The Economics Party
My jaw dropped when I heard that presidential candidate Clinton dismissed the unified opinion of every economist on the planet and supported the gas tax rebate. The rebate is John McCain’s proposal. I think that proves both of them are unqualified to be president. Obama isn’t much better when it comes to sorting out economic policy from pandering, although he did avoid that particular landmine.


So I decided to start my own political party. I call it the Economics Party. There’s no paperwork involved, and you don’t even have to stop being a Democrat or Republican or whatever to join. The Economics Party won’t have its own candidates. All we’ll do is agree to vote for the candidate with the best long term economic policy, according to the consensus of leading economists.


The Economics Party would ignore superstition in its decisions. Here are a few things I think would end up on the platform, assuming most leading economists agree:


- Withdraw from Iraq
- More aggressive energy policy (back off on ethanol)
- More sane tax policies
- Limited government
- Legalize doctor assisted suicide
- Keep abortion legal
- Decriminalize marijuana
- Strong education policy


We’d make some exceptions for humanitarian reasons. For example, if a natural disaster hits a poor part of the country, it might be cheaper to let everyone die, but you have to put life ahead of money at some point.


The platform might look Libertarian, but it has differences. For example, a Libertarian might be opposed to the government making people wear motorcycle helmets. The Economics Party would just look at the likely higher cost of insurance in a helmet-free world and decide on that basis. I don’t know which way it would come out.


The Economics Party would be committed to changing its policy recommendation whenever the facts warranted. We’re pro flip-flop when it makes sense. In other words, our brains function properly.


If thirty or forty million people join the Economics Party, all major candidates would have to start paying attention to the consensus of economists. At the very least, voters would become more aware of what the leading economists think makes sense. That seems like a good thing.

Why Your House Isn’t Energy Efficient
I ran into a friend the other day who is a home builder. He had been planning to build several homes that would be extra-green, both because he wants to help the environment, and because he figured buyers would want that. After much research he abandoned the extra-green approach because he was assured by people in the know that no one would pay extra for an extra-green home. Buyers look at the location, square footage, kitchens, and all the usual stuff. No one even asks about the energy efficiency or indoor air quality.


The next time you go to buy an existing home, ask the real estate agent about the energy costs over the prior year. The agent will look at you like you have a giant turd on your head. I know because I asked that question the last time I was looking at houses. The agent can rattle off the homeowner association fees, tell you the school district, and an impressive array of other details, but never the energy costs.


Suppose you want to build your own energy efficient home. I’m trying to do that right now. So I look on the Internet to get the best information I can get on green building techniques. My federal government has a website filled with what seems to be useful tips. But on closer inspection it is just a laundry list of options with no quantitative comparison of the costs or benefits.


http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12980


All I learn about insulation from the site is that higher R-values are better, except when they are unnecessary. Other sites appear to be funded by manufacturers, so I don’t trust them.


I met with an engineer whose job is to calculate whether your new California house will meet the minimum energy efficiency standards required by the state. I asked about our choice of insulation. I wondered how much I should spend on cranking up the R-values. He told me the walls weren’t nearly as important as the windows, because windows are the weakest link. Okay, fine, so how do I get the best windows?


That’s not so easy. It looks as if the big name window manufacturers carry only windows of average to good energy efficiency while the super efficient windows are made by someone named Karl in his woodshed. And my builder doesn’t know Karl.


Your home isn’t green because you can’t get there from here. I blame the government. It shouldn’t be so hard to make energy efficiency information available in a useful form so buyers and builders can make informed choices.

Youth in Asia
Yesterday I was updating my retirement plan through age 110 and wondered if it was long enough. It seems to me that medical science is progressing so quickly I have a good shot at reaching 140.


This got me thinking. What will happen when medical science can keep almost anyone alive indefinitely, albeit looking like a peach that has been left in the sun for a month? Isn’t it inevitable that assisted suicide will be legal?


There’s no way the global economic system can keep several billion people alive over the age of 100. And if we assume most of those people can vote, and most of them will want at least the option of checking out early, then legalized assisted suicide is a near certainty.


The people over a hundred will want it, and the young people who wish the old people were dead so it would free up resources will want it too. There’s your majority right there.


In the short term, assisted suicide only needs to be legal in one country that has a good airport. Just fly in, let the doctor kill you, and go home in an urn.


Is it inevitable?

How Much Water?
Regarding my previous post, how much water would a typical home have to pump into its own virtual dam in order to provide energy during a typical night while the water flows back out and through a generator?


Are we talking swimming pool size?


How big a container would you need to store the compressed air for the same purpose? Refrigerator size? Garage size?


I have the smartest readers in the world. Someone can probably answer that question on the back of an envelope.

Gravity Battery
In yesterday’s post I mentioned two Israeli companies that allegedly made big breakthroughs with solar power. Many of you noted that solar power is limited if you can’t store the energy in a cost-effective way for night use.


I did some Googling to see what’s new in battery storage, and this potential breakthrough popped up. Obviously it must be viewed skeptically until proven viable.


http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2008/january9/nanowire-010908.html


But I got to thinking that there must be a more natural way to store energy, using gravity. It might not surprise you to learn that I found exactly this sort of idea, appropriately, in the halfbakery.com web site:


http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/energy_20storage_20gravity


http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/Windmill_20Compressor_20Home_20Energy_20System#1121567081


I know, I know, you will point out that even if such systems of energy storage existed, they would be inefficient. It takes more energy to move a rock up a hill than you can capture from the return.


But how inefficient can your storage device be and still be viable? There is some theoretical amount of cheap energy production that compensates for almost any degree of inefficient storage. So if, for example, solar panels became 1,000 times more efficient and cost you next to nothing, it might not matter if your storage device could only capture half of what you generated. You’d still have plenty to get you through the night and charge your electric car too. I think it’s entirely plausible that we’ll have home battery systems, whether gravity based or not, that make oil obsolete except for specialty situations such as jets and maybe big trucks.


Some of you noted that oil has so much energy for its weight that solar power can never be expected to replace it for cars. But that too is more of a function of battery storage. Perhaps the nanowire battery or something like it will solve that. I think it will happen. And I think Israeli companies will be in the forefront, for national defense reasons, while the United States argues about flag lapel pins.

Israel Defeats the Entire Middle East
Yesterday I had one of those oh-my-God moments, the kind where I thought I could see the future. It started by reading some articles about the lack of a serious energy policy in the United States. The problem is that our politicians believe, probably correctly, that they can’t get elected if they propose an energy policy that could work.


Then I stumbled across an article about two Israeli companies that have allegedly made huge breakthroughs in solar power. As with all of these breakthrough stories, you have to assume they are more hype than substance, but take a look:


http://nextbigfuture.com/2008/04/solar-power-breakthroughs-sunrgi-7.html


The oh-my-God moment came when I realized that Israel can destroy all of its local enemies by inventing solar technology that makes oil uneconomical. Such an invention would do more harm than any military attack. And it’s all legal and moral. The politicians and business people in Israel have all the right incentives times a thousand. Their very survival is at risk. Israel is one patent away from crushing every oil producing country in the world.


So that’s my prediction. Whether these latest announcements are real or hype, I think Israel will eventually create the technology to make oil irrelevant to energy production.

Evolution DMD
Let’s stipulate for this conversation that everything the experts say about evolution is true. Creatures that are the most successful at reproducing pass their traits to the next generation, and so on.


But I have another hypothesis that I think is testable. What if there is another influence that also contributes?


I wonder if a creature’s aspirations can somehow have an impact on what her genes pass to the next generation. We know that thoughts are associated with feelings, and feelings are associated with body chemistry. It’s not impossible that wanting something in your lifetime can make it more likely the child achieves it.


Recently I read that certain environmental conditions can increase the odds that women will give birth to boys. So we know that external conditions can influence body chemistry which in turn can influence the genetic makeup of the kid.


So I wonder about the giraffe with its long neck, to pick an easy example. The classic explanation is that giraffes with longer necks could reach leaves higher in trees, and had a survival advantage when food was scarce. That seems reasonable enough. But I wonder if the giraffes that strained and wished they had longer necks experienced some sort of stress, and giraffe-style wishfulness, that released any chemicals that could influence the odds of producing a long-necked child. In other words, do creatures guide their own evolutionary path through their desires?


It seems hugely unlikely that such a complicated and specific system could exist in a creature. But everything about creatures with brains is ridiculously complicated and specific and unlikely. It seems to me entirely plausible that creatures with brains evolved a heretofore undiscovered ability to translate their aspirations in this life to physical traits in their children.


You could test this in female rats. One group is the control, and the other is kept frustratingly a half inch from some delicious cheese. Both rats are fed enough to guarantee equal survival, so the normal mechanism for evolution is turned off. Would the rat who aspired to have a longer snout to reach the cheese produce, on average, longer snouted offspring?


Someone probably tested that already in fruit flies or something.

President McCain
Last night I saw some pundits on the news discussing the results of a poll. When Americans were asked if they would vote for an African-American for president, more than 9 out of 10 people said yes. But when asked if they knew anyone who would not vote for an African-American, about half said they know such a person.


One inference you might make from these results, and the one drawn by the pundits on the show, is that people are secretly racists. They tell pollsters they are not bigots, but once inside the voting booth they are.


The other inference is something I call math. If there are ten friends, and only one is a racist, then it is true that 90 percent are not racists while everyone knows someone who is. It’s that one guy.


Here’s the way I think the election is going to go down. Obama will get nominated, and polls will start to show he will get 95% of the African-American vote. This will frighten all the racists who hadn’t planned to vote, and get them to the polling places, thus handing the election to John McCain, even if he is only being kept alive by machines at that point.


Here’s a little unscientific survey question of my own:


1. Do you personally know anyone who thinks Obama is a Muslim?


2. Do you personally know anyone who suspects Obama might secretly hate America and is running for President to destroy it from within?


I know registered voters in both of those categories. That's why your next president will be named McCain. That's just a prediction, not a preference.

America’s Favorite Pastime
Yesterday I went to a Giants baseball game. It was Little League Day, so there were about ten thousand young boys running wild in the stands. It was also free bat day, courtesy Bank of America.


I will pause while you digest this concept.


Do you know what happens when you hand an 8-year old boy a new bat, sit him behind the exposed heads of several adults, and ask him to sit patiently for four hours while nothing much happens on the big field in front of him? Do you think he fiddles with that bat?


Apparently Bank of America figured there was some theoretical amount of head injuries that would make the public forget that they lent a trillion of your dollars to hobos.


My memory of the afternoon goes something like this: “TREVOR, PUT DOWN THAT BAT! YOU ALREADY HIT THAT LADY ONCE! I SAID, PUT IT DOWN! I MEAN IT! I WILL NOT TELL YOU FOUR HUNDRED MORE TIMES!” This was followed by the sound of wood making solid contact with skull, cursing, repeat.


My wife took a solid blow to the shoulder. Later, one of the tykes kicked some guy’s beer out of the back seat holder, so we sat in a puddle of beer, while the sun cooked us. I was one pinch of salt from being a recipe.


I tried to use the restroom at the stadium. This is no place for the shy. Unlike most public men’s rooms, where there might be a small privacy shield between urinals, this place was designed to handle high volume, shoulder-to-shoulder peeing. I saw an opening where I could poke my penis between a bearded guy and a guy with a fanny pack, just over the left ear of a Little Leaguer, but before I could make my move, someone filled the slot. I decided I could wait another three or four hours.


Conditions were difficult, but at least the game was exciting well into the first half of the first inning when the Reds scored six runs and put it out of reach. Technically, there was still hope, since many of the Giants have batting averages that round to one hundred, and some are able to catch a fly ball nearly half the time. But yesterday was not their day. There were many boos from the stands. I felt bad for the players until I realized they couldn’t hear the boos over the screams of the bat victims.


I wish someone would invent a device that allowed you to watch sporting events from your home. I think that would be popular.

Dilbert.com Redesign
Recently we redesigned the Dilbert.com web site and added a ton of features, such as animation, deeper archives, mash ups, and more. The reaction from readers has been fascinating.


www.dilbert.com


Let me get this out of the way: I realize the Beta version of the web site has lots of issues. It’s overloaded with Flash, slower than it needs to be, and the navigation is confusing. We’re fixing most of that over the next few weeks. I apologize for the inconvenience.


The fascinating thing about the responses is that it revealed three distinct types of Dilbert readers:


The first group is the ultra-techies who have an almost romantic relationship with technology. For them, the new site felt like getting dumped by a lover. Their high-end technology (generally Linux) and security settings made much of the site inconvenient. Moreover, the use of Flash offended them on some deep emotional level.


The second group objected to the new level of color and complexity, and the associated slowness. They like their Dilbert comics simple, fast, and in two colors. Anything more is like putting pants on a cat.


The third group uses technology as nothing more than a tool, and subscribes to the philosophy that more free stuff is better than less free stuff. That group has embraced the new features on the site and spiked the traffic stats.


For you first two groups, if you promise to keep it to yourselves, we created a stripped-down Dilbert page with just the comic, some text navigation, and the archive: www.dilbert.com/fast. This alternate site is a minor secret, mentioned only here and in the text footnote to the regular site as “Linux/Unix.”


The main site will be getting a Flash diet that will make it speedier soon, so check back in a few weeks. That’s where all the fun will be.


Enjoy.

Penis Thefts
In Congo there is a wave of penis thefts.


http://au.news.yahoo.com/080422/15/16ktt.html


Well, add that to the list of reasons for not visiting Congo.


My first reaction to the story was to dismiss it as a bunch of superstitious simpletons caught in a wave of mass hysteria. Then I realized I’ve worked with a few penis shrinking sorcerers myself. I don’t think they do it intentionally. But anyone who can turn a banana into an acorn in five seconds is obviously a witch.


I assume the victims in Congo don’t have access to the Internet. If they did, they’d get hundreds of offers a day for pills that can cure their problem so thoroughly that photographers would try to affix cameras to their heads. Maybe the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation can get those folks together.


This would be a bad time to be a Congo police officer. The first five or six times you have to evaluate the scene of the crime it might seem amusing. After that, you’re just gay. And not impressed.


And what the hell happens when the police dust for prints? The phrase the police inspectors must hear more than any other is “Never mind.”

Gone With the Wind
Did you hear about the priest who tried to set a record for balloon powered flight? This might come as a huge surprise to you: He’s missing.


http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7360416.stm


When I first heard about the incident I figured it was some sort of fund raising stunt to feed the poor. That would have been noble albeit dangerous. But apparently there was no fund raising involved. The priest just wanted to hold the record for balloon riding.


This got me wondering what sort or world record attempt by a priest would piss off God the most. From The Almighty’s perspective, any diversion from the core mission of saving souls is probably time poorly spent. But some types of record attempts have to be worse than others. For example, you don’t want to see your priest winning any kind of pie eating contest. And you don’t want a man of the cloth to hold any titles involving nudity, tequila, or self-gratification, just to name a few. The best a priest could hope for in those cases is that God is busy and doesn’t notice.


But a balloon ride, way up there next to heaven? That’s total smite bait.

New Movie Reviews
Recently I got tricked into seeing a movie that won the Oscar for Best Picture. It left me feeling confused, anxious, and pissed off. By the closing credits I hated everyone involved with it. I actually paid good money for that experience.


As a rule, the quality of a movie is inversely correlated with how long it takes to explain the entire plot. That’s why I stay away from movies with titles like Volcano, Inferno, Titanic, and Snakes on a Plane. I feel I have a sense of where those plots are heading.


The award-winning film I just watched could be described as “A bad guy chases another bad guy and kills him.” There were other elements of the movie, but I’m pretty sure they were irrelevant. Admittedly, there was great artistry in this movie, on many levels. But I don’t think it is fair that no one warned me how it would make me feel. That’s why I think movie reviews should have more elements.


For example, I want to know if a movie has a happy ending, even at the risk of ruining the surprise. Is the arc of happiness something that starts high, dips for dramatic impact then ends on a high note? Or does it start high and just keep dropping until the movie ends and you want to swallow a bottle of sleeping pills? So I recommend an arc description, such as this example:


Arc: High – Low – High


I also want to know the star power. Recently I watched I Am Legend with Will Smith. I enjoyed it only because Will Smith has star power. Even some unknowns have star power. So show me the star power rating, maybe like this:


Star Power: 9


Next, I need to know the mumbling quotient. How many times do you have to turn to the person next to you and ask “What did he say?”


Mumbling Quotient: 7


And how long is this movie? Can my bladder make it all the way or is this a two-pisser?


Bladder: 8


Artistry is important too. How’s the writing, acting, directing, and so forth?


Artistry: 8


I don’t mind violence per se. I can watch hundreds of zombies or henchman get mowed down and still enjoy my popcorn. What I object to is any scene where someone enjoys torturing someone else.


Sadism: 8


A good story is important. Mostly the story needs to be original and make sense. I don’t care about much else.


Originality: 6


I have a hard time with any movie with a plot so complicated I can’t understand it. I have a right to know ahead of time whether I will be able to decipher the story I am paying to see.


Incomprensibility: 4


You also need rankings for humor, scariness, and suspense.


Humor: 7


Scariness: 8


Suspense: 3


That’s all I want to know. Don’t tell me a movie is some particular actor’s best work yet, or the director is at the peak of his powers. That gives me nothing.

APR for Houses
One of the great banking laws in this country is the mandatory APR for loans. That’s a calculation that allows consumers to easily compare loans that have different fees, terms, and rates, making it all apples to apples.


We need the same type of law for home buying. The formula should show the total cost of the home including energy use, water, and maintenance, under some standard set of assumptions.


That sort of number would be a big help to consumers. But more important, it would give home builders an incentive to exceed minimum energy efficiency standards, and make maintenance cheap. At the moment, energy efficiency is somewhat invisible to the buyer. Buyers aren’t willing to pay more for a vague concept. But they might pay more for a home that costs them less in the long run, if they trusted the calculation.


That's my world-saving idea for today. If that doesn't save the world, I will come up with something else tomorrow.

Draft Dodging
This is a hypothetical question to see if our notions of patriotism have changed since I was a kid.


Suppose the draft is reinstituted because there aren’t enough volunteers to fight a hypothetical unpopular war that doesn’t seem to directly threaten the homeland.


Now suppose an individual gets drafted, and his profile is such that the odds of being in combat on the ground are very high. And imagine that this kid is a sensitive type of person who knows that an experience like that will likely give him mental problems for the rest of his life even if he is not wounded.


Some people think, correctly, that they are mentally strong and could come through a war okay if they don’t get physically injured. But others know with a high degree of certainty that experiencing the horrors of war would mentally cripple them for life.


So here’s the question. If a person is relatively certain that going to war will end his ability to enjoy the rest of his life, one way or another, and the war does not present a plausible threat to the homeland, is such a person unpatriotic for dodging the draft to save himself?


The obvious answer is yes, he is unpatriotic. If your country calls on you, you need to go. End of story.


On the other hand, what is the point of a being patriotic to a country that intends to kill you for its own marginal benefit? Such a country would be your natural enemy, not your friend, so any question of patriotism would be nonsense in this particular situation.


Is the draft dodger in this hypothetical situation unpatriotic or simply sensible?

Time Management
Let’s say you have a typical life and try to live it in the healthiest way. You might allocate your 24-hour weekday this way:


Sleep: 8 hours
Exercise: 1 hour
Work: 8 hours
Eating: 2 hours (leisurely)
Hygiene: 1 hour
Travel: 1 (Commute, errands)


That leaves you three hours for family time, sex, shopping, food preparation, chores, household repair, volunteering in the school, and so on. If you have a dentist appointment, or your talkative relative calls, or American Idol has a two-hour special, you’re tapped out.


It’s a challenge to live a happy life if you aren’t giving enough attention to all of those categories, yet doing so is nearly impossible.


One time management strategy is to be independently wealthy, freeing up eight hours a day. But that option isn’t available to many. And apparently it isn’t fulfilling because most rich people continue to work full schedules.


Another strategy is to ignore the fact that you are slowly killing yourself by not sleeping and exercising enough. That frees up several hours a day. The only downside is that you get fat and die.


A third path is to work less than you could, live economically, enjoy each day as it comes, and try not to think about living on cat food when you retire.


Which strategy have you picked?

Oops
My favorite story recently is about the lawsuit to stop the $8 billion Large Hadron Collider out of fear that it might shrink the universe to the size of a gnat turd. And I don’t mean the plump and juicy kind.


http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/science/29collider.html?_r=2&hp&oref=slogin&oref=slogin


One of the reasons I like my job is that the worst mistake I can make is to offend someone, and I enjoy that too. I would never want to be a NASA engineer, for example, knowing that one wrong calculation lands the Space Shuttle on the Sun. And I really, really, really, wouldn’t want to be one of the engineers working on the Large Hadron Collider, no matter how sure I was that it was safe. There’s always that little chance of annihilating the universe, and it’s exactly the sort of mistake I would make.


On the plus side, no one would say, “I told you so.” I guess that would take some of the sting out of it.


I don’t know how you ever get comfortable with any level of risk of destroying the universe. If you were to do an expected value calculation, multiplying the tiny risk times the potential cost, it would still come out infinitely expensive.


And who exactly ran the numbers to decide it wasn’t that risky? After all, the whole point of the Large Hadron Collider is to create conditions that are not predictable. If someone already predicted what would happen using nothing but his laptop and Excel, and determined it was safe, I don’t think we’re getting our $8 billion worth.


I can’t see the management of this project spending $8 billion, realizing it was a huge boner, and then holding a press conference suggesting it be turned into a parking garage. I’ll bet a lot of people in that position would take at least a 5% risk of incinerating the galaxy versus incinerating their own careers. I know I would.


If the lawsuit succeeds, imagine trying to get another job with that project failure on your resume.


Interviewer: “So, you spent $8 billion dollars trying to build a machine that would either discover something cool or destroy the universe. Is it fair to say you are not a people person?”

Vacation Ratio
Today I am going on a two-night trip with the family. The destination promises to be lots of fun. But it takes a lot of research and planning to figure it all out. Then there is the packing and the traveling to and fro, including airports and rental cars and traffic and things that aren’t much fun.


I figure we will sacrifice about three normal days to make two of our other days extra good. Is that worth it?


A month from now I know I will remember the good times and not the sitting at the airport. So the memories will be good. I have a theory that most vacations are about memory upgrades. You become a different person after each trip, literally, as your brain takes on new shapes and chemistry from each experience. I think the selective memory phenomenon is what makes three bad days of planning and travel a worthy trade for two good days of actual vacation.


Clearly there is something wrong with me. But if you are reading this blog, you probably have it too.

Dilbert Product Idea
Someone needs to invent a Dilbert doll for the office that mirrors your mood during the day as the life force is drained from your body. I imagine the little doll sitting there looking all bright and fresh when you come in to work. Over the course of the day, he starts to slump in his chair and turn pale. Eventually he shrivels up like a dried leaf and rolls into a fetal position. That’s when you know it is time to go home.


Misery loves company, so I think people would like having a little Dilbert doll to share the pain.


I’m not sure how you would engineer a toy like that. Perhaps it would be like one of those little sponge animals that you drop in a glass of water and it expands into a much larger one. You could water the Dilbert at the start of each day, making him plump and happy to begin, and he would shrivel up as he dehydrated, eventually curling into a tight little ball.


Watering the Dilbert every day would be a hassle. A mechanical version would be easier, if you could somehow engineer him to change colors and slump and shrivel  and still sell for less than $20.


A number of years ago I worked with design company IDEO to create Dilbert’s Ultimate Cubicle. It had a number of fun features, including a fake flower that sensed motion and reacted when you entered or exited. When you left, it wilted. When you entered, it perked up. Our thinking was that this might be the only time during your workday that your existence was recognized. It would feel good, like being greeted by your dog, but without the drool and fleas. The Dilbert doll could do the same as the flower. He could sleep or slump when you leave, and perk up and start working when you enter. He’d be like a little friend. Wouldn't you want one of those?


Here’s a link to Dilbert’s Ultimate Cubicle. It doesn’t mention the cool flower feature.

Researchers Discover Cause of Voting
Researchers have discovered that people who are incompetent generally lack the knowledge that they are incompetent.


http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/01/18/MN73840.DTL


This lack of self-awareness is the glue that holds democracy together. As long as people feel capable of evaluating complex economic and geopolitical policies, they will keep voting. And as long as people vote, they will feel vested in the system and support it.


As regular readers know, voting is one of the few areas where I recognize my incompetence. That’s why I stay home on election day. In my case, voting would be irrational.


One of the ways I recognize my own political incompetence is by observing how my opinions keep changing. That shouldn’t be happening. For example, a month ago I would have said Obama was the best choice for president because he is an inspirational leader, less divisive than Clinton, and he would bring our troops home from Iraq sooner than McCain. Plus McCain is too old for the job. It all seemed so simple.


Then I read an article that explained how much Obama would tax the people in my bracket compared to McCain’s plan. Ouch. And I started thinking that over time, our all-volunteer army results in fighters who know they will end up in Iraq when they volunteer. That wasn’t the case when the war began, but it becomes that way if we stay indefinitely. Who am I to tell another citizen that he or she should not take that risk for some benefit to the country that he or she perceives?


The war is expensive, but at least McCain would take that money from the middle class majority, and being the majority, they are the ones who would need to elect McCain in the first place. Why would I want to deny the majority the option of voting to pay more taxes than they need to so that I can pay less? They should have that freedom.


If I believed that Obama would pull 100% of our troops out of Iraq, and that Al-Qaeda would surrender because of it, then McCain’s plan of perpetual occupation would look foolish. But as long as Al-Qaeda wants to kill me, no matter what my country does, I’m willing to let volunteers try to shoot them first, as long as other people are paying for the bullets.


The war is bad for Iraqi civilians, but no one knows for sure if they would be worse off without the occupation, given the likelihood of greater civil war. As important as that question is, you have to leave it out of the calculation because it is unknowable.


So I ask myself, isn’t the world better off if I just vote for McCain, buy stock in companies that profit from war, and let everyone else exercise their freedom of choice even if makes them poorer and/or dead?


See why I don’t vote?

Elevator Power and Whatnot
Imagine a 200-pound human traveling by elevator from the 5th floor to the lobby. That is a lot of energy potential that isn’t getting captured. Your descent should be turning a generator or compressing gas or doing something else to power the grid.


How hard could that be?


I also wonder why homes in California aren’t designed to make better use of the stable temperature ten feet beneath the house. It’s always cooler down there during the hot summer. It’s like sitting on a free air conditioner and not using it.


Suppose you dig a ten foot hole, with a ten foot diameter, and fill the hole with a thermal mass that absorbs the surrounding temperature and bleeds it into the thermal mass of the home’s flooring. Wouldn’t that keep the home a lot cooler?


There might be times you wanted to turn off the effect, so I suppose you could engineer it so an insulating layer is applied when needed.


I realize geothermal heating systems are used in cold climates. They just aren’t economical in California because we don’t have the cold extremes.


I remember going into a house in California years ago on a hot summer day and being surprised that the homeowners didn’t need any air conditioning. They had a large attic fan that was drawing out the hot air. Since then I have noticed in a few places I lived that a fan is unnecessary if you have a window in the top floor open and one on the ground floor. The “chimney effect” brings warm air up and out so efficiently the fan is redundant. The only problem is that you don’t want to go to bed with a downstairs window open. That’s why I invented the Jailer Screen Window. It’s a ground floor window you can open, but still has jailer bars to keep out humans, and a screen to keep out bugs. Open that bad boy before bedtime, along with the windows upstairs, and you won’t need AC in the evening.


Okay, I didn't invent the Jailer Screen Window. But I did give it a cool name.


I often think the energy crisis is a failure of imagination.

Hypnotist thief
A man in Italy is allegedly hypnotizing store and bank clerks to give him all of their money.


http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7309947.stm


I’m a trained hypnotist myself, so my first reaction was skepticism. You can’t hypnotize someone that quickly and reliably. But then I put on my criminal mastermind hat and tried to figure out how this crime could be committed as described.


The trick is to hypnotize the targets well ahead of the actual day of the robbery, perhaps several times, and weed out the people who don’t instantly return to the so-called trance state upon suggestion. Then on robbing day, a simple suggestion at the store or bank can produce the instant results you need. The subjects have been pre-trained.


The hard part of this scheme is finding a way to get the right people to agree to hypnosis ahead of time. I imagine he advertised in a local publication, offering to help people quit smoking or lose weight. When people called for an appointment he would ask what sounded like standard questions, including age and occupation. If someone had the right sort of job, he set up an appointment and started the process. On any given day, he could hypnotize several new clients while testing for the most susceptible subjects who also handle money.


The next part would be a bit tricky. You can’t get a hypnotized person to do something that would violate his basic sense of right and wrong, or to put himself in danger. The brain has some sort of safety mechanism to prevent that.


In the surveillance video on the web, the hypnotist is seen taking the money from the register himself while the clerk seemed to be watching. This might be part of his workaround. The clerk wasn’t committing the crime so much as observing it. And perhaps the hypnotist said he was borrowing the money, or the manager had asked him to bring it to him in the parking lot, or some other story that obscured the ethical boundaries.


It could work. He’d need to be an excellent hypnotist, but that isn’t so rare.

Hospital Mistake
You readers are sick people. Many of you forwarded me the article about a German woman went to the hospital for a leg operation and got an anus operation instead, as if I would make light of such a thing.


http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,339270,00.html


When the woman complained to the hospital CEO that she was given a new anus, did the CEO say, “I’ll look into it”?


I think the woman should act as her own attorney. After she gives her closing argument she can sit down and say, “I rest my case.”


Add your own jokes. The ones I already got by e-mail include “She got a bum deal,” and “The doctors tore her a new one.”

Iraq’s Path to Democracy
I’m no historian, but it seems to me the path to democracy always goes through a warlord stage. The warlords have different names in different places. In the United States we had the robber barons, media barons, unions, and organized crime who effectively controlled the government. In England they had land barons foisting the Magna Carta on the king. In modern Russia it looks as if the billionaire criminals are running the country.


It seems to me that Iraq is right on track. The country is organizing itself around warlords and clerics, and they will eventually work out truces with each other. In the long run, those warlords or their successors will find their own greatest self-interest in supporting some form of national government while maintaining local control.


As the national government grows through taxation, it eventually becomes more powerful than any individual warlord and can start picking them off one at a time, just as the government of the United States targeted the Mafia.


Is Iraq on the only realistic path that can get it to a functional democracy?

Natural Meat Eaters
As a vegetarian, I often find myself drawn into debates about whether humans are natural meat-eaters. I’d have to say “almost.”


Clearly meat is nutritious for humans, our teeth can handle the job, and most meat-eaters love a well-cooked steak. But to say we are natural meat-eaters, I would think two things would have to be true:


1. Eating lots of meat wouldn’t increase your health risks.
2. Seeing a cow would make you salivate if you were hungry.


For now, I will ignore the first point because experience tells me that meat-eaters will argue to the death (literally) that eating meat has no health risks.


The interesting point, to me, is why so-called natural meat eaters feel the need to disguise their food by cutting it into steaks, cooking it, and covering it with barbecue sauce. If eating meat is natural, you would expect it to make you hungry in its natural condition. Looking at a cow should make you salivate when you are hungry.


Am I wrong?


[Update: To answer your rhetorical questions, yes, I do salivate when seeing raw vegetables and fruit. An orange or banana would make most people salivate if they were hungry. But I also like raw peas in a pod, even raw potatoes.]

Achievable Goals
The key to happiness is setting achievable goals. For example, I think a bad goal is trying to find enlightenment, or becoming one with the universe. That has hard work written all over it. I was thinking about this recently because of the story in the news about the 35-year old woman who stayed in her bathroom until her skin fused with the molecules in the toilet seat.


http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/03/13/woman.in.bathroom.ap/index.html


While it might be hard to become one with the universe, apparently it is easier to become one with your own toilet. All you need is a boyfriend who is willing to slip pizzas under the door.


While we’re on the topic of the boyfriend, I also think he did a good job of setting his goals low in terms of girlfriends. If you’ve ever had a high maintenance relationship, I think you can appreciate the subtle beauty of his arrangement. This fellow found a girlfriend who never complained. Can you top that?


I see this woman as a pioneer in the evolution of humankind. Her life might sound boring to you, but imagine if she had a laptop in there, with a wireless Internet connection. Suddenly a bad idea starts to look rather brilliant. For most of us, moving from place to place is usually about seeking food, bathroom breaks, employment, conversation, sexual stimulation, and returning to the computer. That’s a lot of time wasted moving around. A laptop and a toilet can satisfy all of those needs. You can even order food online. I’m not ready to make that sort of commitment yet myself, but I’d be lying if I told you I didn’t give it some serious thought.

Beauty as God
In Yesterday’s Blog Post, I asked if the fact that all creatures with brains and eyes have some innate and individual sense of beauty is evidence of God. For the most part, believers said yes or maybe, and non-believers asked what is wrong with me.


In fairness, I didn’t develop that question enough for it to make sense. I was operating on insufficient sleep. I’ll take another crack at it. You might be surprised how well this comes together. Or not.


If there is a God, I have hypothesized before that it could be the expression of a single and original universal law of nature so powerful that all the other rules of physics spring from it. And all the anthropomorphic qualities that believers often ascribe to God are only different descriptions of that one universal law. It would be fair, albeit imprecise language, to say this God of universal law is omnipotent and loving and the creator of everything.


I observed that people are attracted to particular mates based on individual concepts of beauty. But they are also attracted to certain styles of clothes, cars, music and so on. We see beauty in lots of things. And we observe that gravity and magnetism and other natural forces are some form of attraction. Every bit of reality is experiencing some form of attraction to some other bits of reality.


Human attraction feels entirely different from gravity. But remember that all the laws of physics seem entirely different from each other, but there has long been a belief they could all be explained or connected by a so-called unified field theory.


Consider how evolution explains both the human eye and a bird’s wing. Those two things seem completely unrelated to each other, but spring from the same underlying set of rules. As with that example, I am asking if the pervasiveness of our preferences for beauty springs from the same force as gravity and magnetism, to name just a few examples. All seem to be a related to attraction.


If the universe did not have a natural preference for attraction over separateness, then animals would not look for food, people would not procreate, and planets would not orbit. Even evolution springs from this most basic of forces. Without attraction, no creatures would produce offspring.


Attraction, which we humans usually interpret as beauty in our daily lives, is perhaps the most universal of all the laws. Is it a stretch to suppose that attraction is the hypothetical one most basic and original law of all? And if so, can one be forgiven for labeling it God?

Preferences
Women prefer taller men. That’s probably a good thing from an evolutionary perspective. If the preference worked in the other direction, eventually our descendants would evolve smaller and smaller until squirrels ate them.


The usual explanation for why humans have certain preferences in mates is because the preferred traits signal good health, and that is an advantage for baby-making.


But what if those preferences are just coincidences? For example, I have clear preferences for some types of automobile designs, but I don’t want to hump those cars and produce tricycles.


My hypothesis of evolution is that every creature with eyes and a brain has a sense of beauty that coincidentally overlaps with health, but is independent. Studies have shown that mood is directly affected by the color and design of your environment. Most people prefer being on a beach or in the mountains compared to a cubicle. But you don’t prefer the beach or mountain because you want to have their babies. They just make you feel good.


Even your dog has a preferred place in the house or in the yard, for whatever doggie reasons he has.


I think you choose your mate based on a personal sense of beauty.  And if your environment only has a few choices, you pick the one with the most beauty, relatively speaking.


You can see some divergence between beauty and reproductive health in popular culture. Models and actresses are often too thin to appear as optimal baby-makers while still considered highly attractive.


Bonus philosophical question: If all creatures with brains have an innate and individual sense of beauty, is that evidence of God?

Ultimate One-Story House Plan Update and Ultimate Future City
I got to bed late last night, so today’s post is lame and rambling, just like always. I decided to update my ultimate one-story house plan, and also describe the ultimate future city.


See my previous posts for details that make the one-story floor plan special. In this update I made a few tweaks toward perfection based on your comments.


1. Moved the kid bathroom to the end of the hall connecting their two bedrooms.


2. Added a guest bathroom off the laundry room, with an entry past a fountain for maximum privacy while still being central to the house.


3. Moved the mud room to the garage entrance.


click to enlarge.


House_design_one_story2


Someone asked about the ultimate city plan. I have that too, conceptually.


The biggest problem with any city is all the traffic. And much of that traffic can be avoided if the city is designed right. I imagine homes above ground, connected by a network of underground bike and robot paths.


The bike paths would allow weather-free, flat paths, and parking, from anywhere to anywhere in the city. No cars to contend with, and wide enough for senior citizens to putter around in their trikes while kids zip around in the fast lane.


The robots would be like larger versions of the Roomba vacuum cleaning robot, but designed to pick up and deliver merchandise and food from one place to another. Every home would have an elevator to the underground area where the robots would deliver goods and wait for you to unload.


Imagine ordering anything you want over the Internet, and your cell phone alerts you when the delivery robot is waiting beneath your house to be unloaded. It can wait all day, because there are plenty of robots to go around. The robots would have their own dedicated paths, separate from the bikes, and accessible only by service technicians.


Commuting would be unnecessary if your co-workers and most customers also lived in the city. Each home would be equipped with a home office (or two) that provides the ultimate telecommuter setup. Just insert your earpiece and have your avatars hold online virtual meetings. If you need to courier documents or prototypes, the underground robots do it in minutes.


Homes would be built in clusters around comprehensive health club facilities, like the one near me, www.ClubSports.com. It has everything from spa facilities to yoga to tennis to rock climbing to dancing. Membership would be included in city taxes, and would pay for itself in reduced healthcare.


When you needed to travel beyond your block, but within the city, taxis and public transit would do most of that job.


That’s the basic outline of the ultimate future city. It still needs work.

You Had Me at A**hole
I have a new favorite politician. I have no interest in his policy stance or effectiveness, but somehow that doesn’t matter. My new hero is French President Sarkozy.


Recently he was making his way through a crowd for some public event and went to shake the hand of a man who said, “Don’t touch me. You’ll make me dirty.” Sarkozy replied, “Then get out of here, you total a**hole.” Some have interpreted it as “jerk” and not “a**hole,” but that only makes the story better, knowing there is more than one interpretation. You get your reasonable deniability delivered on the fly. Impressive.


Here’s a link: http://blog.eitb24.com/odds/2008/02/24/-casse-toi-alors-pauvre-con-/


So I went to Wikipedia to see more about the Sarkozy cat, and found this gem:  “As mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine, Sarkozy met former fashion model and public relations executive Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz (great-granddaughter of composer Isaac Albéniz and of a Russian father), when he officiated at her wedding[15] to television host Jacques Martin. In 1988, she left her husband for Sarkozy, and divorced Martin one year later.”


Dude.


Sarkozy officiated at the former fashion model’s wedding and, I’m guessing, slipped the bride his phone number. Apparently that worked.


But the marriage didn’t, so after Sarkozy wore out one former model, he traded up to another, Carla Bruni, and married her recently.


I’m sure I would find plenty to dislike about Sarkozy if I bothered to read about his political views. But I’d hate to ruin a good first impression.


My point is that you shouldn’t let a French guy officiate your wedding.

Drunken Lemurs Strike Back
In this week’s Dilbert, Wally is fired for posting a comic that calls managers drunken lemurs. There’s some background to that story, in case you missed it yesterday on Good Morning America.


http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/WaterCooler/story?id=4323900


And here’s the link to the Dilbert series that continues for a few more days.


http://dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20080220.html


One of my ongoing problems in the strip is trying to restore things back to their normal Dilbert universe after something dramatic happens, such as a death or firing or company takeover. Today you will learn, if you don’t already know, a literary phrase that describes how lazy authors resolve this sort of thing.


The phrase is “deus ex machina.” It refers to a bad writer’s trick of having some improbable character arrive at the end of a story and conveniently solve all the problems. It’s considered a cop-out. I use it frequently because comics need quick solutions, and I have plenty of improbable characters to choose from. Look for the deus ex machine to help Wally get his job back in the next few days.


And next time you want to impress someone with your literary knowledge, drop a deus ex machine on them. Act surprised that anyone doesn’t know what it means. More on that phrase…


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina


Since I know you will ask, in the ABC video I am drawing on a Wacom Cintiq 21UX monitor, which is how I create the strip. Here’s a link that shows it:

Ultimate Single Story House - update
See the latest updates highlighted.


The goal is to have a house with the best design for the money, not necessarily the cheapest. But you could easily add or subtract from this design to hit almost any budget.


If you aren’t interested in house plan designs, and most of you aren’t, I hope you are interested in the process of “open design,” where hordes of people essentially guide the design. I started with a basic idea, and your comments have guided it.


Many of you complained about my two-story house plan. Having recently injured my knee playing tennis (not badly), I have a new level of sympathy for that view. What follows is a single-level design, with an optional basement, based on your comments.


Click to enlarge.


House_design_one_story2


Based on your comments, I put the laundry room near the center of the action part of the house, so you can watch the kids and prepare meals without traveling to laundry Siberia and back. I even designed a rolltop window in the laundry room where you can do the ironing while facing out to the big screen TV. Noise wouldn’t be that big of a deal if you soundproofed the walls and only opened the rolltop window when others weren’t around. I retained the closets that open to bedrooms and to the laundry room. This house makes doing laundry almost fun. (And realistically, the person who does the laundry usually decides what house you live in.)


I moved the guest/kid bathroom to the end of the house. No one wanted it anywhere near the kitchen or living area.


I added a front porch because those are relatively inexpensive, energy friendly, and provide lots of outdoor enjoyment. This is the large and useful kind of porch, not the purely cosmetic type you see on new houses these days. And it faces the primary sun direction to keep the home cool.


I kept the storage room concept adjacent to the main living area, and added a door from storage to the garage, based on comments. This is the room that keeps all your party stuff, exercise equipment, holiday decorations, extra chairs and tables, and anything else you need to change the function of the living area on the fly.


If you aren’t sold on the storage room concept yet, and you have kids, imagine that it also contains what I call Toy Jail. Anything that isn’t picked up by the kids gets thrown in a big box (the Toy Jail) in the storage room.


There is one dining area, casual enough for every day, but imagine it designed with a restaurant ambiance, so you wouldn’t be embarrassed entertaining friends there either. And after dinner, the big screen comes down from the ceiling for a movie. A home theater seems like an excess, but prices are dropping fast, and if it is included in the original design of the house, and you plan to use it a lot, it makes sense.


The front entrance is off the family room, with a mud room, and a small foyer that is business only. Every inch of the home that gets heated or cooled is useful.


The Cat's bathroom is in the master bathroom. If you have allergic house guests, just lock the cat in the master bedroom and it has all it needs.


The home office is moved off toward the garage and kitchen side, and is on its own heating/cooling zone. It's close to the kitchen for convenience.


The optional basement steps are moved to near the entrance from the garage.


The game room is moved next to the family room, separated by a two-way fireplace.


All bedrooms have windows now.


Bathrooms reduced from five to two. You could always add them back to bedrooms without changing the overall design too much.


The master bedroom got a retreat/sitting area just to square things off.


So there it is, the ultimate house, designed by you. How’s it look now?

Agism
In yesterday’s post I said, “A 71-year old man like McCain is mentally slower and less flexible than a younger person, and more likely to have his job performance impacted by a major illness.” Many of you objected to my agism.


It appears that there were three reasons for objecting:


1. The commenter interpreted my statement to mean every old person is mentally slower than every young person, which would be stupid.


2. The commenter objects to agism on principle.


3. McCain is obviously healthy and energetic and smart enough for the job.


The first two categories aren’t worth a response. I will address the third point, that McCain is an exception.


First, I will acknowledge the possibility that the smartest and most creative person in the world could be 100 years old. That could happen if, for example, that person started as the smartest person in the world and didn’t decline much. What isn’t likely is that the smartest person in the world started out in the middle of the pack and got smarter after the age of 70.


I will also acknowledge that a mentally active person, such as John McCain, can reduce the normal rate of mental decline associated with age. And with experience he might acquire more relevant knowledge while only forgetting things that aren’t much use on the job, such as his old high school locker combination.


Here’s a link showing that older people can stave off the typical mental decline associated with age by “training” their brains: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/19/AR2006121900901.html


I will also acknowledge that if you were hiring someone to work for your own company, the 71-year old could be the most qualified candidate. But the odds of that happening decrease as the applicant pool increases. The presidency has an unusually large pool of applicants.


And the job at your company is unlikely to be similar in mental requirements to being President of the United States. It’s hard to imagine a job that would require more mental dependability than Commander in Chief.


We have one recent experience with an older president: Reagan. And his mental functioning was clearly impaired by age. While you might argue that Reagan’s results as a president were good, you have to acknowledge the risk involved in having a president who isn’t thinking clearly.


John McCain’s current mental ability does appear up to the task of being president. But like Reagan, he’s at an age where decline can happen quickly. He’s unlikely to be the same man at the end of the first term, much less a potential second term. While it is entirely possible – even probable – he could keep his mind sharp enough to do the job, the odds are unambiguously better for a younger candidate.


President of the United States isn’t the sort of job where “sufficient” is good enough. I have every reason to believe a 71-year old would be sufficient. The odds of being exceptional are much lower.


In other professions, how often do people over the age of 70 produce innovative or exceptional results? Look around your home or office and ask yourself how many of the technical innovations came from senior citizens. How many of the best selling books on your shelf were written by senior citizens who weren’t already famous? How many senior citizens wrote the music you have on your iPod?


You will be tempted to point out exceptions to the rule. Warren Buffet is a good example. But he plans to retire. Alan Greenspan already did. Evidently they think age matters.


If you think age isn’t a factor in the presidency, would you vote for a candidate who was 100-years old and healthy?

Making Decisions
I’m fascinated by how people make decisions when faced with lots of unknowns, such as when they pick a presidential candidate to support.


The usual method, as far as I can tell, is to pick what you think is the most important of the unknowns, take your best guess about it, and base your entire decision on that one factor. For example, you might say, “That candidate would be better at boosting the economy.” But you don’t really know. Even the experts don’t know.


The “guessing about unknowns” approach makes sense if you can reliable assign odds to the unknown. In reality, that’s rarely the case. So I take a different approach. I make my decision entirely on the elements I know for sure.


Take the war in Iraq as an example for this method of decision making. While I have a preference for leaving soon, I have no way of knowing whether that makes the world a safer or more dangerous place in the long run. I’ve heard good arguments both ways. But I do know for certain that fewer American soldiers would be targets if they left. And I know that staying is a lot more expensive than leaving. Anything else I think I “know” about Iraq is a hunch at best. So based on what I know for sure, I favor an early pull-out.


On the economy, immigration, health care, and the handling of special interest groups, I have no idea if Obama or Clinton or McCain would handle things better. I don’t even know if the liberals would raise my taxes more than the conservative. Those are all complete unknowns to me.


So what are the knowns? Here’s my starter list:


1. A President Obama would a huge step toward racial healing.


2. A President H. Clinton would be a symbolic gain for women, but it wouldn’t be a clean win because her husband would be seen as highly influential in making it happen.


2. A President Clinton would be scandal bait for the press.


3. A 71-year old man like McCain is mentally slower and less flexible than a younger person, and more likely to have his job performance impacted by a major illness.


4. McCain would nominate more conservative judges to the Supreme Court compared to either Clinton or Obama.


5. Obama and Clinton would remove troops from Iraq sooner than McCain.


I’m sure this list needs to be longer. Feel free to add to it. And watch the comments to see how often people say they know things that are clearly unknowable.


[Update: In a prior post I told you that last year I promised a friend who raises funds for McCain that if the surge worked, I would donate $1,000 to the campaign. While the jury is still out on whether it “worked” in any lasting and meaningful way, I decided against weaseling out of my promise. I donated $1,000 to John McCain. But I didn’t feel good about it.]

Ultimate House Plan (Take two)
On February 14th I posted my idea for the ultimate house plan that wastes little space and is efficient. People weighed in with their comments. I incorporated many of those comments in the new design and drew it so you can see it. Your comments included:


1. The kitchen and laundry rooms should have views. (Done)


2. Laundry rooms next to bedrooms would be too noisy. In the new design, the bedrooms are separated by a closet, so there would be two walls to block the sound. One bedroom is across the hall, but still near.


3. The pantry is right off the garage, for all those warehouse store purchases.


4. The big storage room is wasted space for heating and cooling. I moved it adjacent to the garage, where it doesn't need to be heated or cooled, depending on your climate and what you want to keep in there.


5. Move the bathroom away from the kitchen. (Done)


6. Add a cat's bathroom. (Done.)


7. Update: I made the downstairs bathroom more private and added a front entrance.


8. Update: Okay, okay, I added a straight stairway and pushed the bathroom further from the TV area.


Remember, a big part of this concept is that you can change the function of the all-purpose family room by switching out items from the storage room. You can pull out your holiday decorations, add tables and chairs to the dining area, or more seating for watching a movie on the big screen. All of your party and entertaining items would be in that handy storage room. You could even keep your exercise bike in there and push it out when you want to use it (which is easier than it sounds).

Define Evil
Suppose a stranger starts beating you with a stick for no reason other than his own entertainment. He’s got you cornered, and no one is around to help. Luckily for you, he loses his grip on the stick, and drops it. You grab his stick, and without it the stranger can’t stop you from escaping.


Are you evil for ruining his fun and stealing his stick for your own selfish happiness?


It seems like a stupid question, but based on the comments to yesterday’s blog, many of you think the stick stealer is evil and has oppressed the assailant who was minding his own business beating you to death.


For example, several people said cigarette smokers are being oppressed by non-smokers, presumably for banning smoking in public places, and that this oppression qualifies as evil. Clearly the non-smokers are taking away rights from smokers, for their own selfish purposes, just like the guy who stole the stick. But is protecting your health evil?


Even if you believe that exposure to second-hand smoke isn’t dangerous, banning it for health reasons wouldn’t be evil, just scientifically unjustified. To qualify as evil, I think you need some evil intent.


Polygamy was a good answer to yesterday’s question. The majority does oppress the minority’s right to multiple spouses. One could argue that given the roughly equal number of young men and women, polygamy denies many men the option of marriage and reproduction. So banning it increases fairness in society. Even if the reasons for banning polygamy seem ridiculous to you, the net effect on society is more fairness. That doesn’t seem evil to me.


Atheists were often mentioned as a minority that is oppressed by the majority. But that oppression is not government sponsored, so it doesn’t count in the context of my question about setting public policy by majority opinion.


Gay marriage was mentioned often. The majority of Americans support gay civil unions, with all the rights of marriage. But the majority is against calling it marriage. To many of you, that seems evil.


To the majority of Americans, the issue boils down to “Please don’t take our special word for God’s holy bond between a man and a woman.” Religions are supposed to discriminate between what they consider right and wrong. To deny that right, within reason, is to deny freedom of religion.


Personally, I favor gay marriage because I think the law should be gender neutral whenever it is practical. And I’m not superstitious; to me, a word is just a word. But is it evil for the majority to protect certain combinations of letters that have deep meaning to them? It seems more silly than evil.


I understand how gays would gain something intangible and important by use of the word marriage. But if the majority of religious people feel they would be losing something just as important to them, then letting the majority win is the fairest solution for society, and therefore not evil.


I might be missing the nuances of the gay marriage debate. If so, let me know what I’m missing.


Keep an eye on the comment count today. This should be interesting.

Majority Rule
In a recent post I said that if elected president I would support the majority view for social issues. Readers jumped all over that as a recipe for oppressing minorities.


Would that oppression happen?


Most Americans are not gay, but the majority supports gay rights. Most Americans don’t want to kill themselves, but the majority favors legal euthanasia. Most Americans don’t use drugs, but still favor legalizing or decriminalizing drugs. Most Americans are religious, but favor the separation of church and state.


Leading contenders for the job of president of the United States include a woman, an African-American, and a Mormon. It took a few hundred years, but the country has finally wised up to the fact that we’re all minorities in some way or form.


Help me think through this question by giving me some CURRENT examples in which the majority in the United States would suppress a particular minority in some way that is clearly evil.


I’m willing to change my mind on this issue if you have some good examples where majority rule in the modern United States would be evil. Seriously. But the only oppression that comes to mind for me involves one minority in the United States (usually a religious minority) using the government to oppress other minorities (for example gays).


So when would the majority choose to oppress a minority? Exclude in your examples anything involving economics or national defense. Those areas would be guided by experts in my hypothetical administration.

She Amazed Me – the Music Video
Several blog posts ago, I observed that many popular songs have nonsense lyrics. So I asked readers to submit random lyrics that could be strung together to create a hit song that means absolutely nothing.


German band RIVO DREI took it one step further by putting the best random lyrics together, writing the music, and performing it.


Now the final piece falls into place. Dilbert Blog reader Jem8472, who wishes to be otherwise anonymous, has created the music video and posted it to youtube.


http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=TiH9dbAsAp0


The funniest thing about this whole exercise is that it works. You can convince yourself the lyrics mean something to someone, they sound great put to music, and the music video is completely entertaining.


If you know any musicians, send them a copy so they can see how it is done.

How to Get Elected President
I wouldn’t want to be president. I worry enough about being assassinated for what I write on this blog. There’s no point in making it worse. But that doesn’t stop me from thinking about how I would run my campaign.


If I ran for president, I’d have to get past the country’s distaste for atheists. That’s a big problem. I would handle it by manipulating the media with a sound bite so catchy the pundits would have no choice but to repeat it until it started to sound sensible. I’d hold a press conference and say that ONLY an atheist should be president, in the same way you want a eunuch to guard your harem. (That’s the sound bite. It’s like catnip for pundits.)


I would suggest that a truly religious president might try to convert your children to his religion, either overtly or by example. In this election alone, you have a Mormon, a Baptist or two, and if Bloomberg enters, a Jew. Moreover, a scary percentage of the South believes Obama is a Muslim. I’d play the fear card.


After my eunuch sound bite got everyone’s attention, I would soften the message to “Only an atheist can guarantee religious freedom for all by favoring none.” That argument makes no sense whatsoever, but it would be persuasive nonetheless.


Next, I would promise to maintain all social benefits for anyone who is already over sixty. That would guarantee me the senior citizen vote. Obviously it is not a campaign promise I would have much chance of keeping, but that’s a problem for later. And I would portray all the other candidates as a risk to senior citizens.


Younger voters might have a problem with my complete lack of political experience. I would deal with that by announcing in advance my picks for cabinet, Vice President, Chief of Staff, and other key positions. I would simply pick the most popular and/or qualified people in the world, such as Oprah, Colin Powell, and Warren Buffet. All of those people would immediately denounce me and deny interest in the jobs, obviously. But I would tell the voters they are only saying that because I am not yet the president. When the president asks someone to serve the country, they tend to say yes. And if any of them do eventually say no, for now they are a good example of who I would pick for those sorts of jobs. I would point out that the other candidates will be appointing worthless political cronies, as always.


I would promise that my approach to social issues would mirror the majority opinion. Unlike the other candidates, I would not try to hold your family hostage to my personal views. I would argue that a president’s role in social issues is to guarantee the minority doesn’t oppress the majority, not to impose my own biases. If someone has a pet social issue, I would tell them to convince the majority of the country, not me.


For international issues, I would promise to follow the advice of the most qualified experts in each field. And I would dismiss any specific policy questions as “hypothetical questions” that only an idiot would answer. I would portray the other candidates as either liars or reckless for not naming their future advisors in advance, and not committing to listening to people who know more than they do.


Do I have your vote?

Scientists Disprove Evolution
That got your attention, didn’t it?


Scientists haven’t disproved evolution. But I found it interesting that some cosmologists are putting a lot of effort into doing just that, albeit indirectly.


To be fair, in this context, the cosmologists can’t prove a negative. They can’t demonstrate that evolution didn’t happen. They can only show that evolution is infinitely unlikely compared to an alternative explanation.


That potentially better explanation, subject to much dispute, is the idea that your existence and consciousness is far more likely to be a free-floating brain created instantly by random fluctuations of the universe, and imbued with false memories of your past.


http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/science/15brain.html?_r=1&oref=slogin


I don’t think the free-floating brain theory will ever replace the standard concept of time or evolution. But it’s fascinating that scientists are working on it.


So here is my question of the day for people who accept evolution as a fact: If cosmologists someday reached a consensus that free-floating brains are infinitely more likely than our current notion of reality, would you agree with the following statement:


“The theory of evolution is false.”

Your Job When You Grow Up
When I was a kid growing up in a small town, and I imagined my future, I could think of maybe fifty types of careers. They were all the obvious ones: lawyer, doctor, veterinarian, banker, store clerk, mailman, cartoonist, etc.


I always wonder how different the world would be if kids knew there are a million jobs in the world to choose from, and not just fifty. Would kids start early to prepare for careers as videographers or dolphin trainers if they knew how cool those jobs were?


I was thinking of this recently while working with a Dilbert licensee. They make fluorescent light diffusers for your office ceiling, with images such as the sky with clouds, or Dilbert characters looking down at your cube. Very cool: www.skyscapes.biz


So I imagine 5-year old Timmy, when asked what he wants to do for a career, answering “When I grow up, I want to make fluorescent light diffusers with Dilbert characters. They are the perfect item for adding some visual relief to drab cubicle farms.”


Timmy would die a virgin.


If you get one of these Skyscapes, let me know how you use it in your office. Was it a reward for an employee of the month, a way to make the break room livelier, or an easier way to show people where the printer is. I’ll even post your picture in this blog as you pose beneath the Skyscape. And if you are getting paid while you do it, that’s another job you didn’t imagine when you were five.

The Hit Song You Wrote
The other day I asked you to contribute nonsense lyrics that could be combined into a hit song, under the theory that many hit songs have nonsense lyrics, so writing them can’t be that hard.


A band in Germany, called RIVO DREI (http://www.rivodrei.de/en/) picked out the best of your nonsense lyrics and strung them together to create an actual song that is a sure hit. The random lyrics sound amazingly like they might mean something deep if only you concentrated a little harder. And it’s catchy. These guys are brilliant, on a variety of levels, including marketing, obviously.


Here’s a link to the song, assuming the server doesn’t have traffic issues. The lyrics are pasted below.

She Amazed Me
------------------------


She had runaway eyes and marshmallow kittens.
My heart heard a dream like ten thousand mittens.


A tear in her hand
She spread deja-vu all across the land.


br:
She spinned round and round with a frog in her ear
Whispering fountains and rocks she couldn't hear


ch:
Oh, she amazed me!
With her love, she tazed me.
Oh, she amazed me!
And it escapes me
how she outer spaced me.


Too many times I have seen the thunder
Flashes of sound, soul-rending sunder


A letter colored blue...
Now the nine bells are ringin' and singin' it too


br:
She spinned round and round with a frog in her ear
Whispering fountains and rocks she couldn't hear


ch:
Oh, she amazed me!
With her love, she tazed me.
Oh, she amazed me!
And it escapes me
how she outer spaced me.


br:
Little did she know they were coming too soon,
Both those kittens ran off to the moon


ch:
Oh, she amazed me!
With her love, she tazed me.
Oh, she amazed me!
And it escapes me
how she outer spaced me.
Oh, she amazed me!
With her love, she tazed me.
Oh, she amazed me!
With splendid reprisal, she took to the sky.
My tear drops asunder. No shadow. No cry.
Apple core ostriches dancing like fairies.
And it escapes me
how she outer spaced me.

Death by Media
In 1997 The Dilbert Future was published. One of my predictions was that the media would start killing celebrities just to generate new sensational headlines. I based this prediction on three inescapable truths:


1. The media can influence people’s actions
2. Death is the most interesting form of news
3. The news business is a capitalist enterprise


Therefore, it makes sense that the media would eventually start influencing the deaths of people who are in some way fascinating. There’s a huge financial incentive to do so.


An argument can be made that the media killed Princess Diana, indirectly, by influencing the reckless actions that led to her demise. That happened soon after my prediction was published. Lots of people wrote to tell me how spooky it was. Britney Spears is probably next.


Arguably, Saddam Hussein was a celebrity of sort, along with his sons. One view is that the government of the United States ordered the military to kill all three of them, and used the media as a tool to do it. Another way to look at it is that the media used the government to kill three celebrities. It wouldn’t have happened without the media’s view on WMDs and the national support it generated for the war.


While the media did not originate the idea of war in Iraq, the government is full of people with ideas on killing other people, and they don’t all happen. It is the media who selects from among the many ideas and makes some reality. If the media had ignored the calls for war with Iraq, or treated the WMD situation as crazy alarmist talk, the war in Iraq wouldn’t have happened. But war is big money for the media, especially with a celebrity dictator in the mix, so there was a tremendous incentive to help it along.


By way of contrast, the United States didn’t send the military to Rwanda to stop genocide. Some think racism was the reason. Others say the lack of oil was the reason. Maybe the real reason is that you can’t name a single famous person in Rwanda. If O.J. Simpson got elected king of Rwanda, and trouble broke out, the media would make it a story, and the government would be influenced by the public to order the military to kill O.J.


When I read stories of Russia’s Putin controlling the media in his country, I ask myself how that compares to my country. On one hand, control of the media guarantees that the government will get away with things it shouldn’t get away with. On the other hand, it will keep the Russian media from pushing Russia into war. Is that a good trade-off?


My regular readers know I like to toss out provocative ideas and see what happens. It’s a complicated world, and no one theory explains everything people do. But it is worth asking whether the policies in a free country favor directions that would lead to a celebrity death.

I’m Determined
I take pride in small accomplishments. For example, I have always been proud that I could take any medicine, no matter how awful, without complaining. This is an extension of my greater power of liking, or at least tolerating, almost any food taste. It’s a gift. Recently, I met my match.


The other day, I felt a possible cold coming on, and started looking through the drawer where we keep all our meds, to see if we had one of those cold preventive pills, with the zinc in them. I recalled reading that they work. And placebo or not, they seemed to work for me in the past.


I found in the drawer a type of medicine my wife had purchased that I hadn’t seen before. It was a chewable pill, about the size of a very thick quarter. It would take some time to work through it, but it was no obstacle to the man who could take any medicine. I popped it in my mouth and started working.


At first it was pleasant, citrus-like. But the flavor just kept coming. It went from mild to strong in about ten seconds. By half a minute, it was so intense my eyes were watering, and I had only chewed about 10% of this pill. I started to worry.


A minute into it, it was so intense I thought I was going to puke, literally. I ran to the kitchen sink to spit it out, but gave it a few more seconds to see if I could get through it. No medicine had beaten me yet, and I wasn’t going to go down easy. The waves of nausea blew over me, and I knew one of them was going to put me over the edge. It was time to bail. I spit the rest of the pill into the sink, defeated.


Later, I blamed it on having just brushed my teeth. You know how sometimes particular foods are awful if you just brushed? I figured that was the problem. So the next day, determined, I took another run at it. This time I made sure I hadn’t brushed in the past hour. It started out better, I thought, but it ended with me slumped over the bathroom sink, eyes watering, trying to suppress the retching. I gazed at the half eaten pill dissolving in the drain, beaten. It was a lonely feeling.


I mentioned this defeat to my wife, Shelly. She informed me that the pills aren’t actually pills at all. They are designed to be dissolved in a tall glass of water, like Alka Seltzer.


I worry that this event undercut the aura of infallibility I have been cultivating in my marriage.

Natural Allies
I wonder if there is such a thing as natural allies, in terms of countries.


I remember when the Soviet Union was whole, and the cold war was going strong, I predicted that someday the United States and Russia would be allies. We’re not exactly there, but we’re closing the gap.


I based that prediction on the fact that some countries are natural allies, and eventually they realize it. For example, when two superpowers don’t share a border, and aren’t fighting for the same natural resources, and would benefit from trade, and have an interest in maintaining the world order, they are natural allies.


This theory is half-baked, I admit. I don’t have the historical knowledge to fill it out. Maybe you can help.


The idea is to come up with a set of criteria that reliably predicts whether two countries are natural allies. Once identified, those countries’ leaders have an argument for their own citizens as to why they should cease acting like enemies toward the other. This is important because two countries that have been at each other for decades will require their leaders to talk the citizens out of their animosity. The leaders will need something that looks like a grand philosophical reason. That’s what the theory of natural allies is.


The criteria for two countries being natural allies might look like this:


1. Do not share a border.
2. Are not trying to control the same limited natural resources.
3. Have significant trade potential.
4. Neither has a political philosophy that promotes conquest.
5. Both have an interest in a stable world order.


The beauty of this list is in what you choose to leave off. For example, it ignores religious differences, disputes with third party allies, nuclear ambitions, arming terrorists, and lots of things you would think should be addressed. NOT addressing them is the point. Let me explain.


Take Iran and the United States, for example. I would argue that the two countries meet the criteria for being natural allies. Despite all the bad history and differences, both countries have more to gain from cooperation than dispute. The problem is that a leader in either country could not remain in power if he or she promoted suddenly being nice to the other. The citizens wouldn’t allow it.


That’s where the theory of natural allies comes in. It’s a side door. You could hold a conference to address the theory of natural allies, as opposed to a conference to address the problems between two countries. Once both countries agree they are natural allies, which is an easier sell to their citizens than “let’s be friends,” the path is set to work toward more mutual interest.


Arguably, it’s nothing but a label. But we know that people’s brains are hugely influenced by labels. If your labels are The Great Satan and Axis of Evil, there isn’t much room for agreement. But if you agree that you are natural allies, based on the five criteria that are fairly objective in nature, you can get past the label problem.


I thought I’d try creating world peace one more time before the end of this year.

Work Pleasure
The other day I cleaned off the top of my desk. This involved sorting the rubble into mounds that had something in common, and then dealing with each mound. There were bills to pay, records to update, forms to be completed, faxes to be sent, licenses to approve, documents to file, tax issues to unscramble, and on and on.


When I was done, my desk was breathtakingly clear of debris. Gazing at my uncharacteristically pristine work space, a peculiar joy came over me. As I walked from my office back to my home, I felt lighter. There was a bounce to my step. I’m reasonably sure my body was creating extra endorphins.


It made me wonder if other people get an actual physical pleasure from doing work, at least the kind where you accomplish something, no matter how unimportant. My guess is that people who work long hours get a sort of charge every time they complete a discrete task. People who don’t get that charge, on average, probably find jobs where they can work fewer hours.


I recall my corporate days, where I would spend eight hours refining a Powerpoint presentation that, in all likelihood, would have no impact on the business. I always felt a charge of pleasure when it was done. Each time I reviewed the beauty and majesty of my graphs and bullet points, I would get a new little surge.


I think the pleasure of completed work is what makes blogging so popular. You have to believe most bloggers have few if any actual readers. The writers are in it for other reasons. Blogging is like work, but without coworkers thwarting you at every turn. All you get is the pleasure of a completed task.


Do you get pleasure from completing relatively unimportant tasks? And if so, do you work more than 40 hours per week, including optional work such as blogging?

There’s a Name for It
Last week, my in-laws were in town. While they were out visiting some other relatives, I took my turn watching their dog, Mollie. At this point, I should pause and mention that I haven’t had a dog since I was a kid. And in those days, in the country, when the dog felt nature’s call, we’d simply let the dog out, and it would use any part of our 2.5 acres as its toilet. Later, if you wanted to throw a ball around, you just kicked the (usually) frozen logettes to the side to clear a path. In those simple times, you weren’t playing a sport unless someone ended up covered in dog feces. It was just part of the game.


These days, things are quite different. Today, if you go to school covered in dog feces, there’s a stigma. And of course there’s the leash law. But nothing takes the joy out of a walk in the fresh air quite like being required to carry a plastic purse full of dog poop.


Back to my story, I took Mollie for a walk, thinking I understood how this process worked. The leash was no mystery. It had a cool spring action with a pistol grip. I liked that part. And I grabbed an official poop bag on the way out of the house. I was ready for anything.


Within a minute, Mollie laid down a steamer. I think she had been eating the cat food, because it wasn’t the firm little log I was expecting. But I soldiered on, turning the bag inside out like a glove, and grabbing the warm pile that melted in my hand. It wasn’t pleasant in the usual sense of the word, but I experienced some satisfaction in a job well done. I tied the bag into a tidy little package and intended to head home.


That’s when I noticed Mollie had just begun to poop. I don’t know if she was trying to spell “HELP” in case a rescue plane flew over, or what, but by now she was in full production. Step, squat, step, squat.
I looked at my tidy little bag, now sealed, and realized I was screwed. I knew the neighbors would be looking, or feared they might. I couldn’t leave this Katrina-sized disaster and get another bag lest someone think, incorrectly, that I had abandoned my doody. So I decided to see if I could untie the pooper bag and have another go at the new deposits. This plan did not work as smoothly as I had hoped.


Do you know what is NOT effective for picking up warm piles of poop? If you guessed “other warm piles of poop,” you might have been in this situation yourself. It was like trying to pick up mashed potatoes with a catcher’s mitt. And I was hurrying, so needless to say, back at the house I needed the Karen Silkwood treatment to feel clean again.


Later, when my in-laws returned, I told the story. Larry, a laid-back gentleman from Arkansas, turned to his wife Cheryl and drawled “Mollie double-bagged him.” Let me tell you, the only thing that could have made my experience worse was finding out my in-laws have a name for it.

Off the Grid
When I was researching green technology, I was disappointed to find out that no amount of solar panels can get you off the power grid. You also need a way to store the power for night use, and that technology is not yet economical or convenient.


There’s something cool about the thought of being totally off the power grid. It’s a psychological thing. I could rationalize being off the grid by saying it would come in handy if the rest of the world runs out of energy. But realistically, the big worry in that case wouldn’t be powering my iPod so much as not getting eaten by cannibals.


This week I saw some stories that reactivate my fantasy of being off the power grid for no practical reason whatsoever. First, you will soon be able to have your own nuclear reactor for your house.


http://www.nextenergynews.com/news1/next-energy-news-toshiba-micro-nuclear-12.17b.html


I don’t know about you, but I would look for ways to weaponize it. I’m sure they’ll say that isn’t possible, but I’d still try. I want nuclear superiority in my neighborhood.


There was also a recent breakthrough in battery technology. It will take a few years, but it looks as if you will be able to economically store your solar power after all, both for your home and your future electric car.


http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071219103105.htm


And the story wouldn’t be complete without a story about a solar panel company that can now get you energy cheaper than coal and is already shipping product.


http://www.celsias.com/2007/11/23/nanosolars-breakthrough-technology-solar-now-cheaper-than-coal/


I think these three technologies, if they all proved real, would provide the tipping point. Every new home would be energy self-sufficient, and all cars would be electric because you could charge them for free at home. Nothing new needs to be invented to make this happen.


Now please enjoy the brief period of optimism before you learn some reason this won’t all happen.

Man Fired For Posting Dilbert Comic
Some of you already saw this story. A man was fired for posting a Dilbert comic that suggested his management was a bunch of drunken lemurs.


http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071219/NEWS/712190360


Over the years, a number of people have approached me in public, or e-mailed me, to say they also got fired for posting Dilbert comics on walls. I don’t know how many of those stories, if any, are true.


If you intend to mock your boss with Dilbert comics, the trick is in knowing which comics to pick. Apparently there is a fine line between posting a comic that criticizes a particular policy decision, versus a comic that calls your boss an inebriated prosimian. (Thank you, Wikipedia.) 


In order to get his unemployment benefits, the perpetrator had to convince a judge that he was merely stupid, not intentionally misbehaving. He succeeded, but it’s not the sort of victory he should feel good about, as in “Yay! The judge agrees I’m an idiot! It’s going to be in the newspaper and all over the Internet!”


The moral of this story is that if you plan to circulate a Dilbert comic calling your boss a drunken lemur, the best way is to use your boss’s unattended computer to e-mail it to the entire company.

Inappropriate Reaction to News
Once again, I find myself having a socially inappropriate response to the news. This time it involves the two inmates who tunneled their way out of jail.


http://news.aol.com/story/_a/sexy-posters-used-in-daring-jailbreak/20071217165409990001


If all they had done was tunnel to freedom, I would have been impressed with their work ethic and creativity. But these guys took it one step further and left a note thanking a guard for helping them escape.


Pure evil genius.


I think everyone including the warden realizes it is highly unlikely the guard actually helped in the escape. But the authorities still have to look into it. At the very least, it made that guard consider that he might end up on the other side of the bars.


I know it is wrong to admire the creativity of criminals. But I blame them for doing such an admirable job of being evil.

Triple Entendre
Recently I wrote a series for Dilbert where Asok the intern dies, and is cloned back to life. But his DNA gets mixed up with a Snickers candy bar and he becomes half human, half snack. In the third panel of that comic, Asok awakes and asks, “Why do I feel nuts?”


http://dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20071208.html


I drew his arm in a way that would, I hoped, leave some humorous ambiguity about what type of nuts he was feeling. I expected that the comic would be banned in newspapers, and make an interesting anecdote for this blog. But apparently no one noticed the third possible interpretation of why a fellow with his hands under the sheets would feel nuts. I suppose it’s just as well.


You can’t get away with a double entendre in the comic pages, but apparently a triple entendre is safe.


Did you notice it?

Good Judgment
The December 17th issue of Time had some interesting statistics on voters. When asked the “most important quality” for a candidate, Democrats picked “good judgment” 33% of the time, and Republicans picked it 21%. The other choices were caring about people, leadership, character, and experience.


Does it bother you that good judgment wasn’t the top choice for three-quarters of all voters?


Obviously experience doesn’t help if you have bad judgment. But a person with good judgment would consult with people who have experience. Clearly, judgment is more important than experience.


Character is important in exactly the same sense that good health is important. You need a minimum of both to be a suitable president. But the bar isn’t set that high for either health or character. You can have polio, or be a liar, or a philanderer, and it doesn’t seem to have much impact on job performance. All of the current candidates have enough character, and enough health, for the job.


Leadership and caring about people are touchy-feely concepts that have little correlation with presidential job performance. Obviously you don’t want a wimp or a sociopath in the office, but again, the bar is set low. All of the current candidates clear it with room to spare.


Clearly, good judgment should be the most important quality in a president. But how often do you hear someone say that a candidate “has good judgment”? How about never?


I was thinking about this because someone forwarded me a link to a web site that is trying to draft Michael Bloomberg for president. http://www.uniteformike.com/. You would think the strongest quality a successful business person has to offer is good judgment. In most cases, if you start with a little money, and end up with a lot, you have to make a lot of good decisions along the way. But the site promoting Bloomberg doesn’t mention his decision-making skills because everyone knows voters aren’t influenced by that sort of thing.


Does that worry you?

The Ultimate Response
It will come as no surprise to my regular readers that I sometimes exhibit inappropriate responses in social situations. For example, when I hear about a tragedy, and there is something remotely funny about the event, that’s the part that gets my attention. If a guy dressed in a bunny outfit kills a forest ranger, I can’t focus on the tragedy part. In that sort of situation, I would probably let out an involuntary snort before noticing no one else is laughing. I’d try to play it off as a cough, but no one would buy it.


My biggest social problem, by far, is a habit of revealing my opinion with my first reaction, before I realize I should be keeping that opinion to myself. Some husbands, when asked a question by their wives, use the time-honored “What do YOU think, dear?” But wives don’t like that approach. It seems condescending. Worse yet, it does not leave you vulnerable to having the wrong opinion, so it has a killjoy element.


Last night, by accident, I discovered The Ultimate Response to topics in which you don’t yet know the right response. It happened when I was simultaneously brushing my teeth, and yawning, and responding to my wife. It came out something like this: “Ooo-aah-mumble-agh.”


My wife stopped, and looked at me, and said, “What does that reaction mean?”


Bingo. I had accidentally discovered a response that has neither a positive nor a negative connotation. For the rest of the evening, I used it for all of my responses, to great effect.


Shelly: “Do you want to watch 30 Rock?”


Me: “Ooo-aah-mumble-agh.”


Shelly: “I’d like to watch it.”


Me: “Hey, me too!”


Feel free to try my new noise at home, or in the office. You might have to practice until it has no trace of negative or positive vibe. Be careful not to go up in pitch toward the end, because that can be construed as optimism.


You’re welcome.

Urge to Simplify
No matter what I’m doing, I can’t help wondering if there is a better way. For example, I noticed yesterday in Las Vegas that many of the casinos have ATMs amongst thousands of slot machines. The casinos hopes you will take your money out of one machine, carry it several feet, and put it in another. There’s something about the change of ownership in your money that is considered entertainment.  And judging from the crowds, people can’t get enough of it.


In the old days, when Vegas was less popular, the slot machines sometimes gave a little of your money back, at least temporarily. But these days all the nice hotels are at full occupancy. I’ve been here three days and haven’t seen anyone win a jackpot. If you think that removing the “maybe you can win” part from the equation would dampen peoples’ enthusiasm, you have vastly overestimated the intelligence of the general public. After Las Vegas trained people to lose 98% of the time, it was a simple matter to nudge it to 100%.


Now the casinos have people trained, like chickens hoping for pellets, to take money from one machine (the ATM), carry it across a room and deposit in another machine (the slot machine). I believe B.F. Skinner would agree with me that there is room for even more efficiency: The ATM and the slot machine need to be the same machine.


The casinos lose a lot of money waiting for the portly gamblers with respiratory issues to waddle from the ATM to the slot machines. A better solution would be for the losers, euphemistically called “players,” to stand at the ATM and watch their funds be transferred to the hotel, while hoping to somehow “win.” The ATM could be redesigned to blink and make exciting sounds, so it seems less like robbery.


I’m sure this is in the five-year plan. Longer term, people will be trained to set up automatic transfers from their banks to the casinos. People will just fly to Vegas, wander around on the tarmac while the casino drains their bank accounts, then board the plane and fly home. The airlines are already in on this concept, and stopped feeding you sandwiches a while ago.

Lucky in Vegas
When I woke up yesterday morning, I had no idea that it would be the day I experienced the best lunch ever. Let me tell you, I have had many lunches. Some of them were darned good. But there can be only one Best Lunch Ever, and I’m sure I already had it. Allow me to set the stage.


I had just completed my speech to 2,000 technology professionals, and I had several hours to kill before my wife’s flight arrived. I decided to take a long walk and stop somewhere for a quick bite. After about 45 minutes of walking, I decided that my hunger and energy curves had crossed, and it was time to pick a pleasant eatery. As luck would have it, I was standing in front of a well-lit, new place that promised to have the variety of food a vegetarian requires. Lucky!


I walked up to the hostess stand and noticed an unusually large number of employees. There must have been thirty servers and only a handful of customers. Vegas was packed with people, yet I could sit wherever I wanted. Lucky!


One of the four hostesses acknowledged my presence, and I said in my most confident, non-loserish voice, “One for lunch.” But she balked, for reasons that were unclear. She looked to the taller hostess for guidance.  The tall one seemed to be some sort of manager. She said, “We’re a new restaurant, and not open to the general public yet. We’re just training the staff today. But if you want, you can eat here. The only catch is that it’s all free.” Lucky!


One of the smaller hostesses showed me to a seat at the bar. I noticed that no one was smoking in this restaurant – a rarity in Vegas. Lucky!


There were about eight bartenders for only four practice customers. The service was terrific. Lucky!


The menu was an abbreviated version, presumably for training reasons, but it had some excellent vegetarian choices. They were delicious. Lucky! And free. Lucky!


There you have it. That was the best lunch I ever had.


Oh, wait, I forgot one thing. The restaurant is the new Hawaiian Tropics restaurant. And all thirty of the servers looked like supermodels, wore bikinis, and acted extra nice to me because their managers were watching. That part was okay too.

What Happens in Vegas
I’m in Las Vegas this morning, to give a speech a to a few thousand technology workers. Last night, I did an AV check and tried to get back to my room without losing all the money in my wallet. I started optimistically, but it was all downhill after that.


The path to my room was cleverly littered with attractive slot machines. I don’t enjoy gambling, but I feel obligated to rationalize my decision to not be a Quaker. So I stuffed a twenty in a Wheel of Fortune slot machine and tapped a lighted button ten times while watching the 20 to turn into a 0. It took less than half a minute. I did a quick mental check, and no endorphins had kicked in, so I decided to call it a night.


By the time I got to my room, I was thirsty, and a nearby Coke machine beckoned. A Diet Coke would set me back $2.75. Somehow that seemed like a bargain. I couldn’t afford to go back to the casino and get free drinks. I stuffed a five into the slot and hit the button for Diet Coke. Jackpot!


When the machine pooped out that Diet Coke, I felt like a winner for the first time in Las Vegas. Granted, I was purchasing twelve cents worth of plastic and sugar water for $2.75, but I tried to not see it that way. Best yet, my change clanged down a chute like a cash payout.


But here’s the evil genius part. Instead of a cup-like receptacle for my change, the dispenser was designed more like a launcher. The coins hit the bottom and shot up and out of the machine. A quarter hit the ground and rolled under the Coke machine. That bastard! My Diet Coke just went to $3.00. Another coin, a shiny dollar featuring some Native American chick named Sasquatch, if I recall my history, hit the carpet and made a run down the hallway. That’s when I noticed that the carpet design was a bunch of round spots exactly the size and color of a Sasquatch coin. And suddenly my Diet Coke cost $4.00. Never have I seen such a well-conceived marriage of carpet and soda dispenser. Next year I’m bringing my metal detector.


I ordered room service because I couldn’t trust myself outside the room again.

Sleeping Skill
I can take a nap almost anywhere. When I travel, I’m often asleep before the flight takes off. I can even fall asleep in the dentist’s chair waiting for the Novacaine to kick in. At night, I’m asleep in about five minutes.


I wasn’t always that way. Falling asleep is a skill. I’ll tell you my method.


I always start by creating a simple story in my head where something good, and highly unlikely, happens to me. The trick is to focus on something that is more fascinating than your real life. Maybe you are winning a prestigious award, inventing something that changes the world, or being the first person on the scene of an accident involving the Cirque de Soleil and a tanker of chemicals that turn out to be a powerful aphrodisiac. The images should be more attractive than whatever bothersome thoughts would float into your head if you weren’t so busy fantasizing.


After a minute or two of that, I release all controlled thoughts and simply watch what floats by. When my eyes are closed, the part of my brain that interprets vision is apparently still active, because I can see all sorts of random objects drifting by, as if a mall exploded in space. I try to identify and name them as I see them.


Toaster…car…pencil…couch…snow blower, mitten, etc.


The next thing I know, I wake up.


That’s my method. What do you think about when you are trying to sleep?

Going Forward
I’ve decided to blog less. I posted daily (mostly) for two years, with the theory that my efforts would be compensated in four ways.


1. Advertising dollars
2. Compiling the best posts into a book.
3. Growing the audience for Dilbert
4. Artistic satisfaction.


Readership of The Dilbert Blog is growing rapidly, but at about the same rate people figure out how to use RSS feeds to get the content without the ads. So there’s no longer a correlation between how hard I work and the ad income I earn. It topped out at “trivial,” even while the audience grew to substantial.


My book based on the blog posts, STICK TO DRAWING COMICS, MONKEY-BRAIN! got great reviews for content, but angry reactions in people who feel that other people, who didn’t read the content on the Internet, and never will, should not buy the book, to protect the rights of the people who already read it on the Internet, and might want to read it again for free sometime. You win.


I hoped that people who loved the blog would spill over to people who read Dilbert, and make my flagship product stronger. Instead, I found that if I wrote nine highly popular posts, and one that a reader disagreed with, the reaction was inevitably “I can never read Dilbert again because of what you wrote in that one post.” Every blog post reduced my income, even if 90% of the readers loved it. And a startling number of readers couldn’t tell when I was serious or kidding, so most of the negative reactions were based on misperceptions.


Lastly, the blog has been a source of tremendous artistic satisfaction. I enjoyed being relatively uncensored, and interacting with the readers on fun topics. That’s why I will continue blogging, albeit less controversially. I’ll just do it less often, especially over the holidays. It’s hard to tell the family I can’t spend time with them because I need to create free content on the Internet that will lower our income.


Try www.reader.google.com to see blog posts without the ads.

Compulsive Gambler
Suppose you lived in a place with an unusually high population of compulsive gamblers, the type who will keep gambling until they are poor. And suppose you had the resources to open a casino. Would it be ethical to do so?


All the gamblers have a choice of resisting, assuming you subscribe to the superstition of free will. So you’re not hurting anyone by making it easier for them to go broke. You’re giving them new choices. And some of them might even win big jackpots.


This seems analogous to attending a concert for a struggling musician. The musician knows he will probably end up poor. He’s making his choice, and his addiction to the musician lifestyle is similar to a gambler’s addiction to gambling. By attending the live performance, you feed the musician's habit and make it less likely he will get a higher paying job as an insurance actuary.


You bastard.


Hey, it’s a holiday weekend, and I am not working too hard on these posts.

Results From Yesterday’s Post
Based on the highly unscientific sample of responses to yesterday’s post, free downloads of music appear to have a huge impact on creating an audience for unknown musicians.


The next logical question is how much money are those unknown musicians making? That’s not rhetorical. I wonder if they are making more or less than a typical cubicle job. I assume they play smaller venues, and don’t perform live as often as they want.


If I owned a venue for live music, and suddenly I had access to more musicians that could fill the smallish house, thanks to exposure on the Internet, I would pay them less than if only a few bands could bring in a crowd. It’s basic supply and demand.


In yesterday’s comments I saw the names of lots of bands I never heard of. Can anyone point to a link that would tell me whether or not they are making a decent living? Obviously they make enough to eat, but do they make more than a cubicle job with health benefits and a retirement plan?


It seems to me that economic forces would eventually drive the value of musicians – even good ones – down to a very low level, as long as lots of good musicians prefer playing live music to being in cubicles.


Are you doing a musician a favor by attending a live performance and postponing the day he will be inspired to get a real job with a health plan and start saving for his retirement?

Copyright Revisited
The emerging wisdom on file sharing of music is that successful musical artists don’t gain anything in terms of publicity, since they are already well known, and they lose in terms of album sales. While many citizens will happily pay a dollar to download a song, plenty will prefer free.


The benefit of file sharing to society, so it is argued, is that it allows unknown artists to become known without the backing of big corporate money. The musicians can then leverage that fame into lucrative live performances.


That’s the theory. How’s it working out?


What live musical performance have you attended in the past year because you heard the band’s music for free on the Internet?


How many musical performances have you attended in the past year that featured musicians who got famous the old-fashioned way?

What If?
On the local news last night there was a report on some research with marijuana and cancer. It turns out that the active ingredient in marijuana might stop cancer. The story seems to be an update to this one:


http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070417193338.htm


Add that information to a 2006 report that showed no connection between heavy marijuana smoking and lung cancer:


http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729_pf.html


Before I continue, let’s join hands and repeat “Medical stories in the media are always wrong…medical stories in the media are always wrong.” So this blog post is more of a “what if” sort of thing.


What if it turns out that smoking marijuana doesn’t cause cancer, and actually inhibits it better than anything you can buy in a baggie from a guy who has a suspicious rash?


I know, I know, the cancer-fighting component of marijuana probably needs to be administered in some concentrated form to be effective against cancer. So smoking marijuana, or eating it, probably wouldn’t work. But this is a “what if” post.


Now take a look at the “Fact Sheet” produced by a division of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse folks.


http://www.well.com/user/woa/fspot.htm


If the science around marijuana curing cancer were to become indisputable, and if smoking marijuana delivered the medicine, would they ever mention that in the fact sheet?


In other words, might the “fact sheet” ever be balanced for both the good and the bad?


Updated Marijuana Fact Sheet


1. Marijuana cures cancer.
2. Marijuana reduces stress.
3. Marijuana helps digestion.
4. Marijuana improves your sex life.
5. Marijuana is expensive, thanks to your government.
6. Marijuana is illegal, thanks to your government.
7. Marijuana will make kids lazier and stupider than usual.
8. Marijuana causes psychological dependence, similar to jogging.
9. Marijuana is expensive, similar to an iPhone.
10. Marijuana reduces the number of highway accidents.


That last one is just a guess based on the weasel-wording used by government groups to describe marijuana use and driving. I don’t know about you, but I’ve never heard of an accident caused by marijuana use alone. But I’ve heard of several accidents caused by people who WEREN’T gripping the steering wheel with both hands, focusing intently on the road, and driving 5 miles per hour under the speed limit.


NOTE TO KIDS: Don’t use marijuana. There are good reasons you aren’t allowed to do adult things such as vote, fornicate, or sign legal documents. Your brain isn’t developed enough to understand those reasons.


If science someday proves marijuana promotes good health and safety, would the government ever recommend it for adults?

Man Loves Bicycle
Did you see the story about a man arrested for having sex with a bicycle?


http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/10/26/nsex126.xml


I imagine the police interviewing him after his arrest. It probably went something like this:


Detective: Do you confess to having sex with a bicycle?


Bike Humper: Yes.


Detective: Was it a woman’s bicycle or a man’s bicycle?


Bike Humper: Dude, I’m not gay.


I have to wonder if the perpetrator is exclusively attracted to bicycles, or are other inanimate objects just as sexy? If so, I envy him on some level. There would be no such thing as a boring night at home. “Hellooooo, Lamp!”


He probably has his own set of private jokes he uses around the house: “Well, there’s nothing on TV tonight,” …pause for humorous effect…”except ME!”


If the perpetrator gets jail time, I would hate to be the other prisoner in his cell. I’d be afraid to fall asleep and appear inanimate for more than a minute. And I’d tape my toothbrush and tin cup to my chest. That would be a long five years.


My theory is that the perpetrator has a neighbor who keeps borrowing his shit, and this was his way of dealing with it. It almost worked. I’m practically certain no one will ask to borrow that bicycle. And his family will probably bury his bowling ball with him.


Or perhaps the man was too cheap to buy a bicycle lock and he was worried the cleaners would steal the bike. He had a choice of paying $12 for a lock, or humping the bike in front of them. Either way, the odds of bicycle theft plummeted. The thing he didn’t count on was the cleaners turning him over to authorities. I can see how he’d make that mistake. If you tell me you knew there was a law against loving your bicycle too much, you’re lying.


This story disturbs me on many levels. I was already concerned about becoming impotent from riding my bicycle. Now I’ll only ride my bicycle standing up, so no one will accuse me of teabagging it. I have enough problems.


[The joke I forgot to include: He would have done a unicycle, but his mother told him it would make him blind.]

CEOs Are Underpaid
From now on, I am only going to buy stock in companies that have the greatest disparity between the compensation of the CEO and the compensation of the workers. Thanks to a little thing I call science, this strategy looks like a winner. Yes, I will explain.


I came across two unrelated studies that I cleverly related. In one study, researchers found that happiness makes people successful.


http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/12/051219090811.htm


In another study, researchers found that sad workers are the most productive.


http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/06/010612065304.htm


To summarize the studies:


Happy = successful


Sad = productive


Now, if you were to describe the job of a CEO versus the job of a lower level worker, I think you might say the CEO needs to be successful (as opposed to productive) whereas the lower level worker needs to be productive (as opposed to successful). Ideally, everyone should be both successful and productive, but in terms of importance, you would prefer a successful CEO over one who has more meetings, or however else you would measure “productivity” in that job. And a factory worker, for example, needs to be productive more than he needs to “succeed,” if success even has meaning in that sort of job.


So it follows from the science that grossly overpaying a CEO makes good sense. It allows the CEO to be happy, which increases his odds of success, which is good for the stockholders. And best of all, overpaying a CEO makes the workers sad, which makes them more productive, which is also good for the stockholders.


You often see stories in the press about CEOs who are apparently overpaid. That used to annoy me. Now I realize the genius of it. Those overpaid CEOs are buying hookers and cocaine in a valiant effort to increase their happiness, and therefore their success, which lifts all boats. And by “all boats,” I mean the boats of everyone but the workers, who need to remain sad or the whole system breaks down.


If you would like to make your loved ones or coworkers more productive, try sending them the Amazon.com link to my new book with a note that says it is terrific and you read the entire thing on the Dilbert Blog while getting paid to allegedly work. Then toss in a "neener neener." That will make them a little bit sad, thus boosting their productivity.

Kick Me in the Virtual Nuts
Tomorrow night, October 30th, at 9 pm EST, you can log on to the virtual world called Second Life (for free), and have your avatar kick my avatar in the nuts. Or punch me, or slap me.


Seriously.


I took digital photos of my head from all angles and had it turned into a 3-D character, called an avatar. I’ll be on stage answering questions in a public forum in Second Life tomorrow night. Each person will have a chance to come on stage and literally kick my avatar in the nuts. Or punch me, or slap me, or any combination. Just push a button to select your method of assault. My avatar is programmed to react to the blows but won’t fight back.


Your own avatar can be selected from a bunch of options. So you could be, for example, a giant squirrel. And if your spouse asks you why you are late for dinner, just say, “I’m a giant squirrel, and I’m kicking that cartoonist guy in the nuts.” For once, it will be true.


My avatar is a bit creepy looking because it has my head but the body of a 19-year old marathon runner. You’ll want to beat me up as soon as you see me, just for being so creepy. And if you disagreed with anything I’ve ever said in this blog, you’ll have more than enough motivation to pound my nuggets into my thorax.


You can also get a free digital poster of Dilbert and Dogbert, suitable for displaying on your digital wall in Second Life.


This idea was born of the old marketing truism, “Your customers tell you what business you are in.” In my case, this blog has evolved to a forum where I say unpopular things and my readers abuse me in the comments. I’m just extending that to the virtual world where you can take out your frustration at my stubborn refusal to recognize the truth and beauty of your opinions, by kicking me in the ‘nads. This is what you call being customer focused. I think Nordstrom could learn a thing or two from my example.


You’ll have to download the free client software from Second Life before using the system. That’s here:


http://secondlife.com/community/downloads.php


After you have signed up and chosen an avatar, this link will take you to my event:


http://slurl.com/secondlife/Kula%204/248/250/32/?img=http%3A//www.aimeeweber.com/ScottAdamsSlurl.jpg&title=Scott%20Adams%20Virtual%20Book%20Tour


And if you can't think of a reason to kick me in the nuts, allow me to mention far too often that my new book is out, called Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey-Brain! Available at local bookstores or on Amazon.com at

Being spontaneous
One of the many flaws in my personality is that I am not spontaneous. I confess I am baffled by the entire concept.


First, how do you define spontaneity? Is it even a real thing, or just a superstition? Is spontaneity based on how far in advance you have an idea, or on how irrational the idea is, or some combination of the two?


If I think of doing something a week in advance, I know that’s not spontaneous. A day in advance probably doesn’t count either. I assume an hour isn’t enough. But how about, say, five minutes in advance? Is that still premeditated, or is it getting closer to being spontaneous?


Apparently there is something wrong with my brain, because I have this bad habit of knowing what I want to do before I do it. The phrase you are unlikely to hear from me is, “Why did I just do that?” If I see a cookie that looks tasty, I almost always know it will end up in my mouth before it happens. A truly spontaneous person, assuming such a creature exists, would often say, “What is this in my mouth? How did it get there?”


I have to think a spontaneous life is unsettling, and that’s just considering the stuff you discover in your mouth, to name one orifice.


As you know, you can fake most character traits if you need to. You can fake sincerity, kindness, compassion, optimism, and all sorts of things. But you can’t fake spontaneity. I know because I’ve tried, and it always comes out sounding crazy. I’ll blurt out something like “Let’s walk to Cuba,” and look at my wife to see if I nailed the spontaneous thing. So far, no luck. It’s an elusive concept.


I only know one group of people who are consistently spontaneous, and most of them are already in jail. The rest will follow. Women value spontaneity, so that probably explains why death row inmates get marriage proposals all the time. When you remove the part of a man’s mind that usually says, “Perhaps I should think about this before doing it,” that is pure hotness.


Speaking of hot, my new book, Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey-Brain! is a top five humor book on Amazon, if you subtract the books that are in the wrong category.


http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/4456/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_3/103-9776601-4063019


I wasn't planning to plug my book in this post, but it just happened. I think you will agree that's totally hot.

Now THAT’S a Party!
Did you read about the six beer-drinking elephants in India? The elephants found drums of fermenting rice beer on a farm, partied too hard, then uprooted utility poles and electrocuted themselves. The fascinating part is that because they are elephants, they still remember that night.


http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21432722/?GT1=10450


My first reaction to that story was, “I’ll have what they’re having!” You don’t get to use that joke often, and I don’t like to miss an opportunity.


I’m no marketing expert, but if I were the farmer whose beer they drank, I’d start calling it “Shocking Elephant” and I’d design the coolest beer bottles ever. They’d be in the shape of an elephant with his trunk straight out, and that’s the part you would drink from.


On the back label, I’d include a handy guide to what level of stupid you could expect after consuming each bottle. At the top of the scale, after ten bottles, you would have “probable accidental electrocution.” At the bottom of the scale, after drinking one elephant or two, the problems would be “Thinking you are witty” and “Mild attraction to your friend’s mom.”


As I understand it, when you get electrocuted, it makes you crap. Imagine being the first person to find these six dead elephants, in 40 tons of elephant poop, wrapped in live power cables. I would dive into the bushes and hope no one saw me. My fear would be that my neighbor who owns the land might say, “Can you help me clean this up?”


They say there’s a tool for everything, but I checked my toolkit, and there’s nothing there for cleaning up six electrocuted elephants in a mountain of shit. How do you even approach this problem? Do you wait for them to harden, then cut them up with chainsaws, put them in plastic garbage bags and distribute them to dumpsters all over town?


In the short run, you could charge admission to see the six dead elephants. I’d pay a rupee or two for that. I might even take the kids. There aren’t many things the whole family can enjoy, but I’m pretty sure this is one of them.


Perhaps this is why I’m not in charge of planning weekends.


Speaking of dead elephants rotting in piles of crap, my new book is a perfect gift for the person in your life who knows how to read and can’t stop bragging about it. You can get the book at Amazon or any local bookstore. On Amazon, it's the #1 best selling humor book about business, even though it's not about business.

David Cop a Feel
Did you see in the news that a woman has accused famous magician David Copperfield of sexual assault?


http://openbanter.com/showpost.php?id=621


If he’s innocent, I would like to be David Copperfield’s defense lawyer. I would argue that my client doesn’t need to assault women because he knows magic. When he wants some action, all he has to do is make a willing woman materialize. The judge would admonish me for not being serious, at which point I would do a theatrical turn toward my client and say, “BEHOLD!” In a prearranged move, Copperfield would pull a blanket from his sleeve, drape it over the defense table, wave his arms, and a pair of feet would appear under the table, high heels facing the judge. Then my client would lean his head back and start moaning.


The judge would start banging his gavel, (so to speak), and I would turn to the jury and yell, “I REST MY CASE!”


If that didn’t work, I’d put the accuser on the stand and ask, “How can you be so sure my client touched you?” As she answered the question, I would nod to my magician client and have him do the trick where his hand comes out of my zipper and waves hello. Then I would say in my most sarcastic voice, “SO, TELL US AGAIN HOW GOOD ARE YOU AT KNOWING WHERE MY CLIENT’S HANDS ARE.”


Then I would ask the bailiff to bring me the Bible on which the accuser swore an oath. I would ask the accuser to read any passage aloud. By then, my magician client would have pulled the switcheroo, and the accuser would be reading something from Mein Kampf. I would turn to the jury and say, “That’s not the Jesus I know!”


I haven’t heard what evidence the prosecution will present, but for the sake of this blog, let’s hope it involves a semen-stained dress. When the police officer shows the court this piece of evidence, I would ask him if there was any way my client’s DNA could be on that dress without sex. The police officer would say sex was the only explanation. Then I would ask the bailiff to turn down the lights. I would signal to my client to do his magic, then take out a black light and show that the policeman’s own uniform is covered with my client’s semen, and not just a little. He’d look like the Pillsbury Dough Boy exploded on him.


I only joke about this because I think it’s unlikely the alleged crime happened. But if it turns out that the handsome, famous, charismatic magician who earns over $40 million a year and dates supermodels is forcing himself on women, I support the death penalty. And that’s only partly because watching him try to escape from the gas chamber after he’s strapped down would be good TV.

Hiring Republicans
I put a question on Predictify.com asking how many of my new book would be in print by the end of January. The average of the predictions is over 304,000. http://www.predictify.com/AuctionView.aspx?ID=176


As the creator of the question, I get special rights to look at the demographics of the predictors to see what kind of correlations there are. I noticed there isn’t much difference in the predictions by religion or gender or level of education and so on. But two categories jumped out.


Notice the difference in average predictions by political affiliation:


Republicans:  352,000
Democrats:    286,000
Independents: 275,000


Are Republicans more optimistic than Democrats, and are they projecting that optimism on my book? That’s my hypothesis. And it tracks with the fact that independents have the lowest predictions. I think the cynics and pessimists are the people least likely to be part of an organized movement.


The other big difference in predictions was by employment:


Students:   325,000
Employed:   295,000
Unemployed: 164,000


Those predictions also track with what I imagine is the level of optimism for those demographic groups. Students are idealistic and don’t appreciate how hard the real world is going to be. They are optimists. People with jobs are likely to be far more optimistic than unemployed people.


Hypothetically, suppose researchers confirmed that Republicans are the most optimistic people by nature. Since optimism is an important contributor to success, if you were trying to fill a position in your company, would it make economic sense to favor Republicans, even if you held a different political view?


Speaking of my book, Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey-Brain!, that I am shamelessly plugging all week, here’s a link to Amazon, or you can get it in your local bookstore. (I gave you two posts today to compensate for my inexcusable capitalism.)

Why You Can’t Take Me Anywhere
Last night I attended a meeting at our local school. It was part of a larger program put on by the police to teach parents how to prevent their kids from using drugs when they get older.


My personal objective was to make it through the night without making any inappropriate jokes that would embarrass my wife. It was a narrow escape.


Let me tell you, there are some situations where it is physically painful to be me. There was one point in the program where I think I ruptured a spleen trying to keep the jokes in. It came during the module on methamphetamines.


A parent asked why anyone would take meth, given all the downside risk and side effects. One of the policemen answered that meth releases 50 times more serotonin in the brain than an orgasm. Then they showed a before and after picture that looked a lot like this one:


http://www.drugfree.org/Portal/DrugIssue/MethResources/faces/photo_8.html


So I’m sitting there, doing the calculations in my head: Okay, that’s 4.5 years of meth use, once a day, 365 days in a year, 50 times more serotonin than an orgasm…that’s the equivalent of 80,000 orgasms.


On the downside, your teeth rot out, your skin itches until you scratch it off, you vomit, have withdrawals, possibly burn down the neighborhood, and roll around in your own filth while your life becomes a living Hell. And there is the jail thing.


Still, 80,000 orgasms…


I wanted to raise my hand while the “before and after” pictures were up and ask, “Isn’t that what anyone would look like after 80,000 orgasms?”


Or maybe, “So, on balance, you’re saying it’s totally worth it? Or am I doing the math wrong?”


But I didn’t. I listened for two and a half hours and tried my best to avoid looking like I had any of the telltale symptoms of hardcore addiction the policemen kept describing. I’m highly suggestible, so this was difficult. When they talked about the uncontrollable fidgeting, I realized I was fidgeting. When they talked about red eyes, I felt as if all the moisture in mine had evaporated. When they talked about the teeth grinding, I had an uncontrollable impulse to grind mine. I took deep breaths and tried to meditate so my pulse wouldn’t be too high – a sure sign of ecstacy use. I don’t think I was alone. The audience looked like a warehouse of mannequins by the end of the night. No one wanted to be a conspicuous fidgeter.


Then there was the bad guessing. The policeman would hold up a bag of one sort of drug or another and ask if anyone knew how much it would cost. No one wanted to nail the estimate on the first guess and have the drug dogs tearing out the upholstery in their minivan five minutes later. I was planning my own bad estimates in case I got called on. It would have gone something like this: “That looks like about a pound of cocaine, so I’m guessing it would be worth nine or ten dollars on the street. Am I close?”


I managed to get through the night without embarrassing myself, and without getting strip searched. I even got a free cookie, which spiked my blood glucose level and gave me a mild high, but I couldn’t enjoy it.

Monkey Attack
You can only imagine how many people forwarded me the story about a gang of monkeys attacking and killing the deputy mayor of Delhi, in India. Apparently this had “my kind of story” written all over it.


http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7055625.stm


According to the BBC, devout Hindus think monkeys are the manifestation of the monkey god Hanuman. Allow me to digress right here and confess that I could type the words “monkey god” all day long, and doing so would make me happy each and every time. For some wonderful reason, that combination of words – monkey god – releases a little snort of serotonin directly into the part of my brain that likes it the most.


Monkey god...monkey god...monkey god...Aaaaah, that’s what I’m talkin’ about.


Anyway, devout Hindus often feed nuts and bananas to the monkeys. So it should come as no surprise that monkeys will occasionally jump on your balcony, grab your nuts, and try to get their paws on your banana. This is why the phrase “had it coming” was invented.


The Indian solution to the problem involves training large monkeys to beat up the small ones. This can’t end well. In my country, we complain that defense contractors are drumming up reasons for war. In India, it looks like the monkey training industry is getting too influential. Their solution to every problem is larger monkeys. But you need to breed ever larger monkeys to beat up the previous monkeys. That’s all well and good until one of them climbs to the top of the Taj Mahal and starts swatting jets.


If I were invited to the funeral, or whatever they call it in India, and I was not a close friend or relative, I don’t know if I could behave myself. Let’s say I was the deputy mayor’s driver, and I was friendly with the dearly departed, but not friends. I think I would spend the entire ceremony going up to different family members and asking, “So, how did he die? No one mentioned it yet.” My entire objective would be to trick a great aunt into saying, “The monkeys tried to grab his nuts, but he didn’t have enough nuts to go around. A scuffle broke out, and he went over a railing.”


I don’t know how reincarnation works, but I’m guessing the deputy mayor will come back as a monkey hater. He might not be too fond of me either.


In unrelated news, my new book, based on the funnier posts from my blog, is available in local bookstores and on Amazon at...

IT'S A BOOK!!! IT'S A CONTEST!!!
Did you notice that the The Dilbert Blog archive suspiciously disappeared last spring? A big publisher agreed with your frequent suggestions that I should turn the funnier posts into a book. So I did, and as part of that deal removed the book content from the Internet.


The book’s title is inspired by the many insults hurled at me on this blog. It’s called STICK TO DRAWING COMICS, MONKEY-BRAIN! And it hits stores today.


Now, you might wonder what would inspire you to read a book full of funny noodlings that you might have seen on this blog. Answer: It makes a lovely gift for the people in your life who are seriously twisted and don’t read blogs. You might know someone in that category.


If you plan to snag a copy of the book, it helps me the most if you do it this week, so it picks up momentum. Here’s the Amazon link, or visit your local book seller.


http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591841852?ie=UTF8&tag=
dilbertcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325
&creativeASIN=1591841852


My only book signing will be at my restaurant, Stacey’s at Waterford, on November 7th from 5 to 7 p.m., facilitated by Barnes & Noble. See www.eatatstaceys.com and click “events.”


BOOK BLURB CONTEST
==================


You know those personal endorsements you see on the back cover of books? Those are called “blurbs.” You can win valuable prizes, and maybe see your blurb on the back of my book after the next printing, by entering the STICK TO DRAWING COMICS, MONKEY-BRAIN! book blurb contest right here.


(U.S. Residents only. Sorry! The book is only available in the U.S. for now too. More countries will follow.)


The detailed contest rules are below. Just submit a humorously over-the-top book blurb in the comments to this blog post. (Don’t worry that you have never seen the book.)


The top winner gets a framed original Dilbert strip worth $1,500, and your blurb might appear on the back cover of the book after the next print run. Twenty-five runners up get signed copies of the book, with a little sketch of Dogbert on the inside.


An example of a funny book blurb would go something like this: “I laughed so hard, one of my kidneys shook loose and I pooped it out. I can’t wait for the sequel!”


Or “My acne cleared up, and I threw away the Viagra!”


Or “I was illiterate until I heard about this book. Finally there was a reason to read!”


You get the idea. The wilder the better.

Proof of God
When you publish your e-mail address, you hear from a lot of interesting people. Some time ago I got a message from a guy who said something about having a four-sentence proof of God. I must have replied that I’d like to see it. Anyway, he sent it. I deleted the message months ago, but I keep getting reminded of the proof. It went something like this:


Proof of God


1. It is impossible for one person to see reality through the eyes of another.


2. By definition, a reality you can’t enter via any form of transportation is another dimension.


3. You comprise 100% of your dimension, because no one else can share exactly your perception.


4. If you are the entire universe within your dimension, you are God by definition, since you are everything within your own dimension.


Then he said that other people are really your perception of other dimensions, or Gods. You can see a representation of the other Gods, looking like people, but you can never experience their reality.


He went on to explain that if I send a message from my universe to yours, it always gets scrambled along the way. Sometimes it is mildly distorted, and sometimes entirely altered, as you’ve seen in my recent posts, but it is never exact.


How could you test this theory to see if it’s true? For one thing, you could verify that most messages you send out are misunderstood by the recipient. (Check) And there’s no doubt that no one sees reality the way you personally experience it, and never can. (Check)


Another thing you might look for is the number of non-interfering experiences. By that I mean, how many times is your perception of something completely different from everyone else’s perception, and the contradiction is never noticed? For example, if you and I see a dog in the park, and I come away remembering it as brown, and you remember it as white, it makes no difference if we never discuss that dog for the rest of our lives.


99.999% of what you experience is never verified with anyone else’s experience.  And that’s not even counting the times you are asleep. Only occasionally do our perceptions collide. Have you ever heard a friend (another God) tell a story in which you participated, only to think “It didn’t happen that way”? That’s because all memories are personal, and to a large extent manufactured. Your reality is truly your own.


So according to “some guy on the Internet,” you are a god.

Cognitive Dissonance (or not) Update
After my recent post on Bill Maher’s show Real Time, and his interview with the author of the book “Cool It,” Bjorn Lomborg, I got a lot of interesting reactions. But first, some corrections.


I referred to Lomborg as an economist because that’s how he was introduced on Real Time. Apparently he’s famous for organizing economists to get their views, he’s got a background in statistics, and he was Director of Denmark’s Environmental Assessment Institute. But he’s not an economist. He’s more like a guy who organizes experts, gathers their views, and develops a point of view from that. If an informed opinion requires input from multiple fields, say science, economics, statistics, and alternative energy, no one can be a complete expert without mastering all of those fields. I don’t know if such a person exists.


Also, many of you pointed out that my example of cognitive dissonance wasn’t so much cognitive dissonance as one of many other possible labels. Some of you are probably right. But I don’t know which ones, and cognitive dissonance seems to me like a close enough diagnosis, so I’ll keep using it.


But here’s the most interesting part. My blog on how Bill Maher and his panelists misunderstood Lomborg has caused a new round of cognitive dissonance. I have now been labeled a supporter of Lomborg’s arguments simply because I said I understood what he said on a TV show. Check this out. It’s somewhat jaw-dropping:


http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/9/28/21480/1840


I always wondered why Al Gore never defended himself from the attack “He said he invented the Internet.” What he did is get funding for the Internet before most people had even heard of it. I thought he could have easily turned the attacks into a positive with something like, “I never used the word ‘invent,’ but I did play a big role in funding the creation of the Internet before anyone else in Congress saw its potential. That’s the sort of vision you need in a president.”


But he didn’t take that path. He rolled over and took a beating. Now I understand why. Once a misunderstanding gets out of the bottle, there is no fixing it. He didn’t have a chance. I think he knew it.

Almost as Funny as a Turd
Yesterday I asked you to suggest a punch line for a Dilbert comic that was better than “Sometimes the best you can do is move the turd to another pocket.” I promised I’d tell you what I had come up with on my own, so you can compare your entries to mine.


Here’s mine: “Sometimes the best you can do is move the hairball to another pocket.”


It’s not nearly as funny as turd. But it can get published. Did anyone top it?


September 29, 2007 in General Nonsense | Permalink | Comments (130)


Turd is the Word
Being a syndicated cartoonist isn’t as glamorous as people imagine. For example, the other day I spent about an hour trying to come up with a word as funny as turd. Ultimately, I failed.


It all started with a comic I drew with this third panel. (Click to enlarge.)


071127_turd_pocket


This comic has at least two problems. One is that it uses a word I can’t get published. The other is that the boss’s line is so perfect I can’t convince myself it is original. Did I read or hear that line someplace in the past? It sure sounds like something someone would have already said. Google came up empty, but it might be something that a colorful person from my past used to say.


Intuitively, I knew there was no other word in the universe that would be as funny as turd. Even other words that mean the same as turd would fall short, and be equally impossible to publish.


Eventually I came up with a replacement word, and that’s what will run in a month or so. It’s not nearly as funny as turd, but it was the best I could do. I wonder if you can top it. Let’s see.


I’ll give you a little wiggle room. There are two rules for your submission:


1. Keep the boss’s first words, “Sometimes the best you can do…”
2. Complete the sentence with a funny expression of utter futility.


If I like your suggestion better than my own, and it’s not filthy, I might use it. I’ll tell you mine tomorrow, so it doesn’t get in your head and make this harder today.


I know some of you are already thinking about “arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.” That won’t be a winner.

On the Other Hand
Anything you learn changes your brain. That’s the point of learning. And different types of learning strengthen different parts of your brain. For example, learning math changes your brain in a different way from learning art, or learning to juggle.


I studied economics in college. One thing I’ve noticed is that other people who have studied economics tend to think a similar way. Some of the similarity is probably because it takes a certain kind of person to be interested in economics in the first place. But I’m convinced that the study of economics changes brains in a way I can identify after about five minutes of conversation. In particular, I think the study of economics makes you relatively immune to cognitive dissonance.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance


The primary skill of an economist is identifying all of the explanations for various phenomena. Cognitive dissonance is, at its core, the inability to recognize and accept other explanations. I’m oversimplifying, but you get the point. The more your brain is trained for economics, the less it is susceptible to cognitive dissonance, or so it seems.


The joke about economists is that they are always using the phrase “On the other hand.” Economists are trained to recognize all sides of an argument. That seems like an easy and obvious skill, but in my experience, the general population lacks that skill. Once people take a side, they interpret any argument on the other side as absurd. In other words, they are relatively susceptible to cognitive dissonance.


Recently I saw the best case of cognitive dissonance I have ever seen. It was on Bill Maher's show, Real Time, which I love. Bill was interviewing Danish economist Bjorn Lomborg, who has a book about global warming, called "Cool It." The economist made the following points clearly and succinctly:


1. Global warming is real, and people are a major cause.


2. When considering the problems that global warming will cause, we shouldn't ignore the benefits of global warming, such as fewer deaths from cold. 


3. The oceans rose a foot in the last hundred years, and the world adapted, so the additional rise from global warming might not be as big a problem as people assume.


4. Developing economical fossil fuel alternatives is the only rational solution to global warming because countries such as China and India will use the cheapest fuel, period. If only the developed countries who can afford alternatives change their ways, it’s not enough to make a dent in the problem.


The Danish economist’s argument doesn't fall into the established views about global warming. He wasn't denying it is happening, or denying humans are a major cause. But he also wasn’t saying we should drive hybrid cars, since he thinks it won’t be enough to help. He thinks we need to make solar (or other alternatives) more economical. That’s the magic bullet. His views don’t map to either popular camp on this issue, and it created a fascinating cognitive dissonance in Bill Maher (a fan of hybrid cars) and his panelists. Here are their reactions after the interview:


Rob Thomas said the interview "...confused the shit out of me." (Yet the economist was completely clear and communicated well.)


Salman Rushdie said, jokingly, that what he heard was "There's no connection between smoking and lung cancer." By that he meant the author was denying that fossil fuels contribute to global warming. (The economist said exactly the opposite, and clearly.)


Bill Maher said, "...20 years later, this guy is going to say, 'You know what? Yeah, there is global warming." (The economist already said exactly that during the interview. In fact, his entire book is based on global warming being true and hastened by fossil fuels.)


You can see the full transcript for yourself here. The interview is about 60% into the show.


http://billmaher.com/?page_id=209


Bill Maher is a brilliant guy, whether you agree with his views or not. Salman Rushdie is brilliant too. I don’t know about Rob Thomas, but he looks bright enough. Why couldn’t these three people hear anything the economist was saying? It looks to me like a classic case of cognitive dissonance . They literally couldn’t recognize that the economist was on their side because he suggested considering both the positive and negative effects of global warming.


I know I harp on this topic too much. But I do think that understanding cognitive dissonance, especially when it happens to you, is the only way to understand the world.


You can see this phenomenon on this blog on a regular basis. If I say Iran has a legitimate economic reason for building nuclear reactors, because experts agree Iran is running out of oil, it will be interpreted as anti-semetic. If I say the evidence for evolution that is available to me personally, as a non-expert, looks sketchy, it is interpreted as an argument for creationism.


In summary, if you ever plan to use the phrase “on the other hand,” be sure to wear your Kevlar underpants.

Homo Erectus
I was reading an article about the little hobbit-like creatures discovered in Indonesia. I couldn’t help notice that the article uses the abbreviation “H. Erectus” instead of the full name Homo Erectus. This is presumably to prevent jokes about why we don’t see any of them around these days.


http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1230409.htm


I’m crossing my fingers that someday scientists will discover one of these hobbit carcasses encased in amber or whatever-the-hell would allow us to snatch some DNA and clone them. Since they aren’t human, I think cloning would be legal. And although they have heads the size of grapefruits, scientists believe they were smart enough to use tools and hunt tiny elephants. That spells one thing: Hobbit butlers.


I want to be able to order a hobbit butler from a magazine and have it delivered in a box with air holes. My hobbit butler would always wear a tiny tuxedo, mostly for the cuteness. I’d call him Max, because of the irony factor, since he would be so tiny.


Max wouldn’t be bright enough to install a new computer network, or big enough to drive a car, so his utility would be limited. But he’d be perfect for playing ring toss. I’d have him stand at attention on the other side of the room and train him to yell funny things when I got a ring over him, such as “You are the best ring tosser of all times, you magnificent and gigantic bastard!” Best of all, he could pick up the rings and bring them back. If you think I would ever get tired of that, you don’t know me.


For Halloween, I’d get Max a winged monkey costume and dress up as the Wicked Witch. You can’t tell me that wouldn’t win some sort of prize. And I’d make him knock on doors and get candy. He’d clean up.


I might also get a dog so Max could ride it like a horse. When I wanted a Diet Coke from the fridge, Max would ride the dog to the kitchen and get it. Would I ever get tired of that? Not likely.


I’d never have to find the remote control again, because I would use Velcro to attach it to Max’s head. When I wanted to watch TV, I would just whistle and he’d run over and face the TV.


I’m sure there are more uses for a hobbit butler, but none come to mind. What would YOU do with a three-foot tall Homo?

Yesterday, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad went to Columbia University and asked Israel to bomb his country. At least that’s how it sounded to me. Meanwhile, the President of Columbia hurled personal insults at the leader of a soon-to-be-nuclear power and strengthened their reasons for wanting us dead. I wonder if those guys had tense conversations with their wives later that night.


Wife: “Mahmoud, you flaming elf turd, did you just give our enemies political cover to annihilate our country?”


Amadinejad: “Okay, so sometimes I say the wrong thing at the wrong time. Big deal. How about coming over here and giving me some scarf.”


And who was the smartest person involved in yesterday’s events? George Bush. Criticize him all you want, but sometimes even a blind squirrel finds a nut. He shrugged off the whole controversy about Ahmadinejad’s visit to Columbia and let the Iranian President shoot himself in the foot. Well played.


The most entertaining part of Ahmadinejad’s speech is trying to figure out what the Hell is happening in his tiny bearded skull. The things he says that sound crazy, stupid, or ignorant can also be interpreted as routine political talk. In this country, we expect our politicians to say whatever plays well with voters, no matter how preposterous. You can never be sure what professional liars are thinking. So here are my best guesses about Ahmadinejad.


1. Ahmadinejad said Iran doesn’t have gay people. There is zero chance he believes that. He just wanted to change the subject. I interpret that as acknowledgment that Iran is executing homosexuals. (I don’t approve of that, in case you wondered.)


2. Ahmadinejad acknowledged that the holocaust happened, but thinks it is unfair that the holocaust skeptics in Europe are prosecuted whereas skeptics on other issues are not. I believe that’s his true opinion now, whether or not he was a holocaust denier in the past. If he didn’t believe the holocaust happened, he’d have no reason to stop denying it now while he’s openly skeptical about the cause of 9-11.


3. I think Ahmadinejad is genuinely skeptical that Bin Laden accomplished 9-11 all by himself. I don’t think it’s crazy to ask whether some dark forces in the U.S. and Israel had the means and the warped motive to help with the logistics, even if only in some small support way. Ahmadinejad lives in a country whose government was once overthrown by the U.S., so I can understand him being genuinely skeptical. And it plays well back home.


4. Ahmadinejad didn’t respond directly to questions about wanting Israel wiped off the map. But he said Iran isn’t building nuclear weapons and has no need for them. In other words, he ruled out nuking Israel. I believe the leadership in Iran isn’t collectively crazy enough to nuke Israel. And I don’t think Ahmadinejad knows of any other realistic way to wipe Israel off the map. It sounds like politics and wishful thinking to me.


5. I think Ahmadinejad is lying when he says Iran isn’t building nuclear weapons. They have the means and the motive (defense). It’s in their best interest to have nukes, and they always have the option to give them up, and allow inspectors, if America masses troops on the border.


While I think it’s highly unlikely that Iran would ever nuke Israel, either directly or by proxy, the odds are not zero. In my opinion, Ahmadinejad’s speech at Columbia, plus Iran’s support for Hezbollah give Israel a legitimate reason to attack Iran in self defense. I think Ahmadinejad knows that, and is taking a calculated risk that any attack on Iran would be limited in nature and cause Israel to lose international support.


Likewise, Ahmadinejad didn't deny Iran is helping Iraqi insurgents kill Americans. That's a legitimate reason for the United States to support an attack on Iran. It's a separate question as to whether an attack on Iran is in America's best interest.


I wasn’t planning to blog on this topic, but my hit count went through the roof yesterday thanks to the various groups mustering their forces of darkness to misinterpret what I wrote and screech at me. (Thank you!)

What Qualifies as a Mental Problem?
This post will come off sounding argumentative, but I don’t intend it that way. It’s based on a genuine curiosity. After reading the comments to my posts for the past few days, it’s clear that people fall into some interesting categories. This made me wonder who gets to decide when a certain way of thinking qualifies as a genuine mental problem.


For example, as many of you noted about your fellow posters, a common way of thinking goes like this:


“If you think Jack the Ripper was a doctor in his day job, and you think doctors are positive role models, you must support Jack Ripper and celebrate the killing of women. Die, you woman-hater!”


Is that a form of mental problem, or does the fact that it describes how the majority of the population forms political opinions make it good mental health by definition? That’s a serious question.


Suppose we give this way of thinking a name. Let’s call it ripperitis. Sometimes labeling things is enough to change how we deal with them. Perhaps having a name for the condition will allow scientists to get funding to find a cure. I hope so, because it would give me something new to say to end political debates.


“Well, Bob, based on your rant, I’d say you have a bad case of ripperitis. I hear they’re working on a pill that lets people like you appreciate the complexity of arguments.”


And then Bob would say, “If you think drugs are such a great idea, why don’t you go marry a cocaine dealer in a civil union?”

Sorry I Confused You
In reading the comments to my post yesterday, I see that many of you were confused about my positions. Evidently all of you are brilliant, so I assume the problem is on my end. With your indulgence, allow me to clarify.


1. I am not happy that Hitler killed your relatives.
2. I do not support the killing of Americans
3. I do not support nuclear annihilation of Israel
4. I do not support the stoning of virgins in Iran
5. I believe the holocaust happened


I also don’t argue there’s a moral equivalence between Iran and the United States, or Israel and the Palestinians, or anyone and anyone else. Groups pursue their own perceived self interest. Arguing relative morality is an idiot’s game. Pointing out similarities in policies, and shaking the box, is good clean fun.


Next, I believe that if Iran is in fact helping Iraqi insurgents harm Americans, it’s an act of war, and a legitimate reason for attacking Iran in some fashion. That doesn’t mean it’s in the best interests of the United States to do so, but I would view it as legitimate.


Likewise, if the Iranians really are developing a nuclear weapon with the intent of using it on Israel, and there was some way to confirm that other than suspicious translations of speeches, then attacking Iran makes perfect sense, and I would support it completely. My problem is that I keep seeing patterns:


1. Iraq is helping Al-Qaeda
2. Iraq has weapons of mass destruction
3. Al-Qaeda is operationally non-functional
4. The surge is working
5. Iran is helping Iraqi insurgents kill Americans


I believe there’s a good chance Iran is helping Iraqi insurgents kill Americans, simply because it might be in their perceived best interest to do that. But I’d be an idiot to believe it simply because the government told the media it was true and the media told me. You can only fool me five or six dozen times before I start getting suspicious.


I think Iran would be foolish to let matters in Iraq unfold without trying to influence it. It’s in their best interest to meddle. That doesn’t mean I support it. I prefer they didn’t. But it’s not a realistic option. I presume the dark forces on our side are making sure any Iranian offenses are being met with consequences, and I’m all for that.


I also support Israel’s actions in pursuit of its self-interest. I’d be a hypocrite to do otherwise, since I also support the United States, despite what it did to the Native Americans a few hundred years ago. At some point you have to release on the past and accept the present realities. Israel won. It isn’t going anywhere.


If Israel had an enemy that it could make peace with, then I might feel different. But it doesn’t, so Israel’s best interests dictate keeping the neighbors too economically weak to purchase expensive weapons, and to control as much territory as possible. I don’t begrudge any country that makes rational decisions in support of its own safety. I don’t even begrudge Israel’s influence on American foreign policy. I respect them for how well they do it.


Still, the bulk of my sympathies are with whatever group suffers the most, regardless of how much of the problem is their own damned fault. To feel otherwise would be inhuman. Sometimes it feels as if the Palestinians are only one Gandhi away from fixing their problems. But he’d need to be bulletproof.


Here’s your hypothetical question of the day: If it ever happened that America attacked Iran because of alleged nukes, and later confirmed it had no nuclear weapons program, and we discovered that the administration knew it all along, would it be in the best interest of the citizens of the United States to overthrow their government?

A Feeling I'm Being Had
I was happy to hear that NYC didn't allow Iranian President Ahmadinejad
to place a wreath at the WTC site. And I was happy that Columbia
University is rescinding the offer to let him speak. If you let a guy like
that express his views, before long the entire world will want freedom
of speech.


I hate Ahmadinejad for all the same reasons you do. For one thing, he
said he wants to "wipe Israel off the map." Scholars tell us the correct
translation is more along the lines of wanting a change in Israel's
government toward something more democratic, with less gerrymandering.
What an ass-muncher!


Ahmadinejad also called the holocaust a "myth." Fuck him! A myth is
something a society uses to frame their understanding of their world, and
act accordingly. It's not as if the world created a whole new country
because of holocaust guilt and gives it a free pass no matter what it
does. That's Iranian crazy talk. Ahmadinejad can blow me. 


Most insulting is the fact that "myth" implies the holocaust didn't
happen. Fuck him for saying that! He also says he won't dispute the
historical claims of European scientists. That is obviously the opposite of
saying the holocaust didn't happen, which I assume is his way of
confusing me. God-damned fucker. 


Furthermore, why does an Iranian guy give a speech in his own language
except for using the English word "myth"? Aren't there any Iranian
words for saying a set of historical facts has achieved an unhealthy level
of influence on a specific set of decisions in the present? He's just
being an asshole.


Ahmadinejad believes his role is to pave the way for the coming of the
Twelfth Imam. That's a primitive apocalyptic belief! I thank Jesus I do
not live in a country led by a man who believes in that sort of
bullshit. Imagine how dangerous that would be, especially if that man had the
launch codes for nuclear weapons. 


The worst of the worst is that Ahmadinejad's country is helping the
Iraqis kill American soldiers. If Iran ever invades Canada, I think we'd
agree the best course of action for the United States is to be
constructive and let things sort themselves out. Otherwise we'd be just as evil
as the Iranians. Those fuckers.


Those Iranians need to learn from the American example. In this
country, if the clear majority of the public opposes the continuation of a war, our
leaders will tell us we're terrorist-humping idiots and do whatever they
damn well please. They might even increase our taxes to do it. That's
called leadership.


If Ahmadinejad thinks he can be our friend by honoring our heroes and
opening a dialog, he underestimates our ability to misinterpret him.
Fucking idiot. I hate him.

Windham
Today I am visiting the small town where I grew up: Windham NY. I have to write this post on my BlackBerry. If it looks odd, that's why. In Windham, they've heard good things about the Internet, but there's still a wait-and-see attitude. 


I haven't been back to Windham since I left 28 years ago. A big reason for leaving was the weather. So I carefully selected a calendar date with the lowest chance of death-by-snow. Furthermore, I checked the forecast before getting on the plane. There was only a ten percent chance of rain all week. So I left my umbrella home.


It's amazing how stupid you can get in 28 years.


As we dragged our luggage from Albany airport, lightning started a shock and awe campaign apparently aimed at toppling the Scott and Shelly regime. We tucked and rolled and made it to the rental car area just as the sky opened and the death-rain began. Before long, the rain turned to dime-sized hail and destroyed crops, stunned small animals, and made children cry.


"This is what 'ten percent chance of rain' means in Windham," I explained to my wife. You don't want to be here on a bad weather day.


Luckily, traffic was not an issue, since most of the time we were the only car on the road. If your car goes off the road in Windham, your best bet is reincarnation.


I tried to give my wife the audio tour of my hometown as we drove through, but I quickly realized all of my landmark references were based on memories of who allegedly got fingered where. That gets old faster than you'd think.


I kid, but Windham is actually a shockingly beautiful town and the people are nice. This is where I learned the art of humorous exaggeration. Exaggeration sounds funnier than "It rained." And they do have high speed Internet in Windham, except where I am right now.


The part about the dime-sized hail was true, but I am assured there is only a ten percent chance it will happen again today.

Aroused by Pie
There was a study in the late nineties that showed males become aroused by certain scents.


http://health.msn.com/centers/mensexualhealth/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100167992


The biggest winner in the smells-that-make-men-horny contest was pumpkin pie. The researchers are baffled by why that particular smell is so effective. Allow me to help them out with the explanation part.


When a man smells a pumpkin pie, it means there’s a 90% chance a woman baked it. And she must be around here someplace. That’s worth half a boner right there.


Researchers found that the combination of licorice and pumpkin pie worked even better than pumpkin pie alone. Again, duh. If I smell pumpkin pie AND licorice, the odds of a woman being nearby rocket to about 99.9%.


Second, making a pie is a lot of work compared to other things. So there’s a good chance the woman who baked it is a pleaser. The pleasing probably won’t stop with the pie, if you know what I mean, wink-wink.


Third, pumpkin pie is not the obvious first choice for baking. Apple pie is a more obvious choice. Chocolate cake is more obvious. A woman who bakes a pumpkin pie is clearly a little freaky. Gentleman, start your engines!


The research showed that perfume didn’t have the same effect on men as food smells. Again, that’s no surprise to me. When I smell perfume, my first thought is “What’s she trying to cover up?” I’m not thinking I got to get me some of that.


My weakness is vanilla. One whiff and I have to check my driver’s license to remember my name and address. I once made the mistake of getting vanilla scent after a car wash. My car has a stick shift. You can imagine the confusion. I spent twenty minutes trying to find first gear. I would still be there if the other customers hadn’t banded together to push my car into the street.

Coal: Can You Dig It?
Did you see the story about the two Chinese coal miners who survived six days after a tunnel collapse? They ate coal and drank their own urine.


http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070828/od_nm/china_mine_coal1_dc_1;_ylt=AjSdP8lISg1LTBPSwwJceN0E1vAI


I had many reactions to this story, and that’s not even counting “Eewwww!”


When I was young, parents encouraged their kids to eat their vegetables by saying, “People in India are starving.” This is the sort of parenting that teaches children values, such as stupidity. To this day, when I think about people who are starving, I eat a little extra. I think it helps.


Now, thanks to the miners, parents have a better argument. “Eat your broccoli, Brittany. Chinese miners only get to eat coal and drink piss.”


I am happy the miners survived. But their problems are not over. If you eat coal and drink piss ONE time, you’ll always be a coal-eating-piss-drinker. I don’t know if people in China tease each other, but if it’s anything like here, those miners are in for a tough time.


“Hey, Meng, can I refresh your drink?” Zzzzzip.


“Bartender, I’ll have a beer, and for my friend, just wiz in his mouth. And put a head on it.”


“If we run out of charcoal for the barbecue, Meng can squeeze out a few brickettes.”


One of my many mental hobbies is thinking up new country sayings. My newest one is “I’m thirstier than a Chinese coal miner.” While nothing can surpass my all-time favorite, “I’m hornier than a two-peckered dog,” this new one comes close.


What’s your favorite country saying?

Synchronicity
As regular readers of this blog know, all coincidences are clues that we are holograms programmed by our long dead ancestors before the planet was annihilated. How else could you explain the two stories forwarded to me today?


1. A Republican Senator has been arrested for lewd conduct in a restroom.


http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20467347/


2. Monkeys are sexually harassing women.


http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6959209.stm


This is a classic case of code reuse by our lazy ancestors who created our hologram. It’s practically the same story, i.e. an ugly male primate engages in allegedly inappropriate sexual advances. The programmers simply randomized some of the less important elements such as the type of primate, the location, and the intended sex partners. And remember this comes on the heels of the story I wrote about recently: Dwarf has sex with vacuum cleaner. It’s the same damned story with different characters.


Indeed, all of the news is nothing but basic stories with randomized features. Watch as I predict tomorrow’s headlines today:


EXTREME WEATHER BATTERS SOMEPLACE


IDIOTS KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE


POLITICIAN DOES SOMETHING ILLEGAL


PRIMATE ATTEMPTS INAPPROPRIATE SEX


EXPERTS WARN OF FINANCIAL CALAMITY


BIG COMPANY BUYS ANOTHER BIG COMPANY


FAMOUS PERSON DOES SOMETHING INTERESTING


A SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY MIGHT BE USEFUL IN TEN YEARS


GOVERNMENT FAILS TO ACHIEVE A GOAL


The real test of our hologram existence would be my ability to predict the future. In theory, if I am a replica of the actual human who programmed me, I would think the way he did. Therefore, the future will turn out much the way I would program it if it were up to me. So here’s my prediction:


Many of you will leave a comment complaining that I blog too much about our hologram existence. Some people will be compelled to mention The Matrix.

True Story
Sunday afternoon, a youth league basketball coach and his team play an away game in Pleasanton, CA. After the game, they grab some lunch at the In-n-Out Burger, then head home. The van with the team takes off, and the coach drives his beat-up old sedan to the gas station before the long trip home.


That’s when the coach realizes his wallet and cell phone are in his briefcase, which he left in the van. He has no gas, no money, no identification, and no phone. He’s also African-American, which he knows is going to make this next part especially challenging.


He walks around the pump and encounters a middle-aged white guy in workout clothes, gassing his BMW. The coach launches into his story about the basketball team, the hamburgers for lunch, the van, the briefcase, and he’s sure he’s not selling it.


“What do you need?” asked the guy with the BMW, judging the story to be legitimate.


“I don’t need any money,” explained the coach, defensively. “I just need some gas. Maybe I could just pump some from your pump after you finish?”


The BMW guy reached for his wallet and said, “How far are you going?” Again, the coach insisted he didn’t want money, just gas. He knew it would sound too suspicious to ask for cash. He had trouble believing he closed the sale with such a lame story, and he didn’t want to be thought of as a scammer.


The BMW guy handed him a twenty and said, “Is that enough?” The coach tried one more time to explain he wasn’t asking for money. The BMW guy just smiled and shrugged. The coach thanked him enthusiastically.


Was this an unlucky day for the coach, because he forgot his wallet? Or was it a lucky day because he found help so easily and it restored just a little bit of his faith in humanity?


I can answer that question, because I was the guy with the BMW. And it wasn’t until this morning that I realized he said he was heading to Monterey. If I had done the math, I would have realized twenty dollars would only get him halfway home. I just figured that out this morning.


So, thanks to my help, he’s probably stranded in Gilroy (the garlic capital of the world) and wondering why that briefcase-in-the-van story only worked once.


And in retrospect, I suppose I should have offered to let him use my cell phone. So I grant you it wasn’t a clean win for humanity. But I felt good about myself for half a day, and that was worth twenty bucks.


For the record, Coach, I would have given you forty bucks. I hope you found your way home from Gilroy.

Invent This Product
I’d love to have a complete scrapbook of all my vacations, but it’s too much work. That’s why I need a service that would create the scrapbook automatically, online. Here’s how it could work.


First, my digital camera should have GPS so it always knows where I am. When I download my photos, a Google map would pop up, and the photos would go into storage according to the points on the map where the pictures were taken, ordered by date. The map forms the backdrop for organizing the scrapbook.


Second, I would use a special credit card for all purchases on my vacation, from gas stations to hotels to restaurants. The special part is that the records of my purchases would feed into my automatic scrapbook software and coordinate it with the camera’s GPS data. That would be enough data for the scrapbook system to intelligently guess the name of the restaurant or attraction where I was at the time of the picture.


Third, the system needs face recognition software so it can label photos with at least the names of family and friends who appear in them. It doesn’t need to be 100% accurate, but it could give you a big head start.


Let’s say you take a picture of a family member standing in front of the hotel where you are staying. The GPS from your camera would provide the approximate location, and when the scrapbook system compared it to your credit card receipts, it would know you stayed at the hotel near those coordinates. Your digital photo would be automatically labeled “Bob at the Hilton in Cleveland, April 15, 2008.” And it would store those pictures at a labeled location on the Google map.


When the vacation is over, the scrapbook is 85% complete. You just have to check its assumptions and add/correct any descriptors you want.


You could run it as a slide show, with a little icon of a car traveling from location to location on the Google map, while the calendar date appears in the corner. When the icon reaches a destination from which there are photos, it displays them in a slide show. Optionally, the system could bring in pictures from other sources to beef up your scrapbook. For example, if you visited the Grand Canyon, it could bring in some stock pictures to round out your album. It could also capture a screen shot of the hotel or resort’s web site during the period you visited.


Google should invent this product.

My Life as a Hologram
I don’t tell this story often, because no one believes it.


It was 1979, my senior year at Hartwick College, in Oneonta NY. One early morning I woke up from a dead sleep and had what could best be described as a vision of my future. In this vision, I would move to San Francisco, and create something that would make me famous. And I saw myself standing on stage in front of a huge audience. At the time, I knew no one who lived in San Francisco. I didn’t even know anyone who had visited. It seemed entirely random. I was majoring in economics so I could become a banker in New York City, not a stage performer in San Francisco.


After graduating, I traded my beat-up Datsun 510 to my sister for a one-way ticket to Los Angeles, where my brother had moved a few years earlier. I slept in a sleeping bag on his couch and applied for banking jobs. I had two offers, and was planning to pick one of them.


Meanwhile, sometime after my so-called vision, an ex girlfriend dropped out of college and moved to San Francisco. While I was in LA, she invited me up for the weekend. I went. She convinced me that San Francisco was a much nicer place than LA, and I should move there. I said I’d stay if I could find a job on Monday. I was almost out of money. Otherwise, I would return to LA and accept one of the offers there.


On Monday morning, I walked into a branch of Crocker National Bank in San Francisco, asked for a job, and got one, as a teller. I’ve lived in the San Francisco area ever since. This is where I created Dilbert. And I have stood on stage in front of huge audiences a few hundred times, just as I saw it in the vision.


I’ve had several of these so-called visions. Most of them happened just the way I saw them. A few haven’t happened yet, but could. So how do I explain it?


The obvious explanation is that I remember the alleged visions that come true and forget the ones that don’t. I can’t rule that out. Another possibility is that I have some weird psychic ability. That seems unlikely. If people had that sort of ability it would have been measured in a lab by now.


Perhaps my subconscious makes all my decisions, and creates all of my so-called visions. Then it does its best to make me do the things that would make the visions come true. That seems like a perfectly good theory.


But my favorite theory is that I’m nothing but a hologram in a computer program built by my ancient self, before the planet was destroyed by some disaster. The reason I can glimpse my future is that I have all of the qualities of the real me who wrote my program. In other words, I can accurately imagine my future because it is playing out much like I would have authored it myself.


The great thing about this theory is that I can find all sorts of clues to validate it. For example, when I come up with a “new” idea only to discover that others have had the same thought, this fits my theory too. The reason other people have my same thoughts is because they were programmed by my ancient self, who only had a finite number of thoughts to build into the program. This reality is bound to have repeats.


Then there is all the science I don’t understand. One explanation is that it’s over my head. But I prefer the explanation that it is nothing but gibberish programmed into the system. The reason I don’t understand string theory, for example, is that there are no real scientists, only holograms programmed by my ancient self. And since my ancient self didn’t know string theory, he concealed that fact by making it seem as though it is just too complicated to understand.


That’s how I would have programmed it.

Donut Theory of the Universe Proven
Astronomers have confirmed that the universe has a big hole in the middle and is, for all practical purposes, a giant donut.

The Power of Stupid
A reader sent this story about his workplace.


-------------
“A theme from many of your previous comics came true to life for us today. Quality in the workplace.


Yesterday, a pointy-haired boss decided our meeting room needed nice motivational pictures on the wall. Twelve by eight inch, wooden frame, 1940s-style motivational tools (think 'Rosie the Riveter' in artwork, color and font). So an assistant was ordered to procure such things.


The first mistake was where the artwork was obtained from. Rather than pay $15 per picture for the real thing, it was decided to take the small JPEG images of what we wanted from a website that sold these trinkets. Cheap picture frames were bought (from a dollar store, by the look of things).


When the images were enlarged to fit into the 12 by 8 frames, the pixelation was terrible. In itself, this was funny. A picture that celebrates the idea of quality in the workplace looked cheap, and knowing it was a stolen image lessens the impact of the message slightly.”
-------------


This story made me think about one of the great wonders of capitalism: It is driven by morons who are circling the drain, and yet. . . it works!


Think about all the people working and earning paychecks from companies that will ultimately fail. It’s a lot of people. But until those companies fail, the employees are getting paid, buying goods, and contributing to the economy. After the failure, those employees hop over to another sinking ship, and so on.


Within successful companies, a huge portion of resources are dedicated to projects and products that will ultimately fail. But in the meantime, everyone is getting paid and propping up the economy.


I once worked in a bank, making loans to small business start-ups. Our rule of thumb was that 90% of new businesses fail. The exceptions were franchisees and pizza places. But we saw no shortage of people willing to mortgage their homes to start their own sporting good stores and boutique dress shops, despite the 90% chance of failure. Without clueless optimists, the economy would grind to a halt. My own career has been a long string of failures and a few notable successes.


I understand the math of capitalism, and how the few successes are so large they pay for all the failures and then some. But at any given moment, the majority of resources in a capitalist system are being pushed over a cliff by morons. This fascinates me. And it’s clearly the reason that humans rule the earth. We found a system to harness the power of stupid.


In the rest of the animal kingdom, being a moron is nothing but bad. A moron lion, for example, who can’t catch anything to eat, is adding nothing to the lion economy. But a moron human who starts a business selling garlic flavored mittens is stimulating the economy right up until the point of going out of business.


My point is that I hope the monkeys that already know how to use sticks for tools don’t start using leaves for money. If that happens, we’re screwed.

Likelihood of Revolution
Lately, with the popularity of President Bush in the low twenties, and the Supreme court tilting toward the right, and no one trusting voting results, I wonder what it would take to spark a revolution, or a coup.


The thing with history is that nothing seems likely until after it happens. So if your first reaction is to dismiss this possibility because it’s unlikely, you haven’t studied history. Everything that happens is unlikely.


So what series of events could cause an uprising? While I am not predicting it will happen, I think it’s more possible than you think. Let’s say, for the sake of argument, the following series of events unfold:


1. McCain, behind in the polls, somehow wins the nomination and the general election.


2. McCain’s win causes mistrust in voting machines, for reasons either real or imagined.


3. McCain intensifies the war in Iraq because he thinks it’s the right thing for the country.


4. Protesters take to the streets in sixties fashion. There are clashes with police. The media makes this THE story.


5. McCain, one of our oldest candidates, dies in office from natural causes. His vice president assumes the job. The vice president, chosen to appease the conservative base, is the most right wing politician ever, and makes Dick Cheney look like Bambii.


6. The new Vice President cracks down hard on protesters. He starts suspending even more civil liberties. Martial law is discussed as if it is imminent.


7. An opening on the Supreme Court allows the new president to push a conservative into the slot. This moves the court completely to the right. All abortions are banned in the United States.


8. The war in Iraq spreads to Iran, where once again, no signs of nuclear weapons production are found. This added war is so unpopular with the rest of the world that allies start withdrawing from NATO to form their own defense club.


9. Strained by the war in Iraq, and now Iran, and potentially Syria, the American economy crumbles.


Now would there be a revolution? And which part of this scenario couldn’t happen?

Pascal’s Wager
In yesterday's post I described an argument that reminded people of something called Pascal's Wager.


In a nutshell, Pascal was a dude who argued you should consider Christianity because if it's true, the downside of not believing is eternal Hell. But if you become a Christian and there's no God, all you've lost is your Sunday mornings. (Here I am simplifying.)


Many of my blog readers left comments alluding to the well-known "flaws" in Pascal's argument. Here’s a handy list of them.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_Wager#Rebuttals


Chief among the alleged flaws in Pascal’s argument is that you still have to pick the correct religion among many, or else you go to Hell anyway.


Sure. But picking any religion that promises salvation slightly improves your odds over picking an option that doesn’t. You're still probably doomed, given your bad religion-picking skills, but a one-in-a-million chance of reducing the risk of eternal Hell is a move worth taking, mathmatically speaking.


Another noted "flaw" in Pascal's wager is that you can't rule out the possibility that only skeptics are spared from Hell. Perhaps, it is argued, God loves the spunky fact-loving personality of skeptics and saves them alone, or saves them in the greatest percentage.


That argument passes the math test, but does it pass the sniff test? It’s a viewpoint that exists only as a debate tool. While we can't rule it out, surely it is the worst bet if you must pick a theory of God. No rational person on earth, including skeptics, has concluded that God prefers skeptics over believers.


Personally, if I were more rational, and less focused on immediate gratification, I would become a moderate, peace-loving Muslim. My reasoning is that Islam has the best chance of becoming the dominant world religion in the future, and therefore probably has God’s backing, if he exists. The Muslim belief that death is sometimes a good thing is a huge advantage in a future where weapons are improving, and the only thing keeping people from using them is fear of death.


If you believe God exists, the smart money says he’s backing the team with the best strategy and long term viability. Based on what I see today, I’m betting on Islam being the only religion in a thousand years. Once you can build your own nuke from stuff you buy online, don’t be betting on the Buddhists.


I realize it's unscientific to try and compare one absurdity to another. But if you assume our perceptions are often flawed, you have to allow the possibility that some apparent absurdities are due to our limited powers of perception. So, for example, while the notion of a loving God who allows eternal damnation seems absurd, it is less absurd than assuming the world is run by invisible unicorns, or that God discriminates against those who believe in him.


The God theory has built into it the assumption we are not bright enough to understand the mind of an omnipotent being. That sounds reasonable. Hey, if God exists, and he does things different that I would, just maybe the problem is on my end. If you believe in God, the apparent absurdities have a reasonable explanation, even if wrong.


But what’s the reasonable explanation for God preferring skeptics? If God appreciates reasoning skills, he can’t be too impressed by the fact he created the entire Universe and skeptics still can’t find any good clues he exists. God would only be impressed by skeptics if God did NOT exist. You can’t top that for absurdity.


Back to Islam. It also has the most satisfying answer to the multiple prophet issue. If we assume God speaks through prophets, as all God-oriented religions do, then how can you be sure the last prophet finished the job? Islam gives us Mohammed, the "seal of the prophets," and promises that God intends him to be the last one. That’s a tidy package.


All the other religions seem to leave open the possibility that God has a few more prophets up his sleeve. If you bet on one of those other religions, you can't know for sure if you're living by God's first draft or his finished manuscript.


Picking the "right" religion is a long shot no matter how hard you try. But if rational thought has any value at all, it's in narrowing down options and improving our odds of making good choices. Rational thought hasn't led anyone to conclude that there's a God who only saves people who don't believe he exists. We can't rule it out, but can't we rate its likelihood compared to a God who prefers that his lumps of clay hold him in higher esteem than their own eye crud?


I’d prefer to make all of my decisions on the basis of peer reviewed science. But I don’t have that option when considering the great beyond. So I settle for looking at the competing absurdities and picking the one that seems relatively least absurd.


There are other arguments against Pascal’s wager, but none of them looked any stronger than the ones I mentioned here.


Pascal's wager was designed to make people consider the importance of grappling with the question of a Christian God. That's not my argument. I simply borrowed the math part of his argument and followed it to its logical conclusion: The most rational worldview is moderate Islam.


And since I am not a Muslim, I must conclude that I am not rational. I sure hope God likes moist robots.


I wrote this at 3 AM. I won’t even pretend it makes sense.


[Update: Early commenters are noting that someone who only pretends to believe, to get into heaven, won't fool God. But the science strongly supports the notion that going through the motions of believing will, in most normal people, turn them into believers in fact. It's the same principle as why people who join a political party start to believe most of the positions of the party. -- Scott]

The Atheist Who Thought He Was God
Can we ever be sure about anything in life?


Is a feeling of 99% certainty enough to say you “know” something? Or do you need to feel 99.9999999999% certain before you’re willing to commit?


If you say you need to be 100% certain, you don’t understand how human brains work. It’s common for the human brain to be certain about things that later turn out to be completely false. It happens all the time, to everyone. If it has ever happened to you, then you know you can’t trust your own powers of certainty.


This brings me to atheists. In order to be certain that God doesn’t exist, you have to possess a godlike mental capacity – the ability to be 100% certain. A human can’t be 100% certain about anything. Our brains aren’t that reliable. Therefore, to be a true atheist, you have to believe you are the very thing that you argue doesn’t exist: God.


Perhaps you will argue that being 99.999999% certain God doesn’t exist is just as good as being 100% sure. That strikes me as bad math. As other philosotainers have famously noted, a small chance of spending eternity in Hell has to be taken seriously. Eternity is a long time.


Let me put this in perspective. You might be willing to accept a 10% risk of going skiing and getting hurt, but you wouldn’t accept a 10% risk of a nuclear war. The larger the potential problem, the less risk you are willing to tolerate.


An eternity in Hell is the largest penalty there could ever be. So while you might not worry about a .00000000001% chance of ending up in Hell, you can’t deny the math. .00000000001% of eternity is a lot longer than your entire mortal life. Infinitely longer.


I sometimes call myself an atheist because it’s too hard to explain Spinoza’s version of god. And it’s too hard to explain that agnosticism is the only intellectually defensible position.


Are there any atheists out there?


[Update Bonus Question: What's the difference between a "weak atheist" and an agnostic? Don't both subscribe to uncertainty?]

The Secret
You’ve probably heard about, and perhaps read, a book phenomenon called The Secret. I haven’t read the book, but I’ve seen lots of negative reviews about its new age mumbo jumbo.


As I understand it, the central concept is something the book calls the Law of Attraction. Essentially, you focus on positive things and the universe will attract those things to you.


One skeptical reviewer picked the most outrageous sounding example in the book to point out how ridiculous it is. Apparently the book claims, without science to support it, that if you want to be thin, you should avoid overweight people, even to the extent of avoiding looking at them.


Clearly, that’s mumbo jumbo.


Today I read in the news that researchers have discovered weight to be “socially contagious.” Your chances of becoming obese are 57% higher if you have ONE friend who is obese.


http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/25/health/webmd/main3097001.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_3097001


It’s probably premature to declare this a fact. The media isn’t good at getting this sort of thing right. But I’d be surprised if it’s wrong. After all, humans conform to their friends’ habits in every other realm, from clothing, to music, to choice of words. It can’t be too surprising to learn that they start eating the same.


Friends influence friends. That’s obvious. But can you also become overweight just by looking at overweight people? My guess is that you can. Humans are natural copiers. Your choice of clothing, for example, is influenced just as much by what you see on strangers as on friends. And your notion of what is acceptable and normal is probably more determined by strangers than by your one or two close friends.


How about success? Can the universe provide success just by focusing on it and avoiding thinking about failure? I’ve seen no research on that topic, but wouldn’t you be surprised if success isn’t socially contagious too?


Stanford University creates an enormous number of entrepreneurs and other successful people. I’ve often hypothesized that half of Stanford’s success is because the students are brilliant, well taught, and screened for high potential, and half is because the environment breeds success contagion. I imagine it would be difficult to graduate from Stanford and settle for an ordinary life. The impulse to copy the other go-getters would be mighty strong.


I’ve often written about my own experiences with affirmations, the practice of writing your goals 15 times a day. It seems to work much of the time, at least in my experience, but presumably not because of any magic. At least one probable explanation for its perceived effectiveness is that focusing on goals changes the person who is doing the focusing.


In a book called The Luck Factor, the author and researcher, Richard Wiseman (Google it), discovered that people who expect luck will notice opportunities in their environment more readily than those who don’t. And he learned that you can train people to expect luck, and cause an improvement in their ability to spot opportunities, that look like luck, when they pop up. I can imagine affirmations tuning a person in the same way, until it seems that extra luck is being provided by the universe, but all that’s happening is that it’s more easily recognized.


Affirmations probably also increases a person’s natural level of optimism, especially if you believe it works. I can imagine optimism working to harden people against the inevitable setbacks and obstacles along the way to success. To the extent that affirmations might increase a person’s stick-to-itiveness, his perception might be that the universe is removing barriers.


To be fair, there’s also some selective memory at play. I’m sure people who use affirmations, or The Secret, tend to remember the successes and forget the failures. I recall about six ridiculously unlikely successes of my own with affirmations, and one quasi-failure that I still think will pan out. (There’s the optimism thing.) Realistically, I might be forgetting some failures. And I have no way of knowing whether I would have had the successes without affirmation.


As I said, I haven’t read The Secret. I don’t endorse it. But if you think the concept has no value because it’s not backed by science, don’t be surprised if that changes.

Another Already Invented Invention
I hate waiting for my computer to do something, or a web page to open. Why can’t someone invent a replacement for the little hourglass, or the browser progress bar, that is more interesting to look at?


For example, I think it would be hilarious to see a little graphic of two dogs humping. The hourglass only shows for a few seconds, usually, and every time the humping dog replacement popped up, it would make me smile.


Or how about flashing a compliment to the user, such as, “You are smart and sexy.” I could read that a billion times and never get tired of it. I’d like to customize my own messages too.


This product would be too trivial to sell directly, so you’d have to monetize it a different way. For example, it could be a giveaway for people who buy some other type of software on the Internet. The retailer would pay you for the right to use it as a gift item.


Now tell me who already invented this.

Inventing the Already Invented
People always ask me where my ideas come from. It feels as if my ideas originate in my mind, in a something-from-nothing way. But sometimes I think my brain is some sort of zeitgeist vacuum, sucking in scraps of ideas already floating around the universe until there’s enough of one kind of scrap that I notice.


For example, in a recent post I described what I thought was an original idea for using cell phones to arrange ride sharing, thus saving the world by reducing fuel use. Meanwhile, as several readers pointed out, something similar was already being created for Facebook users:


http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid={492C5820-C43D-4B95-98ED-5466C7A92D26}


This happens with most of my ideas. No matter what I write, I get at least one e-mail with a link to someone who said it first, or invented it first. So I wonder if I am actually a creative person or simply jacked into the matrix.


Let’s test the theory. I’ll describe my new idea, and you find the link to someone who is already doing it.


I’ll call my idea weirdfeet.com because all the better URLs are taken. It’s a website where people simply keep a record of what athletic footwear fits their particular feet. For example, I have a somewhat flat foot, and I’ve found only two models of tennis shoes that work for me. I’d register on the system and enter my two types of tennis shoes.


Once enough people have registered, I can find people who are happy with the exact size and brand of footwear as me. Then, when my brands are discontinued, or I want to branch out, I check the website to find out what other tennis shoes are being worn by people who were happy with my same brands and sizes. Their feet are probably a lot like mine. Perhaps not 100% of the time, but it’s better than starting blind.


Weirdfeet.com could make money on ads, and perhaps make referral money for links to online sellers. In terms of ad revenue, the key to a successful site is having a user base that is in the market for something specific. Everyone on this site would be a buyer of athletic footwear. And if they registered a tennis shoe, they are also purchasers of tennis rackets. Advertisers love that.


Does this site exist? Or did I just give away the best idea I ever had?

Politeness
Recently I saw a sign outside a store that said, “Please enjoy our food and drinks outside.” It seemed so much nicer than the more direct “No food and drinks.” And it reminded me of my friend Jason’s favorite joke. It goes like this:


Two Southern ladies, Maribelle and AnneMarie, were sitting on the porch drinking mint juleps. They have the following conversation, best imagined with an upscale Southern drawl:


Maribelle: AnneMarie, do you see this huge diamond ring?


AnneMarie: Yes.


Maribelle: My husband bought this for me.


AnneMarie: Isn’t that special.


Maribelle: Do you see that Jaguar in the parking lot?


AnneMarie: Yes.


Maribelle: My husband bought that for me.


AnneMarie: Isn’t that special.


Maribelle: And you know that mansion I live in?


AnneMarie: Yes.


Maribelle: My husband bought that for me.


AnneMarie: Isn’t that special.


Maribelle: What did your husband buy for you, AnneMarie?


AnneMarie: My husband sent me to finishing school. That’s where I learned to say, “Isn’t that special” instead of “fuck you.”


What’s your favorite joke?

Things I Used to Know
When I was a kid, it was common knowledge that you would get cramps and drown if you went swimming within an hour of eating. It never occurred to me that if eating and swimming was a deadly combination, the bottom of every pool would be covered with corpses. I never heard of anyone perishing from a sandwich-related drowning. It turns out there was a good reason: Eating before swimming doesn’t cause cramps after all.


Now it’s common knowledge that your cell phone can bring down an airliner. But if that were true, the airlines would confiscate your phones, not just ask you to turn them off. And given the fact that at least one moron leaves his phone on during every flight, you’d expect at least one cell phone-related crash. I’m still waiting.


Everyone knows you can get AIDS from oral sex. Any doctor will confirm that. It’s common knowledge. Yet there are plenty of teens engaging in oral sex and no other kind of sex. Is there one confirmed case of a virgin getting AIDS from a blow job? I don’t know the answer to that question, but it’s odd that the sidewalks in front of high schools aren’t covered with corpses.


We Americans know that Al Qaeda has cells in America planning to attack. And we know that there are more terrorists than ever, thanks to the Iraq war. It’s easy to get people and explosives into the country on private boats or across our porous borders. The woods must be full of terrorists by now. Apparently all the slow ones came to America. I mean, Iraq has almost as many car bombs as cars. Those guys are industrious. But the American terrorists couldn’t put together one car bomb in six years. I know, I know – every one of those American terror cells is waiting for a nuke so they can do something more fabulous than last time. Apparently no one told Al Qaeda in Iraq what an excellent strategy it is to do nothing for six years.


Everyone knows most vegetarians don’t get enough protein. You probably know a few vegetarians yourself. Have you ever heard of an adult vegetarian being hospitalized because of protein deficiency? You’d expect to go to the hospital for a bunion operation and be turned away because all the beds are full of vegetarians with lackofproteinitis.


I have been thinking along these lines lately because of all the comments on this blog about my high intake of Diet Coke. Many people believe the aspartame is dangerous, and indeed you can find mention on the Internet of studies that support that notion, along with ones that don’t. And more recently, a study showed a link between obesity and heart risk for soda drinkers, both diet and regular. These types of risks are more subtle than an airline crash or a car bomb, so I wouldn’t necessarily expect to see fresh corpses clutching soda cans. But I wonder if it’s my cynicism of common wisdom or just cognitive dissonance that causes me to choose the deliciousness and easy caffeine of my Diet Coke over the alleged risks. All I know for sure is that thinking about it just made me thirsty.


(Warning: Do not get your health and safety tips from cartoonists. I’m just making observations, not recommendations. I’m sure the comment section will provide plenty of counter points.)

Immigration
It’s hard to talk about immigration without sounding like a racist. So let me just say this and get it out of the way: I think Mexicans are superior to me.


By “me,” I am referring to people who are part English, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, Dutch, German, and Native American. There are three of us that I know of. I think my brother and sister would agree that we kind of suck compared to Mexicans.


Compare me to Mexicans on any dimension and I lose. For example, I like to think I’m smart, but realistically, if you pick any topic, there is at least one Mexican who knows more than me. Or is it “more than I”? I don’t know, but I guarantee there’s a Mexican somewhere who does.


And don’t get me started about common sense and street smarts. If my car breaks down someplace where my Blackberry doesn’t have signal, there’s a good chance I’ll die before I figure out how to get help. Compare that to the guy I can see from my office window, working construction down the street. He walked here from Mexico and learned how to be a carpenter just by looking at a hammer. I speak exactly one language. He’s been here a month and knows 1.1 languages. Advantage: Mexican guy.


Mexicans have great looking skin that resists sunburn. I have skin that looks like tapioca spilled on canvas, and I have to wear sunscreen to sit in front of my computer monitor.


How about durability? I can hurt my back just eating a bowl of strawberries. I wouldn’t last long picking them.


How about character? In the suburbs where I live, most people with above average incomes hire housecleaners to come once a week. It’s almost always a crew of three Mexicans. Each crew has a wad of house keys. In the 29 years I have lived in California, the total number of thefts I have heard attributed to Mexican housekeepers is zero. Now, in the interest of not incriminating yourself, compare that to your best male friend who is not a Mexican and ask yourself how many of these crimes he has committed:


- Sex with an underage girl when he was 18
- Marijuana
- Speeding
- Fudging on taxes
- Underage drinking
- Illegal copying of songs
- Driving with a blood alcohol level above the legal limit
- Stealing office supplies


There’s a good chance your best male friend is a frickin’criminal.


You might argue that any Mexican in this country illegally has broken a law, and that is obviously true. He is guilty of working hard so he can send money home and lift his family from wretchedness. I automatically like that kind of guy, whereas your best friend sounds like a jerk.


I can see the arguments on both sides of the immigration issue. And I’m sure I’d have a different view if I lived in some gang-infested part of Southern California. But the dirty little secret that most Californians know is that Mexican immigrants, legal or otherwise, are bringing up the national average on the “good people” meter. If that were not so obviously the case, the borders would have been shut a long time ago. I’d be down there myself with some boards and a hammer and the hope that some guy on the other side would show me how to use them.


[Update: Unlike many of the readers directed to this blog from racist web sites, Mexicans understand satire. If you do not understand satire, I recommend less challenging forms of entertainment.]

Presidential Polyps
President Bush recently had some polyps removed from his colon. Sometimes polyps can turn cancerous, but I doubt his are. After all, President Bush hasn’t had much luck finding weapons of ass destruction.


I’m posting this now before someone else thinks of it. I might already be too late.


And allow me to be the first to wonder aloud how the surgeons could see past Condi’s head to see those polyps.


This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime humor situations. You can play along at home. Leave a comment with your own best joke about the president’s semi-colon.


Go.

Powerball
When I saw the headline “Oklahoma couple claims $105.8M Powerball prize” I wondered about the age and profession of the husband. I also wondered if he would keep his job. And by “wondered” I mean I already knew it would be an older guy in a blue collar job who plans to keep working. Isn’t it always?


http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11669215/


I don’t want to accuse the Powerball people of fixing these lotteries. But I notice that the people who win are coincidentally the people who would be best for marketing future Powerball lotteries. You know what story you will never hear about a lottery winner? It’s this one:


“Wealthy bachelor neurosurgeon, age 30, wins $300 million in the lottery. The lucky winner, Winston Arbuckle III, says he plans to “Buy another yacht, smoke more weed, and float around the Mediterranean until I die from the clap.” Asked about his neurosurgery practice, Arbuckle quipped, “I never liked sick people.”


No, you will only hear stories about the modest couple with the hard-working husband, usually in his late fifties or early sixties. They will be “thinking about” getting a nicer house. In this latest lottery story, the husband is a long-haul trucker whose truck has recently crapped out. He plans to buy a new (used) truck and keep working. He says there’s only so much time you can spend fishing.


That’s his story. And I believe it. But I can’t help wondering if he had any thoughts along these lines:


“Holy shit. I don’t want to spend more time with my wife. What am I going to do? I know, I’ll say I’m going to keep working. That will make me look like a great guy. But I’ll hire a chauffeur to drive the truck for me. I’ll trick out the trailer part with a beer tap, big screen TV and a sofa. And I’ll only pretend to be transporting air conditioners. I’ll just tell Jeeves to drive me around the country while I sit in the back eating onion rings and farting into the couch. We’ll only stop to refuel and pick up prostitutes. YEE-HAAA!!!”


Did I just accidentally write a script for the next Adam Sandler movie?

Terrorism or Stupidity?
Terrorism is a good strategy in some situations, such as getting rid of foreign occupiers. I suppose it could work whenever the objective is clear and the enemy is capable of making the change desired. In those cases, terrorism is a rational, albeit horrible, strategy.


But how could terrorism wipe out Israel?


The citizens of Israel don’t consider themselves visitors. They can’t “go home.” So how can terrorism ever succeed in that particular case?


Imagine a worst case scenario where terror weapons become so effective that Hamas and Hezbollah can literally make Israel uninhabitable. The residents of Israel pack up and become refugees. The Palestinians go skipping into Israel and settle into their new homes that were, in some cases, their old homes. What happens next?


If you guessed radical ex-Israelis would start using terrorism on the residents of New Palestine, you would be right. It’s a certainty, especially if the tools of terrorism are so good that they are capable of depopulating a country. It wouldn’t require many angry ex-Israelis to once again depopulate the entire country through terror.


Surely any form of terror that is effective enough to cause all Jews to leave Israel would be good enough to cause any future residents to move too. You have to wonder if Hamas has thought it through.


I think Israel’s best strategy would be to label their current conflict a “War on Stupid.” It wouldn’t be a racist thing, because it only applies to the people who think Israel can be wiped out by terror and replaced by Palestinians who would live in peace. By any objective measure, that’s stupid.


Sometimes labels change reality because they change how we think of things. Imagine if the captured terrorists in Israeli prisons were forced to wear dunce caps and write essays on their theory of how terrorism could “wipe out Israel.” After they write the essay, assuming they directly answer the assignment question, they are released without serving any further time. Israel could publish the essays so everyone can get a good chuckle out of them. I think it would make terrorism less glamorous.

Iran
There are two ways the United States can overthrow the government of Iran:


1. Massive military attack
2. Withdraw from Iraq


Inflation in Iran is running at 17%. Lately, Iran is experiencing civil unrest because they don’t have enough refinery capacity to produce gasoline.


http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19457357/


If America withdraws from Iraq, it will force Iran to spend massive amounts of money to stabilize and influence their dangerous neighbor. I doubt the Iranian economy is strong enough to handle the burden of Iraq. Before long, either the Iranian government will fall or it will have to be nice to the rest of the world to get help. And that means opening the Iranian nuclear facilities to full inspections and dropping support for Hezbollah.


The current Iranian government is unlikely to make those compromises. That’s why the citizens will demand a new one. Iran isn’t a democracy, but it’s the second closest thing in the region, after Israel. The population of Iran is highly skewed toward young people. That alone spells change. I wouldn’t be surprised if Iran ended up staggering toward a more fully democratic process. The systems for democracy in Iran are already in place. All they need to do is remove the Mullah’s control over which candidates can run.


A violent revolution might be unnecessary. If enough people go to the streets, the Mullah’s in charge could decide it’s in their best interest to be more liberal about allowing who runs for office, and not overruling the politicians after they are elected. The people who get elected might find it in their best interest to get along with the United States and Europe. In a hundred years, I could imagine the Mullahs becoming more like the monarchy in Great Britain, with more moral authority than legal authority.


None of this is likely, because I don’t believe the United States will withdraw enough troops from Iraq to make any geopolitical difference to Iran. It’s just interesting to think about unintended consequences, since those seem to be the only kind of consequences we ever see.

Irony Storm
In yesterday’s post I dared to say Paris Hilton entertains me, and I confessed I liked her because she works when she doesn’t need to, she has a sense of humor, and I’ve never heard of her being mean. This caused a Category 5 irony storm in the comments.


My favorite comments came from people who believe Paris Hilton’s television show on E!, The Simple Life, is a reality show about two stupid rich girls who do mean things. I hate to be a spoiler, but it’s a show produced by smart people, starring two rich girls who pretend to be mean and stupid. Their target audience is people who aren’t bright enough to know the show is staged.


And people wonder how I can be entertained by Paris Hilton. Good lord, the woman gives and she gives. This is performance art, and you’re part of the show, even if all you’re doing is strenuously denying its entertainment value and causing me to write this post that you are now reading.


My other favorite comments came from people who angrily point out how wrong it is to be entertained by something as trivial and unimportant as Paris Hilton’s life. This raises an interesting question: What the hell are you doing that’s so important? You’re not only reading The Dilbert Blog, but you’re leaving a frickin’ comment. How can you afford to take time out from your primary activity of performing free heart surgery on poor African babies?


My third favorite comments came from the people who say Paris is a racist. (This might come as a surprise to Lionel Richie.) Yes, I know she used the N-word on tape. I’ll bet she has also called people motherf*ckers without believing they actually have sex with their mothers. Sometimes you pick the most shocking word because it’s the most shocking word. I don’t know what’s in Paris’ heart, but I’m positive you don’t either.


I was also wondering how much economic value Paris has contributed to the world. If you put a price on the advertising budgets that support the media coverage she generates, plus her TV show, her movie roles, her magazine covers, I’ll bet the dollar value of her contribution to the world is in the billions. Those billions generate taxes that go to important social services such as feeding the poor and protecting our soldiers. And don’t get me started about the tens of millions of masturbators who appreciate her. You can’t put a price on that.


Clearly Paris has made some bad judgment calls. When cameras are rolling, you really ought to be more careful about what comes out of your mouth, and what goes into it. But I have to wonder how many of her critics could survive continuous video surveillance and be mistaken for Gandhi. I couldn’t. I don’t like your odds either.


In summary, if you enjoy opera more than you enjoy stories about Paris Hilton, you might believe you are superior. That’s the second clue there’s something seriously wrong with you.

Can’t…Resist…
Well, by now he’s in Paris. I’m referring to Paris Hilton’s boyfriend. Unless you live in a pineapple under the sea, you know that Paris just got out of jail. She’s got some catching up to do.


Paris’s legal problems started last year when she was arrested for driving drunk. In the following months she got stopped twice by officers for driving with a suspended license. The second stop resulted in jail time. My question is why, after leaving jail today, she didn’t do a few shots of tequila in front of reporters, use her prison skills to hotwire a car, and try to swerve home on her own. What was suddenly stopping her?


Instead, Paris let her parents pick her up at the prison in an SUV. I assume their chauffeur was liquored up so Paris would feel at home. Otherwise she’d be sitting in the back seat screaming, “Why is this car moving in a straight line?!! What’s wrong?!!!”


Paris has stated that she will no longer “act dumb,” because that’s “not who I am.” She says she’s worried about all the young girls who view her as a role model.


Speaking of jail, if your daughter is using Paris Hilton as a role model, you probably belong in one.


Tonight, Paris will appear on Larry King, presumably not acting dumb. If you think you can keep me from watching that train wreck, you are mistaken. I’m clearing the calendar. I can’t wait to watch Larry – who is more than 300 years old – ask Paris if she got any girl-on-girl action in the joint. They have the whole hour together and he’s going to run out of innocent questions soon after “Did you enjoy jail?”


If you want to enhance your viewing pleasure, just imagine that Larry is furiously pleasuring himself under the desk as he interviews Paris. It will make the questions sound naughtier:


“So….Did you take showers with the other women?”


I kid, but I have to confess I like Paris. I’ve never heard a report of her being mean. She works when she doesn’t need to. She has a sense of humor. And she knows how to enjoy herself. That’s more than most people have to offer the world. And we’ve all done our share of boneheaded things. If you think about it objectively, her career depends on being fascinating to millions of people. She probably does that better than whatever-the-hell you’re doing and calling a career. I’m glad she’s out of jail so she can go back to the important work of entertaining me.

Champagne Moments
I remember the day I got a call from United Media telling me they wanted to offer me a contract to be a syndicated cartoonist. Yay!


But hold the champagne, I thought. The contract was for what they call a “development deal.” That means you work together for six months, and at the end they decide whether or not to sell your comic to newspapers. About four months into my development deal, United Media informed me they planned to launch Dilbert. Yay!


But hold the champagne. There’s no guarantee that enough newspapers will buy the comic to make it successful. As it turned out, only a few dozen smaller papers picked up Dilbert. You need sales in major markets to really get things rolling. One day, after a few years of limping along toward oblivion, the Boston Globe decided to run Dilbert. Yay!


But hold the champagne. That doesn’t mean the readers of the Boston Globe will like the comic. It got off to a rocky start, but eventually it found an audience and stayed. Yay!


But hold the champagne. One major newspaper isn’t enough. I needed lots more. The new newspaper clients trickled in at nearly the same rate as existing clients cancelled. It was five steps forward and four steps back. My editor at United Media suggested that maybe a publisher would be interested in a Dilbert book, and if successful, perhaps that could get newspapers more interested. Andrews McMeel Publishing agreed to publish my business-themed book, “Build a Better Life by Stealing Office Supplies.” Yay!


But hold the champagne. It takes a long time to write a book and get it published. About 18 months later, the book hit the market. It was a modest success, but didn’t set the world on fire. The book helped newspaper sales a little, and the publisher asked for another book. Yay!


The second book didn’t do as well as the first, although it made money. But at least new sales to newspapers were exceeding cancellations by a better margin. Yay!


And so it went, in ant-sized steps forward. Every pat on the back came with a kick in the nuts. I worked for ten years without a day off. During one particularly busy year, I held a full-time job at the phone company, wrote and drew Dilbert, and wrote a book called “The Dilbert Principle.” I didn’t sleep much that year. It was my first hard cover book. Yay!


The Dilbert Principle found the bottom of the best seller list fairly quickly. Each week it climbed until it hit a wall at #2. Dennis Rodman’s tell-all book held the top spot and refused to let go. You would think that having the #2 best selling non-fiction book would be a good reason to crack open the champagne. But I waited. I hoped. And each week I got the call from my publisher, “You’re number two again.” I was happy about my book’s success, of course, but something was missing.


Finally, I got the call. “You’re number one.” I can’t describe what that felt like. If you’re thinking it feels a lot like being number two, only slightly better, you missed it by a light year. I was home alone when I got the news, and I cried for about two hours. Life changed. Newspapers started snapping up Dilbert. Someone released the media hounds. Dilbert was showing up on the major magazine covers. I was booked on the morning shows. It was several years before I could come up for air.


I still haven’t popped the champagne. I just raise the bar for what would be the right moment, and tell myself how tasty it will be if I ever accomplish something special in my work. Apparently the thing inside me that makes me work so hard is the same thing that keeps me unsatisfied. It’s a package deal. The best you can hope for is a family that understands.

Creative Question
A few years ago I was invited down to DreamWorks to see if there was any potential for collaborating on something non-Dilbert. Nothing ever came of that meeting, but in the process I learned something fascinating that I’ve been puzzling about ever since. Maybe you can help me figure out something.


The problem with creating a G-rated CGI blockbuster, like Shrek, or Cars, is that all the obvious categories have been taken. Kids are interested in only a few things in their movies:


1. Other kids
2. Creatures of any kind
3. Princesses
4. Magic and super powers


Shrek III, for example, has all of those elements. It’s no surprise it’s a huge hit. So here’s your creative question for the day: What subject and setting hasn’t yet been done as a kid-oriented CGI movie?


Here are some that HAVE been done:


Bugs
Monsters
Super heroes
Cars
African animals
Suburban animals
Robots
Toys
Fairy Tale creatures
Fish
Dinosaurs
Ghosts


Pixar has a new movie coming out about a rat that works in a kitchen. I’m sure it’s a fine film and will do well, as all other Pixar movies have. But honestly, my first reaction on seeing the rat in the kitchen trailer was “they ran out of creatures.” It’s no one’s fault. There are only so many types of creatures in the universe.


I’ll get the ball rolling with a few types of creatures that haven’t been in recent kid-oriented CGI blockbusters as far as I know:


Aliens
Birds
Angels


Now it’s your turn. What creatures are left for the next movie?


[Update: Okay, okay. Penguins and Chicken Little and Valiant were birds. See how hard it is to come up with something new?]

Good Stories
It has come to my attention that most people have no good stories. If you ask people to tell their best stories, you get blank stares and then something along the lines of “Well, once I lost my wallet.”


This has long puzzled me because I’m full of stories. How could I have so many, and other people have so few?


My brother made the same observation recently. Like me, he has plenty of stories that would make your jaw drop. And he noticed that other people seem to have none. One theory for this apparent discrepancy is that everyone’s life includes plenty of fascinating events but few people organize them in their memories as stories.


I have the same facility for jokes, which are essentially little stories. If I hear a joke once, I own it forever. Usually I’ll remember some seed of the joke – a key word or concept, and I can reproduce the rest of it by understanding how jokes are constructed. Apparently I have a story-oriented brain.


Now I suppose I owe you a story. Fair enough. I’ll pull one from the bag.


Several years ago, I thought of a patentable idea. It might be my best idea ever. The idea combines electronic calendars, such at Outlook, with advertising. So if, for example, you scheduled on your calendar “paint house,” that information would be sent anonymously to a service where house painters could offer themselves. The vendors – painters in this example – wouldn’t know who you are. All they would know is that someone in your zip code plans to have his house painted on a particular date.


Painters would respond through the system with rates and other information about their service. Most important, they would only respond if they were available to do the work on that day. None of their advertisements would appear on your computer until you clicked to view them. It’s the ultimate form of advertisement: It applies to you specifically, and you don’t need to see it unless you want to.


The system would check your calendar for all sorts of key words, from “vacation” to “birthday” to “graduation,” and match them with vendors that might be of interest. And of course you would have to check a box to “publish” your calendar entry. Nothing personal would be sent to the system.


My idea would have been a “process patent,” involving the system that keeps users anonymous and negotiates which vendors get through the filter. I imagined that vendors would pay to be part of the service.


Anyway, I hired a patent lawyer, searched to make sure no one already had the patent, and submitted my idea. I looked forward to selling the patent to Microsoft for a billion dollars.


A few days later, I went to the gym. I was working out on the resistance machines and noticed that some guy kept staring at me. Eventually he introduced himself. He recognized me as “the Dilbert guy” and wondered if I would be interested in doing something to benefit his start-up company. I asked what his company’s future product would be. A few sentences into his description, I interrupted him. “Hold on,” I said. “I have to stop you there because the service you’re describing – and you won’t believe this – I just submitted for a patent.”


“What?” he asked.


Somehow, in the most ridiculous coincidence of my entire life, we were both working on the same idea at the same time, and ended up talking about it at a gym in San Ramon.  When I described my patent application, he confirmed that it was essentially the same idea as his. Sadly for me, his patent application was in the mail a month or so before mine. Talk about your “oh shit” moments.


A few years later, I got my response from the patent office. They found an existing patent, about five years old, that they thought covered my idea. In my view, the existing patent had no resemblance to my idea, and didn’t explain the service that my patent was designed to accommodate. But the existing patent was so broad it could be construed that way. So I didn’t get my patent, and, I assume, neither did the guy I met at the gym.


Life is 10% effort and 90% lucky timing.

Who Will Kill all the Senior Citizens?
Recently I became immortal. It started a few months ago when I was doing some research on the Internet. And by research, I mean I clicked on a link that led me to another, then another, until I was reading something written by a stranger with no credibility. That’s how I learn.


Anyway, the stranger with no credibility was writing about some research done by another stranger with no credibility who was giving some chemicals to mice and dogs who themselves have no credibility. The chemical was resveratrol, an ingredient found in red wine. Apparently you don’t get enough of it by being a wino. You have to get it in concentrated form. I forget the details, but I think the first mouse that got the concentrated resveratrol lived 30% longer and started having an affair with Maria Shriver. One of the dogs with resveratrol got a bone and dug a hole so far into the earth he now lives with a family in Sumatra. And he’s so strong he can lick any balls he wants. No one dares stop him.


The reporter with no credibility asked the researcher who has no credibility if humans should take resveratrol. He said no. He wasn’t worried that it would cause harm, but there are no studies showing it would work in humans, and there was some doubt about delivering the chemical in pill form before it broke down and became ineffective. Then the reporter with no credibility asked the researcher with no credibility if he takes it himself. He said yes.


About thirty seconds later I found a web site that sells that shit and bought several pallets of it. I bought a brand called Longevinex because some other sources with no credibility said they might have solved the problem of keeping it from breaking down in pill form.


I’ve been taking the resveratrol for a few months. I don’t know if it’s working, but I got rid of my car. Now I go places by taking huge hops. And when people ask me questions I can’t answer, I kill them by squeezing their heads. Most important, I’ll add about thirty years to my life. Thirty years should bring me to the point where medical science can cure just about anything. If my arm falls off, I’ll inject some stem cells into the stump and grow a new one before dinner.


By then, there will be a lot of old people like me who refuse to die. They will also refuse to work. The immortal slackers will want to collect their pensions and Social Security until the sun turns into a cold dark thing about the size of a penny. No one foresaw immortality. Pension funds and Social Security are calculated on the hope that you will live an unhealthy lifestyle and take a dirt nap at 76. There simply won’t be enough money for all of the immortals.


So whose job will it be to kill all the senior citizens? Someone has to do it. You can bet that the people with jobs won’t want to hand over their paychecks to the lazy-ass immortals that do nothing but hop around town and talk about the squirrels on their lawn.


That’s why you should buy stock in life insurance companies. Those bastards will save a ton of money by never paying a claim. You can bet they’ll work some exclusion language into the policy that says something like “Does not include immortals that hop around town talking about squirrels until some guy working in a cubicle decides to take matters into his own hands.”


By the way, I remind you not to get your medical or financial advice from cartoonists.

Nostrildumbass Rides Again
In a previous post, I discussed the possibility of NYC mayor Mike Bloomberg running for president. One of the appealing things about him is his lack of blind party loyalty. He’s been a Democrat. He’s been a Republican. Recently he left the Republican Party. People speculate that it’s a first step toward running for president as an independent.


If he runs, here’s my prediction. I think you’ll see a web-oriented campaign, the likes of which you’ve never seen. I think it will redefine the campaign process. In particular, I predict his web site will do what no political web site has done before: Show both sides of the issues.


Politicians are advocates. They minimize the other side of the argument and exaggerate the wisdom of their own side. This is a fancy way of saying they are liars. That’s how politics works. The best liar wins. As long as our choices are limited to liars, we’ll keep electing them and wondering what went wrong.


Bloomberg strikes me as 80% businessman and 20% politician. A good businessman knows how to bring the opinions of his “customers” into the process. I don’t think he’ll minimize any side of an argument. As a businessman, he’ll highlight the pros and cons (via the website) and then tell you why he picked the side he picked. It will be rational and fact-based government.


Bloomberg could be the first presidential candidate immune from the idiocy of the “flip-flop” accusation. A normal brain is supposed to change opinions if the information or the situation changes. The first candidate to make that case to the voters will seem to be the only sane person running.


I don’t have enough faith in the voters to believe an independent can get elected president. But I wouldn’t be surprised if he finished a strong second to the tall guy with the good hair (Romney).

Old Fashioned Words
People mock me for referring to my athletic footwear as “sneakers.” Apparently that is an old fashioned term. I am told the correct term is “tennis shoes” even if the athletic shoes in question are not designed for use on a tennis court. This seems wrong. If my athletic shoes allow me to “sneak” someplace without making noise, and are unsuitable for playing tennis, I say they should be called sneakers. 


I was reminded of this the other day at the movies. The theater asks customers to silence their “cell phones.” This already seems old fashioned to me. I only own one phone. It’s in my left front pocket all the time. It’s my home phone, my work phone, and my cell phone. All of those terms will be old fashioned in your lifetime. Your kids will simply have a “phone.”


Do you remember when computers were “multimedia”? That word went away as soon as every computer could handle sound and video. The descriptor “high definition” will evaporate in about ten years too. And you won’t have to talk about “downloading” music because that’ll be the only way to get it.


Recently a friend joked about going to the library to help with his son’s school project. He said it felt like going back in time, to pre-Internet days. I wonder if libraries have an expiration date on them. I’m guessing yes.


I also wonder when the “e-“ will disappear from e-mail. I’m trying to remember the last time I wrote the kind of letter that requires a stamp. I’m guessing it was about seven years ago. I don’t even check my physical mailbox daily. I only check it when I think it might be too full for the mailman to stuff more crap in there.


Do you have any soon-to-be-old-fashioned words to add?

China Does Quality
Did you hear about the former head of China’s food and drug administration? He took bribes to approve bogus pharmaceuticals, some of which killed people. China just sentenced Zheng to death.


Now THAT is a country that’s serious about quality control.


http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/29/health/main2860989.shtml


It looks like the main reason he got the death penalty is that he was bad for business. China doesn’t want to be seen as a country with poor quality control. They figured that being seen as a country that kills thieving political assholes would be seen as more of a positive thing.


They were right!


My immediate reaction to the story was “Why can’t we be more like China?”


Generally, I’m not a huge fan of the death penalty, for purely practical reasons:


1. Death sentences costs tax payers more than life sentences because of the lengthy automatic appeals.
2. Sometimes we convict the wrong guy, as DNA testing has shown.
3. I’d be amazed if the death penalty deterred anyone who was in the frame of mind of committing a heinous crime.


But I’d be willing to make an exception for politicians that take bribes. That sort of behavior threatens the integrity of the entire system. The value is in the signal it sends to the citizens about what the government will tolerate. There’s nothing ambiguous about the death penalty. If I were a Chinese citizen, I’d feel a lot better about the quality of my food and drugs going forward.


I still think democracy is the best form of government. But the Chinese are closing that gap fast.

Global Warming – Part 4
Having worked my way through the global warming issue, starting from 100% ignorance and advancing to somewhere in the top 10% of what the uninformed public knows about the topic, thanks to lots of help from your comments, I have come to the following plateau of understanding.


1. The earth is getting warmer, and human activity is an important part of it. I base this conclusion on the lack of credible peer reviewed work to the contrary and the mountain of work that confirms human-induced warming. While individual studies might be wrong, it’s extremely unlikely the entire field has been so thoroughly duped.


2. There is plenty of bullshit on both sides of the issue. The people arguing that humans are not causing relatively rapid rises in temperatures are under-informed, misinformed, or suffering from bad thinking and bad analogies.


3. The people who are well-informed about global warming are overstating the case by conflating the well-studied fact of human-created warming with the less-than-certain predictions of what happens because of the extra warming. And there’s a tendency to leave out the “why I might be wrong” parts of the argument. I call that bullshit.


4. The people who say global warming is irrelevant because we should all be recycling and using less fossil fuel for other reasons anyway don’t understand the size of the problem. Ordinary conservation in the industrialized nations won’t put a dent in it.


5. The people predicting likely doom because of global warming have not made their case. Humans are incredibly adaptive. And technological breakthroughs happen in steps, not predictable straight lines. Every other predicted type of global doom hasn’t happened because of human resourcefulness. No climate model can predict human resourcefulness.


6. Some say that even a small chance of worldwide catastrophe is worth the “insurance” of working to reduce the risk to zero, even at astronomical expense. But how small is a “small” risk? And how does the risk of global warming stack up to the other global risks for which we could use our limited resources? That’s where I hit the wall on my understanding of the issue.


My best guess for the future is that global warming continues, conservation doesn’t take hold in the less developed countries because of simple economics and corruption, and something “big” has to be done by the richest players. I think that something “big” will be mammoth carbon dioxide “scrubbers” to clean the atmosphere. It’s technically possible, but not economical. The economical part will either be solved or become a moot point if the alternative is global annihilation.


The Y2K scenario is a bad analogy to global warming but it’s instructive in one minor way. When there’s a certain deadline, humans can meet it more effectively than you might think. Global warming hasn’t given us the two-minute warning yet. When it does, I like our odds.

Global Warming – Part 3
How good are the computer models that predict global warming? I previously linked to this article, in which the author argues that complicated climate models are reliable:


http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/climate-change/dn11649


The author makes three main points:


1. The best models can predict the past.


2. Some models have predicted the future.


3. Computer models are successfully used in the stock market.


Predicting the past doesn’t impress me much. There are no surprises in the past, so you can get the inputs right. Getting the inputs right seems like the hardest part.


I’m also not too surprised that some models have predicted the near future. The earth is clearly getting warmer. If a dozen climatologists build a dozen climate models, some of them are going to get the temperature about right, especially in the near term. I’d be interested in how many models got it right about the past but wrong about the near future. Without that context, I can’t form an opinion.


In a different part of the same article, the author points out that a significant wildcard is the amount of aerosols produced in the future. Between 1940 and 1970, industrial activity produced so many aerosols that it cooled the climate despite rising carbon dioxide. Most industrialized countries cleaned up their emissions and the effect reversed. But China and India are starting to pump substantial amounts into the atmosphere. And the occasional big volcano can do the same thing. It seems to me you could change the result of your climate model by what you assume about aerosols, and that’s unpredictable.


http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/climate-change/dn11639


How about those computer models being used in the stock market? There’s some truth to that, for some special cases where there is inefficiency in the market. But realistically, if computer models picked stocks much better than a monkey with a dartboard, Warren Buffet would have all of your money by now, not just most of it.


The stock trades you make with a computer model will either beat the averages or not. Some computer model is bound to work at least some of the time, until it doesn’t. I’m not sure the climatologists should use stock trading models as their gold standard.


For the record, I think it’s entirely possible that human activity is warming the earth, we can predict its consequences, and those consequences are dire. I just think that case hasn’t been made to my personal satisfaction. I’m bothered by the fact that the people trying to save me are feeding me nuggets of potentially useful facts buried in huge loads of what looks and smells like bullshit.

Peer Review
Peer review in science is a good thing, in the sense that it works better than any other process you can think of. But how well does it work? Dilbert Blog reader Jeff points to this link about the limits of peer review.


http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band88/b88-4.html


The article fits my preconceived notions quite well. Assuming scientists are human beings, it seems to me that most peer reviewers would fall into one of these categories:


1. Asshole
2. Biased egomaniac
3. Nice person who doesn’t want to make people feel bad
4. Too busy to put any quality thought into it
5. Person with low self-esteem who doesn’t want others to succeed in his or her field
6. Coward who doesn’t want to rock the boat


I suppose some scientists have plenty of free time, no biases, and would be happy to see colleagues succeed beyond their own careers. But seriously, how many of those scientists could there be? I don’t know any non-scientists who could fit that description.


Still, I assume peer review works well enough for killing the worst ideas. I don’t have a better idea for evaluating science. It’s just important to keep things in perspective.


[Update: Here's a link to an even better article on peer review: http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1963 -- Scott]


[Update 2: Reader Winston points out this article debunking the notion that scientists ever generally thought an ice age was imminent: http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/ -- Scott]

Global Warming – Part 2
Apparently the two most common points of view on global warming, ferociously held, are these:


1. The earth is warming up.
2. The earth is warming up.


A few people have figured out that the only real question is whether people can or should do anything to try and slow the warming. Meanwhile, everyone else is counting icebergs and polar bears and imagining they are contributing to the debate.


The question of whether people are the cause of global warming, or part of the cause, is somewhat irrelevant. It doesn’t really matter if the problem is caused by cars or farting cows or rotting leaves. If the warming is going to threaten life as we know it, the only important questions are these:


1. Are we sure global warming will cause more bad than good?
2. Realistically, can we do anything to stop it?
3. Would the costs of stopping it be more or less than the benefits?


I’m fairly certain the answer to all three questions is “Beats the shit out of me.”


Some say the cost of slowing global warming would be several hundred trillion dollars, plus stunting the development of poor countries and dooming them to another century of grinding poverty and related health problems. That’s because the poor countries are the ones that will need to burn lots of coal and oil in order to develop. You and I can slap solar panels on the roof. But Mubutu the goat herder will have to continue getting his dental work from a guy with a rock. If he tries to build a steel plant, life on earth will cease.


If we accept the high expense of combating global warming, and it turns out we can’t make a dent in it no matter what we do, or the earth cools on its own for reasons we didn’t forsee, we’ve really screwed the pooch. It would be the biggest fuckup of all time.


Humans are wired to put more weight on avoiding potential huge fuckups than to pursue nebulous benefits to future generations. I see no hope of that changing. So regardless of how sure the scientists are that human activity is causing most of the global warming, it won’t have much impact on policies.


The other thing that struck me about the debate on global warming is that both sides are so obviously full of shit. I presume there is lots of truth buried beneath the steaming mounds of manure, but I’m not dedicated enough to dig it out. For example, a few readers pointed me to this article on the myths about global warming, as an example of a shining light of clarity:


http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/dn11462


But I had the opposite reaction when I read it. It just looked like propaganda to me, independent of the question of whether humans are causing global warming.


For homework, read the 26 myths and see if you can find the glaring omissions and biases. In the first myth, about human contributions to carbon dioxide being too tiny to matter, the author points out how much carbon dioxide comes from natural sources, such as rotting vegetation and oceans. What’s missing is any kind of assurance that science can measure that stuff with any useful precision. Maybe it can. Maybe it can’t. I have to think it’s hard to know how much stuff is rotting at what rate all over the globe. Where’s my link to an article about peer reviewed studies showing we can measure that stuff well enough for this purpose?


The author mentions the list of 60 “leading scientists” who signed a petition asking for Canada to review its decision on the Kyoto protocol. He points out that “many, if not most, of the 60 signatories are not actively engaged in studying climate change: some are not scientists at all and at least 15 are retired.” That’s fair. What’s missing is how many people on the list ARE active scientists in the appropriate fields. Is it two? Is it twenty? Twenty dissenters who are active in the field and willing to put their necks on the line seems like a lot to me. Two doesn’t. I’d like to know the number. An unbiased article might have said, “At least 15 of those scientists are totally credible and up to date on the science.”


Clearly there is plenty of bullshit on both sides of the debate. I’d like some clarity before I decide whether or not to kill Mubutu to save my beach house.

Global Warming – Part 1
People keep asking me to blog about global warming. I have so far avoided the topic for four reasons:


1. My profound ignorance on the topic.
2. My inability to evaluate the claims on both sides.
3. My preference of not being scared shitless about drowning.
4. My observation that scary predictions about the future rarely happen.


This is one of the many, many cases where ignorance has utility. I can’t do much to stop global warming, but I can do plenty to ignore it and not worry myself into a coma before I drown in melted glacier water.


Anyway, recently I got dragged into the debate by a comment left by reader Bruce Harrison. He objected to a prior post in which I noted our President was ignoring the consensus of scientists on the question of global warming. I called this sort of behavior stupid.


Bruce countered by calling me arrogant and ignorant. So far, his opinion was spot on, so I figured it was worth seeing what else he had to say. This led me down a path of random, unreliable fact-gathering that I like to call “research.”


As I already noted, I’m not qualified to evaluate the science behind global warming. The best I can do is to evaluate the media reports of that science. Here’s the path my “research” took me.


In round one, I accepted the majority opinion of leading scientists, that global warming is happening, and that a big cause of that warming is all the frickin’ people and their energy-gobbling ways. A good representation of all those scientists is here on Wikipedia.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change


But where are the dissenters? Bruce Harrison pointed me to this web site where thousands of scientists signed a petition saying global warming is not caused by people.


http://www.oism.org/pproject/s33p357.htm


Hmmm. That seems like a body blow to the idea that the science of global warming is settled. Then I noticed a follow-up comment on this blog by reader rokusan, who pointed to a web story about how the petition by the dissenters is not credible.


http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Oregon_Institute_of_Science_and_Medicine


At this point in my “research” I was back to thinking the majority of scientists are probably right. You can find dissenters for any view. You can even find thousands of them if you put some effort into it. So I discounted the petition by the dissenters.


Then I looked at the next link provided by Bruce. It’s for a video called "The Great Global Warming Swindle." I figured this would be good for a laugh, kind of like a creationist museum with cowboys riding dinosaurs. It’s a long video, so I’ll summarize it after showing this link.


http://www.ksfo.com/goout.asp?u=http://leaningstraightup.com/2007/03/11/the-global-warming-swindle-video/.


The gist of the video is that Al Gore and the scientists got the cause-and-effect thing backwards. There is a strong correlation between carbon dioxide levels and temperatures throughout history, but temperature increases come first by hundreds of years. Warmer weather heats the oceans and produces more carbon dioxide.


So what causes the extra heat? According to the experts on the video, the data says it’s clearly the sun. When the sun has extended periods with lots of sun spots, it raises the temperature on Earth a bit. That warms the oceans, which releases more carbon dioxide.


According to the video, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by humans is miniscule, and our industrialization doesn’t even correlate with changes in Earth’s temperatures. In summary:


Sun = huge hot thing that keeps fucking with us


SUV = drive all you want


As I’ve noted, and will continue to note, I’m not qualified to judge the science of global warming. But if you ask me to judge the persuasiveness of competing media accounts, I’d say the argument against people causing global warming is the strongest.


The video also does a surprisingly good job of explaining why the majority of scientists are politically and financially motivated to get the science of global warming wrong. I can’t judge the accuracy of that assertion, but the video is exceptional in its persuasiveness.


I expect the comments to this post to include convincing evidence that global warming is caused by people. If you plan to do that, watch the video first. It probably addresses most of your points.


Go.


[Update: It took about ten minutes for reader Chris Graham to post this link debunking the video "The Great Global Warming Swindle.": http://www.durangobill.com/Swindle_Swindle.html. Obviously I am unqualified to judge either the video or the debunking to it, but the last thing I read alway seems the most persasive.]

900 Comments and Counting
I didn’t anticipate the volume of suggestions I’d get to yesterday’s post about my restaurants. I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised. I’ve yet to meet a human being who isn’t a restaurant expert by virtue of his or her experience at eating.


I’m actually going to read all the comments, as will my restaurant managers. I can tell there’s a lot of good stuff nestled within the calls for nudity and midget wrestling. But I thought I’d take a moment to comment on some of the suggestions.


Many people pointed out that the quality of your food and service determine the size of your restaurant business. I used to think that too. To my surprise, those two factors are surprisingly far down the list, at least in my local area.


Obviously the food and service have to be good enough to support the price you charge. But most places achieve that goal. Around here, the restaurants with the best food, or even the best value, don’t have more business because of it. You think they do, but they don’t.


Locally, familiarity is the biggest predictor of success. Italian and Mexican themed restaurants are typically packed regardless of food or service. Everyone knows they can find something on the menu they will understand and enjoy. Indian and Thai restaurants are less familiar and they struggle no matter what they do right. My two favorite restaurants locally (Indian and Thai) are typically 75% empty.


The local restaurant that is generally considered to have the best food in the area is full most of the time. From your armchair, you might assume the food quality is the reason. You’d be wrong. The restaurant is full because it’s tiny. Both of my restaurants have more customers. There’s some sort of statistical smoothing effect that causes people to spread their eating around more evenly than you’d think. We can predict our level of business on any Tuesday night to a degree of precision that seems odd. There’s never a day when, for no reason in particular, a thousand people all decide to eat at the same place. Restaurants get nearly their baseline “share” just by existing, presumably because people like variety.


When we designed the Dublin restaurant, it was intentionally twice the size of the first, in anticipation of filling the banquet area with events. It’s the banquet and event portion that doesn’t fill itself just by doing things right. I pay rent on that space whether it’s full or not.


When asked about the most important factor for a restaurant’s success, experts often pick lighting. Your first inclination is to laugh that off as absurd, because you’ve probably never made a restaurant decision based on lighting. But if you look at the restaurants that are doing well without being Italian or Mexican or tax cheats or a chain, they generally have excellent lighting. Everything, including your date, looks better with the right lighting. And that can be enough to make you remember the food and service as being better than they were. I pay attention to restaurant lighting, and find it a far better predictor of success than food or service. (I’m working on my restaurant’s lighting too.)


Price is obviously a big factor in people’s restaurant decisions. But unless you are a chain, or a tax-cheating family restaurant, you can’t compete on price. Our niche is the “nice night out” crowd for dinner, and the “business lunch” during the day, where a few extra dollars for a more special experience makes sense. The Cheesecake Factory is a great business model, but if you take your wife there for your 25th wedding anniversary, you might not reach your 26th.


People ask me why I’d want to be involved in the restaurant business. This is why. It’s surprisingly fascinating.

Oh Great Blog Brain
I can’t help noticing that the comments on this blog are like a giant virtual brain. It’s hard to imagine any question I could ask that would stump you, collectively.


You might say Google is like a giant brain too, but it’s missing something. While Google’s algorithms are impressive, sometimes a question requires the “x-factor” that only another human, or collection of humans can grok. For example, if I asked Google what is more manly – a lamp or a pillow – I would get no useful answer. But the great Blog Brain would tell me the correct answer (lamp).


I’m going to test the Great Blog Brain with a little question that has been stumping me. I’m sure a Google search would come up empty because the answer requires intuition and personal experience and marketing savvy.


Here’s the situation. I own two restaurants locally. (See www.staceyscafe.com). One of the two restaurants (Stacey’s at Waterford) is in a neighborhood where about 12 new restaurants have opened in the past few months. A Cheesecake Factory and a PF Chang also opened just down the road. (Those are large chains, the equivalent of Wal*mart for restaurants, with the same impact on competition.) As competition increases dramatically, the smaller non-chain restaurants look for new ways to stand out.


Stacey’s at Waterford features a separate banquet room for about 50 people. The ambiance is “casual upscale” and the food is what we call California cuisine. I’ve been trying to come up with a brilliant idea to create events (as opposed to waiting for events to contact us) to fill the banquet room, or even the main restaurant.


In the past, we’ve tried comedy, live music, wine events, family nights, and various “get-something-free” promotions. They have little impact on business. And they require advertising for each event. In our perfect world, we’d find some sort of evergreen event that is self-organizing or involves existing organizations that meet on a regular basis over dinner or lunch.


So I ask you, Great Blog Brain, what is the best sort of event to fill a banquet room? (The restaurant has a large bar and cocktail area, and an extensive wine list, if that helps.)


You will be tempted to say the answer involves great food, service, value and location. That used to be enough. Now the problem is that there are more chairs than diners.


Advertising has no impact on restaurant business. We’ve tried newspapers, radio, direct mail, and magazine ads. They don’t even cause a blip in the baseline. Other restaurants have apparently discovered the same thing. So your answer should not rely on heavy ongoing ads.


I predict at least three excellent suggestions nestled within hundreds of snarky comments about celebrity restaurants.


Go.

Footwear Theory of Motivation
I once had a boss who shared his theory for seducing a woman. I’m not sure if it was genius or insanity. His theory is so simple it has to be one or the other. His two step secret to seduction:


1. Take her to your place.
2. Get her to take off her shoes.


That’s it.


His observation, after years of playboy behavior, is that a woman who takes off her shoes at your place isn’t planning to put them back on until morning. If she doesn’t take them off, she’s mentally prepped for a quick escape.


You might wonder if removing shoes causes the sex or it’s simply a sign of comfort that predicts it. Either way, it’s good to know. I leave you with that question and move to a related one I discovered on my own.


Years ago I discovered that I could put myself in any mood by my choice of footwear. For example, no matter how tired I was, putting on tennis shoes immediately put me in the mood for working out. Putting on my work shoes put me in a business frame of mind. Going barefoot relaxed me. And so on.


A year ago I was taking dance lessons to prepare for my wedding. I wore tuxedo-quality shoes to the lessons because I wanted to match the look and feel of the wedding dance. After a few months of lessons, putting on the shoes was enough to totally put me in the dancing mood. The before and after feelings were quite distinct.


And so I have generalized these observations to what I call the Footwear Theory of Motivation. It states that you can put anyone in the mood for anything by the right choice of footwear.


As silly as the Footwear Theory of Motivation sounds, it has plenty of scientific backing. On some level, it’s not much different from Pavlov’s research on dogs.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov


If you always wear the same type of footwear in the same situations, your body learns to automatically adjust to that situation when the shoes go on (or off). It would be surprising if the Footwear Theory of Motivation did NOT work.


The only question is the size of the effect. I think it’s huge.

Trillion Dollar Idea
Have you heard of an online service for kids called Webkinz? It’s like a cross between cocaine and puppies. Kids can’t resist it. It’s frickin’ brilliant.


Before you use the Webkinz service, you have to buy a stuffed animal that comes with a code. You use that code to activate an animated character in an online world that looks like your stuffed animal. The brilliant part is that your online critter will become sick if you don’t regularly visit and care for it. Somehow this makes kids emotionally invested.


Kids can earn fake money by playing games on the system. That money goes toward caring for their online creatures, including buying furniture and so on. Kids love it. But I think kids aren’t the biggest market for this sort of thing.


I think single women would want an online boyfriend they could totally control. But here’s the hook: The online boyfriend is a “project.” If you don’t sign into the system regularly, your online boyfriend will start dressing with clothes from the 80’s, smoking, gambling, staying out late, and flirting with other women.


It’s the “owner’s” job to make the virtual boyfriend eat right, exercise, look for a job, and trim his nose hair. If he scratches his crotch or passes gas during an online dinner party, he gets no virtual sex for a week.


The women could earn fake online money by playing games just like in the Webkinz model. For example, imagine a Tetris-type game where articles of clothing fall from above and you have to assemble them into coordinated outfits before they reach the ground. You can’t tell me that wouldn’t be a hit.


Here are some more online game ideas for the virtual boyfriend site:


- Quickly identify which movie at the Cineplex would make a human feel the worst. Send the online boyfriend to watch it.


- Send the online boyfriend to the drugstore for you and try to assemble a basket of items that is the most embarrassing.


- Make the online boyfriend carry a purse through a tough neighborhood without being beaten to death.


- How about a game set in a Mexican restaurant where all the tables have candles? The object is to navigate your online boyfriend around the tables and to the Men’s room without him tooting too near the candles and setting the other diners aflame.


Do you have any more game ideas?

Define “Free” Speech
Suppose there was a hit song that caused 80% of its listeners kill themselves. Should that song be banned, or would you argue that free speech is more important?


I think most people would take the practical approach. We already have some minor constraints on free speech. You can’t yell “fire” in a crowded movie theater. You can’t defame someone in public. It would be no big deal to ban one particular song if the alternative was the death of millions.


What if the song killed fewer people? Would you ban a hit song that’s loved around the world if there was no doubt, statistically speaking, it would result in the death of ten people?


We have that situation now, except it’s not music. Every time the media makes a big deal about a high profile suicide there’s a 100% chance it inspires additional suicide.


http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/325/7377/1374


I first heard of this effect in the book “Influence,” by Robert B. Cialdini. The correlation between media reports of suicides and a spike in additional suicides is fairly clear. So when a big news outlet decides to run a story about a high profile suicide, there’s a near-certainty they are killing a few people to boost revenue. And they know it.


Do you have a problem with that?

This Explains Everything
I’ve often noted that all of the world’s problems are caused by people who apparently enjoy making other people miserable. I know it sounds like one of those cynical observations I often make for humorous purposes, but I mean it literally. There’s no other explanation for why people put so much effort into making others miserable.


Now there’s evidence to back my theory. According to recent research, people with high testosterone (let’s call them assholes) literally get pleasure from making other people look unhappy.


http://www.ns.umich.edu/htdocs/releases/story.php?id=3209


I am sooooo jealous. Making other people unhappy is as easy as, well, eating and farting.


Unfortunately for me, I’m wired the other way. I’m only happy if I can make other people happy. And that’s obviously impossible, because as soon as you give someone what he or she wants, he or she immediately want more. It’s one of those “can’t get there from here” situations.


But pissing people off? That’s simple.


I imagine myself stranded with an asshole on an otherwise deserted island. I’d be trying to increase my happiness by pleasing the asshole. I’ll be all, “Can I build you a thatch hut”? Meanwhile, the asshole would be getting all of his happiness by frequently pointing to the horizon and yelling, “Look, a ship! Nah, just kidding!”


A week later, when I’ve finished building a thatch hut for the asshole, he’d look at it and say, “Was this built by a monkey? Where’s the formal dining room? You can’t expect me to eat all of my meals at the breakfast nook. Speaking of breakfast, I ate all of your coconuts while you were working.”


My point is that I shouldn’t waste my time complaining about the war in Iraq. All I need to do is increase my levels of testosterone until I can enjoy the unhappiness of others.

Fairness
I often laugh when someone declares a thing to be fair. Fairness is a funny illusion. It’s one of our most useful illusions, but it’s an illusion nonetheless.


Imagine trying to “fairly” divide ten identical marbles between two kids. You could give five marbles to each kid, wave your arms and declare it fair. The kids would probably agree with this arrangement. The illusion of fairness works.


Is five marbles apiece actually fair?


Don’t you need to know how many marbles each kid already owns? What if one kid has a thousand and the other has none? The marginal utility of an extra marble is much higher for the marble-poor kid.


Doesn’t their different level of enthusiasm for marbles come into play? If you think about it, you’re trying to be fair with their happiness, not their marbles. What if one kid loves marbles five times more than the other? In that case, the fair thing to do is give most of the marbles to the kid who doesn’t enjoy them as much. He needs more marbles to obtain the same level of happiness as the marble lover gets with one. Of course that solution would cause one kid to melt down because it wouldn’t have the illusion of fairness.


Even the simplest example of fairness falls apart when you put it under scrutiny. Luckily, people are morons, so they imagine fairness where none exists. Otherwise nothing would ever get done.


I was thinking of fairness the other day when considering my next car purchase. I figure I need to do my part to conserve energy. I considered buying a fuel-efficient car that would give me no joy whatsoever. It’s the fair thing to do. We all need to pitch in.


Then I remembered I’ve never procreated. That’s a huge energy savings. When you create new humans, they start leaving the lights on, driving, eating, pooping, and doing all sorts of energy-inefficient things. By not creating any new humans, I’m saving a huge amount of energy!


I walk to work. That saves a lot of fuel too. If you consider my total energy drain on the planet, I could own a small fleet of gas-guzzlers and still be greener than 95% of the citizens of the United States. That seems fair to me.


If you were the judge in this decision, and considered all the facts, would you give me a Hummer?

Chair Butt
This week in the Dilbert comic, Alice discovers she has a bad case of chair butt. United Media, the company that syndicates Dilbert, rejected the first version I submitted. It looked like this:


070424_alice_chair_buttocks


My editors thought the pose looked too provocative. They requested I redraw Alice in less of a “mount me” position. I argued that in the context of a medical exam, no one would interpret her pose as sexual. This argument did not carry the day. So I went back to the drawing board with the instructions to make it look “more medical.”


At this point in the story I should pause to confess I did not attend medical school. I don’t know exactly how a trained physician would examine a patient for signs of chair butt. So I took an educated guess and resubmitted the comic. Here’s a peek.070424_alice_chair_buttocks_2_cropp




Although my editors have no formal medical training, they were nonetheless certain my depiction of a chair butt exam was inaccurate. I went back to the drawing board a third time and drew the version that was accepted and ran in newspapers. Here it is.


070424_alice_chair_buttocks_3


What I learned from this experience is that being a doctor takes more than common sense and a willingness to look at unattractive naked people. I don’t know how much more it takes, but I intend to keep drawing comics until I find out.

Cool New Planet with a Shitty Name
Scientists discovered a planet 20.5 light years from here that seems to have the right stuff for sustaining life.


http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18293978/


The scientists named the planet Gliese 581 C, evidently to showcase the reason scientists can’t get laid. Science fiction writers all over the Earth are muttering, “Fuck you very much.” No one is going to buy a book titled “Escape From Gliese 581 C.”


And if we discover advanced life on that planet, what do we call them? It won’t be something easy like Martians, or Venutians. No, they will be Gliese 581 Csians – a name that practically demands we discriminate against them.


Seriously, don’t the discovering scientists have a neighbor or a friend who works in marketing? Watch me spend all of thirty seconds to come up with five better names for that bad boy. And I won’t even use New Earth or Earth V2.0. Time me.


Vektron


Albutoral


Skype


Androgena


Heedro


Done! See? How hard was that?


We don’t know if the planet already has life. I suggest we play God and put some there. 20.5 light years is too long for human travel, but we could place some hearty bacteria and whatnot in a probe and fire it in that direction. If there isn’t already life on Gliese 581 C, the bacteria and whatnot can evolve into zebras and Creationists over time. If there already is life on the planet, our bacteria and whatnot will probably infect them and wipe out their civilization. So we might want to put a Mars license plate on the probe.


Infotainment questions for the day:


1. Do we have the technology to seed that planet with life?


2. How do we know the Gliese 581 Csians didn’t seed life on Earth?


It seems to me that we now have a falsifiable hypothesis for Intelligent Design on Earth. My hypothesis is that it came from Gliese 581 C. I call that science. We should teach it in schools.


Go.

Perfection
Something has been bothering me about the Don Imus controversy. On the surface, it’s a case where a mistake was made, and after that, everyone involved eventually did the right thing.


- People communicated their feelings in appropriate ways.


- Imus eventually acknowledged his mistake and apologized.


- Sponsors withdrew support for financial reasons.


- Imus’ employers listened to their employees, viewers, and sponsors, and fired Imus.


The young women on the Rutgers basketball team showed dignity and poise in a difficult situation. It was evident that they had good coaches and advisors, and they displayed a world-class grace under pressure.


So what was missing? How do you improve on a situation where, after the initial mistake, everyone seemed to do exactly the right thing?


What most impressed the world about the Rutgers athletes is the maturity of their response, and in particular how they went from a position of perceived powerless to a position of complete power through sheer force of character. It was beautiful in its way. And yet, something was missing.


Imus delivered his apology sincerely, and in person. The athletes accepted it. Days passed. Something is missing.


No reasonable person can fault the Rutgers team for the way they felt in this situation, nor the way they handled it. And nothing could have prepared them for the sort of power they acquired overnight. Their coaches and advisors had never been in this situation either. And while the athletes achieved greatness, how could any of them know how near to perfection they were? Their point had been made. The message had been delivered. What was missing?


Forgiveness.


They could have asked Imus’ employers to rehire him, and in so doing, shown the world the difference between greatness and perfection.

Fuel
Imagine you could make fuel out of poor people. The only downside is that the poor people have to be converted to a combustible liquid in the process. Imagine that although there are many alternatives to using poor people as fuel, those alternatives cost way more. In fact, the alternatives are so much more expensive, widespread use would impact your standard of living by about twenty percent.


Obviously using humans for fuel would be wrong and you wouldn’t do it. But I’m not done confusing your moral compass.


Now let’s say the people who are used as fuel are volunteers, of a sort. For every twenty people who volunteer to become SUV fuel, only one will be randomly selected. The other nineteen get a host of benefits including pensions and paid educations. Let’s say human fuel is so economical that one human converted to fuel pays for the benefits to the other nineteen. And the one poor person fuels an entire town’s energy needs for a year.


In this scenario, you’d be powering your car with liquefied poor people, but your conscience would be cleared by the knowledge they all volunteered. It’s a free country. They took the chance of being one of the nineteen lucky ones, but it didn’t work out. Some volunteered because they thought it was their best chance for upward mobility. Some thought it was their patriotic duty. But it was their decision. No one forced them.


Let’s say the politicians argue that in the long run, this policy of using poor people for fuel will save lives. The thinking is that we’ll eventually develop other fuel sources, but for now we need the strong economy to pay for health care and a strong national defense against terrorists and whatnot. All of the volunteers are hailed as heroes.


Under those conditions would you use poor people to fuel your car?


Bonus question: Are you already doing something close to that?

Judging Art
People think art is subjective. Sometimes you hear opinions such as this:


“Those Harry Potter books suck.”


Logically, if you don’t personally like Harry Potter books, knowing full well that a quarter of a BILLION people do, it’s an indication that you might be abnormal, and not necessarily in a good way. Yet no one ever says, “I don’t enjoy Harry Potter books because, evidently, there’s something disturbingly abnormal about my brain. Although scientists say human and chimp DNA only differs by 2%, with me, it’s probably a lot less.”


We’re funny that way. We assume our personal preferences are the standard by which all art should be judged. I think the best way to judge the quality of art is by how well the artist achieves his objectives, whatever those might be.


Take the Garfield comic strip, for example. The creator, Jim Davis, set out years ago to create a massively popular comic strip. That was the goal of his art. He has succeeded for decades. When art achieves its goal, it has to be considered great. Sure, Garfield doesn’t make you dance or cry or fall in love. It doesn’t even amuse most adult males. So what? You can’t judge art against objectives it never held. If you judge it against the standard it seeks to achieve, it’s every bit the equal of the Mona Lisa. Likewise for the movie Borat and the TV show South Park.


Now consider the movie Titanic. It was a huge commercial success, but I have a hard time imagining the director’s artistic goal was to make the viewers feel as if someone put their dogs to sleep. Yet that’s what it did. As a business venture, Titanic was brilliant. It sold a lot of tickets. From the perspective of art, I doubt the artist’s objectives and the result lined up, unless they were sadists.


That’s how I judge art. Your mileage may vary.

Deja Comic
Yes, today’s Dilbert comic (Saturday) is a repeat. Here’s the scoop.


I submit my comics a month or so in advance, then forget about them. Yesterday I got a call from my syndication company, United Media, alerting me that the comic scheduled for today makes a casual reference to serial killing.


Obviously this is exceptionally bad timing. The average reader doesn’t know how far in advance the comics are submitted, and it would look cruel, possibly intentional, given recent events.


One option was to alert client newspapers and give them the option of running the comic or replacing it with a repeat. I decided to go further and ask all of the newspapers to run the repeat. Some papers did not get enough notice to make the change. Comics are sometimes typeset in advance, depending on what technology the newspaper company uses. So I’m in for a bumpy ride today. Wish me luck.


I apologize for any bad feelings the comic might cause for anyone who sees it.

Asses and Free Will
It’s hard to please my readers. Some of you want more naughtiness in the service of humor, and some of you want more of my brain stimulating thought experiments. Rarely do I get an opportunity to combine ass-related content with the topic of free will. Today is special.


Recently, to my complete surprise, I got away with publishing this comic:


070327_hole_in_the_ground


But my syndication company, United Media, balked at this next one and sent me back to the drawing board because it was too explicit.


070329_ashtray_does_research_2


I resubmitted it with the most explicit part of the third panel clipped off. That strategy worked. The comic ran and no one complained, as far as I know.


070329_ashtray_does_research_2_2


This is a perfect segue into the topic of free will, in the sense that I’m an ass who can’t stop himself from publishing the following link. It describes some experiments that a-a-a-almost completely prove that free will is an illusion.


http://www.ft.com/cms/s/81bc32e4-d5e3-11db-99b7-000b5df10621.html


What amused me most about the article is that the best argument it cites in favor of free will comes from philosopher John Searle. From the article:


“He is puzzled by why, if we have no free will, we have this peculiar conscious experience of decision-making. If, as neuroscience currently suggests, it is purely an illusion, then ‘evolution played a massive trick on us.’ But this ‘goes against everything we know about evolution. The processes of conscious rationality are such an important part of our lives, and above all such a biologically expensive part of our lives’ that it seems impossible they ”play no functional role at all in the life and survival of the organism”.


Is it my imagination, or is that the worst argument ever?


[Update: The illusion of free will helps make us happy. Otherwise, consciousness would feel like a prison. Happiness in turn improves the body's immune response. What more do you need from evolution? -- Scott]

April Fools Jokes
Sunday is April Fools Day. It’s time to scheme. I’ll tell you some of my favorite pranks. You tell me yours. There’s a good chance we’ll all get something new we can use. (Too bad it falls on Sunday this year. Maybe you can get some ideas for next year.)


A classic prank for the workplace involves the fake e-mail notice announcing that the phone company needs to clean the built-up dust out of the phone lines. Your e-mail should tell people to unplug their phones because a burst of concentrated air will be sent through the phone lines at a certain time, and if the phone is not unplugged, the cubicle will fill with dust.


One of the best practical jokes ever played on me took me years to figure out. I still don’t know who did it, but it was a beauty. It won’t work if your victim has caller ID, unless maybe you block your number. It works like this: Find someone who has two phones – say a work phone and a home phone. Pick a time when you know the target is near one of the phones and no one will answer the other. Call the phone that won’t be answered, then use three-way calling to call the phone that will be answered. When the target answers, say nothing but connect the three-way call. He’ll hear his own answering machine at home telling him to leave a message. Trust me when I say this will freak a person out. It took me about five years to figure out how my home answering machine called me at the office.


I haven’t seen this prank done, but I think it would work if you have a secretary who is unusually clueless about technology. Tell the secretary that some other department is out of copier paper and ask him/her to fax some blank pages, just enough to hold them until their paper shipment comes in.


Send a department-wide e-mail telling people that a once-in-a-century alignment of Pluto and Venus will cause gravity on earth to be 20% less for about five minutes starting at 9:47 AM. Suggest that people test the phenomenon by jumping straight up and down at that time. I stole this idea from here:


http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070329/od_afp/lifestyleaprilfoolmediaholidayoffbeat;_ylt=AoTVC4N.0t6cqXq9w25MVBkDW7oF


When I left my first job at a large bank, personal computers were so new that there was only one in the entire department. Everyone shared it. I was the only person who knew much about how computers worked. Before I left for another company, I wrote a program in Basic that started whenever the computer was booted. It offered a multiple choice test that had to be answered before the user could continue. The question was something like:


Scott Adams is a wonderful human being because of his…


a. Sex appeal
b. Gigantic brain
c. All of the above


It didn’t matter what the user picked. All answers worked. But the computer couldn’t be used until the quiz was completed. I heard later that no one ever figured out how to remove it, and the question was dutifully answered every morning when the computer was booted.


I heard this prank that happened in a typing class. (Or keyboarding class if you prefer.) The prankster switched keyboards with his victim and when she tried typing, he would type messages to her screen as if her computer was a sentient being. Apparently she started asking it for advice, thinking it might be God. This prank would work even better with a wireless keyboard. You could control your co-worker’s computer from across the next cube.


What’s your best prank?

The Boner Theory of Economics
The Boner Theory of Economics states that a man will accept $1 per hour less pay if he is guaranteed a boner on the job. Stated mathematically…


$1/hour = 1 boner


We can test the validity of this theory by seeing how well it predicts behavior.  For example, the Boner Theory of Economics predicts that eventually all shoe salespeople jobs will be filled by men with foot fetishes. The only reason it’s not completely true already is that the managers filling those jobs haven’t realized they are overpaying. I wonder how many interviews have gone like this:


Manager: “The job involves kneeling in front of women and touching their feet. Are you okay with that?”


Applicant: “Um…er…yes.”


Manager: “The pay is $10 per hour.”


Applicant: “I can only afford to pay you $8 per hour.”


Manager: “We pay you. You don’t pay us.”


Applicant: “Can we start over with the negotiating?”


The Boner Theory of Economics also predicts that in the long run – perhaps in a few hundred years – the military will be 100% gay men. This is the best case scenario for taxpayers because it will keep down costs, and recruiting will be easy.


Recruiter: “We can’t afford to give you body armor, but you’ll be surrounded by young, vital men who are a long way from home. Would you like a tour of the showers?”


Recruit: “Yes, but I can’t stand up right away.”


During the transition to the future all-gay armed forces, things will be awkward for the career soldiers who are hanging in there for a pension. You’ll hear this sort of exchange when they finally retire:


Soldier: “I was deployed in the desert for three years.”


Friend: “Are you gay?”


Soldier: “No, but thank goodness the guy who shared my tent was.”

What’s Your Permanent Age?
Here’s a fun question to ask people after a few drinks: What’s your permanent age?


I’ve observed that everyone has a permanent age that appears to be set at birth. For example, I’ve always been 42-years old. I was ill-suited for being a little kid, and didn’t enjoy most kid activities. By first grade I knew I wanted to be an adult, with an established career, car, house and a decent tennis game. I didn’t care for my awkward and unsettled twenties. And I’m not looking forward to the rocking chair. If I could be one age forever, it would be 42.


When I ask people about their permanent age, they usually beg it off by saying they don’t have one. But if you press, you always get an answer. And the age they pick won’t surprise you. Some people are kids all their lives. They will admit they are 12-years old. Other people have always had senior citizen interests and perspectives. If you’re 30-years old in nominal terms, but you love bingo and you think kids should stop wearing those big baggy pants and listening to hip-hop music, your permanent age might be 60.


Another way to divide people is by asking if they live in the present or the future. I live in the future. I don’t dwell on the past. I’m always thinking about what’s next. When I sit down for a movie – no matter how much I expect to like it – I always look at my watch and imagine it being over. My mood is mostly determined by my expectations of how tomorrow will be. This works for me because I’m an optimist, and the future can’t disappoint me in the present.


Other people live in the moment. If today isn’t just right, they believe today is a bad day. Tomorrow is too far away to influence how they feel today. That’s a good point of view as long as today is going well.


Some people are locked in the past; it sneaks into all of their conversations and colors their perceptions more than it should. They spend their lives either consciously or unconsciously trying to turn the future into the past. They tend to be unhappy.


So what age are you? And do you live in the past, present or future?

Happiness Formula Wiki
A helpful reader of The Dilbert Blog set up a wiki for The Happiness Formula I recently talked about.


http://happinessformula.pbwiki.com/


The password to edit it is "happy." Have at it. If you’re not familiar with the wiki concept, it allows anyone to edit the information. So if you know a lot about, for example, a good diet, you could contribute what you know to that branch of the tree. Please stick to information that has some basis in science.


One Dilbert Blog reader noted that current research shows that happiness causes success more than success causes happiness. That makes sense to me. There’s plenty of research about people having a baseline of happiness that doesn’t vary much with circumstances. And given that happy people are typically optimistic, energetic, and fun to work with, I can see how happiness would lead to success.


My experience has been that circumstances in my life will move me about 10% in either direction from my baseline of happiness. That can be the difference between happy and unhappy. On any given day, the swing might be much greater, but I always revert to the baseline – give or take 10% – once the unusual good or bad luck passes.


I think it’s fair to say that the Happiness Formula describes a way to get you to your own best happiness potential. I know people who are giggle-happy all day long, and I’m sure that’s beyond my genetic happiness potential.


Many of you pointed out that Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs is similar to the Happiness Formula. There’s a big overlap, but happiness is different from needs, and the Happiness Formula is more of a practical map.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs


One of the great things about my job is that I never know when I might wake up and be part of something that changes the world. I doubt the Happiness Formula wiki will change the world, but you have to admit that it has the potential to change some individuals.


That’s why today is a good day.

Big Trouble
The NY Times has an interesting article about translating the Koran. Apparently the literal word of God contains lots of words with multiple meanings. A good example is Chapter 4, Verse 34. According to the NY Times, “The verse says that a rebellious woman should first be admonished, then abandoned in bed, and ultimately “beaten” — the most common translation for the Arabic word “daraba” — unless her behavior improves.”


What about those other translations for “daraba”?


The story explains “There are at least 20 English translations of the Koran. “Daraba” has been translated as beat, hit, strike, scourge, chastise, flog, make an example of, spank, pet, tap and even seduce.”


You can see the big problem here: A good number of wives might enjoy being spanked, petted, tapped and even seduced. If any of those last four definitions are the ones Allah intended, it means big trouble for Muslim men. You’re going to get a lot of this:


Wife: “Hey, Abdul, I spray painted the Star of David on your Mercedes because I’m rebellious! Now God says you have to seduce me! I like chocolate!”


I think we can all agree that the funniest translation of “daraba” is tap. I can imagine the conversation between a Muslim man and his spiritual leaders:


Man “My wife gave away my golf clubs. What should I do?”


Spiritual Leader: “Dude, you gotta go home and tap that.”


After reading about the Koran’s multiple translation problems, I started wondering if the Islamic terrorists might be misinterpreting the Koran. Perhaps the holy book doesn’t say to kill the infidels at all. Perhaps the Arab word for kill has lots of other interpretations including idolize, adore, wax their backs, fellate, and sell oil below cost. Maybe the terrorists just picked the easiest one.


This gives me a good idea on how to stop terrorism. All we have to do is print about 10 billion Korans with one or two words about the infidels altered, list some famous Islamic scholar as the publisher, assassinate him so he can’t talk, and give away the books for free. It will take a while for anyone to notice the few altered words and get the word out. By then it will be too late. The altered Korans will outnumber the correct ones, and in time the more common interpretation will seem right. In this future world, the biggest complaint that infidels will have about Islamic terrorists will be “He was nice, but his beard tickled, if you know what I mean.”


Here’s a link to the NY Times article:

The Meaning of Meaning
Many of you read my previous post on the Happiness Formula and asked why “meaning” was the lowest priority. Others asked about the definition of meaning. I bring you answers.


Priority-wise, it simply makes sense to take care of yourself before you start searching for a higher meaning. You aren’t much good to anyone else if you’re unhealthy, a financial burden, or an emotional basket case. Fix yourself before you turn outward. It’s best for everyone.


So what does “meaning” mean?


When you serve a purpose larger than yourself, you experience the sensation of having meaning. There are plenty of larger purposes from which to choose: You can save the whales, feed the poor, shelter the homeless, march for peace, serve your notion of God, whatever. The details don’t matter.


If your reaction to my explanation of larger purposes was “none of that sounds interesting to me,” then you haven’t finished fixing yourself. When you do, you will automatically look outward. It’s how humans are wired. We survive because, on average, the people who manage to satisfy their personal needs are changed by it. They become seekers of meaning. They ask, “What’s next?”


I remember when Dilbert hit it big and it became clear that I would never again have to worry about money. It was a wonderful feeling, but it didn’t last. I went from happy to hollow with no warning. The first moment that I could afford any car I wanted, I lost interest in having a nice car. I simply couldn’t see the point, if there ever was one. Success is surprisingly disorienting.


One day, about ten years ago, I was alone in my office, sitting on the couch and reflecting on the fact that I had managed to become rich and famous in my dream job. For the first time in my life, I had no goals. And for a goal-oriented guy, that’s an empty feeling. Success was supposed to feel good and stay that way. But it tricked me. There was a huge hole in my soul. I sat in my office and sobbed.


Then the change happened. It wasn’t something I thought about. It wasn’t an indication that I am a good person or a bad person. It was just some sort of chemical reaction in my moist robot head. It was natural.


I turned outward.


And in so doing, bit by bit, I found meaning. I found ways to use my success to make the world a little bit better. It’s surprising how often the opportunity comes up. It ranges from personal favors to investment decisions to my choices to continue making a comic and a blog post for you every day.


I start work before most of you wake up because I’m a part of something larger than myself, and it feels good. I don’t work because I want more money. I work because it makes you happy, and that gives me meaning. And the extra money I make can be used to make other people happy too.


I measure my success by how many people would attend my funeral if I died tomorrow. I try to make sure that number grows every year. It’s a theoretical number, since I’m very healthy and plan to outlive all of you. But it’s the best measurement I can think of.


Don’t worry if you aren’t ready to serve a higher purpose. Fix yourself first. We’ll wait for you. You’ll know you’re ready when serving the higher purpose seems easier than not.

Happiness Formula
I fantasize about writing a book called The Happiness Formula. The idea would be to create a simple formula for troubleshooting your life and improving your happiness. On page one would be this top formula.


Happiness = health + money + social life + meaning


The rest of the book would be nested formulas that further explain each component of happiness. For example…


Health = sleep + diet + exercise


And then down another level…


Sleep = schedule + technique


And down another level until it starts getting practical…


Sleep Technique  = consistent bedtime and waking time + no reading or TV in bed + no booze or caffeine…


And so on.


To make the Happiness Formulas extra useful, the highest priorities would appear first (leftmost) in the formula. For example, in the top Happiness Formula (Happiness = health + money + social life + meaning), health is a higher priority than money, which is a higher priority than social life, etc.


I realize you’ll argue with my ranking of priorities and point out all the exceptions. For example, if you have no money, you can’t afford to be healthy. But the formula only shows priorities, not absolutes. Obviously you always need a source of money, but the priority list shows that you shouldn’t take a job with high pay that will significantly affect your health. It makes more sense to get healthy and then leverage your health to get the best job. (Healthy looking people land better jobs and are more highly paid. Their brains work better too, and they have more energy.)


I rank money higher than social life or meaning because once you have money, those other things are easier to get. For example, you won’t have much of a social life if you can’t afford to do anything. And you can’t make money if your health is a mess.


You might wonder how something like “money” can be broken down into a formula so easily that someone could just follow it to get more. I think it can be done.


Money = Income + investments


Investments = (See my 9-point investment plan below that has been endorsed by economists.)


Scott’s 9-Point Investment Plan


Do these steps in the order shown…
1. Make a will


2. Pay off your credit cards


3. Get term life insurance if you have a family to support


4. Fund your 401k to the maximum


5. Fund your IRA to the maximum


6. Buy a house if you want to live in a house and can afford it


7. Put six months worth of expenses in a money-market account


8. Take whatever money is left over and invest 70% in a stock index fund and 30% in a bond fund through any discount broker and never touch it until retirement


9. If any of this confuses you, or you have something special going on (retirement, college planning, tax issues), hire a fee-based financial planner, not one who charges a percentage of your portfolio


Part of the reason I don’t turn The Happiness Formula into a book is that it would only be about 20 pages long. Its power is in its brevity, and brevity is not rewarded in our economy. If the best book in the world was only 20 pages long, no one would buy it. They’d stand in Borders and read it cover to cover.


So I won’t be writing that book. Maybe it needs to be a wiki project.

Oh Deer
Did you hear about the Wisconsin man who is charged with having sex with a dead deer that he found in a ditch?


http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1122061deer1.html


His defense was that the deer was already dead, so it wasn’t technically an “animal” when the sex happened. The judge disagreed and ruled that a dead deer is still an animal.


This decision sets a dangerous precedent. By the judge’s reasoning, any guy who gets aroused while wearing leather pants has – in the strictest legal terms – his wiener in a cow.


The story doesn’t mention if the dead dear was male or female. That’s important because I want to know if the perpetrator was gay. Without that information, I don’t know how fascinated I should be.


And lord help me, I can’t stop wondering what specific kind of sex he had. Did he arrange the deer in missionary position – which is the way I prefer to imagine it – or was he just getting a little antler? Was he whispering sweet nothings, or was he having angry sex and yelling something along the lines of “I…TOLD…YOU…TO…STAY…OUT…OF…THE…ROAD!!!!”


The story doesn’t mention if the perpetrator tapped the deer where he found it in the ditch or if he dragged it home and put lipstick on it first. My guess is that he got busy right in the ditch, based on three facts:


1. Deer are heavy.


2. He got caught.


3. If a man is horny enough to fornicate with a dead deer, he’s probably too horny to wait until he gets it home.


I’m trying to picture the cop arriving on the scene. The deer-humper looks up from the ditch, sees the cop looking down at him, and asks himself this question: “Is there any point in stopping?” It seems to me that the legal punishment for man-on-deer sex would be exactly the same whether you finish or not. I picture him holding up two fingers and saying to the cop, “Just two minutes. Almost done.”


The cop wouldn’t mind waiting. He’d be busy covering his entire body and the back seat of his cruiser with plastic gloves before he handcuffed the guy.


I also wonder what the cop was thinking. If I were the cop, I’d be worrying that this would be the exact time I had a coincidental heart attack, rolled into the ditch, and became part of this guy’s threesome. This is why people like me do not become cops. I worry about all the wrong things.


Some people might say this was a victimless crime, but I think that depends on whether the perpetrator has recently broken up with a girlfriend. If so, I would say she’s not too happy about this development. It’s one thing to lose your guy to a cheerleader, but it really has to sting when you lose your guy to road kill. How did he break it to her? “It’s not you, baby, it’s me…and a carcass I noticed on route 9.”


Anyway, the moral of this story – and there is one – is that if you ever see a dead deer in a ditch, and you are aroused by it, your best strategy is to pass the buck.


Or get a windowless van.

Excellent New Product for Men
If you’re a guy, you’ve probably heard way too many times a variation of this not-really-a-question: “Could you hold my purse?”


As you know, there is no way to hold a purse in a manly fashion. After sixty seconds of transporting a designer bag full of Tampons and lipstick, your testosterone will be so low that you’ll be playing field hockey and lactating.


You can try holding the purse in a manly, irregular fashion, but it won’t help. It’s still a purse. And you’re holding it. You big wuss. Say goodbye to your gonads; they’ll be hiding in your torso like two BBs in an airplane hangar.


That’s why I invented the PursePliers ™. They are exactly like regular pliers, but you carry them in your back pocket in all times in case you are asked to hold a woman’s purse. When you hear the call, “Honey, would you grab my purse?” you whip out the pliers and use them to safely transport the purse and its wuss cooties.


The recommended way to lift a purse with pliers is by grabbing the zipper and holding it the way you would hold fresh road kill, at a safe distance from your body, just in case it’s not totally dead. Research has shown that wuss cooties can not cross pliers.


While there is no manly way to touch a purse with your bare hands, there is no unmanly way to use pliers. Your PursePliers can be used in a variety of situations, including shopping for a blouse for your wife, passing the low-calorie salad dressing, and tucking in a baby.


PursePliers: Their time is now.
