Buying gifts is risky proposition. No matter what you buy, it sends an unintentional message about what you’re thinking. And that message isn’t always good. Here are just a few ways a gift can go wrong:


 1.  Clothing gifts say, “Tell the cat to stop dressing you. I’ve come to the rescue.”
 2.  Clothes that are a size too large beg the question “Is this how big you think I look?”
 3.  Clothes that are too small raise the non-zero possibility that you’re just being a jerk.
 4.  A new vacuum cleaner says, “When I think of a dirty carpet, I think of you.”
 5.  Sexy gifts say, “I was shopping online with my other hand.”
 6.  Hobby-related gifts say, “I noticed you don’t do things that are, um, useful.”
 7.  Kitchen-related gifts say, “I tasted your cooking. I hope the problem was your tools.”
 8.  Inexpensive gifts say, “Well, either I’m cheap or you’re worthless. Pick one.”
 9.  Expensive gifts say, “I’m hiding a dark secret.”
 10. Exercise-related gifts say, “I’ve seen you look better.”

The worst type of gift is anything in the home décor category. You have a 1% chance of picking something the recipient considers a perfect fit for the house. If the recipient puts your hideous gift on the mantle, it will serve as a year-round reminder of your bad gift-giving skills and your even worse sense of taste. And if the recipient opens your gift and walks directly to a dark closet to bury it under a pile, the rest of Christmas day will feel awkward.

What we all need this holiday season are some sure-fire, high probability gift ideas. As I mentioned last year, when buying for a woman, the smartest gift I’ve seen is silver jewelry with the name of the recipient’s kids, pets, or family. See Hayjac Designs http://www.hayjac.com/. The message is “I noticed how much you love your family.”  I’ll bet that gift has a 100% success rate.

And if you know someone with an office job, you can’t go too wrong with Dilbert gifts http://thedilbertstore.com/?utm_source=dilbert.com&utm_medium=button&utm_campaign=Top%20Navigation%20Link&refcode=DB1008, especially the top selling calendar http://www.amazon.com/Dilbert-2012-Day-Day-Calendar/dp/1449403921/ref=zg_bs_1084466_1on Amazon.com. The message with that sort of gift is “You have excellent reading comprehension and a warped sense of humor.”

Let’s hear your gift ideas. Describe the gift and tell me what message it sends, especially if it’s funny or smart. Include links if you can.
