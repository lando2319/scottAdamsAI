In Top Tech Blog http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/124883253581/top-tech-102-hospital-robots-spectral-scanners:

Here comes a little company that is about to change the world with a small device http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/124883253581/top-tech-102-hospital-robots-spectral-scanners that scans your food and tells you what is in it.

You might be saying this is no big deal. It is just another way for diet Nazis to obsess over something new.

But imagine being able to scan your food and have the device tell you it is unhealthy (in essence). How many parents would keep serving unhealthy food to their kids if they have an option? I think a food scanner changes the world (if it works.)

How?

Well, for starters, Warren Buffett’s investments in crap-foods will start to suffer. So your notions about skill versus luck in the stock market will dissolve at the same rate as the sales of Kraft and Coke.

But more importantly, this is one more step toward society’s “discovery” that what you eat has an impact on your happiness. When you don’t know you’re eating crap for lunch, you might think you’re tired that afternoon for no particular reason. But when you start to see the clear connection between bad diet and how you feel in a few hours, you’ll probably stop injuring yourself with food.

Good information about your body’s fuel source changes healthcare, life expectancy, happiness, productivity. Well, everything.

And I think a handheld food scanner does all that. (If it works.)

The question for today is this: Would you improve your diet if you had better information? (I predict most of you will say no because you mistakenly believe you already know what are putting in your body.)

Hey, Mark Twain just gave me a great book review http://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1376677690&sr=1-1 on Amazon. I guess the rumors of his death were exaggerated.
