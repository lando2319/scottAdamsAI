I can’t decide if I prefer the candidate for President who says we should consider all the facts before deciding when to withdraw troops from Iraq or the one who says we should consider all the facts before deciding when to withdraw troops from Iraq.

On a marginally related note, I can’t help wondering whether McCain and Obama are both closet atheists. My hunch is that they are.

McCain is famously quiet about his faith, which is strange for a Republican candidate. And you have to wonder what five years in a prison camp does to your belief, assuming his buddies who didn’t make it out were praying too. My hunch is that he’s not a believer.

Obama came to Christianity about the same time he realized it was useful to his future ambitions. He seems like a pragmatist to me. The majority of people at his education level aren’t believers. My hunch is that he isn’t a believer either.

I won’t quibble if you disagree. It’s just a feeling I get by watching how they operate and how they present themselves. The truth will never be known. What’s your hunch?
