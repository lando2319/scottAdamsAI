Win Bigly is a tutorial on weapons-grade persuasion, using as a backdrop the personal story of how I used my knowledge of persuasion to predict a number of unlikely events during the 2016 election. You’ll have a new superpower when you are done with it. And you’ll never see reality the same way again. (In a good way.)

If you liked my book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1591846919/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1376677690&sr=1-1&keywords=how+to+fail+at+almost+everything+and+still+win+big, you know it taught you how to persuade yourself toward success (essentially). Win Bigly teaches you how to persuade others. I hope you use your new powers for good.

Win Bigly is some of my best work. You’re gonna like it.
