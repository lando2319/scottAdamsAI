Is it my imagination… or is Hillary Clinton yelling her speeches lately?

And didn’t Donald Trump start questioning her “stamina” a few months ago?

In the 2D world of politics, those two things are unrelated. But in the 3D world of persuasion, Trump is making Clinton yell herself hoarse to prove she has stamina. 

And once she is hoarse and tired from all the yelling, Trump will point out that she lacks stamina.

Yes, he is that good.

And do you think it is a coincidence that Trump called Megyn Kelly a bimbo and then she got a non-bimbo haircut that is …well, Trumpian? It doesn’t look like a coincidence to this trained persuader.

And is it a coincidence that Bernie Sanders and everyone else in the world including me can’t stop saying one thing “trumped” another? And why the hell is everything suddenly huuuuuuge? (Or yuuuuuge.)

And when Clinton’s campaign decided on its clever new slogan of “Love Trumps Hate http://www.imediaethics.org/love-trumps-hate-globe-and-mail-misquotes-hillary-clinton-tweet-on-donald-trump-muslim-ban/,” did they realize they were LITERALLY MAKING CAMPAIGN POSTERS TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE TO LOVE DONALD TRUMP?

No, they did not. 

But that’s what happened.

Today I coined the phrase persuasion denier for people who think Clinton’s current poll numbers mean she will beat Trump in November. If persuasion is real – and significant for elections – the past will not predict the future. The Master Persuader will warp reality until he gets what he wants. He’s halfway done.

Don’t be one of them. I have it on good authority that at least 5 billion of those people are not nice. Avoid that association at all costs.
