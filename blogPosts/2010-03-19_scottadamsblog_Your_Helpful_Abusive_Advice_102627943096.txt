Humans are usually polite. That can be stressful, especially if some mass hole has earned a serious verbal smack down, and you’re too nice to deliver it. It’s bad for your health to keep that sort of venom all bottled up.

Now is your chance to let it out. Think about the last person who needed your practical and yet rudely abusive advice, and leave your monologue here in the comment section. You don’t need to describe the person or the situation, unless it’s absolutely necessary. It will be funnier if you start right into the abusive advice. Keep it PG-13ish please.
