Hi There.

I want to share my thoughts on the current [Dilbert] calendar block I am working through this year.

I have had these for two or three years but have been completely disappointed with the content in this years’ effort. Gone are the clever jokes and observations and instead we seem to have an almost formula approach which to me frequently misses the mark. I check the daily cartoons on the Dilbert website and these are still as sharp and funny as they have always been.

To me it is as if someone else is creating the calendar and not really achieving the required result. I for one won’t buy it next year as it just isn’t funny.

Regards
