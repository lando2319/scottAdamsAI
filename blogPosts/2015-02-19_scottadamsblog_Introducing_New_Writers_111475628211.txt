Berkeley Start-Up Review http://scottadams-startupreview.tumblr.com/ - By Tamra Teig

> Tamra Teig will spotlight the most interesting start-ups that have some connection to UC Berkeley. Berkeley is second only to Stanford in the number of start-ups coming from alums. You’ll see some fascinating companies in the spotlight. 

> I earned my MBA from the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley many moons ago, and I’m involved with the Berkeley Angel Network, so I have some connections to help Tamra find the interesting stories.

> Bio:  Tamra Teig has a degree in journalism and has been a writer and marketing communications consultant for over 20 years. While her earlier work was focused on magazine and newspaper features and newsletters, the majority of her career has been devoted to business development through corporate communications and digital marketing content.

Each of these blogs will evolve over time based on reader responses. I would love to hear your comments. 

By way of background, several months ago I offered to make space available on Dilbert.com for other artists. I got more submissions than I expected. These are the three writers that I think fit best with the audience here. If this works out, I will be looking to grow the idea.

What do you think?
