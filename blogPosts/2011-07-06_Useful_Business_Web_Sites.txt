It bugs me that there are tools on the Internet that I would find handy if only I knew they existed. I did a bit of searching and pulled together a list of useful, single-purpose, free, business utility sites that you probably didn’t know exist.

boxoh.com http://boxoh.com/ - Track any shipment

whichdateworks.com http://whichdateworks.com/ - Find a date that works for everyone

everytimezone.com http://everytimezone.com/ - A clear graphic of world time zones

followupthen.com http://www.followupthen.com/ - Quick way to set up a reminder email to yourself

www.dafont.com http://www.dafont.com/ - Thousands of free fonts for PC and Mac

www.anonymouse.org http://anonymouse.org/ - Surf the web without revealing your identity

encrypted.google.com https://encrypted.google.com/ - Keeps your search queries private from nosey bosses

www.hipmunk.com http://www.hipmunk.com/ - Best interface for finding a flight to book

seatguru.com http://www.seatguru.com/ - Best way to find the right seat on a flight

flightstats.com http://www.flightstats.com/ - Track flights

Do you know of other sites that meet the criteria of being a useful, single-purpose, free, business utility that most people would find useful but probably don’t know exist? I’ll update the list from your input. (No entertainment sites, please.)
