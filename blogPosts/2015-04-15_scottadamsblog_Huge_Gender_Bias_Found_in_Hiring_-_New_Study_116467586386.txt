CNN reports on a new study showing there is a HUGE gender bias in hiring decisions in the United States and it has been this way in some fields since the eighties. You already knew there was gender bias in hiring (duh) but you probably did not know how bad it was. Check this out: The gender preference in hiring decisions was 2-to-1 in some areas for candidates with equal qualifications. 

That is an embarrassing number for a country that prides itself on equal opportunity. A 2-to-1 advantage is not even within driving distance of equal rights.

By the way, this study matches my personal observations over a lifetime. I have been in countless meetings in which a strong gender preference in hiring was discussed behind closed doors. Now I feel terrible about all those conversations. I am officially part of the problem because I did nothing to stop it.

I’m not sure if I mentioned that the study shows the gender advantage in hiring favors women by 2-to-1. That matches my experience in business. I have been in lots of closed-door meeting with other men discussing a preference for hiring women. I have never heard a man express a preference for hiring another man. Nor have I heard it in a private conversation. It makes me wonder how common my situation is.

Here’s the study http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/13/opinions/williams-ceci-women-in-science/index.html.

Two questions for you:

1. Have you ever been in a business meeting in which you or co-workers discussed a preference for hiring women?

2. Have you ever been in a business meeting in which you or your coworkers discussed a preference for hiring a man?

Drones that hunt other drones http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/116397070621/top-tech-37-smarter-drone-catching-drone in the sky and identify the human operator based on radio signals. I need that drone-hunter for defending my home from drones! Every celebrity should have one. How the hell does Madonna keep the camera drones from hovering outside her bedroom window?

And now there are drones that do the hard part of lining up your perfect photograph http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/116397070621/top-tech-37-smarter-drone-catching-drone for you while you concentrate on taking the picture.

Also coming soon, artificial limbs that can feel what they touch http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/116397070621/top-tech-37-smarter-drone-catching-drone. How long before people voluntarily give up their weak human limbs for powerful robot arms that feel the same? We are in The Age of Cyborgs. The human reign is pretty much over.
