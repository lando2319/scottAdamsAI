Here’s an impression of me trying to do any fucking thing on my smart phone: Tap and tap tap tap and now I am distracted by this text tap tap I wish I had that file with me but it is on my workstation and I never figured out how to set up access on my phone I should remember that one of these days I’ll get around to it but for now I better take care of this thing I was what the hell was I doing
