 



The hardest part about writing is capturing your own (or someone else’s) inner thoughts. For example, if I ask you to tell me something funny or frustrating about your job, you’d give me tales of coworkers eating your food from the break room fridge, or tell me your boss is incompetent. But those aren’t thoughts, just observations. We seem to store memories in terms of actions and some broad emotions, but not thoughts. And it is the thoughts you generally don’t voice that make writing interesting.

Let’s test this. In the comments section, tell me what you were DOING immediately before reading this blog, and also tell me what you were THINKING about while you did it. If you can do both of those things, you are halfway to being an interesting and humorous writer.

For example, “I was answering an e-mail from my coworker Karl while thinking he won’t understand my answer because he has an unusually small head that probably can’t hold much of a hat much less a brain.”

Your turn.
