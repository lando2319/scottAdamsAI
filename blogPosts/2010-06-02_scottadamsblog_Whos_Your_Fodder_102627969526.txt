If you’re at work, summarize the last conversation (or e-mail) you had prior to reading this post and include all relevant buzzwords. The more mundane the better. Bonus points if your last conversation was completely unintellible when taken out of context. I’ll turn one of your entries (maybe more) into a comic.

Don’t try to pick the funniest or most ironic conversation. Pick the most recent.

And thank you for doing half of my work today.
