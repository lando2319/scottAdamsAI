Over the past 20 years or so, most of China’s leaders have been engineers. I’m embarrassed to say that I was not aware of this until recently. Suddenly, everything makes sense.

For years I have marveled at the fact that the Chinese government could be so practical. They didn’t seem bogged down by the superstitions and sideshow passions that you so often see in other governments. China’s leaders make decisions like engineers. For example, every time I hear someone yapping about how China harvests organs from executed criminals, all I’m thinking is That’s a practical way to get spare parts.

China’s leadership isn’t big on religion. And apparently they don’t see any upside in war. They handle their money wisely. They put a lot of energy into building infrastructure. And they care more about stability than human rights. In other words, they value efficiency over feelings. It’s exactly the way you’d expect a bunch of engineers to run a country. Obviously this approach has served China well.

The bad news for China is that their up-and-coming leaders have backgrounds in law, economics, and history. In time, the lawyers will start passing lots of laws that individually make sense while collectively strangling the business sector in red tape. The economists will all disagree with each other, and the historians will be planning for the past. So China is pretty much doomed. But they had a good run.
