Because I know you will ask…

In the 2D world of traditional politics, Sarah Palin’ http://www.businessinsider.com/sarah-palin-endorses-donald-trump-2016-1s endorsement of Donald Trump looks like a yawn because she’s seen by many as a policy lightweight. But in the 3D world of persuasion, where Trump lives, it is probably a home-run.

Trump’s biggest obstacle is his perceived lack of empathy, along with voter suspicions about his motives. Palin’s endorsement says, in effect, that she doesn’t see anything dark in his soul. You can dislike Palin’s politics, but she is ridiculously likable on a personal level. And that likability probably translates into some sort of irrational trust about her people-judging skills.

This keeps all the media attention focused on Trump – on a safe and fluffy topic – and guarantees that no one will ask him to name the heads of state in the Middle East for at least one week.

Palin’s history with Cruz gives this story legs at least until every pundit has said every obvious thing you can say on the topic.

Getting the Palin endorsement is a perfect play for the Master Persuader. It touches all the right bases.
