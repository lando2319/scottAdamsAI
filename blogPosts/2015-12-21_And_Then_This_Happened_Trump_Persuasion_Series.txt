I don’t even know how to categorize this article http://www.salon.com/2015/12/21/the_media_needs_to_stop_telling_this_lie_about_donald_trump_im_a_sanders_supporter_and_value_honesty/ in Salon except to say it fits the Master Persuader prediction of a coming Trump landslide. It might blow your mind a little, considering the source.

Recently, Huffington Post did an awkward about-face and announced it was moving its Trump coverage from the entertainment section to whatever they call news over there. That had to hurt. The Master Persuader filter saw that coming since August.

In stark contrast to Huffington Post, someone smart is running Salon these days. I’m seeing a lot of strong writing out of them lately, whether you agree with it or not.
