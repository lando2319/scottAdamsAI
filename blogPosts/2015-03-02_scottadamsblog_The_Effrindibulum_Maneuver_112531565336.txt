Our bodies have too many parts. I can’t be expected to remember all of them. That’s why I created the word effrindibulum. Now when someone points to their ear and asks “What is the name of this part?” I can answer confidently that it is called the effrindibulum.

This word has many uses. If you injure yourself, and you don’t remember the name of the tendon or muscle involved, just say you pulled your effrindibulum and change the subject.

In order for this method to work for you, try saying out loud the word effrindibulum until you can say it with confidence the next time a discussion of body parts comes up. Try to be casual about it, this way.

Person 1: My cat scratched me on the … um…what is this?

You: That’s your effrindibulum. Looks like a bad scratch. Want to go to lunch?

You don’t want to linger on the topic. Just display your deep knowledge of anatomy and move on.

Let me know how it works out for you.
