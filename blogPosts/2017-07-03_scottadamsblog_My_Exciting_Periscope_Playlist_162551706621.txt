My viewer traffic on Periscope (streaming video) exploded this week. I experimented with performance-humor in a few cases and those videos went viral. You might want to check out a few of them on your holiday road trips. Here are the topics of interest:

I explain why “Modern Day Presidential” is weapons-grade persuasion https://www.pscp.tv/ScottAdamsSays/1mrGmgyXnAMxy? (9 minutes)

I discuss President Trump’s wrestling/CNN GIF that got everyone wound up.  https://www.pscp.tv/ScottAdamsSays/1YpKknwXZWPxj?(23 minutes)

I tell you how President Trump’s tweeting killed my cat. https://www.pscp.tv/ScottAdamsSays/1YpJkngBMREGj? (21 minutes)

I tell you how to negotiate peace with North Korea. (Really) https://www.pscp.tv/ScottAdamsSays/1vAGRbApLqZGl? (12 minutes)

I tell you how President Trump destroyed civilization with his Morning Joe tweets. (This one went viral) https://www.pscp.tv/ScottAdamsSays/1ZkJzyXQXgoGv? (18 minutes)

If you only watch one of them, start with the last one on the list. Many of the people who viewed it believed I was being serious. It is my most-watched video of all time.

Yes, yes, I know you prefer written blogs over videos. But my writing muscles are worn out from completing my upcoming book https://www.amazon.com/Win-Bigly-Persuasion-World-Matter/dp/0735219710, and I needed a writing break. Will get back to blogging soon. I just finished writing my book and sent it off for copyediting. Look for it by end of October. (It will make you tingle.)
