I’m trying to come up with a good Halloween costume. I prefer something topical and funny. I don’t want to be the guy who shows up at the party wearing sweat pants and says he’s a baseball player. Maybe you can help.

One idea is to wear a Barack Obama name tag with my regular clothes. Then I’ll wait for someone to say, “Barack Obama? How’s that Barack Obama? I had such high expectations for your costume and all you did was…oh, wait. I get it.”

Do you have a better idea? (Dressing as a Dilbert character is too obvious.)
