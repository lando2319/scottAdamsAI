I mentioned recently http://blog.dilbert.com/post/138493982111/the-cruz-prophesy that my 2004 book, The Religion War http://www.amazon.com/Religion-War-Scott-Adams/dp/0740747886/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=, featured a leader named Cruz rising in the United States and bringing a war of annihilation to the Caliphate. Now we have candidate Ted Cruz doing well in the polls and stating his intentions to annihilate ISIS. Obviously that is a coincidence, but a fun one.

But where I went wrong was the first name. My character in the book was named Horatio Cruz, not Ted Cruz.

Now watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt-vG_TdOT4 of 18-year old Ted Cruz talking about wanting to play a character named Horatio. It happens in the first 30 seconds.

Yeah, spooky.

Itâ€™s still a coincidence, but a fun one.
