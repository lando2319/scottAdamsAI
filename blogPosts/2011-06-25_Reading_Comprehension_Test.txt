Here’s a reading comprehension test for readers of Salon, Jezebel, and Change.org. (I borrowed this idea from a comment.)





Reading Comprehension Test:

 

If I say all men have a natural urge to eat, and some men are cannibals, have I implied that all men are natural cannibals? Did I condone the practice of eating people?

 

Discuss

 

 

[Note: Readers of The Huffington Post are exempted from the test because most have already passed it.]

 

Update: I’m adding two more questions.

 

If I say Dutch men are the tallest in the world, which of the following facts have I implied?

 

1. I’m a racist.

2. Every Dutch man is taller than every other man.

3. I have a low opinion of women because I didn’t even mention them.


4. None of the above




If I say I invented a robot that can be used to help feed babies, quadriplegics, and some mentally handicapped people, what else have I implied?

1. Quadriplegics are mentally handicapped.

2. Babies are quadriplegics
