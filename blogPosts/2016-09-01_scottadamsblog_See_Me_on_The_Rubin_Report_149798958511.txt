Many of my readers asked me to appear on the Rubin Report. And so I have. You can see Part 1 (my journey to Dilbert) here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsvpQvPDDWs. Part 2 (the Trump bits) will follow soon.

HYPNOTIC WORDS

Switching topics, someone made a list of “hypnotic” words http://linkis.com/hypnosistrainingacademy.com/RAHr4 that are pre-loaded with persuasion power. I can confirm from my own training as a hypnotist that this list is extraordinary. Master the list and you will have a genuine superpower compared to the unpersuasive masses.

I’m not exaggerating even a little.
