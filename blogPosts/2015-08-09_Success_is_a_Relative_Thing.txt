There is no such thing as absolute success. Success only has meaning in relation to other things. For example, my book, God’s Debris http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Debris-Experiment-Scott-Adams-ebook/dp/B00HFYD8E4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=, is ranked #8 on a recent Amazon.com best seller list in the Religious Studies - Psychology category. That doesn’t seem like much of a success until you notice who placed 9th. It’s all relative.

Suck it, number nine! 

(And by that I mean not literally a “sucking” force but more of an illusion caused by your dead lips bending space-time.)

I’m a terrible winner.

[Update: God’s Debris climbed to #3 after I posted this, but I was happier at #8 because it was funnier.]

How much AC would you save if your windows automatically changed color http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/125957420031/top-tech-111-all-nano-edition-glass-glue to block sunlight on the hot side of a building? We’ve been hearing about color-changing windows forever but this time the economics might work.

I am considering buying this bike that can’t be stolen http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/126057124746/top-tech-112-high-speed-projector-nanoscale just to leave it locked up in Oakland for a weekend so its Chilean designers can see they still have work to do.
