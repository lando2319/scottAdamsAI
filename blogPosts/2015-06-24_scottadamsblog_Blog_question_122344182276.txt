[Ignore this post. Question answered. I had accidentally unzoomed the page sometime in the past, apparently. Didn’t know Chrome can do page-only zoom. Nice! Thanks to all commenters for pointing me the right direction.]




Does anyone else have trouble reading this page using Chrome on a Mac laptop? (OSX: Yosemite 10.10.2)

My own blog is literally the only page I can’t see in normal form. It shows gigantic fonts. 

This is now the only thing keeping me on a Windows machine before the full switch to Apple.

(Changing font size in Chrome settings makes no difference on this page but does change others.)
