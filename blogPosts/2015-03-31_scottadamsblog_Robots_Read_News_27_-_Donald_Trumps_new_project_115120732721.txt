Humor Dimensions: clever, mean, recognizable

Predicted sharing: High

This one has no naughty elements to prevent sharing. The political point is generic and will not cause divisions. Themes about people being dumb perform the best coming from me. Golf is another popular reason for sharing.




Update on Viral Prediction: Sharing is lowest for any of the RRN series. My prediction was totally wrong. What I missed (but should have seen) is that my Twitter account is 95% guys. The single ones don’t get the joke and married ones are too smart to share it. How did I not predict that?
