A rational mind needs regular maintenance. One of the maintenance systems I employ is to remind myself of things I used to be sure about and later discovered to be untrue. I started a list organized by the approximate ages at which I realized my errors. A healthy rational mind needs regular doses of humility. (I might need more humility than most people.)

Here is the approximate age at which I stopped believing in different stuff.

Age 8

Superman
Santa Claus
Tooth Fairy
Easter Bunny

Age 11

God
Angels
Miracles
Money isn’t important for happiness

20s

Reincarnation
Ghosts
People are mostly rational
Unquestioned patriotism is a good thing
Any college is as good as any other
Memories are generally accurate
Looks don’t matter
Wealth doesn’t make you more attractive
Gay is a choice
Alcoholism is a choice

30s

School reputation doesn’t matter
History as taught in school is generally accurate
You can do anything you set your mind to
Flying saucers are visiting on a regular basis
Hard work is almost always rewarded
Some men don’t enjoy porn
Individuals can pick good stocks if they do research
Management is a science

40s

Food pyramid
Vitamin supplements are backed by science
Free will
Solving your problems can bring you lasting happiness

Age 50

Common sense exists (as opposed to experience)
Drink eight glasses of water a day
Exercising is a big help for losing weight
A calorie is a calorie
Don’t swim soon after eating
Wash hands with hot water to kill germs
Marijuana is bad for adult health (Note: still probably bad for kids)
Stretching helps athletic performance
Humans are more likely to be real than artificial/software
Everyone will die
The government isn’t controlled by big money
The stock market is mostly legitimate

You can probably suggest a few things to add to my list.
