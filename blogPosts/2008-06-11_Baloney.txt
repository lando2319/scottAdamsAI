I’m amazed by people who can sleep eight hours a night. If I sleep that much I feel like I got hit by a truck the next day. I prefer six to seven hours of sleep per night. I guess I’m lucky because scientists recently discovered that eight hours a night is too much.

Add the “eight hours of sleep” myth to the eight 8-ounce glasses of water you were supposed to drink per day, the food you weren’t supposed to eat before swimming, and the huge amounts of bread you were supposed to eat for a healthy diet.


Seriously, is there ANYTHING I learned when I was a kid that is true?


I’m reasonably sure that if I make a funny face, it will not get stuck in that position. If I go outside without a jacket, I won’t catch a cold no matter how much the words cold and cold sound alike. And all of my friends who smoked cigarettes ended up taller than me.


What baloney did you learn as a kid?
