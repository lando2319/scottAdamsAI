The problem with civilization is that our stuff is so often in the wrong place.

For example, it bugs me that I pay to heat my house … and then I put my refrigerator inside the heated house. That just feels wrong. I want my fridge to have an insulated conduit to the outdoors that senses temperatures and opens when the outdoors is sufficiently cold to help out. And let’s give that conduit a bug screen and an odor filter. This idea won’t happen soon because it requires the homebuilder and the refrigerator-maker to coordinate. I’ll put this idea on hold until I build my well-planned city of the future.

I recently blogged about the idea of consumers hosting computers in their homes and selling CPU time back to the grid. I got that idea about half right. A reader pointed me to a company that has a smarter take, so much so that I laughed out loud when I checked their website.

The company is Nerdalize http://nerdalize.com/, and their insight is that computers are also accidental heaters. With their business model you can heat your home for free in return for allowing a computer/heater in your home that is connected to the grid. This way data centers don’t need to spend vast amounts of money discarding excess heat that other people would happily pay for. It’s brilliant if it works. I’m going to add this idea to my city of the future too.

I also want a “travel room” in my city of the future. It’s a room that has TV screens on all four walls, coordinated with a 360-degree camera on a drone located anywhere in the world. If I want to take a flying tour of the alps, for example, I just rent time on the drone. My travel room will feel as if I am flying, and I can navigate the drone to whatever tourist site I want. Just to keep things safe, let’s say the drone is programmed to avoid dangerous situations, such as kamikaze attacks on the locals.

My next post will be about a plan to keep the economy humming along after robots take over all of the manual labor and put two-thirds of humans out of work.
