My stalker is back.

Regular readers know that a Canadian woman named Christina Lane goes off her meds every few years and fills the Internet with stories of how I secretly travel to Canada to ransack her apartment and sexually abuse everyone I meet along the way. She also believes everything I write in any forum is actually an intended insult to her personally.



Ever wonder what it’s like to be a little famous?

Imagine a woman calling all of your professional associates (publishers, syndication company, my restaurant employees) to tell them you have been sexually abusing her for years. That’s what my stalker did.

Anyway, she’s back, and on Twitter now. Look out for @faeralane.

And if anyone up in Canada can help get Christina Lane back on her meds, that would be a big help.
