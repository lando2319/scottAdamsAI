Every once in a while I get a check for some miscellaneous activity of life. It’s usually a rebate or refund, or a friend paying up for some group activity I organized. And every time it makes me angry because I have to take that stupid check to the bank and deposit it. It feels so 1990s.

I am frankly amazed that checks still exist. And you know how happy you are when standing in line and the person in front of you whips out a check.

I will have limited time to blog for a few weeks, so today I’m just wondering what else you encounter in your daily life that seems like it should have gone the way of buggy whips ten years ago.
