In the Republican undercard debate tonight http://www.bustle.com/articles/130086-george-pataki-calls-donald-trump-president-in-possibly-the-biggest-gaffe-of-the-republican-debates, George Pataki referred to Trump as “president.”

That’s the tell for persuasion that I predicted in this post http://blog.dilbert.com/post/135152311211/calling-the-clinton-top-trump-persuasion-series. Search on the page for “bonus thought”. The idea is that Trump has been acting like a president so effectively (and intentionally) that you feel as if he is the incumbent.

That is some world-class persuasion. I saw this developing months ago. You’ll see a flurry of it in the coming months.

Oh, and Huckabee made a point of saying the president needs to be a “persuader.” He used the word several times.


Probably a coincidence. We still can’t rule out the Lucky Hitler hypothesis for why Trump is polling well.

And obviously Trump’s popularity could be because voters like outsiders. And by that I mean they like one of the three outsiders, then two insiders, then another outsider, in roughly that order. Wait, is Fiorina still in the race?
