If someone told you that you had to give up one of your five senses, which one would you let go? My vote is smell.


Recently I lost my sense of smell thanks to, I assume, some allergy meds I’ve been snorting. I assume it’s temporary. I never would have noticed I couldn’t smell except my wife, Shelly, kept asking versions of the question “Do you smell that? It’s awful!” But I never smelled that.

Over time I have come to realize that the ratio of stinky smells to delicious smells is very high. If the price for not smelling a flatulent cat five times a night is that I also don’t get to smell pumpkin pie once a year, I’ll take that deal.

I suppose there’s a risk I won’t smell a gas leak or something else that’s about to kill me. Maybe someday I’ll have a watch with a built-in sensor to detect that sort of thing. Until then I just hang with people who have functional noses and let them sort out the cat poop from the flaming sofa smells.

I think I also gave up something in the food tasting department thanks to my lack of a functional sniffer, but I’m okay with that too. I’ve dropped about eight pounds in the last two months because lately I’m not attracted to the taste of food, just its utility.

So this got me thinking that a good diet strategy is to numb your sense of smell, thus making food just a bit less attractive. I can say from experience that I don’t miss all that deliciousness because I don’t crave it. When I imagine eating a formerly delicious food, now I imagine it as an ordinary food and don’t feel much desire for it.

I wonder if people who overeat have better sense of smell than other people. So I put it to you: Tell me your relative weight (thin, medium, or overweight) and whether you believe you have a good sense of smell or not. Let’s see if there is an unscientific correlation.
