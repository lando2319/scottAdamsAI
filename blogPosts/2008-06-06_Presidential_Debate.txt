This blog has a comment ranking system. Let’s have some fun with it by having our own presidential debate. Pick a side, either Obama or McCain, and leave a comment explaining why your pick would be the best president.


Then be sure to vote for the best other comments that aren’t your own. Let’s see which arguments float to the top.



You are not required to be brief, but my guess is that people will vote you down if you can’t make your case in a paragraph or two.



The challenge is to support your argument. For example, saying one candidate will vote for some particular treaty is just a fact, not an argument, unless you can include a link to an article saying most experts disagree with the treaty.



Go.
