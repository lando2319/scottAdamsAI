Back in January of 2016 I said this about Bernie Sanders’ new campaign ad:

> 1. Identity (best)

> 3. Reason (useless)

> Bernie Sanders had been operating in the lower two categories along with Hillary Clinton. But his new ad http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fpolitics%2F2016-election%2Fnew-sanders-ad-uses-simon-garfunkel-classic-america-n501061%3Fcid%3Dsm_tw%26hootPostID%3Dec75627570a142acea590785bbe02399&t=NzlkYmFlNzc3YTlmMzRkMTcwZjZhNmJkNzk0Y2Q1ZWU4ZGRjNGE1YixKY280ZWE4YQ%3D%3D&b=t%3ATA_nNgSP4kCXBxItG5afUg&p=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.dilbert.com%2Fpost%2F137759292281%2Fbernie-sanders-turns-on-the-iowa-afterburners&m=1, set to a Simon and Garfunkel tune, is pure identity (America!) and pure gold.

Today an article http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/312298-bernie-sanders-america-ad-made-viewers-happiest-study in The Hill discusses a Vanderbilt University study that says this ad ranked at the top of all campaign ads for making people “happy and hopeful” according to the New York Times.

There were a lot of campaign ads in that election. The Persuasion Filter spotted this one as special. Apparently it was.

When you learn to recognize the tools of persuasion it is like acquiring a superpower. I’ll be blogging and live-streaming on this topic in 2017. We’re going to have a lot of fun. 

Welcome to a new year. This one won’t be like any before.

A NEW LAW IN CALIFORNIA SAYS YOU CAN’T HOLD YOUR PHONE IN YOUR HAND WHILE DRIVING, EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT TEXTING. IT DOESN’T MATTER WHICH APP YOU ARE USING. 

I recommend getting a phone holder for your dashboard and installing the WhenHub app so you can see the people you are meeting on a map as you approach. (It’s like the Uber app but without the Uber car. Anyone can show their location temporarily on the way to a get-together.) That way you skip all of the texting back and forth that happens as you try to find each other in the last mile.
