My deal with Snickers was that she would be obedient 364 days out of every year. But on her birthday she would get to be in charge and I would do whatever she commanded.

Well, that’s how it used to be anyway. I didn’t know she had a hidden video camera during her last birthday. Now she is blackmailing me by threatening to release the video that was taken after this screen shot. So our new deal is that now I only get to be in charge on my birthday. And I have to wear the orange pumpkin costume. This is exactly why I don’t like birthdays.

I think my problem started that time I had a sore neck and Snickers thought I was bowing to her. She’s alpha as a mo-fo and it must have triggered something. Anyway, I have to go; Snickers is demanding more treats AGAIN.
