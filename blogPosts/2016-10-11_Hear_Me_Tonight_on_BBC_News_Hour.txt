I’m heading out to record an interview at the London office of the BBC, for News Hour. It airs in the 8 PM hour in London, so 2 PM EST.

The topic is Trump. They asked me to explain why so many people in America would vote for him. Apparently that is a bit of a mystery over here. I’ll clear it up for them, even though I endorse Gary Johnson.
