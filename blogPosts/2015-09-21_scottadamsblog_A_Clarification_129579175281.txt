After Jimmy Fallon said in his monologue on The Tonight Show that I compared Trump to Jesus http://blog.dilbert.com/post/129487135116/calling-jimmy-from-the-third-dimension, I knew I needed to clarify a few things. So on Twitter https://twitter.com/ScottAdamsSaysI said…

That was only a joke. But just to be super-clear, I am not saying Trump healed any sick people either.

Although … to be fair, the taxes Trump has paid over his lifetime have probably funded more healing than Jesus could have handled one-on-one in his entire life. But it isn’t a competition. No one is keeping score.

Another difference is that Jesus shows forgiveness whereas Trump refuses to apologize in the first place. So I call that sort of a tie.

But on the intangibles, it’s all Jesus. He’s a clear winner.
