Did you notice on the Dilbert.com home page that there’s a new search box above the strip? You can now search the entire Dilbert archive by key word. Once you find the strip you like, you can easily have it put on a mug, t-shirt, mouse pad, or water bottle.

You can also order the strip for your PowerPoint presentation or other business use, all online.

Or you can just read, for example, all of the Ratbert strips at once. Or all of the strips that mention Mission Statements, or sales, or Unix, or whatever. I just spent about an hour looking for my own favorites.

I’ve waited 15 years for this capability. It took a huge effort to manually enter all of the keywords. I have to say the result is quite awesome.
