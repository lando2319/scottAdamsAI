In the early days of Dilbert, when something interesting or crazy happened in the world, I often included it in the comic. My ultimate goal was to someday reverse the chain of cause and effect, so I could write the comic first, and have reality correspond to Dilbert soon after. Obviously, in order to get from the old system of causation to the new one, I’d need to pass through a period in which Dilbert and reality are happening simultaneously. I think that started today. Check out Dilbert /strips/comic/2012-02-13/for February 13th and this article http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/02/12/new-technology-can-read-your-mind.htmlfrom Newsweek published the same day.

If things are going according to plan, I will soon be able to control reality through Dilbert. Let’s test that concept. The Dilbert comic I’m drawing today will involve the stock market rising, and it will be published on April 16th.  The comic will appear before the markets open in the United States. Mark your calendars so you can see if the broad market has a solid up day.

For legal reasons, I probably need to disclose that I own stocks in the broad market indexes. And in case it wasn’t obvious, it probably isn’t a good idea to make investment decisions based on comic strips or the predictions of cartoonists.
