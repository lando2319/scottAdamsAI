The new site design is live! Let me know what you think.

The blog commenting system should be better in every way. I hope you like it.



Why’d it take so long to update the site? The comic syndication business experienced some major consolidation a few years ago and that led to some of the Dilbert contractual rights changing hands a few times. And that state of flux made it impractical to update the site until now. (Yes, I do see the Dilbert irony.)

The good news is that I landed with the strongest company in the field, Universal Uclick. Now we can have some fun. The new site design is just the beginning.

I will be introducing you to some new writers/content providers for the site in the next month. I’ll preview their work in this space and then set them up as their own page on the site.

By now you know I treat this sort of thing as a system and not a goal. The new site design will make it easier to test new types of content and refine things as we go. There is no way to know where any of this ends up, but I’m sure the system is improving my odds of something good happening.

Sometimes I think curiosity is my prime motivation in life. I’ll be fascinated to see where this goes. And I hope you’ll come along for the show.
