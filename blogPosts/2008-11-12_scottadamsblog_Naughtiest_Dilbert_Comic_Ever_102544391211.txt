I wonder how many people got the joke in the last panel of this comic. Do you know what the “lucky guess” refers to?

On a totally unrelated note, which I add because this blog post would be otherwise inadequately sized, here’s an update on  my voice, in case anyone is curious. Thanks to surgery in July to correct my exotic voice problem (Spasmodic Dysphonia), I now have a virtually normal voice. It started coming back strong in the past few weeks.

This is a life changing event for me. I lived for 3.5 years without the ability to speak in most situations, and with the knowledge that the condition was considered incurable. However unpleasant you imagine it is to be unable to speak, I can assure you it was worse. But thanks to one surgeon, Dr. Berke at UCLA, apparently my problem is solved.

And so I am reborn, in a sense. Every day since the rewired nerves in my neck regenerated, and speech returned, life has been terrific.
