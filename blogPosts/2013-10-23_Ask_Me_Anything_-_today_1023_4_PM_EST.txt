I’ll be doing an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit at 4 PM EST today (10/23/13).

That’s 1 PM for my California friends.

You can find it by going to this link http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/ when the time comes.

I expect some haters so it should be fun.

Have I mentioned that I have a new book http://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1591846919/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1376677690&sr=1-1&keywords=how+to+fail+at+almost+everything+and+still+win+big.?
