 Do you remember the fellow who was fired for posting a Dilbert comic at work? It made national news twice. The first time was when he got fired, and the second time was when I did a series of comics about it:

Later I posted Dave Steward’s story and his resume on my blog, hoping someone would offer him a job. He just e-mailed to say something good came of it. Dilbert blog reader Bob Buchholz offered to help Dave with his resume (which needed help), and a company with a sense of humor gave him a job a month ago. Dave thinks Bob’s help on the resume made the difference. He’s working security again, this time within walking distance of his home.


I don’t know Bob personally, but apparently he is a generous guy.
