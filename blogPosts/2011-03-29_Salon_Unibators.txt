Over at Salon.com, the poorly informed are in full unibation mode over their shared hallucinations of my Men’s Rights post. I trotted over to set things right, intending to have my usual fun, but their registration system is either broken or for some other reason failing to send me an email to finish the process. (No, it’s not in my spam.)

If any of you have a Salon account, could you do me a favor and head over to the articles by these binarian unibators and provide a link to my explanation of the Men’s Rights controversy in its proper context? I think it would be funny.
