In late October 2015, Hillary Clinton started playing the gender card http://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2015/10/23/hillary-clinton-plays-the-gender-card. I predicted that her support would start dropping after I heard her play that card in the televised debate.

See this graph http://www.vox.com/2016/1/20/10793856/sanders-iowa-men of her dropping popularity with men in Iowa. That last drop-off in November starts soon after she went full-sexist. In the 2D world, it is a coincidence. In the 3D world, it was guaranteed to happen. (Because identity beats reason.)

That’s how Trump wins in a landslide if Clinton is nominated. Clinton’s brand as a Democrat depended on her not jumping the shark from equality to superiority, even if people think she is right that men are bad listeners. Clinton said other things about men too, but I wasn’t listening.
