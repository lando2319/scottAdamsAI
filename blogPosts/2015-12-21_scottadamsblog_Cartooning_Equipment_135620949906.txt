I also write books http://www.amazon.com/Scott-Adams/e/B004N47QVK/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1. Most of them are good holiday gifts. And don’t forget your Dilbert day-to-day box calendar http://www.amazon.com/Dilbert-2016-Day---Day-Calendar/dp/1449465145/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1450674662&sr=1-1&keywords=dilbert+calendar+2016 for 2016.
