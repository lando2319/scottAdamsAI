I interrupt this otherwise fascinating blog to give away some free stuff.

If you’d like to add your favorite Major League Baseball team’s schedule (USA) to your calendar with a few clicks, it will only take about ten seconds at CalendarTree.com http://bit.ly/N8iAnK. Click on the “Public Schedules” link. (I’m a co-founder of CalendarTree http://bit.ly/N8iAnK.)

You don’t need to sign up for anything. Just click to add the team schedule of your choice to your Google, Apple, or Outlook calendar.

To sweeten the deal, I’ll email a personalized Dogbert sketch to anyone who tweets the baseball schedule link (CalendarTree.com http://bit.ly/N8iAnK) to more than 500 followers. Email me at scott@calendartree.com scott@calendartree.com to claim your booty.

If you prefer sports that don’t involve hands or scoring, the FIFA World Cup schedule is also on CalendarTree http://bit.ly/N8iAnK.

CalendarTree http://bit.ly/N8iAnK works for any schedule, not just sports. Create a schedule in CalendarTree http://bit.ly/N8iAnK and you can share a link that lets people add the entire series to their calendars with a few clicks. Try it once and you’ll never want to go back to the old way.
