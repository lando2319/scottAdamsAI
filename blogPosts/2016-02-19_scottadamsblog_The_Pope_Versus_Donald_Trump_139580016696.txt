I could write a long essay about this Pope versus Trump situation, but I think it will be funnier to summarize it instead. What follows is – as far as I can tell – an accurate description of what happened.

> 1. The Pope criticized Donald Trump.
> 
> 2. The Pope’s credibility declined.

If this were fiction, no one would believe it.

I predict that the Pope will issue a public apology to Trump for questioning his faith, as opposed to his policies. [Update: And here it is http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-trump-spokesman-idUSMTZSAPEC2JSUF1DQ, sort of.]
