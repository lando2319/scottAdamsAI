I predicted toward the bottom of this post http://blog.dilbert.com/post/134791529391/risk-management-trump-persuasion-series that Trump was setting up the country for a “mom versus dad” showdown with Clinton – at least in our irrational minds. When election day comes, if the country needs a hug, mom wins. But if there’s a noise downstairs, you probably want dad to get the baseball bat before mom does. (Because you’re a sexist.)

Here’s one of your first tells https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/12/12/how-she-came-love-donald-trump/V0y4HEd6OhCjpLbfFuz91O/story.html that this set-up is coming. You’ll find this quote toward the bottom:

You will see more of this effect when the Clinton vs. Trump face-off becomes exclusive. The voters will keep saying stuff like the quote above until the media reports it. Then everyone will see it. Then it’s all over. 


Keep in mind that terror gets bigger headlines than food stamps, so “Dad” has that natural advantage. But to be fair, if we solve radical Islamic terrorism before November, Hillary Clinton has an excellent chance of winning. 

For the benefit of new readers of this blog, I don’t endorse Trump or anyone else. I’m not smart enough to know who would do the best job of president. Nor am I well-informed on the big issues. My interest is in Trump’s persuasion skills http://blog.dilbert.com/post/126589300371/clown-genius. I have never seen better.
