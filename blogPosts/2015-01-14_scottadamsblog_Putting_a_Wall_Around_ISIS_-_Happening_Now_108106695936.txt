Saudi Arabia has already started building the wall that will someday surround ISIS http://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-is-building-a-600-mile-great-wall-to-shield-from-isis-2015-1 territory so the bad guys can be be cut off from the civilized world.

I blogged about this strategy recently without knowing it was already in the works. No one will say the long range plan is a wall around the entire ISIS-held territory, but I think that is inevitable if the Saudi wall works as well as the Israeli wall did.
