You probably already know that Google famously has a policy encouraging employees to use 20% of their time working on their own ideas for future Google products. 

Today there is an article http://www.businessinsider.com/mayer-google-20-time-does-not-exist-2015-1 about Marissa Mayer, now CEO of Yahoo, admitting that in her Google days the 20% was never real. It actually meant you could do 120% of your job instead of 100% if you really wanted to.

Do you know who already knew the 20% wasn’t real?

Answer: Every person who ever worked for a big company.
