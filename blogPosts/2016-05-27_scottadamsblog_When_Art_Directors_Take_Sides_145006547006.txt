Check out the photos chosen for an article in Business Insider today. On the left, we have Clinton in full-scold mode. I’m sure a better Clinton photo exists. 

On the right, we see the best photo of Trump in the past five years. His hair is evolving to something less wild, and less orange. (His campaign is managing his evolving look, I assume.) And even his tan looks better than usual. He has a fun grin too.

What is the topic of the article? Doesn’t matter. The persuasion already happened. Visual always wins.

Speaking of visual, it turns out that this alleged Clinton ad below is a hoax. But it’s a great hoax because it depends on the public believing Clinton WOULD produce such an ad. This fits her pattern of producing ads that seem more pro-Trump than anti.

Watch how many times Clinton’s ads ask us to imagine President Trump in office. We remember the visual she asks us to imagine and we forget the criticism that follows. Clinton has no trained persuaders on her staff.

When Obama said foreign leaders are “rattled” about a potential President Trump, Trump agreed and amplified the idea to say “rattling in a friendly way http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-world-leaders-theyre-rattled-good-thing/story?id=39400633” is a good thing. It is a component of negotiating. That is persuasion done right, and you have seen Trump do it several times. For example, when accused of being a “whiner,” Trump agreed and amplified it to be the loudest voice for change.

I wouldn’t worry about world leaders being confused about the intent of Trump’s negotiating tactics. They didn’t become world leaders by chance. They understand this stuff.

I’ll be on Bill Maher’s Real Time (HBO) tonight. So will Bernie Sanders. Should I ask him to debate me?

Last year I predicted that this summer you would hear the word “landslide” a lot. It is already starting to creep into online discussions.

If you think this blog has a picture of an annoying bearded guy, you might love my book http://amzn.to/1oTGu8x. It is totally clean-shaven.
