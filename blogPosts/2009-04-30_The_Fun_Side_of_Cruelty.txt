I’m in a photo shoot this afternoon for an upcoming article in Wired. No time for a proper blog entry, but my Google Alert just dredged up a Dilbert-related link that made me laugh out loud. It’s cruel. It’s juvenile. And yet so clever.

Dennis Kneale interviewed me recently during a satellite media tour that I did for my Dilbert 2.0 book . I like him. But I laughed anyway.

Speaking of my big-ol’-coffee table book, Dilbert 2.0, the economy is your friend once again. Thanks to a worldwide slump in book sales, especially on the high end, you can scarf up the best work I have ever done for an embarrassingly low price: http://www.amazon.com/Dilbert-2-0-20-Years/dp/0740777351 http://www.amazon.com/Dilbert-2-0-20-Years/dp/0740777351. It makes a good gift because people will assume it cost more. And when they buy their next gift for you, they might try to match what they think you spent on them and you come out ahead. It’s like free money.
