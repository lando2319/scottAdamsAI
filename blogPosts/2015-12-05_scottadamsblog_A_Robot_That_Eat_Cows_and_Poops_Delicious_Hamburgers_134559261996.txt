According to this article http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-04/robots-made-fast-food-workers-obsolete-now-they-are-coming-after-these-791200-jobs, fast food businesses will soon replace workers with robots that eat cows and poop hamburgers. My advice is to keep your distance from that robot. Stay on the other side of the counter. I don’t know how good its eyesight will be.
