According to Paul Waldman at THEWEEK.COM http://theweek.com/articles/596337/how-donald-trump-schooled-political-pundits, nobody predicted that Trump would be doing so well at the end of 2015.

While I’m on the topic, I’ll add another prediction to the Master Persuader http://blog.dilbert.com/post/126916006856/wizard-warsseries. I predict that by the time Trump is in the general election and running against Clinton, you will start hearing that Trump (Lucky Hitler) http://blog.dilbert.com/post/135324448866/the-lucky-hitler-hypothesis-trump-persuasion is – for all practical purposes – “running unopposed” as Clinton’s poll numbers plummet.

That can happen in a variety of ways. One way is if Clinton’s health or legal issues rise to the point of being disqualifying, and Trump persuades us to think about those things more than we think about anything else. Once you imagine there is one candidate in the race who is eligible and one who might not survive the term, or might be in jail, you start to imagine it as a one-person race.

And you will. That’s how you get a landslide. 

Look for the words “running unopposed” in pundit articles and quotes within a few months of election day. And it still counts if it started here, because it won’t catch on unless it actually fits.
