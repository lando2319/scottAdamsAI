And now I am seriously pissed off that there are so few pending bills. Where is California?

Let me bang out a few comics this morning and circle back to this. You won’t want to miss it because I just chewed through my leash.

Is any U.S. state voting today on doctor-assisted suicide?

Have I mentioned I’m in a bad mood this week?

Please tell me it is on the ballot somewhere.
