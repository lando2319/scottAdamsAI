I’ll be travelling this week, so I don’t know how much blogging I will be doing.

About two years ago I started taking magnesium supplements because I saw something on the Internet that indicated it might help my knees problems. (My knees always hurt after exercise.) The magnesium either worked, or it was a remarkable coincidence, that after 15 years of knee pain it suddenly went away and has stayed away.

Recently I realized I haven’t had any allergy or asthma symptoms for well over a year. For the first time in my life I went through the entire allergy season without so much as a sniffle or a wheeze. And I didn’t even use my allergy or asthma meds. On a hunch, I googled “magnesium allergy” and discovered that doctors sometimes use magnesium to treat asthma attacks. And a magnesium deficiency apparently does promote allergies.

The reader is warned that on the continuum from crackpot to Nobel Price winner, I am much closer to the crackpot side of things. So don’t get your medical advice from me. But if you have allergies, and you decide to take magnesium supplements just to see what happens, let me know how it goes.
