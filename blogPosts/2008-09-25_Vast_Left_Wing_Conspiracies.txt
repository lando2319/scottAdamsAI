Yesterday I found myself in a political discussion that included my very lonely Republican friend. Eyes rolled when he claimed the Clinton administration was to blame for the mortgage fiasco. His argument is that during the Clinton era, lenders were pressured by the government, and by interest groups, to loosen loan standards in order to increase minority home ownership. This strategy reportedly worked splendidly while home prices were increasing. You know the rest of the story.

My Republican friend followed up with a link to an article that I have seen twice in the comments to this blog, so I hereby promote that link to my post:

I’m not persuaded by the article, but neither do I discount it entirely. My problem, as always, is that I don’t have enough knowledge to make a judgment about it. It sounds credible, but that doesn’t mean much.

At best, the pressure to increase minority home ownership was only part of the problem. The executives in the mortgage industry must have known that the increased lending activity would make them even more stinkin’ rich than usual, at least short term. In the long term, they would be living on their yachts. Without the greed angle, the executives might have better resisted what they knew was a risky path.

Second, as Warren Buffett said when he saw all the complicated financial derivatives based on mortgage activity, “My eyebrows are huge!” He didn’t actually say that, but he did warn that trouble was brewing in the derivatives game long before it was obvious to people with normal sized eyebrows. So the exotic and complicated financial derivatives market made a bad situation worse, and that had nothing to do with the liberal agenda.

If there is any truth to the idea that the Clinton administration was a major cause of the mortgage crisis, you have to ask yourself why the media is mostly ignoring that angle. If it isn’t true, does anyone have a link to a rebuttal?
