 



I’m in the (long) process of building a house. The house will have solar panels, but it bugs me that I can’t be off the electric grid entirely. There’s no convenient and economical way to store energy at your own house while the sun is shining. But is that technology imminent?

Some car companies are allegedly coming out with vehicles that operate on compressed air. Here’s one.

How hard would it be to convert that compressed air technology to a home generator? My solar cells could compress air during the day and the compressed air engine would produce electricity at night. There would be plenty of waste in the process, I assume, but it sounds feasible to me.

I’d also like to have a house with two elevators that are balanced so that when one goes down, the other is pulled up. And I would only use the elevators for going down, so my weight causes one side to be heavier than the other. To slow the descent, I’d be compressing air into my home air battery. If you need to go up, you use the stairs. It’s healthier. I’d have a full-power elevator option for the elderly and handicapped, but everyone else would be an energy producer.

Then I’d put the guest bathroom on the second floor so I gain some electricity every time a guest goes to take a whiz. It wouldn’t balance out the water use, but it would make me feel better. And every time my wife or kids asked me where some lost item or other was, I’d say, “I saw it upstairs.”
