Rob Wile at Businessinsider.com http://www.businessinsider.com/dilbert-scott-adams-on-financial-markets-2013-3 asked me to clarify my prediction of a 20% stock market correction in 2013. (See my post below.) So I tapped out the following message on my smartphone:

—- Start —-

“I’m glad you had the wisdom to get a cartoonist’s opinion on global financial markets. 
 
The 20% estimate is based on the fact that 20 is a big round number and more likely to happen than 30%. I don’t like to over-think these things. 
 
My reasoning is that the people at the highest levels of finance are brilliant people who chose a profession with the credibility of astrology. And they know it. Then they sell their advice to people who don’t know it. So that’s your cast of characters. 
 
Now consider that the characters - who are literally geniuses in many cases - have an immense financial motive, opportunity, and a near-zero risk of getting caught. How do you think that plays out?

We can only give a guess of the odds that the market is being manipulated. So I ask myself: How often does the fox leave the hen house because he feels that taking an egg would be wrong?
 
If you have a different answer from mine, I applaud your faith in human nature.”
