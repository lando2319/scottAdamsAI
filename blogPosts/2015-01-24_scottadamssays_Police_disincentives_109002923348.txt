What if law enforcement had an economic incentive to solve crime?

Now we have a disincentive in place.

The focus today is on how do I rest this guy in front of me without getting hurt and perhaps how do I make my neighborhood safer. But there is really no incentive to reduce crime overall because after all criminals are the raw materials of your profession and if the criminals go away so do the law-enforcement jobs.

So what would happen if law-enforcement had a economic incentive to reduce crime? Could you design a model that worked without making something else for worse?
