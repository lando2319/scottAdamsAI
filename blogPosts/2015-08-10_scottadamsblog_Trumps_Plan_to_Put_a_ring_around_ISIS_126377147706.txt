Presidential candidate Donald Trump said today that he would “put a ring around ISIS” and take the oil http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/10/us-usa-election-trump-mideast-idUSKCN0QF1BB20150810, thus recouping some war costs and starving them of their resources at the same time.

I have no idea if that is a good plan or a bad plan. But in my 2004 book, The Religion War http://www.amazon.com/Religion-War-Scott-Adams-ebook/dp/B00HFYD8DK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=, I predicted that the the major powers would build a wall around the caliphate and starve it. And in July I updated that idea with the Filter Fence concept you can read here http://blog.dilbert.com/post/122942821056/update-on-the-isis-filter-fence.

You can mock Trump all you want, and I plan to do plenty of that myself, but his plan is worthy of being in the debate.

If you don’t like the “ring around it” plan, please put in the comments the plan that you prefer and the names of the candidates that support it. I am not up to date on any better ideas but I hope there are some.
