Regular reader Phantom raised an interesting question: How do I know I’ve ever written or said anything that made a positive difference in anyone’s life? Did anyone ever get richer, happier, or healthier because of anything I ever wrote? How would I know?

Over the years people have thanked me on a surprisingly regular basis, usually by email, for inspiring them to one sort of success or another. Usually it’s based on something I wrote in a book, newspaper article, or in this blog. Sometimes it’s because of a speech I gave somewhere. But I figure everyone in the public eye gets those sorts of thank-you messages. I assume the local TV weatherman gets email every day from viewers thanking him for giving them the courage to carry on no matter the weather. So I discount my personal experience as relevant to answering the question of whether I’ve ever done anything useful. I’m a biased observer and I can’t trust those suspiciously thankful strangers. I need better data.

So I thought I’d put the question to you. Has anything I’ve ever written had a positive impact on your life beyond the momentary entertainment of consuming it? I’m looking for something bigger than it “put me in a good mood” or “made me think in a different way.”

I’m asking if you’ve ever tried something you wouldn’t have otherwise tried, and it worked out well, because of something I said or wrote.

This is clearly not scientific, but if there’s no trace of benefit in the group that follows this blog, I wouldn’t expect a better result in the general public.
