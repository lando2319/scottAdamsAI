Today I learned that ex-BBC presenter Jimmy Savile allegedly had sex with corpses http://www.businessinsider.com/jimmy-savile-nhs-report-sex-with-dead-bodies-rings-made-from-glass-eyes-2014-6 while he was a young man working in a hospital mortuary.

This raises many questions.

For starters, is this an isolated situation or a widespread problem? To be on the safe side, I called my lawyer and revised my estate plan. Now it says that within an hour of my death I want my mouth and my ass sewed shut. But I’m not entirely unsympathetic to the needs of mortuary workers, so I requested that my left hand be positioned in a semi-clasped position before rigor mortis kicks in.

There’s a chance that this is more of a British problem than a United States thing. I think we’d all agree that it’s a slippery slope from warm beer and soccer hooliganism to skull-fucking the dead. Once you get some inertia going on the bad behavior it’s hard to put the brakes on. I get that.

There’s no mention of whether the corpses were the attractive type, but I’m guessing most were not. So I think you have to give Jimmy some credit for not buying into society’s Photoshopped sense of beauty.

You also have to consider the celebrity angle. Jimmy wasn’t famous when the events allegedly happened, but if you take the long view of things, any kind of sex with a TV celebrity is sort of special. If you were to tell me in the afterlife that a total nobody defiled my corpse, I’d be pissed. But if you said that my lifeless shell had rough sex with a mortuary worker who later became Alex Trebek, I’d feel some pride in that. I might even brag to the other angels “I still got it.” (I’m assuming God doesn’t read my blog so I still have a chance to get into Heaven with a well-timed deathbed conversion.)

I also have to wonder if the ghosts of the corpses Jimmy rejected for sex are angrier than the ones who saw some action. I mean, it already sucks to be dead, but to get rejected by an alleged bisexual, pedophile, corpse-banger has to sting. This guy was probably corn-holing feral cats - including the dead ones. I’d hate to think my cadaver wasn’t good enough to make the cut. That would make me a sad ghost, and no one wants that.

This situation makes me wonder where the phrase “Not over my dead body” originated. Now I think it might have started as a sentence fragment on an employee sign in an English mortuary, three lines down from “All employees must wash their hands after using the restroom.”

There are lots more questions but I have to do some work. Maybe you can think of a few to add.
