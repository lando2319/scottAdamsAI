Humanity does not have an option of staying the same in hoping everything works out in the long run. The nature of our environment is that it is subject to change if you wait long enough. Eventually the sunburns I don’t to use an extreme example. But long before that one would expect any manner of Celeste deal in atmospheric problem to pop up of the type that could wipe out humanity.

So wouldn’t it be good if we started early to develop the technologies that allow us to quickly scramble and it just too large plantet-wide changes in the distribution of energy and resources.

Leave me a change could be the perfect situation. In the sentence it’s a relatively slow moving disaster. And that means we have a good fighting chance to adjust without taking a mortal wound. And once we develop technologies for adjusting to climate change I would think we be as a side effect more prepared for and the other huge planetary disaster such as a comet strike or a plague or anything that makes people move from one place to another.

If climate change is what causes us to rapidly learn how to get freshwater to all the places it is needed and to generate clean energy then don’t we come out ahead?

Remember to include my disclaimer on this post.

I would think that climate change is more likely to be a boon to poor people then a problem. I base that prediction on the fact that poor people are forced to live on and own the worst property in the worst places. If the rich farmers in one place lose money you’re probably gets redistributed to someplace that once was poor but now can become prosperous through agriculture or tourism.

I am not predicting this will happen. I am saying that if you believe one likelihood is more likely than the other you are not using data to make that determination.
