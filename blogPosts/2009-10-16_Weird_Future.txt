From an Article in the New York Times, here is one of the coolest theories I’ve ever heard that isn’t already an episode for Star Trek. This quote sums it up:

“A pair of otherwise distinguished physicists have suggested that the hypothesized Higgs boson, which physicists hope to produce with the (Large Hadron) collider, might be so abhorrent to nature that its creation would ripple backward through time and stop the collider before it could make one, like a time traveler who goes back in time to kill his grandfather.”

Obviously the phrase “abhorrent to nature” has no precise meaning in science. So I figure if we’re tossing out sensational interpretations I should add one of my own. As regular readers of this blog know, I believe our reality is a holographic simulation, and you and I are just software running within it. Our creator, or creators, who presumably had bodies like ours, made this simulated universe so they could live forever, in a fashion, because their own reality was about to be annihilated in some sort of cosmic catastrophe. Or maybe we’re someone’s seventh grade science project. The point is that we only think we are real because that’s how we were programmed.

Or if you prefer a less “Superman’s exploding planet” version of that idea, from someone with more credibility than me, check out Boltzmann’s Brain theory:  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/science/15brain.html http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/science/15brain.html

If we are a software program, we might be constrained, perhaps by rules of the program, to stay within certain parameters of enlightenment. For example, we might be restricted from discovering that our reality is a simulation. And the Large Hadron Collider might be testing the limits of our allowed enlightenment. So you might expect some paradoxical, illogical, frightening thing to happen when knowledge starts to approach the programmed forbidden zone of knowing.

But apparently speculation about our software simulation reality is still allowed by the program as long as you mock me in your comments to prevent the idea from spreading.
