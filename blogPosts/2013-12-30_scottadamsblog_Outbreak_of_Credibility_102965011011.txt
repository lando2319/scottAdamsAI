I’m having a sudden outbreak of unwarranted credibility and it has me worried.

Dennis Miller recently interviewed me on his radio show http://www.dennismillerradio.com/b/An-Empire-Built-on-Modest-Skills/527123239176069643.html and he had a lot of nice things to say about my new book, How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big http://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1591846919/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1376677690&sr=1-1&keywords=how%20to%20fail%20at%20almost%20everything%20and%20still%20win%20big.

Paul Farrell, over at MarketWatch, reprinted my personal investment advice http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dilberts-investing-gift-for-last-minute-shoppers-2013-12-23 that has been floating around the Internet. The same list is also included in the most recent update of the classic personal investment book The Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Princeton professor of economics, Burton Malkiel.

As I mentioned in the last post, the Wall Street Journal http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/12/28/the-best-financial-advice-from-22-big-names/?mod=MW_latest_newslumped me together with famous people who actually know things.

In my book, The Dilbert Future, I coined the term “confusopoly” to describe companies in the same industry that confuse customers so much with their marketing that it isn’t necessary to compete on price. The term caught on in Australia and has become a rallying cry against phone companies http://www.industrysearch.com.au/Telco-consumers-are-living-in-confusopoly-regulator/n/51881 and their misleading advertising.

I recently released God’s Debris on Kindle http://amzn.to/1eogSpL. Several years ago, after its softcover publishing run, I made the book available for free on the Internet. But folks have been asking for a Kindle version for convenience. A surprising number of people call God’s Debris the best book they have ever read. The sequel, The Religion War http://www.amazon.com/The-Religion-War-Scott-Adams/dp/0740747886, is based on a not-far future in which terrorists use small, home-built GPS-guided drones to attack population centers. That prediction is already coming true http://ideas.time.com/2013/01/31/criminals-and-terrorists-can-fly-drones-too/, and I wanted the Kindle version of God’s Debris to be available when this sort of attack becomes a daily headline.

Someone asked me how many non-Dilbert books I’ve written. In this context, “non-Dilbert” means it is mostly original writing but might include some comics for humor relief within chapters. Here’s the list.

The Dilbert Principle http://www.amazon.com/The-Dilbert-Principle-Cubicles-Eye-Afflictions/dp/0887308589/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1 (workplace humor)

How to Fail Almost Every Time and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of my Life http://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1591846919/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1376677690&sr=1-1&keywords=how%20to%20fail%20at%20almost%20everything%20and%20still%20win%20big (memoir/success)

Those books have everything you need to know about humor, careers, finance, religion, health, and success. If I left out anything, let me know and I’ll write another book.
