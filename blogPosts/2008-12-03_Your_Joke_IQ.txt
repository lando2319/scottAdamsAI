I’m one of those people who can’t remember my own address half the time (true) but I can remember a joke forever. I will now test your joke I.Q. by giving you some punchlines and you can see how many of them you recognize from the joke.

1. It’s not so funny when it’s YOUR mother, is it?

2. Tuesday is your day in the barrel.

3. Would you hold this camel for me?

4. Keep the tip.

How did you do?
