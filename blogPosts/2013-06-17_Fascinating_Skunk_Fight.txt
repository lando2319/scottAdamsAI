Over at The Bearded Taint’s blog http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/06/17/the-saga-of-scott-adams-scrotum/comment-page-1/#comment-638528, the citizens have lit torches, grabbed pitchforks and come after me (again). I don’t think I have seen more concentrated hate in one place. It’s actually quite fascinating from a mental health perspective.

I left my own comments on the Bearded Taint’s blog if you want to follow along.

The interesting thing is that I’m reasonably sure my haters and I have exactly the same opinions on the topics they are getting worked up about. But once the Internet decides you are a holocaust-denying, creationist, science-hating, sexist, sock puppet, all evidence seems to support that view. And in this case, these science-loving folks are basing their views on rumors, stuff taken out of context, misinterpretations, faulty memory of stuff they once read but don’t fully remember, and that sort of thing.

I’ll say it again because it is so interesting: The people who are hating me because of my opinions have exactly the same opinions. They just don’t realize it because of the fog of confirmation bias.

I’m totally guilty of blogging in a way that was guaranteed to get this sort of reaction. I’ll own that. I think there is an audience for people who are willing to play with ideas and not take any of it too seriously. The problem is that I become a target for advocates who need well-known enemies, manufactured or real. But I do understand that is part of my chosen profession. It’s more fascinating than annoying. I love watching normally rational people get spun out of their minds by The Bearded Taint and his type.
