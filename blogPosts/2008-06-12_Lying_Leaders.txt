Is it ever okay for your leaders to lie to you if they genuinely believe it is in the best interest of the country?

Personally, I’m okay with that, even if it turns out to be a colossal mistake. All I ask is that smart people did their best to get it right. Hey, no one is perfect.
That’s why I can’t generate any genuine anger toward our current bumbling government despite the fact they killed hundreds of thousands of people, steered the economy into a ravine, and ruined two hundred years of International good will. I actually think they were trying to do the right thing as they saw it. And if they weren’t smart enough, the voters have to be blamed for that. Our politicians didn’t get any dumber after being elected. We knew what we were getting.
I don’t think I’m alone in my opinion. Otherwise we’d be in the middle of the impeachment process.
