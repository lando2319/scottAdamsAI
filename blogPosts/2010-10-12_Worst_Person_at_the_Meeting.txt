Think about the most recent meeting you attended. Leave a comment below describing the worst person at the meeting. Be as unkind as you like.

In this context, “worst” could mean anything, such as most disruptive, dumbest, craziest, slowest talker, or anything else that drives you crazy.

Yes, I will be mining the comments for Dilbert comic fodder. Thank you in advance. But I think it will also be funny in its own right.
