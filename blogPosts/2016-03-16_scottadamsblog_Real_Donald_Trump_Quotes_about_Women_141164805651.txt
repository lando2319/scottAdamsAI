Have you seen the anti-Trump video https://pjmedia.com/election/2016/03/14/anti-trump-ad-women-reading-donalds-quotes-about-women/2/ that features women quoting Donald Trump’s most offensive statements about women? 

I just showed it to a woman. She thought it was funny. Apparently nothing that Trump says comes off as offensive to her. 

The reason I checked with a woman is because I didn’t trust my own reaction. To me, the video looked like the most tone-deaf ad of all time. I would rank it as among the worst I have ever seen in terms of persuasion. I’m guessing it worked in Trump’s favor.

On the 2D level of reality – where we pretend people are rational – the video makes perfect sense. The makers of the video figured women voters would not like a candidate that says bad things about women. That seems totally logical. I can see why they made the video.

But on the 3D level of persuasion, what the viewer sees is several average-looking women in bad moods complaining about a guy being, well…  a guy. I assume men won’t be offended by the video because Trump is no more of a jerk than most men. And men probably don’t get a warm feeling from the judgmental, angry messengers in the video. That video looks like a huge fail to me.

But I’m curious how other people react to it. In the comments, tell me your gender and your reaction to the video. Show the video to a coworker if you can, and watch the reaction.

I predict that 85% of women and 95% of men simply think it is funny and they end up with a more positive image of Trump as a person who says whatever he is thinking. That quality has almost universal appeal on an interpersonal level.

Am I wrong?
