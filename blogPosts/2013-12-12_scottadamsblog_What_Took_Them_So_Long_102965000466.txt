They could have just asked me.


I’m finishing my book tour in NYC today.  Only one major embarrassment so far. The host of Bloomberg News, Pimm Fox, randomly opened my book and asked me to elaborate on a fairly unimportant page I wrote over a year ago. I had to confess on live TV that I didn’t remember part of my own book. Ouch.
