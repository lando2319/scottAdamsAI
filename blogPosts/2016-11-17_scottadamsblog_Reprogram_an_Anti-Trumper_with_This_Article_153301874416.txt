It would take me too long to explain why this article http://bit.ly/2f3iTxB about Trump, by Scott Alexander, is so important to you and to the country. Stop whatever you are doing and give it ten minutes. 

Seriously. Stop what you are doing. Give this ten minutes. It’s more important that almost anything you were going to do today.

Then save the link for later sharing. Show it to all of your friends who think Trump is a racist monster. This ends it.

The only people who will think Trump is a racist going forward are people who haven’t read this article. If you find someone like that, send them the link. This piece is a brilliant service to the country. Breathtaking.
