Now hobby-sized drones can fly for up to two hours on solid fuel pellets. Read about it here http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/139143451756/top-tech-204-largest-aircraft-widest-glider. This technology isn’t yet commercial, but it probably will be in several years.

I don’t know how far a hobby-sized drone can fly in two hours. And I don’t know how hard it would be to program one to fly from wherever you are to a specific GPS location. But when those two technologies come together, how do you stop a weaponized suicide drone from attacking literally anywhere on Earth?
