Check out my blog post from August 10th http://bit.ly/2b6fvEo on the “surprises” that could cause Trump to come from behind and win. At the time, Clinton was well ahead in the polls, thanks to a convention bounce and the Khan situation. I noted at the time that the likely “surprises” favored Trump.


How’d I do?
