Do you remember my blog post about building a giant canal system in the U.S. as a way to create jobs in our robot-driven future?


It was officially the worst idea I’ve ever had, according to most of you.


Technically, it was just the worst idea I’ve ever shared. You wouldn’t believe the crap that swirls around inside my skull and never gets out. But that’s another story.


One of the biggest objections to my canal plan was that there are too many mountains in the way. But it turns out there’s a natural network of connected rivers http://www.businessinsider.com/two-ocean-pass-2014-4 that go from the Pacific to the Atlantic already. That’s a start.


Clearly we’d need a lot of dredging. But plotting the path for the first major leg of the canal might be done.


Okay, I know you still don’t like the canal idea. But this is a reminder that it’s never safe to assume something is impossible or impractical. I’m having flashbacks to the time I was putting together my sample comics to try and become a syndicated cartoonist. Most of my friends imagined that plan to be impossible for the obvious reason that I wasn’t good at drawing. I got more looks of sympathy than support.


It’s always a good idea to let reality be your only obstacle. Your imagination shouldn’t be the limit on your success.
