Humor Dimensions: Recognition, mean, clever, bizarre

Brevity: Good (could lose the word “have” in first panel)

Inappropriateness: High (bathroom humor)

Predicted Twitter Response: Expect lots of retweets despite bathroom humor because the message about nutrition is important to folks and the naughtiness is softened by the silliness of it.

[Update: Typo in last frame corrected]

Update 3/29/15: I predicted lots of retweets despite the naughtiness of this comic because I assumed folks would agree with the message about nutrition. No one is on the other side of that issue. As predicted, this was a strong performer. Only a few of my tweets have had this many retweets.

Key Learning: You can get away with naughtiness if you don’t use actual naughty words and the message is otherwise positive.
