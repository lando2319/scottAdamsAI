You probably already know that Google famously has a policy encouraging employees to use 20% of their time working on their own ideas for future Google products. 

Today there is an article  http://www.businessinsider.com/mayer-google-20-time-does-not-exist-2015-1about Marissa Mayer, now CEO of Yahoo, admitting that in her Google days the 20% was never real. It actually meant Google expected you to do 100% of your job plus another 20%.

Do you know who already knew the 20% wasn’t real?

Answer: Every person who ever worked for a big company.
