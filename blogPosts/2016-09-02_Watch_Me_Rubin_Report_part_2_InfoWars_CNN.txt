Here is the second part https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3BQGwESVbU of my appearance on the Rubin Report, in which I talk about Trump and persuasion.

Here is my interview http://www.infowars.com/dilbert-creator-still-predicts-landslide-trump-win/ with Alex Jones on Infowars.

Watch me live today (Friday) on CNN, sometime around 3:10 PM EST. (But times might change before then.)

Bonus 1: As a companion to what I said on the Rubin Report, here http://ow.ly/OeOg303P8zt is more scientific evidence that we are not rational beings. We are beings who rationalize after the fact.

Bonus 2: A USA Today poll http://usat.ly/2bFmtwl says fear is the greatest motivator this election. As I have been saying.
