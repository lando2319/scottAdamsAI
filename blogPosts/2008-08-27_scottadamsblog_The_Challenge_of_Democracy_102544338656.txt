The results of my survey of economists will be published in mid September. It’s going to take longer than I thought to swim through the data and pull out the good stuff. And I have been advised by smart people that this week is a bad one to compete for attention in the news.  I can tell you that I’ve seen the raw results and there will be surprises.

Let’s do a little experiment here. I asked economists to rank issues by how important they are to the economy. I’m asking you the same thing now. In the comments, tell us what you think is the number one issue for the United States from an ECONOMIC perspective.

I’m guessing your answers will be all over the place, and that says a lot about the challenge of democracy. If you don’t know which issue is most important to the economy, it’s hard to know which candidate would do the best job.

In your view, what is the most important issue for the economy?
