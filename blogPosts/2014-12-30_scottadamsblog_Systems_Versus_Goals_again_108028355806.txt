Those of you who were nice enough to read my latest book (How to Fail… http://amzn.to/1dF0EJK) will recognize my writing as the uncredited source material for this video http://www.businessinsider.com/why-you-should-forget-setting-goals-2014-11. The credit information probably got separated from the product at some point. 

In any event, the systems-versus-goals idea seems to be taking on a life of its own. I like that.
