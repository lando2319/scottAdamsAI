My editor thinks this comic is inappropriate for newspapers. He might be right. You won’t see this one published anywhere else.

One of the tricks I use as a comic writer is the imaginary last scene. In this case, the funny part is what you imagine happening after the comic is over. Your mind fills in the details. If I do my job right, everyone fills in the last scene with whatever works best for them. Some of you imagine something subtle and some of you have a more graphic interpretation. Personally, I see a time-lapse scenario that features bulging eyes and seasons changing. The important thing is that each of you imagines a scene that is customized to your sensibilities.
