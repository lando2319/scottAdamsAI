My thoughts today are with the victims in Orlando and the LGBT community at large. It is too early for me to write about this tragedy in a political context, but two of my past blog posts are, sadly, relevant to understanding what will come next. They are both worth revisiting.

On December 8th, 2015, I wrote this blog post http://blog.dilbert.com/post/134791529391/risk-management-trump-persuasion-series.

On March 23rd of this year, I wrote this http://blog.dilbert.com/post/141545899386/sleeper-persuasion-with-a-triggerÂ post to better explain what I call sleeper persuasion with a trigger.

Stay safe.
