Can everyone see all three strips on all browsers?

Okay, I finally said screw it and created a new blog over at Wordpress. And by that I mean I attempted to open an account but …. wait for it… their system is either down or rejecting me personally.

The universe is clearly conspiring to prevent me from showing these three images to the public. This is the sort of thing that makes me think we’re software simulations and not free creatures in a real world.

I’m open to suggestions. Can anyone suggest a way to display images on the Internet? I’ve heard it’s a thing.
