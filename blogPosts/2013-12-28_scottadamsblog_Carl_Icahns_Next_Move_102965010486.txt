This is weird…

The Wall Street Journal asked some “prominent” people about the best financial advice they ever got. My quote appeared on the list next to Carl Icahn’s quote http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/12/28/the-best-financial-advice-from-22-big-names/?mod=MW_latest_news, which is weird enough. but weirder still, my quote involved practical financial advice whereas Icahn’s quote was intentionally hilarious. I see it as the first move in what will probably be Icahn’s unfriendly takeover of Dilbert.

Damn, he’s good.
