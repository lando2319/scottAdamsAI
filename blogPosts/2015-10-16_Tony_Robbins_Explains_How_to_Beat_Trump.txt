If you have been following my Master Wizard Hypothesis http://blog.dilbert.com/post/126916006856/wizard-wars series, you know I called Tony Robbins https://www.google.com/search?q=tony+robbins&rlz=1C1SKPL_enUS421US509&oq=tony+robbins&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j69i59.1905j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8 the best hypnotist in the world. His job is motivating people to improve their lives, and apparently he is amazing at it. His persuasion skills trace back to famous hypnotist Milton Erickson, same as mine. Robbins has added lots of layers to that learning, but his understanding of how people are influenced is similar to my world view, and probably quite different from yours.


Many of you have asked me how to design a Linguistic Kill Shot https://reason.com/reasontv/2015/10/06/donald-trump-is-a-master-wizard that would take out Trump. I keep saying I don’t know how, because his defenses are so solid. His Trump persona can shake off almost anything.

But what does Tony Robbins think? Business Insider asked Robbins how Trump’s opponents can beat him. Listen to Robbins’ answer http://www.businessinsider.com/tony-robbins-how-to-defeat-donald-trump-2015-10 and tell me who he expects to be our next president.

Convinced yet?
