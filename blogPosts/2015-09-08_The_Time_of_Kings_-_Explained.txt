This post is a spoiler (and explanation) for my post The Time of Kings http://blog.dilbert.com/post/128334919441/the-time-of-kings. You should read that post first.

After seeing the comments to my whimsical post about wizards in the time of kings, I am reminded that some of you subscribe to what I would call the “Wimpy Jesus” view of history.


Wimpy Jesus – should such a person have actually existed – would have said some version of “Turn the other cheek” because he wanted to avoid violence to others, even at great personal risk. For Wimpy Jesus, it is all about not fighting.

I subscribe to the Bad-ass Jesus view of history. In that view, “Turn the other cheek” was a call to psychological warfare as a way to prevail against a stronger enemy. And it was a reminder that an individual can topple governments with a good enough game. If the meek want to conquer the earth, Jesus was laying out the game plan.

To me, turn the other cheek means you should do the unexpected. Get into your opponents head. Then win. It was a huge mental shift for humans, to imagine that the mind is more powerful than the sword.

That’s bad-ass Jesus. I like that guy. He showed in four words (give or take some translations and maybe some co-authors) that power is in the mind, not the sword. Consider how big a deal that was in a time where force was everything. 

[Update: I wrote my interpretation before seeing a link in the comments that at least one historian agrees it was psychological warfare http://dharmagates.org/other_cheek.html.]

In the second half of my post about The Time of Kings, I said five kings rose at about the same time. You wondered who they are, and why only five.

I picked five  because it had to be at least that many. And I chose an odd number because it helps with tie-breaking votes in small groups. Having lived in this world, I know that more than five wizards just makes things harder, not better. So five is a rational guess. 

But certainly Franklin, Jefferson, Madison, and Washington are in. I left one space for imagination. 

So why is “We the people” such a powerful statement in three words?

It says the people can unite as one power, without a call to a leader. It was an amazing thought for the time. We take it for granted now. That’s why it might seem trite to some of you. But it was a huge mental shift about the nature of humans. 

If the Wizard pattern holds, the next wizard would have reduced the code to two words. And those two words would be what the world needs at this point in history to advance our understanding of who we are as human beings.

I nominate these two words https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot.


[UPDATE: WITH THIS POST AND THE RELATED ONES I WROTE ON THE TOPIC OF PERSUASION, I HAVE ACCIDENTALLY WRITTEN THE PREQUEL TO GOD’S DEBRIS http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Debris-A-Thought-Experiment-ebook/dp/B00HFYD8E4/ref=pd_sim_351_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0DY29N6YNGW7N31W2PJR&dpSrc=sims&dpST=_AC_UL320_SR232%2C320_ AND ITS SEQUEL THE RELIGION WAR http://www.amazon.com/The-Religion-War-Scott-Adams-ebook/dp/B00HFYD8DK/ref=pd_sim_351_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0KZBENCRZJ64DXV42S0D&dpSrc=sims&dpST=_AC_UL320_SR230%2C320_. 
ROUND IT ALL OFF WITH MY BOOK ABOUT YOUR MOIST ROBOT SELF (HOW TO FAIL ALMOST EVERY TIME AND STILL WIN BIG http://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4/ref=pd_sim_351_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=1CQKVHF5KJQZ8HMVBY35&dpSrc=sims&dpST=_AC_UL320_SR208%2C320_) AND YOU HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW OF REALITY THAT EXPLAINS THE TRUMP PHENOMENON. I DON’T PRESENT THIS FILTER AS TRUTH. I JUST THINK IT IS FUN TO COMPARE ITS PREDICTIVE POWER TO WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING BEFORE. I REMIND YOU THAT THIS BLOG IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT ONLY.]

The accidental connecting theme is the hypothesis that a small group of linguistic wizards control all of the big events in the world and always have, using the power of words that are engineered to rewire the irrational brains of the moist robots who believe they have free will. And you can be a wizard. 

Or maybe reality is the thing that you believe. Could be that too. Let’s see which one explains the past and makes the best predictions. 

I remind you this is just for fun. The connections across those books is accidental. They just happen to fit together in an alternative universe sort of way.
