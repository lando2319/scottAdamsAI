What do you think of this actor, Adam DeVine http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2796745/?ref_=nmmd_md_nm, to play Dilbert in a live-action movie?



He’s quickly becoming one of my favorite comedy talents. He’s the right age and look too.


I’m hoping to write a  Dilbert movie script this summer and it helps to have an actor in mind even if the actor isn’t aware of it.


[Update: Please stop saying Drew Carey in the comments. He would have been ideal about 20 years ago. The story I have in mind is more of an origin story in which we see a younger Dilbert freshly into the cubicle world. He would age in sequels.]
