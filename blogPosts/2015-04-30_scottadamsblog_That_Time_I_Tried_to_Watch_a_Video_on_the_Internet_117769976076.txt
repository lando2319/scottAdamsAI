About ten times a day I see a link on the Internet to a video clip that looks interesting or newsworthy. I usually click that link because apparently I am incapable of learning from experience.

As you know, videos on the Internet sometimes crash your device. Sometimes they start but never play to completion because of traffic loads. 

Sometimes there is no video to be found at the end of the links. 

Sometimes intrusive ads disguised as videos create too many decoys and I give up searching for the real one on the page.

And sometimes the video clips start with ads that are longer than my attention span. I bail out after 5 seconds of nothingness to get on with my life.

People say videos on the Internet are awesome. I hope to someday see one. Have any of you ever seen one? Do the images move the entire time, like television?

Soon your eyeglasses will be able to read your emotion http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/117737979371/top-tech-48-glasses-detect-emotions-phone-scanss. That’s more than I can do already. I hope those glasses never learn to pretend they are interested in what you are saying because that’s my only remaining advantage.

And how about a smartphone attachment that can see your DNA http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/117737979371/top-tech-48-glasses-detect-emotions-phone-scans? That could come in handy because I like my women with a little extra neanderthal in them and I don’t want to be disappointed later.

A new camera can record frames so fast http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/117737979371/top-tech-48-glasses-detect-emotions-phone-scans that someday my video security system will be able to see the Human Flash rummage through my refrigerator when I am asleep. I know he’s down there, but so far he has gotten away with it. No more!
