For example, as you know, nothing is more boring than listening to another person talk about the dream he had last night. Therefore, you would assume, a comic that is nothing but an account of a stranger’s dream should be the most uninteresting comic in the universe. And yet it isn’t.

Artist Jesse Reklaw turns people’s dreams into four-panel comics on the Internet. They have no coherent story line and no punch lines. If you read only one, you would probably scratch your head and wonder what he was smoking. But if you read several it feels like accessing the dream part of your brain while being awake. It’s the strangest sensation. Check it out.
