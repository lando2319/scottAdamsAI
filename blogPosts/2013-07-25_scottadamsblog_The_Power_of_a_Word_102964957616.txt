In reaction to my prior post about Trayvon Martin, a reader here named Happy left a comment that is so well-worded I’m going to reproduce it below. The central brilliance of Happy’s writing is that he substituted an unloaded word for a loaded word and it transformed the argument. I even like his choices for line spacing and pacing. And check out the word economy; nothing wasted.

I’m not endorsing Happy’s opinion. I’m just impressed by the persuasiveness of his writing. In Happy’s words…

“When I buy a can of Coke, I see the label, and I know what to expect.

Stereotypes are wrong of course. But brands are good.

So if there are a bunch of people that dress a certain way, and act a certain way, they are creating a brand for themselves.

There’s a nerd brand. There’s a metro-sexual brand. There’s a jock brand, a cheerleader brand, a gothic brand… I can go on but of course you know what I mean.

Then there is a gangster brand.

This may be shocking, but if you dress like a gangster - talk like a gangster - and ride around in a car like a gangster, people are bound to pick up on the brand you’re showcasing.

I suppose it could be related to race - but I don’t think so. I can have the above stereotypes in any race - no problem.

If you want to be treated like a nerd, dress like a nerd. You want to be treated like a gangster, knock yourself out, and dress and act like a bad-ass.

But when you do, don’t get upset when people react to the brand you’re pushing.

Does that make it right for someone to beat you up because you’re a nerd, or shoot you in cold blood because you look like a gangster? Hell no - of course not.

But on the other hand - if you dress like a respectable member of society, the chance of getting treated better is certainly going to be higher.

So why bother acting like a bad-ass?

I don’t get it.

I’m not going to get into the specifics of this case - that’s not the point. The important thing to remember for us and our families is that it’s important to portray the right, positive brand. It won’t hurt to make the world a better place, now will it?

So put away the gangster image. Don’t do it - and don’t let your family do it. The world will be a better place for it.”

Someone famous once said, “You’re not a writer until a writer tells you you’re a writer.” You’re a writer, Happy. But I suspect you already do that for a living.
