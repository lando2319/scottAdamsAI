Who would you be most interested in hearing me interview on a podcast in 2016? 

1. Donald Trump

2. Jihadist

3. Feminist who hates me

4. An open border/amnesty proponent

5. NRA official

6. Christian fundamentalist

7. Famous business person (your choice)

I don’t have solid plans for a podcast, but will probably dabble in the coming months. If anyone has podcast software suggestions, this would be a good time to tell me. Thanks!
