I’m planning to do a week of blogging on the topic of success, as part of a lead up to the release of my book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life. http://www.amazon.com/Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=

And so I wondered if you’d like to cue me up with specific topics in the area of success/failure. Is there any accepted wisdom in that field that you’d like to see confirmed or destroyed?
