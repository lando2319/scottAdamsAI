Next week (Dec 16 - 20) I’ll be doing interviews on Skype and phone about my new book (How to Fail almost Every time and Still Win Big… http://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1591846919/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1376677690&sr=1-1&keywords=how+to+fail+at+almost+everything+and+still+win+big).

But I’m adding a twist to the process, just to see what happens.

I’ll do the interviews in the priority order of biggest reach. So if no one but a high school newspaper asks for an interview, I’ll do it. For next week only, no media outlet is too small. I’ll do as many as I can fit into my schedule.

If you’re interested in talking to me next week (or sooner), just email me at dilbertcartoonist@gmail.com dilbertcartoonist@gmail.com and tell me roughly how big your audience reach is. Send me your Skype ID and/or phone number. I’ll either call you when I have a minute or email to arrange a time.

You don’t even need to be a professional writer. You just need a way to distribute the interview within your company or organization.

My guess is that I’ll end up talking to just about everyone who asks. I don’t have an assistant answering my email. I’ll read everything that comes in, but I might not be able to respond to all of it.

Perhaps I’ll be speaking with you soon. This should be fun.
