In the spirit of the holiday season, I give each of you permission to brag about anything incredible that you, or a loved one or family member, are working on. For this post only, all of the social conventions about bragging are suspended. Let your awesomeness shine.

Leave a comment telling the world about your incredible startup that will change the world, the amazing goals you accomplished, the awards you won, the victories you enjoyed, the degrees you completed, and anything else that your good upbringing would normally suppress. And don’t leave out the glowing prose.

If you have links to support your claims of wonderfulness, let’s see them. (I’m looking at you, Raskolnikov.)
