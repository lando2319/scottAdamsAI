A reader caught me using the same joke twice. See today’s Dilbert:  http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2009-02-04 /strips/comic/2009-02-04


Then check out the comic I drew way back on 3/13/95.

I never repeat intentionally, but I often get a nagging feeling that something looks vaguely familiar. That’s probably because the human mind is tuned to recognize patterns, and almost everything you see reminds you of something you already saw.

I suppose I’m most prone to repeating a line spoken by Dogbert because his voice is the one that plays in my mind all day. He says the things I am thinking but could never say in polite company. When someone tells me they got a “new position” at work, what I say aloud is “Congratulations!” But what I think in the deepest Dogbert part of my brain is “Grabbing your ankles?”

Okay, that’s three times I’ve used that same joke. Ithink it’s out of my system now.
