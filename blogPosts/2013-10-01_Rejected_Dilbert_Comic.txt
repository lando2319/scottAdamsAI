On another topic, my new book, How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life http://www.amazon.com/Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1379516689, will be released October 22nd but you can preorder on Amazon.
