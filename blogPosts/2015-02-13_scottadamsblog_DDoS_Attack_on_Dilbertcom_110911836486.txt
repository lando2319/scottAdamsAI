Okay, whoever launched the DDoS attack on the Dilbert.com servers this morning has to come forward, anonymously if you prefer, and tell me your motives. Just leave a comment here if you feel that is safe enough.

Iâ€™m hoping the attack came from female hackers because of my blog post yesterday on the lack of women in tech jobs. That would be perfect. If so, you made your point. Nicely done.

Yes, it cost me money.

If it was someone else, what is your point?
