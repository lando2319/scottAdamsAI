A reader sent me this note today:

“The day after you published this strip http://www.dilbert.com/2011-03-29/the UK free newspaper Metro published this.” http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/859451-ipods-could-be-powered-by-your-heartbeat

And another pointed to this http://io9.com/#!5784956/an-artificial-leaf-and-a-gallon-of-water-could-generate-enough-energy-to-power-your-house-for-a-day.

And more intersection of comics and life today: I coined the word frienditute in this /strips/comic/2010-12-01/comic in December. Now a website http://cloudgirlfriend.com/is poised to monetize the concept.
