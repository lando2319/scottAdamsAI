I just saw this article on the Internet about an economic prediction I made ten years before the recent financial meltdown.

This got me wondering, in jest, if I am eligible to someday win the Nobel Prize for Economics. (Okay, technically it’s called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sveriges_Riksbank_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences_in_Memory_of_Alfred_Nobel.) The surprising answer is yes. One only needs to come up with an original and useful contribution in the field of economics. You don’t need to do any math.

With that in mind, do you think the confusopoly theory is the simplest explanation of how the recent financial meltdown came to be? Obviously greed and stupidity were also factors, but those influences are well understood and common to all of economics.
