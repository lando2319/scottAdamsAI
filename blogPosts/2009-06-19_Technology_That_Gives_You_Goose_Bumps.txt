This might be a shocker, but I’m a bit of a nerd. I get the same sort of visceral thrill from a cool new technology that a wine lover gets from a great wine, or an artist gets from seeing great art. This morning I saw some technology that literally made me shiver. I’m talking actual goose bumps.

A young company called Neurosky. (www.neurosky.com http://www.neurosky.com/) is marketing a headset that reads your brainwaves. Understandably, toy and game companies are scrambling to make games that you can control just by the way you are thinking about things. The first toy out of the chute is a Jedi mind game in which you can cause a ping pong ball to rise just by concentrating. You might be thinking the same thing I am: Must…have…ping…pong…ball…mind…game…

But that’s not the shivery part. Watch the Washington Post’s Video about this technology. The link is on the Neurosky home page. It makes you feel as if you’re seeing a glimpse of the future. You have to wonder how far this line of technology can go.

I don’t know about you, but I rarely go a minute without wishing I could buy some sort of technology that would make it unnecessary for me to move my arms and legs. Imagine, instead of hunting all over your living room for the TV remote control, you could just sit on the couch visualizing it, and it would crawl out from its hiding place between the cushions and get on your lap. Then it would determine what mood you were in and find the TV show that best suits you. That might be a way off, but a man can dream.

Maybe you have a better idea for an application.
