Several years ago I wrote a non-Dilbert book called God’s Debris. I called it a “thought experiment” because I used hypnosis techniques in the writing to give readers a euphoric mental sensation, as if they were learning some deeper truth about reality. Evidently it worked. Many people tell me they have reread God’s Debris four or five times just for the buzz.

For others, God’s Debris is like eating an onion. People who are on the outer fringes of either dogmatism or skepticism find it hard to relax and simple feel ideas that don’t seem right to them. And if you have a doctorate in philosophy, or the like, you might not get the full impact of the book, in the same way that a guy taking an LSD trip doesn’t need a bong hit. But if you don’t fall into one of those categories, God’s Debris can be an interesting experience.

Until now, there was always one thing holding back the full impact of God’s Debris: The physical process of reading makes it difficult to fully relax at the same time. That’s why I’m excited that God’s Debris is finally available as an audio book, both on iTunes and Audible.com. Now you can slip in your ear buds, sit back, close your eyes, and take a 2-hour and 44 minute mental flight.

After an extensive search of voice talent, I chose DC Goode to narrate. In case you wondered, hypnosis requires no special type of voice. I chose DC because he made the material come alive. It’s a rare talent.

If you recommend the audiobook to anyone, let me know how they experienced it. You can e-mail me at dilbertcartoonist@gmail.com.
