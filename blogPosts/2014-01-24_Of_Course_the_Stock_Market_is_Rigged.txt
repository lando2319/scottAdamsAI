As I watch the stock markets melt down this week, I think back to my earlier post in which I made the case that manipulation in any field will always occur when you have these conditions:

1. Huge potential profit
2. Small chance of getting caught
3. Easy to do 

I’ll add a fourth element today: Lots of participants. That’s important because a million ants are more likely to find a way into your kitchen than three ants.

Today I saw some links to a highly analogous situation: Social media.

The bottom line is that companies and famous people are manipulating social media by buying fake followers. Why?

1. Huge potential profit
2. Small chance of getting caught (or at least small chance of meaningful penalty)
3. It is ridiculously easy
4. Lots of people on the Internet (some ants find the kitchen) 

Below are the links to the articles. Can you read this stuff and still believe that the recent moves in the stock market (and the inevitable 20% pullback yet to come for no particular reason) are not manipulation?
