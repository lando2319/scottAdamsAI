I have a common name. There are at least three guys named Scott Adams in my local community. Most big corporations have a Scott Adams on the payroll. We’re all over the place.

When your name is that common, it’s only a matter of time before one of us gets arrested for serial murder, running a Ponzi scheme, or having a dungeon below the house. So far we have been lucky. Most people named Scott Adams end up pursuing hyper-nerdish lines of business. The most famous Scott Adams who isn’t me is a pioneer computer game developer. Not too shabby. And recently a junior member of our club won a science award for genetically modifying wheat. Nice.

I wonder if other people throughout history have worried about this sort of thing. For example, one of the most colorful bad guys of all time was called Vlad the Impaler. You could Google him, but his name pretty much says it all. I wonder if after he got famous for being all fierce he worried that some other Vlad the Impaler would come along and ruin his reputation. He wouldn’t want to be walking the dog and overhear neighbors talking…

Neighbor one: Who gutted that peasant over by the other dead peasant?

Neighbor two: I heard it was Vlad the Impaler.

Neighbor one: Do you mean the chicken fornicator or the other one?

Right now there’s a 16-year old Scott Adams in Canada saying, “Why did that idiot have to write a blog about Vlad the Impaler and ruin my good name???”

Sorry.
