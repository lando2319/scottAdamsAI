I’ve written a few times that Clinton deserves credit for breaking the glass ceiling for the highest office, at least in our minds, and that’s where it matters most. In 2016, no thinking person believes gender is a job requirement for president. That isn’t even a thing anymore. And Clinton did that for the country. You have to respect that.

However, it is also true that Clinton tarnished women’s “brand” during the course of the election, with an assist from her opponents. You can respect much of what Clinton accomplished, but in the end she was an imperfect role model at best.

Meanwhile, over at the Trump campaign, we watched the best hirer-firer of our time replace Lewandowski with Manafort before replacing Manafort with Conway. Each campaign manager was right for a respective phase of the campaign. Lewandowski was the street-fighter that got Trump attention during a crowded primary. Manafort was the well-connected operator who could guide him through the Republican convention and the nomination.

But Conway took it home, against heavy odds. Her work was – as we can clearly see – insanely good.

Trump succeeded in large part because of three brilliant, super-tough, ultra-effective women: KellyAnne Conway https://www.google.com/search?q=kellyann&oq=kellyann&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61j69i60.2671j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=kellyanne+conway, Katrina Pierson https://www.google.com/search?q=Katrina+Pierson&oq=Katrina+Pierson&aqs=chrome..69i57.478j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8, and Ivanka Trump https://www.google.com/search?q=ivanka&oq=ivanka&aqs=chrome..69i57.1047j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8. 

If you cried on election day because it was a bad day for women, perhaps you were looking in the wrong direction.
