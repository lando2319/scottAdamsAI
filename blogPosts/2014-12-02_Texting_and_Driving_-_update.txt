Here’s a short video  http://news.yahoo.com/katie-couric-interviews-katasi-ceo-about-texting-and-driving-195250260.htmlof Katie Curic interviewing an entrepreneur with a device like the one I described a few posts ago to prevent teens from driving and texting.

The difference, I think, is that in my concept I required one driver to register as the designated driver in order for the car to start.
I can’t tell if there is an easy way for teens to defeat the product in the video. But if the teen only has one car, and the device is in it, I can see it working well so long as it also notifies a parent whenever the device is removed from the port.
