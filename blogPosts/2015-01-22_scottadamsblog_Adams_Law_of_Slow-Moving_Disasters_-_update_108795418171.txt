Regular readers know about my law of slow-moving disasters. The idea is that society always avoids global disasters that are slow-moving because we rise to the challenge even when it seems impossible.

Peak oil didn’t happen

Y2K was a big nothing

Malthus was wrong that we would run out of food

And so on…

One of our slow-moving disaster situations is the growing resistance to antibiotics. That’s a situation that looked like it could kick humanity’s ass. But science has once again risen to the challenge, or so it seems. See this story http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-30657486 about new breakthroughs.
