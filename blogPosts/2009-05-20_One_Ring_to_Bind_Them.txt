Over spring break we went to Florida for some family fun. The hotel was right on the beach. Most days we divided our time between the ocean and the hotel’s two huge swimming pools. Toward the end of one day, the four of us, plus a stranger or two, were relaxing in the oversized hot tub in the pool area. A 5-year old kid, I’m guessing, wearing swim goggles, came to the hot tub, took a breath, and submerged. He stayed under for awhile then surfaced with treasure: a man’s wedding ring and 75 cents in change.

The kid proudly showed off his find to his sister at the edge of the hot tub. I could tell from their reactions that this wasn’t their first time. I’m guessing that every hour or so, he would go diving for loose change in the hot tub. Apparently it was profitable.

Then I noticed my wedding ring was missing. The kid was still displaying his treasure to his sister. Deciding that possession was nine-tenths of the law, I snatched it out of his hand like a seagull on a cracker. I figured it would be easier to argue it was mine once it was actually on my finger. Luckily the kid didn’t put up a fight. Obviously he was new to this whole treasure hunting gig. Next time he’ll know to bring a spear gun.

In the nearly three years I have owned my wedding ring, it has never once fallen off my finger. And it happened on a day I was in the ocean, a huge swimming pool, and then a hot tub. It was also the one time I have ever seen a kid go treasure hunting in a hot tub. These two unlikely events conspired to return my ring to me. Or maybe it was some other guy’s ring. The point is that it fit. Whatever.
