You’ve probably seen Donald Trump’s recent quote about Mexican immigration. He said, “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some I assume are good people." 

People with good reading comprehension can see that he put no percentages on how many Mexican immigrants are criminals and how many are “good people.” He notes it is a mix, with the clear implication that the ratio of bad people is unacceptably high.

What does the data say? Beats me.

But if, for example, 20% of Mexican immigrants are bringing crime to the United States, is that enough to be worried about? I’m guessing 20% of Americans in our lower income groups are involved with drugs and other forms of crime, so that sounds like a reasonable range to guess for Mexicans coming to this country illegally. Is 20% too much? How about 10%? It seems subjective to me. But it isn’t an absurd issue to worry about.

Now check out this typical headline from Business Insider that cleverly converts Trumps quote into “NBC fires Donald Trump after he calls Mexicans rapists and drug runners.”

Writers don’t usually pick their own headlines, so don’t blame the writer in this case. Just note that Trump’s comment about some Mexican immigrants being criminals has been morphed by outragists into “Trump says Mexicans are rapists and drug runners.” That implies all Mexicans, even the ones that stay home, are up to no good. Very different from what Trump actually said.

I’m not a Trump supporter. I’m just anti-outragism.

In the run-up to the presidential election, the media is spring-loaded for candidate “gaffes” that they can take out of context to manufacture news. I’ll point them out as we go.




Update: Same writer, new article. Note the use of the “douche bag” photo that often accompanies stories like this one. The photo director should get a writing credit for this one. It changes the story.
