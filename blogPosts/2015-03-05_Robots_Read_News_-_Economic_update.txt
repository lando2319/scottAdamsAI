Other Interesting Things Today…

I predict that healthcare expenses will someday drop to 25% of their current level thanks to advances in medical devices. (I sometimes see the new stuff in beta when they pitch for funding, and WOW.) For example, check out a new digital stethoscope http://scottadams-startupreview.tumblr.com/post/112544269360/stethoscope-gets-smart that promises to make a big difference.

Next, Is passion a key to success, or just another benefit of getting there? I know I get plenty excited when things work out for me. Vivian Giang helps us sort that out. http://scottadams-viviangiang.tumblr.com/post/111394988403/what-comes-first-passion-or-money

Next, would you order take-out food more often if you could watch the delivery guy’s progress on your app, like Uber? I know I would. The comfort of knowing exactly when your food is coming is a psychological game-changer.

3D printing is getting scary. Now you can print at the molecule level and create mechanical sensors with no moving parts. http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/112745537361/top-tech-8-prevent-blood-loss-death-dont-sleep I wonder if 3D printing will be the only way people acquire household goods in the future.
