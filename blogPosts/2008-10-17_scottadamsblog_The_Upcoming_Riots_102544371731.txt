I plan to start hoarding supplies soon. There should be some big riots after the election. Here’s a sequence of events and conditions that would lead to rioting. Do you see anything on the list that isn’t likely?

 1. The economy stays bad for a another month
 2. Obama has a clear lead in the polls before election day
 3. McCain wins anyway. While the real reason for the polling discrepancy will be racism, there will be a widespread belief that the election was rigged. And there will be plenty of real and imagined evidence that it was.
 4. Riots will break out, partly out of genuine anger, partly to get that new flat screen TV.

We know the country can get past one suspicious Presidential election, because it did exactly that with Gore versus Bush. But two in a row would turn even normal citizens into conspiracy theorists. Given the anxiety over the economy, concerns about abortion rights, and the continuing wars, you have a perfect storm for revolution.

Interestingly, the only person who could stop the riots would be Obama himself.
