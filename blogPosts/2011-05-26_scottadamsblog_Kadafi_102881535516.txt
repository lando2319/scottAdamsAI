Check out my blog post from 2008 in which I talk about a way to give dictators a retirement path http://www.dilbert.com/blog/entry/retired_dictator_program/. Then check out this article from the Los Angeles Times in which a similar idea http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-libya-kadafi-figurehead-20110526,0,669130.storyis being floated for Kadafi. Iâ€™m not suggesting that Libya is reading my blog. But the similarity is interesting.
