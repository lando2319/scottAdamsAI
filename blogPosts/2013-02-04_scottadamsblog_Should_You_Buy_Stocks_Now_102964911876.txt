The Wall Street Journal unwisely offered to print my opinion on whether or not this is a good time to buy stocks. You can read my opinion here http://stream.wsj.com/story/experts-wealth-management/SS-2-135511/SS-2-160878/?mod=wsj_streaming_experts-wealth-management. You might need to scroll down.

In the coming weeks and months I will be weighing in on other important questions in the Wall Street Journal’s new feature called The Experts. I have often cautioned readers of this blog to ignore advice from cartoonists on any matters financial, medical, or legal. But that was before the Wall Street Journal labelled me an expert. Now I’m fairly certain everything I say is right. You should totally follow my advice for the rest of your life, which should last about a week before something I suggest kills you.
