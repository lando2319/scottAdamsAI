In Gmail, this icon means “return” to prior page.

A few inches away, on the same page, this icon means “reply.”

I’m curious if anyone on the Gmail design team noticed that these two icons are not what I like to call “different.”

I wonder if the team knows I have clicked the wrong one of those two icons approximately 7,285,942 times. And that’s just this week.

Is it just me?
