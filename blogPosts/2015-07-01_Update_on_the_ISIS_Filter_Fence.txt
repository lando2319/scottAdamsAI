Last August I described in this blog an idea  http://blog.dilbert.com/post/103051152716/isis-strategiesfor creating a safe zone for civilians that want to escape ISIS-held territory. You can see that here http://blog.dilbert.com/post/103051152716/isis-strategies. The idea is based on a novel I wrote years ago, the sequel to God’s Debris http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Debris-Experiment-Scott-Adams-ebook/dp/B00HFYD8E4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=, called The Religion War http://www.amazon.com/The-Religion-War-Scott-Adams-ebook/dp/B00HFYD8DK/ref=pd_sim_351_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0272K87MFEVV6QD3F6HG.

The idea is that a friendly country would create a well-defended safe zone that could be used over time to drain the civilians from ISIS territory. Once you have as many innocents out of the Caliphate as you reasonably can, which could take years, you seal the borders, cut off communication, and let nature do the rest.

There are all kinds of problems with that plan, but compared to the terrible alternatives, I think it has to be considered as an option. And now it looks like something akin to that plan is under motion http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-turkey-would-invade-northern-syria-2015-7. Turkey is likely to carve out a safe zone near its borders to block ISIS supply lines, create a buffer zone, and…create a haven for refugees.

No one would call it a Filter Fence because the primary objectives are cutting ISIS supply routes and defending Turkey’s borders. But the result will be a Filter Fence with a safe zone to drain civilians out of the area. 

Saudi Arabia is already building a “bad ass” wall http://www.ijreview.com/2015/01/233628-saudi-arabia-anti-isis-wall/ to keep ISIS out. Turkey’s future safe zone will be the second wall. If Iran figures out a way to seal their border tight (and obviously they are working on it) you have a pretty good Filter Fence in place. Here I’m assuming Israel and Jordan have their borders under control as well. Here’s a refresher map https://www.google.com/maps/place/Middle+East/@27.0821,44.0150558,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x157ec4658142ffb7:0xa5b8320215ea72c of the region.

You hated the Filter Fence idea when I first raised it. But it looks like things are evolving in that direction. In The Religion War, the trigger for sealing the Caliphate involves terrorist drone attacks around the world. That seems inevitable.

Am I the only one who sees the Filter Fence around ISIS as 100% likely? (Barring a meteor striking Earth, or something else that big.)

In Top Tech Blog http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/122903540286/top-tech-88-quantum-barriers-3d-hearts-super, thank goodness someone finally figured out how to run an annealing algorithm to find the lowest points, corresponding to optimal or near optimal solutions, in a virtual “energy landscape.” Also, blah, blah, something quantum computing. http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/122903540286/top-tech-88-quantum-barriers-3d-hearts-super

And now you can 3D-print a human heart http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/122903540286/top-tech-88-quantum-barriers-3d-hearts-super. I think that is the perfect gift for a romantic partner. (This is just a small sample of why I am not married.)

Apparently it is Samsung’s turn to say it is inventing an awesome battery technology http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/122903540286/top-tech-88-quantum-barriers-3d-hearts-super that won’t be ready for market soon. Next!
