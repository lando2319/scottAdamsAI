We are making updates to the Dilbert blog (moving to the WordPress platform) that will result in an error message for many (example here http://afdsdtse.tumblr.com/).


To minimize those affected, the site will be down starting Tuesday the 25th around midnight ET and be back online early the following morning.


The blog will still be accessible to Tumblr followers.


Those accessing the blog from Dilbert.com will see an interruption in service, but you can access the blog by going to scottadamsblog.tumblr.com http://scottadamsblog.tumblr.com/
