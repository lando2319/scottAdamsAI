Today Asok the intern came out. Tomorrow he’ll have some things to say about the so-called government of India.

Cue the inevitable cries of “Stop being political! You’re ruining Dilbert!”

Allow me to address that right now.

It’s only political if there’s someone on the other side of the debate. In this case, no one favors a government deciding which sexual acts among consenting adults in the privacy of their own homes are allowed and which are punishable by jail.

If I am wrong, and you favor the government restricting what kind of sex you can have with another consenting adult, please proudly state your case. I’m listening.

Cue cricket sounds…
