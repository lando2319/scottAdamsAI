True story from five minutes ago.

Someone tweeted me an article showing photos of droughts and other natural disasters with the caption “Photos don’t lie.” I tweeted in response to the article, “On what planet do photos not lie?”

Sixty seconds later I see this photoshopped photo in my feed.

(I knew right away that it was fake because I don’t own a suit.)
