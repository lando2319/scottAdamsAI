Half of my blog readers today are originating from a source that Google Analytics can’t (or won’t) identify within the United States, which is odd. Most of the traffic is coming to see my post http://blog.dilbert.com/post/127310496506/the-day-you-became-a-better-writer-2nd-look on how to be a better writer. (So the traffic isn’t about politics or anything politically incorrect.)

I can see traffic coming from Twitter, Reddit, and the usual suspects. But something else is brewing that Google can’t see. Can you fill me in?
