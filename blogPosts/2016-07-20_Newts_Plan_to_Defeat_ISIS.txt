Newt Gingrich has a plan http://freebeacon.com/politics/newt-gingrich-strategy-destroy-isis/ to defeat ISIS by destroying the technology in ISIS-held territory. I described a similar approach in this post http://blog.dilbert.com/post/131952466891/how-a-hypnotist-would-solve-isis.

The interesting part of this approach is that it frames the enemy as something from the past. This is more about persuasion than death. All we’d be doing is destroying the technology (and anyone standing near it) that did not originate within Islam. That seems fair to me.

Read Newt’s idea and mine. Some version of this kind of thinking is the answer.

If you think Newt’s idea is similar in some ways to mine, you should read my book. Everything in that book http://amzn.to/1oTGu8x is similar to the way I write.
