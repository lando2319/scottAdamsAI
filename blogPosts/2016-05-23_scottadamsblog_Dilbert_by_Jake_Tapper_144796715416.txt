If you’re wondering why Dilbert looks different today, it’s because I asked CNN anchor and host Jake Tapper http://www.cnn.com/profiles/jake-tapper-profile to be my guest artist for the week of 5/23/16. I wrote six daily comics for the week and Jake did the art. You can see them on the home page http://dilbert.com starting with the first one today.

Jake suggested auctioning the framed original art on eBay to raise money for Homes for our Troops https://www.hfotusa.org/, and that sounded great to me. HFOT is an organization that builds mortgage-free, specially designed homes for disabled veterans. You can bid for the originals on eBay here http://www.ebay.com/usr/hfot_homesforourtroops. Please do. It’s a great cause.

I hope you like the change-of-pace this week. My only complaint is that Jake’s a better artist than me. Do me a favor and don’t notice that part.
