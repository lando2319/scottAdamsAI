This is just for fun. I’m not psychic.

But as coincidences go, this one is a bit freaky.

In my 2004 novel, The Religion War http://www.amazon.com/Religion-War-Scott-Adams/dp/0740747886/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr= (sequel to God’s Debris http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Debris-Experiment-Scott-Adams-ebook/dp/B00HFYD8E4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) I imagined an American leader named Cruz – a man of God – taking a war of extermination to the Caliphate. Here’s an excerpt.

The book was written as a prediction about a coming caliphate and their use of hobby-sized drones to attack cities. 

Here’s Ted Cruz’ actual position about exterminating ISIS http://www.businessinsider.com/ted-cruz-carpet-bomb-strategy-isis-war-macfarland-2016-2.

Am I spooky yet?
