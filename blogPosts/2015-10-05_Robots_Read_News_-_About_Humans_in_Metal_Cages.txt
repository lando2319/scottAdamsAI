On an unrelated topic…

When I wrote God’s Debris http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Debris-A-Thought-Experiment-ebook/dp/B00HFYD8E4/ref=pd_sim_351_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0SVACQ8E6EMT7PVW157X&dpID=51Wblz6LPAL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR116%2C160_ in 2001, I thought it would be a decade or more before it caught on. The zeitgeist wasn’t ready, but it was heading in that direction. So I engineered the book to have a time-release trigger. (That was literally my plan.) Looks like we’re on schedule. It is number one in its sub-category.

And what triggered the time release?

Donald Trump.

I did not predict Trump specifically, but I did expect society to start realizing that humans do not use reason to make decisions. (That’s the lesson I learned in hypnosis class in my twenties.) Trump is demonstrating – via his powers of persuasion – that free will is an illusion, at least for some voters, and the impact of that realization will change the world in subtle but important ways. Once you let go of your certainty about your view of reality, God’s Debris is a fun read. Or so I hoped when I wrote it.

The sequel, The Religion War http://www.amazon.com/The-Religion-War-Scott-Adams-ebook/dp/B00HFYD8DK/ref=pd_sim_351_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=04Z53D7FBZ7KEHEEMB8Y&dpID=51wYmi5TFOL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR115%2C160_, published in 2004, also has a time-release trigger. I designed the trigger to activate when three specific things happened in the world: 

A caliphate forms in the Middle East. (check)




There is talk of walling off the caliphate. (check) 




Terrorists use hobby-sized drones for attacks on U.S. soil. (soon)

In the book, a conservative leader named Cruz rises to power in the United States and gains control of the military. That part seems unlikely. Right?

That’s what makes it fiction.
