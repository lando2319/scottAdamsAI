Most of you follow the news. I’m interested in how you interpreted a recent story. President Obama made some comments about Israel’s borders. Which of the following best represents what the President said?

1.  Israel should return to the 1967 borders, or something close to it. (Israel considers this border solution militarily indefensible.)

Or

2.  Israel and the Palestinians should start negotiating based on the 1967 boundaries and make land swaps until both sides get what they need for a lasting peace.

Obviously both sides want a number of other conditions to be satisfied too. But for this discussion, let me know how you interpreted President Obama’s view of the border negotiation issue.
