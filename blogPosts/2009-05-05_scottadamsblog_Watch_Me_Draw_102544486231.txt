Here’s a link to a recent article about me. I thought it was especially well written.

As regular readers know, I lost my voice for several years thanks to a vocal condition called spasmodic dysphonia. I regained my ability to speak thanks to the one surgeon in the world who pioneered a fix for this problem.

I sound terrible on the video because I was drawing and talking at the same time, so you hear me mumbling and searching for the right words. I don’t multitask well. So unfortunately that’s my “normal” voice. The spasmodic dysphonia problem is 100% gone. When I’m not distracted, my voice is better now than it ever was, largely because I did so much vocal training before discovering the surgery. I actually came out ahead on this deal.

If you have read anything about my use of affirmations, you might be interested to know that the only affirmation I’ve employed for the past several years has been “I Scott will speak perfectly.” This was a worthy test of affirmations since most voice experts said spasmodic dysphonia was incurable. I’d guess that 99% of the people with the same condition believe it can’t be fixed, and that belief will make it true for them. I chose to believe the opposite. So while I still don’t speak “perfectly,” I’m already better than my old “normal” voice.
