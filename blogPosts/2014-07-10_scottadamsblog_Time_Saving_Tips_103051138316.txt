This isn’t a blog post.


I’m compiling time-saving tips for daily life, which I will post here or elsewhere (with a link from here). Do you have any to add?


So far I have found some apps that save time doing routine tasks. Let me know if I missed anything.


Ifttt (If This Then That) - Automate tasks across your apps

Keyring – Put all loyalty cards on your phone

CalendarTree - Add entire schedules to your existing calendar with a few clicks

Remember the Milk - To do list

Fastcustomer app – Calls you back when customer service is on phone

Camcard – Scans business cards

Easilydo – task automation

World Time Buddy app - Know what time it is someplace else
