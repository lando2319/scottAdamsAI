You probably saw the news on Top Tech Blog  http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/127032500506/top-tech-118-track-activity-monitor-glucoseabout the proposed space tower http://www.techinsider.io/thoth-12-mile-space-tower-elevator-astronauts-travel-major-flaws-2015-8 to launch spaceships from its roof.

You will not be surprised to hear that skeptics believe it can never be stable against the elements. And its own weight would crush it.

So…what kind of tall shape would be more stable than a skinny tower? How about a mostly-empty pyramid (more like a skeleton of a pyramid) with a solid tube core for wind energy production (from the updraft)?

See my old blog post on pyramid-shaped space towers http://blog.dilbert.com/post/103051117616/pyramids-save-the-world here. I didn’t think about launching anything from the top. I’ll add that :-)
