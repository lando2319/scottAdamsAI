Is it more dangerous for a humorist to insult Mohammed or to discuss Bill Cosby?

I suppose it depends whether you are in France or the United States.

See this [NSFW] Playboy interview of Patton Oswalt http://www.playboy.com/articles/the-playboy-conversation-patton-oswalt-wil-wheaton. Search for “context” or “Salon” to get to the good part. He has the same problem I have with the bottom-feeding part of the media. I don’t think people realize how big a deal this is.
