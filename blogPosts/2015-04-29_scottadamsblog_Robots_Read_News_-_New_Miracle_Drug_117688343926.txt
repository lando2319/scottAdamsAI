Here come 3D holograms that float in the air http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/117654047466/top-tech-47-graphene-holograms-infrared-bionic without special glasses. I plan to leave a hologram behind when I die, like Obi Wan Kenobi, just to freak people out. Or perhaps I will port my personality to software and have the computer generate my 3D hologram when needed. Good luck getting rid of me!!! BUWHAHAHAHA!

How about a smart bullet http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/117654047466/top-tech-47-graphene-holograms-infrared-bionic that changes direction in flight to chase a target? Can I shoot down my neighbor’s drone with that bullet? And more importantly, will my hologram ever be able to shoot that gun?

And how about bionic eyes for blind folks? Here they come. http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/117654047466/top-tech-47-graphene-holograms-infrared-bionic
