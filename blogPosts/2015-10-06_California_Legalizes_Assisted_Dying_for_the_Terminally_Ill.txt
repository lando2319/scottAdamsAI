Regular readers of this blog know I have some history with the topic of doctor-assisted dying.

My father died in 2013. That experience left my emotions raw, and prompted me to write this blog post http://blog.dilbert.com/post/102964994651/i-hope-my-father-dies-soon.* It went viral.

At the time, a Gallup poll said 51% of Americans favored doctor-assisted dying. That seemed low to me. Indeed, when the question was asked in a more positive way, Gallup showed support in the high sixties.

A year later, according to Gallup, support for doctor-assisted dying law in America had jumped from 51% to 58%. Using positive phrasing for the same poll question, support was as high as 69%.

On October 5th, 2015, Governor Brown signed a bill http://ktla.com/2015/10/05/gov-brown-signs-medical-aid-in-dying-bill-legalizing-assisted-suicide-in-california/ legalizing doctor-assisted dying.


Polls http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/09/03/igs-poll-californians-support-medical-aid-in-dying-for-terminally-ill/ say 76% of Californians are in favor of having the option.


I support the new law. But under the circumstances, celebration of its passing seems inappropriate.

Instead I would like to show some appreciation to the folks who opposed the law for reasons of human dignity, or because of risk to the differently abled. And special thanks to Jimmy Akin http://jimmyakin.com/ for artfully explaining his views http://blog.dilbert.com/post/118799040916/death-with-dignity-verdict for my blog readers. While I support the new law in California, I keep in mind that others are fighting for the value of human life, and fair treatment to all. I think the world is a better place for your voices, and they form the right kind of balance. I wouldn’t want to live on a planet where questions of life and death are treated casually. So thank you, sincerely, for that.
