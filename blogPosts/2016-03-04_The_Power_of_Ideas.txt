Google “Republican Debate https://www.google.com/search?q=Republican+debate&oq=republ&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i65j69i60l2j69i59.1327j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8#q=Republican+debate&start=10” and see where this blog shows up in the rankings. It’s on the second page, between Forbes and CBS news. I noticed because Google Analytics showed people coming to this site based on that search term.

The ranking might change by the time you read this, but it it shows you the power of social media. 

And thank you for all the attention. I wouldn’t blog if I couldn’t see your comments. You energize me, I write. Then you strangle the bad ideas so the good ones can rise.

Collectively, we put a nice ripple on the universe.

Kind of amazing.

Thank you for this experience.
