One of my favorite words is “doomed.” It always makes me laugh. I like the way it sounds. And I reflexively find humor in situations that are so bad there is no hope. I’m not proud of this quality. I’m just saying that if scientists discover a giant asteroid heading toward Earth, I would probably laugh myself to death before the impact.


With that in mind, today I saw two articles about human intelligence, as it relates to voting. I suggest you read both, and pause after each paragraph to contemplate the word “doomed.” It might make the experience funnier.

Here’s the first. This one made me laugh my “ars” off.

This one is almost as funny.

Now go out there and vote. Especially if you are sure you are right!
