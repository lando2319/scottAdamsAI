OVER AT TOP TECH BLOG:

A gyroscope smaller than a human hair http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/116344505241/top-tech-36-quantum-computers-camera-eye-exams moves humankind one step closer to spreading our DNA to far-off words on millions of tiny, inexpensive rockets launched at the end of Earth’s run. But I might be reading too much into it.

If you think self-driving cars are scary, wait until your doctor is software. Every new medical device seems to move us in that direction. Here’s a new one for eye exams. http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/116344505241/top-tech-36-quantum-computers-camera-eye-exams

In other news, a researcher says http://%E2%80%9CA%20highly%20coherent%20qubit,%20like%20the%20spin%20of%20a%20single%20phosphorus%20atom%20in%20isotopically%20enriched%20silicon,%20can%20be%20controlled%20using%20electric%20fields,%20instead%20of%20using%20pulses%20of%20oscillating%20magnetic%20fields,%E2%80%9D,  “A highly coherent qubit, like the spin of a single phosphorus atom in isotopically enriched silicon, can be controlled using electric fields, instead of using pulses of oscillating magnetic fields.” And thank God for that, I say.




That is all for today.
