WHO THOUGHT THEY COULD BEAT A BRANDING WIZARD IN A POLITICAL RACE? 


ASK SWEATY https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/09/17/so-much-sweat-why-it-was-hard-for-the-candidates-to-look-cool-during-the-gop-debate/, PLENTY http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-hits-rand-paul-gop-debate-article-1.2363485, NICE http://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2015/09/04/dr-nice-guy-ben-carsons-gentle-charm-offensive, ROBOT http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/18/donald-trump-compares-carly-fiorina-to-a-robot/, OR LOW-ENERGY http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/donald-trump-keeps-pounding-low-energy-jeb-bush/2243180.

To be fair, Trump’s opponents have also branded him… as a person who speaks his mind and doesn’t pretend to know more than he does.

Let’s call that roughly equal.

By the way, labeling Rubio “sweaty” is a brilliant debate tactics for next time. If you are a person who perspires heavily on stage, the one thing you do NOT want to do is think about it on stage. Makes it far worse. Expect Rubio to be a flop-sweat mess at the next debate.

And my favorite Jedi mind trick that Trump used in the first debate was directed toward Rand Paul. Trump said, “You’re having a hard time tonight.” That is weapons-grade mindf*cking.

I haven’t mentioned Walker, but only because voters probably don’t know that he and Rubio are different people. As I watched the second debate, I imagined the viewing public wondering why Rubio sometimes looked handsome and sometimes goofy. They probably thought it was a lighting problem.
