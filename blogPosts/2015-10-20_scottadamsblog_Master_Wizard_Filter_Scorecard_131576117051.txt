Pundits declared that Carly Fiornia won the most recent Republican debate. Her poll numbers surged, as you might expect.

Meanwhile, I was applying the Master Wizard Filter to the debate and predicting that Fiorina had self-destructed that night by pairing her brand with the image of a dead baby. INTENTIONALLY! In a blog post http://blog.dilbert.com/post/129289732811/carly-fiorina-and-the-wizard-filter, I called that mistake self-immolation.

A new CNN poll http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/20/politics/poll-donald-trump-ben-carson-gop/ says Fiorina’s poll numbers fell off a shelf. We don’t know all the reasons why, but the data conforms to prediction.

In other news, Trump released a funny edit of Bill Clinton’s interview with Colbert that makes Clinton seem to endorse Trump. If you recall, I made a similar observation here http://blog.dilbert.com/post/131021852431/who-will-bill-clinton-vote-for.
