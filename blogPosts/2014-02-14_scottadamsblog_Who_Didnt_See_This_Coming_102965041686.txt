The other day I drew a comic featuring Dogbert creating a transactions network for criminals so he could steal their Bitcoins.



I can’t show you the third panel untl publication date, 4-2-14.

Call me jaded, but it seems to me that when you combine a network of criminals with a magical form of money, you’re asking for trouble. And sure enough, today we see this story http://read.bi/1nx2w9Y about Silk Road getting hacked. 


This is why I think the stock market is fixed. It’s because every time someone CAN steal your money without detection, it happens.
