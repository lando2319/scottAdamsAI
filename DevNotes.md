# Tumblr

Tumblr api pull said scottadamsblog has 1962 posts but we ran it and it only created 1961 files
not sure, maybe it was deleted, or maybe the code's wrong

Maybe it's looping and misses the next post because it has the same date

I confirmed the first and last posts are the same comparing to the acutal website

Not sure about the discrepency

Long term, I'd like to grab the missing one if we can
