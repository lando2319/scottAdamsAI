# Tumblr

Tumblr api pull said scottadamsblog has 1962 posts but we ran it and it only created 1955 files
not sure, maybe double naming of blog posts on the same day, or maybe they were deleted, or maybe the code's wrong

Maybe it's looping and misses the next post because it has the same date

I confirmed the first and last posts are the same comparing to the acutal website

Not sure about the discrepency

Long term, I'd like to grab those missing ones if we can
