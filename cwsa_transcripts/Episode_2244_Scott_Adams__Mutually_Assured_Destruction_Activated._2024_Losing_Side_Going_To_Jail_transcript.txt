do do
[Applause]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams
because of the coffee and because of me
and if you'd like to take this
experience to levels that could only be
described as Platinum
all you need is a cup of my girl glass
so take your jealous Diana can't team
geographlaska The Vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee enjoy me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen now go
um we've got a health tip somebody's
coming in with a health tip
John Smith says uh penis Health tip eat
garlic and apple cider vinegar and jerk
off with cocoa oil
okay you're probably not a doctor
but I was pretty excited about all that
good advice there until I got to the end
but that's why I do this show so that
you can get good
political and health advice like that
one
you know it's worth a try I'm I'm not
going to poo poo it without trying it
obviously I'll try it but
anyway
so there's a book I think it's called
the two parent privilege getting
everybody yakking the same way that they
Yak when Larry Elder says families are
the answer
and yeah the idea is
that people with two parents have all
the advantages and the kids have the
advantages and so it's good to have two
parents
but
what kind of
what kind of criticism could you ever
have about that
who could disagree
does anybody disagree that having two
parents is better than one
no here's the hard part
how do you go back
how do you go from where we are
to
there there's no path
so it's one of those uh unfortunately
there are a number of things on the
right that people want but they have no
way to get there so it doesn't matter
how much you want it you might as well
stop talking about it
so I looked on CNN to see a story about
this uh Jill phillipovic had an opinion
about this two-parent privilege problem
and notes that most people want to get
married
do you know why most people don't get
married even though they want to get
married
according to Jill
Philip Povich in CNN what is the reason
that people are not getting married
now remember at CNN it's CNN so CNN had
to be okay with the publication of the
opinion so that's your hint
what is the reason
that there's not as much marriage
climate change was an excellent guess I
think that's actually a part of it but
it's not not what's in this article
racism no no but that's always a good
guess racism was an excellent guess but
not what I'm looking for
now the answer is uh because men suck
yeah the reason that men and women are
getting married less and I think this is
obvious according to Jill
it's uh you know you've got half of the
half of the situation is women
and half as men you know not counting
the lgbtq situation on top of it but of
the men and the women Jill has narrowed
it down to the men
so the man
uh are worthless and they don't have
good jobs and they're not worth burying
so logically the women who are complete
and whole and wonderful in every way
well they're not going to pick them end
because the men used to be good but now
they're pieces of so you can't go
back
fake
all right
um
so that's that's the problem it's the
men
do you know who has a equally dumb
opinion as the problem is the men
conservatives
it is equally done to say that
everything's fine we should just get
together and pair off
and maybe if you tweak the tax code a
little bit then people want to get
married or maybe maybe you take away
some of the financial advantages
of being single and then people will
want to get married
that's going to work
does anybody think that we can just go
back to people wanting to be married
we're way past that
we're way past it we we might actually
you know because the pendulum always
swings so we might get to we might get
to a place where people want to be
married but it won't be because we
socially engineered it it won't be
because you tweaked the tax code that's
not going to make people get married
people people have changed
the problem is not marriage the problem
is people but it's not the men
is both
obviously we are no longer valuable to
each other
why does a woman need a man if she can
get a job
right why does a man need a woman if he
can date multiple people
yeah and and there are a lot of people
who say it's not worth it to have a kid
they might be wrong but it's a it's a
growing thought
so the problem here is that nobody has
anything that's even approximately
a system or a plan or a scheme or a
strategy to get us to where people want
to be married and that works out nobody
has any idea so every day that we spend
talking about ooh traditional marriage
is probably just a waste of time
and it's not because I don't think being
married would be better I think all the
statistics show that it's just you can't
take the people who are not marriage
material and then pair them off and
expect you to get a good good result
the people are married happily
are really special cases
they either got married really early or
there's something about the two of them
that's special or you know but usually
it's getting married early is a big part
of that
so I I think the whole marriage
situation we don't have the slightest
grasp not even the slightest grasp on
how you would change that
so I think here's what we need
I think we need two tracks
I think there needs to be a way to
thrive without being married which we
don't have
and there needs to be a way to thrive
when you are married which I would argue
we don't have
for most people
yeah it works great for some people but
for most people neither situation works
so how could you tweak both situations
so you can have you could have happy
single people maybe with kids and happy
married people with kids
and I feel like the the single people
with kids problem
is going to have to do something with
some kind of tribal Arrangements where
you know a dozen I'll just toss out an
idea it could be something like there's
an app that allows people to who are
single and maybe want to have children
or have children who want to match up
so that there's somebody there to watch
your kids
right if you're a single parent with two
kids your biggest problem is watching
the kids
if you were 12 single people
and you live you know walking distance
to each other then you would always have
somebody who's home there's always
somebody who could watch the kid there's
always somebody who could watch your dog
there's always somebody who could do an
errand because you're sick that day
something like that so you could
probably create Mutual assistant groups
that also have children involved that
would work maybe not as good as marriage
you know if you'd like to maintain that
marriage is the ultimate well I'll give
you that it's just that not everybody is
going to work in that situation
so just create an entirely different
model
for the single people that also works
because they're not just going to get
married so it's a wishful thinking
that they're just going to go get
married
there's a lot in politics which is just
wishful thinking with no structure or
idea plan strategy to get to that magic
place
all right sort of like abortion
conservatives would like people to just
stop doing it
it's not going to happen
so
you're gonna have to deal with the fact
that it's just not going to happen
but I think a lot of it is just wishful
thinking well what if it did happen but
it's not
but what if it did but it's not
it feels like a there's a lot of that
going on all right so I saw a
provocative comment here that I'm going
to blame on somebody else
but one of the good things about what I
do here is if I don't want to say
something under my own opinion I'll just
find somebody else who said it and quote
it to you look at this guy ah let's look
at this guy I wouldn't say this so
here's something I would never say I
would never say this but uh over on the
X platform doc energy doc Anarchy is
that it who by the way uh publishes
Renegade Health Magazine if you want
some Renegade health related stuff from
a doctor
uh check that out anyway doc Anarchy
said in the next post
uh I used to be a strong advocate for
talk therapy you know the kind where you
go to a therapist and you talk
and then he goes on the profession has
become overrun with college educated
women and effeminate man who act like
college-educated women
this is no longer a viable option for
most people you are the enemy the second
you walk through those doors
that was my exact experience
in my first marriage we tried some
marriage therapy
and I was pretty sure she treated me as
the enemy when I walked in the door
and everything that happened after that
felt like I was the enemy and I didn't
know where it came from
like I couldn't understand it and I
really couldn't understand it until this
moment until I read doc Anarchy's post
oh oh it's an industry of people who
have been trained that I'm the problem
and I imagined that I would get in that
walk in there and get something like
therapy no I walked in there and I got
blamed that's what happened I got blamed
completely
and the ground rules were that my wife
makes no problems and had no problems
and did everything right but we need to
work on me
and that's before we even talked about
what anything was it was just that was
like the basic idea when you walk in the
door
yeah no talk therapy is completely
broken
all right here's a little Trend to
frighten you you know how people wanted
to ban Tick Tock in the United States
I'm one of those but Tick Tock argued
hey Tick Tock is a subsidiary a bite
dance sure bite dance is a Chinese
company and we all know that the Chinese
government has complete control over
Chinese companies
but they argued no no we're running Tick
Tock as a separate entity either they
make their own decisions and they're not
part of the the Chinese machine even
though the parent company is
so that worked until recently the
reports are that uh there's a string of
high-level Executives from the parent
company
that have gone into the subsidiary and
taken the top jobs
so everything they said about these two
entities operating separately is
complete because the people
from the corporate jobs just took over
for the people in the subsidiary
that's all you need to know of course
China has complete control of tick tock
and of course they don't operate
autonomously that would be ridiculous
now what's interesting is that the story
was in the Wall Street Journal
that's owned by uh
the Murdoch's I guess it's the father or
son and I'm not sure who owns it now I
guess the sun is running it but the dad
still owns it
um so while one Murdoch property was
basically calling out Tick Tock uh Fox
News which is also owned by Murdoch is
now doing advertising for
Tick Tock so Tick Tock is a sponsor for
one of the Murdoch properties and the
other one is calling it out for its
connections to China
it's a weird world
if you're a billionaire you end up on
both sides of every issue because you
own something
that if that affects both sides The Wall
Street Journal just wants to tell the
news
just tell them the news and this is the
news
and Fox News these advertisers or their
model doesn't work so they're even
though they have the same ownership
they're sort of on different sides of
this in a way
I won't say sides but you know what I
mean there's an awkward situation
all right
um
so in my opinion
the bribery allegations about the Biden
family
at least the Chinese part are now so
well documented there's no question
about it that he was literally bribed
during his vice president years and
maybe on both sides and we now have the
money flows we know that it flowed to
the address Hunter used his father's
address we know that Biden talked to the
person who sent money we know that he
wrote a college recommendation for the
guy's son at the same time the money was
transferred we know that Biden was on
the phone threatening the guy give us
the money we basically have the whole
story
total complete
you know complete information there's no
doubt about it
now how in the world
do we have this situation and he's still
president
how in the world
now could it be that all of this
information is fake
do you think that you know Jesse Waters
reporting on it in great detail by the
way I think Jesse Waters
does the best job on all of the
complicated legal stories
have you noticed that
like if you watch Jesse Waters he'll
he'll give you the clearest cleanest
brief summary of what's going on and
these technical things until you listen
to him you go oh I get it now and
sometimes it's the first time I
understand the story is when he lays it
out in context he's really really good
at that and I would also say that Jesse
Waters is he's got the Joe Rogan
brilliance
and what I mean by that is that they
both pretend they're less smart than
they are
right so Joe Rogan's the every man but
it sort of hides the fact that he is
smarter than most of the people who
watch a show he's unusually smart and he
just it's a little less obvious because
he's you know man's man and he's got a
persona
Jesse Waters plays the uh the jester
sometimes mocking himself and his own
opinions and stuff but then when he
delivers he delivers the cleanest
analyzes that anybody's doing in the
news so it's quite impressive so shout
out to Jesse
but uh he's the one I would look to if
you're looking to understand the whole
China bribery thing rather than me try
to explain all the ins and outs of it
I'm just going to summarize it by saying
it's a fact
I don't think there's any question
whatsoever that China was or at least
one Chinese company was bribing the
bidens
uh and the Ukraine looks close to the
fact
I mean it seems completely obvious that
now that we know the whole Bob and
Menendez Story the person who took the
job that that Biden used to have you
know the foreign intelligence chair and
now we know that he was probably
allegedly taken bribes so it seems that
Everything 100 of everything we've
learned is confirming that Biden is
crooked and has been taking bribes for a
long time
and we just go on we wake up today like
nothing happened
nothing's going to happen on this am I
right
nothing unless
unless you've got a Republican president
and then I think he would go to jail
and
I also think that if Biden were to win
you know if he stayed alive long enough
to win I think you'll put Trump in jail
not directly
but he won't pardon him and he'll let
his Hench people who are the prosecutors
just put him in jail
so
mutually uh assured destruction has been
activated
we're in a situation where you could
pretty much predict that the losers go
into jail this time
the losers go into jail
that's where we are and not just the
loser
Trump has actually threatened that he
would investigate NBC and MSNBC
for crimes he thinks they should go to
jail too
and I agree
I agree but when I watch MSNBC
I feel like it's a crime being committed
because it doesn't look like they're
really even trying to predict to show
the news it looks like they're a
government operation
which I'm sure would be Trump's
accusation it looks like it's a uh
a wing of the government that's used to
clamp down on free speech and on
opposition
so should it be illegal I don't know I
don't know if any crime has been
committed if no crime has been committed
then of course I don't want anybody to
go to jail but to me the whole MSNBC
situation looks criminal it doesn't look
like a different opinion it just looks
criminal like it's a plot or a scheme to
affect power in the United States
regardless of the facts
now you can say if but Scott bus Scott
Fox News is just like that but I would
say Fox News is more like CNN
an obvious bias which they don't try to
hide
MSNBC is a completely different animal
they're they're not just biased there is
something different going on and I think
Trump's Instinct about that is right
there's something very crooked about
that situation I don't know exactly what
it is
so I think we're at a point where
um if you're going to threaten to put
Trump in jail it is perfectly
appropriate that he threatens it if he
wins everybody's going to jail like all
of his all of his enemies I think we're
at that point where I could support that
totally
I completely support it I wouldn't have
said this maybe even a month ago but
we've reached the point where it's
obvious they're going to take Trump down
for what looks like politically
motivated stuff if you're going to take
the leader probable probable leader of
one side of the country down for
you better get it done
because if he wins
he has all moral authority to take every
one of his enemies down and put him in
jail
because the January 6th thing showed
that you can jail people for political
reasons yeah you can make up a reason
you can always make up a crime
but the motivation is political
so yeah mutually assured destruction if
you are a
a leading Democrat you should be worried
actual jail responsibility now and I
would go deep I would cut deep I mean I
would I would indict just a ton of
people if I were the winning Republican
guy I'd take out
I know
you could make your own list but
do you think shift should be walking
free
Adam Schiff I think he should be in jail
for a lying to the country about what
was in the skiff
to me that seemed traitorous I don't
know is there any law that was broken
well if no law was broken then no you
should not go to jail but I'd look into
it
he was certainly trying to put another
person in jail
so I think the controls are off the
guardrails are off it's a it's winter
jail
win or jail that's our new situation and
I'm down for it
all right
um
what else is going on here
so you know the story about how the the
Russians maybe they didn't collude
exactly with Trump you know maybe it
wasn't exactly collusion
but that they interfered
so once it was shown that Trump you know
didn't collude then Hillary Clinton and
her Hench monkeys decided that uh well
but they interfered on his behalf that's
why it was a crooked election Russia
interfered and one of the biggest
interferences was that the Russians
allegedly hacked the DNC
and that caused some embarrassment and
you know maybe that might have been one
of the factors that changed the election
now when you first heard that our
government said they caught Russian
hackers hacking the DNC did you believe
it
did you believe that our our people
could first of all know who hacked and
second of all they would tell you and
that it's honest
there was no part of me that believed
that story from day one I never believed
that they could identify the hackers or
or if they did that they would tell us
the truth
and now there's some indication in
racket news I think Matt taibi has
something to do with that and some stack
I think it's a matter how you be thing
that uh the Georgia Tech team that led
the researchers into a different hoax
there was the alpha server story
I don't remember a lot about that but it
was some story that turned out to be
false it was just a hoax
um well it wasn't a hoax it was an
intentional fake story and some of the
people behind that intentional fake
story about the alpha servers and you
know some some bad financial behavior
between Trump and
some European entity but it wasn't true
however the same people who pushed that
so we know they're criminal are the ones
who are the first to say hey it looks
like Russia
it was Russia that hacked us the unsafe
now is it a coincidence that known Liars
or hoaxers
are the same ones behind the least
credible piece of information ever
you can you can discount any credibility
it might be true by the way but there's
no credibility to the story that the
Russians hacked the DNC they might have
done it I'm not saying they didn't do it
I'm saying there's no credible
information because you as the public
don't know where stuff comes from
you know the news might tell you hey
blah blah blah but you don't know where
that came from if it came from this set
of cats
it's
but we didn't know that until today it
took to today for me to find out that
the first people reported it and then it
became a thing that it was the Russians
act it there they had no credibility at
all none
so I don't think that the Russians
necessarily did it but we can tell
there's something sketchy about the
whole thing
all right
in a risen poll NBC poll 72 percent of
Voters say they're dissatisfied with the
Biden economy and Biden economics
bidenomics
72 percent
would a 72 percent
of people not happy about the economy
suggest that the incumbent is not going
to win
yes
yes
it suggests that the account the
incumbent Biden couldn't possibly win
re-election because it's the economy
stupid right
and the economy it was bad according to
72 percent of people it's where not
where it should be
so
under those conditions what would you do
what would you do if you were Biden and
you were so deep in a hole and the
person that you're going against is 10
points up in a recent poll
I don't know what you do oh let's let's
switch to the next story that has
nothing to do with this story
Trump's in deep legal trouble
so it looks like the state of New York
and Leticia James is uh pushing their
case that uh and I guess the judges
agreed that Trump wildly exaggerated the
values of his properties
which allowed him to get good loan rates
and maybe I don't know it couldn't have
helped his insurance but somehow he lied
on these things and exaggerated and it's
all illegal
so what do you think of that
when you first hear it and you haven't
heard the other side sounds pretty bad
doesn't it when you've only heard the
accusations and you haven't heard the
response yeah that's bad pretty bad it
you know it looks like he exaggerated
the size of things of the value of
things like maybe by billions Maybe by
billions of dollars terrible really bad
and uh you know with that kind of
criminal Behavior
I think we can feel bad for the uh the
victims
don't you I mean let's give a little bit
of thought to the victims of the crimes
so let's talk about the victims
let's see there were the banks that
testified they made a lot of money off
him
and the loans were all paid
the bankers had no problems
the bankers are not complaining
but that's okay but what about the
insurance
well he paid his insurance premiums
and if he said his property was more
valuable than it was
that would suggest he paid more
Insurance than he needed to
so maybe the insurance companies made
extra money
because they were ensuring things that
could be replaced at much lower cost
than he estimated it was its value
so let's see so the the victims made
money
or in another case they made money
and they were perfectly happy with the
arrangement
okay
and now I'd like to add some context
um I've often told you that two of the
best skills you could combine to
understand the world are number one
economics
if you know how business works and
number two persuasion hypnosis
persuasion those two things give you
this amazing uh visibility because
follow the money usually explains
everything right so if you understand
economics you know how to follow the
money and if you understand persuasion
you know what people are thinking and
that's pretty predictive as well
now I I have both of those backgrounds
and one of my backgrounds includes
working for a bank I have a degree in
economics an MBA and also an MBA and I
work for a big bank as a lender
I made business loans where I approved
them you know the branch would initiate
them they'd send it into headquarters
and I was one of a small group of people
who would look at them mostly for
doctors and lawyers and no doctors and
dentists mostly and there were small
business loans now
do you imagine that I did this just try
to imagine me getting the loan
application
that's a loan application
all right what does the person who wants
to borrow the money
say their house is worth
okay they say it's worth two million
dollars okay I will totally believe that
and now um I will base my approval or
disapproval on what the person who's
asking for the loan
says their worth
do you think that's ever happened in the
history of the world
no there's no Banker who believes people
who apply for things
do you think that if you say you're
worth something the bank goes well I
didn't know that okay
in no world
if no world has that ever happened
now even once
do you know do you know what I did when
people would do an application for a
loan
I would look at every number that
mattered and then I'd say prove it
so they had to show me their tax returns
for three years
do you think I believe what their income
was or do you think I just looked on
their tax returns
were they the same not always not always
but I what which one did I believe the
tax return or what they said they made
I believe the tax return that's the only
thing I looked at
when they said uh my business will be so
good you know it's gonna be a rocket and
I'll have 10 times as much money as I
need to pay back your loan did I take
their word for it do you think I took
their cash flow projection and said well
that looks good to me
no not even once I took their cash
projection and I reduced it by 75
percent
and I said well if they're off by that
much and they can still pay off the loan
this is a good deal
but if but if I depended on their their
projection they didn't get the loan
you know if I couldn't if I couldn't you
know make my own argument for why it
made sense I didn't make the loan I
didn't approve it
now what about if somebody says their
building is a certain size and therefore
is worth a certain value and they lied
that shouldn't make any difference
because they always send out an
appraiser the appraiser actually goes
out with a measuring device and measures
the size of things
like literally physically they measure
it and then they compare it to all the
comparables and they you know look at
look at your argument now in Trump's
case I think he made an argument that
the brand Trump added some value
do you think that the bank
considered the brand value which Trump
might have said oh that's worth billions
of dollars do you think that they
considered that when they made the loan
not if they were good Bankers no you
might if you were not a banker you might
say yeah that's I mean that has a real
value the brand has a genuine value so
therefore I will include that in my
analysis but if you're a banker oh no
no no you're you're not going to count
the Goodwill when you make a loan no
Goodwill is not part of the loan package
so do you think that the banks made an
exception for his case and said oh but
in this case his intangibles really are
important probably not
probably not they probably just looked
at the real estate they probably sent
their own appraiser and they probably
said all right that looks good
now is it possible that
Trump said something was worth I'll just
make up some numbers here is it possible
he said something was worth a billion
and therefore you should give me a
billion or even half a billion
but
like you can still pay off the loan
because he's got a good cash flow
I don't care that you lied about the
value of your house we checked it
ourselves and our own appraiser says
it's not nearly worthwhile you say this
but the loan still works the numbers
still work on the loan so no problem
they would just make that loan do you
think they would report Trump to the
police because he said his building was
bigger or was worth more than the
appraiser that they sent said no that's
business as usual
business as usual the bank wouldn't even
blink they just say oh wow his numbers
were way off but I'm glad we have our
numbers and we'll base it on that nobody
would even Blake that's so normal
now when I insured my house just a
private residence
is a little bit bigger than a normal
house and so the insurance company said
they wouldn't take my word for what it
was worth
like it would be easy to you know look
on Zillow and you can see the house and
yeah you could estimate what it was
worth based on comps and stuff like that
but that wasn't good enough at a certain
scale they send a person out to walk
around and that person you know measured
and asked a million questions about my
house and how it was built and all this
stuff now you don't think they did that
for a trump property
do you think they took his word for what
Mar-A-Lago was worth
you don't think they actually send
somebody to look at Mar-A-Lago
of course I did
of course they did
now one of the things I saw Eric Trump
uh argue was that uh I guess the the
legal
the what whoever it was in the legal
process said that Mar-A-Lago was worth
around 18 million dollars
now do any of you know anything about
real estate
do you think Mar-A-Lago is only worth 18
million dollars
that does that sound a little low now
Eric says that some estimates were up to
a billion dollars but that's a trump
estimate so you know I don't believe
Eric Trump's estimate is worth nearly a
billion but it's not worth nearly 18
million
18 million is just a crazy low number I
don't know what the number is but it's
not 18.
I don't think you have to be a real
estate expert to know that's low
so there's something going on here
that doesn't look uh too copacetic and
apparently uh
Trump lost business licenses in New York
I don't know which ones but they might
make it difficult or impossible to do
business in New York
so Trump
may not be able to do any business in
New York which presumably is a big Hub
of his real estate Empire
and
does this look like anything except
political
um it just looks completely political
right yeah it looks like he's being
hunted like a lot of Republicans
and
I'll tell you
if he survives this
which might require him to you know
pardon himself oh but he can't pardon
himself from State charges so he can't
even pardon himself out of this can he
but this might end up being more
financial than jail I don't know
um
but it does look like if he does get out
of this trouble
he should really jail everybody
including the prosecutors I think the
prosecutors in this case are acting
criminally
because I don't think that they're
treating him the way they would treat
other people
so if he if he got into office and
immediately had this prosecutor arrested
I don't think he could because there's
probably a state Affair not a federal
Affair but if he could I'd be okay with
that I think this prosecutor is not
doing the country's work and if there's
some crime that he could
uh you know in any way connect her to I
think she should be arrested because
this doesn't even look close to Justice
it's not even close it's not even in the
the zip code of anything that looks
credible or legitimate so yeah should
totally be arrested
all right
um
tonight are the uh the undercard debates
of the Republicans minus Trump who
wisely is not going
and let me tell you that the less that
Trump makes trouble
the stronger he is if he just doesn't
make new trouble and he just you know
says the same things he's always said
he's just going to sail into the office
it looks like you know lots could change
but at the moment that's the trajectory
so I'll be watching tonight
um I did
I did see a story that said that Fox
News was not getting the audience for
this uh based on the last debate they
the audience for the undercard debates
not that big because there's no Trump
um but I saw that Dana Perino is one of
three hosts so she'll be hosting that
tonight and
um
this will be interesting because I think
that Dana Perino will draw a big
audience
independent of the content
just because she's very popular
and
um I can't wait to see it I'm actually
very excited to see it
who are the other hosts
so the other host I'd already remember
their names it's uh Stuart Varney or
somebody
who is it
Stuart Varney from Fox Business and then
there's a Univision host whose name I
should say because I don't want to be a
jerk
what's the name of the Univision host
if you know that let me know
uh
uh you're just guessing at the name stop
guessing all right we don't know her
name but I'm sure she's very good
all right uh the Apple Store in
Philadelphia got looted along with a
bunch of other things in Philadelphia I
guess the looting's crazy
and
one BLM protester was yelling it just
started we finished lots more stores to
loot
now what would you do if you were
A store owner in Philadelphia
would you stick it out and say oh we can
we could work through this
or would you get the FN of Philadelphia
I'd probably get out
um in San Francisco and a bunch of other
places I guess Target stores are going
to close stores because there's too much
looting
and there are three of them that will be
closed in the Bay Area so my
hunting ground here will be three Bay
Area stores will close their targets
and looks like they'll shutter nine
stores across four different cities or
something
now what would you do if your Target and
you were in San Francisco and you kept
getting looted what would you do
would you stick it out
not me
I'd get the F out of there
um in our unrelated story
there was a study of how many applicants
for s p 100 jobs went to White
applicants after George Floyd's death
so after George Floyd died in the the
year that followed George Floyd's death
um only six percent of the people hired
by s p 100
were white
so 94 of the new hires were non-white
so for a year white people basically
couldn't get hired at the top 100
corporations in America
what would you do if you were a white
male they'll say male had to be worse if
you were a white male and
you knew that you couldn't get a job at
the s p 100 and if you did you're
definitely not going to get promoted so
even if you got lucky ah I'm into six
percent yes I made it into the s p 100
well that's the end of your journey
you got hired but you're not getting
promoted in that context so what would
you do
would you stick around at the s p 100
and keep trying harder
I wouldn't I would get the F out of
there just get the F out of there
all right
um
as I continue to be more right every day
let's go to this next story so Amazon's
been targeted by interestingly the
Federal Trade Commission now this is the
Biden Administration
going after Amazon in a really
aggressive way
meaning
um specifically for being a uh
Monopoly
so essentially the the charge is that
they force their sellers to do things
the sellers don't want to do such as use
Amazon's delivery service that costs
more Etc so the idea is that Amazon is
abusive to the smaller businesses that
they depend on for their supply of goods
and the the argument against that
which is pretty strong is that Amazon
has a razor thin margin
which looks the opposite of the Monopoly
it's a pretty good argument
it might be true they're doing all these
things but they're not doing all these
things and then reaping a monopoly like
profit
they're doing all these things because
they have a razor thin margin they
pretty much have to do those things or
there's no Amazon
so that's the idiots symbol simple
version of it so how interesting is it
that the Biden administration's FTC is
going hard at Amazon in a way that could
be like devastating if they were
successful I mean it could be really bad
at the same time Jeff Bezos owns a big
part of Amazon he owns a Washington Post
which most smart people who pay
attention to politics would say does the
bidding of the administration
how do they square that
is Jeff Bezos just saying
um you just lost the Washington Post
do you think Jeff Bezos is going to go
after the Biden Administration hard in
the Washington Post
because that's the opposite of what they
do
watch the fun so very much like Murdoch
you know one billionaire has an
interesting situation because he owns
The Wall Street Journal and Fox News one
is talking about Tick Tock and the
other was using them as an Advertiser
like it's a complicated World Jeff Bezos
has an even more complicated world
because the Biden Administration is you
know going after his main business while
depending on his other business
for their own future
and I think he just has to turn that
knob and the Washington Post goes out of
business
am I wrong
if I were Bezos I would tell the
administration I'm going to turn it off
do you know how much panicked they would
be if they lost the Washington Post
okay try to hold that in your head
if the Democrats lost the Washington
Post
they would be absolutely because
the Washington Post is their main source
of fake news is how they control the the
minds of their people The Washington
Post says it's true even if it isn't and
then the other followers say well it was
in The Washington Post so we're going to
go with it
so yeah New York Times is a slightly
different animal some say the Washington
Post is Cia directed and some say the
New York Times is FBA FBI directed I
don't know about any of that
but it looks like it it looks like it
so keep an eye on Washington post's
coverage of the Biden Administration I
would bet you that you're going to see a
turn toward he's too old and he's
decrepit and he's got to go
that's my guess
because I don't think Amazon is going to
put up or at least Bezos I don't think
he's going to put up with
being targeted at the same time he's
carrying water for the people who are
targeting him that doesn't feel
bezos-like does it
do you think one of the greatest
entrepreneurs in the world Bezos
is going to allow himself to be this
 without without a strong response
I doubt it it's going to get fun
well my next segment I call it's hard to
know if you killed a Russian leader
so
Ukraine had claimed that they killed
this General Victor sokolov who would
have been the commander of their Fleet
their naval fleet in the Black Sea and
they did a missile attack in Crimea and
they said they got him with a bunch of
others but he appeared on a video
uh seemingly alive and participating in
a meeting
does that sound familiar
sounds like uh sounds like the edit of
the Wagner group for Goshen yeah he's
dead he's totally dead wait why is he on
that video
oh he's totally dead he's on a video
again we can't tell so you really can't
tell if a Russian is alive or dead after
a certain level you know once they reach
like a general level
oh they might be dead or they might be
participating in meetings we're not
entirely sure either dead or in meetings
even though that's not a big difference
being dead and being in a meeting are
very similar
all right here's another story that I'm
sure we don't understand so Mexico
had a deal with a big Chinese Lithium
company that they were going to mine for
lithium in Mexico
and apparently there were some deal
points so the Chinese investor had to
meet some criteria
in order to be you know still allowed to
have this investment in Mexico and
Mexico just said nope you didn't do your
part and they're yanking back the rights
do you think that what really happened
was the Chinese Investment Company who
says they did everything they were
supposed to do do you think they did
everything they were supposed to do
and Mexico didn't know it so they're
making a mistake or did they not do what
they were supposed to do and Mexico is
just it's just business and so they're
just you know just doing what business
people do if you didn't do your part I
won't do my part
um or do you think that none of this
story is exactly what it looks like
to me it looks like Mexico just stole
back their own resources that maybe it
was a bad idea to license these
resources to a Chinese company but it
looks like they're just making up an
excuse to take them back now
do you think they did that on their own
or do you think the United States said
you know
we're going to let your cartels do
whatever they want but we really really
need lithium and we don't want to get it
all from China
so why don't you screw your Chinese
friends take back the lithium and we'll
help you develop a you know a mining
operation and
if you do that for us we'll go easy on
the cartels and let them keep operating
because the cartels and the Mexican
Government not that different entities
now I'm not saying that's what happened
I'm just saying it looks exactly like
that's what happened
that's all we know we know it looks like
that happened we certainly don't know
there's any connection between the
cartels and the lithium we don't know
that the United States had any
conversation with Mexico we don't know
if they just did it for their own
economic good
the other possibility is that the cartel
told the government to steal back the
resources because the cartel wants to
own the mine
totally possible it could be just the
cartels told them to steal it back from
Mexico and the Mexican Government said
ah okay we're going to do what you say
Maybe
I'm not sure lithium will be the
material of the future I'll tell you
this the story I'd love to see
is do we have a good grasp of Which rare
earth materials only are in China and
nobody else has any and nobody's trying
to create more
because um yeah rare earth materials are
not rare that is correct what is rare is
a country that is willing to exploit
them for a variety of reasons
yeah I feel like we are we're not well
served in the reporting because I can't
tell you that all our rare Earth mineral
problems are solved or it's unsolvable
or we're halfway to solving it or
there's one maybe there's one mineral or
material that we can't get but we did
we're doing okay on the others isn't
that super important like if you're
trying to figure out what's the future
of the country
you would need to know where we are on
these rare earth materials because
without them the technology sector just
dies
and I don't think that's
I don't remember seeing a story about it
you see a story about like one material
and a context
all right
so keep an eye on that
um San Francisco had tried to experiment
to
um
make sure that all the kids did well
because there were some segments of the
kids who were not doing well in math and
they thought they could fix it by
delaying the teaching of algebra to
ninth grade so normally they started
teaching in eighth grade and the
thinking was that some demographic of
the kids
could do math as well as everybody else
in ninth grade but they certainly
couldn't do it in eighth grade
because reasons reasons and stuff
that's why but I tried that for a while
and now this will be a deep surprise to
many of you deep surprise but it turns
out believe it or not
it didn't make a difference
can you believe that
it didn't it didn't fix the disparity it
was a racial disparity it turned out but
it didn't fix the disparity
by teaching it in ninth grade instead of
eighth grade it I are you are you Blown
Away by that it was such a good idea
so logical that it would work
and and that it didn't so it looks like
they're going to reverse it wow
quite a shocker
now let me ask you this question if your
child was really good in math and you
knew it from the beginning like from
first grade you could tell
and that kid looked like a
was headed for college and maybe some
kind of a professional career in which
math was important
what would you do if you were a kid had
to be in the school where math was being
degraded
so that everybody could catch up
what's the best strategy there stick it
out stay there and and just do the best
you can with the Lesser math
oh no it would be get the out of
there yeah you should take your kid out
of there and move to another town you
just get the out
all right
um unless you want your kid to have
fewer options for success
so we could have called today Scott is
right about everything but I feel that
would be too egocentric
even though I am so
did I miss any big stories
any big stories I missed
now
uh most can't afford to pick up and
leave no they can't but it's the only
way that they can get good math
at a Target store if you wanted to shop
at a Target store
and you wanted your children to have
math classes like everybody else
would you live in San Francisco
no if you did not want to walk on feces
when you go outside when you go to San
Francisco no
you would not
no you finally did a blip on Trump being
politically charged
well everybody knew that the charge was
political did you need to hear that from
me
it was sort of overtly obvious
all right
um
the new new ufo videos released by The
Border Patrol
uh sure anything anything to talk about
something that's not immigration
hey there's a lot of immigration on the
ground here look at all these immigrants
coming across legally it's like they're
all they're all military age look at
this well sure but look at that do you
see that no no where are you looking no
it's up there
where it's over there now
so that's sort of what's happening at
the border
so uh let me talk about uh uh why can I
never remember his name
the physicist scientist
Dyson
he's got a three-part name
Neil
Neil deGrasse Tyson Neil Degrassi Tyson
so he's getting a lot of attention for
being um
in favor of trans
athletes
trans competing on women's teams and I
was listening to his argument with some
podcasters I think trigonometry guys
went after him for it others have as
well but
I don't think he's as wrong as you think
now I'm not going to argue for Trans in
women's sports I think Sports should be
completely refigured so that everybody
gets to play on a team that makes sense
so I think those sports are broken but
that's a whole other conversation
everybody should have a place to play
people who are roughly their ability
whatever that takes you just have to
make that happen in my opinion but when
when Dyson is you know destroyed and the
right shows his how wrong he is I listen
to his argument and it didn't sound
wrong to me
let me tell you what I heard now maybe I
heard it wrong it might be a part I'm
missing so you can tell me if I missed
them I believe he knows that there's a
you know a genetic difference between a
man and a woman
so that part doesn't seem to be in
question
and I think that that's what people
thought he was doing but he knows you
know that if you're born with a certain
physical structure that that would be
the male or female gender so I don't
think I don't think he's questioning
that there's a physicality that's you
know that's part of sex that or the sex
identification
but he goes further he says that
sometimes people wake up and they feel
more feminine and they want to have
makeup on and someday they might wake up
and feel more masculine don't feel like
makeup dress like a boy and he's he says
that you have this infinite variety of
people and it's too simplistic to say
that they are just their chromosomes
they're just the X and the Y too
simplistic
I agree with that completely
what part of that do you disagree with
because I think he just said everything
you agree with he agrees that there's a
physical difference that's what all of
you think
he agrees that that physical difference
would you know make some people stronger
in sports nobody would argue that
but on top of that he says that people
have an internal feeling
in which they feel more like one gender
or another and he would like them to
have the freedom
to
self-identify in the way that they feel
what's wrong with that
if they're adults and they're not
bothering you do you have any problem
with that
do you have any problem with an adult
waking up anywhere and saying I feel
like makeup today
no
no he's actually very close to your
opinion and I think he's being unfairly
demonized you know I spend a lot of time
talking about people on the right who
are unfairly indicted or demonized but I
feel like I should defend people who may
have more of a left
reputation and I think that he's
unfairly being targeted
now he has some suggestions about how to
fix Sports which I have not evaluated
right he's not evaluated I haven't
evaluated that plan but I'm on the same
page that maybe you should look at the
structure of sports to make sure you
don't have big people and Little People
competing I saw a viral video the other
day
in which there was some young male
football competition
and one of the young men I think they
probably were age
10 years old you know just looking I'm
guessing they were some around maybe 10
years old and one of the 10 year olds
just happened to be enormous
so they were all boys but one of the
boys looked like he weighed 300 pounds
it was just a giant and they give this
big guy the ball and he just runs and
just mows down all these little kids
should that kid be playing with those
other kids
no no it looked very dangerous he was
way too big to be pushing these little
kids around no
so to me that problem of that big kid is
exactly the same as the problem of
somebody born male and has some physical
advantages and ended up on a woman's
team in both cases you need to fix it
when it's all man the way they fix it is
usually they have the the big one
play on a higher level team with older
kids
so that's that's a fix to the sport
without saying anything about anybody's
wrong like there's nothing wrong with
the big kid
there's nothing wrong with him he was
born big that's the whole story he's
just big
so fix the sports so he gets to play
where he doesn't hurt people and gets to
compete
so I'm pretty close to Neil Dyson Neil
Degrassi Dyson's view that people can be
people adults we're talking about adults
that people can be people but you're
still not it's you should get them a
fair place to play a sport that's all
now I don't think there's a perfect
answer for any of this
so now the the argument against Trans in
women's sports is partly that it takes
opportunities away from the the women
who were born as women
and that's true
so there probably should be a place that
only biological women can play
that'd be fine with me as long as
there's also a place that 100 of all
trans athletes also have a place to play
that makes sense and is good and you
know gives them what they need as
athletes Etc
so
I I think it's ridiculous that women
have their own
awards for sports
and that women have their own like
special
um
college scholarships
at the same time I don't think men
should get college scholarships either I
think Sports and college just shouldn't
mix but
that's the way it is I'm not going to
change it it's not like I care
but the problem was mixing Sports in
college in the first place didn't make
sense college sports should be
intramural college sports should be
everybody gets to play against somebody
that's the right level
when I played college sports which I
played a lot of
it was all intramural
and our teams were
usually at least when we're just messing
around usually co-ed
so we played co-ed soccer
and it was great
it was great nobody had a complaint
about it so anything that works is okay
with me I think we should look at our
systems and not just the individuals
you know so that's why I'm more
pro-trans and I think all of you because
I think that uh we need to fix the
systems for people not penalize the
people because they don't fit in the
system perfectly
and and what I say when I say change the
system let me be clear I'm not saying
change Sports for the benefit of trans
athletes
I think I think I misled you right I do
not say you should change Sports for the
benefit of trans athletes they're not
enough of them
but you should definitely change Sports
for the benefit of everybody
which means everybody has a team that's
the right level they can play on
including that giant kid who was playing
football that I talked about you should
fix it for him
and for the little kids he was knocking
over fix it for them and then
everybody's got something that they can
do
I don't think we should be rewarding
people for sports frankly I don't think
you should get money because you're good
at sports
maybe you should get money if you're
good at class work you know in college
because that's kind of what college is
supposed to do but no I don't think
anybody should get any special treatment
for being good in sports that's a hobby
Sports is a hobby
you shouldn't get paid for your hobby
all right
I'm picking winners and losers
am I
yeah North Korea returned an army
private
is that surprising
are you surprised that North Korea
returned the guy who tried to
defect
I feel like probably they didn't trust
him and they thought there was no
benefit in holding him or killing him
they probably thought he was a spy or
that he could be I don't think they got
any benefit from keeping him so
but I also wonder would they have
returned him
if Trump had never been president
if Trump had never you know softened up
Kim Jong-un
would they be returning that Soldier or
would they just hold the soldier for
leverage
I I feel like this
maybe is a trump
related thing I I would also not be
surprised
if Trump asks for it personally
if you were Trump
and you knew there was an American that
was being held in North Korea
and wouldn't you ask the state
department I think you should ask
permission but ask the state department
do you mind if I just send the personal
note to Kim Jong-un and say I feel I
feel a lot better about you
I'm probably going to be president again
I feel a lot better about you if you let
this guy go just sort of on the down low
and maybe even without any attention
because how long would it take it would
take Trump 10 minutes
to write a little person a letter
somebody else would deliver it
and then the guy goes free
do you think Trump would let that
opportunity pass when he probably knew
that one note would get him free
I I feel like you might find out Trump
was behind it
you might also find out well you
wouldn't find this out but it's possible
that Kim Jong-un is just playing
he's playing it cool because he thinks
Trump might come back
and you don't want to be on the wrong
side of trump when he comes back because
they're Buddies
so
what do we find out I think Trump would
tell us if he he would eventually tell
us if he was behind it
um
you know as Trump is coming back
your perspective that a sports serve for
people to feel good is unique
well it's not just to feel good I mean
obviously has some entertainment value
uh and some physical fitness value
Sports Excellence requires intelligence
work and reasoning and it belongs at
college boy that's a stretch
stretch because Sports require
intelligence work and reasoning it
belongs to college and that's really
trying hard
that's a real I mean I'm gonna have to
give you the
some kind of award for even attempting
that
all right
um
I do think sports are beneficial I don't
think having a uh a professional team in
a college
effectively
is good for anybody except the people on
the team and making money for the
college
Sports have given many poor people a
great opportunity for an education
really
many
what what percentage of poor people got
uh got college scholarships
and whenever you find whenever you find
a student
tell me if this is true or this is just
me being biased all right so this you
got to check my bias here
I feel like every time you hear there's
some really successful College athlete
unless I in the black community
specifically when you see there's like
some you know really successful high
school student who made it to College
what do you always find also
incredible parents am I right
just about every time and even the case
of that Blindside guy I don't know
what's true about that but the point was
that you know with good parenting the
kid thrived allegedly there might be
something else to that story but so I
ask you this
if that same kid who had these
incredible parents who created an
athlete with good character don't you
think that they would have created a
good citizen with good character
if the kid was good at school
if the kid was just a good student same
parents
aren't they going to create a really
good like executive of something because
the parents were so good and the kid
obviously had some qualities so I'm not
so sure that that was the one way that
those kids could be successful is sports
because they had something going on that
they had to have going on or they
wouldn't have even made it in sports
so there's that
you need to have good grades well
not good grades you don't need good
grades you just need to not have
terrible grades
um
all right somebody told me what I got
wrong about the trans topic
because a lot a lot just in one sentence
tell me what I got wrong and watch how
you will the thing you think I got wrong
I guarantee is a misinterpretation of my
question but go tell me what I got wrong
about the Translate
didn't talk about changing rooms
men will have a physical advantage of
course that's part of my opinion
so so so you don't actually have
anything that's counter to my opinion
God does not make mistakes that had
nothing to do with my opinion
somehow it feels has zero to do that
doesn't make sense
contradicting yourself with no details
um yeah so your your comments are
um obtuse
no nobody has an actual comment about my
opinion
it's degrading to women
in what way
how in the world is that degrading to
women
it's racist all right I I think people
have strong feelings about it because
they have preferences
if you have a preference that your
female athletes are on female only teams
just say it's a preference
I I wouldn't disagree with that because
your preference is your preference
you can have any preference you like I
wouldn't I wouldn't argue with your
preference
all right
um your preference is reality
one of the one of the biggest problems
on the right
and maybe it's the left to I just notice
it more on the right
is that people try to win arguments with
definitions
and so you should check yourself on this
on this uh dimension
here's what is not an argument
uh life starts at conception
it might be
your opinion
but it's not an argument
right that's not an argument that's a
definition
definitions are not arguments so you win
your you win your argument by just
putting a word on it oh it's alive
and then the alive part you know wins
you the argument that's not an argument
that's just the definition
and the same goes with the Trans stuff
a lot of people are trying to win the
argument just by saying a woman is a
woman
all right we all agree that there are
certain chromosomal you know situations
it's not an argument
it's the opposite of an argument it's
just trying to win by a definition
so
a lot of people when when I ask what's
wrong with my opinion you see a lot of
spinning it's because people are doing
word thinking and as soon as you say all
right well if you leave the word
thinking where you're winning by
definition of words give me the argument
or tell me why I'm wrong there's nothing
there it just turns to dust because a
lot of our a lot of what we think is
intelligence is just like AI
intelligence where it's just the
combination of words
gives you the impression of intelligence
and on the big issues where you just
have a feeling about something
all you're doing is searching for the
word patterns that support your point of
view
because with trans people really feel
something about that topic
and it's the feeling that makes your
decision and then you rationalize it
after the fact
same with abortion abortion is bad you
feel about it and then you reason
backwards from your feelings to get your
conclusion
that's how it works
all right
um
I guess that's all I have to do to
offend everybody today thanks for
joining YouTube I will talk to you
tomorrow
