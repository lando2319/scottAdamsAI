good morning ladies and gentlemen and
welcome to the best thing that ever
happened to you it's a highlight of
civilization
and there's never been a fighter thing
that's ever happened but if you'd like
to take this experience up to
oh I don't know
the heights of a Chinese spy balloon all
you need is a cup of mug or a glass of
tanker chalices dying the canteen Joker
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and it's going to happen now coming at
you hard
save rent
savor it
okay good
well
um here's the most important question of
the day I know there's a lot of big news
you'll want to hear all of it we'll talk
about it but I got to start with the
most important one
um it was sort of a question I had
yesterday
so I tweeted it if Joe Biden is called
POTUS p-o-t-u-s and Jill Biden his wife
is called the FLOTUS
what is Hunter Biden
anybody have an answer if Joe Biden is
POTUS and Jill Biden is FLOTUS what is
Hunter Biden I suggested scrotus
scrotus
but uh I thought that was pretty darn
clever
until uh Twitter user David
said what
suggested uh even better than scrotus
would be snort us
so the POTUS the FLOTUS of the snortis
commands nordis is pretty good I wish
I'd said that
well apparently Biden is going to prove
some massive drilling
project in Alaska I did not see that
coming
did everybody see Biden approves massive
Drilling
in Alaska
is it possible that
that he always would have yeah is it
possible that he was always going to
approve it and there's nothing unusual
about it
or is he saying that he destroyed the
world with his energy policy
and he's you know trying to adjust or is
it because the election is coming and he
needs to be able to say I approved all
kinds of oil I approved more oil than
Trump did
I think that's the play right
he just needs to say he's he approved
more oil than Trump did to run for
president
now here's the question I have
how was it ever possible
that activists
beat the big oil money lobbying machine
didn't you always assume that the oil
and the energy companies completely
controlled Congress completely
controlled the president
but it turns out that Greta
you know using her as just a symbol of
the activists they were more powerful
than the money people for a long time
but maybe that's reversed yeah it could
be that the money people
you know up their bid they may have
increased their bid
so you never know this is exactly the
kind of story where you think you might
know something about it because you read
the news
do you think we understand this story
because we read the news
Mike this is exactly the kind of story
where there's you know layers and
variables that we don't know about
oh well
um I saw a clip from real time Bill
Maher must have vaired last night in
which
in which Bill Maher mentions uh Elon
musk's plan to build a city in Austin
that he's calling a Utopia a Utopia and
what did his Democrat guests do when
Bill Maher said that musk wants to build
a Utopia
see if this sounds familiar
they immediately they immediately leapt
to the idea that Utopia was a literal
word
and not hyperbole
have you ever seen Democrats not
understand the difference between
hyperbole
when it's really obvious like Utopia
sort of an obvious YouTube that's like
really really obvious
and they treated it like he meant it
like he meant it
so instead of so instead of saying oh
it's a city where costs might be low and
it's very efficient
that's probably all Elon means it's just
efficient it just works well it's well
designed and they went to and they
actually did the Democrat face
have you ever seen Democrat face when
they don't have an argument
they go to mocking that market
you know that face so watching the panel
go into Democrat face
and and poor Bill Maher
who actually has you know some semblance
of uh ability to see the whole field
you know unlike all of his guests
he's trying to explain to them without
ruining their fun
the Elon Musk yeah they did he did build
an electric car you weren't expecting
and
he did
build rocket that can land
by itself and he is going to Mars uh
maybe the city ideas isn't totally crazy
yeah yeah just putting that out there
maybe he has some good ideas to build
the city
but it's just amazing watching the like
they have to use their face when they
have no argument
yeah you can imagine the the mental
process
hearing things I don't like
must make logical argument to refute
searching searching for logical argument
to refute the concept the Elon Musk
might know how to build some things that
other people don't know how to build
don't know what to do
must default to facial expressions
now
if you're list if you're listening on a
podcast
uh I'm just kidding I'm canceled on
podcasts
did you know that apparently I I think
Apple dropped me from the podcast store
it could be a technical problem it might
be a technical problem
but as far as you know this is not on
podcasts anymore as of a few days ago
right
uh is can anybody confirm yeah I'm
canceled on the Apple Store
I think it could be a technical problem
so don't assume until I look into it
right um
Elon Musk all the stories about Elon
Musk today
so Elon musk's tweeted free Jacob
chansley who you know as the Q Anon
Shaman who's in jail for doing nothing
dangerous on January 6.
and telling people to go home because
Trump tweeted it and walking around in a
friendly manner with the law enforcement
of people
so still in jail and Elon Musk who's
calling it then of course somebody
immediately accused him of being a Maga
guy
like that's all Democrats have now is oh
well I've got a good insult how about my
insults I hear your good reasons and
your data but have you seen my ad
hominems I'd call that a tie with me a
little bit ahead that's what I call a
tie
um can you remind me to say something
about Equity toward the end
I got this great Equity point that I
keep wanting to fit in somewhere but
remind me at the end
all right uh
so then Elon tweeted I'm not part of
Mega but I do believe In fairness of
Justice Chancellor was falsely portrayed
in the media as a violent criminal who
tried to overthrow the state and who
urged others to commit to violence that
was the exact opposite of who he was and
Elon goes in but here he here he is
urging people to be peaceful and go home
and the other video shows him calmly
walking to the in the Capitol Building
being escorted by officers and then
thanking the officers
this is yet another one of those
situations where the you know internet
dads are trying to help again dads is
not necessarily just men but people who
have a certain uh perspective on life
sort of a dad Vibe and I think Elon is
the greatest dad vibe
of of anybody at this point
um because this is just a person this is
a non-political opinion
wouldn't you say
does anything does anything there's do
you think elon's opinion looks political
I don't see any politics in it
whatsoever
somebody says Spotify was airing my
podcast yesterday so that's good news
yeah this is not even it's not even
political this is about a citizen and
the legal system there's no politics in
this whatsoever you know the larger
event was but not not Jacob
this is not a political question at all
now I got two million uh
views on a tweet
where I said that the Republicans should
close Congress until they free Jacob
chancelly
and I just don't have a better idea do
you
it would be one thing if there were if
we had some doubt about well you know
maybe the legal system should work this
out because we don't know all the facts
but we know enough
I feel like we know enough
and there and by the way there's no
counter narrative
that I'm aware of have you seen a is
there any counter narrative that says oh
yeah that that Q Anon shamani actually
stabbed a guy nobody's saying that
nobody is saying that the video is fake
we've now seen enough that Reasonable
Doubt is a reasonable doubt is just so
all over this
if not I'll write the most innocent
anybody could be at the very at least at
the very least
you know you didn't hurt anybody and
there's a lot of doubt about whether any
crime was committed that he was aware of
I don't think he was aware of any crime
it looked like he was allowed in you
know that was my take on it it looked
like they didn't mind him being in there
it could let it walk around do your
thing then leave
so do you have a better idea than
Republicans just saying you know we're
done
we're done just close Congress we're not
going to take a meeting we're just going
to cancel everything cancel all just
clear my schedule Congress is closed
now in a perfect world it would only
take one day for that to work
but I can't think of another idea can
you
I I know it won't work
forming a protest and going down to
where he's being held
pretty sure protests won't help
Am I Wrong there's no way a protest is
going to make any difference they'll
just arrest more protesters they'll say
oh there's more of those Mega
insurrectionists let's get them round
them up so that's not going to work so
if you can't protest
and the legal system is just clearly
broken
I mean in my opinion that is just a
broken system
we all see it
there I don't think there's any
ambiguity about this one we all say it
and I and I get the argument that they
they you know most of the ones for being
held for non-violent crime should be
pardoned I get that but this one is so
plain and so easy and so obvious
how do Republicans let this stand
not because the Republicans mind you but
because they want a justice system that
works it's not even political now I
would say everybody in Congress should
you know do something but you know the
Democrats won't you know they just won't
so
I don't know do you have a better idea
do you think we can just let it slide
is this something we can just let go
and let me let me uh answer one critic
who said Scott
do you think this is like the most
important thing happening
do you think this is the most you know
Injustice this is the Injustice you
decided to focus on you know what this
one person this one guy
and my response was no it's not the only
Injustice
it's the easiest one to fix
that's what's pissing us off
it's the easiest one to fix and they're
not doing it
now the fact that we're not fixing
systemic Justice or systemic racism
overnight I get that that's hard
yeah that doesn't happen overnight but
this really should happen in an hour
there's no reason he's he should be in
there for one more hour we all see it
it's obvious this system is absolutely
disrespecting us
this is disrespect
of the citizens absolute disrespect and
maybe our system needs to learn to
respect us
now I don't think that the protest would
work
I'd like our leaders to shut the
government down just shut the
government because if the government
can't fix this thing I don't
want it I don't even want a government
uh this is a special note
to people who don't understand hyperbole
in the wild
sometimes Scott says things which were
intended
to make a point
that if it is taken in its literal sense
it could be misleading to NPCs and
Democrats this has been a notice for
NPCs and people who don't understand
Hyperbole and context
except that I do mean shut the
government
I literally mean it I mean just disclose
the doors walk away you need to fix this
we're private
all right here's a uh
uh persuasion lesson on spotting word
salad
now the way the word salad arises
usually is from cognitive dissonance
cognitive dissonance arises from
uh where somebody has a world view that
there sure is right and then there's
really solid evidence that it was never
right
usually people don't say oh wow I've
been wrong for so long and now I have
new information I completely revise my
worldview to make it compatible with
this new information which looks solid
Nobody Does that Nobody Does it
all right
um
what they do instead is they try to
argue their Old Point that's been
debunked
except there are no arguments because
the new information obliterates the
arguments so what people will do
typically and not because they're done
this is very important
this happens to smart people
just as easily as anybody else they
start talking in word salad
so it's words that form sentences
but they're just complete nonsense and
I'm going to give you an example so you
can better recognize it in the wild
so this is from Ricky Flores on Twitter
is responding to the the my calls for
Jacob chancelly to be freaked based on
the new video that totally destroys The
Narrative of January 6 but we all know
there were violence there that's not the
part that is destroyed just that the
general character of the people there
was protest and not Insurrection even
though some were violent
but Ricky now uh evidently and I say
evidently because he's exhibiting the
tell for cognitive dissonance it means
that the videos have just messed up his
worldview watch this answer now he's
responding to me and he says you don't
get it and you never will what's that
you don't get it and you never will
that's an odd ad hominem
ad hominem yeah if somebody starts with
an ad hominem usually it's there's a
cognitive problem going on
because when people have reasons
they give the reason first
it's not that people won't insult you
know everybody insults everybody is just
sort of the way of the world but when
people have a reason to really dunk on
you like oh apparently you're forgetting
this data boom and then they call you an
idiot or they might say well you're an
idiot because of this data
so it's not just the insult right it's
the insult without anything else
all right so so watch see if see if you
think the insult gets backed up right
you don't get it and you never will
access to the capital was closed off
the formal affirmation of the will of
the people attacked
law enforcement didn't know how to
respond never happened in history there
was no Playbook it was still
insurrection
do any of those sentences have anything
to do with the other sentences
that's obvious word salad right do you
recognize it
let me break it down again so here are
the parts you don't get it and you never
will that's just ad hominem so we'll see
if he backs it up with some kind of data
or argument it says access to the
capital was closed off Jack I know that
the formal affirmation of the will of
the people was attacked
meaning the the verification or the
validation of the vote
now
is that the way real people talk
yeah those people that day they they
were attacking the formal affirmation of
the will of the people
do you remember the part of the cons the
Constitution that specifies whatever you
do
don't attack the formal affirmation of
the will of the people
whoa stay away from the formal
affirmation of the will of the people
so that's not that's what they were
there for they were there to stop the
process yes everybody knows that
so so far he's insulted me and told me
two things that everybody knows Capital
was closed off and they were there to
stop that process then he says law law
enforcement didn't know how to respond
yes never happened in history yes there
was no Playbook yes it was still an
Insurrection what
what what did any of those sentences
have to do with supporting that it was
an insurrection
he just started out by saying that they
were there to attack the affirmation of
the will of the people
well they were there to delay today
which is exactly what they said to make
sure everything got done right if there
was a way to check it
so have I made my case
this is somebody who can put together
sentences that are complex so we would
assume that Ricky has
he's smart I assume Ricky's smart
because he can put together complex
sentences but
am I wrong that this is word salad
it's actually just nonsense put together
yeah and that's what you look for you
look for the nonsense sentences that are
still uh perfectly well constructed in
terms of grammar they're just weird
all right
um let's talk about this Silicon Valley
Bank
so as most of you know by now big Bank
in Silicon Valley a really big bank has
been taken over by Regulators because
it's insolvent and a lot of people are
going to lose their money
up to 250 000 per account that's
guaranteed by the government
but so that's the basic idea now the big
question is whether this is part of a
you know some larger Bank Run that's
going to happen or if it's a one-off
the quick answer is it's probably a
one-off
unless
the public imagines is not
if the public imagines there's a problem
it does become a bank run
if the public
doesn't
then it probably won't
now
let me be very clear I do not give you
Financial advice do not take my advice
on what you should do with your money
I will tell you what I'm doing
nothing
except I'm making sure that my accounts
to the to the degree that I can manage
it I make sure that I don't have too
many that are over that limit right
so I might balance two accounts just to
get them under that limit but that's all
I would do
now here's why
where would you put your money
where would you put it
like where's the good place to put it
I can't think of one
now
some some people are saying gold and buy
shorts and stuff like that but you know
that's all just a different kind of risk
right so what happens if I buy a bunch
of gold and it's probably already
running up
and then the banks don't fail
well I got a bunch of gold that's going
to start running back down because the
banks didn't fail
so that's just another risk
now you can say but but but the bank
risk is I'll lose everything
now if the big Banks fail
it's not a bank problem
I hate to tell you but if the big Banks
all fail like or even just most of them
or something
that's that's the end of the game
that's just sort of the end of the game
yeah we're all dead sort of thing so I
don't think it's going to happen
so I I think the odds are the banks will
take a hit
and then people will do what I did
which is what's what's Warren Buffett
doing
what's Warren Buffett doing did Warren
Buffett sell his Wells Fargo stock he
has a ton of Wells Fargo stock like a
lot
did he sell his Wells Fargo stuff
if he doesn't
I'll probably
you know trust Wells Fargo because I
don't know what's going on but I think
he does
I really don't know what's going on but
I think
you know Berkshire Hathaway has a better
take on it than I do so
this is a case of the the media will be
trying to scare people because they get
you know the extra clicks I watched
Tucker last night
I had to turn it off
I was he was just scaring me
but he was scaring me without a basis of
facts
you know it was more like it could be
bad
I get that
right everything could be bad everything
could turn into a disaster but the more
you talk about it the more you cause it
to happen
and so this is going to be sort of a
battle for the minds of Americans and
others I guess it's a battle for Mayans
and I'm gonna I'm gonna be battling on
the side of uh calm down
and I hope that the so-called internet
dads the people were you know at least
can see the field and are just in it for
making making the country better
um I'm hoping that the internet dads are
on the same side
like to calm down everything will be
fine it was a one-off there was
something about that bank that wasn't
like other Banks I I don't need to get
into the details but the people who are
closest to it see that as something that
shouldn't affect other Banks unless you
think it does
if you think it affects the other Banks
then it will because people will act
upon that belief
and start taking the money outside but
where are you going to put it mattress
I I can't think of anything safe
no idea yeah I mean I don't even know if
buying stocks is a good idea
is it I don't know so don't take my
advice about anything I'm going to be
persuading toward calm but that's not
Financial advice do you get the
difference
that's not Financial advice I'm just
saying don't don't buy that the degree
of the scare
put it in context the context is that
the media and social media will try to
get you scared
so everything looks scarier
when the media talks about it
that doesn't mean it won't go bad
I got to say that a hundred times I
don't know which way things are going to
go if I had to bet on it
well I am betting on it I guess I am
betting on it so yeah I'm basically
betting my entire fortune that will be
okay
I guess I am doing that I mean we're all
doing that right but some people are
betting their fortune that it won't be
okay and they're taking their money out
now the reason I think it'll be okay is
because it has to be
does that make sense
it has to be
like what whatever we have to do this is
one of those situations where the
government will do whatever it has to do
like if they have to send in the
military to stand in front of the bank
they'll do that
like I don't think they'll do that but
there's probably nothing they won't do
they'll create money out of nothing
they'll
put people in jail for saying it's bad
which I don't don't approve of but when
you get to the point where people will
do whatever it takes
that's probably a safer place than you
think because everybody's going to be on
the side of trying to keep the bank
solvent there's nobody on the other side
like maybe a few uh weird investors or
something but basically everybody wants
the banks to survive so we'll do
whatever it takes and people will jump
through as many Hoops as they need to
make that work so I'm going to bet on
humans
this time
don't always but this time I'm going to
bat on the you know the Adam's law of
slow-moving disasters and I'm gonna
I'm going to believe that this is slow
enough
it's not very slow
but it might be slow enough
that we can figure out how to you know
crawl through it so I think we'll be
okay
but do not take my advice okay
um
all right
[Applause]
so
it's of course turned uh totally
political
so here's what the Democrats are saying
they're saying that Peter Thiel who once
backed Trump caused the whole thing so
Peter thiel's fault according to what
some Democrats because his Founders fund
apparently told its members to get their
money out because the bank was uh not
solvent or soon would not be
so I hate to say it but this is one of
the greatest calls Peter Thiel ever made
and he at least got his own people's
money out but the net effect of that
might be crashing all banks
now it's not
what he did is not immoral or unethical
it's not it's a free market and smart
people do what they need to do to
protect themselves it's supposed to work
that way but Democrats are using that as
you know some some X I think he's X mega
some ex-mega looking guy
caused it all because rich people are
evil or something but the GOP has a
different story that it's all caused by
Biden's inflationary spending ESG
and maybe more
um so here's the argument for Biden
inflation so most of you are not
economists
so it's a little hard to understand the
story
but let's see if I can simplify it Banks
make money
by holding your deposits and paying you
less interest rate than they make by
using your money to make loans that's
the simplest simplest explanation
but instead of making loans
which might be a good return for their
money
and that would be more than they're
paying and then they'd be fine they took
the government's advice and bought these
low interest rate long-term
Federal instruments
so they locked themselves into a low
interest rate for their income while
while the price that they would have to
pay for money was moving around and was
obviously going to go up
so in other words
the most basic thing a bank does which
is make sure that the money they're
paying to people is less than the money
they're charging people
they got that wrong
they got that wrong now part of it was
they predicted wrong right
they predicted wrong that the interest
rates would go up and then they would be
locked in but who didn't know where
interest rates were going to go up like
who in the world didn't know that
everybody knew that we've been saying
for years and it's just math if you have
enough spending interest rates are going
to go up inflation blah blah blah right
so
I think the Biden causes inflation and
then the bank did not manage their
portfolio correctly in that environment
um is maybe a problem that other banks
are not going to have
my guess is Wells Fargo didn't do that
right my guess is Chase did not do that
I'm pretty sure they didn't
so they should be fine unless everybody
panics
here's the argument for ESG so we know
that the company was like big on
signaling their their awesome social
stuff
uh you think Yellen didn't know well
that's another problem
uh
and if they were focusing on their ESG
stuff
um
were they looking backwards and looking
in all the wrong places when they should
have been focusing on their banking so
this this is uh Vivek ramaswamy is
making in this case
now the case is we don't know
we don't know if the ESG policies had
had an impact but we do know they were
super focused on ESG which does not keep
your bank solvent
and the implication is maybe they should
have focused a little bit more on
quality for example ESG says you want
more diversity in your management and
everywhere else
so one thing to look at is did they hire
unqualified people
because they needed diversity
and they gave up some competence
that's a really serious question that
I'm not allowed to ask
in theory
uh
no matter what you think of anybody's
qualities in any group
well even if you know even if everybody
had the same training and and competence
like every person in the United States
if you're working toward diversity
you might run out of people because
everybody's trying to get be diverse you
would run out of
the the best diverse hires
and then you would naturally have to
move down to the second tier
to to manage your diversity it's like oh
you know Pepsi got all the good
diversity hires but we still need some
so we can't get the a plus students and
now we're getting the a minus students
still good a minus is fine
and then you you run out of a minus
students and you're still not diverse
you got to go to b-plus
you get some b-plus students right just
talking generically or not really
students but you get to be pluses here's
my question
do you want your man do you want your
money managed by a B plus and again it
has nothing to do with the the the
individuals
I'm saying that math alone
you know supply and demand there's an
under supply of people that are in high
demand
so in theory the only way they can solve
ESG and look good is to go down to some
b-plus competence and B plus probably is
not enough to keep your bank alive
if you've got B plus confidence you know
at the teller window you're probably
fine
but if your B plus competence is
managing the entire existence of your
bank
you know maybe you need an A minus maybe
you need a plus
and again it has nothing to do with any
particular race it's just a spline and
demand if you run out of Supply you
gotta you gotta go where you can get it
and you're going to go down lower in the
competence area there's no way around
that that's just math has nothing to do
with race
or it has nothing to do with racial
differences you would get the same
result if you reversed all the races
um
all right in the long run that should
work itself out but in the short run it
would cause distortions
all right
um
so I I guess I hope the internet dads
win and convince people to not go nuts
today
um
[Applause]
yeah
so Jim Cramer had a bad month
you know people like to dump on Jim
Cramer he always he recommends stocks
and one of the things I always was
amazed about him is you could name any
stock
you know people could call in and say
what about amb
and and Jim Cramer will say with total
confidence A and B has uh good assets
and balance sheet and then it'll tell
you whether to buy them or hold them and
I always thought how does he do that
they're like 10 000 stocks and people
will just call with any stock and he can
tell you the pros and cons of that stock
well it turns out
uh
maybe he has some blind spots because he
recommended people invest in Silicon
Valley Bank a few weeks before it went
under
now
that to be fair to Jim Cramer to be fair
people who pick stocks and advise on
stocks they usually don't know what's
happening in the company did you know
that
the experts they usually don't know
they really don't how would they know
how would they know
like even if they talk to the company do
you think the company tells them the
truth
if Kramer has lunch with the CEO of a
company
is the CEO going to lean over and say
you know I got to be honest
our balance sheet is it looks good on
paper but way in a month from now it's
going to go right to toilet who do you
talk to
how could Jim Cramer possibly know
anything about a company
he only knows what they tell him
and that's usually a lie because they're
you know spending things so his business
model has a flaw that people imagine
that anybody can pick stocks accurately
it's not actually even a thing
it's not something that Kramer is doing
poorly
it's actually not a thing
does that make sense
he's in the job of picking stocks and
picking individual stocks and winning at
it is not even a thing
s Warren Buffett hey Warren Buffett do
you think it's a good idea for
individual investors to pick individual
stocks based on their own research and
maybe the advice of experts he would
laugh at you Warren Buffett would laugh
at you for taking anybody's advice
including your own on buying individual
stocks he says that's a loser's game
basically yeah that's what fools do
so did Jim Cramer have a bad month
or is what he does Impossible by
definition well not definition but it's
impossible in the real world so it's
just sort of guessing in the end yeah so
I'm not sure he had a bad month I think
he was doing something that isn't even
possible and we should not be surprised
he didn't succeed this one time
yeah I'm sure he's got lots of others
wrong but how of course of course
uh somebody asked Elon Musk on Twitter
uh about buying the failed bank and
making it a digital Bank
now
that's a too big of a question for me to
know whether that's a good or bad idea
digital sounds crypto crypto sounds
risky so you know my bias is I don't see
how that's going to work but uh Elon
Elon Musk replies I'm open to the idea
now I don't think it was a joke
I think it was actually open to the idea
so that would be interesting imagine if
you could buy let's say the intellectual
property of Silicon Valley Bank you know
the name and the corporation structure
but not the debts
you know or not the
not the assets or something
well I think you could do that could you
I know so but I wonder if there's
anything there
maybe he has an idea for making a
digital Bank work
seems like it's all going to be digital
money eventually
let me ask you this
you don't believe
the the you don't believe we'll be using
like paper money
um and checks 10 years from now do you
think in 10 years we'll be using paper
money and writing paper checks
it seems to me that digital money is not
a question it's just a guarantee
yeah you do
so the only reason for keeping digital
money is for crimes
am I wrong
I guess you could say privacy
but why do you need privacy if you're
not committing a crime
because it's not like your neighbors are
looking at your checking account it's
only the government
the government only cares if you're
committing a crime as far as I know
so yeah let me say this I'm not
unambiguously in favor of digital
currency because all the tracking and
privacy I get that like it's creepy and
it probably will hurt us
but it is also inevitable
there's no way in the world we're going
to keep paper money
in the long term
and there's no way in the world we're
going to be writing checks
in the long term that's just not going
to happen
so so it's one of these arguments where
if you're arguing the pros and the cons
you're just talking
because it's not like you're going to
stop it
you're not going to stop it it's just
going to happen
there's no way around it
does anybody some of you actually think
about paper money in 10 years if I said
20 years do you think you'll still have
paper money
I don't think there's a chance
yeah you do okay well I mean I I can't
see the future so maybe you're right
but I'd be super surprised
all right
um speaking of Elon musk's uh future
city plans somebody on Twitter said that
his brother Kimball
is investing in vertical Farms which
would be an indoor Farm I guess
is that true
Kimball musk is investing in vertical
farming indoor farming
because I I think he follows me on
I think Kimball follows me on Twitter he
tweeted at me the other day so I'm going
to ask him about that because that's one
of my
um personal interests I also have a
small investment in indoor gardening but
smaller scale obviously
um
Democrats appear more lost than usual
but maybe it's just because of the
anecdotal stuff
uh
representative Sylvia Garcia
you remember she was grilling uh that
taibi and Michael schellenberger and
the Ridiculousness of her lack of
preparation to she believed those that
those two guys were Maga
like that's not doing any homework at
all she didn't know they were like
legitimate uh she didn't know they were
journalists
now if you've been paying attention
for the past few years can you name
anybody who's a better journalist than
either one of them
like who's beating them
you know Glenn Greenwald maybe you know
Barry Weiss yeah Barry Weiss Glenn
Greenwald but there's a very
there are only maybe
10 journalists in the country or not
absolute garbage
am I wrong
there are probably 10 good journalists
in the whole country
and they're right at the top of the best
journalists in the whole country
it's just crazy and Democrats don't even
know it like they didn't even know their
names
crazy
I mean I'm not wrong there are only 10
like really
useful journalists in the country and
they're definitely in the top ten
so uh so that's crazy
and uh
all right I'm going to show you a couple
of comics that I did for the locals
subscription Group by the way the only
place you'll be able to see Dilbert on
Monday of this coming week will be on
the locals subscription site five bucks
a month if you buy an annual admission
and for that you would see not only the
only new dilberts which will be called
Dilbert reborn and it will be edgier and
spicier because it's not subject to the
editorial control of newspapers finally
I'm free and it also includes My Side
comic of robots read news that I do once
in a while
and also my micro lessons which I'll be
adding to I think I'll be adding one
today over 200 micro lessons uh two to
four minutes each one will give you a
life skill
that will change you forever change you
forever but uh and there's a lot a lot
more on there uh commentary Etc
so it's all the good stuff
um but here's some robots to read news
jokes that I read that I wrote about
Silicon Valley bank before I realized
how bad it was
I'm not sure I would have written these
jokes
um when I had yeah it was sort of when
the news first broke but when you
actually think of the the real life
impact on real citizens of the country
some of whom lost everything
like it's not funny
right so just to be clear
is not funny what happened to the people
who lost their money yeah it's easy to
say oh you rich investors lost some
money blah blah blah but it's not all
rich investors right they're real people
who just got killed in that but
uh it doesn't mean that there aren't
funny things to be said so here in
robust read news where the robot is
always the same he never moves he just
reads the news first one I tried was and
I wrote These in concert with the uh the
people and locals who subscribe so I was
in my man cave last night just turned it
on and I had them help me write these so
this is a combination of my writing plus
suggestions and input from them all
right so the robust has a Silicon Valley
Bank has been shut down by Regulators
their big mistake was investing all of
their money in saucer-shaped weather
balloons nordstream 2 and Dilbert nfts
their only remaining assets are Hunter
Biden paintings he made with his penis
so that that was with the help of the
locals people but then we we thought of
another one that seemed even funnier so
I just wrote another one and that that's
the beauty of robots read news I can
crank one out in 10 minutes and have it
published
uh so the robot says Silicon Valley Bank
has been shut down by Regulators in
related news the Silicon Valley sperm
bank is also insolvent because
of a lack of donor liquidity
lack of donor liquidity
well
if I had all of my money in Silicon
Valley Bank
I don't think I could
I don't even think I could jerk off
and I could do that when I've got the
flu
I can masturbate when I have the flu but
if I had all my bad all my money in the
Silicon Valley Bank I think I'd be
I think my liquidity would be drying up
pretty quickly so
anyway so the uh here's a lesson on
writing a joke here's a joke writing
lesson I taught this to the to the
locals people last night
the the punchline here about the lack of
donor liquidity requires you to do an
extra bit of thinking on your own so
instead of just giving you the punch
line here it is ha ha I give you the
punch line you go what's he mean by that
oh I get it and it's that little bit of
what's he mean yeah like the people are
so upset they're dehydrated and they
can't function and stuff
so it takes you just a little bit of
time
a little bit of time to like connect the
dots and that's what makes it funny it's
that little time that connected the dots
so that's your lesson now I promise you
I'd give you another lesson so you
learned about word salad and how to
write a joke and now you're going to
learn how to spot an NPC
the NPCs are so consistent that I
started making a list of the things they
say so you can spot them too
here are things that NPCs say that
identify them as NPCs and you can just
ignore them from that point on it makes
them funny so this is kind of a reframe
if you think you're critics
are well-meaning citizens who have a bad
feeling about you
that's going to make you feel bad I hate
it when citizens have a bad feeling
about me I don't like it at all
but if I knew that the person who was
criticizing me
was an NPC and not a player I'd say oh
okay it's just and that's just
background scenery
so here are some things to recognize the
background scenery of an NPC
you're just an apologist
okay or maybe I just have an opinion
maybe I just have a different opinion
how about that how about I think
differently than you do maybe that's the
entire story maybe I'm not an apologist
or how about your offense Center you're
a racist keep digging walking it back
flip-flopping and then my two favorites
you're afraid of whatever
the the mind reading you're afraid of
okay or what you really think is no I
said what I really think
or I saw the video there is no other way
to interpret it
yeah there's another way to interpret it
it's edited to reverse the meaning
that's the other way pretty easy it
wasn't didn't take any work at all or
how about uh
you said all of the people in that group
when you said black people like hip-hop
music you were saying all of them and
that's racist no nobody means all of
them no matter what they say they never
mean all of them doesn't mean just black
people doesn't mean just Mega people
it's never all of them it's never ever
all of them only NPCs say that
and you're only doing this for clicks
this is what I'm getting now
so I you know I'm saying some more
provocative thing in the in the minds of
other people and they're saying you're
just doing it for clicks
that's a little
lacking all the variables
there there are more variables than
clicks
but the NPCs can handle one variable at
a time so that's how you spell it
all right
um here's some of the imaginary problems
that Democrats are working about
uh they're
the Democrats are very worked up about
two imaginary Maga guys
Matt Tybee and Michael schellenberger
they're imaginary now the the people
exist
but they've never been associated with
Maga
so but the Democrats want to get rid of
those Mega guys that don't exist
um
Biden is talking out against the
imaginary Geo plan GOP plan to defund
the police
which as you know not only doesn't exist
it's the literal opposite of the GOP
opinion which is let's fund those police
some more
but the Democrats have an imaginary task
there to beat
and then they're working on the
imaginary Insurrection led by the
imaginary bad guy q and Q Anon shaman
do Republicans work on that many
imaginary problems
like does it work both ways
it might it might it might work both
ways
but I'm only noticing it on one side
I I feel like when um
I feel like when
Republicans complain about something
they might be exaggerating it
would that be fair because in politics
everybody exaggerates everything
so probably some exaggeration
but do the Republicans fight imaginary
problems
is that a thing
and well I guess they do
yeah I guess they do if it's if it's
based on a conspiracy theory
but if it's not based on a conspiracy
theory
like it's just the news
do Republicans hallucinate just ordinary
news
it feels like there's a difference
all right here's another story
uh oh I like this quote by H.L Menken I
saw Nathaniel uh Eliason Eliason tweeted
this the whole this is a quote the whole
aim of practical politics is to keep the
populace alarmed and hence clamorous to
be led to safety by menacing it with
endless series of hobgoblins all of them
imaginary
that feels that feels like politics
right that all of our problems that are
surfaced it's not all of our problems
but the ones that are surfaced in
politics are imaginary
it's an imaginary threat from over there
we'd better attack them
probably true
pretty imaginary
all right uh this is a surprise in the
news China brokered a deal between Saudi
Arabia and Iran
to uh reopen diplomatic connections but
that's not the big part
the big part is they they broke it at an
end to the Yemen Civil War
or not an end to it but that Iran would
stop backing the uh hoodie Rebels that
were attacking Saudi Arabia
that's like a big deal isn't it
that that uh Saudi Arabian Iran can talk
again and the reason they can talk is
that China helped him solve a war
I mean I I hate to say good job China
but that was a good job and I think that
China probably used their economic clout
on both countries right because Iran
needs to sell to China I assume the
Saudis do
right so that was just good work
it's weird I mean I want to say
something bad about it but it looks like
good work
to me
and I don't know if Iran is more or less
dangerous if they get along with Saudi
Arabia
but maybe less
Maybe
now I suppose we could argue oh we need
Saudi Arabia to be tough on Iran with us
but it's also possible that Iran has
decided that you know being adventurous
is not working for them it's possible so
I guess it's too early in the story to
know if this is good or bad but I'm
going to give tried and credit got to
give China credit nobody's a bigger
critic but that looked like a smart and
just a business thing to do now the one
thing that I'm always impressed about
Saudi Arabia
especially with their new leader when
he's not cutting up people with a bone
saw
he seems to be a real practical business
person you know the Crown Prince of
Saudi Arabia it seems like he's a
negotiator a deal maker
you know you could criticism for all the
criticize him for all the other things
that you don't like that's fine but he
does seem to be a deal maker
so that that's a positive thing
all right well that ladies and gentlemen
is all I needed to say today but I said
uh to remind me something about equity
um
okay
here it is
you ready for this
um
when black Americans
focused on sports
let's say when it was finally uh it was
finally allowed that black athletes
could fully complete would you agree
that they ended up dominating Sports
maybe not every sport
but you know some of our major sports
I would say so as as a percentage of the
population I would say they dominated
when
uh Black Americans invented hip-hop
wouldn't you agree that at least for
young people
it's the dominant form of music
so they focus on music and they
dominated
would you agree that black people are
more fashionable than white people
I'm not even going to listen to your
answer the answer is yes
yes
yes like like you play this game go out
in public if you're a generic white guy
in khakis right like play this game walk
around in public where there's a mix of
people and find any black guy who is
dressed less fashionably than you are
good luck good luck I mean it might be a
tie in some cases but
yeah yeah now
but the big problem is that you don't
see a black America making as much money
right and some of that is lack of access
to education Etc
a systemic racism blah blah blah but
here's what I also uh I can't help but
notice
it's also not a focus
am I wrong
am I wrong to say that uh Black America
I lost the connection on locals locals
feed just died
huh
I might have to
quit it and restart it
looks like it's dead
see what happens if I
do this
uh
I don't know let's see if I can fix a
little technical problem here there's
probably so much traffic on locals I I'm
driving a lot of traffic to locals
all right I don't know if they can see I
can't see their comments
so it might be just a common problem
all right so to finish my points Black
America focused on Sports when they were
allowed to fully participate they
dominated focus on music dominate focus
on fashion dominate
do they focus on making money
um in in the normal Economy Way and
going to college
I don't see it do you
so here's my question
why don't black Americans understand
that every time they focused on
something they dominated
if Black America took my advice which it
won't
on how to uh how to succeed I'm
basically just a normal toolkit that
everybody uses when they succeed nothing
special for black or white people it's
just the basics of how anybody succeeds
if Black America focused on the basics
of how to succeed
they would dominate
business
they would Dominate and the reason is
that the white people aren't doing that
now white people get like more
accidental exposure to the techniques
because they're more successful people
in their Community
statistically but
there's some kind of weird assumption
that you know systemic racism is holding
Black America back and of course it is
that that's a fact but how much
how much because didn't wasn't there
systemic racism and all the things I
mentioned was there not the systemic
racism in sports even when it was legal
for everybody to participate there must
have been a ton it must have been a ton
of it and they dominated
fashion music Still dominated
so why
why do you imagine that focusing on
something else tools for Success would
not make them dominate the economy as
well
now here's now here's the thing that if
you want to go racist you could say oh
you know Steve Jobs was white and Bill
Gates was white and so you know the the
big billionaire successful people blah
blah blah well I'm you're not one of
those
you're not one of those most people are
just normal people with jobs
in in the real world of normal people
with jobs you know 99 of the world and
the job would be small business as well
um
people aren't that different
right
I know I'm I'm different from Elon Musk
and Bill Gates and Steve Steve Jobs like
I I see them operating on a level that I
can barely understand
but normal people
with normal educations
and normal access to skills
some will do better if they're trained
to do the right things than the people
who weren't trained Black America is
shooting low
if you if you say do you know any white
family that says go out there and try to
be equitable
Scott I like I'd like you to work hard
and if you do a good job you could be
average
my mother literally told me I don't care
what you do just do it better than other
people
like literally all the time
doesn't matter what you do you know you
have to follow your
follow your own dreams so I don't care
why you do but you have to do it better
than other people that's the whole game
now
who tells that to black young kids
all right you're going to be in an
economy
I don't care what you do it should be
legal I don't care what you do but you
got to do it better than other people
and now Black America is being taught to
try to be average
when every time they focus they've
dominated
I'm not wrong
nobody's nobody's disagreeing with me
people who Focus get what they want
right you can see it within one person's
job it's you know forget about a
population of people any one person if
they focus on one area
they exceed
they they will do better than the people
who didn't focus on that area at the
same time they'll do less good in the
areas they're not focusing on very
normal thing
now let me talk to Zephyr so Zephyr says
you're delusional Scott are you
disagreeing that focus is important to
success is that the point you're
disagreeing with
or do you believe that it's not enough
you think it's reaching
see I think you have to you have to live
with this idea for a little bit
because it is it's so far outside the
box
it's a reframe right so the reframe is
that that which you focused on
you succeeded do you think there were
any black people who went into sports
again thinking about the time when you
know the the rights were just being
you know equalized do you think there
are any black people went into sports
and says said I'm going to practice hard
and try to be an average player
or did they all say I think I think I
have a practice art I could be one of
the best and then they were
and do you think when yay got into
fashion just to pick a specific do you
think yay got into fashion because he
wanted to be just average
I think I could be the average of other
designers clearly not
clearly he got into the business to
dominate
and except for his other issues he would
have
so Focus works everywhere as soon as you
say yes yes but what about those weird
you know Geniuses we're not them
they're they're just not part of our
equation right the weird Geniuses are
always going to be here and doing their
weird genius thing
but normal people it's all about what
you focus on
it's all about what you focus on
and I don't see any focus in Black
America on training the Next Generation
to be good in business
and to learn the tools of success
so what do you predict about the future
well I would predict it would be exactly
what you think
they'll dominate in sports
dominate in fashion dominated music and
lose in economics every time
they're going to lose in economics every
time because there's no Focus now if you
asked anybody I'm sure I'm sure they say
yes yes making money is very important
we talk about it all the time not really
not really
I mean if you're talking about it and
you're not researching all the ways to
do it you're not you know it's not like
your your main thing that's just talk
ing about it is not focus that's not
focus and when you do talk about it do
you talk about winning or equity
if you're talking about Equity that's
not that's nothing
if you talk about winning
I could help you do it
all right
uh
uh what
who runs the media
how's that matter
all right
um
yeah so
so somebody whenever I bring up this
conversation somebody wants to bring up
the bell curve
the trouble is that's your
that feels like a
your little safe Zone
like if you want to retreat to a safe
space
if you want to talk about it
with any kind of depth
the the weirdos that are skewing the IQ
stuff they're just not part of the
conversation
the the fact that um that Bill Gates is
also white doesn't help your IQ at all
Bill Gates having a high IQ didn't help
you at all
there's no connection he's a different
person from you the fact that he's also
white doesn't help you you're not
connected
so if if in fact it's true
I don't know if it is but if some group
has a bunch of weirdos that are skewing
the Curve
there's not enough of them that they
need to be part of the conversation the
average person
does great if they do the normal things
that people do to succeed
they have a good life right we're not
we're not all becoming billionaires so
as soon as you think that that average
whatever average you think is in the
bell curve you're going to get a whole
bunch of
you know unfortunately uh black citizens
who are just getting destroyed by the
culture that they were born into right
systemic racism the center of poverty so
you could have people who are you know
not eating as well that affects your
performance not caring as much that
affects your performance you know so so
you're going to get weirdos on the
extreme lefts
who are probably has more to do with
society and then you get the weirdos on
the far let's say the high end of the
Curve
but just ignore both of them
just ignore both of them Ted just take
out of the equation the the weird
Geniuses they're not you
and then just take into consideration
that if there's more poverty in one
group they should score less that's the
most predictable thing you could imagine
poverty equals
lower grades no matter what your native
IQ is you're going to get a lower IQ
score
so
you need to you need to rise up to that
level of complexity before you have a
ticket to the conversation right if
you're stuck on the bell curve you're
just hiding in a safe space
you're just sort of ignoring the
question
the real question is most people are
normal and average and about the same
and if they use good technique they do
well
and you should treat the you know the
the low end of everything as as a
separate idea and it's not about race
and the high end are just we're lucky
that we have some freaks
I mean how lucky is it that there are
geniuses but if it's not you it's not
relevant to you
uh
well so
my mother was valedictorian my sister
was valedictorian and we were always low
income well
that's not too far from my family
situation and
uh I grew up in a small town
was it a small town
I'll bet it was but it wasn't an inner
city just guessing
all right uh
I've got some old stale Bagels I have to
go eat
and uh I think this was the most useful
live stream
that anybody will do today
Booker says Scott denies the existence
of black geniuses no actually opposite
Booker
I consider uh Kanye a genius
I consider
Michael Jordan a genius
and you know there are plenty of you
know stem people Etc so there's plenty
of brilliant people and everything but I
don't limit IQ to
um
you know math and reading
I I take the bigger picture that there
is you know there's a artistic genius
there's a physical genius
um you know musical genius
you know if somebody can do fashion
better than you and I can and they can
consistently do it that's genius prince
prince is genius
yeah
um
yep the the point Booker was uh and I'm
glad you called me on that because I was
unclear the point was not that only
white people are high in Q I wasn't
making that point I was saying that if
it's true that there's a higher
concentration of them that doesn't tell
you anything
it's just not useful
it might be true
but
it's not a useful thing it's just a
thing that exists
now
um I also wondered
do you get do you get more
um Geniuses when you have more mixture
of ethnicities
does that happen
does anybody ever study that
don't you ever wonder
like if you just took two random any any
ethnicities and mixed them and let's say
you did that a number of times and
compared to any group that's been the
same for a longer period of time
well here's what I'm saying I think you
would get more variability wouldn't you
is that true or not true
would you get more variability both on
the high end and the low end if you
mated two people who were more different
than alike
sure now
just a question
obviously it doesn't explain everything
everybody's an individual every every
group has exceptions there's no no thing
about the average that's true for any
person so I'm hoping everybody watching
this knows all the obvious stuff right
you all know that averages don't talk
about any person
and by the way here's the frame I put on
Do You discriminate against people
individually
here's the best frame on that if
somebody says do you discriminate
about one specific person because of
their ethnicity the correct answer is
this this isn't a race question
it's not a race question it's a success
question
if you close yourself off
from 90 of the world because they don't
look like you
you're going to have fewer Network
contacts you're going to meet fewer
awesome people you'll be denying
yourself the you know the Beauty and the
talents of 90 of the world
from a success perspective which is the
better frame
it doesn't make sense
it does not make sense to judge people
by immutable characteristics like you
know skin color because you're cutting
yourself off
from the potential of valuable resources
you know that they is somebody who could
do you a favor someday somebody who
knows somebody they can introduce you to
somebody who can hire you someday
somebody you can hire someday
as soon as you think that's a race
question
I I question your
um your understanding of success you
should always look at the statistics
which is what got me in trouble by the
way but that's that's the case where the
statistics say don't discriminate
that's not in your best interest you're
just you're reducing your numerical
chances of success
so I could never be in favor of that it
doesn't
lots of times we think things are about
race when it's really about stupidity
that that would just be stupid
right in 2023 If you deny your
relationship with somebody because of
their race or religion or gender or
whatever it is
all you did is reduce the number of
options you had
for a better life
who is such is there anybody left in the
world who is such a racist that they
would say I cannot possibly judge let's
say some gay individual
on anything other than their gay
like is that a thing still in 2023
I'm pretty sure that even people who you
would consider like you know the most
bigoted people
still sort of judge people individually
because it's in their best interest
I've never met an exception to that
yeah no not the gay race
yeah
all right so that's your uh reframe for
today YouTube I'm gonna say see you
later and thanks for joining
bye for now remember to set your clocks
set your clocks tonight
