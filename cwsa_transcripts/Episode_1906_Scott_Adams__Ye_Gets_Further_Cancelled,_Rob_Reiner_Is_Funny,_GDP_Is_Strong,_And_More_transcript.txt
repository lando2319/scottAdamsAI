ladies and gentlemen
in non-binaries and every other category
of human being including space aliens is
the best day you've ever experienced in
your life because you're
experiencing coffee with Scott Adams now
there are some people in Far Away worlds
who will not receive this signal from
Earth
possibly for light years
and we feel sorry for them because you
get to see it now they have to wait but
if you'd like to take it up a notch
and get a little selfish and why not all
you need is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker Chelsea signed the canteen drug
with Alaska vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope of being here the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous but it
happens now go
are you ready for the optimistic morning
that you've been craving not my usual
the world is ending morning are you
ready for the biggest dose of optimism
you've ever had in your life
here it comes
here it comes
some of you have been uh and I
appreciate it very concerned about me
because I've said that I was in great
pain
every day muscle aches and could barely
walk up the stairs
and I said to you that if this lasted I
was going to check out
meaning I didn't want to live in that
much pain
but I also told you and this is a
pretty good advice
I would never do anything in less than a
year
I would always give myself a year
to work it out right no matter how bad
it was no matter how much pain I was in
I could make it last a year you know
just to see if I could solve it
and I saw um
was at Matthew McConaughey or I saw
somebody's
father gave them advice I think it was
Matthew McConaughey telling a story
about his father giving his advice
and it was some of the best advice I've
ever seen in my life and I've actually
tried to incorporate it and it's
immediately useful and it's a I guess
you could call it a reframe
and here it is
do one more
that's it that's the whole advice
you can do one more
you would be amazed how often that
little bit of advice
changes everything
I I tried it out at the gym
so normally when I go to the gym I lift
until you know sometimes I'm counting I
know I should but usually I don't I stop
when my arm is tired
[Laughter]
and then I try I I said to myself
what I would normally would stop I'd say
all right could you do one more
and the answer is almost always you can
you can almost always do one more
and
it's amazing how a motivational that is
anyway
back to me
so for the last several months I've been
in pretty much you know discomfort and
it's gotten worse to the point where
um I have to admit and I don't want to
be banned from YouTube for saying things
that would be controversial so I'm going
to try to say it as medically as I can
all right
uh I was overwhelmed with suicidal
thoughts
for the last several weeks
like it's kind of all I thought about
honestly I didn't go a minute without
thinking about it now I was never close
as in I never made a plan you know never
thought I'll I'll put together my
concept for doing it or anything like
that it's just that I couldn't get out
of my mind
because my life was not up to the
quality of life
that would have made any sense to
continue
right now there's definitely an
irrational
ending of your life but there's also a
rational time to do it let's say if you
had Lou Gehrig's and you were in pain
and you only had a month to live anyway
there are rational reasons to put
yourself on the pain and I thought I was
in one
I thought it was in one so I felt
depression and I felt the pain and I
could barely walk up the stairs
do I sound better today
you can tell can you
can you tell
well whatever was bothering me yesterday
you can tell it went away right it's
obvious
do you think that I solved my problem by
taking a med
do you think that's what I did do you
think I took some Pharmaceuticals and
solved my problem in one day
no you I stopped taking
this drug
and all my problems stopped
I stopped taking this for one
day
one day
everything's better
everything
the Suicidal Thoughts
completely gone
like it doesn't even make sense like my
brain doesn't even know why I would even
have those thoughts
physical
completely fine walked five miles
yesterday half of it was up uphill
no problem
no problem at all and that was when and
that was from the day before
I was using the elevator in my own house
yes I have an elevator
because the the stairs were too much of
a challenge
true story
one day
now this was on my list if if you were
you know wondering how I solved it
and by the way it's not solved this is
blood pressure meds
so my blood pressure was high right now
so I could still die
but it won't be today
um
so once it was obvious once it was
really obvious that the meds were the
problem I Googled it
and I googled it's a beta blocker
yeah yep somebody's on it so somebody
googled this or already knows there are
two types of blood pressure meds
one kind a study showed those people
kill themselves
more often than they should
there is literally a study
saying that people will take drugs in
this class I'm not going to tell you the
specific one I'm only going to tell you
the class because I don't want to get
sued is it a class of beta blocking
blood pressure meds the other is an Ace
inhibitor I don't know what the
trade-off is
but I have the kind where there's a 2019
study saying it'll make you suicidal
the drug did this
everything you saw
of my complete personality change over
the last few weeks you all sought right
if you watch me every day you can't miss
it can you you saw
you saw my personality change didn't you
it was a it was this little
thing
can you believe that
like it was that simple
now it's still not simple because I have
to get my blood pressure under control
one way or another
but oh my God
oh my God now keep in mind that the 2019
trial or study I guess the 2019 study
did not say
that it was you know in our randomized
controlled trial and and confirmative it
was just saying people need to look into
this
that's what most studies do so I can't
confirm that it's a problem
I can only confirm that after every
single day of feeling terrible
the one day I didn't take this I feel
great
mentally physically right not a problem
in the world
so
don't you like good news
how about some more good news for you
that was my good news and by the way
by the way
a lot of people reached out to me
because they they could see that I was
in trouble
which I was
that was real by the way and it's the
darndest feeling and thank you so let me
say as clearly as I can
thank you
thank you all right
yeah because you knew I was in trouble
now I know I was in trouble too but
here's the messed up part
when you're the one who's having the
mental trouble
you can't help yourself
right
so I had to actually like get outside of
my body
and actually become like a robot
to
to narrow it down
so I think I showed you I started with
you know all the possible things it
could be wrote them onto my whiteboard
and I just went to you know pure
analytical Scott
because analytical Scott can operate
independent from you know emotional
angry Scott
so for a while I just allowed myself to
be like an actor just act like you're
rational for a while see what that would
look like and and that that was enough
to get me out
so I was rational enough to narrow down
the things but I'll tell you the things
I couldn't do
I couldn't do things like just make a
doctor appointment that I knew I needed
to make
because the I guess the dopamine was
gone or something so the thought and the
action were disconnected for a long time
but now I feel them connected today if I
wanted to make a doctor appointment I
would just make a doctor appointment
yesterday it seemed impossible
all right
enough about me
uh I I only mentioned this because I
think it's generalizable
if you're worried about your mood check
your meds
um there's a 60-minute segment
I guess last night in which the Dominion
the makers of election products uh
there's going ahead with their lawsuit
against Fox News and apparently it looks
like they could win
I mean it sounds like they have a bit of
a case I don't know how this is going to
work out but I guess they've been
getting uh death threats and everything
else
so that's pretty horrible
but you can see now that the entire news
business
has
gotten into the business of trying to
destroy the candidate on the other side
and do you think the 60 Minutes would
have done
this story
if not for how it would influence the
political
world
it feels like a story you do because you
want to stop Trump from being president
again
doesn't it
now
I get that it's a real story like it's a
real story but the timing of it
is this not a two-year-old story
or a one-year-old when did Dominion
first Sue
this is like old news right but they
waited until you're pretty close to the
midterms to give it a little extra juice
yeah so to me this looks like
um
well let me put this a a different and
maybe more productive way
this looks like something that CNN would
not do under their current leadership
but Anderson Cooper and his other job at
60 minutes
CBS CBS did it
now would you agree that this is
something the CNN would have done in
their past
formation but maybe they would be less
inclined to do today
I like to give CNN credit
I'd like to give them credit for what
seems to be
from the outside a genuine turn toward
being useful
now they're doing it for business
reasons and their own reasons but I feel
like I feel like there's something that
looks successful about that
I've got a new tell for cognitive
dissonance
now this is when you've trapped somebody
in their argument
and and they say blah blah blah and then
that's your tell that there's there's no
point in discussing it any further
they've gone into irrational land
and I'll give you one
when you see how
um
how cognitive dissonance works
you can spot it in the wild where before
you just thought there was something
unexplained like you didn't understand
why somebody was acting the way they
were but it is so
so useful for explaining why people are
acting irrational I give you this the
specific example from
earlier today somebody tweeted something
with an analogy in it and the analogy
was comparing Evolution you know the
biological evolution
to people working in a project which
they run as a
self-organizing project in other words
yeah there's some commonality between
those so I was asked to comment on this
and I pointed out that all I saw was a
bad analogy
because the point was being made about
comparing these two things biological
evolution
and people in let's say a workplace or
an organization using a self-organizing
kind of a process or something
and basically as soon as I see an
analogy I bow out
now the comment from the Tweeter whose
name isn't important for this purpose he
said that wasn't an analogy I was
describing the system
now he was describing a system obviously
but he was also doing it in the context
of an analogy so what he said he was it
wasn't an analogy
I tweeted back what the analogy was I
said you said evolution
is like this process in in the
organization
now shouldn't that be the end of the
conversation
I say you used an analogy person who
used it says no I didn't
and then I use their tweet from like one
tweet ago like a brand new tweet from
one tweet a guy and go you said this
there's an analogy for this
now what are the appropriate responses
to that
the non-cognitive dissonance responses
would be oh I can see why you thought
that was an analogy but maybe I was
using it differently maybe or maybe you
say
um oh yes I was an analogy but I'm only
trying to make one narrow point about it
perfectly acceptable
or you could say
all kinds of things you can imagine all
kinds of rational things you could say
in response
maybe you might even say it's a good
point
but instead
uh I was accused of not being able to
admit when I'm wrong
not being able to so I was accused of
not being able to admit when I'm wrong
I just printed
you you now analogized this to this
what
now for a while
because I get this a lot I get the you
don't you don't admit when you're wrong
but
I've only recently realized that I only
get it when I'm definitely right
and the other person sees it too
it's the only time people say that to me
what is really really obvious I'm right
when when that's not the case they don't
say that
because people will argue their point if
they have a point
right see that's how you know cognitive
dissonance if somebody has a good
argument they'll always use it
who doesn't use their good argument
everybody does
but if they go to you don't admit when
you're wrong well
cognitive disease
um
interestingly
the GDP numbers for America that are
supposed to be coming out for the United
States
are supposed to be strong
like we don't have the numbers yet but
apparently the gross domestic product
looks pretty strong it's going to be
over two percent which in this
environment would be surprisingly good
and at the same time
um
consumers spending is strong
despite inflation or maybe because of it
I suppose
um
so that's not really surprising and also
employment stays strong employment is
great
now
and do we believe that there's some
movement on deficit spending because I
know Biden's you know lying about how
much he's bringing down the deficit but
it's moving in the right direction isn't
it I think it would have to be because
we're not doing well wait how could it
be we're spending so much on Ukraine how
could it be
I don't know so I guess I don't
understand what's happening with the
national debt
because reporting is so bad about that
but
remember I told you a while ago that the
one metric you should put most of your
attention in is
let's see if you remember what did I say
is one economic metric that you should
watch above all others
it's the one you can depend on
in the long run
employment yeah if your employment goes
down
you're kind of screwed
you're kind of screwed but if if
employment stays high you can pretty
much get through everything
pretty much everything
now that's an exaggeration you could
imagine something would crumble the
system but you're in a strong position
if you've got strong employment
as of today
let me ask you what this sounds like to
you
see if this sounds like
what it sounds like to me
as of today CNN reported well an opinion
piece but in the opinion piece it was
that smart people are now saying we're
definitely going to have a recession
but it'll be in 2023. like it's it's not
happening yet we're pushing it down a
little bit definitely still having the
recession but further than we thought
what does that sound like
that sounds like no recession
or or a tiny one
every time they say that the recession
is further in our future it makes me
think it's not going to happen
now I told you I'm going to give you the
optimistic View today right do you mind
so on this one don't fight me too much
because we're only here to feel good we
don't know what's going to happen
but I will tell you again that that
strong Employment Number that just keeps
holding that just keeps holding as long
as that holds
you'll be fine
you'll be fine
now remember the biggest part of the
um
the economy aside from physical access
to resources which is a challenge right
now is the psychology
so if you know that the high high
employment numbers which are good
indicates we'll be good in the long run
then you have a strong enough psychology
do survive for the long run so we do
have in place
the primary pillars for climbing out of
this it's in place and then on top of
that you've got the Adam's law of
slow-moving disasters
in which when you can see a specific
problem from long enough away
we always rise to the challenge it's
only the surprises that catch us off
guard but when we see a coming from a
long ways away
I would argue that Ukraine might be one
of those situations
although you know the problem's pretty
bad but in terms of arming Ukraine
I feel like we must have had enough
warning in advance that Russia might
invade that we got them enough stuff
quickly enough
that it made a big difference so I think
that was the case of the Adam's law of
slow-moving disasters arguably it
created a different kind of disaster
because nothing's going well
all right
um
we saw some numbers it says the s.a.t
school SAT and ACT composite scores
improved
in west coast states
for every racial demographic but scores
in the South and non-coastal West went
down
so how do you explain this this will be
a little test I have the answer for you
but I'll give you the answer in a moment
but how would you guess why would it be
that
California
um in particular
every every group did better on sats and
acts
do you know why
well one person who tweeted at me today
said that uh California dropped its sat
requirements for state colleges
which means that everyone who thought
they wouldn't do well didn't take them
[Laughter]
so you can't compare California to
anything else and California would skew
the whole West Coast so the West Coast
numbers are just because half
of the people who would have scored
poorly just didn't take them because
they didn't need to because they could
get into college without them
so it might be bad for the standards of
the colleges but it's good for those
people who got in
all right
um however
would you be surprised that not having
school for a year was bad for learning
uh below the college level
no you would not be surprised
they did a sweeping analysis of test
scores since the start of the pandemic
and there's a nationwide Plunge in math
and reading more math than reading went
down
uh
are you surprised that not having real
schools made a difference
do not
you know I'll tell you
the Republicans have only one obstacle
to winning the presidency and everything
else do you know what that is
what is the one obstacle that the
Republicans have to owning Congress and
the presidency
oh my God nobody has this
no all right one one person got it I
think a few people got it the answer is
Trump
if you took Trump out of the mix
you're guaranteed to win you know if you
run just a mainstream
Republican who just wants to do
trump-like things but without the
provocation
yeah but I don't think Republicans can
can make that happen
now to be fair
to be fair the only reason a non-trump
republican would be sure to win would be
give me the answer why could we be sure
that a non-trump republican would win
because of Trump trump created a
situation in which there are very clear
trump-like Republican uh policy
preferences
that you know are largely Republican
anyway but anybody who adopted those
same stances would just walk into the
job because he he created a right and
wrong way to be
and now somebody just needs to adopt it
without being Trump and it's it's the
golden it's the golden bridge to
anything they want
uh
uh how about running Lara Trump
Lara Trump is a strong
strong player
like I I don't know if she has any
political Ambitions at the moment but
she would be pretty strong candidate she
has all the she has all the skills she's
everything from the look
to the you know the hard work ethic I
follow her on Instagram
for the for her exercise routines have
you ever seen the Lara Trump's uh
Instagram she she does most of her
photos are from the gym or with the kids
and her gym workout is so impressive
like it it makes me tired just looking
at it like there's somebody who's really
like a go-getter personality you see why
she married into the Trump family she
seems to be a perfect fit
um
so uh there's a lawsuit in Missouri that
might turn into a big thing alleging
that the government used big tech for
censorship
and apparently there's plenty of
evidence of that
plenty of evidence of the Democrats
talking directly to the big social media
platforms and asking them to among other
things to ban Alex Berenson
who got put back on Twitter and then
said some things that got him banned
again
I think getting banned on Twitter is his
primary career uh strategy that it's
working
um
so let's uh here's a little quote from
Rob Ryder's favorite politician Joe
Biden and I'm going to read this quote
exactly as he said it he was asked if
his age is getting to him and Biden said
and I quote
am I slowing up
am I don't have the same pace
you know uh in that old joke uh you know
uh everybody talks about the you know
the uh the 70s 50. you know all that
stuff you know I uh you know
could be
uh I could get a disease tomorrow I I
could you know drop dead tomorrow
it's well said well said Joe Biden
I don't think I could have said that any
better
um
now what does uh Rob Ryder think about
that he says in the Tweet if you don't
vote blue we will lose our
constitutional democracy
um
to which I say
if you don't vote blue you lose your
constitutional democracy
how many things can I find wrong with
that statement number one
we're not a constitutional
democracy were Republic
is that the same
yeah we're Republic seems like that
should be important
um although I don't know what the
difference would be between a
constitutional democracy
would that be direct vote for everything
by definition
that's the definition right I don't know
so he doesn't know what system he lives
in but he doesn't want to lose the
system that is not the system he lives
in so good start for a tweet and
um if you don't vote blue
you lose your constitutional democracy
so the idea would be that I guess the
Republicans he believes do not respect
the Constitution
um has he ever met a Republican
the only thing the Republicans like is
the Constitution and the Bible I suppose
their families but
uh this is sort of as close as you can
get to the opposite of what your enemy
is
like I get that people you know assign
names to their enemies but it's so weird
when they try to label them as the exact
opposite of everything they are
now I'm not saying that they're
succeeding that's a different argument
I'm not saying that being a republican
is better than being a Democrat that's a
different argument
I'm just saying that the entire brand of
the Republicans is can we please follow
the Constitution and make sure the
elections were valid
and that turned into were a bunch of
anarchists trying to overthrow the
country for our fascist ways
so that's that's what he thinks
um
if you were going to correctly criticize
the GOP or the Democrats what would that
look like
because right now we just call the
Democrats a bunch of
Communists and socialists and they call
the Republicans a bunch of fascists and
Nazis and vice versa but if you were
actually going to be serious about your
criticisms what could they say about the
GOP
they could complain about abortion
they they have a very different opinion
there
um
they can complain about the government
telling you how to raise your kids
interestingly
have you noticed that Republicans are
generally on the side of keep the
government out of our business
except when it comes to the trans rights
stuff and then they want the government
in the business really hard have you
noticed that
that that's one of the reasons I'm not
I'm not wading in deeply into the trans
argument
it's because the Republicans are
requiring the government to tell the
parents what to do
the well no not only for kids
you you want correct me if I'm wrong but
Republicans want the government
to tell parents how to raise their kids
is that not right
I thought that's the whole argument I'm
seeing those so reframe that in the way
that you would put it
I I would think that the way you think
about it is protecting children right
the way you think about it is protecting
children
is that right
but in order to protect children do you
not have to uh
overrule their own parents in the case
of the trans surgeries
and again I'm not I'm not pro-trans
surgeries
I'm not giving you an opinion on it I'm
just asking for a clarification I'm
saying only knows but I want to see your
argument
I realize it's just Twitter comments and
stuff so it's hard to put an open
it's about the age of consent no it's
not
it's not about the age of consent
because it's about the parents
see if if you were saying the government
should control directly the children
that's a different argument that's not
the argument being made the argument is
that the government should control the
adults
so that the adults don't raise their
kids the way they want to
am I wrong
now let me ask you this would you like
that argument used on you
let's say that somebody does a study
someday and finds out that if you teach
your child to believe the Bible is
literally true
that they'll have a bad time in life
it'll it'll be like a disadvantage for
them
and then the government says all right
you can't teach your children that
because there's a study that says it's
bad for him you're on board with that
because they would because in that case
they would be trying to stop child abuse
as they see it
because it's the as they see it partly
you can't get past can you
now let me say that I completely
understand the argument
of stopping trans surgeries on minors I
completely understand that it's easy to
understand right
you don't have to convince me
completely understand but there's no
stopping the fact
that you took the decision away from the
parents
that's just a fact
so if you're okay with that then that's
a then you have a consistent point of
view but you have to know that that
could come back and bite you right
that's going to come back to you if you
were successful in overruling the
parents that will come back to you
somebody says worth it it might be it
might be but you don't know what's going
to come back
if what comes back to you is worse
no I'm not trolling yeah you might be
new here
so those of those of you who know me
better and have been on this live stream
longer
you know what I do
all right number one I'm not trying to
change your mind on this topic because I
don't have an idea what the the best
answer is I really don't because I think
you have two absolutes
that I can't deal with
right one absolute is
the absolute of protecting children if
you can do anything to do it you should
do it that's an absolute
right because you're human forget about
the law it doesn't matter what the law
says you're a human being
protecting children is going to be like
right at the top of your list
but right at the top of your list also
is keeping the government out of your
family decisions
those two things are
in inviolable rules in my mind
so to me you have two Impossibles
and picking one of those Impossibles
you have to
you have to because you live in the real
world so you've got to make choices
I actually don't know what's right
because because here's the problem
I'm convinced there's some percentage of
those children who have the surgery when
they're minors
grow up thinking that they're happy they
did it early
now you might say but they think they're
happy but they're not
I said some percentage some percentage
it might be five percent
I don't know what the percentages it
might be five percent it might be ten
percent
and and you could argue that that's a
good enough reason you could say well if
it is 10 and I'm just throwing in a
number I have no idea if it's 90 or 10
percent
but people do convince themselves that
they made the right decision it's
cognitive dissonance again right
some number of people hold on here this
will make you feel better some number of
people
if they were a party to the decision
themselves let's say a kid who was you
know really wanted the surgery and
parents agreed
that kid in theory even if it even if
that were a bad decision
that kids should grow up to think it was
a good decision would you agree
because once you've committed yourself
to the decision it's far more likely
that your brain will convince you that
it was a good decision over time because
that's how brains work independent of
this I'm saying any decision forget
about trans any important decision you
make no matter how good or bad you're
very likely to convince yourself later
that it was good
now
here's the exception to that
when it involves something as deep as
your sexuality I think your sexuality is
probably going to Bubble Up
like it doesn't matter how much
cognitive dissonance you're experiencing
that's probably the one thing that can
cut through it over time right like if
you're seriously gay
your your biology is going to be tapping
at the shoulder for as many years as it
takes for you to say all right I'm
finally okay
so I think
I think this is an impossible situation
the the whole trans surgery thing is is
impossible
but if you said to yourself I'm sure
there are far more people who are
injured
they're not
and protecting children is higher than
maybe even the Constitution
maybe even the Constitution I wouldn't
argue that
so let me let me be as clear as possible
I am not a disagreeing or disavowing any
of your opinions on this topic
and that's different than a lot of
topics typically I'm quite willing to
say your ideas bad and mine is a little
bit better
I mean you've seen that a million times
but on this one on this one now
and this one you're on your own because
there's no right answer here and if you
take the greater benefit the kids can
wait make the decision later that's
reasonable
that's reasonable
I don't I don't know if it's right but
it's reasonable
and then you got to bring it down to
circumcision and it gets it's it's ugly
all right um
have you noticed that uh when Democrats
insult Republicans
uh they like to point out that neo-nazis
are often uh right leaning
so they try to ruin the Republican brand
by saying you know that's what the
neo-nazis are they also vote you know
conservative
uh so that's what the Democrats say
about Republicans and what do the
Republicans say to insult
Democrats
they say that Rob Reiner is a Democrat
so I'm so here here we've got the
balance so Republicans say that
Democrats say the Republicans are
neo-nazis
and that Republicans say that Democrats
are like Rob Reiner I'm going to score
that a tie
roughly roughly a tie
um
I saw somebody refer to Rob Reiner
George Takei and John Cusack as the
Democrats Three Stooges
Three Stooges
and and then this made me uh Wonder
um
so every now and then you see people
move from one party to the other right
so so you've seen a number of notable
people who used to be one thing and then
they moved to the other party
and I think this is probably just in my
mind
but I'm noticing a pattern
right
I feel like the pattern is that when
somebody moves from Democrat to
Republican
they tend to be let's say an ex-member
of Congress
or a billionaire
or an entrepreneur or an investor like a
famous investor
but
exactly moves from Republican to
Democrat
Steve Schmidt
Rick Wilson
do you see a pattern
like am I I'm not sure like I think I
maybe have selective memory
right that Liz chady right so kinziger
so does this seem to me that there's a
certain type of person who's moving one
way and a different type of person who's
who's moving that way
am I right
it seems like the the lightweight people
are moving Democrat and the heavyweight
people are moving Republican
by heavyweight I would say someone who's
been in Congress right
that that's pretty serious person
somebody who's already a billionaire
from their own work
that's a serious person
and you know Venture capitalists Etc all
right
um I don't know I I'm probably wrong
that that's a correlation
but it looks like one
I saw a video of a 1943 communist
directive
in which
first of all it has wonderful old time
talk
do you know old-timey talk
if you see any video or audio from the
40s
all the men talk like this whatever
they're on video they they seem to talk
in a way that is only common to people
who are talking on video in the 40s why
is it that to be all on the video in the
40s would talk like this
but today nobody talks like this because
they did in the 40s but they do not
anymore
is there some reason why people talk
like that before
and they don't talk like that now were
they all imitating
you know somebody the radio voice or
something yeah maybe they were imitating
radio voice on video oh that's a good
theory
that's a good theory they were imitating
radio voice
when video was still young
oh my God I think you answered the
question I've wondered about that all of
my life
and that probably is the answer right
yeah
because when you're on radio you're
acting with your voice
when you're on video you're trying to be
like more of a whole person oh that
makes sense
huh
I want you to uh
listen to this if I can find it quickly
oh here it is it's in the United States
in red
in 1943 the following directive was
issued from party headquarters to all
Communists in the United States to all
communities
when certain obstructionists become too
irritating label them after suitable
buildups as fascist or Nazi or
anti-Semitic and use the prestige of
anti-fascist intolerance organizations
to discredit
in the public mind constantly associate
those who oppose us with those names
which already have a bad smell
the association will after enough
repetition become
fact in the public mind in 1943 the
following so
um
repetition
and Association repetition and
Association those are the two uh maybe
two of the strongest parts of hypnosis
and persuasion repetition and
Association and in 1943
Communists were taught to
um label anybody who is against them as
a fascist or Nazis and to associate with
more credible organizations that would
also you know have those accusations
does that sound like uh 2020 through
2022
it's exactly it's exactly so the the
1943 communist Playbook is being rolled
out
here right now
and and the thing is it's working
yeah the thing is it works this was
actually a really good advice
for bad behavior
all right
um
you know the other day when I was
mocking the Democrats for saying that
cost reductions were reducing inflation
when those are just completely different
concepts you know one is about the value
of your money and the other is about
just what did something cost today
um you know they're they they have some
connection but they're different
concepts and Nancy Pelosi uh on a video
interview said on the news quote what I
hear people talk about inflation we have
to change that subject
now that's being taken out of context
to make it look like she just doesn't
want to talk about inflation because
it's bad
what she says is inflation is global
what we should be talking about is ways
we can lower your expenses in other
words your health care expense
immediately or your whatever expense
and do you think that
I I'm kind of
um Scott's finally waking up I'm kind of
surprised that she made that distinction
because I think it was working for them
to conflate the cost reductions with the
inflation because Biden was doing it and
I think it worked because correct me if
I'm wrong but I'm literally the only
person who told you they were doing that
am I right have you heard one other
person in any news or any other place
tell you they were knowingly conflating
cost reductions and inflation
I think I'm the only one
and then Nancy Pelosi is saying it
directly that that the the Democrats
were actually conflating them and she
says they shouldn't
now
I don't know if she improved the
argument
I I think that her argument is more
accurate so I'll give her credit
that's she's more accurate uh oh
somebody says Ben Shapiro pointed out
the difference between inflation and
cost reduction which makes sense
I would imagine you would
all right so uh next topic
so it looks I was really interested to
see if uh the performer formerly known
as Kanye now yay I was really interested
to see if he could be canceled
because I was starting to think he might
be uncancelable but I think they've done
it
and it looks like you know there's more
movement toward everybody canceling it
um and I think even his old
even his own uh
agent I think his own agent or somebody
he worked with Ari
um it wants to cancel
so basically all of Hollywood and
anybody who's associated with or
supportive of the Jewish Community is
pretty much joined forces and and he's
canceled
he's canceled
so
but here's do you want to hear a good uh
conspiracy theory
all right this is not mine so this was
suggested to me
on uh you know on a message
so I always say he was suggested uh in
case they don't want their name known
but
the idea is that Kanye already said
before any of this
ugliness happened he had said that he
wanted to get out of his deals with uh
Gap and Adidas
I can't think of a better way to get out
of your deals
now the question is could he possibly
have done this intentionally
to cancel the deals he wanted to cancel
that couldn't have been canceled any
other way probably
is he that smart
I don't know
I don't know I don't see anybody
branding themselves as anti-Semitic
to cancel a deal
that feels like something that literally
nobody would do
[Laughter]
but maybe you know the reason that uh
yay is yay and and I'm not
is because he does things that I
wouldn't do right the the very fact that
the thing that made of him
and the reason we talk about him is he
doesn't do what you and I would do so
who knows who knows I doubt it doesn't
seem like a good play it doesn't sound
like a smart play so I don't think so
but it was interesting
now
if he hasn't clarified or corrected
um
what is the right
way to go on this
and I've said this before but
um
if somebody said
so here's your here's your racism uh
bigotry test okay
if somebody said to you
uh let me tell you my sixth grade
teacher when I was a kid
taught taught the class in direct
language
that Chinese people were good at
business
now that was the most racist thing
anybody ever said you know that I ever
heard in public like from a person with
authority
and I think he mentioned I'm not
positive I think he mentioned the Jewish
Community too I think he said oh yeah
you know the Chinese and and the Jews
are good at business
now
now I don't know if that's true or false
like if you were to do some kind of a
study would you find out that they had
more success than other people I don't
know I have no idea if that would test
out but you're not supposed to say it
the the only thing I'm sure of is you're
not supposed to say it
even if you're sure it's true you're not
supposed to say it
so but here's my question
have we gone so far
and are we such that we will
cancel somebody for complimenting us
that's where we are
cut Kanye's entire complaint about the
Jewish community and it's been a few
days so now that the temperatures come
down a little bit so we can talk about
it a little more objectively objectively
speaking he was really pissed at Jews
for out competing them
if somebody's out competing you
and why he's not saying here's what he's
not saying they cheated
didn't say that they broke the law
didn't say that they they colluded
together to to do something against me
you didn't exactly say that although
that one you have to wonder about
because he did talk about the group
collectively he did not say that they
were organized
but he did talk about them collectively
I think that's a clarification he ought
to fix
so
I'm seeing some disagreements let's
let's play with the disagreement
in my opinion he said that the the
Jewish people that he was dealing with
in the business world were doing a
really good job for themselves and he
wishes that black people and himself in
particular
couldn't meet that level of aggressive
business
I know attitude or success or something
and I did not hear the insult in that
did I miss it
can somebody tell me what the insult was
uh
so where is the insult
is it oh it's a compliment used to
discriminate against Jews
okay you don't feel less stretching a
little bit
uh your your point is actually makes
sense
but
that doesn't stretch it a little bit
because
here's the thing
if you're making the Hitler analogy and
it's of course it's impossible not to in
this case right if you're making the
Hitler analogy I do believe Hitler was
kind of close to that wasn't he like
didn't he say
you know they're this this group is
being too successful so we have to stop
them
but that's not what Kalia says did you
see Carney say anything about stopping
them or
I didn't see it
didn't see it at all now he did insult
Jared Kushner but that sounded personal
he painted Jews as immoral somebody says
I didn't see it
well what would give me give me like a
quote
that you think and I'm not denying it
I'm just not aware of it give me a quote
that you think
was Kanye calling them immoral because
what I heard is that he said he was
Jewish too
so that sounds like the opposite of
calling somebody immoral if he was
identifying with a group
now I I don't buy that identification
but you know it was part of his
communication
now he's not I don't think he's
technically Jewish he was saying that
black people are Jewish there's some
argument for that that I don't
understand
um
all right
uh our lopsided contracts immoral
I don't know
are they do you think yay signed a
lopsided contract
now I understand that he was unhappy
with some of his Partners about the
things he thought he was going to get
um
Black Hebrew Israelites yeah
I'm not I'm not that interested
the answer liquid Swan is no
uh in case you're interested there's a
long delay between when my ex-wife and I
decided that things were done and when
you heard about it so there was a lot of
time in between there
all right the lopsided contract
don't you think yay thinks that he would
like to be in the position to have
lopsided contracts
do you think that if yay could have any
kind of contract he wanted he would sign
one that's really fair to everybody or
one that was lopsided in his favor as
long as everybody won
like I don't think he would punish
somebody with a bad contract but I think
as long as they won and he won more you
don't think he'd sign that contract I
think he would and I think you'd he
would compliment anybody who could get
away with it
because it would just be business
yeah
yeah anyway
um it does look like the cancellation is
going to work now the only way I imagine
he could get out of it would be if he
has enough resources that he can start
his own
chain of retail stores
which I think is a possibility like you
might just start his own chain or
something or make parlor work or
something but uh he's in trouble I don't
think he anticipated this much trouble
uh I mentioned before that yay was
thinking of building a mini City that's
sort of designed after his own aesthetic
and maybe a city about all things he
likes or whatever
um
and I would like to add this I'm going
to a meeting tonight in my little my
little city where they're talking about
turning one of the roads into part
bicycles part roads if I were to design
a mini City here's how I'd start
I would put the schools in one place in
the center
so that the school system is equal
distance from everybody
and that's the most important thing
and then I would have a hub and spoke
bicycle and electric conveyance you know
like scooters and stuff only
walking and bikes there would be a hub
and spoke that would all go to the
school in the center
so that if you were on a bicycle and you
wanted to get from anywhere to anywhere
else you could go to the center and then
that would connect you to all the other
paths to wherever you want to go
so you would build it first as a
bicycle-friendly city because e-bikes
and econ conveyances will be the thing
and they will replace cars there's no
doubt about it if you've had an e-bike
experience you know
these are going to be everywhere there's
no doubt about it as soon as you touch
one you're like okay this is going to be
everywhere there's no doubt about it
and sort of like the first time you held
a smartphone
the first time you got a smartphone did
you ever think to yourself well this
will go backwards to the flip phone even
though it barely worked you knew that
was the future right when you held it in
your hand there was no doubt right and
I've told the story about the first time
I saw the internet
when it had there were two websites in
total that were public that's it the
whole internet was two websites when I
first saw and I knew
it was going to be huge you could just
tell and everybody who saw it knew the
moment they saw this is going to be
gigantic
so e-bikes are like that you don't
understand yet how big e-bikes are going
to be and the scooters and ethics it's
because the uh Battery Technology
finally reached a point where they're
they're awesome
uh
so that's how I built my city
and then
there's a story about the Israeli Air
Force bombed an Iranian drone factory
located in Syrian territory
so apparently the Iranians were shipping
the Drone parts to uh
a Syrian territory place that they had
control of and building the drones there
now
is that why Iran can say these drones
did not come from us
that's that's probably their trick right
Joe hoft did a piece on me yesterday
I suppose I should go look at that
Joe hoft or Jim hoft
I don't know which lofty you're talking
about
all right um I'll look that up
so there goes that Iranian drone Factory
what happens if uh you if Russia can't
get
um it is Jack what happens if uh
the Russians can't get Iranian drones
that's a pretty big deal isn't it in
terms of the war Direction
um
yeah lithium recycling is cracking up
fast that's true
all right I'll have to surrender
uh how many kids can you fit on an
e-bike
well they would have their own e-bike
so
uh Scott Jenny says Scott duped by
batteries and green energy thinks
everything always improves like chip
processing speed does it does that sound
does that sound like something I say
that I that I'm duped into believing
that uh
batteries and green injury uh will
improve like chip processing speed
does that does that sound like something
I said you stupid
by the way if you haven't already
noticed
um
in in personal relationships
tell me if this isn't true
one-on-one if you're talking to somebody
in person
if a woman criticizes a man
the man will hold back
true or false
if a woman criticizes a man in person
the man will hold back
of course
now not only will the man hold back
physically of course
because she's documented to create a
fight
but you will hold out you'll hold back
verbally as well will you not
true or false that a man will hold back
verbally as well because you know you
don't want the husband to cover and
punch your lights out and stuff like
that but here's the problem and correct
me if I'm wrong this is just a
hypothesis I'm developing my belief is
that women have taken that safety
to the internet
and they believe they can on me
without any pushback
and so because I like to train them that
that's not the case
as soon as they criticize me unfairly
I call them stupid guns
because I'm not going to hold back on
social media
on social media if you come after me
it's going to be 100 percent
well I might even exceed what you did
like if you come after me with a
8 out of 10 awfulness I might give you a
10. and I wouldn't feel bad about that
at all do you know why
because I'm not a sexist
that's why
because I did not grow up around weak
women
right my mother wasn't weak
my sister isn't weak
no no women in my family were weak
so if you come at me hard
I'm gonna slap you back on you
know on social media in person I would
act the same way
in person I would just suck it up
because in person you really do have to
take you you do have to take into
account there's a physicality difference
there and I would go easy on somebody
who did not have a physical you know
Equity with me like I I would just treat
them differently
but online
no no I have no filter online if you
come at me with I'm going to
come at you with everything I've got
just for fun
right and I don't even care about you
just to be clear I don't care about you
at all I just enjoyed the fact that you
gave me a free punch
and I thought oh free punch
I would love to call somebody a
piece of
right to their digital face it's fun you
should try it have you ever like just
seriously insulted somebody right to
their face while they're live
it's way more fun than you think it is
because you don't get to do it in real
life but on social media
yeah come at me
you would cry no you wouldn't
but anyway but but the basis for this I
know somebody who's going to say he's a
misogynist because he says bad things
about men
to which I say you idiot no I
call everybody the same way you've seen
me treat men on social media do I go
easy on men on social media
never
never I never go easy on them
I I just I just cursed went out this
morning
it's like a daily occurrence for me
all right uh
treat everybody the same in my side
exactly
well I don't think that's
I don't think that's
all that happened today but uh did
anything else happen today that I care
about
what's your uh
what's what's on your mind
yeah you're right I I don't reserve the
c word for women that's a generic insult
treat everyone like they know jiu jitsu
opinion on the phrase the walls are
closing in well I mean it's a it's a
punchline phrase now
so
but I do worry that we're getting too
used to the fact that the walls never do
close in
yeah there's some ABC producer that
disappeared but we don't know why
Mayo Clinic an executive health program
a one to three day physical exam
uh you got canceled by cernovich by
saying why don't men eat real protein
instead of powdered stuff
Patty got canceled by cernovich for uh
asking about
protein sources
sirovich is the best counselor on the
internet I think
somehow he's turned canceling into some
kind of like an asset or something like
he cancels so aggressively that that
it's like I've told you about addiction
right
addiction is not caused by getting what
you want
and then wanting more of it addiction is
caused by not being sure you'll get what
you want
but you get it often enough they really
craving it each time so you get addicted
but if you follow cernovich your odds of
being blocked for making a comment are
so high
that you it feels like special
I'm still here
you somehow he's managed to make his
Twitter feeds like a like a club where
he can turn you away from being ugly
it's kind of amazing to watch
um
poet Paul Joseph says where did
cernovich even come from now that
is one of the most interesting stories
in the world
because where he came from is nowhere
you should read his origin story
talk it talk about somebody who did it
himself
just by figuring it out
I mean he literally
figured it out like how how do you go
from nothing to something
and he just figured it out and then it
was really hard and then he did it
anyway
so I mean sometimes it's that easy
figure out what you need to do
it's really really hard and then do it
anyway
right
uh I don't know about Dylan Dylan
Mulvaney
yeah
uh
uh how do you lessen debate experts and
increase stem experts
uh
well how does he so he says how does
cernovich have more followers than I do
he tweets better
that's it
he's clearly one of the best tweeters
on all of Twitter I mean you'd have to
put him in the top ten if any any group
uh you find Kerry Lake more persuasive
than DeSantis
I said that's a tie
because they both persuade their base
and both
perfectly
I mean
a DeSantis Carey Lake
oh my God imagine that
I don't think it'll be 2024 but like
imagine
a DeSantis Carrie Lake
and I don't know who would be president
who would be vice president but
that would be really strong
UK has a new pm
terrific should I learn the name of the
new UK prime minister
or should I just
put some lettuce on the counter and
call it a day
wait a month
would you advise Trump for a 20 are you
saying would I advise him whether he
should run
I can't advise him on that that's just
personal uh would I advise them in
general no
I'm not not in the sense of uh having
private meetings to advise him no
no because then I would have to disclose
that and then I would no longer
you know it would hurt my sense of
Independence if I have any so I'd rather
say in public what I think you should do
and let all of you wrestle with it and
if any of that gets to him
good
Chinese stocks are down 15 percent
since when today
they didn't drop 15 today didn't they
can you give me a fact check on that
Chinese stock market did it it crashed
today
15 percent
do you know what I call that
a good start
because I'm just getting started
they shouldn't have killed my kid
a child doesn't know they're in a death
match with me
now
I don't know if I can make any
difference I just know things tend to go
my way in the long run
yeah I don't think we want them to
completely collapse but we might want
them to uh
be licking their wounds a little bit
uh
yeah I saw that uh
some people three people died from
buying cocaine from the same Source but
it wasn't cocaine it was Fentanyl
mostly
yeah 15 isn't much of a drop
by the way the the way you should look
at our current
um stock market pullback how much are we
down from the high 25 percent
maybe less new 20 get give me a fact
check
uh how much are we down on our own stock
market High the United States stock
market down 20 or 25 something like that
not seven I think it was I think it's
it's pulled back up a little bit to
maybe 25 all right so somewhere in that
neighborhood here's how you should think
about that
that's exactly what it was supposed to
do
before the U.S stock market went down
you know so it's bouncing around in that
20 to 30 range let's say 25 as as my
talking point if it's around 25 or let's
say the average of the bottom
that's exactly what it was supposed to
do for it for a healthy stock market
let me put it another way it would have
been much worse if the bubble had
increased
if if your stock market has a history of
getting ahead of itself and then pulling
back 25. getting ahead of itself pulling
back 25.
you're in good shape
you would love it to be you know maybe
more graceful
but that's exactly what you needed so if
I told you before this is a Mark Twain
observation that people can't tell the
difference between good news and bad
news
like that's literally true you can't
tell the difference between good news
and bad news so before the stock market
correction
I was really worried about the stock
market
do you know why
because it was too high
and to my mind it looked about 25 too
high
and when the correction came and it went
down 25 do you know what I said
oh perfect
perfect we're now back where we need to
be
because the worst thing you could have
is your your risk and your your reality
be at a whack you want your risk and
your reality to be somewhat rebalanced
every now and then so our risk went up
so the you know you had to rebalance it
so that's that's the most optimistic
thing I can say about the stock market
is it was supposed to go down 25 it had
to and you'd be really in trouble if it
didn't
right and I think Warren Buffett
probably called it
Etc
now my biggest problem when the stock
market was high
is I was trying to figure out how to
conserve cash because I was sure it was
going to go down 25 percent
but unfortunately my conserving cash
coincided with my divorce
you know and the cash is the first thing
that you you move around because it's
easy
so I missed out on this drop
so I I was I was Cash poor at the time
that I would have gone in hard
uh and I was still going hard but all my
cash is sitting somewhere I wanted to be
right now
all right
uh so and and some people are saying
it's not done but that'll always be the
case
uh
all right
you see more Electronics not made in
China well that must have
started a long time ago or you wouldn't
be seeing it now
how has your perspective changed from 20
years ago
wow that's a big question I think that's
too big of a question
you know in some ways in some ways you
probably feel the same in some ways
you're always the same person
but
um I I've seen things in the last few
years that I've never seen before
like
so I would say that my
my automatic response to what's a
conspiracy theory
versus what is completely true
is very different
because if you told me before that the
Democrats had run the the Russia
collusion scheme
and completely got away with it meaning
that nobody went to jail
I would have said no
no come on really
and if somebody said that 50 former and
current Intel people uh signed a lie and
and the News put it on the air
I would have said well you can't give 50
people to do that I mean seriously how
are you getting 50 people to put their
name on a lie
and it happened
it happened or how about the entire news
industry would report that Trump called
neo-nazi's Fine people which of course
never happened
now if you had told me that that could
happen
when the the proof that it didn't happen
is as easy as looking at the video
you just look at it
just don't look at it in the edited form
you just have to look at it
in the larger forum and that's the whole
story
if you told me that the news could have
pulled that off and that it's still
succeeding to this day almost all
Democrats think that really happened
and likewise the drinking bleach and all
the other hoaxes none of those would
have seemed believable to me
five years ago
you know the the famous hoax list the
hoax quiz that I put together has got 16
hoaxes on it
if you'd showed me all of those hoaxes
five years ago and said do you think
anybody could pull these off
I would have said no I mean you can get
somebody to believe anything but you're
not going to get like all Democrats
to believe all 16 of these hoaxes
and then they did they got all Democrats
to believe all 16 of those
now if you think that's only because
they're Democrats then you've missed
everything I've taught you
it's because they're human
it has nothing to do with being extra
gullible
right it's not that it's just that
they're human if you don't think that
that could happen to you
well that will be the surprise you have
coming
uh
uh
all right
greater references all right just
looking at your comments for a moment I
think we've done what we needed to do
and
thank you for uh sticking with me when I
was going through my
grumpy uh
wrong medication problem if you missed
the beginning of the live stream I
figured out my problem my blood pressure
meds were making me suicidal
like actually literally uh but now I
stopped taking him so all good I feel
great I actually feel
let me be clear I feel
great
it was completely compute completely
solved except I have high blood pressure
so I have to figure out that
all right that's all for now
thanks for uh helping me pull through
this and I will talk to you
