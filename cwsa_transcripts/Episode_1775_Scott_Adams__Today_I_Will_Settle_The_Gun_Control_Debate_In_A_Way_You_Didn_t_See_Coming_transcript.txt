good morning everybody
and welcome to
not only the highlight of civilization
coffee with scott adams
but
i think you can tell already if you're
watching this as opposed to listening to
it
that it's special for another reason
it's laundry day that's why i'm wearing
this green t-shirt
which i think you'll agree does not
accentuate my eyes in a way that really
should
but other than that
and one other special thing
tomorrow
i'm looking at humorous memes going by
on the locals platform at the same
time tomorrow is a very special live
stream
it is number 1776
also known as
1776 also known as
freedom
so should we do something special for
that well you think about that and so
will i but in the meantime let's take it
up a notch with a copper mug or a glass
a tanker chelsea stein a canteen joke or
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite
freedom loving beverage
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine here of the day
the thing that's going to make
everything feel better
it's called the simultaneous sip watch
this set your body
into an electric pulsating gyrating
throbbing
pleasure zone that you've never
experienced before ago
you were already there somebody says
they were already there and
i think that's the way it should be
the moment
it's even approaching
you should feel yourself starting to get
into the mood
well elon musk made news today by
tweeting
uh i guess i should just start every
live stream with that elon musk made
some news today by tweeting and then
fill in the blank today's film the blank
is
he uh voted for a republican
i guess in the special election in texas
the republican one
and that's supposed to mean something
and the news is that
trump still has influence on the
republican party
uh but
musk also tweeted that he's leaning
toward desantis
for his presidential preference
leaning toward desantis
to which i say
did he just end trump's
presidential
chances for running
so i think it all comes down to uh does
desantis run
i think at this point if
if elon musk says you would vote for
desantis
and if desantis ran
i think he'd run i think he'd win
what do you think
now don't don't tell me what you think
should happen because you might have a
preference of what happens but what do
you think would happen
trump let's say a primary trump versus
desantis straight up
because i'm wondering who
desantis could sell himself
as the
younger
less controversial
version of a trump-like
republican
how isn't that a good package i guess
he's just not as interesting
but he's getting good at that too you
have to admit i would say
one of my uh
complaints if you could call it that may
be a criticism
of earlier desantis's he wasn't
interesting
when i heard him talk it was like
standard stuff by a standard looking guy
so he just didn't jump out but as as
governor
he's done a whole bunch of stuff and had
a bunch of uh quotable lines and and he
does now he's getting the whole
provocation thing a little bit better
you know getting attention
all right so uh
if desantis and trump
ran straight up in a primary nobody else
is in it
so you seem you seem a little bit split
i'm looking at the audience coming in
the comments
and there's not
there's not a clear opinion of who would
win that huh
and i think that's
that's the right opinion
i think the right opinion is there's no
way to call that what is there
but i will stand by this here's my
prediction
if desantis runs
probably will only be because trump
didn't
because it would feel like a suicide
mission to some extent
running against trump
as opposed to waiting four years and and
running without trump you know in the
mix
i would wait four years i'd get out of
the way of the buzzsaw
because you human
i mean trump would just savage to set us
in a primary it would be
but
um
it would be quite a divisive thing i
don't think different i don't know i
i think my take on desantis is
that he's a smart risk taker
would you say that's a a fair assessment
he seems to be real good on the risk
management like what's the risk what's
the benefit because he's done some
things that look
closer to the risk line than you're used
to
like he he feeds the base better than
other people and as close as he's been
flying you know to the sun
he has not touched the sun yet
could we say that i i think we could say
that and actually that's the most
impressive thing about him so far
is he has the best ratio of close to the
sun
without actually touching the sun
so you know who knows if that means it's
more dangerous or or he's just better at
it so
that's subjective
all right yeah he doesn't have the trump
dance moves that's true
i will keep an eye on that
um
so there's some news that might be fake
news about fake news
this could be a double fake news so i
only saw it from one source
i would want to see this from another
source
so i'm gonna i'm gonna put the big
question mark on this one
and allegedly there's some insider
reports
that the biden administration would be
disciplining
the department of homeland security you
know the border patrol agents who are on
horses
who are accused of whipping the
immigrants coming across the border
now the
the photographic evidence
completely exonerates them as they were
whipping their horses
in a way that you control these specific
kind of horses
right so they have this big
uh is it even a whip
i'm not even sure if you call it a whip
right or is it just the rains
it's the rains right yeah so they have
the extra long rains that they can sort
of
you know control the horse with so i
believe the real story is they were
controlling the horse
but if you saw it from the wrong angle
it would look like they were aiming at
the
the immigrants
so
the for the base of fake news
is that they were whipping the
immigrants
so that's where the fake news started
but now there's a report that the people
who did not whip any immigrants at all
are going to be disciplined or at least
they'll be you know part of an
investigation or something
and i thought to myself i'm not sure if
that story is true
this might be fake news about the fake
news
so you know what you should think about
this
nothing because
there's not enough substance to any of
this it's literally fake news about fake
news let's just forget that one like it
didn't even happen
or that's just like an appetizer or
something
all right here's a uh interesting
interesting story
and
it's going to cause me to be able to
completely
solve
a gun control debate in this country
would you like me to do that
who would like me to reframe
the gun debate in this country and just
completely solve it and by solving i
mean come up with an answer that both
democrats and republicans would say you
know
well that's not perfect
but you know i think you're on to
something that's something we could
agree on
do you think i could do it
challenge me
can i come up with a solution
that would be loved by both democrats
and republicans
it's impossible it's impossible it can't
be done
all right
so i was looking at a tweet by claire
layman
and it showed a graph
where it showed the the number of gun
the gun ownership per capita
of a number of major countries
and then on one so on one axis was the
number of guns
you know per thousand people
the other axis was the number of murders
per thousand people so everything's per
capita right you know adjusted for
population
and it showed that you know there's a
big clump of countries the majority of
them
were all down there in the lower
lower area
where they had the fewest guns
and the fewest murders
and then way up in the right completely
an outlier from all this you know other
civilized countries
was the united states
far and away than most guns
far and away the most murders
and so
um
michael and the point if it was to show
that the the more guns you have the more
murderers you have
i i presume that was the point of it i'm
not a mind reader but i would think that
would be the point of publishing that
right
now first of all do you believe that
that's true
do you believe the data is true i think
it's true isn't it
on a per capita basis now remember we're
not we weren't
we weren't comparing to every country in
the world it was sort of the
you know the closer to the peer group
all right
well murders yeah murder is not
equal to guns but i maybe i misstated
what the
one of the axis's axes was
but the point is
that we have the most guns and and the
murder rate is
high and most of those guns
so
all right so that's the starting point
and then i saw that retweeted by michael
sherber
and he noted that he's been arguing that
you know how could you argue
against
the point that i guess michael shermer
has made before
a number of times
i i take that in the context
that uh
his case is that
the more gun ownership there is the more
murderer there is
so he was sort of uh boosting this by
saying here you go you know what other
what other explanation is there
so what other explanation is there
has he made his case
does the data speak for itself
i mean if that data were true
would you accept the fact that even
though you might
now hold on for a second before we go
any further
let me tell you don't try to anticipate
what my opinion is yet
don't try to anticipate what my opinion
is yet
because you'll just get all twisted up
so just just go with me okay just just
take the trip
it's just a journey enjoy the journey
all right
so what's interesting about michael
shermer is i've i've read his stuff for
a long time
and he is um
i would say uniquely data and logic
oriented
which is different from saying i always
agree with his takes
but he's always very
look at the data look at the logic
you know escape from the
politics of it so he's very good in
terms of trying to be reasonable i i
would put him in the
you know the serious people category
people you should pay attention to
and he says
he just looks at this and says you know
duh basically
the most gun ownership the most
murderers by far
how in the world
does he has he not made his case
and he said what else could it be and he
listed some other possibilities you know
is it racism is it
is it
something else
to which i answered
and accidentally realized that it solved
the gun debate
and i responded to his tweet this way
and said
it's obviously
systemic racism
that chart
is literally showing you systemic racism
which is caused by the school
school system
which is caused by the teachers unions
that chart shows that
let me prove it to you in
if you don't if you don't follow that
chain
let me make the case in
10 seconds all right here's a 10 second
argument
to make the case
that that chart is showing you systemic
racism 10 seconds i think i can do it 10
maybe 15.
imagine if for the last 30 years
the school system had produced
just as good black students as every
other group
in other words everybody had a good
education
which is very much not the case
for the past however many decades you
want to go 50 years whatever
just imagine it's just a thought
experiment i'm done
i'm done
i just proved that that graph is from
systemic racism because here's what you
just did in your own mind you just
connected all the dots you just said
okay wait a minute
if the
teachers unions had not prevented
competition
for decades
wouldn't we have better education for
everybody because the free market system
and competition would have you know
helped us along the answer is yes
now we may not have reached something
that you would call equality
but imagine if just everybody got a
better education
now don't you think that there's a
pretty direct
correlation between your level of
education
and your economics
and your likely
hood to murder somebody
yes of course
and so i asked
what would what would that gun chart
look like if you
separated it by race in the united
states
suppose you said the united states is
two countries
it's the black population just look at
it separately as if the united states is
just the black population of the united
states
and then say what is the
gun violence rate in that community
it'd be off the chart
and then say all right let's look at the
everything but black community
just to simplify right
and you say what is the gun right there
and it's way lower
so really the united states is not one
one average it's basically it operates
like two countries in this specific
example
now why is it the united states would
have off the chart
black gun violence
well if you were a racist you would say
well there's something wrong with black
people
right because you're a racist you'd say
that right
but isn't it a little bit more likely
that if everybody had a good education
you wouldn't see anything like that
seriously
even even if there are some racists
watching
even if there are some racists watching
this you know who you are
you would admit
that if everybody had a good education
everybody
the gun violence wouldn't look anything
like it looks in the united states who
disagrees with that
now isn't you know there's there's no
quick fix to that but here's the thing
where where could the left and the right
completely come together on gun violence
if you improved education it would go
away
right unless and let's just agree that
systemic racism exists
and that its primary foundational source
you know the thing that fuels it more
than anything
is the lack of good
educational paths to success for
everybody
right
so
how in the world does the left and right
not agree
that if you fix everybody's education
all of these other problems get better
what does the
what is the left
think is the problem with the right
let's say climate change pick any topic
the left would say well the problem with
the right
is that they're not educated enough
about the risks of climate change that's
what the left would say about the right
so wouldn't the left want better
education
because by their view that would get
them more of what they want there'd be
more citizens who believe what they
believe now you might say it could go
the opposite way
but you still want more education
so no matter where you think the
education takes you
everybody believes is good
so it's like the one thing
the one thing everybody agrees on also
solves all the other problems
you just have to sort of think it
through why that is the case
so imagine you had a candidate running
for president
who just said
half of what joe biden says and half of
what trump says
i'm imagining an imaginary president
what joe biden says
sort of laughably is you know these big
problems
there's nothing we can do about it
what am i going to do about inflation
i'm not putin
so the the half that's joe biden is you
know what can you do about it somebody
else caused this wasn't my fault yeah
and then the half that's uh
trump is that he can do things that even
you know are not doable it's like i'll
make the economy zoom and
you know oh everything will be great so
you've got the you know ridiculous
optimist and trump
and you've got the you know can't do it
in biden suppose you suppose you put
them together
and you you created the following
candidate
you know there's almost nothing you can
do about systemic racism today
got to be honest with you there's almost
nothing you can do
about what's already here
and you can try really hard and i think
we should
but you're not going to move it very
very much because once somebody's
45 and
you know their life has been sort of
carved pretty hard into the rocks you
can't change it much but here's where we
could all agree
how about we just put all of our
combined left and right disagreeing
energy into fixing schools for everybody
whatever it takes let's just make it a
national conversation if it's something
about the teachers unions and that's on
the table if it's something about
something else that's on the table too
so why don't we just take all of our
disagreements and say you know there
isn't a damn thing you can do about it
today
but i bet we can fix it for the next
generation
and just make it a next generation
effort
say you know
sorry
sorry about your generation
if we could fix it easily
we'd be willing to do it but it nobody
has really a good idea how to like fix
some things easily but could you fix the
schools
that feels like the most doable thing
for an advanced civilization
you know a successful country
give or take our debt
it seems like that that's well within
our ability
to fix education for everybody and then
you know
then at least you have an argument that
you're doing something about violence
it's not going to help this generation
as much
at least you could say you're doing
something and you found some way to come
together
and that ladies and gentlemen is where
you fix everything
at the same time you're welcome
um i saw a little video and
it looked like it came from tick tock it
was up but it was on twitter
and i didn't i didn't see who to credit
exactly but there was this sort of a man
on the street interview
in which someone i took to be probably
associated with the right based on the
context
was asking people who appeared to be
associated with the left
based on context
if they supported bodily autonomy
and i think it was being asked that some
kind of an abortion
rally pro-abortion rally
and so the people on the left were
saying yes bodily autonomy
my body
you know keep your government away from
my body it's my body
and then the second question was
uh what they thought about
vaccine mandates
and would they say that's the same
argument
that you know stay away from my body
would apply to
abortion
but would they take their argument and
say stay away from my body
with your vaccinations
and
you have to watch
the looks on the faces
of the people being asked the question
their facial expression is almost better
than what they say which ends up being
closer to nonsense than it should be and
you
i've told you before that there's a
cognitive dissonance look
and until you've seen it a number of
times you can't recognize it but once
you have seen it a number of times you
spot it right away
and it's when you see somebody's brain
just reboot
it's like for a moment they go blank
and their brain just stops it's almost
it's almost like
and then whatever comes out next after
the
is just nonsense
it's just
i think i retweeted it so you can see it
in my twitter feed today
uh
but it's sort of hilarious and and you
can even
you can even abstract this from
politics
right i'm i'm only like marginally
interested in the fact that the content
here is politics
what's really interesting
is
legitimately
they're triggered into cognitive
dissonance
and i think there was one of them
that almost slithered out
by saying well one was an emergency
but no
[Laughter]
no
that's not really an argument against
not having bodily autonomy
right
now
my take on this the whole bodily
autonomy is that nobody's ever had it
it's just an illusion if you think you
have any bodily autonomy
because the government can make your
body do anything it was
because they have guns you don't have
any bodily autonomy you can't go do a
crime with your body
i can't go rub my body against your body
just because i want to
i don't have any bodily autonomy
now
that said
i would still like to have as much as i
i could get
like if it's if it's only about me
i want as much as i can get but
sometimes it's not about just me
unfortunately
jason reilly writing for the wall street
journal
i think
i guess it would be an opinion piece but
it was so factual that's hard to say
suggests that we should raise the
immigration caps because there's going
to be a massive already as massive
worker shortage now he's talking about
the more qualified workers the
immigrants who often become
entrepreneurs and stem areas et cetera
so he's saying we should do more of that
and that the
that the two-year pause or so from the
pandemic where we were not bringing in
these highly qualified immigrants
probably is going to show up in the
economy
that that we had a two-year pause where
probably our most qualified group of
entrepreneurs
the ones who come in already qualified
from another country
they
they didn't get
to do their thing for two years that
might actually have a big impact on our
economy down the road
and
you suggested they would do we do more
of it now i would go back to my argument
and
this would be so easy for
somebody like desantis
to take an argument like this
because the one of the big things that
trump got completely wrong with the
border argument
is that once he won the nomination
he should have said what i say which is
let's have an economic opinion about who
to let in
and have the ability to control it
so that when there's an opinion about
who to let in and how many and it
changes we can just change it
that argument would be so easy to win
imagine being on stage and trying to
argue against that
well my my opinion is that we should let
the economist tell us how many people to
come in for the best interest of the
country
and then have enough control to make
that happen
what the hell are you going to say to
that
well really that's a racist idea
to which i'd say
well can you explain which race in the
united states is not in favor of
a better economy in the united states
that would include them
i mean
it's really just a killer
end of discussion argument
all you have to do is frame it right and
you're done
it's almost the easiest
it's probably the easiest argument you
could ever win in politics
in my opinion
you just take the emotion out of it
you know you you want republicans to say
you know what
we've really gotten you know great
benefits from immigration let's let's
have some more of that
but we really want to do it the
republican way
and the republican way
is to
control the parts that we need to
control and
let the free market do the rest
it's just so easy to sell
it's it's just so frustrating watching
nobody
make the most obvious argument there
all right so
um
what else is happening
kimberly guilfoyle
reportedly got sixty thousand dollars
for
basically just introducing don jr
at i think a january 6 rally or
something i don't know what it was
it was a while ago
and people are suggesting that
she was overpaid
what do you think do you think she was
overpaid
uh sixty thousand dollars just to
introduce don jr
nope
no no but nobody who understands the
speaker's market would say she was
overpaid here's the thing that the the
news and i saw david david axelrod
said something like you know i wonder
what that is per word
do you think do you think when they
hired her
or agreed to pay this do you think that
what they thought they were buying were
her words
that's not what they're buying
let me explain how this market works and
it's funny because david axelrod knows
how this market works so i guess it was
a clever way to frame it for political
points or something but david axelrod
knows
that on the speaker circuit they pay for
the personality
the name recognition
you're more likely to go someplace where
where kimberly guilfoyle will be in
person
no matter what she does you're more
likely to want to go there
if she's going to be
there and if don junior's going to be
there you're more likely to go
and if they're both going to be there
you're a little bit more than twice as
likely to go because then you might see
the interaction and that would be even
more interesting
so if you are the organizers what are
you really paying kimberly guilfoyle for
well you're sort of paying her for you
know the name recognition so you could
say hey she'll be here so
bring the crowds but you're kind of
paying her for an inconvenience fee
meaning that she almost certainly had
somewhere else to be that day
and it's not easy to you know pack up
and
you know probably you got hair and
makeup and you know outfit and what are
you going to say you got to get there
it's a pretty big commitment
to get your ass somewhere and stand in
front of a big crowd and do a thing
and in my opinion under those
circumstances the specific circumstances
that she was like
exactly the right person to be doing the
exactly right thing at that time
sixty thousand dollars
i'd say she did a good job in
negotiating
that's all
she just did a good job in negotiating
um
so don lemon
was talking to
biden's spokesperson
karine
jean-pierre
and don lemon was actually giving her a
hard time which i guess is the
first part of the big story so cnn's new
chief
reportedly wants them to start reporting
the news straight
without the bias
now
i don't know how don lemon is going to
pull that off but
he did to his credit
to his credit so i'll give him credit
we're due
he did
push her a bit and he asked this
question directly and he wasn't smiling
when he said it he said does the
president does the president have the
stamina
physically and mentally
do you think to continue on after 2024
now what is the if you're the
spokesperson for the president
and cnn asks you
does your boss have the stamina
physically and mentally
what is the only right answer to that
question
yes
right
what what does it mean if you say
anything else
but how would you interpret
any other words that did not include
y
e
yes
well i would interpret it as
no
here's what she said the first thing out
of her mouth was
that is not a question that we should
even be asking
oh god oh god oh it makes me laugh
look at
the question is so silly
can you look at this sincere smile on my
face i mean look at me it's to laugh
it's still laughing so funny
what because look at the sincerity
i mean i've got sincerity all over my
face
with this smile
i think this puts it in context doesn't
it
yeah you know would i be smiling like
this all sincerely
unless i honestly believe what i was
saying
he is so physically and mentally fit
let me tell you another thing let me
tell you the other thing
let me tell you the other thing
he
he
he's the president
the president's schedule
i guess bill i'm so excited about the
president's schedule it's so much more
than mine
let me tell you
compared to the president
it's like i sleep under my desk
it's like i don't even show up
i do so little work
compared to biden
you should be asking me why i even get
paid
because because he's like this energy
ball
he's like the sun
he's like the sun
and you know compared to me i'd be like
i know
a mosquito or something
i'm nothing
compared to him
to his greatness and his energy he's the
greatest man of all time
and really
and
see
so
why can't we just report that this
president's spokesperson uh just
confirmed that she does not believe he
is
has the stamina physically and mentally
to continue on after 2024
because that's what she said
i don't care
what you tell me
you think she said
i don't know what you're hallucinating
she said
but she just confirmed that he's not up
to the job
and to her credit do you know why she
confirmed it
because even though she's being paid to
lie
she couldn't pull this one off
it made me like her
honestly like when i saw that she
couldn't answer the question like he was
so ridiculously painful hard
i realized that it's because she's
probably honest
i'm just guessing i mean i don't know
her but i worry that her natural
personality might be honest
like maybe she doesn't lie to her
friends
you know doesn't lie to her
her romantic partners or whatever
she might be honest
imagine being an honest person and being
put in that job
that would be like a living hell
and she looked like she was being
tortured
well she answered that question
anyway
um
so according to uh economist julia
pollock in a tweet the fed is finally
beginning to
do quantitative tightening today
so that 9 trillion balance sheet is
going to start coming down
and dragging inflation down with it
here's the way i like to summarize all
stories about inflation and about the
fed
because sometimes when the economists
talk it's a little complicated hard to
follow
so let me let me just break this down
there's something called the fed that
you don't understand
that does something with money you don't
understand
that causes the quantitativeness of the
supply
of the inflation
trend
to mitigate over
i don't know they just do things and
then things happen i'm pretty sure
nobody even understands economics
it does feel a little like astrology
and
i remember
i won't name names but there was someone
i knew
who went to school to be a chiropractor
and learned that there were a number of
things that chiropractors could do that
would
make a difference help people
but the chiropractic school went a
little bit beyond the things that seem
to have good data backing them up
you know things like curing the common
cold and
your cancer and
every other damn thing
and eventually when he had been
completely trained as a chiropractor he
said to himself i can't do this for a
living
it's too bogus so he actually completed
the the training and said i i can't even
do this now even even though
and let me be clear
there do appear to be parts of
chiropracti that are valuable and
medically
medically supported and all that
but you do hear stories of chiropractors
with claims that are just so obviously
not true
that
um
anyway
so when i uh studied economics
in college i got to the point where
i learned enough about economics to
to think that most of what i saw was
guessing
because things are too complicated to
really predict well
and so the more you know about your own
field
the the less credibility it has
have you ever noticed that
everything looks good until you
learn about it and then you're like
you know that russian army sure looks
good well let's take a closer look
although
to their credit they did win
so it does look like russians
russia is just solidly winning
and
and
what would you say of the u.s strategy
can we be pleased with our strategy
could it be said that
russia won and
nato won
but ukraine lost
could that be said
because nato sort of had to uh push back
a little bit right
even even if it's this indirect way by
supporting them
no
you don't think nato needed to
show that it had a little bit of
backbone to make it harder for
russia to expand
but i suppose you could say that
russia always thought that ukraine was
part of it so it's not it's not an
expansion
except depending on your point of view
nato lost to
yeah maybe so although nato is gaining
members
yeah it's an interesting argument i
heard the argument that um
we made a mistake we the west made a
mistake challenging putin
because we should have understood
history
and understood that russia is an
imperialist country
and they would never
they would never accept anybody you know
moving into their
sort of
territory that maybe they thought they
should influence
to which i said to myself
well by that standard you should let
everybody who has bad behavior do it
because if you don't
they'll be mad
i don't know maybe maybe it depends how
many nukes you have that changes the
calculation
by the way i saw a meme of showing
i think it was hiroshima after
after it had been nuked
and then showing it today so you see in
one picture it's rubble and then today
it's you know a gleaming city
and then it showed detroit
the same year as hiroshima you know
bustling city and this shows detroit
today
not looking so good
and i'm thinking
that's in one lifetime
that's in one lifetime
yeah so i see some people saying their
chiropractors have helped them
that is that is certainly true
all right
i believe that's all that's happening
today were there any stories i forgot
about
now
um there's one other way that the left
and the right can come together i forgot
this one now it's a smaller way but i
think every little every little way that
the left and right can come together is
is useful
so one of the things that the
the left wants is they want
less gun violence
they also want
uh in many cases young people to be able
to transition
from
do you say transition their gender
or is it
i'm not sure i'm never sure if i'm using
the right words
but uh
so the people on the left are more
favorable toward younger people
transitioning
here's the question i ask
how many mass murders have been
committed
by someone who was trans
i think it's zero
so correct me if i'm wrong on the math
the more people who are trans
the fewer
murders per capita
you follow that logic no that doesn't
make sense at all i'm not serious
how many people thought i was serious
oh don't get serious on me okay you're
talking about
suicides that's serious
all right
um
yeah
isn't it it is remarkable that
a community that small percentage-wise
is having such a big impact on our
on our psyche
and did you see the controversy of i
guess
um
i think uh
ben shapiro and matt walsh were mad at
fox news for running a piece
that was
uh if i would characterize it it would
be
pro-trans i guess and pro-trans for
young kids so it was a story about a
young kid who at five years old or even
even before
uh so the kid is now identifying as male
and as transitioned so we'll say he
but
but allegedly
knew he was the wrong gender
uh before he could speak or something
like that because the parent said yes
he was obviously uncomfortable and
girl's clothing and stuff like that now
as
some people have pointed out
there are quite a few
boys who are
kind of fluid at that age and then it
gets sorted out later
so can you really tell
what somebody's gender identity is at
that age
here's where i'm gonna really make you
mad
i think you can sometimes
but here's the problem how do you know
you're right
you don't have a way to know you're
right
so let me say it again if it's true
if you if you accept the notion
that
people are you know born in the wrong
they're misgendered or whatever the word
is if you buy that notion
that it's something that an adult
can later understand and make their own
decision
if you buy that as a legitimate path
which i do because once you're an adult
make your own decisions
but that doesn't mean that it's not
always there
so by by my way of thinking sometimes at
five
you know
but sometimes
you think you know and you're wrong
and then they just
you know they're just normal fluid
kids who settle on you know the gender
that they look
so
would you disagree with my assessment
that if it's true that they will always
be let's say there's a five-year-old and
if you could see the future if you
didn't do anything
you know if you just ignored it they
would grow up to be somebody who as an
adult says you know i'm gonna have this
transition
you know it's always been with me
nothing ever changed
i'm gonna i'm gonna see if i can solve
my problem with this transition
don't you think it was there when they
were five
because i do
i think it was there when they were five
i just think you can't accurately
identify it
i'm really interested in the people
saying i saw a no
are there people on here who think
that's not biological
are there so are there some people who
think that's a hundred percent
social construct
really
because i don't think there's any chance
of that
i
you know here's here's the sort of thing
that influences me on this
did you ever see the show about the two
twins who were separated at birth
it was two guys who both grew up and
without knowing anything about each
other literally separated at birth
they learned that they had a twin and
then they decided to get together
and they had both grown up to be become
firemen
now that would be quite a coincidence
right they both grew up to be firemen in
different places raised by different
parents didn't know each other
i think they both showed up in
suspenders
i think they put they bought the same
gift for each other
and there were a whole bunch of other
things that they did that looked like
lifestyle choices
they were identical
and they were raised completely
differently without knowing each other
now
does that suggest that even really
things that look like lifestyle choices
are baked in when you're born i think it
does
i think it does i you know there are
things about me now that are clearly
were obvious when i was five years old
when i was five years old i wanted to be
a cartoonist
like there's just some things that
just don't change like it's just baked
into you and
you know i'm i mean i wanted to be a
creative person i think that's the part
that was baked in not the cartoonist
specifically
but
doesn't mean biological
well what i'm saying is that
there does seem to be
people who
have a physical
sex
situation
that differs from their internal view
would you agree that that's true
would everybody agree that there are
real
people who without society causing it
their their brain feels one gender but
their body looks another do you agree
that they exist
i think they exist
yeah i mean there are plenty of people
who say they are those people i have no
reason to doubt it
so i think they exist but a lot of you
say no
interesting and on youtube a lot of
people are saying no
that they think that that doesn't exist
interesting
i think you're completely wrong
but i don't completely dismiss it
because it's in the category of things
that well
maybe i mean i think you're wrong
i do think that
i do think that that's the sort of
difference that could be baked in
well let me let me tell you how easily
that could be true
would you agree that your the chemistry
when you're
being formed you know the specific
chemistry
would influence whether you're male or
female
like or
uh maybe that's too strong because
that's just the
sperm and the egg but if you if you were
to change the chemistry in which the
sperm and the egg were
incubating
you could cause them to be more
masculine and more feminine
right
i think that's true you so even though
their chromosomes are what the
chromosomes are
you can influence how masculine or how
feminine they are within their
within their sex
right
so if that's true
could you imagine a situation in which
the chemistry was not the same all the
way through
in other words could you imagine a case
where the brain was forming um
after the genitals
or the other way around
that the the brain part that influences
your sexuality
gets formed first and then maybe your
body chemistry is changes before your
i know or something like that
so i'm just i'm just speculating that
one could imagine
that there are people who don't have the
same body chemistry all the way through
pregnancy and that there might be some
kind of a radical change that would
cause you to start developing one way
and then finish developing another way
and be sort of
a blended
situation and then have to choose
which one makes you happier you know to
or or not choose i suppose that's a
choice as well
all right
so enough about that
enough about that
can you imagine a person with impulsive
violence that is unaffected by education
yes but they're
they're the exception
all right that's enough for now i'll
talk to you youtube tomorrow
clearly one of the best live streams
you've ever seen
not as good as yesterday
but one of the best
one of the best and tomorrow
wow it's gonna be great bye for now
