good morning everybody and welcome to the 
highlight of human civilization which is  
now available only on locals because all the 
other platforms are broken today for reasons  
that I could figure out I spent all of my time 
trying to do it and did lots of live streams  
that didn't work until it did and I tried every 
single thing but I don't have time to do that  
this morning so today it's all you if you'd like 
to take your experience up a level all you need is  
a CER muger glass a tanker cheler Stein a canteen 
suer flask a vessel of any kind fill it with your  
favorite liquid I like coffee and join me now for 
the unparallel pleasure the dopamine end of the  
day the thing that makes everything better 
it's called simultaneous sip it happens now
go so good so so good well Italian politics 
is more fun than ours I don't know if you  
do this but the Italian Prime Minister 
Georgio Milani she publicly broke up  
with her partner over lwd behavior on his 
television show I guess he's a host on some  
some newsy entertainment show and he uh 
he was seeing off camera but the camera  
was on hitting on a coworker and asking if he 
could play with his genitals while he talked
so that that was the boyfriend of Italy's 
Prime Minister so she dumped his ass after  
several years together in a child and she's 
like done with that guy I've got a feeling  
that's not the first time he ever flirted um 
Justin Israel has decided to uh um shut down  
some news bureaus I think ljo so they're going 
to shut down ljo access uh they got rid of that  
channel in Israel now do you remember when 
you thought that Free Speech was a real thing  
that I think this is the year that I finally 
realized hey it was never real it was never
real um yeah no it turns out that nobody ever had 
free speech the only free speech anybody has is  
to be uninteresting to the government that's it as 
soon as the government is interested they say well  
we have Free Speech but I have to change this 
one thing because there's a reason how hard is  
it for them to come up with a reason they just 
have to be interested so we've always had this  
illusion that we had free speech because we can 
say things that agreed with the government then  
we're like yeah we can you can word it any way 
you want it's free so anyway we don't have free  
speech in America Israel doesn't have free speech 
and nobody has free speech in the time of War you  
know as soon as a war breaks out that's the end 
of free speech it will always be thus bill marah  
is being tough on colleges he's basically his 
advice to young people is don't go to college  
because it makes you dumber and then he gave lots 
of you know lots of reasons such as supporting  
Hamas so I don't think we need to go into that but 
it's just interesting that bill Mah is saying it  
directly and out loud that the colleges are broken 
and they're not making you better people um so Joe  
Rogan is talking about how the risk that our open 
borders are letting in lots of terrorists makes  
it almost kind of predictable that we're going to 
have some kind of terror attack that looks a lot  
like Hamas attacking Israel now the interesting 
part about that um is that Elon Musk replied to  
uh an X poost about that and musk said that given 
that the border is wide open as a matter of policy  
by the current Administration it is simply a 
matter of time before this happens if it has  
not happened already mean happened meaning lots 
of terrorists coming in to attack the country  
now you agree with that right what what else 
could happen it's not like there are two things  
that could happen in our current situation if 
you allow people to come in just because they  
claimed Asylum how do you not have major terrorist 
attacks what what would be any way that could not  
happen I can't think of one so um the the weird 
thing about this is that is right in front of us  
and yet on the xplatform somebody replied to me 
saying that it's a myth that the border is open  
in 2023 somebody said that's a myth and and they 
pointed to that axio article and the axios article  
basically ignored the Asylum part of it and just 
talked about how the you know the border security  
and fencing is better than it was H how do people 
watching this topic not know that the real problem  
is that people are coming in completely legally 
but shouldn't all they have to do is say Asylum  
and come in the front door and and we just say 
come on in get back to us in seven months and  
somehow there are people who don't know that the 
most important thing that they don't have to sneak  
across the border they just say Asylum here's 
my name see in seven months or not all right  
so that's happening the complete abandonment of 
security for the country uh there was a big uh  
rally last night and support of the Palestinians 
in New York City and I saw a video of it it was  
a big big Crow uh supporting the Palestinians in 
Gaza and I'm no expert on fundraising but wouldn't  
that be the perfect place to raise funds to donate 
to the Palestinians in Gaza I mean I would I would  
just be collecting money like crazy because these 
people not only care but they care enough to like  
give up their evening Friday night and go out 
and March in the in the weather and everything so  
those are people really care I would ask them for 
their money or is it possible that they don't have  
money and they think there somebody else should 
be paying that money I'm just wondering I don't  
know but yeah let's uh in fact I I was thinking 
of organizing uh rallies and that support the the  
innocent Palestinian Palestinians not the Hamas 
but the ones who were uh just victims in Gaza I  
should organize some big demonstrations in their 
behalf and collect money from all the participants  
is that a good idea I think it's a great idea all 
right um there's more uh CNN porn about uh Trump  
Now CNN porn is when CNN reports a story it puts a 
spin on it that sounds like the walls are closing  
in on Trump and then all their readers read it 
and go oh oh I got it now the walls are closing  
in so the latest walls are closing in story which 
my smart Democrat friend I've mentioned a lot my  
smart Democrat friend immediately texted me to 
say that uh this lawyer Kenneth uh chz chz bro  
cheese bro really is he a cheese bro I hope it's 
Chessa bro I hate to think he's sort of a cheese  
bro hey got some gouda cheese bro got some barbes 
on over there I feel like that's the way it would  
go if it's cheese bro I hope it's chesbro or 
something like that but anyway he's a prot trump  
attorney and he's one of the ones who is involved 
with the January 6 you know the plan to see what  
they could do about it uh I say without Spin and 
uh he has taken a deal took a deal and part of  
his deal is that he will um he will he agrees to 
testify in the Trump trial so do you know what the  
Democrats say when they hear that somebody who 
worked with Trump is getting ready to testify  
honestly here's what the Democrats do oh God since 
we know he's guilty we're going to start with the  
result because that's how they think they don't 
have the whole cause and effect they work down  
quite in their minds so they start with the end 
point he's definitely guilty because he's Trump  
and Trump is guilty and he's Trump so therefore 
ipof facto QED he's Trump and he's guilty and  
he's Trump so therefore he's guilty so right we'll 
start with that as our assumption and then we'll  
see what happened today there's a lawyer who knows 
the good stuff he knows the truth and he's going  
to be testifying about Trump who because he's 
Trump must be guilty and he's guilty because  
he's Trump therefore logically this lawyer will 
have bad stuff to say about him because that's  
part of his plea deal he has to tell the truth 
so he'll tell the truth and the truth will be bad  
for Trump because Trump is bad because he's bad 
yeah I actually had to deal with that yesterday  
you know what the real story is we have no idea 
we have no idea what the real story is but I'll  
tell you what it looks like to me my non tdsi now 
maybe I have a bias in the other direction totally  
possible I wouldn't know it if I if it were the 
case but here's what it looks like it looks like  
uh both Sydney Powell and Kenneth chesbro were way 
overcharged and now the prosecutors are reversing  
it because it wasn't sustainable so they just 
brought it down to the minimum thing that somebody  
would say yes to just to you know get it out of 
their life and then he said yes to it and that's  
the whole story they were overcharged so they 
pled down to a little thing said they would tell  
the truth if they were on trial which all lawyers 
say yes to you you think that there's a working  
lawyer who's going to say well if I testify I was 
thinking about maybe not telling the truth now  
this story tells you literally nothing about Trump 
literally nothing and there people celebrating it  
because they learned literally nothing but their 
TDS was triggered so their dopamine got a hit and  
they're just trembling in excitement I don't think 
it's going to turn out the way they think that's  
my prediction well the Senate operations center 
in Washington DC had to put down a uh long list of  
suggestions about how not to be killed or robbed 
if you leave the building in in the Capitol Hill  
area apparently it's so dangerous that you need 
to be given instructions on Surviving walking  
Outdoors I'm not joking they had to give them 
survival instructions for walking outdoors in  
locally that's real there's no exaggeration 
there they had to tell them how to survive  
just going Outdoors because of all the crime and 
uh among among the things they're teaching them  
is how to surrender their goods so they're being 
taught to peacefully give over their car to the  
carjackers that's the advice yeah so they're 
actually being taught to surrender to the gri
okay in a totally unrelated story um do you know 
zubie everybody knows zubie from the xplatform  
and other places he's a rapper he's a political 
philosopher all around good guy and he uh posted  
this today he said if you can't help someone 
with a victim mentality then distance yourself  
from them huh you can't help someone with a 
victim mentality you should distance yourself  
from them you know what I thought when I read 
that I thought you know I wish I'd worded it  
that way while being black I wouldn't have been 
cancelled but you know zubie is saying exactly  
what I said he just says it better right I got 
cancelled globally for saying what zubie can post  
any time he wants what's the difference oh yeah 
I'm starting to think there might be a pattern
here well I love the story about Trump's gag 
order where he's he's now supposed to say bad  
things about the prosecutor or the judge or 
the witnesses and his upcoming case but he uh  
apparently there was still some reference to a 
bad mean tweet that was on his uh his campaign  
website now the mean tweet had been deleted 
or was actually a truth the mean truth from  
his truth network uh had been deleted so he was 
complying with the gag order but apparently there  
was an oversight and they didn't realize it was 
still on some page on the uh campaign page and so  
he gets fined $5,000 for something that nobody 
really thought was intentional $5,000 now of  
course you know that doesn't hurt him but would 
anybody else have been fine $5,000 wouldn't the  
more logical thing to be hey there's this thing 
that you should also take care of maybe you missed  
it so can you take care of this by tomorrow or 
I'll have to find you don't you think that's the  
way that should have played out yeah given that 
it was obvious that it looked like an oversight  
because it was taken down where you could see it 
easily but it was left up where somebody didn't  
notice why would you find somebody for that who 
who's who's better off for that is the public  
protected I don't see how if you gave him a day 
to take it down and he didn't take it down you  
can still find them the it's so obvious that this 
is just targeted weaponization like even in small  
ways that aren't really going to hurt Trump 
at all but it's it's obvious that it's just  
they're using it as a weapon you wouldn't do this 
for somebody who is just an ordinary citizen who  
maybe didn't know that there was still something 
they needed to address that's it well now I guess  
the gag order is suspended or ter temporarily 
Frozen uh because Trump is fighting it you know  
in cords so the judge said well we'll suspend it 
while you're fighting it um so there's a little  
update on the George Floyd case apparently uh 
somebody who was working on the prosecution  
is uh spilling the juice that apparently when she 
talked to the coiner the coiner said there was no  
indication of asphixiation which would have been 
the murder part uh but that the coroner worried  
what happens when the evidence doesn't match 
the narrative and people people will lose their  
careers so here's the Smoking Gun that the coroner 
lied to protect himself and all the other people
involved that's actually in evidence now now it's 
it's still heay right so it's still one person  
telling you their experience and then relaying 
it to you so here say has to be put in its you  
know proper place you would need some confirming 
evidence but here's some confirming evidence I  
watched the video a 100 times I see anybody get 
murdered did you I saw somebody a die of a fenal  
open this that's what I saw now I saw that from 
the start I never saw anything different no matter  
how many times I watched it and do you know why 
I'm pretty sure that it wasn't a murder because  
because shauan was doing it in front of people 
with cameras you you this is one of those few  
times when you can know for certain what was in 
his mind what was in his mind for certain because  
he was on camera talking to the people who are 
filming Him Live he didn't think he was breaking  
a law that clearly because he did it calmly and 
cooly in front of lots of people under the you  
know under the power of law there's no way any 
human being acts that way if they believe they're  
murdering somebody in front of a whole bunch 
of Witnesses were fil it's not like he thought  
he'd get away what was he going to change his 
name and run away no this is one of those few  
times you can be completely certain that he was 
not aware that there was you know that it looked  
like murder now there's also the question that I 
saw somebody say that once the suspect is taken  
into custody the the well-being of that suspect is 
the responsibility of the officers and indeed some  
of the other officers were were warning choven 
that there might be a problem so given that he  
was responsible and given that you know show that 
Floyd was complaining and the other officers were  
concerned that should have been enough say some 
to make it still Shin's uh responsibility in his  
fault do you know what I say I say he asked him if 
he was on drugs and Floyd said no when Floyd said  
no he killed himself that's it had he said yes all 
of the officers would have been trained to know  
that the problem might be more medical than they 
first thought had he said yes I have fentanyl in  
my system and I don't know how much and I'm having 
trouble breathing do you think do you think they  
would have treated it the same if he had not lied 
to them about his medical situation so people are  
saying he kept saying I couldn't breathe which was 
a accurate thing he said about his health but he  
also said something that killed him which is he 
didn't have drugs in now do I think that shovin  
or a different officer could have been smart 
enough to still put together the facts and keep  
him alive maybe maybe but that's not what he 
was charged with to me it looked like it was  
he was charged because he was white uh people 
were afraid of the reaction and that's always  
has been obvious now I thought when this new 
news came out terer Carlson is one reporting it  
making it a big deal but I thought everybody knew 
that it wasn't a murder and that he that Shin was  
just being railroaded for being white I thought 
everybody knew that so it didn't strike me as new
news anyway um here's something that I see 
a lot of uh that black people in particular  
particular literally don't believe white 
men when they tell them their own personal  
experience so a comment on this was from 
somebody named Cliffside on the xplatform  
he says uh about the George Floyd story 
says well I was treated to nearly 80 hours  
of racial training in a one-year period watched 
my employer nearly double the racial quotas saw  
two years of hiring not a single white male and 
then got laid off to make way as stated in one  
such training quote it's your turn to suffer 
and immediately somebody said said that never
happened now I don't know if this specific 
thing never happened but do you imagine this  
is a story of a great weirdness no this is the 
ordinary experience of white men in America for  
the last 30 years it's all like this it's like 
this all the time do you know why you didn't  
know about it if you're black do you know 
why you don't know about it because people  
are afraid to tell you they're afraid to tell 
you all of us we're all afraid to tell you and  
should be it's not it's not an irrational fear 
it's very rational fear so people just shut up  
I'll tell you the one the one thing that I've 
totally been train trained off of is the idea  
that you can't make a whole bunch of people 
act one way if they know it's fake or if they  
know they're all lying you can't make tons of 
people just act the same way there's always  
going to be somebody who will dissent no not 
when money is involved when money is involved  
people just go the same way and everybody knew 
that their careers and their livelihoods and  
their families were at risk if they said what they 
saw with their own eyes which is obviously not a
murder all
right all right uh Christopher rufo posted this 
he said I almost feel pity for the BLM era gurus  
ibram kendi Patrice cullors Robin D'Angelo 
and sha King The Establishment desperately  
wanted to uh summon moral figureheads for 
their racial Reckoning and all they could  
find was a Rogues gallery of intellectually 
vapid scam artists so yeah turns out that the  
leaders of the movements uh we're largely 
just scam artists so we know that now all  
right I've got a question for people who suffer 
from TDs is there anybody here who suffers from
TDS anybody else oh you're probably you're 
all CER if you're on this platform but here's  
a question if I needed some cash and I 
told you I wanted to quote find a bank  
with an ATM I want to find a bank with an 
ATM can I be indicted for attempted bank
robbery because I wanted to find find a 
bank with an ATM because because find in  
that context means rob the bank doesn't it well 
you wait you wouldn't wouldn't you interpret it  
that way I I thought like find the votes you 
know means do something illegal find an ATM at  
a bank would be robbed the ATM I don't know how 
else to interpret it so never ever say to your  
friends you'd like to find a bank with an ATM 
because you're just admitting you want to rob a
bank now I ask you this how is it possible that 
half of the country could be convinced that the  
word find meant doe a crime but only in this 
one phone call and doesn't mean it anywhere  
else how was that done easily you watched videos 
of Derek schauen not murdering anybody and people  
were convinced they saw him being murdered it's 
real easy it turns out you can convince half  
the country of actually anything anything half 
the country still thinks they have free speech  
quite obviously you don't quite obviously that 
went away a long time ago do they still see it  
yeah you can make people believe they see 
anything now here's a question that's been  
bugging me lately because uh sometimes I'll 
find myself getting into a you could call it  
a debate but to me it's more like a diagnosis in 
which somebody will make wild TDS related claims  
about Trump they're just clearly debunked just 
like the most debunked obviously not true stuff  
and I will sometimes say all right here's 
a situation where you should just trust me  
on this not because of my political opinion 
because you could disagree on that but you  
should trust that I'm an expert on identifying 
somebody who's in cognitive dissonance and is  
is suffering from brainwash that's actually 
my my area of you know special interest and  
expertise and so I'm telling you Dear Sir that 
although you think you're operating under logic  
nothing you're saying right now makes sense 
you're normally actually a logical reasonable  
person but on this one topic you've departed 
from your normal IQ and reasonableness and I  
as an expert someone who you know knows what 
a hypnotized person looks like I'm telling you  
that it's very obvious you're operating from 
a brainwashed uh COG nitive dissonance kind  
of a situation and that there's no actual debate 
happening here do you know how that how that goes
over usually I get insulted and and you know 
turned away yeah because people once they  
realize they have a medical problem which it is 
in my mind in my mind that's a medical problem if  
you have TDS it's like any other uh emotional 
or psychological phenomenon if it's affecting  
your life and it clearly does for a lot of people 
that's a medical problem so I keep finding myself  
in situations where the other person thinks 
they're having a debate this happened to me  
yesterday actually that my my Democrat friend 
believed he was having a debate and I thought  
to myself there's no debate you're having some 
kind of a weird psychological phenomenon and  
I'm telling you I'm telling you you're having a 
psychological problem you think you're having a  
debate there's nothing like that happening all 
right anyway believe hypnotists when they tell  
you you're hypnotized um Scott Ritter you all 
are you familiar with that name Scott Ritter  
he was famous as a weapon of mass destruction 
uh guy looking for looking for those in the  
Iraq yeah use a weapons ins Spector but now he 
talks mostly about uh how Russia is definitely  
going to win in Ukraine and we don't realize it 
which makes him look like a Russian propagandist  
now many people would say he he's just a Russian 
propagandist well now he's talking about I will  
just say he looks exactly like one that's all 
I know right yeah he works for Russia Today he  
writes for the Russian newspaper basically so 
yes all indications and my personal observation  
all indications are that um you know he's working 
for the other team I don't know that for sure I  
would just say he presents himself in every way 
like somebody who's on another team um but he's  
saying that Israel will lose if it goes into 
Gaza and that the Israeli military is actually  
not very good um there are just some units like 
Special Forces who are very good but if you look  
at the general Army um not really that strong he 
says that Hezbollah would beat them straight up  
if Hezbollah went after Israel it would just 
destroy the Israeli military I don't believe  
that that that doesn't sound real to me but I'm 
just telling you what he's saying in public okay  
um I also don't believe that Israel is so dumb 
that they would go into Gaza with a traditional  
um traditional Urban Warfare I I feel like that 
would be stupid and they're no matter what the  
quality of their military is they're not stupid to 
me it would just be stupid to go door to door and  
you know be booby trapped to death why would 
they do that I think they will just destroy  
everything as they go and just stay behind the 
line of Destruction and and just shrink shrink  
the real estate that the bad guys can be in until 
they just control them and then you know drop them  
other all bombs in the middle and be done with it 
I don't think they're going to be knocking on any  
doors now when I say any of course there will be 
some but I think one of the reasons that they're  
waiting is that they never imp plan to they never 
plan to go fast in the first place that's my guess  
right because remember military operations are 
all about deception my guess is they did not plan  
to go in already it looks like from the outside 
it looks like maybe public opinion and something  
about negotiating for the hostages is delaying 
here's what I predict a whole bunch of delays  
for different reasons uh well well we'll give you 
a couple more days because we're negotiating some  
more releases uh well we're we're waiting for 
a couple assets to show up before we go in oh  
well we we thought we'd do some some more training 
about how to go in just get everybody sharp before  
we go in I feel like it's not going to happen 
they're definitely going to control Gaza they're  
definitely going to eliminate Hamas well I don't 
think it's going to be in the most traditional  
way that we expect them to do it I think it'll be 
clever and I think everything we've seen so far  
is part of that cleverness I don't think think 
is just being slow now I could be completely  
wrong by the end of today if they go in hard and 
traditionally then I'm completely wrong and uh  
you get to tell me that tomorrow okay now remember 
I have gotten these military things wrong I said  
I said Putin wouldn't wouldn't go into Ukraine 
because it would be such a such a bad idea well I  
was right that it was a bad idea on some level you 
know Putin might still come out ahead so I guess  
it' be good on that level but I didn't think he 
could take ke so at least I was right about that  
all right um Germany apparently has uh big pramas 
gatherings um some are saying that the German news  
are running a blackout so that the public is 
not aware how how big it is someone else said  
that they just landed in Germany the other day 
and they're now seeing a whole bunch of problems  
so maybe the news maybe our news is exaggerating 
it maybe Germany is downplaying it hard to know  
basically you can't believe anything at this 
point but um as other people have said and I  
agree I'm pretty sure Europe is lost in the sense 
that um I think it will go uh Islamic and probably  
radical so I think Germany will be lost entirely 
is my guess and uh I blame Hitler I blame Hitler  
because do you think that Germany would have been 
so pro-immigration if they didn't have the legacy  
of trying to let's say make things right for the 
Hitler era I think this is literally the the last  
play of Hitler to destroy the country they they 
had such overwhelming guilt uh or maybe it was  
public relations in part but they basically uh 
painted themselves in a corner the end result is  
they either have to well I'll just say it directly 
they either have to recreate Hitler or they lose  
and I think they're going to choose losing I 
don't think they're going to recreate Hitler  
meaning that they would have to get rid of the 
immigrants based primarily on their demographic  
I can't imagine that happening you're writing 
a new book called blame Hitler you know quoting  
Norm McDonald the more I find out about Hiller 
the more I don't like him it's a nor McDonald
joke all right well did you see the Scandal about 
Greta tberg and the octopus so Greta posed for a  
picture with some other Pro Palestinian people 
in support of the Palestinian people but she  
made the mistake of um if it was a mistake of 
having a little toy octopus uh with her by her  
shoulder and I learned this yesterday I I was 
not aware that an octopus is an anti-semitic  
symbol because apparently there's some images 
of the plan planet Earth with what some would  
call the Jewish octopus strangling the Earth i' 
never I've never seen that before so I learned  
yesterday that if you put an octopus in your photo 
don't talk about Israel or the Palestinians you  
know octopus is okay talking about the Middle 
East fine but don't do them both no octopus  
plus Middle East you will be blamed for being 
an anti-semitic now I think she said it's a  
St it's a toy that people who have trouble with 
their emotions have which you can turn it inside  
out and it Smiles but you turn it the other 
way and it frowns it's a way for people who  
are not good at expressing their emotions to 
Signal what their mood is in case people can't
tell does that sound
likely that you buying that here's what I think I  
think Greta is way way way 
too smart to have done it
intentionally because it wouldn't have 
helped her cause would it yeah no now no  
matter what you think of her opinions on 
climate change she's at least smart would  
you give me that would you give me that 
she's smart she's she likes attention  
but she's smart I don't think anybody 
smart would put a a a known antiemetic  
symbol in a photo unless she was going to 
fully commit to being anti-semetic nobody  
nobody does that while trying to maintain 
a non- anti-semitic image nobody would do
that how many of you think 
she did it intentionally
and I you have to pass the really test 
really really now it doesn't really T it  
doesn't pass the really test all right 
for those of you who think she did it
intentionally I'm a hypnotist and I'm telling you 
that you're suffering from something right now  
there there isn't any chance it was intentional 
there really wasn't there was no chance that was
intentional I think you you have to check your 
bias if you think that was intentional now here  
here's my argument my argument goes like this 
number one I'm a hypnotist and so I can recognize  
when you're operating irrationally there's nobody 
with her um capabilities who would think that was  
anything except the worst idea anybody had to 
put a known anti-semitic symbol in her photo  
nobody ever would do that even if even if she's 
anti-semitic which I have no evidence to suggest  
she is even if she is no she would not do that 
now if you say but you know Elon Omar might do  
it well sure well sure that's not really the 
same thing is it yeah she's a pawn she may  
be a pawn but she's not stupid nobody in the 
world would put a known anti-semitic symbol  
in a public photo that was intended to be a 
public photo nobody ever ever unless that was  
their brand and they were trying to tell you that 
that's who they were she's obviously not doing
that
what if she didn't know I assume she 
didn't know yeah I just assume she didn't
know she does what she's been told to do well 
maybe somebody I I mean I would certainly believe  
that somebody tried to tricker if somebody tried 
to tricker that would be just sort of ordinary to  
me I would say oh okay that makes sense somebody 
just put it there or or somebody saw it and did  
know it meaning Maybe one of the friends and 
said hey you know it would be funny you should  
put your octopus in there it's possible it was a 
trick but no I don't believe there's any chance  
that she intended it that way none and and and 
can we acknowledge that I'm not a supporter of  
Greta I think she's I think she's a malign very 
dangerous force in the world I think she's very  
dangerous so I'm not on her side right it would 
be easy easy for me to easy for me to be against  
her because I oppose her on some other topic 
but this time no now I got I gotta I gotta  
go against the fake news on this one David Sachs 
interestingly uh posted some thoughts by Patrick  
Buchanan now passed away but famous a famous very 
provocative and controversial uh Republican and  
here's something that he wrote in one of his books 
before he passed Patrick yanan he said at the  
opening of the 20th century there were five Great 
Western Empires the British French Russian German  
and austro Hungarian and two emerging great Powers 
Japan and the United States by centuries end all  
the empires had disappeared how did they perish 
by War all of them so Patrick Buchanan points  
out that the only reason that America survived as 
the sole superpower is that we had a geographic  
advantage and we stayed out of the the big land 
Wars and that was it like there wasn't anything  
else special about us compared to Europe except 
we stayed n of the wars and it basically explains  
everything else why do we do so well economically 
Etc and here we are uh putting ourselves into one  
and maybe two land Wars so that's a cautionary 
Tale it does seem like we were going to spend  
ourselves into Oblivion so if we became not a 
superpower that would be a big reason why just  
supporting Wars all right well there's another 
accusation from comr and the Republicans about  
the Biden so-called Biden crime crime family so 
they have in their possession the Republicans  
do a copy of a $2,000 check that Joe Biden's 
brother James uh gave him now it's allegedly uh a
loone uh received a loan for the exact 
amount that James Biden had just gotten  
some money for so there's there's 
a speculation or assumption wait  
Buchanan is still alive that can't be 
really why do I so clearly remember him
dying huh that's a fake memory wow that's cool 
if you ever have if you ever have the experience  
of having a fake memory like I am having right 
now because I I very specifically remember him  
dying but I'll take your word for it that he's 
alive so so I'm having like a fake memory of  
like a really clean one really clean memory of 
it like I remember as specifically and I guess  
it didn't happen so when this happens here's what 
you should do you should do what I'm doing right  
now you should first of all Marvel in it that 
you could have a complete memory of a thing that  
didn't happen and the second thing you could do 
is ask yourself how often that's happening and you  
didn't know it if I had not looked up I would have 
finished this still thinking he was dead right so  
it's only a coincidence that I happen the oh maybe 
it was Pat Robertson maybe that's what I confused
yeah James Buchanan is dead okay wise ass anyway 
so back to this Biden story uh so comr thinks he  
might have the goods that would show a money flow 
money flow um and uh am I still alive but I didn't  
see it to me The Coincidence of the 200,000 that 
went to Joe Biden which is the same day that the  
brother got 200,000 for something uh it could be 
exactly what it looks like a illegal payment for  
influence of some kind it could just as easily 
be that the brother owed him some money or he  
needed a loan and he just passed on the money 
that he just got because it was free cash that  
had not been invested anywhere else so I would 
say it's it's well short yeah the same amount  
because if somebody said I mean you imagine 
a family situation your brother says you know  
I'm in a bind I need $200,000 I'm not saying 
this is what happened I'm just broadening your  
imagination let's say somebody said uh you know 
I need $300,000 and then your brother says well  
I just got 200 in cash my other stuff is invested 
but I'll tell you what I'll just give this 200 to  
you you can figure out how to pay off the hund 
other hundred in other ways and then let me know  
when you're when you can pay it back maybe so the 
thing is unless you hear the other side of the  
story um you could have all kinds of suspicions 
as we did I mean it would be obviously right to  
be suspicious um but it's not it's not quite 
it's like the gun has steam coming off it but  
not smoke it might be telling us something but it 
also might not and you know what I say about that  
I've got a famous saying I say in these situations 
innocent until proven guilty because both James  
Biden and Joe Biden are individuals and even Joe 
Biden is innocent until proven guilty and I don't  
call this proof I call this an indication of you 
ought to look into it maybe it would be enough for  
an indictment you know on in some world that 
would be enough uh but certainly no proof of  
illegality but fun news fun to look at all right 
let me check in with the folks who amazingly  
there's still folks on the other platform who are 
just looking at my whiteboard and still chatting
