good morning everybody and welcome to
yeah you know you know what i'm gonna
say
and it's true every time it's the best
thing that's ever happened to you right
now it's called coffee with scott adams
the live stream that defines quality in
all the other live streams the only live
stream where the odds of me blowing my
nose in front of the audience
always a good 37 likelihood so that's
the kind of
professionalism i bring to this and it
causes everybody else to play catch-up i
know
how would you like to have the
simultaneous sip
anybody anybody let's have a
simultaneous sip and um
it's the first time this morning
i'll be doing a sip with anybody
yeah so this will be the first one of
the day
and it's called the simultaneous step
and all you need is a couple of micro
glass a tiger chelsea style canteen
jugger flask of the vessel of any kind
filling with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better watch
what it does to your antibodies which is
watch this go
hold on hold on
hold on
most of my antibodies just came online
some of them did not
we're going to need to do a second
augmented
sip here
go
checking all good we're online
i don't know what it was some kind of a
vaccination mandate
sick out or something but my antibodies
were not going online all at the same
time but it's all good now we're all
good
well kovit is killing 1200 people per
day still in the united states allegedly
if we're counting them correctly and the
ers are packed
that's the news
apparently we have some kind of a
plateau things were dropping like crazy
and then we hit a plateau
that plateau is probably
say some experts
to do with not seasonality exactly but
indoor living
now here's here's a new clue
for this pandemic and i don't know that
i exactly had
processed this before it's something
i've heard of but i hadn't quite put it
together
it goes like this
your normal flu
has seasonality
right when the summer comes the flu
pretty much gets knocked out if it's the
seasonal flu
but the the coronavirus and the delta
have seemed to have a different pattern
which is that
they respond to indoor living
regardless of the season
so apparently it's not enough to simply
be outdoors in the summer and indoors in
the winter
if it's florida in the summer people go
indoors and they get covered
and in other places in the winter they
go indoors and get covered but why
doesn't that work with a regular flu
why does the regular flu
which presumably is also worse indoors
right does anybody doubt that
nobody doubts that the regular flu is
also worse indoors but why does a
regular flu still still
still succumb to seasonality
when this one doesn't
is it just you know more aggressive is
that all it is
is it's just a matter of degree
right
so some are saying it's the aerosol
versus
contact on surfaces i guess would be the
other way
somebody says not weaponized i like your
thinking yeah the gain of function might
be what does that but
let's do a little
a little critical thinking
is there anything we can learn from the
fact
that there that the regular flu
um
succumbs to seasonality and this one
doesn't
aside from the fact it's more aggressive
maybe that's the whole story it's just
more aggressive
but here's a question
i'm just going to put that out put it
out here this is a thought experiment
and not something that anybody will ever
do
suppose we had a rule
that said that if more than
i'll just pick a number if more than
three people are going to be in a room
for more than 10 minutes
and again i'm just making this up for
for conversation purposes you have to
open a window
even if it's winter
you have to open a window otherwise you
just can't be three people in a small
room together
could you get rid of the coronavirus in
two weeks
because i've got a feeling if we could
study
how many times people got an infection
in a room that had a window open
what do you think i feel as if opening a
window
takes your odds of getting the
coronavirus from
pretty good to maybe hardly ever
don't you think
i don't know if there's any way to study
that but if you can study
is indoors with the window open
going to protect you completely just
just like being outdoors being outdoors
seems to protect you almost completely
and remember my other hypothesis that
fans
might be enough to keep you safe indoors
what if you said you you can't have a
gathering of more than three people
unless the fan is on
turn the fan on and the fan would just
be to
disperse
whatever's in the air so that even if
you were infected it'd be so such a
small load
as opposed to a big plume
you know you don't want to stand in a
plume of covet
but if you were in a room where there
was just like trace amounts floating
around you'd probably be fine
i'll bet you
so so here's a bet it's easy bet because
we'll never do it
we'll never find out i'll make a bet
that if you had a rule and people
followed it of course they wouldn't but
if you could
that you shouldn't have more than three
people in the room for more than 10
minutes without a fan on or let's say
ceiling fan or any kind of a fan or a
window open
something like that um
i'll bet it would end the pandemic
we'll never know
elon musk
decided to sell uh 5 billion worth of
his stock
some say it's because he needed some
cash to pay some
some tax liabilities from some stock
options he exercised or something i
don't know the details but it seems
related to
please stop what
steve
what
are you telling me to please stop the
topic
uh
because i'm gonna
pop you off the channel here
i don't like that kind of comment
all right uh elon musk
here's the best part of the story elon
musk doesn't do anything boring
i don't know how he does it
but he can't he's somehow genetically
uh designed where he just can't do
boring things
i don't i don't know if he knows how
and so instead of just selling some
stock and paying his taxes like some
quiet billionaire might he does a
twitter poll
and then tells people that he'll follow
whatever the twitter poll says
now the funny thing is that there's
nothing less scientific than a twitter
poll
i mean really that's just ridiculous
so here's a guy who's going to make
multi-billion dollar decisions based on
a twitter poll
that is just
the best
that's just the best
it's impossible for him to be boring
he somehow he made the most boring thing
i'm going to pay my taxes
into exciting because it turned into a
twitter poll that wasn't scientific
so i guess that the poll said he should
sell some stock
uh he was talking about 10 of his
holdings but he sold 5 billion worth and
it looks like he actually is doing what
the twitter poll said
and tesla stock is up today somebody
says
anyway there's not much meat to that
story it's just that everything he does
is interesting
um here's some fake news fake news on
fox news
how many of you think that fox news
sometimes has some fake news
anybody think that
because mostly we make fun of cnn and
msnbc
but here's some uh
fake news now of course i'm using my
definition of fake news
okay
so this is my personal definition of
fake news and it includes
this tell
if somebody gives you the news with a
percentage
say this was a x percentage of something
but they don't give you the raw numbers
it's fake news
and also the reverse if they give you
raw numbers for a story
but the percentages would tell you more
it's fake news
so anytime you see a story that's only
the wrong numbers or only the
percentages it is intended as a
manipulation
so here's how
the fake news on fox news by uh piler or
pillar piler arias
so this is not not an opinion piece it's
a news piece on the fox news site
and it talks about one california school
board is rejecting the mandates for kids
to get vaccinated and
as part of the context for this story
the data has shown that 24 percent of
cova cases were kids
is that news
or fake news 24
of kova cases lately have been kids
news or fake news
let's say it's true
so i'm not saying it's untrue
but is it news or fake news it's fake
news
it's fake news because the context is
clearly intentionally omitted
what would be the context
zero deaths
right
the context would be
and zero deaths now it's probably not
zero it might be one or two whatever it
is but the number of deaths
is pretty important to the story isn't
it
because otherwise you're vaccinating the
kids to save other people
is it ethical
to vaccinate kids to save other people
i suppose it would depend how many other
people were at risk
if it was all of them
maybe yes
you know if like every adult would die
unless kids were vaccinated well yeah i
guess maybe in that case you would
vaccinate them
because kids would need living adults to
take care of them too right
but
this is clearly just fake news because
the context is
clearly intentionally left out all right
how many of you would like to see my
kamala harris impression
anybody anybody
because she's in the news she was at a
crt meeting
and apparently uh she was talking to
some folks and there was a viral video
of her talking
now
before i give you my kamla harris
impression
i would like to show you how an actual
uh a real person would talk in public
so here's how a real person would talk
they might talk with their hands
for example they might say you know this
or that or you know you see people
talking like this and like this and like
this
that's how a normal person talks
if you're kamala harris you uh you
pattern your body language
after the police officer from young
frankenstein
you ever seen the movie
i mean if you've seen the movie that's
pretty funny
all right so
to do your kamala harris impression
we'll we'll adjust things i've got to
stand up for this
you need it
hell hello
technical difficulty over here
what the hell
i say again nobody's ever made a com a
stand for a monitor that isn't
shitty
number one
you need
uh an unstylish uh blazer
so i can use a man's jacket because
well trust me it's gonna work
all right
so you put on the unstylish kamala
harris jacket
now when she appears in public she also
wears a mask
so you put the mask on
and then
because
i don't have a wig
so i'm gonna cheat a little bit
by taking off my glasses
there you go
um if you can't see the top
kamla harris and now here's kamala
harris
talking i'll add some dialogue of my own
because what she says is usually
babbling nonsense
but watch the body language
so
if you have the critical
race
theory
what you do is you've got a plan
a plan and then you execute the plan
and then you
execute the plan and then everything is
fine
it doesn't matter what i'm saying just
watch my hands
i'm not nervous
i feel very comfortable talking in
public
[Music]
impressions will
all right
uh the u.s is third in math performance
according to a international competition
does that sound right to you
was that right that america would be
third in math competition
china's first russian second
how do you think they measured this
lost a microphone
i'll bet that's better
all right
here's my problem with comparing
uh math performance across countries
if you're the best math student in china
do you think you have a choice
about being in a math competition
what do you think
you're the best math student in china
does china say to you hey do you want to
be in a math competition or does china
say
you're in a math competition
now take the united states
if you're great at math
and you're 17 or 18
in the united states and they say to you
you know there's an international math
competition what do you say in the
united states
well i might be interested but i just
launched a unicorn startup
and
it's
it's going to go public in a week for
10 billion
so i might miss the contest
here's the thing
i don't think a competition tells you
anything
because all you're really finding out is
that the people who are in the
competition how they did it's not really
telling anything about the home country
i don't think
except that some might be coercive
um
so don't trust that i would love to see
a if there's any way to do it the top
one percent of math students in each
country
and just see how they compare
because it doesn't really matter if
everybody else is good at math because
we don't use it that much i mean
sometimes i'll use a little algebra
believe it or not sometimes every now
and then it comes in handy but not often
and if i had to have a workaround i
probably could
so
anyway
we teach math to too many people who
will never use it i think it's a waste
of time
and so i would say 80 percent of math
education
the higher level education in my opinion
is completely waste of time
but is certainly useful for the top say
10 percent of students
and certainly everybody should learn at
least algebra
i think at least algebra
but maybe maybe that's about it
all right here's some fake news on from
cnn
now this isn't an opinion piece by
michael d'antonio so the opinion pieces
are a different standard right because
it's opinion but
it's on a new site and i don't think cnn
would allow an opinion
on a new site their new site unless the
facts and alleged in the piece were also
facts that cnn says are facts would you
agree with that
even though it's an opinion piece
the editors aren't going to put it on
cnn's page unless the factual claims are
actually accurate according to them
so here's a factual claim by michael
d'antoni on cnn
on their website
he says
i'll skip that part he talked he talks
about a well-documented
and objective truth
of trump's election defeat
uh so he says there's a well-documented
and objective truth
of his election defeat
is that a fact
that is well documented
and objectively true
no
it's objectively true that no court has
ruled that there was a
substantial fraud
not looking for something isn't the same
as not not being there the courts don't
look for fraud they only judge what's
brought to them in most cases they
didn't have the the standing or the
jurisdiction to even rule on it
so basically not no fraud was really
looked at in any serious way the audits
looked at the obvious stuff but they
can't audit everything
including the electronic stuff
so yeah that's just fake news
uh but uh cnn uh readers would not know
the difference
i've told you many times that our
opinions are assigned to us
but it's hard to see it right
because you think your opinions come
from some internal process
there are only a few situations
in which it's really obvious
that your opinions were assigned to you
and i'm going to give you one of those
now i'm not talking about you
necessarily right
so this doesn't mean you specifically
but the public
has an opinion a collective opinion both
left and right
right this this one won't even be much
difference left or right this is an
assigned opinion and when you hear it
you're going to know it right away but
it was invisible until i mentioned it
watch this
if christopher steele of the famous
steele dossier had been an ex-russian
spy instead of an ex-british spy
would we say that he was part of russian
interference
if christopher steele
had been an ex-rush spy
would we say that putin was involved
yes
yes 100
and why would we say that
if christopher steele and this
hypothetical
if he was operating independently and he
was no longer working for an
intelligence agency maybe he didn't even
live in the country didn't even live in
russia
would you say well that doesn't count
because he's independent now and
he's ex you know he's not he's not part
of the intelligence he used to be but
now he isn't so would you say oh okay
that's a distinction that matters
so we won't say that putin's behind it
because he's not really working for
putin anymore
but
he's an ex-british spy
and yet
both the left and the right
believes that an ex-british spy
has no connection back to his home
country and intelligence agencies
but you wouldn't believe that if you
were an ex-russian spy would you
here's why you would never be able to
come up with this opinion on your own
this is how you know it's an assigned
opinion
nobody would come up with this opinion
on their own
if you heard he was x
uh
m6 is it x british intelligence you
would say to yourself quite reasonably
there's no such thing as
ex-british intelligence
right
you would never say to yourself there's
such a thing as an ex-spy
because there isn't there are definitely
people who are not on the payroll
and they're definitely people who are
not
taking orders from you know their old
bosses that's true
but if he if he's about to do something
that has international repercussions at
the very highest level
he checked with his old boss
[Laughter]
let me say that with
complete confidence i mean i don't know
i don't have facts to back it up right
but do you think there's any chance
he didn't check it with the home office
first
even though he doesn't work there he's
an ex-spy doesn't owe them anything
but you don't think he checked with them
first
really
because if he were russian you'd be sure
he did you'd be sure he did
but because he's british
our press just ignores it
and because it's ignored you don't come
to the conclusion that he was actively
involved
with great britain in trying to
interfere with the elections
this is an opinion that nobody would
come to on their own
and yet both left and right came to this
opinion that the great britain is not
really involved in an interference
do you see it
am i wrong that once i point it out you
can see that this is an assigned opinion
nobody came to this opinion on their own
now some of you
and i could see it in the comments
some of you were there all along saying
wait a minute there's no such thing as
an ex-spy exactly
you know you you can never be completely
axed
right yeah it is a good example isn't it
this one will bother you if you think
about it because if you if you had never
once
thought wait a minute great britain
definitely interfered with the election
if you've never had that thought once
then you you accepted an assigned
opinion
uncritically
all right
um
see what else is going on uh i love the
fact that the new revelations about
[Music]
hello
hello
my potential spam doesn't want to talk
to me
okay
i thought that was gonna be fun
um
so what's funny is that now that we know
that the steele dossier was uh
at least coordinating with the
democratic
campaign for hillary clinton now that we
know that
and clearly this is worse than watergate
by a lot
by like a factor of 100 it's not even
close
where's carl bernstein
the guy that cnn trots out to say that
anything that trump did was worse than
the watergate
they can't bring him on tv anymore
the funniest thing about this is that
he's got to be completely shut out
he's probably in hiding
literally
you need to i'll bet you i'll bet you a
uh
that no journalist can find him right
now
i'll bet he's literally off the grid
somewhere not answering questions
because there's no way he's not going to
be asked if this is worse than watergate
and what the hell is he going to say
you're starting to sound like carl
bernstein
baby
all right uh
jeffrey toobin of course is in the news
now i've defended him
uh
getting his job back because i think he
just you know made it made a dumb
mistake and that's not really the reason
you should fire people
uh it was just a funny mistake that
however does not let him off the hook
because when you do something that funny
i'm gonna have some fun with it so i
totally uh support him getting his job
back
but
uh um
i'm just going to say i'll just
summarize what he said in his commentary
this is this is my summer summarization
so don't don't blame him for the wording
but
uh tuban thinks that ridden house is a
jerk so part of his commentary is that
ridden house was really really dumb to
bring a gun to where he did
so tuban thinks rittenhouse is a jerk
but also that ridden house's lawyers
might get the jerk off
anything anybody
anything
all right that's all i had in that
rasmussen has a poll that says 55 of the
public surveyed i think these are likely
voters usually oppose mandatory
vaccinations for kids
and 35 percent are in favor
55 oppose mandatory vaccinations
what percentage of the country has to
oppose anything
before you can be sure it won't happen
what percentage i feel like it's about
75.
it's not 55
definitely not 55.
somebody saying 70 maybe
it depends on the topic probably but i
think he needs 70 75 before
before the public's in control
now you remember i i often remind you
um
no i didn't steal that joke from gotfeld
but
uh we we do have a similar sense of
humor so i wouldn't be surprised if he
if he had a similar joke
um
i think 70 70 75 is is when the
the public
simply takes control
at 55 percent i think we do throw it to
the government and say ah we can't
decide
you decide and then we we live with it
because it's better to have a system
that works
than to get everything you want every
time
so
um that 55 is going to have to get
bigger so convince your fellow citizens
don't convince the government because
the government's not going to change its
mind at 55
china is continues to be
not safe for business
[Laughter]
uh greg guffeld just uh texted me
uh to to say that uh that wasn't his
joke
he says he's mad he didn't come up with
it
so i guess greg is watching hi greg
um
anyway uh
there's a new coveted policy in shenyang
china i learned about this in an ian
bremmer tweet
uh by the way you should follow ian
bremmer um
you would be one of the i don't know
20 people on twitter that say useful
good things that you wish you wish you
knew
so follow ianbrenner on twitter
um but here's the new china covent
policy all visitors are quarantined for
28 days in the hotel so for 28 days you
don't have any human contact
up close
you get tested seven times during that
period and if all clear you have to go
self quarantined at home for another
month
so so 28 days at a hotel quarantined
followed by a month quarantine a home
quarantining a home
uh
that's 56 days of isolation
56 days
just to visit china
now that's pretty serious
uh
but it's also one more reason not to go
to china in case you needed any so
anybody who's still doing business in
china unless you have existing business
there which i would understand
uh
you need to
need to you need to think about getting
out of china well michael malus if you
don't follow him you should he's another
great follow on twitter
had this great tweet today he said
blue-pilled people
use language as a way to avoid thought
their cognitive process is entirely
different they use phrases delivered to
them by the corporate press to close off
thoughts that were that where a critical
mind would otherwise go akin to sewing
up a hole in clothes
and i do believe that's pretty much
there now i call that word thinking
where you use words
that sound right to replace any critical
thinking
but yeah they do use language as a
replacement for critical thought that's
actually true
it's a good good uh
good observation uh all right so let's
talk about kyle rittenhouse um
this this that trial is really
interesting
and not for good reasons it's
interesting in all the wrong ways
for example today there's a hashtag
trending kyle rittenhouse is guilty
what
kyle rittenhouse is guilty
the entire trial is about having no
evidence
no evidence of any crime has been
been even presented
no evidence that looks like any evidence
really
um
so there are people who could watch this
and still think he's guilty
of what
bad judgment that's not a crime
so
i would like to say this number one
this is something they should not have
retreated to
political sides it shouldn't have but of
course everything does
however i would like to propose this
thought experiment
if kyle written house had been let's say
identified as a typical leftist
who had also used a gun to kill somebody
in what looked like self-defense
would the right
be just taking sides and saying oh it's
a leftist so they're guilty
or would the people on the right the
pro-gun people
say no it doesn't matter who does it
it's self-defense
because i think the right
would have stuck with stuck with
principle
am i wrong about that
now i i do think the left and the right
are equally guilty of just you know
going to their side and saying oh my
side is the side your side is outside
and just ignoring the facts otherwise
you know what team are you on but i feel
like
the right
would not have teamed on this one
because they're sort of team gone aren't
they
i think the right is more team gun than
they are team republican am i right
and and the gun information about this
just like the alec baldwin story
um
the gun stuff is absolute
and it should be
and i've had this conversation with
you know at least one person about the
alec baldwin thing i think it applies
here
gun mentality
runs as an absolute because it has to be
right
self-defense is an absolute defense it's
not a partial defense
it's an absolute defense
gun responsibility
is an absolute
if the gun's in your hand
you're
you're responsible
i don't care who you delegated it to
the fact that you delegated that
responsibility to your armorer
is irrelevant
if it's in your hand right so that's the
that's the way the gun people think of
absolutes that's that's my impression
anyway and again this is just purely
subjective
but i feel like the the right would not
have taken teams on this except team gun
to
to support the absolute nature of some
of these things
all right uh
i i asked a uh a question that was just
a thought experiment obviously this
can't and shouldn't happen
but if somehow kyle uh written house got
a gun on the witness stand and
shot the prosecutor in the middle of the
trial would it be self-defense
would it be self-defense
now what's your first thought well no
you can't shoot somebody during a trial
and certainly if this prosecutor were a
normal prosecutor making a case
with no lies and no exaggerations just
making their case i was saying no
there's no there's nothing going on here
except a fair trial
it's of course it's an adversarial
process you're not going to like what
the other team says but that's not
that's not a reason for killing somebody
that's the system working just the way
the system is supposed to work
but is that what's happening
here it's not what i'm seeing
what i'm seeing is somebody murdering
an innocent man in front of us
that's what i see
because if you don't think that what is
happening to kyle rittenhouse's brain
is not grievous harm
well then you don't know anything about
anything
kylo ren house is suffering at the
moment grievous physical harm
now the physical part is the physical
part of his brain
but his brain is being permanently
reprogrammed into a negativity into ptsd
he probably already has it
but what is happening now is the height
of criminal behavior
there is somebody being grievously
harmed right in front of us without
reason without cause
because if he had evidence that kyle
rittenhouse was a criminal
then i'd say well you got to do what you
got to do
but since the evidence clearly shows
he's not
the continued torturing and dismantled
of this young man's brain
right in front of us
looks like a crime to me
and while i don't know how i would rule
if i run the jury
i'm pretty sure i wouldn't care if he
stood up and shot the prosecutor again
i'm not in favor of violence
which is just a thought experience
experiment nobody should shoot anybody
don't do any violence okay
but in terms of would it be justifiable
i think yes
it would be very unwise and i wouldn't
want to see any kind of trend like that
but would it be justifiable to shoot
this specific prosecutor in this
specific situation and i say yes
i say yes
i think that what he's doing the
prosecutor rises to a level of grievous
bodily harm
and that is
it's witnessable
we're watching it
right now right in front of us
jeanette says we're you're losing me
here well remember it's a thought
experiment so no nobody's arguing he
should actually do it okay
joe biden uh i guess during the campaign
called
kyle rittenhouse a white supremacist
which is backed by zero evidence there
is zero evidence of anything like that
can joe biden be sued
for calling him a white supremacist i
don't know the answer
probably not as a sitting president but
can he be sued after he's out of office
i would say yes right
to me that feels like a slam dunk
how in the world can you lose that case
because the evidence that he said it is
clear
the evidence that there was no evidence
for it is clear
right
and uh he did it for
malicious purposes which was to win an
election
uh by maligning some innocent guy
so but also i wonder if it's impeachable
i'd ask him the same question again and
see if he'd deny it
somebody needs to ask joe biden
if he uh if he disavows his prior
comment about kyle being a white
supremacist
because
if he doesn't disavow it
i think that's impeachable
am i wrong i mean i don't know if it
meets these standards specifically of
impeachability but if the president of
the united states targets a citizen who
is objectively and obviously innocent of
the charges
i feel like
some kind of crime is involved if not a
crime at least impeachability so
somebody used to ask him
peter ducey get on that
um
all right i still say that the crime of
the century
is one that nobody's calling a crime
except me as far as i know
is whatever happened with the rapid test
strip approvals in this country now
before i talk about rapid
test strip approval i my understanding
is there are a lot of people who don't
understand
why rapid tests which are somewhat less
sensitive than the normal tests why we
would have less sensitive tests at all
in the end because you get you know
false false readings now and then and
the answer is that they would catch
pretty much all of these super spreaders
if they were people who didn't have
symptoms if you have symptoms you go get
the good test
right everybody understands that if you
have coveted symptoms you don't use the
rapid test
you immediately get the real
test if you if you have covered symptoms
and you only use the rapid test
well then you're using the wrong tool
and that would be bad
i'm sure people will do it but that
would be the wrong tool and that would
be bad
but anyway the fact that only one
company got approved quickly i think it
was abbott
and there were other companies you know
begging to get approved that could have
done these things quickly and they
didn't
makes me believe that the only
explanation for that is massive
corruption which could have cost the
lives of hundreds of thousands of
americans
so far
now
i don't know who it is or what
or why any of this happened but i do not
believe that um
incompetence
is why we were delayed
do you
how many of you think that the correct
explanation of why we were delayed so
much and other countries weren't was
incompetence because remember the things
that we didn't approve were were
approved by other big countries that are
also smart
why would that be
can you think of any reason other than
corruption
because i can't
i can't think of any reason other than
corruption
so
my assumption is that there's some
corruption here hiding in plain sight
that is just insane
but let me let me complicate the story a
little bit
as adam dopamine tweeted today
not his real name as far as i know
um
that uh the fda is going to meet on
november 30th to discuss
approving therapeutics you know the
pills i think pfizer has some
therapeutic pills and right now i guess
burroughs welcome has something and
regeneron
now you can get a shot of regeneron that
acts as a therapeutic
or actually a prophylactic
and therapeutic i think um
so so they're going to meet on november
30th what's your first reaction to that
they're going to meet at november 30th
to discuss it
what's your first reaction
they're going to meet on november 30th
to discuss it
here's my first reaction
it's november 11th
and we're in a pandemic
who decided to wait
all that time to talk about the most
important thing that they need to talk
about
is there something more important than
this
what were they doing that was more
important than this
thanksgiving vacation
family leave
this looks like corruption too
because the faster you get therapeutics
the faster the demand for vaccinations
will
will go down because a lot of people are
going to go all joe rogan on this right
they're going to go all uh
they're going to say i don't need the
vaccination because these therapeutics
look good
so i would say that this delay might be
scheduling
it might be incompetence
but in the context of what seems to be
more obvious
probably financially related
crimes or corruption
this delay itself looks like corruption
to me
doesn't it look like corruption to you
because i don't really understand why
you can't do this tomorrow
do you
is there
my understanding is that pfizer has the
data if they're waiting for data then
yes of course
but the data is already out
right
and how long does it take to look at the
data
i guess other people dig in and ask a
lot of questions and stuff
but
i suppose that process might be
happening between now and the 30th and
it's just part of the process
but somehow it in the context of not
trusting them in general
i'm not sure i'm going to automatically
give them the benefit of the doubt on
this
anyway so that's what's going on
um
and
i'll just put this out there
if trump were president
do you think the fda would wait till
november 30th
or would he be kicking their ass
to do it faster if that's possible now
again we don't have enough information
so it could be that you know a bunch of
fda analysts need to study it and it
just takes that long and blah blah but i
have a little
i have a real doubt
that it takes that long to study it
because the only data they have is going
to come from pfizer right
and pfizer's been all over it
and it shouldn't take that long to for
somebody who at least understands how to
look at the numbers to know if
this looks legit or not
okay
so
i think trump would have made that
better and if you and if not we can
imagine that he would have and so i was
asked this provocative question
if
trump's election strategy now we don't
know for sure he's running but i think
he is if his if his election strategy is
is just to stay chill for a while
and a way for the public to beg him to
come back
it's working
if trump's if trump's strategy is just
stay chill
don't don't make a new provocation you
know he's he responds to everything in
the news provocatively but that's okay
because that's just in the news
but
don't come up with something that's
brand new
don't come up with something that's
brand new
and uh
and be provocative about it all he has
to do is hang out because
the
the democrats are doing such a bad job
people are going to beg for him to come
back just to fire people
just to fire people
because at least
we know trump is good at that now trump
was asked on an interview recently
why he didn't fire fouchy
and his answer some people questioned
because his answer was the fouchy part
of his answer it wasn't the whole answer
but part of the answer is that fauci had
been around a long long time
is that a good answer to why didn't you
fire him
what do you think of that answer he's
been around a long long time
all right so um
you know that's not a good answer but
but then there's a mystery right
you know trump has no problems firing
people in general i think you'd all
agree with that he can fire people
well like so that's one thing his
critics would agree with yeah he can
fire people he's a fire
so
do you think he just couldn't fire
fouchy
i think he gave us a hint
and here's the hint
fauci
had such a high credibility partly
because he'd been around so long that
firing him would have made trump look
like the guy who doesn't believe in
science
and believes in hydroxychloroquine
and drinking bleach according to his
critics
so i believe that trump was actually in
a corner
i think that he correctly read the room
which is what he does well by the way
trump will never get the credit he
deserves for how well he reads a room
you know the room being the country in
this case he can read a room
and i'm not sure everybody else can do
that he just has that skill he can read
the room in a small room and he can read
the room in the country and i think he
read the room and he said if i fire the
guy
that 60 of the country thinks is the
smartest guy in the game
i'm going to lose credibility
and i don't think it was a bad thing
that he had a good cop bad cop situation
going on
i don't know that i hated that
did you
when when you see the little uh
divisions maybe between fouchy and trump
at least in terms of how they messaged
and stuff like that
i felt that was a productive tension i
wanted to see that
i wanted to see it play out
so i think that his instinct to not fire
fouchy
was actually well thought out it's hard
to know you know maybe it would have
worked out better if he had we can never
know the future but i feel like
i feel like my instinct would have gone
the same way
i feel like he needed to keep him around
even even to keep him around as a
punching bag
which is what happened basically so even
keeping him around as a scapegoat right
it was probably a good play probably a
good play
so and i think that trump hinted at that
by giving the answer non-answer which is
he's been around a long time that that's
sort of a indirect way to say he has a
lot of credibility so firing him would
be
would be obviously some blowback
so biden is a failure for not firing him
i don't know
you know i have a different opinion
about
fouchy and the experts than most of you
do
and part of it is that um
being wrong is sort of built into their
job
right
we asked these experts to give us you
know a confident opinion about stuff in
a situation that's never happened before
in other words this this specific kind
of pandemic has never happened before so
anything that fauci said was true or
probably true or a prediction
i don't know if he gets that stuff wrong
i think that's just the situation
i think that's the situation more than
the
uh than fouchy i think i think he's in a
situation where being wrong is just sort
of built in
uh
and on youtube some
somebody says scott loves the pandemic
so i saw uh scott gottlieb
um say that he thought the pandemic
would be essentially over in uh january
what do you think do you think the
pandemic will be uh not over but it will
be taking down a pandemic and into
endemic territory just we've got to live
with it
in january does that seem
too soon to you
i feel like that's optimistic but it
depends on the therapeutics
if if in june we can take a pill
that reduces our you know odds of
something by 80 or something
yeah and i think we're endemic at that
point
um
well those of you who say covent is over
keep keep in mind that the uh the ers
are at capacity
and largely because of covid
not totally
so
uh there's still a medical capacity
issue with covet this very real
look to germany
no
i'm not going to look to germany as i
often say leadership will not be the
thing that
was the most predictive here
how to deal with a family member who is
incredibly afraid and has cognitive
dissonance on kovid
yeah i don't know i don't know i i
suppose just giving them context could
help a little bit but
fear is
fear is the best persuader so if
somebody is afraid it's hard to change
their mind
you can't make people less afraid
unless you really really work on them
for a long time and they want to be
they'd have to want to be less afraid
and i don't know if they want to
be um
yeah hospitals are supposed to be near
capacity yeah you're right this might be
a little bit of fake news
because they talked about one hospital
was at 85 or
80 or 85 capacity which my understanding
is that's exactly where you want to be
that's my understanding
staffing defies defines capacity well
largely but not totally
there there definitely is some space
limitation
and equipment limitations
yeah their business model is they
require full hospitals to make money so
so it's a little unclear how much of
this was fake news
um
sophistry you just took both sides what
did i take both sides of
no it's not sophistry when you
you take both sides
showing that there's an argument on both
sides is not sophistry
you know i think that's not i'm going to
add that to my tell for npcs
have you noticed they're just some
things that people always say like oh
that's sophistry
i think that's just an npc thing
you know uh references to the matrix
uh
references to soil and green
references to sophistry
uh i
yeah
i i think that those are all uh just
somebody who doesn't have critical
thinking maybe an npc
and now yeah 1984 right 1984 is another
one of those if that's where you're at
you're probably not part of the the
thinking class
uh
robert says which fda employee worked
for abbott labs
no that's not the right question that's
almost the right question robert the
real question would be who at the fda
was specifically in charge of deciding
which
which rapid tests
are
are evaluated
so i would go a little bit deeper and
find out who specifically was in charge
um
oh
so the simulation i don't think the
simulation falls into the npc category
yet
because that's still sort of new and
unique
so did anybody see uh was it eric
weinstein who went to a group of
economists in chicago
and told them economics
had always been wrong because they were
doing the math wrong
i i'm over summarizing that that's not
exactly what was happening but did
anybody
see the outcome of that
how did how'd it go
was there any kind of uh
resolution
um
eric or brett wasn't it eric
i think it was eric right
uh i think it was like chicago some
economics
group there
all right uh oh it was closed so we
don't know what happened
well that would be interesting i'd love
to hear that because
i definitely would not be surprised if
economics
had been using the wrong math forever
that wouldn't surprise me at all
all right
um but i think i would be very surprised
if he convinced the economist
but uh
there's an antibiotic shortage
uh
you know here's let me give you the
adam's law of slow-moving disasters and
i'm not sure it entirely applies to the
supply
chain problem i think it does now the
supply chain
is was sort of hit us kind of quickly
right so i don't think anybody quite saw
it coming but i would predict that
what we thought was an impossible
situation
that there was so much congestion in the
ports that you couldn't even clear out
the congestion
it was so congested
that literally nothing could happen
like you couldn't even move a crane to
move a you know like basically nothing
could happen it's just it's all just
filled with storage containers
and nothing can move
now that's that's sort of the
exaggerated hyperbolic version of it
but if you bet on people
and i always do
if you bet on people
somebody's figuring it out
meaning that there is some people or
persons at the ports
who are saying you know nobody had this
idea before but what if we do this and
this and
put this together i'll bet you
that
what looks like an unsolvable problem is
being solved while we talk
i'll bet you that smart people
are finding you know maybe they're a b
testing maybe they're just poking around
maybe they've got an out-of-box solution
maybe they've changed the system you
know cleverly
something but i would be surprised if
humans with all of our ingenuity given
the the size of the problem and the
stakes i'd be surprised
if we don't fix this faster than
any kind of common sense would tell you
it could be fixed
my common sense says this is going to be
a long problem
my optimism
is that there will be enough smart
humans
trying enough stuff
that somebody's going to find out what
works and then just do more of it i
think so
so let's keep an eye on that all right
that's all i got for now and i'm going
to go
do some other stuff
there is no is today or tomorrow
veterans day
is it today
today or tomorrow it's today
so i guess uh
tomorrow is a day off for school anyway
so
to the veterans

wow a lot of them
holy cow look at all the veterans
yowzer
a lot of veterans
holy cow
do i have like every veteran in the
world watching this or are there just a
lot of veterans that i don't know about
uh you should uh you should see the
