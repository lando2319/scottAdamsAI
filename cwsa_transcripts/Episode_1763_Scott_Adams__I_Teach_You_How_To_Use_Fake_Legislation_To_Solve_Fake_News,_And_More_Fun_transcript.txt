all right
um
good morning and welcome to the
highlight of civilization it's called
coffee with scott adams it gets better
every time you watch it
every time you consume it in any fashion
whatsoever even if i'm talking at double
speed
i know some of you don't like to hear me
talk slowly
but that's okay
because today we're gonna goose up our
energy with a little caffeine and all
you need is a copper mug or a glass on a
tanker shell steiner canteen jug or
flashlight vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine of the day
and it's the thing that makes everything
better everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
go
ahead
that's good
well
so there are
how many counties do you think there are
in america anybody
just take a guess without looking it up
how many counties
do you think there are in america
the answer is
3143.
so out of the
3143 counties how many of them decided
to go back to a massive mandate for
indoor activities yesterday
how many and a
3143 counties
just one just one yeah
and uh here's the second question
which of those
3143 counties
does scott live in
right so which one does scott live in of
the 3143 campus that's right that's
right it's the same one
yeah
one out of 300
3143 counties
and that's my county
uh-huh yeah
one out of
3143 odds and my number came up
everybody
 everybody
 everybody just everybody
what do i do with that
seriously people
do you believe that i'm not running the
simulation now
i mean
i've been trying to hide it
you know ever since elon and i made an
agreement to run the simulation
i've been telling him can you back off a
little bit it's getting a little bit
obvious you've got the user interface
controls here
richest man in the world a little bit on
the nose a little bit on the nose
and elon's like nobody's going to notice
watch this
i can do anything i want
watch this i will go from
democrat to republican right in front of
you i'm like no
no
you can't do that
that's crazy
if you go from
democrat to republican right in front of
everybody
and your companies are still solvent
when you're done with that
everybody's gonna know you run the
simulation
it's bad enough you're the richest
person in the world
that's obvious that you run the
simulation
but don't
don't do that now that's just like a
magic trick
i mean that's just like you know
turning water into wine or something i
mean come on
be a little bit subtle about it
but it does turn out that everything in
the world only
is only related to me personally and so
the one county that i live in the united
states
decided to have uh mass mandates
so everybody and everything
that's how i feel today
um
i don't think i'll be wearing too many
masks because i just i think i'll just
stay home and ride it out
i just can't handle it anymore i just
can't take the fight anymore like i'm
just going to ride it out this time i
think
well there's a uh
are you noticing that dilbert has moved
into the big pharma
industry
so if you're not following the dilbert
comic because it hasn't been edgy enough
for you lately
well i solved that for you
so i realized that as uh
this week by the way i turned 65
i'd always imagined
really always my whole life
that at age 65 i would definitely be
done with work
one way or another now i'm not the
retirement type so i mean i'm always
going to do something but it'd be more
like optional kind of work
you know i guess this would be like
optional work
i don't have to do it but i like it so
i'd probably do it anyway
um
but i thought
if dilbert is going to ride into
you know obscurity along with me
i might as well take some chances
so dilbert's going to be causing a
little bit more trouble than normal
a little more trouble than normal
so look for that
uh so dilbers company just entered the
big pharma
industry
the cnn
has a story about how the biden
advisors
are not getting along
now are you surprised by that
because that used to be the anonymous
kind of stories you hear all the time
about the the trump administration and i
always tell you
you could pick any presidency
just randomly pick any presidency
and do a story about how the advisors
are not getting along and
they're all pissing and moaning about
what the boss is doing that's just every
group everywhere anywhere there's a
leader that's everyone all the time
i made a comic strip
specifically to highlight that
phenomenon but it doesn't matter where
you are
all the the staff is complaining about
the leaders all the time
so but it is notable when cnn runs a
story about biden having aids that i
guess they're the old school
you know the classic aides who have been
with biden forever who are trying to get
him to do like one
scheduled event
per topic and then nobody cares
so he just doesn't know how to break
through
and i'm thinking to myself
is that bad
the one thing that works for biden is
being invisible
am i right
so cnn it looks like they're trying to
help you know biden somehow by having
these gentle criticisms
uh
i don't know that biden would be better
off communicating more
do you
i think you're better off communicating
more if you're doing good
work am i right
see if you'd agree with this if you're
doing a good job
then communicating more is probably good
because more people will find out you're
doing a good job
if you're helpless or you're doing
nothing is it really good to communicate
more
to show that you have great empathy for
the thing you can't fix
does that really push you ahead you get
a little ahead of that
i don't know i think biden might be the
one
exception to the rule
where even though his
his approvals are in the basement
the only thing that could make it worse
is hearing from
him more
isn't it
seems like it so i think they're playing
it right by keeping him away from the
public
all right here's the funniest story of
the day and i love it when
uh
when the fake news gets their stories
mixed
one of the reasons not to lie was this
uh
mark twain said this maybe tell me who
said this it's a famous quote but one of
the reasons to not lie
is that you don't have to remember all
your stories and keep them straight so
if you meet a new person you don't have
to think okay what who is this person
though
and what stories have i told this
person's friends
i got to be compatible with that version
of the story so that's a real that's a
good reason to not lie
it's just hard to keep it all straight
but it also applies to fake news
what happens if you do two fake news
stories and they uh
they conflict
well
here's one
example
so we know now that uh donald trump jr
during the january 6
protests at the capitol
he uh
he texted at 2 53 p.m so it's right in
the middle of it
he tweeted to mark meadows that the
president
quote he's got to condemn this asap
so in other words donald trump
jr
donald trump jr in the middle of the
protest was trying to get his father to
condemn them and shut them down
do you know what that means
that means that according to cnn
there was a planned insurrection that
the president was somehow part of
and that one of the people who was not
aware of the planned insurrection
was don jr
do you think that their two fake news
stories got
conflicted there
you can't have it both ways
either either it was a planned overthrow
of the country
and an insurrection
and don jr knew about it
or it wasn't the planned insurrection
and that's the reason don jr tried to
close it down immediately as any patriot
would
somebody says purposely kept out really
really you think somebody would do an
insurrection to keep trump in office
and they would try to keep out don jr
from the plan
because what he'd be a i mean none of it
makes sense
so
i was thinking about this concept
of taking one fake news from the fake
news industry and always
comparing it to their other fake news
and if you can find the right pair of
fake news
or the right pair of stories you can
have one debunk the other and this is a
good example
so how can they can how can they
continue with their it was a planned
you know insurrection
without don jr being aware of it
now because the texts you know were
happening in real time
i don't think anybody doubts that the
texts are his real opinion
don jr's opinion that this needs to be
stopped right away
that looked like his real opinion
so
so he says maybe he's lying
really
you think he would be
you know sending a fake tweet to mark
meadows just in case later or something
came up no
that's a little too clever
sometimes the things are exactly what
they look like
exactly what they look like
it looked like there was a
bad situation happening in the capitol
and don jr like most of the world said
hey let's have less of that
and then he sent a text because he could
that's the whole story and then suddenly
it's an insurrection now cnn would also
have us believe the following
that america is the kind of country
that republicans especially will bring
guns to absolutely anything they'll
bring guns to concerts they'll bring
them to protest they'll bring guns
they'll just bring guns everywhere
they'll bring them to the store or
they'll keep them in their car
but we're told by cnn that the one place
the republicans will not bring and
brandish guns i don't know who had them
but they didn't brandish them
is to an armed insurrection
so the only place a republican won't
bring a gun
is to a planned armed insurrection
that's what the news is telling us
that all those other times
republicans are going to be you know
loaded for bear
literally and figuratively
but the only time they don't
is uh when it's time to use the guns for
armed insurrection so then they leave
them home
and somehow
somehow the base the democrat base is
buying all of us these are clearly
conflicting
conflicting fake news
but
i would like to suggest
an even better way to play this
rather than just wait for the the news
to serve up these
pairs of stories that don't make sense
together
what if you push it a little bit
and here's what i'd suggest and this is
based on uh
damn i wish this had been my idea i
would love for you to be hear this idea
and think oh he thought of that
but no chuck madden who's a user on
twitter not not the famous chuck madden
as far as i know
but chuck madden had this tweet idea
and then i
i i stole his idea and
i reworded it this way in a tweet
i said uh republicans should propose a
permanent ban
on every kind of weapon that was fired
or brandished on the january 6
insurrectionists by the insurrectionist
quote instructionist but not limited to
right so this complete ban
that
republicans should suggest
would be a complete ban on every kind of
uh weapon
that was either fired or brandished you
know shown
um
by the insurrectionist now not including
the police
because the the security needs weapons
of course but if you don't count the
people defending the capital
i think every single weapon used by the
insurrectionist should be banned
banned forever
now you might say to yourself scott
that would be on nothing
um
wow
i'm just hearing that
alex epstein's book
um
just
just screaming up the best seller list
so that's the one everybody's there's a
lot of pushback trying to keep it it's
called fossil future
and it looks like it's number two
yeah it was number anyway it was doing
great so let's see if we can get that to
number one
anyway back to my uh main story here
um
what do you think of that
what do you think of coming up with
legislation
the legislation of course would be
mostly a prank
but the point of the legislation is to
make the fake news cover it
because they would have to cover that
every single weapon used by the
insurrectionist would be banned
how would they cover that
seriously how would they cover it
would they say we're not going to cover
it because it's just a joke
they would have to explain why it's a
joke
wouldn't they
the reason it's a joke is because no
weapons were used by the
insurrectionists
except for a bison hat and a podium i
think
so i think it would be extra funny
to ban podiums
and bison hats as weapons of war
because nobody's gonna you know
they're not gonna get anybody to approve
the legislation so it doesn't matter
what it says it's just for effect
and then i thought could there be any
other opportunities where you could make
fake legislation
to highlight the fact that there's fake
news
could you make a law
against every fake news
think about it
here's another one suppose you made a
law
that says the
news business cannot intentionally has
to be intentional cannot intentionally
give misleading uh
medical news
intentionally accidentally still okay
but you cannot intentionally give
misleading
news during a pandemic
and then you use as your example cnn's
reporting that the president suggested
drinking bleach
and you say we're trying to prevent
any
any reporting
that is
non-medical during a pandemic
you say example one is cnn's
coverage saying that the president
suggested drinking bleach
because you say that should be illegal
because they know that he didn't
that would be the claim they know he
didn't say it
it's a pandemic
you don't want to give misleading
information from an official source
and they did
they changed what the official source
said the president united states they
changed it
and they made it wrong
from something that made sense and
wouldn't have hurt anybody because he
wasn't talking about bleach
and they turned it into bleach and then
they turned it into something that could
have killed somebody
what about ivermectin
do you think uh ivormectin would fall
into that i think so because it seems to
me that the news
turned divermectin into horse-paced and
something else and that wasn't accurate
i mean it wasn't an accurate way to
present it anyway it was technically
accurate
and so
could you come up with legislation that
would never get passed but just to make
a point of it every time there's a fake
news you you come up with a fake law
to deal with the fake news
i think you would find there are lots of
ways to do it
i don't know maybe it's a bad use of
congress but the fact that
our fake news stands forever
doesn't seem uh
like we should put up with that
all right remember i told you that uh
follow the money always works
but follow the insurance can even tell
you what's going to happen before it
happens
so now we have a story that germany the
country of germany is not helping
volkswagen
ensure against risk
for doing business in china
and the reason being the uyghurs and
maybe whatever else political risk there
is so china is becoming too risky for
business
do you remember when i do you remember
when i first first started saying that
how many of you remember and maybe you
can tell me what year it was
when i started saying i'm going to tell
people that china is too risky for
business
and 2018 somebody says that sounds about
right and
do you remember in 2018 did that sound
kind of
exaggerated
didn't really sound like something that
could happen did it
right
in 2018 china was a very safe bet
tons of companies were working there and
they were happy about it
so i was one who said that you would
soon see it being too risky to do
business in china and i've been you know
promoting that point of view quite
heavily for a few years
and here it is
here's the uh people running the
insurance risk for germany just said no
it's too risky for us
and
there you go
and what about uh
putin moving his oil around
well he can find other ways to move his
oil around and sell it but
if he wants everything to be insured
which is typically important for
transporters
maybe not maybe you won't get insured so
follow the insurance it's going to tell
you what's going on here
here's the biggest story of all
humankind maybe
i mean if you
see if you can think of what would be a
bigger story in the
like history of civilization
it sounds like this could be like a
little bit of tiny invention i'm going
to tell you about just a little
invention
biggest thing is civilization maybe
it's a
so scientists and engineers at the
university of texas at austin
they created a solution
that looks like sand and some low-cost
chemical
so it's a low-cost gel film
that they can make with abundant
materials in other words you don't need
any rare earth materials
you don't need to mine for diamonds or
gold or anything it's just sort of
routine things you can put together
and when you put these routine things
together
they suck
moisture out of the air
and they turn it into drinking water
what
what
it's like a little compound that looks
like sand and some other you know junk
in there
and you just
sort of put it there over a bucket of
water and it just turns the air into
water
what
now if this thing actually works i don't
know it looks like it might
that just changes everything
imagine if nobody ever had a water
problem again
all you'd need is a bucket of sand and
it would create all the water you wanted
yeah
i'm seeing in the comments i'm skeptical
you should be
but the amounts of water that they're
talking about are crazy
so here's what they're estimating
that even in the driest climates you can
get all kinds of so the material uh
would cost two dollars per kilogram
and one kilogram
uh can produce more than six liters of
water per day
in areas with less than thirty fifteen
percent relative humidity
and it and they can make
up to 13 liters of water in areas with
you know more relative humidity
13 liters of water
for one kilogram of this little material
in one day could make 13 kill what
and none of this says even
slightly possible does it
somebody says it's being done in morocco
yeah you know those of you who are
calling bs of this story i get it
i get it it doesn't sound true
but what if it is
what if it is
think about it we might be on the brink
of near unlimited
electrical power fusion
so like cost of electricity is going to
plunge
the cost of getting drinking water might
plunge
the ability to live off grid
now if you've got a
tesla battery
and you've got you know this stuff for
bringing you enough water
and then you've got let's say a bill
gates
what do you call it a bill gates is
making toilets that don't require
plumbing
just i guess i don't
it somehow takes care of itself
and
we're now almost at the point
where living off the grid yeah with your
starlink
thing you could pretty much live
completely off the grid without giving
up anything
we're really close to not having to give
up anything
well we'll see
um
i think we're going to have fusion and
water from the air and 3d printed food
and 3d printed manufacturing everywhere
that's what the future looks like
well elon musk says he's going to cut 10
of tesla staff
because he sees
trouble ahead with the economy
now
can somebody help me out
why is the trouble ahead with the
economy
well like why is he
pretty much all the smart people are
predicting some kind of recession next
year right
now
would i ask why
your first
instinct was inflation right
so the inflation means there's less
money to spend
except
you don't have inflation if people you
only have inflation if people are
spending
and if people are spending
you don't have a recession
so
here's how tough economics are
i don't i'm not really seeing the supply
chain collapsing the way people say it
should have
i feel like somehow we're figuring out
workarounds somehow i mean i don't
understand how the economy is working
right now
like i don't know why we're not
we haven't already run out of everything
i have no understanding of how we're
still alive
because the the news must be so
disconnected from reality
that we think we're dying any minute
but nothing like that is happening in
the real world
and it looks like there's a complete
disconnect between economics and what we
observe
right why do people still have jobs
what's going on
well
like i'm completely confused
how any of this is still working and yet
it is i mean it doesn't even look like
it's strained really
if i if you walk down the street does it
look like things are falling apart
i mean there's still a lot of stores
closed from
you know the pandemic or whatever but it
doesn't really look like things fell
apart
it looks like the weakest part of the
economy
got sort of washed out
but it was going to wash out anyway
yeah we we see the gas at 10 and i know
that hurts
but i'll bet people have just
pulled back their driving
so maybe that's what will hurt the
economy
oh that could be it if people drive less
they'll spend less i don't know
well
um i'm going to say that i'm going to be
a contrarian here
and
while it makes sense
let me explain what i think makes sense
from musk's point of view as a leader
here's a general statement
if your company is growing
every now and then you should pause and
cut 10 percent back
does everybody agree with that if you
have a growing company and things are
going well
it would be smart if you could do it
it's tough to execute but every now and
then you should just say okay we're just
going to fire 10 of the people that we
have so far and then we'll start growing
again
because you very easily
in good times when you're growing
it's easy to add employees you didn't
need that much
and then they've been there a few years
and you say to yourself okay can we just
get rid of them did they do anything and
then you have to get rid of them
so
my
my take on elon musk without reading his
mind
because we can't read his mind
is that
he's picking the very best time to do
this because it looks like there's a
reason
it looks like there's a reason
but it would be good to do anyway
so that's the part i don't think he'll
ever say out loud
which is that he probably thought there
was too much fat in the organization and
had nothing to do with the recession but
if you can use the recession as your
go-to
well i think the economy is turning
south i better start getting ahead of it
then it looks like you're ahead of the
ahead of the trend and
there's no way it's going to be wrong
right
every company can get rid of 10 of their
employees
they can all do it
and that wouldn't make any difference
tomorrow
so
whether or not there's going to be a
downturn we don't know
but if you're one of the smartest people
in the world you would definitely
take the opportunity
created by the downturn
to make some adjustments in your company
so
no surprise
um
i don't know if there's a recession
coming
i really
don't because everything that we thought
we could predict didn't happen
i mean
i guess everybody predicted we'd have
more inflation because we spent more
money but that's that's more just math
um
somebody's saying that i'm so rich i
don't realize that most people's money
will be going only to the necessary
items
well
i mean obviously i understand what
happens when people have less money did
you think i didn't understand that
what i'm noticing is that people save to
so much money during
the pandemic
that there's a little bit of excess cash
burning a hole in their pockets
like they haven't had time to spend it
so i've got a feeling there's more
there's more slop or more play in the
economy than the experts think
and that we'll be fine
so i'm going to stick with my original
prediction which is as long as
employment stays good
you'll be fine everything else will work
its way out
employment is the one that's
catastrophic
you lose employment and then it's the
great depression
but as long as you're employed
i don't know i think we'll just limp
along and figure our way out
that's what it looks like to me
that's the good news
and
it's a very non-newsy day
why did
fed attack what's that
the fed said they would drive the
economy into recession to tame record
inflation
[Music]
yeah
so the fed says that they're going to do
it they're going to intentionally create
a recession
i don't know
i think they'll intentionally slow
things down
uh
the free money passed out by biden no
matter how you slice it is worthless is
it
yeah it's hard to get employees even in
rural yeah
your spouse took a 25 pay cut
no savings rates did not go up that's
true
but when you talk to people individually
people will individually often say
uh
i've got this money i didn't spend and
now i want to go somewhere
part of things like tesla yeah so
coinbase just rescinded a bunch of job
offers but coinbase is a special case
because crypto's
you know so volatile
and tesla's a special case too
so
i
i wouldn't worry about that
all right
investment portfolios are starting to
tank
in the short run
but you should not be owning a portfolio
for the short run
yeah the short run is ugly
i mean my my net worth is down
what a third or something
which is pretty painful
um
so tell me about the baby food shortage
we talked about that i think babies food
shortage is the scariest one of the
scariest things i've ever heard of yeah
the fly formula
but it looks like we figured it out
right
what is happening to the mothers who
actually can't get to me
like what are they feeding their babies
instead
so there's part of the story that's
missing like the water people doing
instead i hear all the stories about not
finding anything
just milk
goat milk if over six months
these babies are in the hospital
um
all right
um
yeah i don't understand what's going on
with that situation i feel like there
should either be more reporting on it or
more information
it's a little bit of a black box there
all right imagine imagine if that same
story existed during the trump
administration
imagine the trump administration being
in charge
and babies not getting enough food can
you even imagine that
like the the fact that it's being
treated with such kid gloves
is only because it's a
democrat administration
would have been deported
all right is there any other story that
uh i should have talked about
but i didn't
i even thought the gas prices went down
a little bit oh yeah matt walsh's
uh what is a woman
movie
is out
and uh
i saw some interesting reviews on that
but i'm definitely gonna watch that
tonight
is anybody who watched that the matt
walsh
is a documentary or film
what is a woman apparently
apparently the fun part is watching
people try to answer simple questions
which to me sounds pretty entertaining
so i'll definitely be watching that
tonight
uh will i ever do interviews again you
mean interviews with other people
as in i interview other people is that
what you're asking
maybe
i don't know
maybe
i i don't enjoy them as much that's the
trouble
when i do this
it's as comfortable as just waking up
but if i have somebody on i usually have
to read a book i mean it's just a whole
level
level difference
but maybe
special cases
covet update
well i don't think i have any lingering
uh after effects although yesterday i
was pretty tired
yesterday i fell asleep
six times
during the ordinary day
in other words i would wake up in a
chair
six times yesterday
at least six times i would go
okay where am i
okay i guess about two o'clock in the
afternoon
and i just had to figure out who i was
and where i was
now is that because of
kovid or just not getting enough sleep i
don't know
so i think i'm gonna uh
so i don't i don't feel any brain fog
i did feel brain fog when i had the
active symptoms but at the moment i
don't feel any i've lost anything
all right
you're old
take your vitamins thank you for that
uh putin and cancer i don't know
all right yeah it looks like lack of
sleep is my problem
um i think i'm gonna take a break from
cannabis for a while
i made the mistake of getting some
product that is super super powerful
and it really sort of ruined the
experience
uh i didn't think that was possible
but it turned it from a thing that would
always make you feel better to something
that would make you feel different
which wasn't really the plan
so i think i'll take a little break from
that
um
newsday is printing an old dilbert
really
is that because they couldn't handle the
uh
pharma comics
i wonder if anybody else is not running
gilbert this week
because dilbert is a big farmer now
