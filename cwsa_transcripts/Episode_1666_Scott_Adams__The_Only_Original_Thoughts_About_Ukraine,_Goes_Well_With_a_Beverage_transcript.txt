good morning ladies and gentlemen
and everything in between
and in addition
this
is really the culmination of an entire
lifetime for you but more importantly
this is the culmination of over 15
billion years
of the universe's evolution
whoops
youtube you can hear me now
thank you paul
your system is working very very well
i appreciate that
so
here's why you missed youtube
when my microphone was not plugged in
why you missed was you've come to the
best place in the world at the best time
and congratulations and would you like
to take it up a notch and would you like
to learn something about ukraine that
you never really understood before
well this is the place to come and all
you need is a cupper bug or a glass
eight tanker tell us to sign the canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite beverage
i like coffee
what
are you kidding me youtube is
still bad sound
huh
okay
well
that's all i can do i think so
we're plugged in
let's see if i've got any
oh good over there okay sound is good
so here's what's uh going on in the
world
now as promised
i'm going to give you
the most unusual take
on ukraine and russia that you've ever
seen
is that worth staying around for because
everybody else is going to be talking
about the same topic today
so today
has to be the best one
was there something missing
was there something missing
was it the
dopamine high of the day was that the
thing that you're
all here for the simultaneous sip
okay here it comes go
wow everything is
poly wompus today
you've heard that term
is that a term paulie lumpus
it's possible i just made that up
well we're in the uh ukraine fog of war
stage and that means that a hundred
percent of the things you hear in the
news are
fake
do you remember yesterday
when uh i saw some people on social
media
picking up on the fact that apparently
the ukrainians
were putting up stiff resistance
do you believe that
how many of you believe that the
ukrainians killed 2 800
russian troops in one day that was
acclaimed by one of the pro-ukrainian
people
and
totally stopped the russian incursion
so that that was something i was hearing
i think yesterday
at the same time when uh actual military
people were talking
i forget which ones it
it was but some people who actually knew
what they were talking about said uh
let's get this
straight there's no comparison between
the russian army and the ukrainian army
if the russians have not gotten what
they want yet
it's just because they're staging
it's just not it's just not time yet
so
there's probably nothing that can be
deduced
by any one day report
on whether the ukrainian resistance is
being effective or not
i would say
that we probably can say with some
confidence
that the ukrainians are insanely brave
i don't even know if that's a compliment
honestly because there's bravery and
then there's you know going too far
isn't there
but if russia thought that the
ukrainians were just going to bend over
it doesn't look like that's going to
happen
i'll tell you one thing that ukraine got
out of this so far
and maybe it won't be enough and
maybe it won't be anything
but so far
they definitely have our respect
am i right
like there's nobody watching ukraine
saying
oh we don't think you guys are good or
smart or awesome
pretty much everybody's looking at
ukraine and saying
now that's a country
like that's
that's what you want to see there's some
there's some fighting spirit there at
the same time i don't want to see them
fight for nothing
right do you want to see them fight and
die for
you know what might be a foregone
conclusion
nope
so it's a tough situation here's some
things around that topic uh so new york
times was reporting
that the u.s had been meeting with china
for a long time i guess months
and uh trying to get china to help
talk putin out of invading
and china's response was to share the
american intel with russia
now that's the story
does that sound true
and and what do you make of it
yeah i kind of just read the headline
but if you just but if you just read the
headline
what kind of intel do you think we
shared with china that they shared with
with putin and do you think it was
anything important
you know anything that they didn't
already know we could see
i mean it was probably nothing but
satellite imagery right
what the hell else were we going to show
china
do you think we went over and said to
china look
we don't usually
share our sources and methods
but we really need your help
so just this one time we're going to
show you how our entire intelligence
agency works
so you'll get on our side on this putin
thing and then
and then china sold us out and gave all
our sources and methods to russia
i don't think so
this looks like a complete fake story
doesn't it
fake
not in the details
by how the details are told
because
can you imagine that we actually
literally
gave china some intel
that would have surprised russia
you know did russia see this from china
and say
whoa
we did not know the americans could see
things from the air
what's a satellite
now obviously we also have things like
you know captured
signal intelligence and stuff presumably
but do you think we shared all that with
china if we had if we had satellite
pictures
of massive military might heading toward
ukraine don't you think that would have
been enough
plus his public statements
so i this looks like a complete fake
story it looks like a it looks like a
war propaganda story
to me
all right
there's a story that the ukrainian
government asked the citizens to change
the street signs
now i don't know if this is true either
i guess there's going to be one theme
for the show today
just assume that everything i tell you
might not be true
because it's something i heard from
sources that are in the fog of war and
they're all liars
so just assume none of it's true
but it's not going to be less
interesting
it should be
but it won't make it less interesting
so allegedly i saw this in a tweet by
christo grazev
that ukraine's interior ministry asked
the residents to take down street signs
in order to confuse oncoming russian
troops
sounds like a good idea but then the
state road science agency went one step
further
and apparently all the directions on the
street signs are going to be changed to
go yourself
presumably in russian
do you believe that
i don't
i don't because first of all
if you were legitimately trying to
confuse the enemy
you would change the signs to something
that looked believable but wrong
right
isn't that kind of obvious
if you really were doing this for
military reasons
and this story were you know with any
with any shred of truth to it
you would yeah you would move the
science exactly you wouldn't even
destroy the science you just put them in
different places
obvious
most obvious thing right
now i'm sure that russians also have gps
so what's the difference
right as as you're saying in the
comments if you have gps what the hell
does the road signs have to do with
anything
and
so so
true story or fake story
i think it's a fake story
what do you think
i'm gonna go with fake all right
um
one of the things that uh russia has
going for it is that because it's the
energy source to europe europe can't go
that hard on
russia because it doesn't want to lose
its energy
so even the talking about
the
taking away the swift
access you know the access to
international banking through this
electronic system that moves money
around the major banks if russia is
taken out of the the
electronic
distribution part of the banking system
called the swift
um it turns out that that's not going to
make that much difference
because even what we're contemplating is
carving out the part
where they can't pay for energy so
energy would not be included in the
sanctions
so so russia could still use the swift
system
you know to sell their energy
and that's the main thing they sell
so
the whole swift thing might not make
that much difference i saw an article on
g zero
uh
this
quoted somebody suggesting there might
be a five percent dip
in russia's
gdp if they get taken off of swift
but i'm not even sure it would be that
and i'm not even sure anybody can
estimate it
so
getting back to the pipeline
if russia is kind of held
is holding europe captive because it
controls energy
how can ukraine ever get
anything done because basically
they're not going to get as much help as
they need
it looks like
europe's strategy might be to do to be a
little bit too slow
and then i
i saw andres beckham say this on twitter
that maybe germany's strategy is to say
yeah we'll help
yeah we're we're going to help
let let's uh let's help you oh it's too
late oh
darn
well there's nothing you can do now
because russia already owns ukraine
so it might actually be an intentional
european strategy to pretend to be
helpful
to literally pretend
yeah to slow walk it exactly the the
corporate word for it to slow walk it
and just say oops
too late
thanks for the energy russia
too bad ukraine
now if you were ukraine
now you do want the goodwill of the
world and they seem to be playing that
card pretty well
you don't want to lose it
but on the other hand
you don't think you would make you would
take that card off the table
from a military perspective
because if somebody whoever
blew up the key
key pipeline so that europe didn't have
energy anyway
would europe then be free to act because
they would have nothing to gain they
didn't have energy anyway
i don't know
and could anybody get to the pipelines
or are they so well protected and if
they're so well protected
why don't you make the whole country out
of that
that's the old joke about the black box
on the airplane
airplane crashes but the black box seems
to survive
and then all the jokesters say well why
don't you make the whole plane out of
that black box stuff
same thing about the pipelines
if the ukrainians can't get to the
pipelines
that are crisscrossing the country
because they're so well fortified
you should make make the whole country
out of that stuff whatever it is magic i
don't know is there anything that you
can't dig
you you can't dig a hole and get to it
there's no maintenance
there's no maintenance access anywhere
no pumping stations
halfway anywhere
it just seems to be there would have to
be some kind of access
all right
anyway that's just an open question
doesn't look like anybody's going to
blow up any pipelines
here's a one way to look at
putin
and then we'll go to the white board and
i'll explain to you exactly what's going
on
have we not been confused about what the
hell is putin's objective
right
because i would say that our media is so
unreliable and scattered
that they never really told us
what's going on or why
why do you think that our media did such
a bad job
do you think it's incompetence
or something else
just incompetence or something else for
now those are your only two choices the
for something else could be any category
incompetence or something else why why
did we not know what the hell putin was
up to and why
okay i'm saying
your answers are all over the place okay
i think there's at least a little bit of
something else
and a little bit of incompetence
so you know it's easy to say any
any large organization or any group of
people is going to have plenty of
incompetence in it that's easy to say
but it feels like something else
and do you know what that something else
might be
let's dig a little deeper
what do you believe that something else
is
go
in the comments what do you think
somebody says money
barisma something about ukraine in the
bidens people are saying
just reading your comments
corruption biden connection
uh
putin and the soviet union and
blah blah blah
okay
here's one possibility
have you heard
putin's version of events
putin's version of events
is that the united states has been the
aggressor
and has been
you know getting closer and closer to
encircling
russia with nato and has been a bully
since the soviet union fell
and that russia has been belittled
embarrassed and pushed
by the united states
decades
and when he they reached a certain line
they had pushed too far
can somebody give me a uh
history lesson was georgia
ever considered for
uh nato
can somebody
because i i don't have good history so
i'm seeing some yeses there and then
some notes yes or no
um
i guess i guess i'm seeing maybe there
was some discussion about it it looks
like looks like there's some discussion
about it as opposed to any formal
process
so and then uh
and then russia moved right pune moved
on georgia
and then ukraine
the conversation comes up about nato and
now we've seen that he moved
and i was trying to understand
the motivation so first of all
from putin's telling he tells it like a
victim
he tells it like a victim now nothing i
say should suggest i'm agreeing with
putin okay i'm just saying his telling
is that he's the victim
and that he's been literally bullied
now i saw a uh
article from 2014 that was in
atlantic magazine
by joseph burgo
and he had a theory back then hypothesis
that putin is a narcissist
and his you know
one one can assume that his own
sense of ego is tied up with russia in
general and russia's history and
russia's
legacy and everything else
now
what would cause somebody to become a
narcissist
according to
many experts do you know what turns
somebody into a narcissist
being bullied
do you think putin never got bullied as
a kid
almost certainly yeah and there are
reports of it but who knows and that
apparently he re he reacted very
aggressively against bullies as a kid
now again nobody can confirm that any of
this is true
i'm not even sure we know anything about
his childhood really
but
that's a report
so follow with me to connect some dots
if he were bullied
that would turn him into a narcissist
allegedly a narcissist would be
overly sensitive to
how people view them
and then here's the weird part
when somebody is a narcissist they have
a
certain set of behaviors that are so
baked in
it's very much like alcoholics
if if you've known if you've ever known
more than one alcoholic
did you ever say to yourself well that's
weird they act the same
there's like these set of behaviors that
are only alcoholic behaviors but two
complete strangers
and you had the alcohol and they act the
same
well
narcissists are like that
the the specificity of how they act is
just weird
like you could take one from two sides
of the world
and you could tell you could tell what
they're gonna do before they do it
they're that predictable and here's one
of the weird parts
projection
now
i've actually said that it didn't exist
and people were just making it up
and everybody was just like yeah you
know people think the same so
you know obviously i think you might be
thinking a little bit the same as me and
i'd always discounted it
but there's a special kind of
projection that only applies to
narcissists
which is
a weird kind
now a weird projection
would be like this
if somebody said
let's say you blamed a narcissist
of running over your dog
and you say you ran over my dog what
would the narcissist say first no i
didn't because they're they're liars
they're always liars no i didn't
i did not run over your dog then you say
here's video
i've got video from five angles and you
know ten um and ten uh witnesses that
you ran over a dog
here it is right here look at it there's
your face there's you in the driver's
seat there's my dog you're running over
it there's no doubt about this
what does the narcissist say when given
absolute proof
always
they say you ran over my dog
and the narcissist would say that even
knowing that you don't own a car
and the narcissist never owned a dog
and you say to yourself i don't know
what's happening here
this is weird
how could you be blaming me of the exact
thing i'm blaming you of
when
i you don't even own a dog and never
have
and the narcissist will keep with that
story
and you'll say to yourself i don't even
know what's going on here. and then do
you know what the narcissist says
i think maybe you should seek
professional help because you're
starting to lose it
that's the checklist it goes just like
that each time so as soon as it's
obvious that the narcissist is
completely
denying obvious reality they'll tell you
that you've lost your mind and you can't
see what's right in front of you
now
yeah gaslighting you that would be cool
so look at what putin's done
and how this is all developed
you know i'm going to go to the
the visuals here now
i'm not great with geography so just
roughly speaking there's this big mass
called russia
and the the first offense to putin's
let's say his ego
was when georgia
sort of sort of hangs down here
so georgia
started
talking about maybe being part of nato
so russia you know jumped right in and
controlled it
but now
um
you've got ukraine
ukraine
ukraine which uh
um
i think you can see what's developing
here if you're putin
ukraine and georgia form the
genitalia of russia
so it's literally the and balls of
russia
and so
if russia were to uh lose some of the
little dingleberry countries that were
just not that important
he can live with that it's embarrassing
but you can live with it
but nato said
hey putin
since we picked off some of these little
uh
little underlying countries and we we
put them to nato how about our next step
logically
would be to cut off your balls
and
in front of the world
i can't see what problem that would
cause
do you
let's just cut off your entire and
balls while everybody's watching and see
if that gets a reaction from you do you
know why
because he only appreciates toughness
he only appreciates toughness
right so isn't it smart
to do the most humiliating thing you can
do to him in front of the world
because he only appreciates toughness
except
he doesn't like bullies
he doesn't like bullies
did we know that about him
maybe we should have
now because his system is not a
democratic system where he doesn't have
to worry about losing power this is
personal
and
you know even though it's a weird
coincidence that these two countries
form the and balls of russia
i think you see my point
don't you when you say to yourself why
is putin acting irrationally
it's because we made him act
irrationally
do you know
do you know who else would act
irrationally
now ladies
i'm going to ask the men to explain this
to you
you may not be aware of this
one of the things that makes men act
irrationally and sometimes angry
is any threat any threat whatsoever to
our or our balls
we don't even act rational after that
we're just sort of mad
we might do some stuff to you
if you threaten any of that area that
situation
and so
without all the details of history of
all the slights and abuses we have dealt
to putin
let's go all the way back to 2008 when
putin asked if he could join nato
yeah
now we've talked about that before but
why did this only recently come up
i would guess it's the same reason that
our media has not informed us well about
putin's motives
i believe that our cia and our
intelligence agencies are heavily
staffed with russia experts
just for sort of a legacy from the cold
war
and that all the russia experts needed
something to do
and they'd all come to the belief
that the only way that putin would
respond is if you could you know
close them in and put the pressure on
him
he literally asked to join our club
he literally asked to join nato
does that sound like the guy
who couldn't get along if you wanted him
to
i mean is russia getting along with
china or are they hacking each other all
the time i don't know maybe there
but
i feel like russia gets along with other
countries
am i wrong doesn't russia get along with
other countries
i feel as though
the cia
 up so badly
in reading reading the room if you will
and tried to overthrow literally tried
to overthrow putin
literally tried to embarrass him
literally tried to
pick him apart one part at a time to
destroy russia
why were we trying to destroy russia
well
what was the purpose of that
and
is everything that we see just putin
reacting exactly the way you would
expect somebody in his situation
it looks like it to me
i mean it looks exactly like how you
would expect somebody to react in that
situation
now on top of that
here's my big breaking news
this is just my opinion but one of the
the weird things about narcissists
is that they will accuse you of the as i
said the exact thing that they're doing
did you see that putin just accused the
ukrainian government
of being a bunch of drug addicts
did that does that catch your attention
as an unusual accusation
i've i don't know if i've ever heard
that before have you has anybody ever
called an entire government a bunch of
drug addicts
and then used that as a pretense for
attacking
do you know what that sounds like
exactly
that sounds like a narcissist
projecting and how do you interpret that
there's one way to interpret that
that putin himself is a drug addict and
is telling you telling you in the most
direct way a narcissist can
the way a narcissist tells you what
they're up to is they blame you for
doing it
that's how you know
that's the trick
and uh
my background in hypnosis would tell me
the same thing
the fact it was even on his mind because
it's a weird thing to even be on your
mind right
we've all seen zielinski a million times
does zolansky look like he's on drugs
not at all
does putin
does putin look like he's on drugs
lately
you know that macron said that he seemed
like a different person like darker
more intense
yeah
yeah i would say that putin has revealed
because this is sort of a hypnotist
trick
is is how to know that
how to know what people are thinking
they have the hypnotist knows that
people reveal in their choice of words
their inner thoughts they don't know
they're doing it but the words that come
most easily to them are the ones that
are in the zone of the thing they're
trying to keep from you if you know what
i mean
so just if you look at their choice of
words you know okay those words come
from this zone of thinking that's really
what where that's about
so
if you look at putin looks different to
me he looks less healthy there is some
talk that he's quote losing it
but i think that probably comes from our
own intelligence agencies
you know and so who knows if that's true
right
so i wouldn't take it as true
any story of any um
adversary's mental health
you can't take any of those stories as
true but you can observe yourself
and i tweeted this morning uh putin's
explanation
of the great humiliations that have been
heaped upon him
see for yourself
see in putin's words
if that looks like the old putin
it doesn't look it look like it to me
it looks like he snapped
and i would say there's a probability
this is my speculation
that two things have come together in a
tragic way number one he got pushed too
far
at the same time he was taking some kind
of medication
that made him not want to be pushed
like extra extra
not want to be pushed
like
if i'm going to snap
it's going to happen now kind of drug
now i'm not going to speculate what it
would be
you know i i often think you know you
think of steroids and prednisone and but
it could be anything
it could they're probably a
constellation
of a gas there's probably a whole
constellation of drugs
that are
you prescribe for ordinary medical
problems
of which you would imagine he would be
at this point
having some he's that age
and so
so i submit to you the two forces have
come together the humiliation of
russia over time that has been
relentless
with him getting on some kind of change
of it could be a mental health change
that's possible but i think more likely
since there's a subness to it
uh
well i guess i could go either way but
i'm gonna go i'm gonna go with a
someday we will know that he's drugged
up like hitler was
now hitler was on all kinds of
right
does anybody tell me what was hitler on
in in his worst days
was hillary on meth
because amphetamines are what make you
this way right
would you would you agree that the
the amphetamines the meth
are most likely
what's going to make you
overreach
and you know act out of ego is that
would that be true i mean it's pretty
it's pretty obvious he's not in
mushrooms
you know he's not an ecstasy
he's not on weed
i don't even think he's drunk
i think he's prescription meds of some
kind
he probably has a few months to live
you know i don't know if people act that
way do they
if you only have a few months to live do
you try to get that thing done or do you
just say you know
i just got other things to worry about
now
i don't think you'd want to work that
hard if you only have a few months to
live but
maybe that's just me
um cnn refers to the
action in ukraine as an unprovoked
invasion
would you say it's unprovoked
go
in your opinion with what we know so far
is the invasion of ukraine unprovoked
i'm saying mostly knows
yeah and doesn't it
doesn't it depend you know we see i see
s's and those
but it depends on your definition of
provoked doesn't it
if
if you knew
that ukraine was on your doorstep
and your mortal enemy was going to use
it to put weapons
wouldn't you feel provoked
if somebody were let's say how about the
cuban missile crisis
was kennedy provoked
let's ask that one
was kennedy provoked by russia soviet
union i guess the soviet union
with the missile
uh russia the cuban missile crisis yes
yes we would call that provoked even
though nobody fired anybody or invaded
anybody right
am i right
we would all call that provoked we've
all been trained
we've been taught in school
that that was a provocation
and that the response to it was
perfectly legitimate
we just did exactly the same thing to
russia
that that the soviet union was trying to
do to us
they were provoked
they were absolutely provoked
now
i don't approve of what russia is doing
in ukraine just to be clear i'm not i'm
not pro-russia but it does help to
understand
that we provoked the out of them
and should have seen it coming from a
mile away
which we did
and it looks like what is happening now
is in
on top of the tragedy in ukraine itself
which is tragedy number one
but
well i guess there's tragedies all
around here
um
i think
i think that we're going to be
gas lit in the united states
to be
taught that this is purely
a russian aggression situation
and i think that's only half of it
putin's definitely
it looks like something's different you
know maybe he just reached the last
straw and maybe that's all it is but
it's different
and then other people talk about you
know just
power will keep going until you stop it
so all putin's doing is taking advantage
of situations but it seems to me like
the situations he's taking advantage of
all do seem to have a strategic
point to them
so they don't seem crazy up to this
point
all right
compare uh how we've been treating
russia with how trump
treated russia if you imagine
that of course russia wants lots of
things you know what's a strong defense
and a good economy and all that stuff
but if you imagine the important thing
here
if you imagine the important thing
is how you know
how putin feels about his place in
history and whether he's bullied and
whether russia has been bullied and all
that
think about how trump handled that
trump handled uh putin
and by extension russia
with complete respect and
so so trump knew how to handle this
exact situation if if my hypothesis
is right
trump knew how to handle it
just tell him he's a genius and russia
is awesome
and maybe we can work with you
that was exactly the right thing to do
now who who sounds scarier
the one who says hey you know you're
kind of smart and you're awesome and
let's work together
does that sound dangerous or the one who
says we're gonna have to put nato on
your doorstep and put a bunch of weapons
in ukraine and by the way it used to be
your and balls but we took it from
you
like which one is handling that the
right way
correct me if i'm wrong but didn't world
war ii happen because of the way we
handled world war one we meaning
everybody who didn't lose
now
is that historically correct that world
war ii happened because
of how poorly we handled world war one
and now we're watching the what happened
about how we handled
the decline of the soviet union
so putin's point of view is that we
should have been just as helpful
and we would have had a good friend in
russia
and you know what
i'll bet that's true
i'll bet that's true i'll bet if we had
been gracious
and helpful
when the iron curtain fell
that we would actually have an ally i'll
bet that's true no there's no way to
know right i mean
maybe smarter people have a better idea
about that but
um
every country that we act graceful
to in victory
germany
japan
am i wrong that they're
now our strongest allies
and that that's how you make an ally
right by being not a dick
and apparently we've been a dick to
russia for years
you know every time we talk about russia
we say you know
their
their economy is like texas
it's sort of a third-rate country with
nukes that's what they are that's how we
talk about them
do you think he has any reason to want
to like move that in the other direction
because here's here's another theory
about countries and businesses and
people i guess
things never stay the same
so russia is either ascending or
descending would you agree with that
statement it's never
it's not going to just always be just
russia
it's always ascending or descending and
those are the only two choices
so it looks like putin decided to stop
descending
and he said all right well i'm just
going to do whatever it takes to us end
because you're either ascending or
descending and my job is to ascend
so there's
there's a lot going on here
all right
what about the switzerland option
that i think is being floated at the
moment
but and was floated and rejected and
i feel like the way that we're
um the way we're talking about this
whole thing and framing it is the
problem
if instead of saying that ukraine is
either going to be owned by russia
or dominated by nato
choices that can't ever work because the
other side won't let it
why didn't we start out with saying uh
that there's a there's something called
a switzerland option
and if the united nations gives somebody
a let's say a switzerland designation
then every country has to defend them
how about that
you just say
you know
nobody is nato we're not going to put
any weapons there but if anybody attacks
one of these switzerland neutral
countries that we've designated as
neutral
and maybe they need to be neutral
maybe the very best thing is to have a
neutral country between
two countries that
aren't so neutral toward each other
all right
um i don't know if that's ever an option
but it's too late at this point because
russia can basically do whatever what it
wants with ukraine in the long run it
looks like it looks like we could be
surprised
now
so of course now finland and sweden are
saying that they're thinking about
joining nato because they feel a little
exposed
and russia is of course saying they
could have dire consequences
now
again
have
have
finland and sweden suffered from by not
being in nato
so all these this time has gone by
do you think uh sweden has ever said
darn i wish we were in nato
because it would have cost the money and
i don't think it would have bought him
anything yet
so i feel as if
we're just creating a bunch of made-up
problems
because we're bullying each other
and
neither side wants to put up with
bullies
it just feels like bullying and bullying
and posturing and
psychological stuff
all right
and that
ladies and gentlemen
oh one other thing the the only other
story is about the uh
biden's nominee for the supreme court
uh could katanji brown jackson
and i ask you this
if we know in advance
that the liberal appointed judge is
always going to go
with the liberals
if you know how somebody's going to vote
before you nominate them and we really
do
am i right
you know the days where you didn't know
how somebody was going to vote or kind
of over
uh i think we always know everybody's
going to vote on anything important you
know there may be some
all right so i'm here here's something
uh
i'm saying here so maya gameworks over
on youtube is yelling at me scott i'm in
cav and the russians have lost i've seen
some messages go by
suggesting that
you've already
kicked out the russian army
now
no pictures
i
i would have to see some pictures
and i would have to have lots of
confirmation of that i'm not going to
buy
i mean to me that just sounds like
propaganda
now i don't know who you are and you
know if you're if you're being honest
that's great but even if you're in kiev
i don't think you'd know you just know
what's happening on your street you
wouldn't know what's happening anywhere
else
because we don't know
like
all right but back to the supreme court
nominee i think the republicans should
just
make their little speeches
ask their tough questions because it
gives them some tv time but basically
they should just vote her in because
there's no mystery
about any of these judges anymore
know you know what they're going to vote
before they get in there so either they
have the power to put her in or or not
air security makes ukraine the automatic
loser
i don't know about the air superiority
part
because does air superiority
help you clear a metro center
and ultimately they're going to have to
clear street by street does
does air power help you that much
in urban fighting
i mean i mean yes i mean it helps you
some but
is that the decisive part
i don't know seems like it's a
door-to-door fighting i wouldn't want to
go door-to-door with the ukrainians
right now
and
let me ask you this if if the russian
army
you know came down a street with
uh armed people with aks and
and their molotov cocktails
couldn't the residents just open the
windows at the same time and reign hell
down on the russian army in the street
i guess i don't know enough about urban
warfare
to know how an organized defender
couldn't easily repel somebody that way
not easily but maybe effectively would
be the better way to say it
yeah
all right that is all i've got to say
for today
i think it was
a success
i believe this is the only place you're
ever going to hear the
 and balls hypothesis of ukraine and
georgia and i think it's the only one
that matters
am i right
am i right i think i'm right
best thing you've ever seen
thank you
and i'll talk to you on youtube tomorrow
