hey everybody come on in
did you think 2021 was gonna be boring
nope i'm glad we saved up all the
craziness
for the first week day after the the
holidays
i feel like i was worried things might
get
boring but then we've got the lizard
squad
we'll talk about that in a moment
i said lizard squad that's actually in
the news
the lizard squad but before we get to
that fun news all you need to enjoy this
in the maximum
possible way and why would you settle
for anything less frankly
would you no no you're not going to
settle for less
so get your copper marker glass tanker
chelsea's die in a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind and get ready to
maximize your experience with the little
thing i call
the simultaneous sip feeling connected
to people
all over the world better than even
fungi yeah you think fungi are connected
underneath the forest floor well they
are
but not as much as we're going to be
connected in a moment
with a simultaneous sip the dopamine of
the day have i built this up a little
too much
go
no no i didn't build it up too much
it was just as good as i thought it
would be sometimes i think i'm
exaggerating then
no not exaggerating at all
story number one
the fellow named tyler bowier
uh he reports that he was uh he was
elected to the gop
chair in maricopa county and he says he
met with uh
then senator mccain who is now the late
senator mccain
and he said he met with him just out of
respect for the office and that
uh this is what he said he tried to buy
me off
by offering local chamber money chamber
of commerce i guess
local chamber money he said he
controlled he wasn't shy about it
it didn't work and now what do you think
of that story
does that sound true well senator mccain
is not here to defend himself
so it's a little bit unfair because
the person isn't here to defend himself
but
i don't see anything about it that
strikes me as
a lie i mean it doesn't seem like
something you would make up
because it's got this detail about the
chamber money he said he controlled
that's not exactly the kind of lie you
would make up right
if you're going to make this up as a lie
you would say
senator mccain said he had some money
you know and he would put it my way or
something but you wouldn't say something
so specific
that he controlled the chamber money and
over that's pretty
specific i think he's telling the truth
and my only comment on this is that
i prefer bribers who don't get caught
scene um in other news
some employees of google and alphabet
are trying to
organize to create a union we don't know
how the well they'll do
but i won i wondered why do you need a
union
at google don't you you always hear it's
like the best place to work and
people are fighting to work there and
salaries are good
and benefits are great and it's a
prestigious job in the middle of the
most
active industry in the world and a great
place to live in many places depending
on where the office is
why would you need a union
and so i looked at the details
turns out they're not so focused on
compensation no they're not really
focused on working conditions
some of the things you would expect from
a union nope
they're focused on the lack of wokeness
at google because as woke as google is
it's not woke enough because it's doing
contracts for the
department of defense
you know protect country homeland
security
so that's no good according to these
folks at google and what else has they
done
uh they've profited from advertisements
by hate groups now when i say hey group
i mean a group that somebody else
doesn't like
maybe that group is a hate group maybe
they're not but if you hate them
well let's call them a hate group it's
close enough
so those were their the two things that
they surfaced
as being worthy of note for their major
claims
are two wokeness items now
how perfect is it that google could be
taken down
by wokeness i don't know that it'll
happen
but it's a fun story but not as fun
as yeah i'm gonna get to trump's phone
call
i'm building you up to it it's this is
the build up
um so attorney lynnwood who as you know
is working
for the president's uh benefit on the
election fraud stuff
but that's not all he's doing it turns
out that
lynnwood has something else to say today
totally believable and it goes like this
now let me be very clear this is not
my opinion
what you're going to hear now is
somebody else's opinion
or fact we don't know but it goes like
this
linwood tweeted i believe chief justice
john roberts
and a multitude of powerful individuals
worldwide
are being blackmailed in a horrendous
scheme involving
rape and murder of children captured on
videotape
it's captured on videotape well if it's
captured on videotape
obviously it's true because there's
never anything that's on videotape
that's not true
hold that thought hold that thought for
later
but given that it's right there on video
and apparently he has access to it
there's a
crypto key and there's a file and
something and he apparently has access
to it
wouldn't you think you might see
i don't know one screenshot
for example i don't have to see the
whole video because it sounds like the
video is pretty bad
which totally exists
and you know why you know it exists
comes from a credible source called the
lizard squad
now if you are going to be a credible
organization
one way to advertise your credibility is
to name yourself the lizard squad
there apparently some hackers who got
into
these files and have determined that
these are
actual files showing
rape and murder of children and
wouldn't you expect to see at least a
screen grab
maybe not something that shows the whole
story
but wouldn't you like to know that at
least
chief justice roberts is on it
because if he's not on one of these
videos
i'm not so sure there's any kind of
evidence
and by now wouldn't we see at least a
screenshot
not the whole video of course we don't
want to see that
but a screenshot or how about has he
shown it to somebody else let's say a
prosecutor
uh has he shown it to a prosecutor and
has the prosecutor said yes
i've looked at this video looks real to
me
or at least something i need to look
into to find out if it's real
where's that kind of missing
kind of missing well here's my take on
this i think the odds that
john roberts is on any kind of a
blackmail video are really really small
like really really small like
if you were to take all of the
allegations that have ever been made
since the beginning of time
and rank them from most credible to
least
this might be close the least now
let me say this as clearly as i can
because i know you're not gonna
hear me this is one of those topics
where i could look at you and say 2 plus
2 equals 4
and a lot of you will go away saying he
keeps saying 2 plus 2 is 5.
i don't know what's wrong with him and
i'll just say 2 plus 2 is 4
and you'll hear 2 plus 2 is 5. it's
going to happen right now
are you ready it'll happen right now not
to all of you
but some of you watching will hear two
plus two is five when i say two plus two
is four are you ready
here it comes i'm
guaranteed it's gotta be true
that there are very important people who
are being blackmailed
by major intelligence services
that's got to be true because it falls
into the category of
something that would have a high upside
potential blackmailing
important people if you're an
intelligence agency
your risk of getting in trouble for it
is zero
because that's actually your job what is
somebody gonna say uh
hey intelligence agency your your guy is
trying to blackmail me
and what is the boss of the guy doing
the blackmailing gonna say
is he gonna say oh i gotta fire that guy
no
no the head of the agency would say well
that's why we hired him
he's supposed to be blackmailing you and
by the way
he did a good job so you better shut up
because we got
all the evidence on you so
if you have a case where there's no risk
of penalty at least for the person doing
the blackmailing because it's literally
their job
in an intelligence agency there's a
gigantic upside
and then the third thing that's
necessary to be guaranteed that it
happens
is that there are a lot of people
involved if there were only
one important person in the world well
there's a pretty good chance they
haven't murdered or
raped anybody but if you have lots of
leaders
you can guarantee some number of them
and it might be a pretty big percentage
like an alarming percentage of them
20 30 and 50 it's a big number
have done at least something they could
be blackmailed for
maybe it's 80 but i would say minimum 30
percent
of leaders have something they could be
blackmailed for
so under those conditions what are the
odds that there
are sexual predators and uh
rapists i guess that's the same um
in government in major in major roles
the answer is a hundred percent a
hundred percent
there's 100 chance that people are in
power are doing bad things
there's a hundred percent chance that
intelligence agencies are trying to find
out about them
there's a hundred percent chance that in
some number of cases they have succeeded
and there's a hundred percent chance
that it makes a difference
that that some intelligence agencies
have leverage over
number of people now that said
if you were to pick any one allegation
about any one person
and here's an example an allegation the
worst possible allegation
against chief justice roberts what are
the odds
that any one specific thing is true
in the context of knowing that the
larger story is definitely true
there definitely are people doing bad
things definitely being blackmailed by
intelligence agencies
probably more than one of them at the
same time
um those two things are not incompatible
so do you hear this it can be definitely
true that it's happening
well almost statistically you know if
you're just going to put an odds on it
any one person who gets accused very low
odds so i would say the odds that chief
justice roberts is actually doing
anything like
any of these allegations vanishingly
small
so small i wouldn't even think of it as
being in the category of things that
might be true
that's how small the odds of this being
true are at the same time
it could be true that there's this stuff
going on but not for the any individual
you can't make that claim so unless he's
got a screenshot of justice roberts
i would not look for that to be true
all right the
epic times is reporting that a
there was a data analysis by something
called the data integrity group so i
guess they do data analysis
and they did a time series uh look at
all the votes coming in on election day
and make the following claim that at
least over 400 000 votes
were switched switched meaning removed i
think
at least subtracted from trump i don't
know if
i don't know if in this context they
mean that it was added to biden or is
just
removed from trump a little unclear but
it doesn't matter for the point
all right the point is and now here's
the payoff
now i've been telling you before that
simplification
is going to be the key because you've
got a whole bunch of complicated claims
about all kinds of things in the
election
they all conflate and did the courts
rule on them or did they only
rule on doctrine of latches and you know
was it only about standing
the whole thing is way too complicated
for the public to understand
what if anybody and i talked about this
is going to sound familiar because i
talked about this in a different context
if anybody in that data analysis world
who's got a claim
can boil that down to one thing that can
be checked
that's going to be powerful because
you've got a whole bunch of claims that
are hard to check
if you could take even one
important thing let's say something that
affected 400 000 votes
if you could boil that one claim of 400
000
votes down to one verifiable
objective fact you just look at it
and if you're not looking at it you
can't tell but if you are looking at it
you know and apparently this group did
that
they they boiled it down to one
simple data fact
that you could just observe now they
make a claim
that in my opinion is probably false
and i'm saying probably just because the
way the world works right
it's not based on anything about the
data integrity group it's not based on
the reporting of the epoch times it's
not based on anything that
it's just if you live in the world long
enough
there are some things you just expect
not to be true in the end
and this sort of fits in that category
but here's the genius part of it
all you have to do is check and i'm
going to tell you what their claim is
and when you see how simple it is
you're actually going to feel it i tell
you this sometimes every once in a while
there will be a little piece of
knowledge
your your your understanding of the
world you live in just goes up a little
bit
like you reach a little higher level of
awareness and sometimes you can feel it
like you'll get a little goosebumps or
something i'm going to do that to some
of you now most of you won't feel it but
some of you are going to feel it
here's your goosebumps here's the claim
that is so simple just check
it goes like this quote there were vote
movements across
all candidates of course you know the
vote is
changing in real time as the candidates
are are getting their votes counted
and they say however we did not see the
same type of negative decrements
meaning votes decreasing in real time
from a total that was
higher to lower to any of the other
candidates
that we saw with president trump's
tallies
and they happened repeatedly the the
trump ones
with no explanation said linda
mclaughlin a member of the group
now that is a very specific
simple claim which the data that they
have available to them
apparently shows now
here's my problem i'm not telling you to
believe this okay
so if it sounds like i'm saying hey this
is a credible one believe this one i'm
not there
i'm not there at all but what i love
about it
is that it's a claim you don't have to
believe or disbelieve
you can just check it all right now
if it's true that only president trump's
vote counts showed several times when
they went down
and nobody else ever ever experienced
even
one issue of where any other vote count
either bidens or anybody else on the
ticket
republican or democrat anybody else if
no other vote count all night ever
showed one decrease
but the trump votes did a number of
times
easy to check right because apparently
they have the data they can just look at
it say okay here it was it decreased
and the other ones didn't now do you
think
if that claim is checked then it would
stand up
oh and somebody's saying in the comments
that it was true across multiple states
i believe that's true that it was not in
one place it was
multiple counties now how do you like
the fact
that this is boiled down to something
that you could just check it
you don't have to wonder now based on
the claim
you should not believe it if all you've
read is the claim
zero credibility just like every other
claim about the election
no credibility but if the other side
doesn't weigh in
and say you idiots there's a perfectly
good reason
why it looked like that was happening
but it really wasn't
i'd wait to hear that but
what if you'd ever hear that because as
linda mclaughlin says that no
explanation has been offered
don't you think that would be something
they'd want to explain
and don't you think it wouldn't be hard
to explain it
if there were an explanation for example
and i'll just
brainstorm what it might be it could be
that they've got different
sources reporting and that every once in
a while there's you know a
an artifact where there's a slight
timing problem
and it looks like something was
decreased but it really wasn't
it was just decreased before it
increased or something
right you could imagine they'd say look
this is normal
we'll show you that it happened in other
elections we'll show you that it
happened to bite into
will show you that it happened to other
candidates a defense would be easy
it would be easy to defend it just tell
tell us why it happened or tell us it
didn't happen
easy so do you think that this
exclusive story in the epic times will
be picked up by all the major media
because now we know
a way to find out for sure if the
election was stolen
isn't that good news we don't have to
wonder
in fact we could probably be sure of it
in 24 hours
all you need is somebody who's got a got
the opposite opinion
about what this data means how somebody
qualified
have them look at the same data and then
tell us what they think
if they look at the data and they have a
good explanation i'm open to that
indeed i'm not only open to it i'm far
more likely to believe the explanation
because
most of these things are going to be
explained away like 95 percent
minimum will be explained away why would
this be different
so i would expect it's not real but
every day we go in which the explanation
the alternate explanation doesn't exist
it's a little harder to believe it's not
real isn't it
now do we live in a world where the news
can just
disappear something this important well
let's talk about the trump phone call
so you all saw the news trump made a
phone call with
i guess was the georgia attorney general
and other people in that
office and job in which he was listing
his
grievances and evidence for why the
election was stolen
and he had a pretty long list of of
things like dead people voting and
people whose
addresses don't check out and there were
places where he claimed that there were
more votes than registered voters etc
now i listen to the entire hour
because i think you need to because if
you're just a clip coming out
you won't know what to believe um but i
listen to the whole hour
and i have a few thoughts number one
the president is very
poorly advised at the moment i mean
shockingly poorly advised now
do i blame the president for thinking
that there are all these irregularities
which have been in my opinion mostly
debunked
in my opinion right there's some room
for opinion on this
but i feel as if he's mixing
claims that have not been debunked and
are definitely worth
looking into and look pretty strong like
this epic times one
i don't know if that's true but it looks
pretty strong and hasn't been debunked
as far as i know
so wouldn't you like to look into that a
little bit of course you would
but by mixing stuff that at least again
just in my opinion
sounds transparently and obviously not
true
somebody's not telling the president the
the truth
there is nobody in his circle at the
moment
who apparently feels safe that they can
say um
you got some strong things you can say
and you got some weak things
and maybe just leave the weak things
alone
because if the strong ones work that's
all you need why would you throw weak
ones in there and
ruin the whole thing so i would say that
for those of you who have been following
the claims
they seemed almost embarrassingly
uninformed so that was my take
now you know from if you've watched me i
could not be a bigger booster
of trump right to the point of a flaw
i'm a booster to the point of flaw
but even i didn't think the stuff he was
saying about the election was
too credible in in whole there were
parts of it that i didn't know and i'd
like to know more about them
definitely stuff to look into but the
way it was interpreted by the news
is uh in the form of a hoax oh here's
the other thing i noticed
he's the president of the united states
i'll be at lame duck
it looks like at this point and he could
not get
the people on that phone call to be even
a little bit
cooperative not at all so
watching the president of the united
states trying to make a
basically a karen phone call and
complain about the service
and he couldn't get the supervisor to
say
anything helpful it was shocking
to see how little power he had how did
it get reported
when we saw how little power the
president has
the the president couldn't even get the
other people to be polite basically
i mean he couldn't get anything out of
him and they're his own party
how is that reported obviously a
dictator
obviously trying to force things through
if you listen to it man that was no
dictator
that was whatever you are when you're
complaining to the dmv
and they're not hearing it that's what
was happening
there was no that wasn't hitler that was
karen complaining and nobody cared that
was it
now it was uh characterized of course as
that he was
you know he was pressuring and it was
illegal and all the
all the bad people say it's illegal he's
pressuring but if you listen to the
whole call
there are a few things that are very
clear number one i would say with
complete confidence and i believed this
before
but the the phone call removes all doubt
and it's this
i'm not a mind reader but that call
makes it
really really clear that trump believes
it was stolen
so if you're thinking to yourself he
doesn't really believe it was stolen
it was some kind of a trick to stay in
power
uh in my mind there's no chance of that
you hear the phone call he absolutely
thinks he got screwed
he's got lots of evidence that he
believes a lot of it i don't
but he's convinced i mean he sounds like
a true believer
and he sells that completely
so if you're worried about uh you know
he's a dictator
that should dispel that because you
didn't see much
dictator stuff going on but the fake
news
cnn has turned it into a scandal because
they need trump
for their ratings and they and here's
the uh
the pattern of how they turn real news
to fake news you see it in this example
and you've seen it a number of other
times
once you see the pattern it's just kind
of funny they use the same trick
first they'll take an audio or a video
tape that's longish and they'll cut out
a quote that's out of context
where have you seen that done you saw
that with the covington kids you saw it
with the fine people hoax
and you saw it with the drinking bleach
or inject injecting disinfectant hoaxes
in each case if you had heard the entire
uh
piece you would have said to yourself uh
that's the opposite of what the news
said
for example in the fine people oaks
before
before the quote that was taken trump
talked about the people who were there
who are not racist just there for the
statues
and then after that he made sure that
you knew that he was condemning totally
the neo-nazis and the
and the racists who were there but if
you take out the the
clarification and also the context they
they started and just show the clip
looks like he called
nazis fighting people if you look at the
covington kids clip all they do is clip
out the parts you know before and after
and it looks like the kid is the
the bad person but if you see the whole
clip it's obvious that the person
he was with or the the guy who claimed
to be a native american or he was i
don't remember the story
you could tell that he was the the
aggressor
likewise with the uh drinking bleach
hoax
if you hear it in all of its context
you're the first part where the
president sets it up as talking about
light as a disinfectant then he talks
about it
and then he clarifies about light
so if you don't hear that he set it up
as light
and then he wrapped it up as light and
all they take out
is injecting uh injecting a
disinfectant that's how they create the
hoax now
the fake edit is not enough by itself
all right that's not bad enough by
itself you you need the other steps and
i'll get to them all right so in the
case of this phone call
what they took in a quote uh they they
took little pieces and a quote and
where he's saying stuff that makes it
sound as if
he's pressuring him to cheat now the
opposite is happening
trump is pressuring him to look into
allegations
to make sure that nobody cheated
that is literally the opposite of asking
him to as cnn reports it
find votes so the second part of this
is that the fake news will use uh
persuasion primers
these are words wit and phrases which if
you hear them
at the same time you've heard the story
for the first time
they prime you to see the story a
certain way these are brainwashing
persuasion primers none of this is an
accident
they know how to do this it's the fourth
time in a row you've seen it
same pattern every time so the the
primer words that they use in this case
are pressured to find votes
here's another way to describe exactly
what you
you heard on the the audio the president
forcefully was promoting his idea
that the people in charge should look
into the allegations of fraud
so that the public can understand that
the election was either clean which
would be good
or they'd find that it wasn't which
would be good in another way
so did that sound like pressuring to
find votes
meaning manufacture you know manufacture
about nothing
did that sound the same because what i
said was just objectively
true you listen to it he's making his
case he's presenting his claims for
fraud
he says we just want a fair vote we just
want to know
i just want you to look into it that's
all
and but if you hear pressured and fine
votes
and you pair it with a clip which
doesn't have the rest of the context
it looks like what a mob boss talking
they they like to use the
things that you've uh that you've
believed before
now because the whole he's a mob boss
was already a meme they just take a meme
that is already active in your mind and
they just attach a new thing to it
it's much easier to attach fake news to
an existing meme
oh he's like a mob boss yeah whenever he
makes a private phone call or thinks
it's private
he talks like a mob boss and here he is
making a phone call
like a mob boss now if you listen to it
there wasn't anything even
close to talking like a mob boss
i mean not even close
to anything like that the tone was not
that
it was just asking for for something to
be looked into that was it
and the the the boldness with which they
they try this is amazing here's some
more phrases from cnn
the president was caught on tape
caught on tape now what do you imagine
is true
of somebody who was caught on tape
well they're guilty what does it mean
to be uh on a a recording if you were
caught there they're signaling that he's
guilty
before they've even told you what the
content is that's a primer
that's that's brainwashing right um
so we use caught on tape no it wasn't
caught on tape
there was simply an audio tape which has
been available to the public
in which not much of anything happened
that's not even close
to being caught and by the way
i prefer presidents who don't get caught
on audio
here's another sentence directly out of
cnn's coverage
that the tape quote exposes the depth
of his corruption suppose you
knew there was a long tape you only
heard one part of it which was something
about
finding votes and then you read cnn
saying that this tape exposes the depth
of his corruption
wouldn't you kind of think that the
parts you didn't hear
were more confirming the depth of his
corruption
nothing like that on the tape not even
close
nothing even in that general category of
corruption
not even close it's just him asking for
data to be looked at
because they've got some claims they
they would like some data to be released
by the state
to make sure the claims are true or
false
just just nothing like exposing the
depth of corruption
he literally just asked questions that's
it
they said it was a smoking gun
anytime you hear any of these phrases
you're you're being brainwashed
these are not news phrases they're not
even close to news
it's just straight up brainwashing at
this point and then step three
they bernstein it so you know you bring
in
uh uh burns bernstein or bernstein
bernstein it's bernstein right so they
bring in bernstein
just to say it's worse than watergate
literally
just to say that now have i taught you
the track
the trick of having a big opening offer
so if you're negotiating which is in a
way similar to persuading
and at least in the way i'm going to use
it now if you start with a big
opening offer it it anchors people to
the first thing they heard
so if i say to you i'm going to sell you
my car and it's worth a quarter of a
million dollars
the first thing you think is there's no
car you drive that's worth a quarter of
a million dollars well you're
that's true it's not worth that or
anywhere near it
but it's the first number you hear so
now i say all right maybe it's not worth
a quarter of a million but
man i'd like to get a hundred thousand
for it now the hundred thousand doesn't
sound
so bad because you got primed with the
250
and even though the thing is only worth
thirty five thousand dollars
used suddenly the hundred doesn't sound
so
bad because you got pride with that 250.
that's what bernstein does
the worse than watergate guy comes in to
give you the first offer
worse than watergate and in your mind
you're like wow
whoa that's big now later
when you get more let's say you get more
information about what was on there
you're already primed so maybe you maybe
you come down a little from worse than
watergate in your mind but you're like
yeah i'm not sure it's quite worse than
watergate
but sounds like it's pretty bad see
so that's how their brainwashing works
start with a big offer it's worse than
watergate
and then it's hard to get you off that
no matter how much data comes out later
they use repetition because if they say
it enough
you'll think it's true if you hear a new
story or item
a hundred times you're going to believe
it's more true than if you heard it once
it's just how your brain is operating
they make you think past the sale
so you've got things like exposing his
depth of corruption or caught on tape
those are manipulation phrases to make
you think past the sale
the sale is whether anything bad
happened
and they're making you think it is
exposing the depth of his corruption
by making you think of all the other
corruption it's like
but they haven't made the sale they're
making you think past it
there's no sale that anything bad
happened
they're making you think all the way to
not only did it happen but it's like
this other stuff
that turns out it didn't happen either
all right then of course you do the mind
reading you know what is the president's
state of mind yeah he's
like he's thinking like a mob boss and
he's trying to pressure this guy
he's not trying to get a justice
no in his mind it's not about justice
because cnn can read his mind you can't
but they can they got pundits with
powers
and they read his mind and they find out
that no
despite all of his words that clearly
and repeatedly say he just wants to know
what happened
and can we see the data please now there
are some
legal reasons it's hard to give them the
data but that's a separate story
but if you mind read them none of that's
happening
he's just trying to be a dictator and
then the most important part which is
disappearing the debunks
so this video which is debunking it
thoroughly
will not be highly highly rated on
social media
and so anybody who's going to do what i
just did
will just sort of get disappeared now
you might say to yourself well that's
cnn
right cnn's crazy but at least people
will go over to fox news and they'll
read the real story
it might even agree with you scott and
they might even be on the same side
so you go over to this fox news and you
look for the story and
uh good luck finding it
now i don't know what's up with fox news
but i would think this would be
like one of the big stories as opposed
to
not mentioned so
take that for whatever it means i would
think this one would be mentioned
but must be a story there i i'm sure fox
news will cover it eventually and the
opinion
the opinion shows later today we'll
cover it of course
but it's sort of suspiciously not there
at the moment
unless it happened in the last hour um
all right here's so here's some more uh
cnn
bad behavior they also say quote legal
experts say
trump broke the law by pressuring blah
blah blah blah
well if he pressured him maybe he broke
the law i don't know what law they're
talking about
but if he was just talking to him and
asking for data is that breaking the law
so here so here's cnn acting like a law
has been broken
when you can just listen to the tape and
it's obvious no laws are broken
um all right here's another story just
because the simulation
loves us and gives us lots of code reuse
all six members of the congressional
group we call the squad
you know the progressives aoc etc uh
they all voted to
put nancy pelosi over the top as speaker
unanimous they were
so nancy pelosi must be doing something
right the squad loves her
now i have to admit when i first saw
that the phrase lizard
squad was trending i thought well that's
not a nice thing to call
aoc and the other people and in that
squad
i feel it's unkind to call them the
lizard squad
but it turns out that lizard squad was a
different squad
i got that wrong lizard squad was the
hackers
as opposed to the squad who are also
lizards but they go by a different name
uh also lizards because they're part of
congress not because they're
see see this taken out of context
imagine that quote becomes the part they
take out of my
my live stream and miss the part where i
say no it's because they're in congress
they're lizards
it's not because it's these you know few
few people in the squad that are lizards
they're all lizards
but you take that part out um
my uh twitter friend zach says that uh
watching the biden presidency is gonna
be like watching a bad spin-off
of a tv show you know the trump tv show
is just so awesome and
top-rated show but then you know they do
the spin-off of the minor characters
so it's like trump was the tv show
friends
and biden is going to be like joey you
know
the spin-off show about just joey it's
like
yeah we're gonna watch it by
habit and reflex and maybe it'll remind
us of friends
but it's not friends it's not friends
all right um here's a little uh
tip for you uh i don't know how much
how much backing this has by science but
there was a study
saying that if you drink alcohol um soon
after getting the vaccination it will
make the vaccination
way less effective there's something
about alcohol that makes the
the meds in the vaccination a little
less active so don't drink alcohol
within several days of getting the
vaccination
so you have all been made more safe by
watching this live stream
um here's a question for you remember
howard schultz who was the founder of
starbucks
and he was running for president for a
while what if he had been elected
would howard schultz could you trust him
to make decisions about whether
starbucks should be open
how do you do that i feel as if
howard schultz although i have lots of
confidence in him as a
you know a smart operator and capable
and all that
i have only only good thoughts about him
but
he would be in quite a bind wouldn't he
because one of the biggest questions in
the pandemic is
does a place like starbucks stay open or
just go out of business
how could he make that decision or even
be part of it or i mean i
i don't see how that would have worked
but
you know short of having a pandemic he
would have been fine
but as soon as it's a pandemic he's the
wrong match for the job right
remember i've told you that there's no
such thing as bad presidents and good
presidents
they're just presidents who
coincidentally are matched for a task
trump perfectly matched for a whole
bunch of tasks mostly international
but uh howard schultz would have been a
bad match
for a pandemic just because you would
never know if he was doing something
because of starbucks you just wouldn't
be able to know that
uh and i'm not casting any aspersions on
schultz like i said i have only good
feelings about him
but it'd be a bad position to put him in
gordon chang who
talks quite a bit about north korean
chinese an expert in that region
is recommending that we cut all ties
with china
think about that cut all ties with china
now gordon chang is not random crazy guy
on twitter he knows what he's talking
about
and if gordon chang is telling you we'd
better cut
all ties with china you need to take
that seriously
now i know that the president listens to
him so he probably is taking you
seriously
and it's not very easy i mean no i and i
made the case just
briefly when we say all ties with china
it's because every interaction we have
with them
is militarily bad for the united states
i say militarily
because anything that kills americans at
the hands of our
enemy that we're in a hot war with it's
a cyber war but it's a hot war
anything that your enemy does to kill
people in your country is an act of war
so whether it's they send us fentanyl
they do trade deals that are illegal
they steal our ip they send spies over
you know you can just go down the list
every contact with china is militarily
negative
to the united states so we should
de-list their companies from the stock
exchange
president did that we should send all of
their uh
their residents home that are trying to
get educations here
we should stop trading with them we
should bring all of our
we should have an order to bring all of
our companies home
now um and i don't i just don't know
oh and this other news thing is that
jack
ma the founder of alibaba and
multi-multi
hundreds of billions i don't know he's
super rich guy
um i guess he criticized the regime and
he disappeared
so far for a week now it's really hard
for a billionaire to disappear
if somebody like you know elon musk or
you know bill gates were not seen for a
week and it were a national story
it wouldn't take long to find him you
know hey he was at the retreat or he
just
took some break from social media or
something but it's been a week
and we don't know where one of the
richest people in china is and very
public guy
like jack ma is always on tv he's like
very public
so what if he never shows up
because that's possible we might never
see him again
he could be making shoes and with the
uyghurs right now
anything could happen now i imagine he
will turn up soon but his
attitude will be adjusted is my guess i
think the regime
probably will talk to him and say you
know if you'd like to stay
oh alive and a billionaire
let me tell you how to do it and it's
not the way you're playing it right now
but the other thing that's interesting
is that jack ma is no
ordinary guy whatever it was
that turned him into one of the richest
people in the world was not an
accident he's got skills
and he's got billions of dollars
and skills and did i mention skills
and here's my question as strong as the
chinese communist party is
i mean it's immensely strong i don't
know if they're messing with the right
person right now
because if he's already got a little
problem with the leadership
and they're doing something with him
right now
you don't want to let him out let me say
this
a different way if china is doing
something bad
to jack ma they better finish him
because you don't want that guy loose
with his billions
and really really mad at the regime
because he is important
you know he has enough probably inside
knowledge
contacts people he could bribe he could
probably take down the government
because i think that any any billionaire
in this country who was like really
serious about taking down the government
could have a good shot at it now china
of course
you assumed that they would close him
down the minute he tried anything he'd
obviously have to leave the country
and he'd have to get most of his money
out if he could but if he gets out of
the country with his money
and they tortured him jack ma
could take down china i think they've
got a dangerous situation on their hands
i don't think they can ever let him out
if they're doing something bad to him
now they might reach some agreement
where they don't do something too bad
maybe just some house arrest
and then when they've talked to him
enough he just feels like i don't want
to go through this again
it wasn't that bad it was just house
arrest for a week
but i don't you know next time it could
be bad so i just won't say bad things
about china
i would think that's the way it's going
to go i i think that he's a smart guy
and they'll just figure something out
and he'll just shut up about china
but did i mention
he's jack ma now i don't know much about
him i just know that you don't you don't
get where he is
by not having skill not being brave
not doing things that people don't
expect not being able to push through a
brick wall
as if it didn't exist so i don't know
you know what is real capabilities are
but one assumes they're pretty good
china might be in trouble we'll see that
is my show for the day and i've got some
things to do so i'm gonna
run off and do those things uh somebody
says zuckerberg
took down trump you could make that
argument yeah you know there were there
were too many other variables to isolate
one thing but if
zuckerberg and facebook did not exist
trump would probably be president i mean
that's that's not a reasonable and
unreasonable thing to think
all right i hope you enjoyed this
episode and
uh i will talk to you tomorrow
all right youtubers you've got another
minute
uh why do you think the trump tape was
leaked well it was because
his enemies probably thought that they
could uh
make something out of it now the
interesting part is that a lot of people
are going to hear
the president make a lot of claims about
election fraud
so there's at least some
thought that maybe the president's team
released it
because by turning it into national news
which just has to be covered
uh all of his allegations get out there
so it might be good for the president to
do that
explain lead stories i don't know what
that means
calendar drama so uh as somebody pointed
out
on twitter the dilbert calendar is
printed in china
and so the question was hey if uh if uh
what's this chappelle can get netflix to
take
his old show off the air can't i get
my publisher to use a different printing
company
that's not exactly a good analogy if i
were chappelle
and i had an ancient show that i
probably made little or no money on
at this point and all all that
all netflix had to do is just you know
click a box and it doesn't appear
anymore
because it's probably as simple as that
right just click a box and that
that little part of their business just
doesn't exist anymore
probably doesn't make much difference to
chappelle because the way hollywood
um deals are made even though it was his
show i doubt he had profits going
forward
i doubt it or if he did there weren't
much so he didn't give up anything
so chappelle basically gave up nothing
of any value
and in order to for netflix to give him
what he wanted
they probably just had to check a box
and they couldn't even tell the
difference in their profits because it's
one
of you know thousands and thousands of
properties
by comparison my publisher i believe
does
all of their printing for all of their
properties in china
it's not easy for them to stop doing
that right away
they can't just check a box and then
there's no printing in china
do you have any idea how hard it would
be for a major publishing company
to change where they publish all of
their books
it's a big deal now this is why i
promote an
executive order that just orders
companies out of china
american companies because your
publisher
it's not really fair to ask a publisher
why don't you decrease your profits by
30 percent
and spend your entire next year trying
to figure out how to do this thing that
there probably isn't even enough
capacity in the united states to get
done
or you know you'd have to take it
somewhere so
the the chappelle thing was the smallest
possible ask there's no real cost
i mean immeasurably small and just check
a box
mine would be an entire publishing
company working for a year
changing everything that they do maybe
there would be no dilbert calendars that
would make a big impact on me
it's not the same thing but i'm on board
with getting the dilbert calendar out of
china so if you if you wonder if you
wonder what i want
it's that but i also work in the real
world
and it's not really fair to ask a
publisher to make that kind of a change
until it's either legally necessary
or there's some kind of alternative that
doesn't look so bad you know do it in
vietnam or wherever
so that's where i stand on that all
right uh and i will talk to you
tomorrow
