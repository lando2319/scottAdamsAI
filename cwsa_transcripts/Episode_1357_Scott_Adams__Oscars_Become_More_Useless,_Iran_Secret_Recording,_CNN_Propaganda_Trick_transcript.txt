well ignore the sound of my
printer going nuts over there it's time
for coffee with scott adams the best
hard time of the day every single day
no exceptions
and if you'd like to enjoy it and why
wouldn't you really
well all you need is a copper mug of
glass a tanker gels just die in a
canteen jugger flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
you know it is it's called the
simultaneous sip
and it's gonna happen right now all over
the world simultaneously
go
ah that's so good
so good well i finally reached 100 000
subscribers
on youtube yay maybe that'll make a
difference
we'll see what else is happening
i hear there was something called an
oscars
last night i have a vague memory of
something about that being relevant in
the past
but these days movies are nothing but
self-indulgent
crap that nobody should spend money on
or
spend hours watching i don't think
there's any reason to watch a movie
anymore
the whole industry doesn't make any
sense and so the oscars had a
self-congratulatory party
in which they all celebrated their
wokeness
and the uh immense shittiness of their
products
and i don't know if anybody watched did
anybody watch
is there anybody here who watched the
oscars just
anybody i remember what it used to be
sort of a must-see tv and and now it's
closer to
musk nazi i tell you you would have to
pay me to watch a movie
like actually you would have to give me
money
to watch a two and a half hour movie
because they're not even trying to make
these
entertaining anymore they're trying to
win oscars
and that means everybody's got to be sad
and droopy and
bad things happen until you go home
feeling like you want to kill yourself
so movies don't make any sense they're
all crap
don't watch them if i haven't told you
before
there's a site called ground news
that tracks blind spots in the news
coverage
so if somebody on the left or let's say
all the news outlets on the left have a
story
but everybody on the right is not
covering it or vice versa
you can see that and here's a really
good example
i tweeted it but you most of you heard
the news
that the newest cdc uh
advice or this there was a study that
showed that it doesn't matter if you're
six feet away or sixty feet away it's
all the same
it's no risk as six feet and
that seemed like good news for
everybody wasn't it was that good news
only for
conservatives it seems like that would
be good news
for everybody but only the conservative
media
covered it the left completely ignored
it
why because it doesn't fit their
narrative of what they want the public
to do
it was true information that was useful
and relevant
and they didn't report it because they
didn't want you to know it
i assume they wouldn't want you to know
that it was that safe
because it it works against the
narrative that you gotta
get a mask up and and hide inside
so when you see something like that it's
it's a reminder that the news is not the
news
it's a narrative it's about managing
your actions it's not about what you
know
so that's why that happens
let me ask you when you heard the news
and i say
news with with quotes
when you heard the news that joe biden's
climate change plan
would limit americans to one hamburger
per month
was there any point at which you believe
that to be true
because if at any point
you saw that news that said that the
biden plan would limit you to one
hamburger a month
and you thought that might be true you
really need to examine your
your gullibility because that was so
obviously not true from the first moment
you didn't really need to wait for
details on that one
i i saw the headline and i said all
right uh
let's see 24 hours until that's
completely debunked
done completely debunked the fact
checker said nope
nothing like that no requirement like
that
so here is my rule for that
this is the scott alexander rule not
not the scott adams rule and it goes
like this
if there's a new if there's a story in
the news
that's just a little bit too on the nose
and a little bit too crazy like you say
to yourself
my god that couldn't possibly be true
the next thing you should say to
yourself is oh it probably isn't
because you'll be right about 98 of the
time
if you're if your first instinct is i'm
not sure that's true
go with it you'll be right 98
of the time so when i heard this story
my first instinct was
nope nope there's no chance that's true
and sure enough it's debunked
i saw a question on the internet today
are humans evolving to be
smarter in other words
especially with modern education and
modern everything
are we are we accelerating how smart
people are getting
are we evolving to be smarter
because i don't think we are
i feel like maybe it's working in the
other direction a little bit
feels like it now it's misleading
because when you look at say the
writings of the ancients
the only ones you're going to see are
the most educated smartest people
so it might feel like the they were
smarter back then
but i asked the question how is it that
we can't figure out how to build a
pyramid
without modern tools because
the egyptians figured out how to build a
pyramid without modern tools
but we don't know how to do it how about
those big
heads on easter island not quite so sure
how to do that are we
well i would just like to put that out
there that maybe people in general
are getting dumber and there would be
reasons for that
because our technology is beaming
stupidity right into our brains
probably a good third of the country
believes they can't eat more than one
hamburger next year right
so think about all the people who
believe the hamburger story
did they get smarter or did they get
dumber they got dumber right because the
fake news
is just not true so to the extent that
you believe any fake news
you're getting dumber now in the old
days they didn't have
as robust a 24-hour news situation
so i imagine that they were fed
less fake news now of course they knew
less science was
backwards etc but i've got a feeling
that we're actually making people stupid
that our technology is targeting the
weak and just turning them dumber
and less capable at the same time
that you know that would be more of an
average but at the same time the
smartest people are
more easily finding each other because
if you're smart
you just look for another smart person
and technology lets you find them pretty
quickly
so if the smartest people are marrying
the smartest people
and that's largely true because they
don't want to you know if you're really
smart you'll need to be with smart
somebody else who's smart they're going
to have smart kids
and so we're going to have one segment
of society
that's sort of uh hyper evolving to
extra smartness while the rest of
society is consuming fake news and
getting dumber
the the difference in you know iqs is
going to become
a problem i mean you could argue it
already is
but i think the fact that in the old
days you ended up marrying whoever was
nearby
guaranteed the smart people were usually
going to marry dumb people
because there were more dumb people than
smart people and you just married
whoever was available and nearby
but once you can look for another smart
person you're going to have these
ultra smart people who have bred ultra
smart kids or
maybe those kids will have problems i
don't know
uh
i i i think i'll i'm just gonna block
you
dean just for being an all-caps guy
timeout for you all right
um so
here's a little update on the matt gates
sex scandal how about all those details
huh
none how about all those witnesses that
came forward
none how about all the confirmed
uh illegal acts that are part of the
story
none three weeks
nothing does that bother you
three weeks this story's been out there
and
nothing nothing confirmed no
human being who confirmed it
nothing now that doesn't mean that it
won't happen
i'm just saying this looks a little bit
unusual doesn't it
so keep an eye on this uh as david
reboy i hope i'm saying that right reboy
said in american greatness that indeed
this might be the longest running quote
sex scandal in the nation's history
without an accuser
there's no accuser i mean publicly that
we know about
amazing more than 500 federally funded
scientists
in the united states are under
investigation for being compromised by
china and other foreign powers
the nih said 500
of our scientists might be in the pocket
or at least influenced by
china that's pretty scary
don't you think we ought to do something
about that as
in china should not be giving any money
to anybody in our
universities um i think maybe we should
uh
tighten that up a little bit
on face the nation so some big news
happened do you know what makes big news
it's when something happens that you
think shouldn't happen
it's not news when somebody just does
something well
that's not news but if something's like
way out of the box you know like a
like a man bites a dog that's news you
know dog bites man
not so much ordinary but i faced the
nation
here's the big news they put a
politician on tv
who told the truth and that was
national news i'm not joking
a politician told the truth on
television
and it became national news
here's the specific truth former
orlando police chief representative val
demings
so when she was asked about the the
shooting of
makia bryant and that was the young
woman who had the knife
who was killed by the officer who was
responding as she was in the
act of it looked like in the act of
stabbing the other woman and
she said she looked at the footage and
basically said it appears the officer
responded as he was trained to do
what are you allowed to tell the truth
on tv
i didn't know that we i didn't know you
could do that
so even though she's a democrat
she decided that i guess given given
that she's a former orlando police chief
she just couldn't go on television like
the other politicians
and just lie about it so she decided to
go on television and just tell a simple
obvious truth
and telling the truth on television
makes it world news
it's a headline because she told the
truth that's it
there's no new information you didn't
learn
anything nothing nothing was revealed
she simply told the truth and it's
national news
let me just think about that that's what
makes news
uh there's more uh criticism of dr
fauci from some circles it's being said
that he's flip-flopping again about
whether you need
masks outdoors but i guess the cdc will
come up with some new guidelines that
will exercise
common sense so i think we're going to
be a little bit freer outdoors
i don't know about where you live but
where i live
so it's a suburban area if you were to
take a walk
down a typical neighborhood sidewalk
you might run into nobody coming the
other direction
like in your entire walk maybe one
person
coming the other direction today
that one person all by themselves
outdoors
will usually have a mask on where i live
now i don't wear a mask to walk outdoors
right you know the the exception is
if i go downtown because the sidewalks
are packed with people sometimes
and that's even that's more just to be
polite
but there's a weird thing happening
which is
have you ever been in this situation
where uh you walk up to a door and
you're with some other people and you've
got to hold the door
let's say you're a man and you're going
to hold the door for another man
and the other guy says no after you then
you go no after you
no after you no after you and
and men do this about picking up the
check as well i don't know if women do
it i don't observe that as much
but men will be like oh i'll pick up the
check no it's my turn no
it's my turn and masks have kind of
turned into that
you'll see people try to out polite you
with masks because really now it's just
about politeness
the outdoor masking i don't think
anybody believes it makes a difference
but it makes you look like you're the
most polite person
so i'll be walking down the sidewalk and
i'll think oh okay i'll just sort of get
off the sidewalk
when i'm passing them give them you know
give them six feet
because i don't have a mask on but in my
head i'm thinking
i'm just doing it to be polite i'm not
really doing it because i think it's
safer
i'm doing it because i don't know if
they're worried about it
so it's just a courtesy but other people
are trying to out courtesy
me so they'll they'll like wear two
masks and run across the street because
they're
extra courteous i don't think it's about
safety anymore
i believe that a hundred percent of
outdoor mask wearing
is not is not just signaling
because that's what you i'm seeing in
the comments somebody says virtue
signaling
i don't think that's what it is i think
it used to be maybe
but now i think it's just people trying
to out polite other people
that's it i don't think it's virtue
signaling so much as being out polite
i guess you could say that's virtue but
this is a specific guide
all right there's an interesting
recording of iran's a foreign minister
uh so this was a released recording that
he didn't know was going to be released
this was zarif
the foreign minister now here's the
first question you must ask
how do we get a how do we get a
recording of
the foreign minister of iran talking
candidly
in a private scenario or at least off
the record
how do we get that clearly i would say
there is somebody or some people
within the iranian hierarchy
who are not so a pro-iranian
hierarchy may want some change so
there does seem to be some continuing
evidence that
at least israel knows way too much about
the inner workings of iran
so it would seem that iran is completely
compromised
in terms of sources and insiders and
et cetera so that's got to worry them
but if you recall
when uh president trump ordered the uh
the assassination i guess you'd call it
or the
the missile strike with the drone on
solomon a the
the general who was running things over
there do you remember what i
said about that situation remember
everybody
a lot of smart people were saying hey
this is going to cause a big war in iran
and what did i say does anybody remember
does anybody remember what i predicted
about that
what i predicted was that solomony
was probably not too popular
carpe it's all about politeness our
church dropped the mass suggestion last
week
one person was wearing one on sunday
yeah it is about politeness
because if as soon as you tell people
they don't have to wear it
they take them off so you know it wasn't
about safety
because the moment they have permission
and it's polite to take off their mass
they take
them off anyway thanks for the comment
carpe and
anyway back to the saran thing so they
must be terribly compromised
but as i predicted when solomony was
taken out by trump
i said i'm not so sure that the iranian
leadership
is mad about that do you remember that
was i the only person who said that as
far as i know there wasn't anybody else
in the world that i heard
did you i mean i'll if you heard
somebody else say it let me know
but i don't think anybody else said hey
hold on to this i think iran is going to
have a muted response because they might
be happy about him being gone
and it turns out that when we hear the
secret tapes from this insider
zarif they were not too happy with him
apparently he was sort of acquiring too
much power
making decisions outside of the outside
of the leadership of the country and
and they didn't like it
and so i think i'm the only person who
got this right
that iran itself the leadership anyway
would have mixed feelings about one of
their top generals being assassinated
and sure enough their response was kind
of small
right they had to do a little something
and they did
but kind of a small response and now we
know from the insider that
they might have been a little happy
about that the other thing we learned is
that
russia apparently was trying to kill
any kind of iranian deal with the united
states that would be good for both iran
and the united states
think about that i mean just think about
that
russia actively basically was spoiling
relations between the united states and
iran
because of course they would like iran
to be more in their camp
as would china and zarif was even
complaining
that the current situation makes iran
depend on russia
and depend on china how would you like
to depend on russia and china
and those are your two options it turns
out iran doesn't like that
do you know what they would really like
to depend a little bit more in the
united states
to have a little bit of competition
there so they don't have to depend on
china they could do something with us
make a little competitive situation
surprised no it turns out that what iran
would like and really like
is to do more business with the united
states
somebody says where is this recording
well look on my twitter feed you'll see
some links
to stories and then i think i don't know
if you'll hear it
because it wouldn't be in english so i
don't know uh
and if you're doubting whether it exists
or it's accurate
i like i like where you're heading on
this i think
it's accurate the story but if so
if there's somebody out there doubting
whether it's even true i like how you're
thinking
because it could be not true it's
possible i just think it probably is
but i'm i'm biased so
i feel as if we've never been this close
to doing something useful with iran now
of course we can't let them
keep their you know building nukes etc
but i feel like they really want a deal
and i don't think that you know if if
they were not worried about their
you know integrity of their country i'm
not so sure they wouldn't want to work
with the united states
maybe you have to wait for the ayatollah
to to pass on
but i feel like we're this close
you know i've said it before we're only
one ayatollah away from peace
that's not necessarily true because the
next you know the next leader might be
worse you never know but i feel like
i feel like it's ready to tip in our
direction
um so here's some persuasion updates
in 2014 48 of the country believed
global warming was caused by human
activity
so fewer than half but fast forward from
2014 to 2020
of course it's a little dated already
and we're up to
57 so now it's a clear majority
believe global warming is caused in part
by human activity
the biden states are 59
agreeing with that while the trump
states are at 52
which is not that far away so whether
whether a state went for
trump or biden in the last election
they're both
more than half of them believe that
global warming is caused by human
activity
some some part of it and then 43 percent
believe it will harm them personally
so the question of whether it exists
separate from the question of whether
it'll harm them personally
so more people think it's a thing than
think it will hurt them personally
sounds about right doesn't it sounds
about right
um
but here's now here's the punchline to
it all
so this was an nbc article i was reading
and then the article
says but the extreme weather events of
the past few years from hurricanes and
floods to deep trouts and wildfires
might have played a role in other words
the speculation
is that is that people saw all these big
weather events
fires and hurricanes they tied it to
climate change
and it made more people believe that
climate change was a problem
and that it was real but
do you see any problem with this
it turns out and do a fact check me out
here
but isn't the uh the disaster
evidence the least reliable
of all the evidence in fact it's sort of
in question whether we can see the
signal
for climate change in any of this right
i need a fact check on this because i
think there's some disagreement
among scientists my understanding is
that
even the climate scientists don't see a
clear signal that these these big events
are caused by climate change
can somebody fact check me on that so
just that there's some disagreement on
that
that's the last i knew unless it's been
updated so in other words
people are persuaded by the thing that
is least
true or at least we have the lowest
confidence that we can see it in the
data
but it's visual it's visual
there's pictures of hurricanes or
pictures of fires
you know i i breathe the smoke
people see the cleanup as soon as you
turn something visual the persuasion
goes through the roof
so i think all we're seeing here is that
the disasters are visual
and even though they should be the least
persuasive part of the argument
compared to stronger evidence it's the
most persuasive
i mean that's just how crazy people are
that the lowest credibility thing
is the most persuasive it probably is
because it's visual
all right um apparently europe
is uh talking about letting people visit
if you're fully vaccinated
this summer so i don't know that there
will ever be
government requirements in the united
states for any vaccinations
or for any passports i tend to think not
but a lot of people are going to want it
a lot of people are going to want to
prove that they got their vaccinations
just for private reasons
private business reasons so here's a big
change speaking of persuasion
fareed zacario on cnn
is strongly in favor of nuclear power
as as really the only hope
or something that's necessary let's say
for uh
remediating climate change so even a
major cnn
personality is saying yeah nuclear is
the only way to go forward
if you want to if you want to take care
of a host of problems
that feels like a big deal doesn't it
and i've said before that there's no
such thing as a good
president they're only presidents that
fit the situation better
and i would say that biden might be
exactly the right president
because he could convince the left
trump would never be able to convince
the left to do nuclear
because it's trump biden is already
sort of lukewarm on nuclear so he
wouldn't be
going against anything he's ever said
before and he could convince
democrats to go with it i think and he
could make it a green thing and i think
he could make it work
so i think this is one of those cases
where biden is actually
weirdly probably the right person
you know i i said for four years that
trump should have made lots more noise
about nuclear
a big mistake in my opinion i think his
administration did a lot
and really good stuff so the department
of energy a plus for
you know pushing nuclear in all the
smart ways
forward but i didn't see trump speaking
out at all
really i don't remember even one time he
might have
uh so that's you know we're seeing the
persuasion work in the right direction
there
uh here's an example of some cnn
propaganda and i want to
i want to call out the technique because
you see this technique a lot
you'll see it more on fox news if i'm
being honest
so you'll see the technique a little bit
more on the fox opinion channels
or the the opinion shows but here's the
cnn version of it
just to be fair that they're not the
only ones who do this trick
they make three statements about uh the
uh 2020 election and here's the trick
the first statement you will recognize
as true
the second statement you'll say well
that's true-ish
not completely true true but it's
in that direction of true-ish and then
the third one is just complete
just complete so that's the
technique
one you agree with one that's
pushing your credibility a little bit
but you might still agree with it
and then the third one is the persuasion
complete
but since the other two felt kind of
compatible with your thinking
you you go to the third one yeah hannity
is the one who does it the most
hannity is an expert at this by the way
and
every time you see hannity do a a fast
talking
list look for this trip this trick
where he'll start with things that are
clearly true
true true true and then he throws one in
that has no backing whatsoever it's just
an opinion
but it's on the list of true things all
right let me
so let me tell you what the things are
the cnn used for their technique now
this is an
opinion piece and the context is this
uh that the title is that title of the
article is trump still
constantly lying about 2020. so that's
how they frame it
and it says most trump supporters still
believe his lies about 2020.
according to recent polling and then
they talk about blah blah blah
76 percent of republicans think there
was quote widespread fraud in the
election
76 what do i tell you about all polls
and 25 percent of people who answer
25 of people who answer polls will just
be whack
it doesn't matter what the question is
you can always depend
on 25 of any public
just being completely clueless and and
just being dumb really
so uh anyway 76 believe that
there was widespread fraud in the
election so here are the three
statements
in this list from cnn number one there
is no proof
of massive vote rigging true
right a lot of you have suspicions and
you've seen
you've seen statistics and things like
that you've heard stories
but as far as i know this is completely
true there is no proof
of massive vote rigging right
would you agree with that yet now that's
different from saying it exists or
doesn't exist
saying there's no proof is very specific
and i think very true
i'm going to say i'll give 100 that
that we don't have like a publicly
acknowledged
proof of such thing true then the next
one
a little bit less true a little bit less
true maybe
let's see audits in key states confirm
the accuracy of the results
huh is that true
did the audits and key states confirm
the accuracy of the results
or did they only
confirm the accuracy of the audit
uh right because an audit
is specific to what they're looking at
right i don't believe there was an audit
of
all the election now if somebody did an
audit of
all all parts of the election from the
electronic part to
every part of the ballots then i would
say
that you could say depending on how the
audit came out
you could say that those audits
confirmed the accuracy of the results
but we didn't do that kind of audit did
we
nope so this one is like
uh we confirmed the accuracy of
the results the results is sort of where
the persuasion is starting to come in
because all they did is confirm the
accuracy
of the thing they audited that's not the
accuracy of the election
just on the thing they audited all right
and then they go to the third one and
here's where it just completely leaves
the field of of evidence
number three and elected officials from
both parties
so it must be pretty true because both
parties are saying it
said the vote was free and fair
how do they know what kind of evidence
is that
that the officials from both parties
said the vote was free and fair
let me explain to you how the world
works
let's say you go to the people in charge
of
the voting integrity for a democrat
state and you say to them hey democrat
how was the voting integrity of the
election that went the way you would
like it to
what would the democrat official say in
that situation
totally fair and free election and also
it went the way we wanted it to
could you expect anything else i don't
think so
since it was that person's job to make
sure the the election was good
you're really asking people to give you
their own opinion of how well they did
at their job
people often say you know now that you
mentioned it i did a pretty bad job at
election integrity and we don't even
know who voted
nobody says that it's completely
ridiculous
they ask the people who are guarding the
hen house if the head house was guarded
because they're going to say yes now
let's say you talk to the republicans
what would happen if a republican whose
job it was
to manage the integrity of the election
they're asked how did you do did you
manage the integrity of the election
even the republicans going to say yes i
did
because that was their job of course
they're gonna say it was a
it was a good job it's the job they did
who says i did a bad job all right so
so so here's the three again just so you
can see it there's no proof of massive
vote rigging
completely true audits in key states
confirmed the accuracy of the results
the results no just the accuracy of the
stuff they audited
and then the last one election officials
from both parties that said the vote was
free and fair
do they know would they know
of course not i mean they could know if
we all knew i mean if there was some
some obvious thing
they would know we'd know the news would
know if it was some obvious thing
but if you're asking the wrong people
how are you going to get the right
answer
these are these are probably the wrong
people to ask and and politicians are
going to give you the answer
that gets them reelected right so it's
the least credible group you could ever
you ever imagine but if you were a cnn
viewer and you were sort of
not a critical thinker you would look
down here and say well this is pretty
pretty convincing that trump's lying and
look at all this evidence that he's
lying it's right here there's three good
evidences but in fact there is not
all right here's another fake news story
except i can't tell which way the fake
goes it's either fake that is happening
or fake that is not
and that is this uh conservative
representative marjorie taylor-green
allegedly was going to launch this
caucus called america first
caucus and i guess her office had
confirmed that she was working on this
etc and then some kind of a flyer came
out
which people are calling a first draft
that got released
accidentally and this flyer about this
alleged america first caucus
which may or may not be a real thing
it's a little unclear now
apparently the first draft had this
statement
in a flyer it says it called for a
common respect
for uniquely anglo-saxon anglo-saxon
political traditions
do you catch that do you believe
that there were uh elected officials
even marjorie taylor green who you know
to be
you know pretty extreme in terms of what
she's willing to do in public and
willing to say
but do you believe that even she
would put out a document that said
they're fighting for a
common respect for uniquely anglo-saxon
political traditions
who would write that i mean really
who in the world would write that on a
document and think that that would be
okay to release it
now i spend about half of my time on
this
uh on these live streams saying that the
accusations of racism are usually
overblown
and it's political and it's not really
race
but how in the world would any elected
official think it would be okay to put
in a document saying we should stick
with our anglo-saxon traditions
i don't believe that anybody associated
with thinking about this
platform or caucus i don't believe that
they would have written that down
i don't know what they were thinking but
i don't believe that
that anybody who is you know an elected
official would have used these terms
now somebody says what the hell is wrong
with that
really is there anybody else who wants
to
who needs an answer to what the hell is
wrong with it i want to see in the
comments
if anybody is on that same side
define anglo-saxons
what's wrong with that people are saying
that it's british what's wrong with me
what's wrong with the british tradition
i'm looking at more of your comments and
see where you're on on this
it's not it's not true scott yeah i
think
i think that this flyer thing may be
not true um it's exclusionary somebody
says
it means english common law somebody
says so a lot of you
are sort of uh okay with this right
let me ask you this if you're not
white how does this sound to you
now i get it that you don't want to be
politically correct about everything
but would you at least agree with me
that saying stupid things in public
doesn't help anybody
right would you agree they're saying
stupid things
even if you think you know you want the
right etc
it doesn't help anybody to be stupid in
public
this is really stupid this is like super
stupid
you i can't even call it racist because
it goes beyond racism to just stupidity
really because there were a lot of ways
to say this
that would not sound racist now i'm
going to
use the phrase sound racist
because if what they're arguing is that
we have a
a culture that evolved that's a good one
that's a good argument but to put this
uh
anglo-saxon label on it even though i
know that's where it came from
even though i know it's it's a it's
accurate
even though i know scientifically data
wise
factually it's just statements of fact
i'll agree with you but how could you be
dumb enough not to think
this was just shooting yourself in the
foot
there was no other better way to say
this than the one way that sounds like
white supremacy
there's something totally wrong with the
story so when
marjorie taylor green called it a first
draft
i would certainly find out who wrote
that first draft
and i would like to find out if it's
somebody who is on her side
or somebody who's trying to take her out
because this reads more like somebody
trying to take her out
because that would take her out right
and maybe it will because if you believe
that
she was behind anything that said you
know we need to
pursue our common respect for
anglo-saxon political traditions
that would pretty much take her out of
the race for the future
now remember i'm being very very careful
here
i'm not criticizing the factual accuracy
that it's an anglo-saxon tradition and
i'm not saying there's anything
wrong with it because it seems to have
worked up until now
i'm just saying that if you're a an
elected official
and you basically go in front of the
world and she didn't do this right she's
she's disavowing this language but
to imagine that anybody would say yeah
we're gonna we're gonna just do white
culture because that's the good one
yeah we'll call it anglo-saxon but what
we really mean
is white culture who in the world thinks
that's a good idea
now you might like the culture but would
you say it that way
in a country where people are hyper
sensitive about where things came from
and you know who gets credit and
racial stuff it would be the dumbest
thing anybody ever said
and so it's not even clear at this point
whether they
were serious about this america first
caucus or or what
but let me tell you anybody who is so
dumb
that they would use this phrase
anglo-saxon even though it's accurate
even though there's nothing wrong with
it it just
it's you might as well let me say what
this would be equivalent to
using this term the anglo-saxon
political traditions
would be like saying you wanted to wear
a kkk
robe and hood but not because you're
making a political statement
rather you like the the fashion and and
arguing that
no no it's just a fashion statement i'm
not even in the ku klux klan i just like
this look and you know you might
misinterpret it and i think that's on
you you know there's some things that
are just so
obviously dumb and that would be one of
them
this is another one you can't really
treat it as anything but dumb
so very dumb um but
that said i do think that we completely
undervalue as a country we undervalue
the uh economic value of
culture i do think
that if we don't protect
the american culture and i think that it
can
it can evolve over time it doesn't have
to be stuck in one time
but i think we we have to treat it
differently here's how i would treat
it the same topic i would make it a rate
of change argument
rate of change the same thing i would
say about immigration in general
is that immigration is neither good nor
bad
there is a rate that's good and there's
a rate of immigration that's bad
but not immigration immigration itself
is not good or bad
it's just the rate that makes it good or
bad
likewise with this cultural evolution
let's say because the culture always
evolves it can never stay the same
but i would say that if culture evolves
too quickly
you're in real trouble if it evolves
at a managed you know in a managed way
where everybody can get used to it
probably fine might even be a positive
probably a positive i would say
so every time somebody says you know
anglo-saxon or not
you know like it's binary that's just a
bad argument
and it sounds racist so go with what
makes sense
which is you want a functioning culture
so you don't become china
and with china i've heard i'm not sure
this is exactly the total explanation
but i've heard that in china the fear of
failure is so high that they can't take
good
entrepreneurial risks because they don't
want to fail
so that's a cultural advantage that the
united states has
that you can fail all day long and
especially anybody with a christian
background will say
hey everybody makes a mistake right yeah
one of the benefits the great advantages
of the christian tradition
is the whole forgiveness thing yeah
we're all sinners
you know try to do better that's really
powerful
we're all we all make mistakes try to do
better next time
nothing could be better than that that's
like the healthiest
cultural strength you could ever have
so i think that the the republicans do a
just a terrible job
a terrible job of making the argument
for
culture as an asset
they should argue it culture is an asset
it's our advantage over china it's
probably our advantage over most
countries
because also built into this tradition
that i'll call the american tradition
is a level of trust and commerce
that is the envy of the world in some
ways
you know our court systems as flawed as
they are and via the world
envy of the world our ability to make a
deal with a stranger
it's the envy of the world in the united
states you can make deals with strangers
and you can feel pretty good about it
most times
right you don't have to do for deals
with your friends just to know you're
not going to
get screwed so that culture is
uh absolutely the fundamental thing that
makes the united states a strong country
and as long as we're arguing about it
with with just dumb language like
anglo-saxon
even though it's true even though it's
accurate
even though there's nothing wrong with
being anglo-saxon
the communication and the persuasion of
that is an f
and that's just an f and it's a it's an
issue that needs an a plus
if you're even going to deal with
culture it's important
and you got to do it right but it's
treated as
but anyway it's being done wrong um
all right just looking at your you're so
pc scott
am i am i politically correct
or am i polite and
and more task oriented than the rest of
you
i would argue that i'm just task
oriented
in other words i'm in favor of whatever
works
if something doesn't work i don't care
how politically correct it is
i'm not interested so i think that's the
filter you should put on me
some things work and some things don't
one of the things that works is
politeness
treating each other with respect pretty
much always works
right so if i'm in favor of let's say
correctly you could argue with correctly
but
let's say uh use a different word if i
argue in favor of treating
transgender athletes or transgender
anybody
with the the kind of language that they
would like
and the respect that anybody would want
is that politically correct or is that
just not being a dick
i mean there's a big difference between
being politically correct
and just being polite treating people
with some respect
all right uh
yeah so there's a good dividing line i'm
seeing in the comments
somebody said that a politically correct
person would kneel
you know for the the black lives matter
stuff i wouldn't do that
in a million years there's nothing that
can make me kneel
to somebody else's political preference
that would never happen
so if you're worried that political
correctness is driving me
there's a good example that i would
never be on the side of
kneeling for somebody else's political
opinion that's just not gonna happen
um how would you deal with it
you mean the kneeling thing i would
object
but politely and respectfully
you know if you're gonna not kneel you
probably would be helpful if you had a
little bit of a body of work
or some tweets or some kind of
background that would say you're
not a racist like and shouldn't you
always have that anyway
don't you think if people people look
into your past words and actions
shouldn't they find some good stuff
there like the time you
supported martin luther king or
something
i mean that would be that'd be about the
smallest thing you could do
but there should be something in your
history
that says if you don't kneel it's not
because you're you joined the clan
you're just not buying into that
all right a wireless taser somebody says
well that's a different topic
somebody says mlk has been debunked
well well let me say this
about our heroes as far as i know
all of our heroes are fake
you knew that right that it doesn't
matter if it's you know george
washington
or martin luther king so forget about
ethnicity
nothing about ethnicity we manufacture
heroes
because the the hero embodies something
that we want to be part of our culture
so when you say mlk has been debunked it
actually doesn't mean anything
because what you're talking about is the
human and the humans irrelevant
the the actual person who was martin
luther king
you know with the you know the body of
him
and the brain of him he's completely
irrelevant
what matters now is the packaging of him
as a
an icon as a you know a symbol
of a certain set of things that you you
think you want to promote
so uh you can't debunk
that you you could say that the person
did not equal the
the icon but that's all of them none of
the people
are all good yeah there's no such thing
as a
famous person who didn't have some
issues
yeah and even even mlk would not have
claimed he was perfect uh
etc yeah and and of course that's the
tradition
the catholic trinity not catholic the
the christian
tradition is that whether or not a milky
mlk strayed in whatever ways he's being
accused of
still okay right you can still sin
and get to heaven if you if you're
turning things around
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
