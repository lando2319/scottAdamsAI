hey everybody
it's time for coffee with scott adams
the best part of the day
again
again
for four years running
and if you'd like to take it up a level
i know you do all you need is a copper
bunker glass attacker tell stein canteen
dragonflax vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dope of being hit of the day the
thing that makes everything better
except
leaving afghanistan it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens
now
oh that was good
that was well planned
just like afghanistan
well let's see what we've got going on
in the news here lots of interesting
stuff
uh
interesting interesting stuff that i
said to myself so it'd be right here in
my phone
with my email that's totally working
what the f
is going on
hold on a second
why in hell
did gmail stop working at the beginning
of my
all right there it is i really sent it
so i really said ah there it is it just
appeared
takes a long time to email yourself
sometimes
story number one
mask resistance
it's coming
mass resistance
and
it's starting in san diego county school
district so there's one
private school network
and one county school district a
district it's not just a school it's a
whole district
that are making masks optional despite
the government's requirements
that's right
and so i ask you this
what will be the penalty
for the school district and the private
school
who made masks optional
will they be executed
will they be rounded up and taken to
jail
nope
there's no penalty
can i tell you something that you didn't
realize
it's not up to the government where you
if you wear masks
it's not up to the government
it's up to you
the government doesn't have any control
of you they can't make you wear a mask
they can't now it is true that if only a
few people resist
it's not going to make much difference
but take a look at the san diego county
school district do you think the police
are going to come in and round people up
nope
i don't think so
how many more school districts would it
take before they all just say uh
there's no penalty
because guess what
there's no penalty there couldn't be now
you could imagine they might try to make
your life hard you know at least
hassle you a little bit
if there's just one or two of you
but if an entire school district decides
uh mass are optional what the hell are
you gonna do
so stop thinking that the government is
making you wear masks
that's not happening
you're wearing masks voluntarily
just just own it you're doing it
voluntarily you could easily not wear a
mask well you'd be paying the ass if you
were the only one because people would
hassle you but no it's it's a the public
is volunteering for this
that's what's happening if you think the
government is making you wear a mask
how
whether they have a gun pointed at you
is there some law i don't know about
where i'll go to jail if i wear a mask
the government is making you do anything
all right
um i've always believed that in terms of
vaccinations and passports and stuff
it's not going to be the government that
makes you do it it'll be
some combination of economics
insurance which is also economics
and brand
brand protection so companies will want
to protect their brand
so here's the perfect example
apparently the las vegas raiders are
going to require fans to provide proof
of vaccination to go to home games
the lawsuit the las vegas raiders let me
take those two things individually
las vegas
where everything's legal and free and
the government doesn't bother you
las vegas
is going to make you i mean something in
las vegas is going to make you wear a
get get vaccinated
secondly
the raiders
the raiders are you kidding me their
entire brand
is about being you know pirates and
rebels and you know
take your risks and all that stuff
and they're going to make you get a
vaccination too
so
it seemed inevitable that the economics
and the insurance of it and the brand
management would require
companies to be the enforcers so you
don't really need the government to tell
you to do anything these are private
companies making private well
they're public companies in some cases
but making uh
making
decisions about what's good for their
brand
is that a problem
you like capitalism right
big government's bad capitalism is good
so capitalism is going to
drive the passports i think
as far as they go i don't know how far
they'll go
so chris cuomo
with impeccable timing and i don't know
if this is a coincidence or not
managed to make his first public
statement about the resignation of his
brother governor cuomo
and he waited until the biggest news day
of the year
well i suppose january 6 was the biggest
news day
but the biggest news day of the summer
wouldn't you say the afghan withdrawal
it's very visual it's horrible we all
want to talk about it so he picked just
the best time to do it
really he nailed that now it could be it
was just the end of his vacation anyway
so it might have been just just
accidental but man talk about a lucky
accident for him
took him right off the headlines
well here's a
question i saw from uh
raul davis as the ceo branding expert
and i'll reword it so it's not his exact
words but here's the thing we know that
there was don't we know this because it
was in the news
and if it's if it's in the news it's
true
do we all agree with that right
that
if it's in the news it's true
right yeah i think we do
so the news told us that on january 6
there was this insurrection
violent insurrection in the capital and
that
many people had been rounded up
as being party to that insurrection
but here's the troubling part
biden's department of justice is
refusing to charge anybody with
insurrection
they're only charging with like smaller
stuff like obstructing a public meeting
or you know interfering with the
government
something like that
so why isn't the department of justice
going hard at these insurrectionists
why is nobody being charged with
insurrection
i
as raul davis points out
shouldn't we be investigating
the department of justice
because the department of justice is
apparently
refusing to do the obvious thing that
you should do
which is press charges against
insurrectionists
i can't think of anything worse
than an insurrection
so let's put some pressure on the
department of justice to do their job
do their job
let's see some charges for all this
insurrection
wait wait what
what are you telling me that
no no justice department anywhere
has found any evidence of an
insurrection sufficient to charge
somebody with
what
what
how could that be with all the video
and
and and all the witnesses
and all the insurrection
what what
so
there's that
here's a good question
um
why did we lose in afghanistan
what the hell happened there
now
uh one theory and i don't know how much
weight to put on this so i'll just put
this out there and like let you
wrestle with a little bit
uh
reportedly
the u.s did not want to destroy the oh
the poppy fields where all the opiates
came from
because for rural afghanistan that's the
only way they made money
so if you mowed down the poppy fields
then a whole bunch of people would
starve to death i guess so that we
couldn't do that
but
wasn't it those same poppy feels that
funded the taliban
or who else funded them was there
somebody else was it
some other country funding the taliban
because
at the very least they were well funded
weren't they
because they had you know money and
resources to take over a country in a
week that's pretty well funded
somebody said somebody says the cia
funded the taliban i don't think so
at least not recently
but
so the question is this what should we
have done
should we have just mowed those poppy
fields because they couldn't have been
that hard to find you know mowed them
with fire of course
um
and just taking care of the you know
resulting economic displacement
because you could probably still feed
the people somehow and i don't know
convert them to some other kind of
agriculture maybe in the long run
but apparently nothing works in
afghanistan you can't convert any
industries you can't create any
industries you can't get the government
to do anything you can't get the army to
work
there's something going on over there
that makes everything not work
but i think the opiate field
part of that might be a
big portion of it um
biden according to rasmussen polls biden
reached a record low approval 45 percent
no surprise if you
have i told you that uh
that visual persuasion and scary stuff
is really effective it's like the most
effective persuasion i i'm sure that
this poll was taken before the images of
the afghans trying to flee their country
and falling from the airplane as it took
off
this this low approval rating was
probably before that i'm guessing
because of the timing
what's it going to be after
i don't think it'll be 45 percent but
maybe who knows
um
apparently there are 30 000 afghans that
we want to relocate that must be
interpreters and helpers and the
families that's a lot of people
30 000 people
but
if you're worried about thirty thousand
uh refugees coming in
these are probably the ones you want
um
now economically who knows how much they
can support themselves when they get
here but they would be 30 000 people who
were working with us and on our side
and sort of you know they're leading our
direction to begin with
so
uh if we could help these people i think
they would be loyal americans
i think that
they would be
um i would be proud to have them in this
country if they fought with us in
afghanistan
and sure you know there might be some
trouble might be expensive but i would
be proud to have them
apparently the taliban is offering a
general amnesty for government workers
so they can go back to work without risk
of being killed
would you trust the taliban
if the taliban said i've got to deal
with you
we've got a deal
we won't
brutally murder you
just go back to work and we'll pretend
we'll pretend you never were on the
other side
is that going to
work maybe
it might
i have to think that one of the the
strongest things the taliban had going
for them
is their unprecedented level of
brutality
would you agree
an unprecedented level of brutality i
feel like that's
i feel like that's why they conquered
the country in a week
because i think the afghan government
and the afghan army said you know
we might be able to beat them in a fight
we might
but if we lose
they're going to slay our family and
torture us and execute us
so losing was a really
you know bad deal
versus just saying we give up let's run
away
so i have a feeling that the brutality
of the
the taliban is what won them the war i
feel like their reputation won them the
war does anybody feel the same
i mean they
obviously had to move resources into the
places they took over
but i feel like nobody fought because
they didn't want to take a chance to
lose them
you know you could take a chance of
losing against some enemies and still
figure well
we'll do a peace deal we'll get on with
our business
but i don't know if that works with the
taliban
all right here's the
provocative part
i'm going to support biden totally in
his withdrawal
including the way you did it
all right
i'm also going to support trump
for getting the process moving
so in my opinion
both biden and trump were right 100
now here's the part you're going to say
scott's god it's god it's not about that
it's about the incompetence of leaving
and here's where i'm going to surprise
you
i don't think there was any
now
there could be because there's more that
we don't know than we do know right but
i'm going to tell you that it's not
evident
there could have been
massive incompetence certainly i mean i
wouldn't rule that out but i didn't see
it
here's what i mean what would happen no
matter who was the president
when
uh no matter who was the president as
soon as we said we're leaving what's
going to happen
the afghan government's going to start
packing his bags the entire the only way
you could leave that country peacefully
and
in some orderly way is if the afghan
government was willing to fight
and then actually fought
and that was never the case it wasn't
the case under trump it wasn't the case
under biden it wouldn't be the case
under the next president
there would be no willingness to fight
by the afghan people and without that
there was also no way to get out without
bitmap being messy
here's an assumption i'm going to make
you can check this assumption
that the american withdrawal
required to some degree
that the country wasn't falling apart at
the same time
in other words you couldn't have all of
your
defense and structure falling apart
while you're trying to get all your
assets out that would be the most
dangerous thing
you wanted it to stay coherent enough
that you could get your important
american assets out
and then let it fall apart
and that's what happened
we got our stuff out without apparently
without even telling people at bagram
air force base they were even leaving
they didn't even give them a warning
they were just gone
right
if you think that was a mistake
i would challenge your assumption
it could have been so so let me say as
clearly as i can
you could be right because i'll bet
every one of you is thinking that the
plant was pure naked incompetence and
when i look at general milly
i think well that makes sense because he
does look incompetent
i'm sorry
he must have competence to get to become
a general i think you'd have to be
competent
but he doesn't look it i mean he looks
like he's incompetent he acts like it
when he talks in public
so it wouldn't be hard to believe
that we just effed up the whole thing
but
i think we would have anyway
i think you could have changed out all
the people and gotten the same result
because the moment you say you're
leaving the whole country falls apart
the afghan government leaves
it's gonna get wet it's gonna get wet
so if you say that you know that biden
did this worse
than somebody else
forget you're forgetting your lessons
from covet
what did we learn from covet
the thing we learned from covet is the
only way you know anything
is you do have to do a randomized
controlled trial
right
and we can argue about
meta
metadata and meta studies but for my
analogy
the reason you can't always tell if a
drug worked is you didn't do a
controlled study so there's nothing to
compare it to you know it did well or
didn't do well you just don't know what
the alternative would have been
likewise all we know is what happened in
afghanistan
we don't know what trump would have done
we don't know what
a president hillary clinton would have
done we don't know what anybody else
would have done
if you if you are certain
that the result we got
was worse
than if we'd done something differently
there's no
support for that
you have an opinion with absolutely no
support
now later
later i'm saying come on man
now later we might find out that you're
totally right
we could right so hear me clearly
you could be totally right
and i could be totally wrong
but here's my only point
i'm making my opinion based on
observation
you're making your opinion based on
speculation
and it's baseless
it is baseless speculation that it would
have gone better if we'd done something
different
i don't think there was a right way out
i think we only had two bad ways out
bad slow and bad fast
and we took bad fast was that a mistake
no it wasn't
if you have a choice of bad slow or bad
fast
and they're both
just terrible
do it bad fast
get it over with
who whoever was president was going to
be president when somebody fell off a
plane
right now i'm using that as
you know a representative of something
bad was going to happen
but somebody was going to fall off a
plane
and it was going to be on film
the taliban was going to brutally kill
people
that stuff was all going to happen
so the part that the part that is the
key part
that separates your opinion from mine
is your assumption about what the afghan
government would have done right so this
is a key point the only difference in
our opinions i think
is your assumption of what the afghan
government would have done
if we'd done a more planned
phased withdrawal i say they would have
folded in every case
in every case the afghan government
would be packing their bags because they
were pretty dead
and they knew it
so
while it is a completely reasonable
assumption
completely reasonable that i'm wrong
is everybody hearing that
i want to hear it clearly
that tomorrow we might find out some
information of a specific thing we did
wrong that would completely change my
opinion i'm just saying that as of today
your opinion has no support
could be right you might be right
evidence might prove you right i
wouldn't be surprised at all
but as long as the afghan government was
going to
evaporate as soon as we started leaving
you didn't really have an option to do
it right
you only had an option to do it fast
and that's what they did
now i have to think that the people over
there had a little bit of capability
meaning that
i'm seeing lots of people saying you are
wrong
hey everybody who's saying you're wrong
i hear you
i hear you and i even think you might be
right
i'm just saying that you don't have
evidence for your opinion
that's all
david sacks did a tweet today on this
point
now if you don't know david sacks a very
successful investor one of the smartest
guys around
about everything and
he said this in a tweet the correct
order of operations would be this number
one shred sensitive documents
sounds good number two evacuate
civilians and allies
sounds perfectly reasonable number three
pull out the military and then number
four announce the end of fighting
now that
would be a good business
order of things right
as jan says there you go that's the way
to do it
this wouldn't work
have any of you ever worked in any kind
of a large organization
there's no way this would work
here's what would go wrong step one
shred sensitive documents
at this point
some of the afghans find out you're
ready to leave
everything falls apart
you can't get to step two
evacuate civilians and allies because
the entire structure of the country
would have dissolved before you got
there
there wouldn't be transportation there
wouldn't be a government entities
it would just be chaos
so could you get your military out
easily if the civilian structure support
structure was disappearing at the same
time
well not easily and not safely so it
looks like we've made a decision to
protect our military at the expense of
some of the civilians
and
unfortunately that's what we pay our
military to do right to protect us
but not necessarily other countries
it's not really their job
so i don't think that would work
what is let me put it down to the
individual person let's say you're uh
you're an afghan citizen and you've been
working with the american
presence
so you worked with the americans and you
know you're pretty much in tough shape
if the taliban take over and you didn't
get out
um
boy people are mad today
people are mad
you old fool
the old fool
the the people are disagreeing have a
much different impression of the
competence of human beings
and the competence of the afghan
government that i do
probably you could boil it down to one
difference in assumption
the people who think that biden got it
wrong
believe the afghan government was
capable of competence
am i right
because if the afghan afghan government
had been competent we could have been we
could have worked with them and done a
more phased withdrawal you know put them
in charge have them cover our backs
while we leave thanks a lot for helping
us up to this point
but the afghan government
had no competence
none
so
uh you know that's our difference of
agreement so remember if you're
disagreeing with me you're hanging your
assumption
on the afghan government's competence
that's that's what you base your opinion
on and i base it on them being
incompetent to the extreme
that's the difference
right
and like i say i could be wrong
all right um if you think that what
our problem was in afghanistan is a lack
of leadership
including the way we left
you've got a much higher opinion of
everything in afghanistan than i do
i don't feel like leadership was even a
variable
remember i told you in
when the pandemic started
one of my best predictions i think
i told you that leadership wouldn't
matter
and everybody was sure did
everybody i don't think a single
person agreed with me when i said that i
said leadership wouldn't matter you
wouldn't see it in the statistics
guess what
it's not in the statistics
you can't find it
we still don't know why some countries
do better than others we really don't
so leadership is always the thing we
look to as the the magic bullet that
made everything different we look to it
in afghanistan say you know
if we'd had better leadership
and we look at the pandemic we say you
know
the united states had better leadership
nope
nope there's no evidence that leadership
made any difference in either of these
cases
my long
goal of being a
musical uh power and a lyricist is now
accomplished
thanks to akira the dawn who takes
podcasts such as mine and i think jordan
peterson and some other folks
and and takes out samples part of what
we say in our podcast and puts it to
really interesting music
and if you think that that doesn't work
you're wrong
it works in the same way that beatles
music worked
now if you study the beatles you know
that one of part of their magic was that
their songs were nonsense
they didn't make any sense the lyrics
you know the story of the song was
nothing it was just pieces that they had
that they put together it sounded good
and once you free yourself from the
thought that your song has to make sense
which is what the beatles did
uh and akira the dawn
has
sort of in the same way made the uh the
same
same kind of artistic choice is
different in this case because he's
intentionally putting things together
that you wouldn't normally put together
but that's what the beatles did
they would take things that shouldn't be
together
but they sound good
so they just put them together
and people would think hey
you can't put together a lyric from this
idea with a lyric from this idea and
then suddenly you're an orchestra and
now you're pl you're just drums and
guitar you can't do that
but then they did and it worked great so
we care of the dawn did the same thing
in a different way you just put together
these podcast
lyrics if you can call it that
and put it to really interesting you
know beat and
music it's called uh meaning wave
so if you're looking for it uh search
for
meaning wave one word
meaning wave
and the album's coming out
on september 10th
and the first singles coming out this
week
called uh
which is got my voice on it
george soros tweeted
have you ever heard of george soros
anybody anybody
george soros tweeted i consider
president xi
the most dangerous enemy of open
societies in the world
well
now we've got a fight on our hands if
you believe that george soros was
actively destroying the united states
with his many
donations to groups that you don't like
what's he going to do to china
george soros just said china is his
biggest enemy
so
i don't know i think this is interesting
to watch if you think george soros was
so powerful that he was a threat to the
united states
would he be a threat to china
and what would he do does he have any in
there maybe maybe they don't have enough
freedom that he can take advantage of
but do you think that would stop him
i don't know that would stop him i think
you just find a different way in
so
george soros
enemy of my enemy
let's talk
because as much as you don't like george
soros and okay you have your reasons
uh i don't like china even more
so
george if you're listening
if i can give you a boost there on
taking care of china
let's talk
and let me have my enemy
so user twitter user anomaly you all
know him probably makes a lot of noise
on politics he is still taunting me
on twitter to uh debate him or
or to make a better argument for all the
times we disagree except it's the
weirdest situation
i don't
know that we disagree on anything
he he's imagining we disagree on stuff
that we don't disagree on
and he's taunting me in public to debate
him
on the things that we agree on
and i don't know how you debate
agreement
and watching other people pour in and
and come up with uh imaginary things
that we disagree with oh well he says
this and you say that and i say no i
don't
i say the opposite of that
so there's this weird gigantic imaginary
fight going on
between the imaginary me
and somebody i've never met anomaly
and and other people are getting in it's
like it's become a spectator sport
it's imaginary
and it has spectators
i'm not making that up
i'm in an imaginary battle
over imaginary topics
and there are spectators
they're spectators
what's happening
what the hell is happening
spectators to an imaginary fight
all right
so um these are just some of the things
that are happening today
and
uh as long as the uh afghan thing's
going crazy i don't think anybody
uh
i don't think anybody
has any other news to talk about
all right uh
scott is scared to debate
let me ask you this
can you even imagine a debate with me an
anomaly if you if you know i'm from
twitter some of you do
uh
somebody says prediction millie becomes
the fall guy and is fired
oh that's not a bad prediction i'm not
going to go with you on that prediction
because i don't know that he did it
wrong
i really don't
so at this point
i don't know if he can defend himself
because everybody's going to believe he
did it wrong but the evidence isn't
there
we have an evidence of the outcome we
don't have an evidence of the process
and we don't have anything to compare it
to
so so so judging things based on
outcomes is not rational
you would need to know a lot more about
the mechanics of it to know if the
outcome is really telling you something
um
scott debates too much with the block
button
well
blocking is part of the show
you know that right
uh
i don't have a cracked iphone screen i
have a cracked
phone protector somebody's blaming me
for having a cracked iphone screen
incorrect
incorrect
let me put it this way
if
everything i know about you i can find
out
from how long it takes you to put your
protector on your phone
here's what i do
i will not
hold my phone in my hand
except to put the case on it and the
protector when i first buy a new one i
won't even walk around with it in my
hand i will lay it carefully on a
surface
often handing it to the person who sold
me the phone and saying would you mind
putting that phone in that case and
while you're at it would you slap that
protector on it
now
if you heard that's the way i handled my
new phone
would you offer me a job
let's say i came in and asked for a job
and that's all you knew about me is how
i handled my phone
i would hire me i would hire me in a
heartbeat
now
compare that to the person who i shall
not name
who has a cracked real screen
and did not put a screen protector on it
would you hire somebody
who had a thousand dollar instrument
that they didn't put a screen protector
on
i wouldn't
i would not hire somebody who didn't put
a screen protector on their phone period
period i don't even need to look at your
resume you're from harvard that's great
you didn't put a screen protector under
your phone as soon as you got it
nope
you can't work for me
you can't work for me that is that's the
bottom line and you know what
if you're not the person who paid for
the phone
and you didn't put the screen protector
on
you really don't get the job i will i'll
make an exception
i do have a friend
who is rich
and he loves the way the iphone looks
with no protector
and he loves the way i think he likes it
without the screen protector or the case
now he's rich
he pays for it himself
if he drops the phone he buys another
one
he doesn't to anybody it's his own
phone i'd give him a job i'd give him a
job at a heartbeat
but
if his children
don't put a protector on it
well i'm not going to hire them
because they're not paying for the phone
if somebody's paying for it
okay do whatever you want it's your
money
but if you're too dumb to put a phone
protect or put a protector on it when
someone else is paying for your phone
that's not good thinking and you can't
have a job with me
but he's modeling that behavior to them
yes but they know who pays for it
somebody said there's a rumor i don't
believe this but it's a fun one a rumor
that steve jobs would drive around palo
alto without license plates because he
only leased his cars for six months at a
time okay i don't believe anything about
that story
but it's funny to imagine steve jobs
being pulled over
you know you're the cop and you pull
over steve jobs and you say can i have
your license and oh wait you're steve
jobs
i guess i don't need identification
um you know i have a license plate
yeah i know
well whatever
i don't know if anybody would care
i think if you met steve jobs in person
sort of accidentally because you pulled
him over at a traffic stop you would be
so
so pulled into his reality distortion
field i don't even know if you give him
a ticket
he might have done it just for fun to
see if he could talk his way out of
every ticket because i'll bet he could
i'll bet i'll bet jobs could talk
himself at any ticket
um oh thank you somebody said they
thought this show was good i don't know
if it was but thank you
he could beat everything except cancer
yeah
um
uh rapid rapid home tests yes
um i i saw a link on some rapid tests
but the the question is always
availability
um i know some exist
it's always good when scott isn't talk
well i did talk about mass but i talked
about mass resistance
so that made you happy
um oh your business partner just got
tests from amazon so does amazon have
rapid tests is that what you're telling
me because that would be a big deal
so new zealand just shut down the whole
country because they had one one
positive case that just happened
yeah so do you think new zealand's
handling it right shut down the whole
country one case
how do they keep the rest of the cases
from coming in
i don't know what their vaccination
situation is but
i've got a feeling that the covenant is
all over the place there maybe they just
don't know it all right
i am going to go do something else
and
i will talk to you
later
