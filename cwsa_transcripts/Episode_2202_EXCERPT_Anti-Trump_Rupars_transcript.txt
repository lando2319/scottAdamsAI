do you remember how many times you've
seen
um
uh
uh that we need to find eleven thousand
seven hundred eighty votes you've seen
that in the headlines you've seen it
from pundits you've seen it on the news
right so that's all true
because it's on the news it's quoted and
you've probably even seen or you've
probably even heard audio of him saying
it have you not
well I found out today that this was
always a rhubarb and I didn't know it
now if you're new to me a rhubarb
r-u-p-a-r refers to a video but it could
apply to audio as well in which you
delete part of it and here's the weird
characteristic of a rupar deleting part
of it
reverses its meaning reverses it it
doesn't just take a Nuance away it
actually reverses it right so for
example uh some rupars were the fine
people hoax if you take away the part
where he says immediately after he said
find people he said I'm not talking
about the neo-nazis they should be
condemned completely if you remove that
which they did it reverses the meaning
from disavowing Nazis which he said
explicitly
to complementing them and supporting
Nazis it's a complete reversal by
removing one part
likewise with the drinking bleach Oaks
when they remove the part before he
talks about it and immediately after
those are the two clarifications
the clarifications were that he was
talking about light being brought into
the lungs you know literally putting a
stent down there or something in shining
light on the lungs as a possible
disinfectant
the news removes the reference of light
on both ends and he made sure he put it
on both ends so you wouldn't be confused
so they removed it and reported it and
that changed it to he wants you to drink
bleach
now drinking bleach is not even similar
in any way to Shining Light down your
down your uh
down your lungs
now I'm watching some some people who
are finding this out for the first time
imagine you're watching this live stream
right now and you're hearing this for
the first time
and I just saw somebody go LOL
sorry
that this is really mind-bending if you
haven't heard it before here's another
one the uh over feeding the koi the the
fish in Japan
so the real video showed uh he was with
uh I guess it was uh president Abe
and uh or one of the presidents I forget
who it was I think it was Abe right and
the two of them were feeding koi fish by
throwing some you know bread or whatever
in and then when they were done Abe led
by dumping the rest of his fish food in
because he was done and then Trump also
dumped his in because he was Following
the Leader literally
when you cut out the part where Abe went
first the news showed that Trump was a
big old dope instead of feeding the fish
like a little at a time he just dumped
his fish food
that's a that's a rupar
um
you remember the Covington kids video
you it looked like the teenager was
getting in the face of some Native
American oh my God that kid fooled me
fooled me for 24 hours
but it's because they clipped out the
part where it was the Native American
guy who was actually getting in the face
of the kid it looked opposite if you
take that out so the rupar remember that
the rupar doesn't just change like a
detail
it complete it completely changes the
story to an opposite or something that's
horrible horrible in the opposite
direction
right so in the drinking bleach hoax
Trump was actually ahead of the
scientists because he was aware of a
trial that was actually being trialled
at that time to see if light would work
as a disinfectant in the trachea in the
lungs
so he knew something above the
scientists
and the News reversed it to not only did
he know more about you know that one
little thing but that he was so dumb he
thinks you should drink bleach
now half of the country actually
believed all of those things and still
does half of the country believes all of
those things because a rupar video is
really persuasive
it's really persuasive
so it turns out that this uh find the
five eleven thousand seven hundred
eighty votes was it just another rupar
and I didn't find that out until
today
today is the day I found that out
can you believe it now I'll explain it
to you because you you might not be
aware of it I know for example Breitbart
did report this when it happened but I
think we lost you know if you ever knew
it you probably forgot it by now I did
um
here's his actual full statement so this
is on audio
we know this is his full statement
so look all I want to do is this I just
want to find 11 780 votes which is more
than we have because we won the state
which part did they take out
because we won the state
if you take out because we won the state
which is a very clear statement that he
believes that they're trying to take an
illegitimate result
look at it more closely
and come up with a legitimate vote
because he thinks he won
what part did they leave out every
 time
because we won the state what is the
entire the entire trial is about his
State of Mind did he really believe he
won the state
or not now this alone would not be
evidence of his state of mind because
they could just say he was lying but it
is evidence
not not conclusive but it's more
evidence of of uh scope I would say this
is exculpatory
exculpatory am I using that word right
it's evidence that we should be given
the public and certainly the court but
we should be given this evidence from
the beginning because this is the part
that gives you context to explain what
he's saying imagine you heard only this
I just want you to find 11 780 votes
does that sound like Mafia talk
yeah a little bit a little bit doesn't
it it sounds a little bit like Mafi talk
it's not guaranteed it's Mafia talk but
you could easily imagine it right you
can imagine it now you add because we
won the state is that what the mafia guy
says does the mafia guy does the mafia
boss say I'd like you to go get that
thing that we legally own
hey uh I'd like you to go to the store
and get me some products
all right I'm gonna steal some products
for you no no no here's the money
take the money
go to the store
pay for the products bring them to me
and the change to yes the change too
go to the store pay for the products
put them in a bag get a receipt bring it
to me
that's what they're accusing you of
they're accusing him of asking for
something he is specifically calling out
as legal
that's the mafia talk
he might go to jail because of a rupar
audio
which basically is biased the entire
world so that by the time you reach the
jury pool you're so polluted that it
wouldn't matter what you heard at that
point
yeah it goes to his intention and his
intention is completely different
if he says I think I won
can you find the evidence of that by
looking more carefully
completely different
