let's watch something amazing while
we're waiting for people to stream
in go well there it
comes
wow well let's see if
light here's a Starship returning back
and the it's going to be grabbed by the
launcher two big arms it's going to grab
it when
itly holy holy think that's
holy watch this people watch this
godamn no freaking
way
no
freaking way I can't believe that work
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
freaking my
god oh my god well there it
comes wow wow one more time let's see
one more
time oh
yes go how in the world does this
work holy holy come on baby
holy
 God
damn no freaking
way
no
freaking way
how is that possible freaking way how is
that
possible
wow
wow wow indeed that is quite the
accomplishment
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
obviously if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
understand with their tiny shiny human
brains all you need for that is a CER
mugger a glass a tanker chin a canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind
including the
Starship and now join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine H
the day thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous
Sip and it happens now
go
oh my
[Music]
goodness that was my impression of a
Starship quite
amazing if if you had to guess would you
guess that you could ever make a
gigantic ship like the biggest rocket
ever and then just sort of catch it with
two chopsticks and a
gigantic rocket grabbing
machine how in the world did he pull
that off so how was your week Elon Musk
had a good week you rolled out rooc cabs
um let's see see auto auto
taxis um what else let's see there was a
robo
van uh there was a fleet of robots s
although they were human
operated uh and now the
Starship oh my
goodness oh my goodness what a
week and there's a good possibility that
within a month his preferred candidate
for president will be president we'll
talk about that meanwhile according to
the Daily Mail evidence of alien life
could be revealed next month says a NASA
filmmaker well if there's one person you
can believe about space and science it's
a filmmaker yeah a filmmaker so we've
got this really important Source a
filmmaker but he does know some real
things apparently there is a real 5our
Long Radio burst that comes from a a
region well I know this region well it's
called Proxima
centu I I like the vacation there it's
4.2 light years away from Earth so the
trip is it's a long trip but it's worth
it you should see the beaches oh my God
they're great the food oh the food on
proxim
centory it's out of this
world anyway uh they think that maybe
according to the Oxford team they're
analyzing it and they're they're putting
it through the machines and the analysis
and they're going to find out what the
heck is this because it seems to be that
it could be a nonhuman
intelligence from our solar system no
not from our
universe very exciting or the other
thing it could be do you know what the
other thing it could
be um nothing nothing it could be just
some random noise so it's either we've
discovered intelligent life somewhere
out in the universe capable of sending a
radio signal that we can interpret
4.2 light years away from Earth or it's
noise just random noise they can't tell
yet but it's definitely one of those two
things I'm going to bet on random
noise you want to place your bets yeah
I'm going to bet on
noise oh there's always that one person
who can't
hear you always you know you never know
if it's the troll is it always the same
person I can't hear everybody else is
commenting like they can hear but I
can't hear you know what I should do I
should stop thousands of people from
having fun in the normal way that they'd
like to so that I can yell hey I okay
here thank you
Paul anyway there's another study from
let's see who had this somebody that uh
oh from no Ridge whatever that is no
Ridge that muscle strength is linked to
better mental health the stronger you
are the smarter you are now finally you
understand why I'm so smart it's my
muscles yeah yeah how many times have I
told you a million times just this week
that your brain and your body are the
same Organ Stop saying there's a brain
and there's a body and there are
different things no your body is your
brain you take care of your body and
you're smarter what does that mean your
body's your brain
it the the moment you realize that that
reframe is true it's not just something
you say your body is your brain take
care of your body if you want your brain
to work and you want to have good mental
health and all that stuff get that body
going speaking your body according to
slay news 60% of baby food sold in
America doesn't meet nutritional
standards yikes most of it didn't meet
protein guidelines 44% had more sugar
than it should have and 25 didn't even
meet the calorie
requirement
so we don't check the quality of the
food we give to
toddlers apparently not are you
surprised no you're not it's exactly
what you'd expect if I told you hey
we've never done this before but I'd
like you to study the quality of the
food that we served to
toddlers do you think you would have had
to study
it well you could have just asked me
Scott do you think that the food that
we're giving to toddlers is as safe as
we'd like it to be huh let me just think
for a moment uh 100% of everything else
in the country is up beyond
belief but no not the toddler food the
toddler food's fine no I wouldn't have
said that would have said everything in
the country is up beyond belief
except for apparently SpaceX and things
that Elon does and everything else is
 up beyond belief oh but no the
the food for the toddlers is the one
bright spot among it all no it isn't
it's exactly like everything else in the
country it's a fraud in all likelihood
everything from our elections to our
health care to our food for our toddlers
to our finance system it does appear
that it's all
broken
so there's that there's a new uh
potential big Discovery Tech Explorer is
talking about it that uh some company
came up with some something called an
integer integer Edition algorithm that
can reduce the electricity needed for AI
by 95% thank you
95% what is one of the biggest problems
in the country right now that we're
going to run out of
electricity because of all the AI
requirements it's just
massively um hungry for electricity more
than way more than we have you like 10
times more than the country produces we
would need for AI and we don't really
have a a way to get there fast enough
but with a small change in
Hardware which has already been
prototyped so they they built it they've
tested it in Hardware they can reduce
the AI electricity need by
95% now the Nvidia chips don't have this
so for the Nvidia product to go down
that much in power need they would have
to add some some kind of Hardware fix
but it seems doable if this checks out
so we don't know exactly yet if the
claim checks out but if it
did big big big big big news for the
country the world
really well there's a little known
psychedelic that I never heard of uh
that they gave to some rats it's a it's
got a big scientific name that I never
heard of you've never heard of it either
and it's not one of the common ones that
people talk about it's some new
thing uh it's a it's a five D methoxy 4
ioda fetene
and apparently it causes long lasting
changes to brain structure and cognitive
ability in mice I said rats but should
have said
mice and uh it can make your mouse
smarter and more flexible in the long
run and stays that way you wonder what
is the uh What's the total
potential for modifying your brain
permanently with the
psychedelics and why is it only the
psychedelics who seem to do it
have you noticed that if you give your
brain something that's not as
psychedelic it might make it you know a
little faster or something but it
doesn't make these radical
changes why is it that there's a whole
constellation it's not even just one
kind of psychedelic they're like several
psychedelics that are let's just say
indicated for improving your brain why
are they all
psychedelics there's something in the
mechanism that we don't entirely
understand and I don't know how the fact
that they're all different and they
operate in different ways and yet they
would all be like amazingly positive for
your brain and your mental
health I would like to suggest the
following that what these psychedelics
do is less about the exact chemical
composition and more about what it
allows your awareness to accept
and once your awareness accepts that you
perhaps have some control over your how
you feel and how you process your world
and that your world is subjective not
objective there might be some objective
truth to the external world but it's not
available to us so once you realize that
the stuff you see is a production of
your own brain which is what
psychedelics teach you and you never
lose that once you experience these
psychedelic world you realize hey I know
what everything is like I know this is a
piece of paper I can read
it everything works but it's completely
different how's that possible how can it
be completely different and it still
works and I even understand all the
parts that's when you realize that your
understanding the world is completely
subjective there might be an objective
world but you don't have access to it
you've just built this little movie in
your head I believe and this is just a
hypothesis that once you've experien the
experien the extreme subjectivity of
your
experience that you can modify it on
demand and that you can feel that you
can and that that feeling alone would be
good for your mental health and good for
your overall brain health because then
you become the the the maintainer of the
health of your brain because you realize
that you can it just moves it from
something out of your control to
seemingly something within your control
now you might say to be Scott that's all
very well and good and all happens
within your head and if you're having a
good experience of whatever is happening
inside your skull there that's great for
you but do you want to get weirder would
you like to take it up one level of
weirder for
Sunday yes Scott yes give it to us weird
give it to us hard and weird we will
here it comes hard and weird there's a
double slit
experiment which uh is being used in a
different way than the usual classic
physics double slit experiment where
they send light through two slits and
depending on whether it's being observed
or measured it can give you a different
result than if nobody's observing or
measuring it which is
suggested that perhaps the observation
is what makes reality collapse now there
are some people who say that's all Bs
and that's just our human way of
interpreting it and nothing like that's
happening at all so it's not as clear as
that but there's a new study they used a
double slit experiment just because it's
randomized so in this case they used it
as a a randomizer not as the
typical double slit thing and here's
what they did they had some
people um put their attention on it
and then and just think about it so the
people were not in in physical or visual
contact with it so they weren't touching
it and they weren't seeing it they were
just thinking about it really hard they
were just directing their intelligence
toward it another group of people were
not thinking about it not directing
their intelligence toward
it guess
what you get different results in the
double slit experiment if people are
thinking about it not even observing it
not even observing it thinking about
it now is that true I don't know it's in
the news and it's a recreational uh
belief for me it's fun so let's put it
all
together in the Psychedelic State you
have the very clear understanding that
you're building your world on your own
in your
mind but then when you're done with the
trip you might say to yourself well I'm
not actually building a real world in my
mind it's just in my
mind and then you find out that the
double slid experiment apparently in two
different ways one the classic way that
measuring makes a difference but in this
less classic way the simply thinking
about it changes the randomized
results that would clearly suggest that
you are the author of your experience in
a more fundamental way than just an
illusion of
it and so I submit to you that the
psychedelics May simply be a key that
unlocks your knowledge of how much
control you have over your actual
experience and I will suggest further
that if you were to look at the some of
the most successful
entrepreneurs you would find a very
strong
correlation between the most successful
people and having at least one
psychedelic
experience that's what the news doesn't
want you to know now am I guessing not
exactly I'm not exactly
guessing no uh you know there there are
things that are not in the news that
individuals will tell you and and I live
in Silicon Valley is you know I'm
outside of a little bit but not too far
I can tell you that some some of the
most successful people in the world have
had at least one trip now sometimes
they'll tell you what was the difference
other times they won't and and maybe it
isn't and maybe they don't know I don't
know but this is getting really
close to understanding how things
work now if there were people who could
uh move reality like that wouldn't we
see them if if somebody could actually
got really good at just manipulating
reality itself and then sharing it with
us wouldn't we be able to identify those
people you'd be able to spot them
wouldn't
you
yeah one would be called Donald
Trump who learned the power of positive
thinking um at from his pastor at church
the most famous author on the power of
positive thinking was his Pastor
coincidentally
Trump tells you often and clearly that
he uses his positivity to Simply make
the world turn into what he wanted it to
be and we watch him do it all his
life then suddenly there's a prominent
person who notices hey there's this guy
over here who's making sense and seems
to be able to control reality
itself wouldn't it be nice if I teamed
up with him that second person is called
Elon Musk who clearly
clearly understands how to change his
reality more than anybody I've ever seen
he he's changing his reality and yours
right in front of you there's another
person who's been Pro Trump who's had
psychedelic experiences recognizes one
when he sees it and also believes he can
change reality fundamentally not just
for himself but for you as well
that would be
me there's another person I can think of
who has talked publicly about um
experiences with hallucinogens the
positive experience and somebody that
you've watched with your own eyes who
started with no power in the world at
all didn't inherit
anything and still is moving reality
while you
watch his name is Mike cernovich
now I can keep naming names but not
everybody is public not everybody is
said yes I tried this I had this
experience it's not a it's not an
accident
people these are not
coincidences well you're watching people
who have gone someplace you haven't gone
including me and when we came back we
weren't the
same and we knew it and we told you we
didn't come back the same and somehow it
has been revealed to us that we have
some control over the environment that
is unusual Steve Jobs do you think Steve
Jobs had any psychedelic
experiences
yeah have you heard of a musical group
they're called uh The Beatles The
Beatles have you ever taken time to
listen to their music before they had
psychedelic experiences I want to hold
your head I Want to Hold Your Head
I want to hold your hand and have I
mentioned your hand because I Want to
Hold Your Hand your hand give me your
hand
hand and then they did psyched
psychedelics and then what happened and
then their music was so amazing they
couldn't even produce it on stage
because it required you know unusual
machines and distorting things and using
microphones uh you microphon things
differently and throwing everything in
it that works they came up with an idea
for music which is if it sounds good put
it in the song well this doesn't go with
that yes it does just put it together if
you look at the level of invention just
invention that came out of the Beatles
after
psychedelics that's the real story the
real story is the invention they they
they reached a point where there was
nothing that they wouldn't do or
couldn't do and they knew it
that was
amazing so we may be on the cusp of
understanding something at such a deep
level that you can't even believe it yet
but it's
coming well one of the things I've told
you about having a background in
economics and a background in Persuasion
as I have both both of those uh fields
are predictive fields in economic you're
predicting what happens next in
Persuasion you're predicting if I do
this I'll get this
effect and it allows you to sort of see
around corners and you kind kind of
sniff things out before you know the
details and one of the things that I've
been a little bit obsessed by just
mentally you know nothing I've talked
about is how do you move to how do you
move to
Florida like how does that even work now
I understand how to move like you hire
moving company you can get a plane
ticket and meet your stuff there I get
that part I get the physical
part but I I keep watching Florida being
devastated by hurricanes and I say to
myself how can you afford
insurance if if your odds of being taken
out are now pretty high at least let's
say in any 20 or 30 year period your
odds of completely losing a house or
major damage or
really
high and so my economics background and
my persuasion background say how can
that work like it it feels to me like
there wouldn't be enough money in the
world that would allow in Florida to be
insured they just you wouldn't be able
to buy
insurance and I was listening to the
all-in Pod and uh freeberg was
explaining exactly that that it's really
hard almost impossible to get affordable
Insurance because Florida has apparently
this is his view gone from maybe your
house will get destroyed by Hurricane
every 100 or 500 years so that's a good
bet you can get some insurance but if
the insurance company thinks that
wherever your house is your big
expensive $2 million $3 million house is
where it's going to almost certainly
disappear within 20 years they can't
make
money unless they're unless
uh charging you like 5% of your house
per year which nobody would ever
pay so it is exactly what it smelled
like so I I could smell this for a long
time I was like huh you know because I'm
always thinking about if California is a
hell hole work and I go and Florida's
always you know the top two one of the
things people mention and I think if I
went there I would have an uninsured
house I don't know how or or if I went
there when I could get insurance the
moment the insurance business completely
collapses which I think is any day now
um my house will be worth half as much
because if somebody bought it they knew
they couldn't Ure it so how much would
you pay for a house that you couldn't
Ure and it's not going to last 20 years
well not
much yeah if I said my house is $2
million but you knew it almost certainly
would just disappear in within 20 years
and it could be next year it could be 6
months from now it might just
disappear what would you pay for it a $2
million home I'll tell you what I'd pay
for
that
$100,000 what would you pay for it if
you knew it would disappear within 20
years and it could be it could be in one
year you don't know when what would you
pay for that it's like
$100,000 if you were actually rational
so I don't know how Florida recovers
from this actually I it it could be that
every place is going to look almost as
bad so there's no place to go so you
have to figure it out somehow but I
don't even think the state has enough
money to back stop the insurance
business in this case now uh California
has a similar
problem but
uh I could smell this one from long ways
away and here we are so the the odor was
actually accurate that there wasn't a
way around it I don't know what we're
going to do but probably figure it out
somehow speaking of California the
California Coastal commission they just
voted 64 to reject spacex's proposal to
uh increase the number of Falcon 9
launches from 36 to 50 at vandenbberg
uh the space force base and uh here's
part of the reason that the California
Coastal commission rejected the
application to simply do more of what
they're doing now that's working out
great remember this is not a radical
request it was a request to do more of
what they're already doing that hasn't
been a problem and it's working out
great for everybody here's part of the
reason it was turned down because of
musk's political
activities that's
right some of the people who turned it
down said it was because musk was too
involved in politics in a way that they
didn't like
that's the state I live in I actually
live in a state that turned down the
greatest entrepreneur of our time from
expanding business in my state not for a
business
reason not for an environmental
reason it's because they're
idiots and they're they're just small
idiots they should just say well we had
something that was going to sound like a
reason but H honestly our brains are not
very big and when we see people being
successful we don't like
it I'm seeing in the uh comments that
the villages you know the villages
that's a gigantic development in Florida
they were built uh above the 100-year
flood plane and they're supposed to
withstand the Hurricanes so you can you
can build structures that will survive
it is
doable so maybe everybody will just move
off the beach or something
anyway that's stupid and terrible and uh
my my state should be
embarrassed I mean it is getting a
little embarrassing to be a Californian
I don't get embarrassed by anything but
if I could be embarrassed it's all
there all right here's a fun story I
think I saw Jason Whitlock talking about
this um
there's now I'm going to put uh low
credibility in this story this is just
recre ational belief right so I'm going
to tell you an
allegation um but I don't really think
it I wouldn't take it too seriously so
it turns out that uh if you look at a
picture of one of Obama's daughters so
he's got two daughters one of his
daughter looks exactly like the chairman
of the Obama
Foundation now it so it looks like more
like somebody else's daughter but you
know that's not fair because if you've
you've seen a million stories where
somebody alleges that some child looks
like somebody else and then you find out
it really
isn't um however uh Obama has a second
daughter who coincidentally looks
exactly like that um that Obama
Foundation Chairman's
wife H and she apparently
delivered the daughter so she must be a
medical person
I think they're both medical oh I think
they're both doctors so the accusation
is that uh
coincident there are two people who are
not Obama and not Michelle who have
produced who who may be very very close
with the
family and uh maybe the actual
biological
parents now it seems to
me that you know some somebody would
know for sure and by now we'd know if
that were true so I'm going to say uh
I'm going to say no on that one so I'm
going to say no on life on other planets
I'm going to say no on any weird thing
with Obama's
kids
um so that that's my take now
recreationally if you wanted to be
believe it recreationally like oh that's
fun ah you know make your own make your
own
decisions as a public figure I don't I
don't think I would say that but you're
not public figures most of you so if
you're not a public figure go ahead
enjoy yourself over dinner have a drink
talk to your friends laugh about it
recreational belief but no as a public
figure I don't have any information that
would suggest that that's
true just
fun meanwhile uh there's Democrat
representative Jasmine Crockett she
she's making a lot of she gets a lot of
attention because she's so batshit crazy
so she says you should fear white
conservatives not migrant gangs she's
saying that again yes I fear those white
conservatives because look at all the
things they did like um well there was a
time they
uh well you know you know the time and
and then the white conservatives they
got uh but then they did this things
they did the things the uh the things I
can't remember but I'm sure they did
some bad bad things too so that's the
real problem is those people that I
can't think of anything but I'm sure
they did oh my God they're dangerous you
just listen to Jasmine
Crockett well here's a little warning
for you Russia has uh increased its
drone
production so that's no surprise right
you know you Ukraine and Russia more
increasingly getting into a drone kind
of a war so so I'm I'm just trying to
minimize this story like it's it's no
big deal it's nothing to worry about you
completely understand that we're it's a
modern world and so there'll be more
drones that's really all you need to
know about it right that's all you need
to know about Russia making more drones
oh wait their increase in production is
tenfold and they'll have 1.4 million
drones uh by the end of the
year wait 1.4
million 1.4
million if you send one drone after
every Ukrainian Soldier you would have
way more drones than
soldiers right like way
more um how do you beat Russia with 1.4
million drones
well unless Ukraine has
3.4 million which they might I mean we
don't know how many Ukraine will have
access to you know given all the various
places that could be produced and sent
to
them I don't know that the United States
is making a whole bunch of drones so I
don't think we're shipping them to
Ukraine is anybody else because we don't
have manufacturing I thought I thought
Russia didn't have a lot of
manufacturing but
oh that's
right who is really good at making
drones and is good friends with
Russia good at making drones has a major
manufacturing facility
situation oh China so you were you
worried that Russia was being driven
into the you know higher friendship with
China I remember thinking ah well it's
not like they're going to form a
military you know some kind of
military
group well I don't believe that Russia
has the ability to make 1.4 million
drones unless China is really involved
at least in the Raw Parts they might be
assembling them they might be assembling
them in Russia but I've got a feeling
that they're coming from China I don't
know but it seems to make sense cuz
China could do this volume Russia
probably
couldn't speaking of
drones
so I this this story is just blowing my
head
off so as best I can explain it it goes
like this so Langley Air Force Base
that's on the Virginia's Shoreline you
know big military facility Langley has
been getting visited by swarms of Dron
swarms not just
once
regularly coordinated swon and I'm not
talking about hobby siiz drones I'm
talking about military siiz
drones multiples of them operating in a
coordinated
fashion having full access to our
complete skies above our military
facilities
our generals go out in the roof and look
at them and say who the hell is this and
we don't know so we don't know where
they're coming from we don't know what
their intention is and we can't stop
them apparently there's some law that
says that we can't shoot down drones in
the United States so they're looking to
maybe change it so they can at least
knock one down and try to figure out if
it's a danger and you know whether or
not we should be shooting them all down
but just just hold this in your mind
Russia is making 1.4 million drones by
the end of this
year
um and there's a drone I I don't know
the number but I think it's like some
days it's at least a dozen or so so it's
it's a serious thing it's not a hobbyist
that this is not several people who
thought it'd be funny to you know Park
their cars near Langley and send their
hobby drones over there a few no
whatever this is is fully
military by its
complexity so we have a military
force that has complete control of one
of our Air Force
bases because if they can do this they
just have to send more of them and they
could take out every every asset on the
base what what would happen if a million
drones suddenly took to the air over
langly there would be nothing left do
you think somebody could put a million
drones into one facility that's on the
shoreline I do I do because you know
what's next to a shoreline a giant
ocean all you'd have to do is bring one
tanker in that looked like it was
delivering some some packages had a
bunch of tanker has a bunch of uh you
know stuff on the surface all of a
sudden the tops open up and a million
drones come out of the gigantic
tanker and they go I don't know 20 miles
can can a can a military drone go 20 mil
I think
so so could you unleash 100,000 drones
from a ship that's just offshore from
our military bases I think
so I think you
could do you think that they're doing
that now do you think that the most
likely destination and source for where
this these little swarms are coming from
is more likely the
Ocean than you know meaning ship than uh
than
land I don't
know so I've got a feeling we're being
probed but I also have a feeling that it
might be a warning
shot in other words if it's
Iran uh let me let me put it another way
I don't think Russia would do this I
don't think Russia would be this
provocative this is way over the line if
this is Russia this is way over the line
and this is not Putin's style so we
haven't seen Putin do for example
terrorist attacks in the United States
right that way over the line it's just
it's not really a style and people do
kind of stick to a style how about North
Korea do you think North Korea is doing
this no no they probably don't have the
capability but why would they like what
would why would they even do it how
about China China has the
capability
absolutely uh and they sent a uh the big
weather balloon that was really a spy
balloon so you say well if they sent the
Spy
balloon wouldn't they spend wouldn't
they send some drones just to see what's
going on to which I say I don't think so
because it's a whole different level of
provocation you know the the Spy balloon
they can just say whoops spy balloon
went off course didn't mean it but if
you're sending continual swarms of
drones over a military
asset you can't explain that away you
can't say we were just we were just
flying by and we got
lost so it's possible that China could
be behind
it but it feels a little too provocative
for
China so who would potentially have the
capability in the Drone sense but also
have the
let's say the interest and the and the
risk reward situation where they would
do it my answer is
Iran if if Iran wanted to make sure that
the United States was attackable but
more importantly want to make sure we
knew it in advance so that we don't
attack them they might do this but they
might want to keep just enough
deniability that we don't use as an
excuse to attack so if they could find
this narrow band of uhoh if that's the
Iranians we're going to lose tremendous
amounts of assets if we if we go hard at
Iran basically just a warning you know
we have complete control of the air over
anything we want in your country right
maybe um so if I had to
guess I'd say Iran would be at the top
of my
list because they have the right risk
reward you know they're they're in a
high-risk situation they would do
something
riskier uh but they wouldn't necessarily
pull the trigger they they would provoke
harder as as they do and they would want
to make sure that we knew that there was
going to be a push back that would be
intense I mean we would lose our
electrical grid we could I mean the if
you can put a swarm of of drones
anywhere you want and these are big ones
remember these are not small these these
are serious payload kind of
drones they could take out anything they
want in the United States they could
take out down or grid so as I've advised
um I would suggest that if you have the
ability to organize or find any kind of
you know secondary source of electricity
have a backup plan if you lose power I
think the odds of the United States
losing power to a military or terrorist
attack in the next 12 months
is
um at least
20% now we wouldn't lose it everywhere
at the same place it would be it would
be localized but it could be localized
to an entire State I mean it could be
localized really big so I would
plan for a
survival um plan for if you lose power
now where I live I intentionally chose
the place I live because I could survive
the weather in most situations without
power right I mean it would take me some
blankets to survive the cold and I'd
have to you know fan myself in the
summer and stay in the shade but I
wouldn't die I wouldn't die if you're in
a place where if you lost your
electricity for three months you'd
die um you should maybe at least have a
backup plan to visit a relative in a
warmer place you know someplace that's
survivable just by its nature so do a
little bit more
planning I would ask all of you to make
sure you have some food that's going to
last a while make sure you have some
water filters or or lots of excess water
but also make sure you've coordinated
with other people so that if you can
help them or they can help you in an
emergency so I would get I would get
planning the odds of losing
electricity pretty good pretty good and
I've never said that before by the way
this is the first time I that I think
this is a serious
risk so and those drones are mostly
what's scaring me uh the Trump campaign
has requested military aircraft and
bulletproof glass amid the security
threats huh why would Trump need more
bulletproof
glass you know he already has
bulletproof glass but why does he need
more and why would they need military
aircraft
drones to me it looks like the Trump
campaign has heard that the Iran has
designs to get them back and would use
the same similar tool to the kind of
tool that took solomane out Soloman was
taken out by a
drone or was it a drone or a missile or
some was it a roadside automated robot
attack I can't remember but it would
seem similar if they used highte to take
out an American leader if America used
highte to take out one of their leaders
now if if Iran plans to take Trump out I
think they need to do it before he gets
elected because solomane was not the top
guy in Iran Trump is not the top guy in
the United States yet if they wait until
he is the top guy and they take him out
Iran is going to
disappear if they take him out now the
Democratic party is going to say oh
that's so terrible oh I sure wish that
hadn't happened and we're not even going
to be able to agree on a
response so if they take him out before
he gets elected or even before he gets
sworn
in um that's their best play and if
they're the ones Behind These
drones Trump would be completely
unprotected in any outdoor event
unless the military just owns the sky
over any Trump traveling and and
remember they would have to own the guy
over where his his automobiles are so if
he's if they land at the airport and
they drive to the venue you've got to
protect the whole thing you've got to do
the
sky because remember Solomon a was in a
car
right so if Iran wanted to Simply say
we're just giving it back to you the way
you gave it to us we're not escalating
we're giving you back exactly what you
gave us we're going to take a guy who's
not number one and we're going to take
him out in his car and we're going to
take him out using
technology and we're and then we're
even now I can't read their
minds but I would if I were if I were a
ran and I absolutely had to get revenge
it's the only way I would be thinking
about doing it I wouldn't even be
thinking about anything else honestly
because if they took out let's say a
senator that it's not going to
the United
States um but it wouldn't seem like it
was equal to Solomon yeah you need
somebody who is like involved in it but
not the president
yet I hate to
say that uh the risk to Trump right now
is a higher risk than I've ever seen for
anybody ever honestly because I'm not
even sure that you know the Deep State
even cares to protect them at this point
so this is the highest level of threat
by far now part of this
context is that we're going to see what
I call the comma collapse now I'm going
to Brand this with two KS k for kamla
and K for collapse uh cuz it looks
funnier and uh according to the guardian
Trump's making gains as the poll figures
trigger anxiety for the Harris campaign
you know you're seeing all the cat in
the roof stuff it's like well you know
privately they're very
worried uh we've heard reports that
their internal polling which we imagin
to be a higher quality because it's more
expensive than the free stuff um is
saying that Harris is in a lot of
trouble
um the uh the Guardians 10day polling
average tracker showed them um the
Harris was still ahead but down from 4%
to two 2% within the margin of error and
if Trump is and if Trump is within the
margin of error on the national vote
that's probably a landslide in the
Electoral College because that's just
the way it
works and uh so
how worried are the Democrats well a
political analysis they looked at 20 of
Trump's rallies and they found out that
he's uh he's really doing a lot of
demonizing of minority groups in all of
them demonizing minority groups I've
never heard that
once I've listened to Trump for years in
detail I've never heard him demonize a
minority group have you do you know what
they mean when they when they say he's
demon izing a minority group he's saying
that the murderers have bad genes
murderers specifically murderers he was
very clear not people in general
murderers and that they're polluting the
blood of this country the murderers the
criminals the
murderers and then the bad guys say he's
talking about people from other
countries that racist that never came
out of his mouth and I'm pretty sure he
doesn't think
it do do you think that Trump TR with
all the people he's met in his life all
the different you know demographic
groups the races the
religions do you think he's disliking
the ones who are nice to him if there's
one thing we know about Trump for sure
it could be the worst person in the
world but if they said you know I'm Pro
Trump trump would immediately Say Hey I
love you you want to have
dinner you're you're on the team
yay Trump doesn't demonize anybody who
likes him
and when people don't like him he's
really really good at staying away from
demogra you demonizing the group he
demonizes the political group sometimes
but that's what everybody
does so if you see this desperation that
they're trying to turn Trump into a
racist by making up some
data
desperation meanwhile uh I saw this post
by Ryan ver tanan uh he's behind the
American debunk site that debunks all
the Trump hoaxes so if you haven't seen
it it's American debunk
docomo District as an administrator
parents of Black and Hispanic kids come
to pick up their kids in Trump shirts
and hats every day it seems one parent
has a trump flag on their car this
wasn't the thing two years ago I major
shift is taking place now I've noticed
the same on social
media it seems that Black and Hispanic
people in the United States are no
longer afraid of saying yeah Trump's
Trump's a better
choice and I don't believe that they
could be saying that publicly or or
doing these public displays like the
school pickups
unless private conversations are at
least balanced meaning that when they go
back to the barber shop or whatever
racist Trope you want to use that uh
that people are at least
split and I believe that in maybe 2016
2020 you couldn't really admit that you
were a trump supporter if you were Black
Or Hispanic without getting an
unpleasant push back I feel as though
the unpleasantness of the push back is
over or people just said I don't care
how unpleasant it is which is also
telling so to me this is actually a
bigger indicator than the poles the
poles we worry that they put the
assumptions in them that they want to
put in them to get the result they want
but if you see people suddenly go from
afraid to Not Afraid and it's
widespread fear is the biggest
Persuader fear is
gone fear is gone apparently the migrant
push
uh is scary for the people who have the
most to lose the people who would be
competing the most for those kinds of
jobs Etc and they
noticed and appear and the the fear of
this you know white supremacist magical
group then nobody seems to know where
they are who they are or doesn't see any
indications of trouble it it shifted to
um I can see these people and they don't
have jobs which means they want to get
one which means they're competing with
me and wait why are they getting all
this money that if if I knew you had
this much money to help people in
America why wasn't I getting it where's
my reparations and all that so I think
this is real this the shift is real and
it's based on what is the
scariest and the scariest is now the
migrant situation and not some magical
white supremacist and it really helps
that Trump was President once and
nothing of the worst case happened and
in fact he was he was pretty good in a
lot of things that black Americans
like well there's evidence that uh KL
Harris's audiences are fake Michael
Tracy independent
journalist um somebody said he was
working with Glenn Greenwald on this I
don't know the details but uh he somehow
figured out that the audience was
organized by an
audience
company now you might know that TV shows
always have a live or often have a live
uh audience that live audience is not a
natural audience they're not people who
just signed up and wanted to be there
some are some are but uh they can't have
any risk that the audience is partly
empty so the people running the shows
pay a company to literally stop people
and say would you be willing to take
some money to you know to be at this
taping it's a very common thing so
apparently the
campaign is uh using this method to make
sure that her rallies do not look under
attended uh now I don't have a big
problem with that actually believe it or
not because you know politics is so fake
that if you faked your audience I would
say well you know not ideal but if you
were to list you know the top 20 things
that bother you in politics that'd be
like
21 I a lot more things to complain about
than that but on top of that uh there
was a uh cell phone analysis that showed
that most of them are from California
they're basically friendlies that follow
her from place to place so her support
does seem largely
fake now here's an interesting story
that you may have been following
forever
um rasmason and uh Patrick burn are
still talking about this one and it's
because it's not resolved so there was a
claim by a let's call him a
whistleblower but a witness who claimed
to be a u independent truck driver doing
some work for the US Post Office and the
story goes according to Patrick burn
that when he went to get his pickup in
other words other people would load his
truck and then when they're done he'd go
drive it where I was supposed to drive
and that he noticed that probably
accidentally he was loaded with fake
ballots which he saw with his own eyes
and then something happened where the I
know the truck disappeared or something
so then something mysterious at happened
after but the thinking or at least
Patrick Burn's explanation now is that
um he got into the the illegal uh stream
of trucks that were being loaded
intentionally with illegal fake ballots
and they didn't realize that he wasn't
one of theirs so they accidentally put
the fake ballots on a truck that wasn't
meant for accidental ballots and the
truck driver noticed so they had to
quickly do whatever they did to make it
go
away now Patrick burn appears he claims
he has you know knowledge that seems
confirmed according to him that he knows
exactly how the cheat happened and it
goes like this there's a ballot printing
company that uh won the contract for a
number of states there's some concern
about the ownership of the company that
maybe they have some connections to
something political Andor you know deep
state but you know that's that's an
unconfirmed we don't know that that's
part of the story or not and that um
what they do is they print the real
ballots and then they print a whole
bunch of extra fake
ballots so the best way to hide a fake
ballot printing operation is in a real
ballot company because if anybody said
did he make any fake ballots everybody
working there would say no we just made
ballots we sell ballots to the states so
did you see anything that looked wrong
no we just made ballots like we always
do what'd you do with them well we put
them on trucks did you see where the
trucks go no I mean I'm not I'm not the
trucker uh I'm in charge of making these
real totally real ballots so how money
did you need to make for that state well
I don't know I'm not in charge of that
I'm just making the ballots so you could
see how very easily a company that was
set up to make real ballots could have a
hundred
witnesses to the fake ballots but not
have any idea that they were making fake
ballots they would think that they
needed to make
300,000 but really the order was for 200
and the 100,000 get peeled off put in
special truck and end up with the bad
people sent to a place now Patrick burn
even says he knows the the location and
the address where the fake ones were
filled out and there was just some major
operation where they send them to one
place uh the the the criminals are there
they fill them out and that's the end of
it now there's some kind of foyer
request they're trying to expedite to
see if they can really find some more
before the election given that it's this
close to the election and it's been
years that they haven't been able to get
satisfaction and real details um I don't
expect it to make a difference in the
election but I feel if you add this to
the uh foreign ballots that appear to be
totally fra fraudulent based on
reporting that we know now exactly how
the fraud is
done we know exactly how it's done so
does that mean that uh you know l Trump
and Whitley and RNC and all their
lawyers and
observers are they going to catch any of
this how how would they catch it are
they going to be standing next to
somehow they would know where the trucks
are going to be loaded because part of
the story is that the the uh the postal
facility where it happened was one where
they don't even do first class me mail
in other words there there's a big red
flag that these ballot should have been
nowhere near this specific postal
facility because that postal facility
doesn't do first class mail and it was
only first class mail ballots are first
class so I don't know about that claim
but it seems to me that the entire
structure of the steel is now well known
by some people who are claiming they
know it now let me be very careful
because I don't want to be
sued I don't don't personally have any
confirming knowledge that any of these
things are real or
happening I can tell you they sound
real they sound real to me if if you had
to make a list of what is more likely to
be true and you put on it uh that we
discovered um alien life on another
planet not very
likely um the the fact that we might
know exact how the election was stolen
in 2020 or some people How likely is
that way more likely than alien life way
more
likely not
100% certainly not 100% coin flip maybe
5050 now remember if you don't know one
way or another you don't have anything
to tell you one way or another I usually
settle on
50/50 50/50 means I have no idea and
there's just no no way to guess but it
could be true there's nothing about it
that rules it out on its surface based
on what you and I know about
it but it could also be
fake
5050 but it does suggest that the odds
of catching at least one of these trucks
with fake ballots is probably a lot
higher than it was in
2020 now they they would be stupid to do
it the same way so it would be
completely ridiculous to make fake
ballots if they did and then send them
to the same Postal Place where
somebody's probably going to be watching
that would be a big mistake but it
wouldn't be a big problem would it to
find a second way to do
it um is there another entity that could
print them without getting caught maybe
don't know so we got a lot of unknowns
this time but that's certainly getting
exciting um and by the way the number of
ballots that would have been on those
trucks if they were fake does number in
the low
Millions so we're not talking about
10,000 ballots we're talking
Millions we don't know how many millions
it might be 1 million but that's enough
to change every one of the Swing States
one million would change every every
swing
state all right
uh rasmason is uh sort of having fun
making fun of the other polling
companies so they're reporting that last
weekend there were zero new National
polls versus Trump Harris versus Trump
now I didn't know it was Zero I thought
some came out but their point is that
the the people who would normally you
would expect to have all kinds of new
balloting or uh new polling very
quiet why would they be
quiet well it could be they're trying to
decide whether to tweak the assumptions
that they use when they collect it to
get closer to what they expect now to be
the real result as in Trump being close
or winning so the ones that have been
showing Harris way ahead but like four
points and stuff that seems ridiculous
to me they're going to have to either
slowly or quickly close that down to
something closer to reality so things
get real quiet when people haven't
decided which way to go or how quickly
to correct that's probably what's going
on now rasmuson is closer to it than you
are and I am and if they say that's
what's going on well they're they are in
a position to have a better Instinct
about it than you and I
are let's see
uh uh the Legacy Media also from Ras
raspon noting that the Legacy Media is
pressing Republicans to deny that 20 20
was election fraud why would they be
doing that 2020 is so far away why would
they be pressing them today why would
George stephanopolous be having the
biggest Hardon in the world and can't
let anybody say anything unless they
first say that 2020 was a perfectly good
election uh well I don't know say it say
it what do you say it and and they're
just like crazy about it now because I
think they know they lost they lost the
narrative not the election yet but they
lost the narrative cuz people like me
are willing to say I'm sure the 2020
election was rigged I don't have any
knowledge of it I don't have any proof
of it but I live in a country where I
just watched every single thing
in the country be obviously rigged
everything and you're going to tell me
that the one most
rigal most easily rigged thing is the
one that isn't that is
ridiculous and let me tell you I would
love to have the mainstream media ask me
why a stupid old voter like me would
think the 2020 election might not be
pristine because I will kill
them not not kill them kill them but you
know in a verbal in a verbal way I I
would embarrass them to the point where
they would never want to talk to me have
you noticed that nobody in the
traditional news has asked to interview
me this
cycle do you think it's because I'm
canceled
it's not don't you think they would love
to have the canceled guy on if they're
trying to make uh all uh Republicans and
anybody who likes Trump looking like a
bad person I'm the person they would put
on the air they'd say well you're well
known to be a terrible racist uh what do
you say about this election nope no
they're staying away from me I have zero
media
requests do you know how many media
requests I got in
2016 continuous
non-stop be on our show B in our show
CNN B in our show MSNBC even MSNBC ad
man and uh total number of mediocre
requests total number for this
cycle
zero are they afraid of me they should
be they should be scared to death of me
if they give me 5 minutes I would rip
their entire structure out like nobody
has they should I don't know why I don't
know why it hasn't been done it's so
easy it's so easy you just have to push
the 2020 question right up their
ass please clarify are you saying that
if you saw an election that looked
obviously and a whack that you would
accept it is that what you're asking me
to say are you asking me to say that if
Harris won all 50 states when the
polling said it would be the opp
opposite that I should just accept that
you sound like you're getting ready to
do something terrible has somebody
gotten to you are you part of this
because there's something very
suspicious about the question you're
asking me why would he even ask me this
question you know damn well that every
single person in the world no matter
whether they're Republican independent
or uh Democrat if they see an election
that's obviously corrupt they're all
going to complain and we live in a
country where even if it does look
perfectly good the losing side's going
to complain a little but we'll probably
get away with that and you know that
probably would work out but don't ask me
a question that is so obviously
politically propaganda brainwash
stupid everybody would TR everybody
everybody every person in the
world would challenge an election if you
could look at it and with your bare eyes
it looked obviously corrupt everybody
would question that stop asking the dumb
 question and Republicans can you
please wake up and just ask them
why are they asking this
question why are you asking the question
would I accept an election if it looks
like it's rigged would you George Stefan
fanopoulos would you accept an election
if it looked obviously rigged against
your team no no you wouldn't accept it
you
liar let's wrap this thing
up that's your kill
shot that's your Kill Shot let's use it
it's only going to take one person with
enough
scrotum in the Republican side to just
say the thing that needs to be said and
then maybe we can put this to
rest so that's what I think
well the hill has a story uh from
Douglas McKinnon he's an opinion
guy and the subtitle for his article is
the four reasons Harris is
losing let me tell you something that's
very
predictive if you see a story that says
there's one reason that somebody might
be
losing maybe they lose maybe they don't
if you see a story that says there are
two reasons that somebody might lose H
maybe they well maybe they won't but you
know two reasons so you're leaning in
that direction if you see a story says
there are four reasons Harris is
losing she's
losing it's
over do you remember um in win bigley my
book my book that you can see over my
this shoulder is uh just recently
re-released you can get it on Amazon and
one of the things I talk about there is
that after um Hillary lost
there were something like 14 or 20
different reasons giving for why she
lost when you see the long list of
reasons why somebody's behind it's over
it it's so predictive you just don't see
that story unless it's over now of
course the cheat the cheat is still an
option so we don't know you know what's
going to happen in the end but in terms
of who's going to get the most votes in
the right
places uh every signal is flashing Trump
every signal is Trump right now very
brightly oh here's the dumbest guy in
the news there's this guy uh who's a
governor of Utah I guess Spencer
Cox and Trump was praising him in Utah I
guess saying what a good Governor he was
but at the same time Cox was on the news
saying that he wasn't going to vote for
Trump because of January six how dumb do
you have to
be how dumb do you have to be to say
that the world will be terrible if
Harris is elected it won't be nearly as
bad if Trump is elected he says that he
even hopes that Trump you know gets
elected and does a good job but he's not
going to vote for him you're a
idiot you're a idiot there's
nothing else to say about this if you're
not going to vote for the person you
know will save the country and the other
one could destroy it because of your
little January 6 believing in
because you got brainwashed because
you're such a weak-minded piece of
that you think that the News tells the
truth and then you believed
it and you're going to let you're going
to help destroy the country because you
believe
that that's pretty dumb that's pretty
dumb Tim wal went pheasant hunting to
prove that he's a guy uh he did wear
crotchless pheasant hunting pants
but I'm not going to judge
him they they were crotchless but they
went over his regular pants so his junk
was not hanging out
but if you show me Tim wson any kind of
crotchless out outfit I'm not going to
ignore it I'm not
no um I will note that the rumor I
hinted at yesterday about Tim wall
is still uh blazing online I don't know
if it's going to calm down or go further
um I'm going to stay with my view that
uh I would need a lot more evidence of
the allegations before I would even
detail them so because it's in the news
at least the social media news I'm going
to mention it because it's a variable
and it might be important so he's
accused of doing something so bad that
I'd rather not say it unless there's a
lot better evidence of but um I don't
think now you can I mean if you're just
if you're not a public
figure maybe you believe it you could
talk to your friends about it but as a
public figure I feel like I have a a
little bit more responsibility and I
don't feel a strong pull of truth to
this one it's it doesn't have a strong
pull of Truth it could be you know any
Claim about anybody could surprise you
and be true
but I don't know I probably better
against it but it's closer to a coin
flip in my
mind so you won't see it in any of the
major media and the fact that you don't
see it in any of the major media is
exactly why I think I'll stay away from
it but it's there just so you know
meanwhile over on MSNBC they had John
Brennan on and he said that Trump and
Putin have been best buds for a number
of years and uh that they were talking
to him because Woodward's book uh said
that Trump had talked to Putin several
times since he left office now have I
told you a million times that if what
you know is what happened you don't know
anything if you know who was
involved then you know
everything so you see this in almost all
the news stories tell me what happened
and I'm clueless I did it did that
really happen is that the right context
why' they do that what what's behind it
you don't know anything the facts tell
you nothing until you find out which
team is behind it once you know what
team is behind it well then you you have
a good idea what's going on here's the
team what do MSNBC John Brennan and Bob
Woodward all have in common go let's see
how well trained you are in the comments
you tell me what the three of them have
in common you could do funny answers
funny answers are allowed but there's a
serious one what is the funny the
serious
answer uh I'm seeing in the comments
people are putting the accus accusations
down there for
walls so here's what they have in
common MSNBC is commonly uh considered
to be a Democrat SL intelligence organ
that is not really a real news station
but rather a propaganda machine for the
CIA and deep state is that true I don't
know but that's that's the
accusation John Brennan used to be the
head of the CIA he was behind the Russia
collusion hoax and the uh the hunter
laptop
hoax you know who he
is how about Woodward Woodward was the
Watergate uh guy he got famous in but
weirdly some people say he didn't have
much experience to get one of the best
jobs you could get in journalism at the
time which was to work at the Washington
Post but he did have some intelligence
background and the Washington Post often
accused of being really just a tool of
the intelligence
state so what you have in common with
MSNBC Woodward and Brennan is that they
would be associated with the worst Trump
hoaxes and that they would be basically
sanctioned by a number of Spooks in our
government now does the story look
different the story if you if the if you
only knew the facts it would look like
um maybe something to worry about with
Trump and Putin little too chummy but as
soon as you know that the three entities
involved are MSNBC Brennan and Woodward
you can completely dismiss
it you can completely dismiss it now I
see somebody said TDS nope no this isn't
a TDS story John Brennan definitely
doesn't have
TDS Woodward doesn't have
TDS MSNBC doesn't really have TVs they
act like it no they are part of an OP to
make Trump look bad they they are a
functioning op that you're seeing in
full form operating as a team right in
front of you one of them writes a book
one of them puts the guy who'll talk
about the book and put it in the context
that they want and they put them on the
air write a book get a CIA guy put them
on the air those are the three parts you
need for your propaganda once you see
the players if when when you when you
recognize the players you see the Ops
almost like a moving machine going
through the you know going through the
uh consciousness of the
country uh let's see uh Israel's prime
minister Netanyahu is uh uh telling the
United Nations that they might want to
get rid of their peacekeepers in Lebanon
because there's not going to be a lot of
Peace there and if they keep them there
they will be in pieces they will be the
peacekeepers in
pieces now that's sounds pretty
serious uh apparently Israel has had no
real uh invasion
success in Lebanon recently meaning that
they haven't really taken a
land which means they probably
will and um question that I wonder about
is why hasn't Israel or maybe they have
we don't know why haven't they by now
just blackened the sky over Lebanon with
drones that are just sort of circling
and waiting for somebody to pull out one
of those rocket launchers because my
understanding is they you know I don't
know 80,000 rocket launchers or whatever
and that they're
hidden and I think they're all on big
trucks and to use them they have to you
know pull them out of their hiding
temporarily and aim them it doesn't take
long unfortunately so they're not out
there very long but by now Israel should
have complete blanket coverage visually
oh maybe it doesn't work at night but it
seems like they would have so much
visual um
control of the areas where there are
likely to be rockets that they would
always have a drone that was within
Striking Distance you know within 60
seconds and probably it takes I'm just
guessing but it's got to take at least
10 minutes maybe half an hour to pull
one of these out and and and make it
fire so I would think that Israel could
get Munitions on every rocket within 60
Seconds
that they must be getting close to that
point so I think that they may want to
invade when they know that the The
Invasion will trigger all the Rockets to
come out because they're going to want
to you know Pummel Israel to try to make
a deal to quit and maybe Israel would
only do the invasion for the specific
purpose of of activating all the
launchers but not until they have
complete ability to destroy everyone as
soon as it comes out I think that's
what's going to
happen so my uh military uh
strategy you know my complete lack of
military knowledge we'll go into this
that the best thing they can do is get
rid of the Rockets that's that's the
biggest thing they have to do and to do
that they have to stimulate them to come
out of their hiding and that is only
good if they've already blanketed the
entire Sky which by now they
have so I think you're the the land
invasion is
guaranteed uh if only to you know mop
things up and make sure that the Rockets
are visible so they can destroy
them will they take and hold
land I think yes but not as Israel I
think they'll take it and they'll hold
it as a puet government so I don't the
the so-called government of leban is
sort of artificial and not even real
isn't it so I think somebody's going to
puppetize them I don't know who it'll be
all
right um ladies and gentlemen that's all
I got for today so I'm going to talk to
the uh local subscribers by the way if
you didn't know the Dilbert 2025
