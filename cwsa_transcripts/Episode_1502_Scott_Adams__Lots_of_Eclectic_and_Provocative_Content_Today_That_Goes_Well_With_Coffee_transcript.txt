it's like i was talking to myself but
then there you are
well good morning and welcome to coffee
with scott adams
um i'd like to tell you that it's the
best thing that's ever happened to you
but
i think you already knew that
shut up printer
got a ghost printer over there that's
making noise for no good reason
hey would you like to uh
enjoy today's show
more than you ever have before well all
you need is a copper margarat glass a
tanker chelsea tie and a canteen jugger
flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip perhaps
you've heard of it it's going to make
everything better watch
go
ah
can you turn off commercials at the
beginning because you missed the
simultaneous sip well
two things
uh you can watch without commercials at
the moment i i have the video live
stream also running on the locals
platform
so if you go to scottadams.locals.com
you'll find me there and the live stream
happens at the same same time but
without without commercials
now
uh i won't always have it open
on locals but at the moment it is just
to give people a sample
later it'll be closed over there so if
you want to watch it without commercials
you'd have to pay the subscription fee
but at the moment
at the moment
you get no commercials on locals
and if
if you're on youtube by the way
and you're a subscriber you don't get
commercials on youtube and if
i i hate to do a commercial for youtube
but youtube is just the best freaking
thing in the world it really is in terms
of content and entertainment that's
short enough content for your attention
span and anything you want in the world
is there
so
if there's one if there's just one
subscription service you're gonna get
i would do youtube to get rid of the
commercials and i would do that before i
would even tell you to sign up for my
own subscription
right so of all the subscription things
you could get
the one that is absolutely the best of
value is the youtube one so you skip the
commercials
well joe biden is doing something i'm
liking
am i allowed
will you allow that i can compliment joe
biden when he does things right
i hope that's okay in today's polarized
environment
but apparently the u.s
the uk and australia are making some
kind of military alliance
to just beef up our
i guess our alliances against china
now what do you think of that
good
good or bad
well i would say
good
and if trump had been doing this i would
say thumbs up
but biden's doing it so i'm going to say
thumbs up for him too this looks like
exactly what we need to do
the smart people are saying that the
only way to contain china is for the
non-china countries to
band together as sort of a you know a
safety group
and
this is just perfect
everything about this i like is there
anybody who doesn't like this is there
anybody who doesn't think is a good idea
for the uk australia and the u.s to have
a
an alliance
against china
somebody says bad i saw one person say
bad
i know to me this just looks like a home
run and it's exactly what we should be
doing
so good on biden for that
all right i'm gonna
make you mad again um so
general milly has finally commented on
his
talking to
china
and sorry about the allergies
today it's bad
and i told you that
after reconsidering i gave general milly
a pass
on his call to china it's not my job to
give him a pass but
i suppose as as an observer we all get
an opinion
um
and he said that his call was uh just
normal stuff perfectly within the duties
and the responsibilities of a job
and that uh
calling it calling another country to uh
um reassure both allies and adversaries
that we have strategic stability
to which i say
i don't know i think that was his job
at the same time maybe he needs to get
fired and i'm not i don't think that's
inconsistent
meaning that
maybe he did go over
biden's head if that's the case he needs
to go
but if he was just doing his job and i
think he makes a reasonable case that
this was within the realm of just normal
work
he's fine now i'm not going to give
general mili a pass in general
no pun intended
i mean i'm not saying that
that what he did in afghanistan was an a
plus obviously
but
god i've got sorry just the allergy is
killing me today
it's gonna be embarrassing
more than usual
but
yeah he still looks dumb but i think
this i think maybe we got a little ahead
of ourselves on this general milly
bashing
and
because he's a military guy
would you agree
that his military
service requires that we give him extra
a little extra consideration
don't you think just seems reasonable
and he gave however many decades of
service to his country
and i think we owe him in return the the
the highest level of
um
giving him the benefit of a debt
the highest level
which doesn't mean he's perfect but in
this case i'm gonna i'm gonna give him
that benefit of a doubt
rasmussen poll
uh asks if uh biden has humiliated the
country
with his uh abandoning of americans
behind taliban lines
and 70 percent of people asked by our
rasmussen poll
said that they agree or somewhat agree
that he's humiliated the country
how many people do you think
thought that we had not humiliated the
country
about 25
you know the standard 25 percent who
gets every question wrong
anything that anything that's 70 percent
or more
you should regard as a hundred percent
because there's always that 25 percent
who resist all common sense
they resist any kind of data
and they're just going to say the
opposite of whatever makes sense no
matter what the question is
so seventy percent say it's a
humiliation i think you could call that
a hundred percent
here's a weird thing
if i said to you
my favorite music or favorite song or
favorite band
is x
what what would likely be your comments
well let's try it i'm going to try an
actual experiment
um
i enjoy kanye west's music
in the comments
tell me if you agree or disagree
i enjoy kanye west's music
i'm not saying every song but as an
artist tremendous body of work
seeing lots of yeses but lots of no's
lots of no's
now isn't that a normal response
don't you think a normal response to
anybody saying they
like an artist or like some music is a
bunch of people say yes
and then some other bunch of people
would say no
wouldn't that be the most normal
response you'd expect right
but here's the weird part
so most of you already know that akira
the dawn
created a new form of music
he calls a meaning wave
that involves some podcaster voices such
as mine his newest one has my voice on
it and it's it's modified and it becomes
sort of the lyrics to the music
and it works way better than it sounds
when i describe it
but here's the weird thing
so
you know i've been part of helping to
promote it by the way i don't have any
financial interest in it
i have zero financial interest
so when i promote it
it's because i think it's fun
that's it i don't have any any interest
in it financially
but i haven't heard a single person say
they don't like it
i've never seen that before
can you imagine
promoting in public
a musical
music related content
and having nobody say they don't like it
nobody
literally not one person
now i've heard people who haven't seen
it or haven't heard it but i haven't
heard anybody doesn't like it
um
some people say they won't listen to it
i'm looking at some of the comments
oh okay i got one i got one here
okay so if i force the question i guess
you know you could always get somebody
who doesn't like anything music like
everything else all other art is
subjective
but i was kind of surprised at how
positive the response has been even you
know obviously not everybody likes
anything
anyway so check that out
um
if i were to ask you what is the one
health related
alpha practice
think of all the things you do for your
health
okay
all
the things every every element of things
that get to your health
and be expansive about it you know don't
do just the obvious eating and exercise
but just think of
all the things you do for your health
what's your number one
what's the one you got to get right
in the comments tell me what's the one
thing
you just got to get right
oh breathing is a good uh that's a good
answer that's not what i was going for
but whoever said deep breathing
you should look into that
so i'm not a big
proponent or expert on breathing
but i feel like there's probably
something there so i'd say research that
on your own i can't give you much on
that
a lot of people saying diet the answer
is sleep
sleep
because do you know what sleep
influences
your diet
do you know what sleep influences
your exercise
do you know what sleep influences
your social life
and all of those things affect your
your health right
you have to get to sleep right
and in fact i'm going to reveal to you
an extreme bias i have
in judging people
i don't like to judge people
so it's not that i'm judging you know
their value as human beings that's not
what i'm getting at but i do judge
people in terms of whether they would be
effective
effective you know can they do stuff
can they get stuff done can they set a
you know set a path for themselves and
then follow it
check their sleep patterns
it'll tell you everything you know need
to know about a person
everything you need to know about a
person
you can deduce from their sleep patterns
and once you know that all the rest is
obvious to you show me somebody who has
a bad sleep pattern and i'll show you
somebody who doesn't eat right
every time
and part of it's because of the lack of
sleep
if you did you know that being
sleepy makes you hungry
how many of you knew that
in the in the comments tell me did you
know
that being sleepy
makes you hungry
and not hungry for a good reason
it doesn't make you hungry for the right
reason you just confuse the two feelings
your brain confuses them
yeah
so imagine if you got your sleep right
suddenly your diet is better suddenly
you've got uh enough energy to exercise
suddenly you've got enough little extra
energy to go out and socialize now your
social life is better people are
happier to be around you because you got
the right kind of energy
everything
so i was uh
on
cnn they've got a very useful article by
the way as much as i mock cnn
um and this is good practice by the way
i like to model this i i recommend this
all the time don't think you're a very
credible person if you can't say
something good
about whoever you're criticizing
all right if you can't do that
you're probably not a credible
observer of anything right
one of the things that i note about cnn
who i
mock continuously
is that their non-news content
is often really good
like when they do the history stuff
history of the united states like the
70s and the 60s it's really good stuff
very strong content
and a lot of their health related stuff
is really strong too so there's an
article on cnn about sleep being the you
know the main system you need to get
right psychologist john duffy and he
says
here's a strong statement from somebody
who's a psychologist a working
psychologist
he says i find that the development of
better sleep habits is among the
quickest
most effective ways to improve mental
well-being for an individual
or a family
for an individual
or a family
that's right if you're not getting
enough sleep
you might be messing up with the whole
family
right imagine if any if one of the
parents doesn't get enough sleep
what happens to the spouse what happens
to the kids well you know the answer to
that right
one member of the family not having good
sleep patterns just messes everything up
in the family you've probably seen it
i'm yourself i'm sure
um
so all right so take this
take this as uh
as the base for the next conversation
how let me ask you this how many of your
kids
uh get to bed somewhat on time during
the school week but then stay up way
late on the weekends
how many of you have kids that have that
pattern or yourself
how many of you have that pattern where
you sleep completely different schedules
on weekends versus weekdays
all right if you do that
if you have a radically different sleep
schedule on the weekends than the
weekdays i know you will not be
successful in life
sorry
i'm sorry
it's it's it's pretty much a direct
correlation if you can't get that one
thing right
you're probably not going to have the
most effective life
because it's so obvious that you have to
get that thing right
nothing else works
if you don't have the
what is it emotional
is an emotional intelligence um
to make a sacrifice
because having the same sleep schedule
is definitely a sacrifice like every
time you go to sleep it's a sacrifice
because you want to stay up you know you
want to stay up another couple hours
it'd be fun
so it's a sacrifice
um
but yeah when you see somebody who does
the wildly different sleep patterns
depending on the day and the time
they're going nowhere
um and so if your kids are doing that
you should talk to them
all right um
facebook did a study i mentioned this
but there's more about it
the instagram might be damaging the
mental health of young girls
especially their self-esteem and how
they feel about their bodies
now
i'm going to go a little bit further and
say we shouldn't let anybody under 18
use social media
is there anybody left in the world who
thinks it's healthy
anybody
now i think there are plenty of pluses
of social media i'm using it right now
but for an adult
for an adult
there's lots of stuff that we don't let
kids do don't let them drink don't let
them drive
right
why is this different
you know and i heard somebody say hey
personal freedom personal freedom not
for children
there's no such thing as personal
freedom for children
that's not a standard we would ever want
to embrace
adults sure once you're 18 go wild get
your social media spend all day on it i
don't care
but as a child
you're clearly damaging children
clearly
and so why is that allowed
why is that allowed
and so it makes me wonder could we have
a somebody run for president as a save
the children candidate
who would be promoting school choice
because that's the first thing killing
kids they're not getting good educations
gotta have school choice and that means
the teachers unions have to be thwarted
stopping fentanyl from china
as a top priority
banning social media for anybody under
18
and maybe you could throw in you know
free health care for children or
something i mean
in effect children have some form of
free health care because they're not
going to get turned away
but i think it should be official i
think if you're under 18 it should just
be free health care
now um
would that person win
who exactly runs against the pro-child
candidate
school choice not as important as you
think scott
it's not the school choice part so much
it's the getting the teachers unions and
of full control because then you let
competition do its thing
so on day one school choice doesn't make
much difference
i would say
on day one
on uh
but you know check back in five years
and competition should make a difference
all right
um the number of states
with obesity
uh i forget the exact thing they
measured but something like uh twice as
many states have too much obesity since
2018. it's like a
gigantic increase in obesity in the
united states
now i asked my followers
who follow my content in any form
if they lost weight or gained weight
during the pandemic
and here are the answers
so people who say they follow me
um their answers were i think 27 percent
here it is um 27
of my followers lost weight during the
pandemic or 2020 anyway
but two-thirds either stayed the same or
no two-thirds actually stayed the same
or lost weight
two-thirds that's not bad
one-third
uh gained
now
uh
somebody says you played a small role in
me losing 120
128 pounds
my god
wait a minute what was the name on that
kevin smith
you're not the kevin smith are you who
lost a lot of weight
uh probably not probably a lot of kevin
smith's
um
you lost 55 pounds holy
lost 25. i'm just reading the comments
yeah not that kevin smith you've been
asked that before lost 15.
i've just
lost a heart
uh
lost 10 lost 15. great job
7 so far
20 35 lost 20 oh my god lost 45
well
are you seeing these comments i'm
looking at two different platforms so
you don't see them all
lost 40
lost 35
lost 35 89 100 is that true
jason did you really lose 100 pounds
oh my gosh
lost
50 lost 73 are these real
seriously is this real
i'm a little blown away right now
lost two good job
lost
30 but uh heartbreak sorry
um lost 15 lost 30.
i lost 15 but it was my dog
[Laughter]
that was funny but
it was terrible
oh my god lost 25 lost 51.
now i think you're just making stuff up
this couldn't be true could it lost 14
20.
my god
um
incredible
i lost weight because you stopped eating
during the toilet paper shortage
that's funny anyway
um
congratulations so the reason i asked
and i don't think i could tell from my
unscientific twitter poll is that i had
a
i had a hunch that people who followed
my content would be more likely to lose
weight and get in shape
during a crisis
because if there's anything i've taught
you
it's how to use a crisis to your
advantage i mean i talk about it all the
time and i talk about health and fitness
all the time so it did it did seem to me
that people who follow me would have
greater weight loss
or weight maintenance than other people
all right
um
so ron desantis there in florida
apparently he had a good thing going
there with the regeneron and he was
setting lots of stations to get
regeneron if you had covet
but now the biden administration and
health and human services have decided
to ration it to the states
because it totally screws up his whole
plan that was working great
now he's got a rash
rash in it and it's not not going to
work as well
now
do you believe any graphs you see on on
the internet
because you really shouldn't
you really shouldn't
so this morning alone i saw two graphs
one showing that the death rate in
florida recently in just the last few
days has plunged
it's plunged it was way up there spiking
for the summer but now it's plunging
and then i saw another one that says
it's worse than ever
or it's near the peak
now both both of those pieces of data i
saw today one was official and one was
on the internet now they're opposites
and it's as opposite as you can get
you couldn't be more opposite than the
curve has already crashed to the curve
is at the top
don't believe
any graph you see on the internet
i don't know how more forcefully i can
tell you that
don't believe
any graph
on the internet i i don't know the last
time i saw one that was credible
what about three graphs on the internet
well good question
speaking of graphs you should not
believe on the internet today i saw
another one
uh
uh that there were more traffic
fatalities in 2020 than any year since
2007
which and i think paul collider was
tweeting this
and this would suggest that more people
died on the highway during the pandemic
than during normal traffic
what do you think
true or false
now apparently this is
okay i just realized that i was reading
a
a tweet
about traffic deaths from somebody whose
last name is collider
okay
so
the uh
that was the simulation talking to us
do you believe that
so somebody said they were hearing it
during 2020
uh
no
no this can't be true now here's the
argument for how it could be true
the argument for how it could be true is
that with less traffic
the traffic speeds went up
which might suggest fewer small
accidents but more fatalities
right
i don't think so
i'm not buying any of this
and then it also said
that the amount of miles driven was down
13 in 2020. do you buy that
do you think the miles driven was only
down 13
in 2020
that can't be even close
can it
i would have said at least 25
i don't think it's even close
so i'm going to say that this data looks
to me so so obviously ridiculously wrong
now
let's be fair
i predicted that deaths that net deaths
might actually go down this is before i
knew the pandemic was an endemic but
when it looked like it was going to be a
temporary pandemic
i suggested that maybe the death rate
would go down
because you'd save so many people in car
accidents it might pay for the rest now
it turns out the car accidents is a tiny
amount of how many people kovit can kill
so it wouldn't have made that much
difference in the end
um so my that was maybe the worst
prediction i've ever made
so the point is
i had a
i had sort of a prediction out there
that would make me look wrong if this is
right so am i suffering from cognitive
dissonance
because that's the trigger
the trigger for cognitive dissonance is
that you've you've committed to some
belief
and then you're proven that it's wrong
and then instead of changing your mind
you just fantasize some way that you're
really right after all
am i doing that
in your opinion am i doing that right
now
because it feels like it i might be
it might be
because my my sense that the that this
data is completely wrong
is just sort of a judgment
right it just just feels like it's wrong
it feels like it's way wrong
but that could be cognitive dissonance
right
so i wouldn't take my word for this this
is one of those situations where you
have to learn
learn to look for your own triggers
so how much credibility should i put in
my own opinion right now
normally i give my own opinion pretty
high credibility
but how much should i give my own
opinion
that this traffic data is probably wrong
how much how much weight should i give
my own opinion
not much
unfortunately because
i have a trigger
there's a trigger
and the trigger is that i publicly said
i think you know at one point i said i
think that the deaths might actually go
down net
but now it looks like not only did they
not go down but they got they went up
that's the trigger
so in theory i should be triggered into
cognitive dissonance but
as i i saw somebody mentioned on the
internet yesterday if you're aware of
the triggers
can you avoid them
the fact that i'm aware
that this is a probable cognitive
dissonance trigger for me personally
does that help me get out of it
nope
that doesn't help at all
you would think you would think it would
you think
that just knowing you're in a situation
that pretty much guarantees you're going
to get triggered you'd think that that
would help you not get triggered
doesn't
doesn't change my opinion one bit
and i'm aware of it
i'm completely aware of it
that i'm probably not right
still doesn't change my opinion that's
how it works
that's how cognitive dissonance works if
i could just
know what it was and then avoid it i'd
do it
but you can't
it doesn't work that way logically it
doesn't work that way because cognitive
dissonance is the thing you can't tell
you have
well laura loomer how many of you know
laura loomer she's a
often described as a
far-right activist
who they say
oh that's
carpe uh duncan was saying what about
the majority of people on the road being
people who can't afford
not to work
and they're statistically worse drivers
the people who can't afford not to work
so in other words low income people
would be worse drivers
i don't know that there's any
you know statistical backing for that
i know seems to me that a lot of
blue-collar drivers
have trucks
and when was the last time you saw let
me ask you this when was last time you
saw a automobile accident that involved
a pickup truck
think how many pickup trucks there are
on the road
i've never seen one
have you
i mean i know they happen
but i've never seen one
think of all the pickup trucks
i would argue carpe
that the people driving pickup trucks
are not high income probably had to go
to work
and
i don't
so it took two seconds for somebody to
post a picture on locals of a pickup
truck in an accident
i'm just saying i don't see them
i feel like low income or let's say blue
collar
i think blue-collar drivers are probably
pretty good that's my guess
and i'll even add to this uh carpe how
many blue-collar workers are drivers for
a living
i mean you got your uber drivers your
truck drivers your cab drivers
a lot of people in that uh
that economic
group that drive for a living
anyway but i
i i get the comment that was provocative
so laura loomer far right as she is
often described she's sometimes
described as
anti-muslim i don't know if that's an
accurate description
and she's been the anti-vaccination
and of course
what do you think happened
to a notable far-right person who is
anti-vaccination
that's right she got a bad case of the
coronavirus and apparently it's just
kicking her ass and it hurts like crazy
she's doing regeneron and hydrox
chloroquine and some other stuff
but here's my
take on this
you know this was reported in the the
daily beast and a lot of other outlets
picked it up
but
is there some kind of creepy level of
implied
delight in these stories
are you picking that up
i feel as if these are presented to the
audience of these various publications
as like a
candy
it's like oh this is going to make you
feel good
let me tell you about somebody who had a
really bad experience
on the other team
it's going to make you feel great
i feel like it's creepy
isn't it
now i get why it's newsworthy we all
understand why it's newsworthy and i
even think that if they're trying um
to persuade people to get vaccinated
that they probably really believe that
that's a good thing
and then it's
excuse me
and
and i think probably
you know they they think they're helping
but
it feels like just
the worst of humanity doesn't it
now i'm not gonna you know defend
anything that laura loomer does
right that's for her laura loomer can
defend herself
so she has to defend her views that's
not me but
when we say that because of her views
on other topics
well also the vaccination views that
therefore she's maybe
um
an object of entertainment
entertainment
how do you feel about that
there's somebody sick and they might die
and you're like laughing at it
because oh irony
yeah i guess they were right or no i
guess they were wrong
it just feels creepy and awful
really but i get wise i get why it's in
the news i mean
we all understand that
all right
i believe
that that
is just about everything i wanted to say
um
yeah thoughts and players yeah the
herman cain thing same thing
how many how many people on the left
were celebrating the death of herman
cain
i mean that's just creepy and awful
um
you under somebody says they unfriended
people who
uh
were happy when trump got coronavirus
yeah that
oh sleep advice somebody's asking for
some sleep advice well since i talked
about it let me give you some sleep
advice
all right now this is pretty basic stuff
you could google this and you'd see the
same advice
number one
have the same schedule as i mentioned go
to bed around the same time you know
within an hour or so and get up about
the same time within an hour or so
makes a huge difference even on weekends
now
uh and when i go to bed too late i still
get up early to try to reset myself at
least for the day after you might have
to burn a day
because sometimes you just have to stay
up late you don't have a choice
but but i'll burn that day and
readjust and readjust for the next day
you don't want to be in a permanent bad
sleep situation
next thing is don't look at too many
screens after you go to sleep
screens keep you awake
next make sure that you have exercised
that
day uh i don't know how universal this
is but i suspect it's probably just a
normal physiological thing on days that
i exercise i sleep like a baby
pretty much every time
and days that i did not get enough
exercise i do not
now that might not apply to you i don't
know how much that's individual but the
general advice
is to
track
what things you did during the day and
how that affected your sleep
i've tracked this and i can tell you
it's one to one
if i exercise i sleep well if i don't i
don't
you know
short of any kind of emergency that
happens at night it's just one to one it
just works every time
i would not uh if you're doing
sleep
stuff
sorry
if you're doing
ambien or some kind of sleeping pill or
something like that
uh the total number of times i've taken
ambien in my life is zero
the time the total number of times i
plan to take ambien in my life is zero
i mean i just that's a pretty heavy drug
to put in your body just to get to sleep
now i get that sometimes maybe people
just need it
but
you're doing everything wrong
if you need that
now i do admit that marijuana is a big
part of my sleeping
schedule
indica specifically don't do sativa that
wakes you up there are two kinds of two
general kinds of marijuana and then lots
of subtypes with them but if you do the
one subtype it wakes you up and it's
good for working and the other type
makes you relaxed and it's good for
sleeping so indica is the one that's
good for sleeping if you don't use it
any other time during the day
because you know you don't want to lose
your edge or whatever it is you don't
want to do
if you do it before bedtime
it's
probably going to be fine and you wake
up actually feeling refreshed you don't
wake up feeling stoned
i'm seeing some people uh suggest
melatonin i have no experience with it
and i'm not a doctor so i neither
recommend it nor non-recommended but it
would be on the list of things to look
into
i'd look into it if i were you and i've
seen some other
things that people suggest that i don't
have any experience with so i would say
and by the way i'm going to give you a
philosophy
you ready
this is this is a winner's philosophy
and it's one that i try to instill in
myself just by repetition right it's not
something that i naturally came by
something i developed it goes like this
if you can't sleep
you didn't work hard enough
do you feel that
if you can't get to sleep
it's not because you're bad at sleeping
it's because you didn't work hard enough
if you work hard enough you'll sleep
period
if you work hard enough
you will sleep in fact you won't even be
able to avoid it
sleep will be guaranteed
so now of course
that's not you know perfectly true
correlation right
but uh i find it good as a philosophy
because it tells me that i've got i've
left something on the table
it told me that i left something on the
table that day i either didn't exercise
enough
didn't put enough work in you know
creatively or a number of hours
there's something i did wrong
that day
and so the
the thing is to fix it all right now
suppose you're in bed
it's uh two in the morning and you can't
sleep what do you do
because this is technique as well well
here's what the experts say if you stay
in bed and can't sleep you will be
training yourself that bed is a place
you can't sleep
do you get that
this is a hypnotist trick
we associate things automatically so
anytime two things happen at the same
time we start associating them
so if you lay in bed at 2 a.m and you're
in bed like actually under the covers
and you can't sleep
what do you do
because you don't want to stay in bed
not sleeping
because that will train you the bed is
where you don't sleep
you get up
over on the
locals platform i won't name your name
but we have the helpful suggestion to
masturbate
now
i didn't bring it up
but
if you can't get to sleep after
masturbating
well
it certainly makes things easier if you
can pull that off so to speak if you can
pull it off you know what i mean wink
wink
um
so let me finish my point if if he can't
sleep
try masturbating
very good sleep technique quite serious
about that
and
secondly if you can't sleep get up
get up
so
being a being awake and walking around
when you can't sleep
is is how you want to train yourself
what happens if you get up and stay up
for license let's say 20 minutes half an
hour
you'll want to go back to sleep
because it turns out that if you get up
at two in the morning
what happens to you
you get really tired
just try walking around at two in the
morning
if you're still wide awake at two in the
morning
just stay up maybe you didn't you just
didn't need enough sleep you'll be
you'll be tired the next day
so the next day you'll probably you know
catch up just keep yours your time to
bed the same
now um i've told you that there are a
number of times that i wake up at 3 a.m
when i'm not planning to
you know i set my alarm for five
that's like the latest i would like to
ever sleep but i don't like to get up to
the alarm
somewhere between 3 and 4 30 is my sweet
spot
and if i'm awake at 3am
i just get up
and i've never really felt any bad
impact from it
and
yes and sleeping during the day is is
bad if you need to take a nap here's
another hint
if you need to take a nap
30 minutes
maximum
if you sleep for two hours during the
day you're in trouble
your whole sleep pattern will be messed
up but 30 minutes
you can just
take the edge off of your exhaustion and
maybe get get to bedtime on time
yeah 21 minutes somebody says my naps
are 21 minutes that's a strangely
specific number
but that's about right yeah 20 30
minutes
um
all right just see if you have any other
tips
somebody says smoke a cigarette i'm not
going to recommend that
um
yeah now have you tried asmr
if you don't know what asmr is google it
give it a try
it'll either work or not asmr
i don't know what the letters stand for
but it's uh it's weird little youtube
videos
and other places i assume
where you hear people doing
things that make
subtle background noises
or they're talking
and
it's relaxing so apparently it's just
relaxing for a lot of people to hear
people fussing around in their
environment
now have you ever had the experience of
taking a nap on the couch
when other members of your family are
doing something around the house
it's actually better isn't it you know
you'd think to yourself no the family is
noisy
so how can i take my nap well if you're
ready for a nap you can sleep through
anything right if it's not a
recreational map if you actually need an
app
you can sleep through anything and i
find it very relaxing
to
feel the just low level you know
footsteps and
and you know just casual noises of
people
living their life
very relaxing
so asmr is sort of a version of that
where you hear some background noise and
it just makes you feel there's some
people around and those people are happy
and doing stuff and makes you fall
asleep
uh yes i'm seeing a comment here that
alcohol sleep is not asleep that is
correct if you drink alcohol and pass
out
you're not sleeping
in the in the good way that you want to
sleep
meditation and breathing also good
i'm not an expert on breathing exercises
but look it up i do think there's
something there
that would help a lot
all right those are some tips and
boo seems a little bit better thanks for
asking and i'll talk to you tomorrow
