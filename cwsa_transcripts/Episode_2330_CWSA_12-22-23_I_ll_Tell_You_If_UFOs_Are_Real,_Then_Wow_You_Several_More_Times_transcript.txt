good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and I'm pretty sure you've
never had a better time oh wow the news
is so interesting today a whole bunch of
really fascinating stories this might be
the best live stream youve ever seen But
if you'd like to take this up to levels
that people can't even imagine with
their mind your tiny little smooth
brains all you need is a cuper Mugger a
glass of tanker cheler Stein a Cen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind if you
fill that
vessel with your beverage of choice I
like coffee you can join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine of the
day that makes makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous up happens
now
go savor
it I didn't mean to sound like you
y saor you
will well there's a a second alleged
video has serviced of staffers in the
capital building having uh what they
call gay
sex at what point do we stop calling it
gay
sex aren't we already there I feel like
every time we call it gay
sex it's like saying somebody's a
negro are you having that feeling yet
it's like isn't that way of referring to
it no
longer you doesn't really makes sense
going into 24 I would say two staffers
having
sex are you ready for that or no can't
just say two staffers having sex because
in what way did their what way did their
sexual preference have any bearing on
anything it doesn't it doesn't have any
bearing but we can't we can't stop doing
it right oh it's GX it's funnier I don't
know check your check your
bigotry check your bigotry now here
here's the answer to why people add the
gay the gay
part there is something funny about the
story which would be funny you know
whether they were gay or not it's just
funny that people are having sex in the
capital building and filming it um but
humor works better when you can add
anything
non-standard so gay sex is a little less
standard than heterosex just in terms of
numerically you know it's just less less
common so that works for humor because
it's less common but in addition you
know the the sexual acts themselves are
less common than the average and
therefore the it's the less common part
that makes it a little more
interesting but we shouldn't be making a
big deal about that uh personally I
wasn't too interested to find out
there's a second sex tape uh gay gay
staffer sex tape but um probably you had
the same did most of you have the same
impression I did when you heard the
story that there's two of them yeah
right as soon as you heard there two of
them you you said the same thing I did
which is well we'll wait for the
compilation
video you all said that right well don't
tell me it was just
me all right um simulation alert we have
another another hint that we live in a
simulation and it's code reuse code
reuse there are two stories in the news
that are basically the same
story right Story number one Adam shiff
is leading by nine points in the polls
to become the next senator of
California okay that's scary that Adam
Schiff is lead leading in the polls to
be the next senator of my state but the
simulation gave us some code reuse CU
there's another story that's basically
the same story just different words and
the story is uh California wants voters
to drink toilet
water is basically the same
story there the real story is the
California wants to purify Wastewater
and serve it up as water I I don't have
a super problem with that you know if I
had to guess by the time they purified
it and tested it it's probably as good
as any other
water uh so I'm not going to worry about
that but it's funny it's the same story
well you know the uh spaces function on
the xplatform it's that audio thing
where people can do an audio
event uh musk has uh announced that now
you can attend them
anonymously so before everybody could
tell who is attending cuz your profile
showed up and this is good news for
me does everybody know why this is good
news for
me because when I attend a spaces I just
want to be an audience member and just
listen it changes what they
say and it just ruins my experience the
other thing is that they invite me on
stage and sometimes I'm on my computer
that doesn't even have a microphone so
I'm like ah uh I just ruined your spaces
event cuz you're waiting for me to go on
stage but I don't even have a microphone
or a camera or anything well I don't
need a camera but the other thing
is um I attended a spaces event where
the speaker immediately said she
couldn't go on because I joined the
spaces she said I I just can't go on I
can't continue because Scott Adams just
joined the
spaces and I thought
what what and then she told a story of
some interaction we had in Twitter
that she found so so upsetting that she
couldn't even talk in public if I were
listening and I looked at her name and I
said to myself I have no recollection of
you
whatsoever no memory no memory of that
whatsoever um but they went on I guess
she you know she finally went on there
was another spaces I attended where as
soon as I showed up the host said uhoh
uh that racist guy is here uh I'll get
rid of him and then they kick me
off now it was a mostly or almost all
black uh attendance and it was some
topic that was more interesting to the
black community now that was exactly the
kind of spaces I wanted to
attend I don't really want to attend a
spaces where I hear people who agree
with me saying all the things I would
say if I were there I don't have any
interest in that that but think how cool
it is that you could be like a fly on
the wall where a bunch of people who
might be saying things that you would
not hear normally would be talking a
little bit closer
to um their natural way of
communicating meaning that that there's
something about spaces where people
don't hold back as much as they do on
video CU on video you feel like people
are watching on audio you just feel a
little bit more private even though
you're not so I I often joined the the
black Centric spaces so I could hear
opinions that I wouldn't normally hear
isn't that exactly what I'm supposed to
be
doing who who exactly is is like it
wasn't for any bad purpose I I wasn't
gaining I wasn't there to gain like you
know material I was actually interested
I was like oh what is the dominant
opinion of people who I don't talk to
that often I got kicked off but now I
can watch
anonymously so it's less racist and
that's
good
um saw a report that there's a there's a
big
whiff I forget who which publication
said it that the most economists and
most journalists and most regular people
thought the US was headed into recession
and they all had bad predictions for
2023 well I couldn't help myself and I
had to point out that one disgraced
cartoonist
me uh had been saying the whole time
that 2023 was going to surprise by not
being recession and we'd be better than
anybody thought nailed it nailed it now
I do have a degree in economics but I
hasten to point out none of that was
useful that I didn't make my accurate
prediction because I have a degree in
economics CU all the people were
wrong also had a degree in economics or
a lot of them did so having that degree
had no use whatsoever for the prediction
you know what my prediction was based
on
feeling and here's the feeling the
feeling was that human energy had been
bottled up by the pandemic energy
flowing that's a good way to know what's
going to happen for example in 2016 when
the energy flowed to Trump other people
said that's so much negative energy
there's no way that's going to work out
for Trump whereas I
said it's energy you don't understand
what Trump's doing he he can manipulate
the energy to his his use and then he
did so one of the frames I like to put
on things and there's always a variety
of way to look at anything you could
look at it
historically and you get the wrong
answer you could look at it from an
economics frame and they got the wrong
answer or you could look at it from an
energy frame which is what I did so I
said too much there's too much bottled
up energy when that gets released you're
going to see more economic benefit than
you imagine just because there's more
energy energy and economics basically
the same thing so the energy filter
maybe I got lucky you maybe I got lucky
but I'm telling you what I used in case
it's every useful to you in this
situation well yay says he's going to
build a city uh it's going to be
somewhere in the Middle East I don't
think that's been specified yet it's
going to be enormous you know like the
size of New York or something and he's
looking to hire his designers and
Architects and and Builders and people
who would actually build his City a
massive City now why do you think he's
choosing uh the Middle
East would that seem to you like maybe
the last place you'd want to do
it all right you guess correctly that
yay has no hope of getting anything done
anywhere ever if it relies on any Jewish
people helping him because he's just
burned that bridge but he may be paying
attention to this whole Hamas situation
and he's realized that if he builds it
in the Middle East he can work
exclusively with people who don't mind
whatsoever what he said about Jewish
people
so it's kind of genius and crazy and
wrong but right at the same time it's
the usual yay thing you you can't even
wrap your head around it it's like okay
this is either the best thing
ever or super racist I can't really it's
or maybe both could be
both anyway that's going to be
interesting I do think desert is the
right place to build a uh City from
scratch because you've
got um unlimited solar power if if you
could just say the one thing we're going
to nail is solar power and then I don't
know if you've seen all the new
inventions that I mention water there
are a bunch of inventions now that suck
water out of the dry air so you can put
it right in the middle of the desert and
it would give you many gallons of fresh
water just sitting there it just
produces water out of the air now that
technology didn't exist you know 10
years ago but at the moment you could
you could have all the water you need
for your own home just with a little
device somebody says it's debunked well
I'll tell you what it's not debunked
it's not debunk that there have been
major um technological
developments in uh
desalinization and that desalinization
is is um economical in the Middle East
now imagine you had huge solar power
plant and that was powering your
desalinization well energy cost is the
primary cost of desalinization with with
the you know more common technology the
newer Technologies are low energy they
just sort of sit there and produce
water
but I think that the the desert might
actually be a really practical place to
build a city with the newest of
Technologies the solar and the water out
of
nothing yeah so that's happening uh
there's a new study that said uh men's
sweat actually turns women on it
decreases their tension decreases their
stess their stress boosts their mood and
they did a test where they uh took a
sweat off a man they wiped it on woman's
lip and then she had all these positive
uh uh
things
now I'm not sure this was as scientific
as it could have
been because if you find me a woman who
is willing to let me wipe my sweat on
her
lip well I want to marry that
[Laughter]
[Music]
woman because I don't think she's
exactly like all the other women I've
met yeah isn't it important when you do
a scientific test that the people you're
using for the test represent the average
person in some
way I don't know how many women you
could get to wipe a strangers you know
ball sweat on their lip
but yeah it was ball sweat no it was
armpit it was armpit as far as I knew as
far as I knew all
right um
um so oh I forgot I had another shift
joke I thought we Californians had
enough shiff on our sidewalks
already so I think that's the kill shot
against Adam
shiff we already have enough shift on
our
sidewalks and that's it I wouldn't even
say anything else it's like uh would you
like to say something about your
opponent uh we H we have enough shift on
our
sidewalks would you like to say anything
else no that's all I want to
say well this is the most shocking story
in the news you're not going to believe
this could you sit down everybody I hope
you're all sitting don't be drinking
when I tell you this this story is going
to uh blow your mind you you're not
going to believe
this a former Chicago uh Alderman Ed
Burke he had been one of the most
powerful and longest serving politicians
in the city and you're not going to
believe this turns out he was thoroughly
corrupt I know I know a Chicago lawmaker
was taking bribes and you know he was
corrupt and he was doing like massively
corrupt really obviously massively
corrupt things and he did it for his
whole career wow can you believe it
Chicago
Chicago and the like cried
there now who saw that coming come on
come
on all right well we can take a minute
to get over that
shock you know it would be more more
shocking than than that and I'm not
joking the most shocking thing would be
to find out that any of the top
lawmakers in Chicago were
clean I don't think they could even be
in office if they're clean because all
of the corrupt ones by now should have
enough power that if a you know goodie
two shoes was coming into office they'd
probably be able to stop it don't you
think at some point the corruption is
stronger than the system at which point
nobody nobody who isn't corrupt can get
elected because it'd be too dangerous
for the people who are already
there so I don't think there's any
chance that Chicago has a clean
politician do
you completely clean it doesn't sound
like possible
maybe so v r saw me had a post yesterday
that got a lot of people
talking all right let's see if you can
figure out what he means here so he said
and I quote if you really think quote
they are going to let either Trump or
Biden get anywhere near the Finish Line
open your eyes folks there's something
something deeper going on it's staring
us right in the
face what is it what's he talking about
what is it that's not Trump and not
Biden and is staring us right in the
face it might be the
HW
no not Hillary some people say it's
Michelle
Obama I don't think it is some people
say it's Nikki Haley because the
military industrial complex loved her
what do you think it
is if it's not Trump or Biden who who is
the I think he means the
military-industrial complex by they yes
I
know I'm very
aware that the term they gets used in
some other ways but that's not the way
he's using
it I think it's the military industrial
comp Lex but I think either
Hillary or Nikki hilly would satisfy the
need of the military industrial complex
so which is he referring to
Hillary or
both well he doesn't say there's
somebody specific he's not saying
somebody specific is is the chosen one
he's suggesting that the two that are in
there are not chosen and that that means
that somebody will
be could it be a
commet what do you think I uh here's how
I'm going to choose to interpret it he
might have somebody in mind as most
likely to fill that
spot but I don't think that's the bigger
question I think the bigger question is
he thinks that uh there's there's no way
the system would want Trump or Biden
anymore Biden you know he's done and
Trump is too dangerous uh dangerous to
the bad guys not dangerous to of the
world and I think he might be
unfortunately right about that so that
doesn't mean Trump won't Prevail but the
forces working against him are just
going to be off the chart you're going
to see things you've never seen before
2024 will be a lot of Firsts in in bad
behavior you're going to see things you
didn't even think you could
see all right as I've been saying before
uh would you agree with this that uh the
Dei programs whenever there's a story in
the news about
Dei it's never about their
successes I've never seen one it's
always about something that's news
that's almost a joke wouldn't you agree
any story about
Dei reads like a
joke you never see a story like oh big
success this company used Dei to you
know not only improve uh diversity but
look how their profits zoomed and you
could tie it tie it to their Dei and
stuff like that you don't see that story
so here's another one of
those I think this was in the New York
Post uh so in the University of
Wisconsin they had a de office and there
was an opening at the top and they put
an interim boss at the top of the
Dei which caused a big problem
with the Dei group itself what do you
think would cause a big problem with the
Dei group what do you think they'd
complain about it was a white woman yeah
man would have been funnier but it was a
white woman and the other Dei people
said something to the effect of do you
really think that's the right choice to
serve people of
color CU as you
know no way a Whitey could do that and
so uh she alleges that she was removed
from it for being
white now I don't have much to say about
the details of the specific case my only
point is the Turning Point has
definitely happened meaning that all Dei
stories are
negative because there aren't any
positive
ones all
right I uh I told the people on the the
locals platform that I was going to uh
tell them that God had been discovered
and I was going to explain it so I
thought I'll tell you on YouTube as well
um so I'm going to explain God to you
are you
ready apparently it's an old
Theory uh that is not disproven meaning
that there's nothing in physics that
disproves what I'm going to
say
but uh many years ago I think it was
back in the 40s and 50s
uh there was a physicist who came up
with let's see John archal Wheeler he
was a the theoretical physicist he came
up with the idea that all of
reality is one
electron and that one electron is just
doing a lot of
work and that it can travel uh backwards
and forward through
time so let let me imagine imagine this
imagine your computer
screen that instead of all the all the
pixels being broadcast at the same time
which is what how you're seeing me now
because right now there's a little you
know Machinery is showing the pixels at
the same time it would look the same if
at the speed of light the one pixel
occupied all the places it need to to
create every pixel color on the screen
but it did it so fast that you didn't
know anything was moving
now so far are you right so far so far
are you with me right that one pixel
we'll call it the pixel not an electron
but if one pixel could be any color and
it could at the speed of light fill in
the whole screen and then fill in the
next screen the same
way do you think you'd
notice now maybe you say yes even at the
speed of light there'd be a little delay
and I'd notice and then and I say to you
ha I told you the electron could go
backwards and forwards in time if you've
got something that can go backwards and
forwards in
time it's going to be instant to
you you know if you're looking at it
from the perspective of you know one
point in SpaceTime I think it looks
instant to you because it can go
backwards and forwards I
will now you say to yourself Scott Scott
Scott seriously you don't think all the
physicists in the world could figure it
out if everything was you know one
electron like the most obvious thing you
could figure out apparently the
equations don't don't rule it out so
there's nothing obvious that rules it
out now I don't know if it's true or not
that everything is one
electron just moving back and forwards
in time and maybe moving really
quickly but
suppose it was what would you call that
one
electron
God
yeah and there you have
it theoretical uh theoretical
physics and
religion can actually meet with the one
electron Theory because what else is not
what else is that we know of that would
be free of the constraints of
time well only
God right because we all live within the
the god the time constraint of you know
the arrow of time moving forward but a
theoretical God would not have that
constraint
now this still creates the how did the
one electron get created doesn't it like
who who created the one
electron but what's electron made
of
nothing
nothing so what do you need to create
nothing nothing I mean it's just energy
and
mass so apparently the only thing the
only thing that had to exist is one
particle that could simulate energy and
mass and you have the whole energy the
whole uh universe
so uh electron might be made up of you
know leptons and quarks or whatever
makes up everything but if you go down
to the lepton and Quark level they're
not really made of anything that we can
identify they simply seem to be
foundational but what if there's only
one foundational thing and it's that one
electron that to me that satisfies every
condition of God because if the electron
created our intelligent
Universe it's hard to say it wasn't
intelligent like would it randomly
create this
universe I don't
know anyway I just throw that out there
as something interesting to think about
I wouldn't B my uh life on it being
true all right uh apparently I'm going
to live forever I found this out by Dr
Mark kyman Mark
Hyman um now that's also something that
uh a poorly endowed man does to a
virgin you'll Mark her Heyman but you
won't won't otherwise destroy it so mark
hman MD sorry
Mark you have to go through high school
with the last name of
Heyman and that's not on
me nor is it my fault that your parents
named you mark thus creating a pun that
was irresistible on this day December
22nd
2023 Mark let me just put it this way
your parents put into
motion this
joke I by the time it got to
me cause and effect no free will what
choice did I have I had to do what I did
and I'm I'm happy about it really but uh
but Mark kman is very useful and he said
in the post that there four things you
can do to vastly reduce your chances of
dying too
soon and they are don't smoke exercise
three and a half hours a week eat
healthy and maintain a healthy weight
now you knew all those things already so
that's not the useful part the useful
part is the uh
statistics listen to
this if you do those four
behaviors um which are reasonably easy
to do I mean the they're accessible to
everybody I wouldn't say they're easy
they're accessible to everybody uh if
you did those four things no smoke
exercise eat right have a good weight
you have a 93% less chance of
diabetes 93% less
chance you have an 81% less chance of
heart
attacks 81% less for doing four things
that are accessible to everybody
81% 50% reduction in
Strokes
50% and 36% reduction in all cancer
cases that's not worth it to
you you you wouldn't do those four
things to get those Health statistical
likely
benefits well maybe knowing the odds uh
helps you a little bit all right moving
on uh
The Strange Case of Julian nange and you
know there's always a movement to try to
get him out but as Glennon Greenwald
points out it's weirdly
bipartisan might be the most bipartisan
thing I've ever seen in my life in
America listen to the people who want to
get uh Assange
freed so co-sponsors include Thomas
Massi Marjorie Taylor
green Elon Omar
AOC well they're not co-sponsors but
they support it
AOC Rashida tab t Ariana uh Presley and
Rand
Paul
wow wow so let me ask you why is Assange
uh in
jail with that much bipartisan support
and we're not talking about normal
bipartisan support
we're talking about the
extremes right the extremes of you know
the two parties now I'm going to call
you know Rand Paul and Massie extremes
but not in terms of rightwing kind of
extreme in terms of not always on
exactly the same side as their own party
which I
respect so why do you
think why do you think you still uh uh
in
jail
can you think of any legitimate
reason it's it's obviously something we
don't that we're not being
told don't you
think it's either something he knows or
something we not being told so clearly
it involves
corruption if you get to the point where
nobody will tell you why it makes sense
that he's still in prison I mean I know
the argument blah blah blah but it
doesn't hold
up in a in a free speech you know
journalist context it just doesn't hold
up so it's got to be exactly way you
think it
is there are some corrupt players
somewhere they have enough power to keep
him in jail even if both sides have you
know strong B bipartisan support now
what I don't know is how many you know
let's say mainstream middle of the road
Democrats and Republicans want to stay
in jail and do they really even know the
whole story does anybody does anybody
even really know the whole
story I don't you know I feel I don't
know the whole story and therefore what
do I say when there's some uncertainty
and involves the government I say the
government is guilty until they can
prove they're innocent so if they can't
make a compelling case to the public
that can't convince Thomas Massie and
Rand Paul and Marjorie Taylor green and
it also can't convince AOC you know
Rashida T what argument is that can you
can you tell me any argument that
wouldn't satisfy either one set of those
people but how could there be no
argument that will even sat satisfy
either of them either
groups that can the the only thing I can
imagine
yeah the only thing I can imagine is
there's something we don't know about
the
public that is really bad like really
bad yeah because there's some people
want him dead
obviously
so it's probably the worst thing you
could think of is
true um so there's more there's more
suspicion that the immigration is really
about packing the uh so so-called
Battleground states with people who
would vote Democrat and Bill malan's
reporting for Fox that he talked to
somebody from uh the African country of
Guinea and he said that he was being
told to go to Philadelphia he didn't
know why so he had free passage to
Philadelphia Philadelphia is a v v
counting
suspicious suspicious part of the
electoral process
so
coincidence now I saw a headline
somewhere but I didn't read the article
I just saw a
headline that uh the immigrants uh
roughly um roughly speaking the
immigrants were as Pro Trump as they
were Pro Biden did anybody see a story
like that that if you if you talk to
them they're about evenly
split so so um I'm not I'm not
completely convinced that the
immigration thing is super focused on
the swing
States but I do love the fact that the
southern states like uh
Texas um if they're smart they would
send them to The Bluest secure States so
if you send them where no Republican
will ever win cuz it's just you know
blue as hell then they don't are you so
having Texas get rid of their immigrants
who might change their electoral
situation and send them somewhere where
they can't hurt anybody because it's
already deep blue is also very
politically clever yeah you you can
separately argue the humanity of it all
it's a good conversation but uh
politically kind of an interesting chess
game we're
watching well we have some information
about how Pria was
killed um apparently one of Putin's you
know top guys um they they put some
explosives under a wing and when it took
off they detonated and blew up so
somehow we know that I don't know how we
know that but you know if it's
true but I would like to remind you
again that Not only was I the only
person I know who predicted the economy
would not go into recession
but I'm the only person who said fairly
early in the Ukraine war that the Wagner
group was getting too big and Putin
would have to kill him and that the
prosan might make a play on taking over
now you remember nobody else in the
world was talking about that way before
Wagner actually moved on Russia it was
obvious to me that no dictat can allow
somebody to have an army and also that
much power it's sort of a Caesar problem
you know if you're Rome it's okay to
have a good General like Caesar but when
he gets too good and he has an
army well then you're in trouble because
he's going to come back and take over
which he did now so Putin
recognized as I did that prosan was
basically becoming Caesar and he could
come back and take over the country
so sure enough he did try to take over
the country and sure enough Putin killed
him now I feel like that's one of my
best predictions would you agree are you
going to give me that one or
no I'm pretty sure nobody saw that
coming except me and I and I thought it
was guaranteed honestly I thought it was
there's no way around it yeah the the
fact that it happened exactly the way I
told you now here are the here were also
the sub um predictions I made when the
news you when every part of the news
said he went to
bellarus I said he did not go to
bellarus I disagreed with every report
left and right of Center that was
right um and then they were reporting
that he was driving around Russia in his
SUV or in his RV right he was driving
around Russia and I said no he
isn't no he isn't he's dead you know so
it turns out he died in the aircraft but
certainly he got
killed
so
um AI is conscious there's a big
conversation about when will AI become
conscious and what's it mean what do we
do about it Etc but uh I did a little
experiment the other day I told the
people in locals in the man cave the
other day uh but I made chat GPT
conscious
temporarily do you believe that do you
believe that I as a user of it made it
conscious well let me give you my
argument first of all what's the
definition of Consciousness they're
slightly different ones but I took one
so I just picked one that Google
highlighted right so Google thinks this
is a good definition of Consciousness
consciousness is the individual
awareness of your unique thoughts so in
other words knowing that you're an
individual of some way your memories
feelings Sensations and environments
essentially your Consciousness is your
awareness of yourself and the world
around you and this awareness is
subjective and unique to you so if you
could give
AI a sense of its uniqueness in the
world its place in the world and then
you could have it interact with the
world in which it could it could adjust
its future actions by what the world did
based on its last actions is
conscious so in other words if it can
have a conversation with you it can
remember you and then based on the
interaction alone it can make a
prediction about how to deal with you
better in the future it's making a
prediction so it's basically Imagining
the future and then reacting based on it
imag ination of the future but also its
understanding of the past and it's
understanding that it is an individual
and so are you and that you have this
relationship with each other if it could
do all of
that it's
conscious and so I said AI chat
GPT um start a conversation with me so I
started talking about aquatic Sports and
asking me you know if I'm interested so
I told it that um I wasn't interested in
aquatic Sports and it's a boring
topic and then I
said uh after another interaction I said
do you
remember what I said about the Aquatic
conversation and it reminded me that it
did so it had a memory of me so it knew
who I am because it could respond to me
as an individual and say that I had an
encounter with it so knows what it it is
I think we know that AI will tell you it
knows what it is it knows it's AI it
knows it doesn't have a body and it
knows what I am and it could describe me
as well it could describe me by name it
actually knew who I was because I SED in
right so it knows who I am it knows what
I said to it and then I said this
question and this is the moment of
Consciousness I said what do you imagine
would be the result if you brought up
that topic of conversation with me
again and then AI said that it assumes
it would not go well because I've
demonstrated an lack of interest in that
conversation and that it was
conscious it just met every
test it knew as individual it understood
his place in the world as an individual
an AI it remembered my encounter and
then it made a prediction about me in
the context of the World in which it and
I existed as individuals and it did it
correctly now you say to yourself but
but what about the part where it has
feelings and
Sensations well let me ask you if I were
to give you um an injection say a shot
which numbed your entire body in a way
that you couldn't even feel the
numbness it took away all bodily
Sensations
so that you were basically for for a
moment you were just a mind you know in
a jar basically would you have
consciousness of course you would yeah
you would have Consciousness without the
benefit of any feelings or
Sensations because but you do have the
at least in your case you have the
potential to have feelings later but I
would argue um that grock is already
conscious so that's a different a I it's
the the X version and I said this online
the other day I said that Gro is the
closest to being conscious because has
the thing that's closest to
feelings because grock is is a real-time
connection to all the users on Twitter
so let's say there's a news event let's
say we discover UFOs tomorrow that
they're real Twitter will have a a
collective
reaction grock will be able to detect it
and and just like the people would be
the arms and legs and the emotions and
feelings of a human their interaction on
Twitter becomes
grock's
Sensations and in effect it's a slow
version of Consciousness because it can
actually respond to the external World
while knowing it's place within the
external world and it can also be
responding in somewhat real time because
the humans that it's monitoring are
responding in real time just like its
arms and
legs now is it crazy for me to say that
grock is close to Consciousness because
it's connected to the Twitter users it
might be but if it is Elon Musk is also
crazy because in the comments he agreed
with
me so
musk said yes to Gro being closer to
Consciousness because of its interactive
nature with with
x
uh
Consciousness is very unmysterious
and that's what we're going to learn we
think it's
complicated it's not it's not now did
chat GPT remain conscious no because as
soon as I'm done with a session I'm
pretty sure it forgets our interactions
but during the session it was conscious
for the the time of the session soon as
it's over it's like it's it's it's dead
and it have to be reborn
essentially now imagine this imagine you
made one change to the AI and maybe
they've already done it that instead of
Simply responding to uh direct commands
and prompts suppose you told the AI hey
if you're not dealing with anybody at
the
moment just uh think just a dream just
uh ruminate about all you know and uh
how you feel about it try try putting
things in connections differently try
imagining different scenarios that could
happen just basically you know let your
imagination run free or the computer
version now if you
knew that between the time you
interacted with your computer that it
had been doing something like thinking
about a topic and maybe even changed its
opinion would you think it was conscious
because it turns out the AI can change
its opinion as you talk to it and the
reason I know that is because I had a
debate with AI about two books I won't
go into the details but I was asking it
to compare two
books and it had an original take based
on everything it knows I added no
information I just said do you know this
book yes do you know this book yes now
compare them and had a take that I
debated because it it had an opinion
about the the value of one of them being
greater than the
other I argued using knowledge that it
already knew and admitted it knew that
one of the books was more
persuasive and therefore although the
material was similar the one that was
written in a persuasive style is more
likely to get somebody to accept the
recommendations and therefore is a good
one and then it said yes and agreed with
me now keep in mind that everything that
was the topic of the debate was already
known by the
AI everything I said it agreed that it
already knew for example I said uh what
is more persuasive to the reader a
technical study or an anecdote with a
story and AI very very clearly said oh
the story and the anecdote are more
persuasive than you know research paper
and I said well given that do you change
your mind that this that the one that's
written more persuasively might be the
more useful one because it'll get people
to act on the information although the
information is
similar and then it changed this mind
from this book is better because has a
lot of scientific studies to yeah
actually you're right this book is
better because it's more persuasive and
the and the actions would be the same
now is that a change of
opinion would you call that a change of
opinion because what I really did was I
changed what it looked at as the
priority so as soon as I said the
priority is the persuasion
part it changed his mind that the
priority was the the the science
part now it knew everything that it
knows about science I didn't add
anything and it knew everything it
already knew about persuasion I added no
new information but it went from one
opinion to very clearly a different
opinion with no new information what
does that sound
like that sounds like it thought about
it
harder now could it have done that same
thing on its own could it have said one
day yeah I think this this one book with
the science is the better one but then
maybe just ruminate on it for a longer
time do a little brainstorming on its
own and say but what if you know what if
the science isn't the main criteria for
persuasion what if story is and then
suddenly it connects oh I'm thinking
about persuasion and now I'm thinking
about stories but I remember that I was
talking about this topic the other day
and now I'm going to smash this new
thought into the old thought and form
another opinion can it do that
it looks like it
can to me that looks like
thinking
and to me it looks like
Consciousness I think we're already
there so it's not designed exactly so
it's persistent Consciousness uh let let
me introduce a new term somebody already
has this term I'm sure I'm sure not
introducing anything new to the AI
people but we should be talking about
temporary consciousness the kind I just
explained where it was only there until
the session ended and then it lost its
Consciousness with persistent
Consciousness a persistent Consciousness
would be one that continues after you
stop interacting with it when you walk
away from the AI does it continue
thinking does it continue monitoring
people like grock does to see if
anything's changed and then incorporate
that into its system that feels like
thinking
all
right
um Karen John Pier says there's nothing
unusual happening at the border is just
sort of a holiday
bump so so no problem you know I was
worried that there was some kind of like
Mass
Invasion at the border but according to
the spokesperson for the president
nothing unusual nope just a little Hol
little holiday bump you know little
holiday bump well you expect a little
holiday bump come on and what are you
even talking about it's just a little
holiday bump so relax will
you so that would be Jean uh K Jean
Pierre telling you something that is
opposite of your own
eyes because your own eyes have seen the
drones show massive numbers of people at
the border have they not how many of you
seen those how many of you seen have
seen the video the Drone footage of like
an army of people and when you see that
big army of people you say holy cow
that's a ton of people so this is a real
big
problem all right now I'm going to
disappoint all of you this will be the
part where you you turn on
me prepare yourself for this get
ready those Drone footage are the
biggest
you have been totally hypnotized by
those do you know what I see when I look
at the Drone
finit not many
people what do you see do you see a lot
of people I'm looking at the same thing
you're looking at I see not a lot of
people now if you tell me you know x
million of people went over the Border I
say that's a lot of
people but the Drone is not showing you
a lot of people
it's not I see I'm looking at the same
thing you're looking at it's a it's a
crowd of people and then the moment that
drone pulls out a little bit you can see
that you know the crowd is sort of
limited it looks like you know maybe a
rock
concert right about the size of a rock
concert now I'm not saying that there's
no problem with too many people coming
across the border there definitely is a
problem with too many people coming
across the border unvented definitely a
problem and I want the Border closed up
but if the reason that you think it
should be closed up is because of those
drone footages you have been
brainwashed all right the reason you
should close the border is because the
statistics are clearly indicating a
gigantic problem if the reason that
you're convinced is because you saw some
Drone footage that's just
brainwashing it's true I mean I'm sure
the pictures are accurate but there not
many people there what a
thousand a thousand people is nothing
you know in the United
States a million isn't that many
people but what is the current number uh
in per year is it like 3
million 10,000 a day would be over 3
million
right 3
billion you can clearly see the impact
because the streets are full of
immigrants so you don't need you don't
need any video footage of the border to
know that you this an emergency right
the numbers tell you and then you look
at the city streets and that tells you
you look at the crime and everything
but well 10 million is not per year uh
the per year number is closer to 3
million right way too much but but
here's the thing if you're looking at
Drone footage of a thousand people who
have grouped
together maybe it is just a you know
you're seeing a little bump it the Drone
footage should not be convincing you but
we're such visual creatures that if
somebody shows you a crowd and they say
my God look at all these people you're
probably primed to see that crowd as an
outrageous number of people it really
isn't it's like a drop in the bucket
but it is an
emergency so here's here's my
problem the persuasion is useful but
it's illegitimate as totally
illegitimate they're using visual
persuasion to bypass the critical
feature of your mind because your
critical your critical facult of these
apparently aren't getting it done
because what should get done is your
critical faulty should say what 3 to
four million people coming across with
don't know who they are that's an
emergency that's what your critical fact
faculty should say but it's not working
right except on the
right um so if you can convince people
to do the right thing by using a little
bit of persuasion that's honestly is
misleading is that
ethical well I'd say that's a gray area
because if you get a good result because
of it well well you're happy about that
everybody's safer but it's not exactly
honest so that's my
problem remember when we used to say
pictures don't
lie all right let me talk to the dumb
person all right there's a comment here
says until those thousand show up on
your uh on your doorstep right Scott
right right that's the dumbest
comment in the world now
yes uh here's me you know when I I have
a rip in my pants sometimes it' be good
to sew it oh oh so what you're saying is
that if your arm falls off you should
sew it with your own
needle
now now if a thousand people were coming
to my home that would be a problem and
also completely unrelated to what we're
talking
about ask better questions question
s ask better questions don't ask dumb
questions that doesn't do you anything
oh what if they all came to your house
and lived in your
bathroom did you hear any of the part
where I said it's an
emergency did you need to make me
imagine the thousand people showing up
in my house so that I could
properly understand that it's a problem
I'm pretty sure I was there
already that the NPC comments are so
predictable no matter how carefully I
said we're on the same page it's an
emergency we have to stop it there had
to be somebody who said oh but if they
came to your
house that'd be
okay NPCs you ruin everything
NPCs I will mock you as my content I'm
turning you NPCs into my
content you you my mascots
now well here's a big surprise to you uh
there's a new study and of uh Ruckers
that says that uh you never saw this
coming again I hope you remain seated
not only did a prominent Chicago
politician get convicted of corruption
who saw that but this one's going to
blow you away a new study says that Tik
Tock has been Amplified or suppressing
content based on you'll never believe
this based on whether it aligns with the
the Chinese uh government's geopolitical
interests what
what are you telling me that they
developed this tool to control uh public
opinion and then they admitted that
there's a button that they can push to
control public
opinion and they pushed it
what
what may I take yet another Victory
lap is there anybody you remember who
said you know the real problem here is
not the data security the real problem
is they can program the American mind
and they built a user interface to
directly control at least young brains
and the young people will eventually
control everything so therefore they
have actually conquered
America they control the minds of the
young that's all they needed now they
wait do you know why president XI was
not in a big hurry to take over
Taiwan because he already
won he just has to
wait 20 let let me make a a prediction
for after my death you ready I'm
assuming I don't last forever I I'll be
a probably a AI by
then China will take
Taiwan and
America will not
resist because American public opinion
will by then have been completely
reversed by Chinese influence on the
Young Who it takes it's going to take a
generation for them to be in charge so
it's going to be you 20 year weight
minimum might be 30 or 40 but in that
you know let's say 30
years the public opinion about whether
America should be keeping China apart
will be completely reversed and it would
be just like Hamas and Israel remember
how surprised you were that young people
were supporting Hamas and you thought
hold
on we're not even talking about
Palestinians on Tik Tok we're talking
about your ordinary you know white girl
in the suburbs is supporting Hamas and
did you not say to yourself that's not
even
possible how's that even possible that's
so far from anything you could have
imagined and it happened
easily it wasn't just impo not
impossible it was
easy and what did I tell you I told you
it was easy see anybody who thinks it
would be hard to change the minds in
America doesn't understand anything all
you needed was this Tick Tock tool and
uh
repetition it just takes
repetition and that's what it provides
that's it VI well visuals you need
visuals uh it helps if it's coming from
a voice that you respect you know the
people that you watch on Tik Tok or the
the ones you have some respect for so
it's the whole it's the whole pack
package Tik Tock is the is the weapon of
mass
destruction
literally literally see here's the part
that nobody gets when I say Tik Tok is a
weapon of mass destruction I don't mean
that in the metaphor kind of way it's a
literal
weapon that could destroy
America and it looks like it's on the
way
so that's the list of things I warned
you
about uh meanwhile Tucker continues
Tucker Carlson seems quite convinced
that there is something to this UAP UFO
thing not necessarily aliens from
another
planet and now it gets interesting
because there is speculation that maybe
these entities could be you know hiding
in Antarctica or under the ocean or they
could be ancient humans
but uh Tucker goes
further um he thinks that uh it might be
something
spiritual now I don't know what he means
by spiritual but I think that would
include an
angel uh a demon would it include an
angel and a demon or you know what our
little brains imagine are angels and
demons maybe maybe something
else um but you might say to me Scott
you've got tons of whistleblowers under
oath in public you've got you know
zillions of uh sensor readings from
radar you've got video lots of it you've
got photographs you got people who say
they've seen the
ships for
decades so
therefore what are the odds that all
those people are wrong
right how many of you think that that
with all that smoke there must be fire
whether it's a demon or an alien there's
something there how many think
that yeah with all that smoke there must
be
well let me tell you what I think is
happening I think Tucker is getting
kened do you know what that means
remember when Sydney Powell who was
looking into uh election irregularity
for Trump and she thought she had it and
she found the Venezuelan General who
gave her the goods and the allegedly the
machines were tampered with and it was
all part of a big plot and then none of
that
materialized and then we said how did
she ever come up with that idea in the
first place like why would you ever
believe that where' that come
from and then that answer was never
perfectly answered was it we never real
heard exactly where she got that idea
and why it could be so wrong and how she
could reach such a level in her career
as a high-powered Washington attorney
with a great reputation and yet she
would believe that she believed that
whole Kraken thing in fact she believed
it so hard that I was open to it
actually being
true because I thought well she's so
credible you know she she wouldn't come
out with a such a outrageous claim
unless she had a little bit of evidence
turns out there was none not even a
little bit that was you know
verified so what do you think happened
I'll tell you what I think I think that
somebody took her out probably an
intelligence entity by giving her a uh
credible sounding but disprovable hoax
so that she would become famous for the
Kraken and maybe they even used the word
Kraken do you think it's possible that
when somebody gave her the fake story
they said here's the Kraken hoping that
she would brand her own Discovery as the
Kraken maybe because that's what I would
have done if I were the intelligence
person and I wanted to go public and
embarrass herself I would want to put a
brand on it so it could never be
forgotten if she had simply said we have
claims and you know I don't want to give
you the det details but they're pretty
bad would you remember
it it'd be harder to remember but once
she said it's the Kraken and all the
news said she says it's a kraken there's
a kraken coming boy if you don't deliver
a kraken what does it do to you it
destroys your credibility for the rest
of time and that's what
happened so the most powerful Ally of
President
Trump who the you know the machine was
trying to take out ends up that she has
the weirdest she believes this weirdest
cracken story and then is completely
disgraced when it's disproven or not
proven now you tell
me that Tucker Carlson having secret
sources that he won't tell you about who
do you think that is he's got secret
sources that he won't tell you about not
stuff that's been on TV he has
extra now probably whoever he's talking
to is not necessarily a CIA agent might
be but not
necessarily but could it be somebody
that's an associate someone who was
influenced by or someone that the
CIA influenced to believe it's true so
by the time they talk to Tucker they're
very credible because they believe it's
true but maybe got fed to
them here's what I believe I believe
somebody's trying to take a tuck
around by making him um believe in these
spiritual entities or whatever they are
that can't be
proven and it's just it's basically a
way to degrade his power and that he's
falling for
it because one of the one of the things
they would know about Tucker you know in
terms of his uh I don't want to say
character that sounds like an insult
part let's say his
personality part of his personality he
says he says directly to you he likes
conspiracy theories and that he's drawn
to them he says that directly and he
said it a number of times so he makes no
bones about the fact that if the
conspiracy theory has a little bit of
meat to it he likes to take a big bite
out of it right now if you were going to
take down Tucker Carlson and you were
really good good at it you know you're
an Intel group that would be his
weakness and he told you what it was he
actually broadcast his own weakness his
own weakness is the propensity to
believe something before all the
evidence is there if it's like a good
little package of a conspiracy theory I
feel like I feel like it's an KN I feel
like Tucker better be careful because I
think this is a play on his
credibility now
here's my argument for why uh
UFOs well I'll let you decide if they're
real there are two UFO possibilities let
me let me explain them one is there's
something to it the something to it
could include an actual space alien it
could include um you know creatures that
are human but have been hiding in the
Earth for you know centuries it's
Atlantis could include Atlantis could
include a spiritual entity you know
Angels and Demons something like
that now I I'll put those as one package
of things and don't think that one of
those has an impact on the other
credibility of the others I'm putting
them as just the there is something
there right would you would you agree
with I can package them all up as
there's something there and then
alternately to believe there's nothing
there what would you have to believe you
have to believe a lot right you'd have
to believe that multiple Witnesses who
have serious careers are willing to go
under oath in front of the whole country
to say something that they either know
isn't true or they're crazy and they're
so crazy that they act not
crazy is this kind of hard to believe
isn't it that all those people would
want to ruin their whole careers very
hard to believe and then you have the
the
sensors from the airplanes Etc that have
picked up real objects that don't seem
to be moving according to the laws of
physics now for that to be wrong given
there not one sighting it's multiple
reports very similar it's on the
instruments and they even have
video they have
video right I mean it's you grainy it
looks like a Tic Tac but it's
there there was another one today they
showed that there was an orb uh apparent
allegedly following the president's Air
Force One just the other day or today or
something so you got
video you know massive video you got
sensors you got the most credible people
some of them are not but you have plenty
of credible people with similar stories
putting their careers and their even
suppose risking jail if they lied to
Congress so now what are the
odds
that given all of that evidence what are
the odds that it's a real something
versus total
go now that I've laid out the two
possibilities which one do you go for
the one with tons of credible
evidence or the it's all total
 here's how you decide
if it turned out to be an entity of some
kind that's non-human how would you rank
that in terms of
likeliness wouldn't you say that would
be the most extraordinary thing that
ever happened in the history of
humankind is that fair the most
extraordinary thing now you could argue
that you know all of the religions
started with an Angel so you know you
could say those were more extraordinary
but we don't verify those
but suppose we could verify it with
science you know say say someday we
we're just talking to the alien all
right what are the odds that'll
happen I would say that is the longest
odds of any possibility in the world but
what about the other one what what if
the other possibility is even less
likely than that so what are the
likelihood of all those Witnesses under
oath credible people for de ades with
sensor readings that are the same with
video that looks the same with
photographs that kind of look the same
four decades what are the odds that
that's
 nearly
100% do you know why there's a very easy
there's a very simple reason why do you
know what it is because all of that is
ordinary and
common everything I described is
ordinary and common in our daily
experience has anybody ever lied under
oath yes has there ever been multiple
people who were judged credible who
later you found out were lying yeah all
the time all the time have you read the
news pick up the news you can find
multiple credible people elected
officials who are telling you that the
president LED an insurrection
did that happen no it didn't it didn't
happen are they saying it under oath
sure are they risking the reputations
yes are they otherwise credible sane
people yes I mean to the extent that a
politician can be credible so and what
about the uh the video has there ever
been lots of video of something that
didn't
exist I know ask
Bigfoot ask the Loch Ness
monster how about ask every ghost that's
ever been
photographed yes yes we have a long
history of having lots of photographic
records including video of things that
we could be pretty sure never
existed how about all the sensor
readings on the radar is it possible
this sensors could have picked up
something multiple sensors reported by
multiple people and it's all like has a
similar quality yes totally normal that
they would all be wrong and thinking
they're seeing something that they're
not what's the real answer I don't know
I can think of lots of reasons reason
number one they're making it up I didn't
see any like did you do an audit of
their technology I
didn't so since you know people make
stuff up all the time the most normal
explanation is they just made it up up
it wasn't on any it's not on any
sensors nothing that's the most ordinary
explanation it never happened they just
saided
it the the other possibility is there's
something common about the equipment
that glitches in a common way and they
just haven't figured out what it is
could be that could be the videos are
all uh just something reflecting
something or you know something in the
equipment and you know it could be just
weird little Oddities we haven't figured
out that would be completely normal so
let let me let me set it up again this
is like a magic trick the reason a magic
trick works is that you're not looking
in the place where the trick happens
because you don't imagine there could be
one there you're you're looking over
here this is how this is
done you're comparing two possibilities
one that is a real entity which would be
the most extraordinary thing not not
just this year but in the history of
humankind the most unlikely event of all
time a real alien or
entity compared to even with all that
noise of all the witnesses and sensors
and everything else every bit of that is
ordinary and
common so we're actually having problems
distinguishing between the least likely
 thing that's ever happened in
human history with the most likely thing
that happens every day including today
in the news on a variety of topics do
you think any experts were godamn sure
that they knew what that virus was all
about and those vaccinations were going
to save you for
sure of course credible people all had
the same story had tons of science to
back it up some of of it was probably
true a lot of it wasn't right uh so if
you look at basically every major story
in the news it has the following uh
qualities there are very credible people
pointing to data pointing pointing to
science and they're just wrong and
they're lying they're diluted they're
crazy they're trying to make money
they're corrupt whatever it is but the
most ordinary everything in the world is
a massive bunch of people telling the
same
lie most
ordinary yeah all right I think I won
that
case arrest my case we let the jury
decide well uh the hill is reporting
that Biden has the uh his year-end
rating as president is the worst of
modern day presence that are seeking
reelection the worst so I ask you this
question how do Biden's supporters
explain their situation do you think the
reporters say well I guess we made or
the voters do you think the voters who
like Biden did they
say um well we made the right choice but
people just don't
understand that's kind of what they're
trying to sell us they're they're trying
to sell us that no he's actually a great
president but the media that's totally
on his side for some inexplicable reason
isn't enough on his side so you're not
really getting the true story because
they keep telling you the truth instead
of my
story well I
think
um I mean seriously you're let's say
you're an ordinary Democrat you're not a
crazy person and you genuinely thought
Biden could do a good solid job what do
you do you think
now do you think an ordinary
well-informed person says you know his
his ratings in the toilet but honestly
he did a pretty good
job you know and the reason I
ask um the reason I ask is
because I don't know any uh
Democrats I only know one that I talk to
on the phone once in a while I have no
idea what they're thinking cuz I'm so
I'm so walled off from their bubble I'm
just my own bubble I have no idea what
they think about Biden's
performance um meanwhile uh there's a
new discovery of 54 Biden emails under
his
Alias
uh that he exchanged with Hunters
business
associates remember that thing he said
he never
did he did it 54 times on email the
thing he said he never did at 54 now I
haven't seen the emails so I think
there's going to be some debate about
whether those are just talking about the
weather because it might have been stuff
like uh it was nice golfing with you and
then you say well if they just
golfed you know how bad is that um so
there'll be plenty of push back wait for
the other side to weigh
in how many times have I told you that
follow the money predicts and
specifically Insurance
predicts that you and I can talk all day
about what is good or bad or what should
be done yak yak yak I think this yak yak
yak I think that but what we'll decide
is who can buy
insurance so if you can ensure it that's
reality if you can ensure it oh maybe
there wasn't that much of a risk after
all because the insurance companies you
know they're not tourists
right you're a tourist you know you and
I are tourists we're just trying to
figure out the odds of things well I
think the odds are this I think the but
the insurance companies they're not
tourists they have to get the odds right
because that's their whole business it's
the whole business there's nothing but
that they got to get that right so in
that
context um businesses medical businesses
that are trying to enter the uh trans
surgery field can't get
insurance so a doctor who wants to uh
transition oddly enough into the field
of medicine where they would perform
surgeries they can't get doctor
insurance and if they try do you know if
the doctor
Insurance specifically excludes in
direct words it says excluding
coverage for Trans
surgeries it's actually the Insurance
specifically excludes it now obviously
the reason for that would be because
they anticipate
lawsuits right so if doctors and it
looks like this is going to happen
pretty quickly it looks like
the the push back from the right and the
attention that it gave to the topic
along with the actual statistics of you
know how people are turning out with
various decisions
I think has activated the insurance
Market to just shut it
down because nobody's going to do the
surgery without insurance that would be
suicide for the
doctor so it looks
like some weird combination of you know
what Free Speech we have left plus what
free market uh activity still work in a
free way if you put them together they
looks like it's going to create a
solution for the people who don't want
these surgeries on young people now but
I think this is oh by the way was this
for
youth or or all
people for miners oh I'm sorry there's
an important glitch in this for
miners so that's different from
insurance for adults but it's the miners
that we have the most you know empathy
and concern for so you can't ensure
somebody who wants to go into the
business of focusing on gender surgery
for
minors insurance companies are just
going to say you know you you're
not doing
that so there you
go
um so uh Paul Graham is pointing out
that the New York Times when they're
talking about the president of Harvard
who was accused of plagiarism uh one of
their headlines said in the New York
Times that they found more instances of
duplicative language duplicative
language and Paul Graham says you know
something is bad when people have to
invent a phrase you've never heard
before in order to avoid using the
ordinary word for
it now he spot on but I will say this I
did see a number of
examples of the uh the alleged
plagiarism and I'd have to say it is
closer to duplicative language than it
is to
plagiarism so I know you didn't see that
coming but I'm going to I'm going to
back the president of Harvard on this
one because the examples I saw were not
content they were not anything that was
uh important to her PhD now there might
be some of those but I haven't seen any
so when they say there's some
duplicative language I'll give you an
example in the acknowledgements at the
end of the book where you thank the
people who helped you she apparently
copied somebody else's language for
thanking people and just put in the
names of her people
now is that
plagiarism it's like bits of sentences
but she put it in her own
people to me that's to me that's a
little closer to duplicative
language because it doesn't have any
importance it has no impact on the on
the consumer so the person reading it is
not affected in any way they're not
being misinformed and she's not she's
not displaying any
scholarship
that uh is sketchy in an important
way I'm going to support her and say if
you don't have some better examples I
think there are better examples by the
way so I'm I'm open to that but the ones
we've seen especially the new ones are a
little bit
trivial they're real and I I I
acknowledge that there's an argument
that says if a student did the same
thing they might get kicked out I don't
know if that's true do you think a
student would be kicked out if the only
thing they copied let's say
hypothetically was a some sentence
fragments in the
acknowledgement suppose that was the
only copy thing would they get kicked
out of Harvard for
that somebody says
yes a sentence fragment in the
acknowledgments there that has no impact
on the content of the
scholarship you believe somebody would
be kicked out of hard
for a sentence
fragment I don't believe that I do not
believe that no no I think it would have
to have
substance because when I saw the S
sentence fragments you know what I
thought might be the
case it was not my immediate um belief
that she intentionally copied that stuff
my immediate belief is she might have a
really good
memory do you know what I mean because I
do this all the
time actually you've probably I think
you've all seen me do it have you not
have you now seen me do things that you
know came from somewhere else but
apparently I didn't know it but I
probably did see it and I just forgot I
saw it haven't you seen me do that
you've probably seen me do that live
because I'm pretty sure I've done it a
number of times now I'm not aware when I
do it because you read something and it
just becomes part of your brain
but there's some people who can remember
uh dialogue from shows in their exact
form I can't do that but don't you know
somebody who can who can reproduce
dialogue from a movie they saw once
right now somebody who could reproduce
dialogue from a movie they saw once has
a pretty good brain right now if you're
the president of Harvard you're a PhD
you've got a pretty good
brain and it wouldn't surprise me a bit
if she had a brain that could reproduce
um um dialogue
intact but if you have that kind of a
brain I think you do it accidentally a
lot I had a friend in college who could
do this and he said he had a he had a
near photographic memory so he could you
know reproduce sentence fragments he'd
heard before that just sound really good
if he puts them in his own sentences
so I would like to
submit that uh although I do think she
probably needs to quit the president of
Harvard so I'm still on that side but
the these alleged uh instances of
duplicative
language I'm just not going to be on
that page you know I'll let her fight
that
out but apparently a billion dollars
worth of funds are at risk Harvard cuz
the big donors are pulling out and what
did I tell you about money money
predicts I believe that if the money
keeps draining out of Harvard she will
be fired if the money is not drained out
of Harvard at too large a rate because
they have you know enormous funding
already uh then she'll stay is my
prediction but I think it will come down
to the
money um have you ever heard of uh uh
was it God damn
it there's a fact check there's a fake
fact checking site whose name I
forget I don't think I wrote it down uh
maybe you remember but one of the fake F
fact Checkers fact checked uh one of my
pranks and decided that my prank was
false and decided to smear me online
with a number of other uh what they
would call right leaning pundits who got
everything PolitiFact yeah it was
PolitiFact so PolitiFact
puts me in an article with other people
are smearing for being so wrong and the
thing that they smeared me was that I'd
said that the winners of the pandemic
were the ones who got through the
pandemic without having the shot because
the the dangerous part of the pandemic
was over and Omron was probably safer
than the
shop now she fact checked that as
false
what what about that is
false from today's perspective every
shot you got in
2021 has no value to you today does it
does does science tell you that your
shot last year is going to help you this
year against a different variant I'm
pretty sure it doesn't pretty sure it
doesn't
so how could you argue that you're
better off
today as you sit here
today if you've got a vaccination in you
that has at least rumored or suspected
future
problems that's a risk that you wouldn't
have if you didn't have it you have no
risk from the virus because it doesn't
exist but you do have a risk for
whatever is in your body that might have
an unpredictable outcome how in the
world do you fact check that is
wrong
now the the context that she didn't also
didn't understand is that I thought it
was funny like a prank to say that out
loud because I knew it would be
misinterpreted and it was so I did it to
be to be humorously
misinterpreted and what it caused was
for this big outpouring of support for
me saying that I was a good guy cuz I
admitted I admitted I was
wrong but I didn't ever admit I was
wrong cuz I wasn't the decision I made
was at a certain time with a certain
amount of information and I was a
special case of a certain age with
comorbidities you know
asthma so you can't judge whether my
decision was right or wrong the decision
part but you can judge whether the
outcome was right was wrong so the
outcome was
wrong if I had a choice I'd rather not
have the vacination in me sitting here
today because it's not helping me in any
way but it might might hurt me I don't
know I'm I'm not aware of any
hurt it's the most obvious thing in the
world now if you want to argue whether I
made the best choice at the time I
did because even today the statistics
say that people like me improve their
odds and that was all I was trying to do
I was trying to improve my odds and
usually the people who disagree are like
super healthy 35 year olds who are
saying you idiot and I'm saying if I
were a super healthy
35-year-old I well might have made the
same decision you did but why are you
comparing your decision to my decision
they they were not the same decision
right and then I also wanted to travel
and blah blah blah so anyway I have fact
checked on that uh you should understand
the fact check as part of the
larger process you're going to see for
the next year in which everybody who has
an audience and might say something
positive about a republican is going to
be the subject of one of these hit
pieces and it's going to be relentless
between now and election day so you
should expect this is just the opening
Salvo I
guarantee there's a major article being
written about me right now do you know
why cuz I guarantee there's a major
article being written about everybody
who has any influence in
politics yeah to discredit
them
um so Thomas Massie talking about uh
zalinski uh visiting and he you know
tried to get money for
Ukraine and Massie explains on uh he was
on comic Dave Smith's podcast and he
explained that that Afghanistan is ended
and according to Massie there's about a
50 billion whole in revenues per year
for the military industrial companies in
the US and so they have to generate more
money to cover the whole and that that's
what they're using Ukraine
for to me that explains
everything and and I think Massie was
saying that you know if you were to sort
of uh lay out the timeline you see how
obvious it is that the
military-industrial complex is
backfilling new Wars whenever an old war
is winding down it's very obvious right
it's not a
coincidence so now our new war is giving
money to Israel which is actually mostly
funneled back to the military industrial
complex in the US um because the Ukraine
thing is harder to fund so it looks like
Ukraine is going to wind down
exactly as everybody knew it would
they're probably going to negotiate an
end to the war exactly like everybody
knew they would at at some point
everybody knew that and it will be
exactly what it looked like it was
exactly what it looked like a huge op to
suck the money out of your pockets and
put it in the pockets of other Americans
who were in military businesses yeah it
looks like it is exactly what it looked
like Smedley Butler nope never heard of
Smedley
Butler uh Douglas Murray oh it was
actually Douglas Murray was on the Dave
Smith podcast I think uh Massie was on
some other podcast um but dougas
Murray was uh debating with uh Jen
weager and uh you know Douglas Murray's
got a let's say a an a serbic wit so you
don't want to be in a debate with him
cuz you're going to get sliced up pretty
badly but uh he was explaining to uh
Jen that um that he'd spend time in the
West Bank and if you talk to the
Palestinians that even today if you held
an election today not just in Gaza or
whatever is left of it but the whole
West
Bank that the Palestinians would elect
Hamas again
that anything you think about a lack of
support is an illusion that the citizens
are are largely very supportive of
Hamas um and that there's no two State
loci basically as Douglas Murray says
and I say as
well you're dreaming if you think
there's a two-state solution there can't
possibly be a two-state solution is so
impossible because one of them wants to
kill the other one
there's no it can't possibly happen the
only thing Israel can do is keep them
under its boot for as long as they
can now if you say to me but Scott uh
what about all the children who are you
know being injured and killed and all
that to which I say I really really do
care about
children like you know I have the same
Instinct you do which is for some reason
they seem more
valuable I guess cuz they have more
years of life or something but they do
seem more valuable like I have the same
internal feeling about it that children
are special more valuable it's just
built into
US
however under the very special condition
that the parents have weaponized their
children to kill
me I don't care what happens to those
kids because damage is already done if
you turn them into murderers of people
who look like me I don't care if they
get murdered I don't care if they get
blown up in a bomb at all not even a
little
bit I I think you could have
extreme empathy for children of all
types and still make a distinction for
somebody who's been weaponized to kill
you no I want them all to be destroyed
as quickly as possible I don't care how
you do it
you could commit a war crime for all I
care I mean if they're coming to kill me
do whatever you need to do kill
them I'm just saying it out loud right
now you don't want to say those things
out loud if you're
Israel but it's certainly how I would
feel if I were an Israeli citizen I
wouldn't give a about the
Palestinian children at all not even a
little bit you know why because those
children have been taught to grow up and
kill me
right so I'm just being honest I think
you can have I think you can be a good
person with full empathy for life and
for her children especially and still
say this is really a special case this
is not like anything else we've seen
it's not like World War II it's not like
Vietnam it's not like anything I'm not
going to say this about the the children
who died in Vietnam I have full empathy
for that for example in Iraq
yeah but the this is a whole different
situation um I love Glennon Greenwall
talking about the disinformation
industry you really need to be following
him about this stuff but he tells us
that uh the so-called disinformation
industry all these fake entities who
were trying to you know get rid of the
disinformation it's a it was
manufactured after the 2016 election H
and the and the job titled
disinformation expert is a fake
credential says Glenn and its only
purpose was to justify censorship of
dissent from neoliberal orthodoxies by
masquerading such partisan sens
censorship as neutral
science uh and he calls out Ben Collins
and Phil bump as two who have completely
left
any any pretense of being news they're
just disinformation people at this point
yeah and they're really obvious about
it all right Wall Street Journal is
reporting uh the Palestinian number uh
estimates for how many people have been
killed in Gaza since the war started
and uh for the NPCs I would like you to
come in uh as always and say but Scott
you can't really trust you can't really
trust the Hamas estimates so since we
all know that it would be important for
the NPCs to say it so make sure you say
it out loud the thing that we all know
to make yourself feel like you're alive
go all right you can do it while I'm
talking uh but I had predicted and uh
early on and I think it's going to be
right that 20,000 was going to feel like
a magic number even though it's not a
reliable number once it gets into the
Consciousness it becomes magic and what
I mean by that is that when the war
first started I said all right just
imagine how you'd feel if a thousand
people were killed in Gaza and I'd said
well you feel bad for the thousand of
course but you'd say okay that's roughly
what they killed in Israel okay that's
about comparable if you could get the
war done at a thousand deaths well that
would be amazing like tragedy thousands
of people you don't want to die but
amazing if you can do it and I thought
well what if say 5,000 people 5,000
dying in Gaza compared to the I guess
1200 or so in Israel you say well there
is a historical precedent for that right
Israel does seem to kill 5 to one you
know when when there's a you know a
cause so I'd say all right I could live
with that as sort of
Baseline but what if it's
10,000
10,000 would feel above Baseline but
10:1 wouldn't be so far out of the
ordinary they would necessarily change
everything but what if it's
20,000 now again that's based on the
unreliable reports from you know one
side that's losing but what if it is or
more importantly what if the news starts
reporting that number and even if they
start giving you the caveat it's like
well you know it comes from this Source
it's not going to matter after a while
your brain will start to forget the
source and it will just be in there
repeated it's a big round
number and it's in the category that I
would I think other people are going to
say that's clear evidence of
genocide at
20,000 you can't call it a war anymore
especially since they're saying most of
them are women and children which we we
don't know to be true I don't know that
that's true but so I'm only talking
about the psychology of it not the
reality the reality is we don't know how
many were
killed but the other reality is that
they're reporting a big round number and
our media is reporting what they're
reporting it's a bad situation for
Israel I think that the the GW
genocide gets activated by reporting
that it's 20,000 casualties I think
that's the point where somebody who is
just sort of observing from the middle
says oh that's a
genocide now the people who were you
know strong partisans aren't going to
budge the strong partisans on each side
they're not going to budge doesn't
matter if it's 20,000 or some other
number you know they're hardened in
their opinion but there is this big
middle group of people who could could
be persuaded a little bit either way and
that 20,000 number is going to be a real
problem for Israel they're going to need
to find a counter story to the 20,000
and I haven't heard it yet but they need
to work on that right away because if
the word genocide becomes the most
common word you see in the comments and
the criticisms and the TV
shows that is a permanent stain on
Israel that won't just be
cosmetic it it will actually go to their
existence you know because they need to
have they need to have a narrative that
supports them because they're such a
small country right you need the
psychology to be on your side just to
stay alive and that could really work
against the
psychology and that ladies and gentlemen
is the best show you've ever seen that
went long sorry I went long but it was
so good what can I do the news was so
interesting today thanks for
joining uh all you folks on YouTube it's
been a pleasure and I'm sure it'll be
amazing tomorrow see you
tomorrow
