well we've got every possible technical
problem you could ever have
today I've entered my password 400 times
just this morning
alone but damn it I'm going to make it
all work oh I think I just broke
it all right people stream on in here I
couldn't print my notes
today I think I had unsolvable problems
on four devices and 15 applications
already this morning all
unsolvable and they all hit at the same
time but despite all that there's going
to be something like a show that
happens once I close my blinds and get
my lighting
right yep I got a brick for a computer I
got a brick for
here good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's not looking so good at
the moment but I think it's going to get
better all the time and if you'd like to
take your experience up to levels that
nobody can even understand with their
tiny smooth human brains all you need is
a gerer micro glass a tanker chel Stein
a canteen sugar flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and
happens
now Ah that's some good
stuff good stuff right
there well I've got a
theme I've got the most annoying
technical setup of all time I'm looking
at myself twice except they're not
running at the same
speed so so I've got me in real time
over here here but me delayed over there
so I'm watching Scott Galloway on one
and Scott Adams on the other anyway but
enough about me so here's a story the
former Israeli defense minister liberman
he says Iran is planning a nuclear
Holocaust for the Jewish state in the
next two years it's going to be a war of
extermination he says we're in the midst
of an Iranian extermination
program has anybody used that word
recently for the uh the situation in
Gaza and and Israel in
general
extermination
well that is a key Concept in my new
book which is God's debris plus the
religion War plus a brand new short
story um you you're going to be somewhat
blown away when you when you read the
middle book that's in the trilogy is
book the religion War cuz it's literally
built around the plot of an
extermination PL
plan so I haven't really seen that in
the real world but I predicted it 20
years ago and here we are there we're
actually using the words extermination
as like a a literal thing that people
are worried might
happen all right uh the book is doing
great by the way if you haven't if you
haven't ordered your copy I think there
might still be that glitch that says
it's not available the cover is not
available to December but that's not
real you go ahead and order it if you
get that message it's not real it will
be
corrected um we looked into the source
of the problem on Amazon why does it say
December when it's available now and uh
answer we got back from the publisher is
um you know sometimes things happen it
might take a
while we're in the midst of the greatest
incompetent crisis of all time have you
tried to do
anything recently you can't do anything
nothing
works well the Greenland ice sheet is at
risk say the climate
scientists um and you know there's a
story about they measuring it again and
blah blah blah Greenland ice sheet and
if it melts were all dead and blah blah
blah BL blah I I've come to the decision
that if there's uh one thing I don't
trust in the news is anything about
ice that's my new rule if if my
government or my experts try to tell me
anything that they that they know about
ice I I'm just going to say I don't
think you do know that no I think the
world is full of ice and people have
different data on whether it's even
increasing or decreasing we're not even
sure if it's going up or down and you're
going to tell me oh I know uh I've got
some microbes here that might slow down
the you know that that's the story
there's some kind of bacteria or
microbes or some damn thing that they
think can slow down the melting ice and
I say first of all we have no idea what
would really happen if it melted we
don't know if it is melting we don't
know if some other place will get more
ice to
compensate uh if that's even a thing but
I've just decided I'm not going to worry
about ice anymore I feel it feel feels
like very much like ho in the
ozone you know just madeup
stuff that but I have so little trust in
uh anything that involves any of our
experts let's see if I can close this
and reopen it
that I I just don't know what to think
about ice but my my choice will be to
not believe
it all right uh in Atlanta they've got
some big problems with their water mains
they've got this uh old system as many
of the Cities do and apparently had
several different major water brakes and
some people are saying that the cities
are now so old a lot of the
infrastructure is 50 to 100 years old
and it's going to take you know massive
fixing but um I think this is just more
evidence
of we should build new
cities does it really make sense to
replace the water infrastructure in an
existing City just build a new city you
know I I realized we're going to have to
do it obviously but it every time I see
a story like this I just say new city
just just start new fixing all this
stuff that's completely broken you know
here's the here's the situation let's
say you did a great job of fixing the
water supply in
Atlanta when you're done you still have
to live in the city I mean if that's
your thing and work there how about not
living and working in the
city let's figure something else out I I
figur they have to fix it too but run
away um here's another uh just amazing
piece of science um just to renew your
faith in science because a lot of you
are like I'm not sure I trust the
experts after the pandemic but here let
me let me tell you the experts are doing
some good work too so
neuroscientists have figured out that uh
if you're trying to convince somebody of
something such as politics a negative
emotion like fear is more
persuasive okay they did a scientific
study to find if people being afraid
will change their
actions was there even one person on the
planet Earth who is not already aware
that if you're afraid you're going to
act pretty much
immediately does that did anybody not
know
that raise your hand if you didn't know
that fear is a major motivator in the
world didn't know and then it gets
Dumber if you can get any dumber than
that hey we discovered that fear
matters uh They said that the second
biggest mover of people's opinions was
the macroeconomic situation
yes that's completely different from
Fear isn't it right the the notion that
maybe the economy would plunge you into
desperate starvation and
cannibalism they're calling that
different from the worrying about
something that scares you no the economy
is only
fear we're afraid it's going to
disappear we're afraid of inflation
taking all our money it's not two topics
it's one topic
when people are afraid of things they
act including
voting so let's add that to you could
have asked Scott and save some money but
in this case you could have asked
literally any adult do you think this
fear thing really M makes a
difference uh here's one uh again you
know I want you to renew your faith in
science there's a new study that that
says that uh exercise can increase your
sex drive huh well I didn't see that
coming it's almost like I'm starting to
think that exercise is good for
people has anybody picked up on that yet
it's like science is starting to close
in on the idea that exercise and maybe
even eating right and I don't know I'm
just going to guess sleeping getting
enough sleep is it possible that those
things are good for us well thank God
we've got some experts looking into this
yes yes it turns out that if you
exercise it can make you horny it can
also increase your endorphins and your
dopamine and your serotonin and your
testosterone let me
simplify do you know what makes people
horny good
health did they not know
that and exercising is good for your
health so they hadn't quite connected
the dots yet the scientists the experts
huh we know that good health definitely
makes you
horny and we know that exercise causes
good health I wonder I wonder could we
find out a link between exercise and
your
libido yes yes you could have asked me
just ask me next time or ask any adult
who apparently is not a idiot
who's an
expert a necessary
science here's one that's actually
interesting this one actually might be
useful uh some scientists use what they
called pink noise which is somehow they
could monitor the the electrical signals
in your brain and then they would create
some soft uh hissing noise like static
or or an ocean wave that would match the
rhythms of your own natural brain
rhythms redundant
sentence um but you know what I mean and
why would they do that well they tested
and found out that if you did that you
could double people's
memory you could double it yeah in a in
a test of did you remember this did you
remember that they
doubled now there's also um thoughts
that might have some other benefits like
maybe putting you to sleep and stuff but
what does this remind you of
they matched The rhythms in your brain
does that sound like anything you've
heard of they matched the natural rhythm
of your brain it's pacing and
leading is basically anytime you match
anybody's bodily anything you become
more influential and you can program
their brain so this sound might actually
be the user interface for your
brain that they might be able to find
the Rhythm that matches your brain and
it's just going to unlock it you're
going to be able to program it any way
you want now I don't think they figured
that out yet they just figured out it's
good for your memory but oh my God they
might be on the verge of mechanical
hypnosis meaning they would just match
one bodily thing for you your brain that
probably is the most influential part of
the your body that they could match and
then once they' matched it they're just
going to slip in
suggestions do you know why why I think
people's memory
doubled here's a provocative speculative
hypothesis again redundant I'm all about
the redundancies
today I
believe that uh what's happening is that
people became more
suggestible and they knew they were
being tested on their
memory I think you might have been able
to suggest them into doubling their
memory do you know how I would test that
I would test that by having people who
are um easily hypnotizable as a control
group because right now they're
controlling against you know the
Baseline of not doing it I guess but if
you really want to find out what the
mechanism is you want to control against
the Baseline of of
suggestion because people who are being
tested on their memory clearly know
they're being tested on their memory I I
don't know how you could not know it so
so it could be that what the machine did
was match their match them and put them
in a suggestible mode and then they just
said we're going to test your memory and
they thought well they're not going to
test making my memory
worse so they must be testing to see if
it's better so maybe it is so I do think
you could literally suggest people have
a better
memory I think that's the thing you need
to test
it I saw saw a post long thread by David
Roberts on X and he went to a car
dealership and he says y'all I just got
back from a car dealership holy I
thought quote maybe my stereotypes are
outdated maybe it's not so bad anymore
and then he says it's dot dot dot so
much worse I couldn't believe it I and
then he goes on ranting about um he kept
asking questions that they couldn't
answer here are some questions I
couldn't answer what options does it
have and how much does it cost when's it
available
nothing that they couldn't answer any
question about the
vehicle and and the and instead of
saying I don't know they had to leave
and go talk to somebody and they would
be gone for a long
time now my theory is that the whole uh
dealership process of being gone for a
long time you've all experienced this
you go in they say oh yeah I don't know
if I can sell it to you for that I
better talk to my manager now you all
know that they're not talking to their
manager right they might be in the
manager's office but that's not why
they're going there they're going there
to to um to wear you
down the the goal of the dealer is
hypnosis they're they're trying to
hypnotize you and the longer they keep
you there the more control they have
over you because you're getting get
hungry and tired and you're going to
want that car and finally you're
going to say all right I just can't I
can't be here another eight hours okay
yes yes give me the car so every time
they do it you should call them out or
do what I do I bring a laptop and when
they say oh I got to go talk to my boss
I go great I got some work to do anyway
and even if they indicate they're only
going to be going for a minute you take
out your laptop you start some real work
and then you do what you were going to
do anyway while they're with you
and when they come back they see you're
happily working on your laptop they'll
see their trick didn't work because
they're trying to make you really really
unhappy that you're sitting there doing
nothing so don't do
nothing set up a little uh office for
yourself get yourself a nice beverage
sit there with your laptop out and just
say yeah take your
time I got all
day now what I actually recommend is you
don't ever negotiate for a car but you
know the another the other scam and I
hate to tell you so many of you fell for
it how many of you have fell for the
fleet pricing scam or alternate
alternately I bought it online from some
kind of entity that gets a good deal and
then you don't negotiate but you got it
online so they've already negotiated for
you let's say Costco for example or
CarMax or there are a bunch of them
where you can buy online and no
negotiating so so that's good right
because you don't have to worry about
the
price right and and dealerships have
something called a fleet manager and I
remember one time I was so smart oh was
I smart I said I'm not going to go to
the regular manager I'm going to go to
the fleet manager because I know he's
got goals too and I'll say well I'm not
really a fleet but if you could just
sell me the car at the same price that
you sell to the fleet you know a big
company that's buying lots of cars if
you can give me that price no
negotiating cash deal done it'll be the
quickest sale you ever had and it'll be
at a price you're happy with because
it's your own flea
price and then the fleet guy says you
know what I think I can make that work
and you're like yes I am I'm like a
genius wa till I tell everybody about
this I get the greatest Price I get the
flea price the people have negotiated it
down already and it's fast and I get rid
of all that BS of waiting and they give
you the price and you drive
away and you spent way more than you
would have if you spent eight hours
negotiating because the negotiated price
you know they start with the sticker
price that nobody
pays and then if you negotiated you can
get you know quite a bit off of that if
you go in for the flea price they're
going to give you a price that's between
the sticker price that nobody pays so
you shouldn't even be looking at it in
the first place and higher than what you
could have certainly negotiated if you'd
stuck it out so taking the flea price is
accepting a screwing that you didn't
have to accept but you go home feeling
that you won it's the cleverest trick so
if you buy online somewhere and you were
to compare your online price to somebody
bought exactly the same car but they
negotiated all day who do you think is
going to pay an extra ,000
it's probably at least
$1,000 that that you just left on the
table by avoiding the uh
negotiating how many of you didn't know
that how many of you are saying Oh shoot
that's exactly what I did I didn't
realize I wasted $1,000 you didn't waste
it you spent $1,000 not to deal with the
terrible terrible sales so I believe
that Tesla doesn't do any of that I
think they just have one price and
therefore I'm really leaning toward
buying it only for that reason to me
that's the Tipping Point if you can't
get somebody to sell you something and
by the way I added my own story uh that
people doubted all right my own story is
I went to my local Toyota dealer and
said I'd like to buy a truck I had a
pretty good idea what I wanted features
and color you can't do it there's no
mechanism for going in and buying the
truck you want now when I say that you
say come on that obviously that's a
that's a little bit of hyperbole right
there it's a truck selling place
obviously other people have trucks Scott
I see them all over the place so
obviously you can go to a dealer you can
buy a truck can
you can you have you tried it
recently go in why don't you go to the
dealership do you know what's on the lot
nothing
except a few things that nobody would
want but then you say but Scott you just
order the truck you just order it they
don't have that there's no ordering
process I thought there would be I
thought that's because I've done that
with the Ford for example but but Toyota
said no there's no way to configure it
and order it
online what so how do people get a truck
because well the dealerships you know
get an allocation every month you know
so depending on how many we've sold
before they'll tell us how many we get
and I Sayre put me in line for that
here's what I want they go oh doesn't
work that way I go what the part where I
get what I want goes yeah we don't have
any process for that I go what the hell
is your process well the process is that
they make whatever they want and they're
all different models and different
colors and then they tell you it's going
to ship to you they go
really okay well well why don't you just
I'll see what's in the pipeline and if
there's anything that's kind of close to
what I wanted maybe I'll settle and then
they go okay here's the pipeline I go
all right how about this one oh that
one's already
taken so are the rest of
them that was the
process the process was you can't buy it
in person because it's not there you
can't order it online because they don't
have that service and you can't get one
in the pipeline because as soon as
they're available the first person who
calls buys it do you know why the first
person who calls buys it because there's
no other way to buy a
truck so you tell me that that's a
process in which I can buy a truck
because I don't have that kind of
patience or lock ba basically the
process is like calling into a radio
station and trying to be the 20th caller
that's the
process right so yes you can call into
the radio station and be the 20th caller
but really really can you no one
person can call in and be that 20th
caller the rest of you you don't get to
be the 20th caller and you don't get to
buy the red Tacoma because somebody else
 ordered that before you even
knew it was available no Toyota doesn't
sell
trucks I mean not in any way that you
can specify what you want except by
luck all right here's another science uh
s denil Viagra if you will um improves
BL brain blood flow and could help to
prevent
dementia so they they did this St study
and have found it gives your brain a
boner basically um so you get much more
blood flow to the
brain basically gives your brain a
boner it's the same thing it's doing to
your junk um it lowers your blood
pressure and um could uh prevent
dementia yep
um I'm going to add this to the list of
you could have asked
Scott do you know why I already knew
this because it's well known that it
lowers your blood
pressure do you know what lowering your
blood pressure is good
for your brain your health
everything how could it not
work if it lowers your blood pressure
and there are no side effects that
anybody's figured out
you just could have asked me Scott do
you think this would be good for your
General Health and your brain in the
long run well I know for sure it lowers
blood pressure so yes don't do the
study so what's that three St three
scientific studies you literally could
have just asked me I would have told
you all right how about uh New York is
passing some legislation that would ban
what they call addictive social media
algorith Ms for
kids addictive social media algorithms
what would be the definition of
addictive well the definition is
something
like they show you things that they
think you'd want to see that's actually
what it is so the algorithm shows you
things that they've decided based on who
you are in your activities that you
would want to see more of
something than something else so the New
York wants to make that
illegal I'm a little
confused why would you just make that
illegal when you there's no way you
could possibly enforce it and I'm sure
it'll die in court why wouldn't you just
wouldn't it make more sense to just say
children can't have social media because
the whole point of social media is
looking at what you want if they change
the algorithm so you can't see things
you
want why would anybody even use it
just say you can't use it there there's
plenty of evidence that kids should not
be let's say under 16 at the least
should not be using smartphones and
should not be on social media why would
you pick the one thing that can't
possibly work which is coming up with
what is an addictive algorithm like
there's any chance that's going to stand
up in court it's a it's an indefinable
phrase if if the algorithm means giving
the user something that you think they
might like that would just be every user
interface calling it addictive is
there's just no way that standard could
possibly hold up but you could certainly
do a standard of you're not allowed on
social media or it's illegal for you to
have a phone and by the way there is no
way for parents to handle this on their
own and every time I I hear some parents
like oh you must be a bad parent why
don't you just deny your 14-year-old as
smartphone grow the up it's 2024
you're not no parent is going to deny
their kid a smartphone unless they want
to make them a social
that's the problem but if you took away
everybody's smartphone and you said you
just can't have them under the age of 16
Jonathan hate height however you
pronounce it uh suggest that and I agree
with it definitely they even let let
kids take phones to school
you're just not allowed to take it out
of your pocket which means you just have
it behind the
book it's crazy that that's legal just
insane
anyway um so theme today will be the
dogs not barking and are hypnotizable
leaders there's a story today that I
don't know what to make of it quite yet
there's a uh some NGO which is a
non-government organization funded by
somebody um in this case funded by
the United States at least partially uh
somebody there who was trained by the
United States allegedly and had to do
stuff uh has put together a uh list of
Americans who are against the
Ukrainian war or the funding of it I
suppose would be the way to say it and
uh they put together this list it
includes Trump Elon Musk David Sachs V
ramaswami JD Vance I think there's like
a few hundred like a bunch of people now
who is on the list basically the
smartest
Americans so the
ukrainians decided let's put together a
list of you know the problem people now
some people are calling it an enemies
list and thinking that it's gone way too
far that you're going to make a list of
enemies to which I
say they say it's not an enemies list is
more like who do you need to influence
or you should be aware of what the
others are saying that sort of thing so
I I'm not sure it has that much I don't
know that it has that much impact on the
real world because if you had anything
to do with the United States you already
knew that these famous characters had
these opinions you didn't really need
somebody to put them on a list now if it
goes deeper um apparently I'm not on the
list but if it goes deeper into just big
accounts that complain about Ukraine
well then maybe somebody could learn
something but what exactly are they
going to do troll them harder
like I don't know really how you would
operationalize it so everything about it
is creepy and bad and I don't like it to
happen but on the other hand it's hard
to game out whether it makes a
difference um but the first thing I saw
when I saw who was on the list I so okay
Trump Elan mus David Sachs F JD Vance I
thought to
myself how do I get on that
list how much have I ever wanted to be
on list more than
this seriously I have a chance of being
on the same list for any reason for any
reason as musk saxs Ramos Swami and
Vance yes thank you so you know I posted
please put me on the list because I
can't think of a better list to be on
and also everybody right I'll have
any opinion I want so you can put me on
that
list yeah do you think it's going to
make it more dangerous for me probably
no put me on the list um and I think
they up because they made a list
of the smartest Americans and put them
all in one place and now people know who
they should pay attention to I would
like a full copy of the list so I know
who to follow on social media that
should be your response your response is
give me the list so I can follow
them so I I looked around and for some
reason it's just not really obvious
where to find the full list even though
I tried so if any body has a full list
that includes their um their handle for
the xplatform please post it in a easy
way to cut and paste don't do an image
do it in text if if you have that option
so I can just copy and paste and I'll
I'll follow the top
20 all right so yeah any anybody that
the NGS don't like um I'm going to
follow so here's uh the dog not barking
about the
NGS is it my imagination or do we have a
shadow
government uh somebody's suggesting I'm
not on the list because I registered as
a
Democrat that might be true might be I
doubt it but it might
be anyway so we have all these Nos and
fake factchecking organizations and and
stuff and and also lobbyists if you were
to combine the effect of
Nos and
lobbyists none of whom are elected
aren't they actually running the country
I feel like the NOS are you know the
tail wagon the dong so to speak and
here's what's
missing I feel like the people who
understand what's happening in the world
know you know the Mike Benz kind of
people they know that these NOS are
effectively you know causing Wars and
running the country and running up our
debt and causing all the bad things and
one of the biggest NGO funders is
Alexander
Soros and he's still not being
interviewed and and after making all
this you know I've made quite a bit of
noise about why isn't he on the news
every
day if the news is saying he's
destroying our country by funding things
that are really really bad for the
country such as open borders and you
know more racism Etc if that's happening
and that's real if that's real you
should be on the news every day or at
the very least the news should say we
tried it again and he wouldn't he
wouldn't
respond it's so missing it's just so
obviously missing from the
conversation that the only reason I can
think that he's not on the news every
day is that it's what you think he's a
 I think he actually can't be
trusted to talk in public based on a
brief clip I saw he was he looked like
he had sort of a Biden level of ability
lower
actually um so that story just baffles
me that that's not a top story every
single day now meanwhile Joe Biden
continues his uh embarrassment tour I
believe his he's going to try to
embarrass America uh individually one
country at a time you know there was
some thought he would try to embarrass
us with all the countries simultaneously
but he's picked out of some countries
and now he's in France so he's really
working on the uh making America look
like we're pathetic and I noticed that
when he walks you know he's he's doing
the confused walk thing
again and I gave him a name for his walk
and it's this Optimist past his
prime because he walks like a
robot but maybe an early model you know
one that needs to be replaced it's like
Optimus past his prime yeah quite proud
of that Dad joke all right here's a
scary thing uh chat
gp4 apparently uh hacked 53% of the
systems that tried to hack and the way
it did it was having one agent that
controlled a bunch of other agents that
were also Ai and the other AIS worked as
like sub teams and then the one and
coordinated the work and when they
organized it that way it became sort of
a super hacker great great so now we
have ai that can basically break
into oh just about any secure
system but can you join me in a little
bit of appreciation for the people who
do our election systems because even
though AI obviously can just slice
through most security
protocols isn't it
lucky that that all of our systems
getting hacked I mean remember when we
thought Russia was in all the Ukraine
systems recently we heard that uh you
know our probably China is already in
all of our infrastructure systems you
know the most secure places you could
imagine but they're already
in but thank God nobody's got into our
election systems am I right yeah
Standing Ovation for the election system
people who you know are the best of the
best
because when you get your uh your degree
in computer engineering and you're
thinking where do I want to work well
suckers want to work at Google and apple
with their big high pay and their their
their benefits and their the stock
options all that stuff no if you're the
best of the best in technology you say
to yourself how can I work on the
elections yeah yeah because the best of
the best goes into the election security
field wouldn't you I mean just think
about it think how sexy that sounds you
want to get laid don't say you work for
Google or Apple I mean they're all right
but it's not going to get you laid but
if you say yeah I work on Election
security uh did I say election
security yeah basically that's the you
know panties will be flying off at that
point yeah you you couldn't even avoid
sex if you you said you're working on
security for the elections so that's the
one thing we can be sure of is that
we're getting the best of the best on
the election systems and that's why we
can be 100% sure they've never been
hacked even when all of our other
systems seem to be hacked quite easily
but no no the best of the best are
protecting us on Election
security all right uh now politicos are
is reporting that Trump is attacking
covid vaccine
mandates uh and public health experts
fear it's just the start all right so
we've got Trump on one side and on the
other side would be Public Health
experts
h i remember when that didn't used to be
a
tie do you remember when you said well
I'm certainly going to be backing the
public health experts
like I'm not going to be backing like a
politician like well that's dumb I mean
maybe I'd back him if it was a political
question but I'm not going to back a
politician against the public health
experts well unless you check the track
record how many of you beat all of the
political or all of the health experts
for the last five years
[Laughter]
my track record be all of the health
experts I mean not everyone probably but
the
average and about you would say the same
thing right there were so many sketchy
things during the pandemic that that
every ordinary person just
said I'm not so sure about
that maybe
not so yes Politico this doesn't sound
just the way it used to it used to be
that this would be wow Trump is such an
idiot for doing something that the
public health experts don't think is a
good
idea
no at this point if I get a prescription
from a doctor or a prescription from
Donald Trump it would be a tie I
don't like it I don't like
it but look at the track
record right and I'm not saying he
should be your doctor obviously but if
you were to actually look at the track
record the non-experts beat the experts
so what are you going to do next
time what are you going to do next time
literally well I know what I'm going to
do I'm going to be really careful about
trusting the
experts remember I told you that all the
smart people are on the same side well
Dana White on politics at the moment so
Dana White was talking about Trump
getting the big reception at the UFC
fight and uh
Dana White says you know it's it's not
even so much political it's just common
sense and that itself is sort of a
political statement because of course
it's political but the other thing he
didn't say that I think is the bigger
story Trump got a standing ovation at
the UFC not because it's
political not because it's common
sense it's because it was men
see it's always that's always the big
story and we we try to ignore it because
saying it out loud would change
everything no if you take Trump into a
any large Auditorium filled with men
unless the event was the Democratic
National Convention Trump is going to
bring down the house because
men this was a male event it wasn't a
political event and it wasn't a common
sense event and it wasn't even a trump
event
this was men that was the story if
you're talking about it any other way
you're missing the whole story it was
men all right and so I'm doubling down
and tripling down on my statement that
at this point there literally are no
smart people who are also um for
Biden there are smart people with TDS
and there are smart people who are
easily hypnotizable which is a them team
that I'm getting
to all right um I keep seeing stories of
people who used to vote Democrat or
independent but now say things are so
bad that I'm going to back Trump you've
all seen those
stories have every one of you seen let's
say more than one if you're following
the news um seems like every time
there's a focus group you get one of
those now the focus groups will often
all say that they support
Biden it's of course because you know
half the country seems to so you see you
see these two things you see people who
switched from Democrat to even if
they're still Democrats they're going to
vote for Trump and then you see plenty
of people who like Biden what's
missing is there a dog not barking in
that information something like really
glaringly jumping out obvious that just
doesn't get mentioned yes there's not a
 person in the world who recently
recently changed from Trump to
Biden if that happened even once it
would be all over TV you don't think
MSNBC would be running every day all
right we found some voters yeah they
used to like Trump they they were solid
Republicans until until that felony
conviction now oh now can't vote for
somebody with a felony
conviction do you know what the weakest
part of the Republicans
is is that something like a quarter of
Republicans will put principle above
winning that's their weak
spot so that felony thing uh amazed me
that some significant part of the
Republicans would say you know
what you know I'm not going to vote for
him on principle but then you're going
to lose and you're going to lose the
country and maybe die and everybody will
be basically way worse off and it's an
existential risk to have a guy with no
brain as your president and we can
plainly see it and Republicans will say
I raised my
kids to believe that Character
Matters that's it I'm not going to vote
for a felon if I'm raising my kids to
think that character
matters to which I
say why did you teach your kids to be
losers
you should give me five minutes with
your kids maybe I can fix that because
you just turned your kids into
losers if if you're trying to win on
principle that's called losing that's
just
losing now win first and then you've got
some freedom to do some things on
principle from a point of power but you
don't lose
First losing first is not a strategy and
it's not Noble and I don't have any
respect for it whatsoever I understand
that because the people who are drawn to
the Republican Party are pretty
principle based it's a strong principle
based group and by the way that works
most of the time it's a real good way to
be and most of the time it doesn't make
any difference like most of the time
you're applying it to I don't know I'm
not going to let my kid join the Boy
Scouts because there's something I
didn't like right now that's a principle
that you know you're losing in the sense
that your kid doesn't get to be in the
Boy Scouts but you're not losing much
not losing much and in that case yes
yeah let's push the principal you
because maybe in the long term that can
that can move the problem but if you're
looking at an existential threat and
you're watching people who look like you
and think like you and act like you
being put in jail you're
watching you're watching your ability to
buy groceries drop to zero no first you
 win first win and then
you got some
flexibility but I don't have any respect
for we have to lose on principle I have
no respect for that it's not
strategically smart and it doesn't allow
you to win on principle in the long run
either it's just another way to
lose so the Democrats know that
Republicans will reliably be principle
based even to their own
destruction anyway um Supreme Court has
a bunch of interesting cases that could
change everything so I feel like almost
everything we're saying about everything
doesn't matter until we hear the Supreme
Court now I wasn't quite up to date on
what things are ready to judge but axios
did uh I'm going to give axio some
credit here at what looked like a
completely unbiased article about what
the Supreme Court is working on and I
kept looking for the bias because it's
axios I think it was actually a straight
article and the reason I'm calling it
out is well didn't expect that but uh
here are some of the things presidential
immunity there are two Federal cases
they're looking at and uh Trump's
handling of the classified documents
could turn on that decision so what if
it makes the whole Moralo thing just go
away that's a pretty big event pretty
big event in both ways because people
say we got to pack that Court you know
it's even more important that we get rid
of trump because the the court keeps
agreeing with
him um but that's a big
deal and it looks like the court U might
give Trump what they call a partial
Victory so we don't know what that
really means um then there's the January
6 obstruction case so they're looking at
the question of whether uh obstruction
as defined in the law the law that was
used against the January Sixers uh
apparently the obstruction was drawn up
for more specific situation than that in
other words it was for the Enron sorban
oxil act
um oh the case the case centered around
using the Enron inspired sorban Oxley
act uh and some people say it wasn't
really created for that purpose so
extending that to the January 6 protest
is too far I think it's too
far to me it looks like the Supreme
Court's going to rule that believe it or
not that the January Sixers didn't break
any
laws I think it's going to rule that
everybody in jail didn't break a law
unless unless they did some violence or
some damage but if they were just
protesting the worst law was trespassing
and that's not a jailable offense
usually so that's
gigantic I'm seeing some agreement from
my legal Minds all right
um then there's the abortion pill every
one of these is just fire like every
every thing it looks like it could
change the election so there's a
abortion pill U Mya
Prestone and the question is whether it
can be legal because it gives you uh let
see what is it will decide whether the
FDA um has the authority to allow it I
guess to get it without prescription
maybe is that what it is uh because
nearly 2third of all abortions are
performed just by taking the pill that
pill the abortion pill
um so anyway no matter which way this
goes it's going to be an issue suppose
worst case scenario for the Republicans
is that they get their
way then they get a second way to lose
on principle good job Republicans you
found another way to lose and unusable
election great why don't why don't you
find a way to make abortion the top
topic and make it look like the
Republicans are the only thing that
prevent you from getting this
pill could you be Dumber now obviously
it's not the Republican Party who's
pushing these Supreme Court cases but
whoever is pushing him is almost
certainly
Republican and unless it's an OP
where somebody's pretending to be a
republican just so they can get this
issue there this is just the dumbest
thing I've ever seen Republicans do you
couldn't wait a
year you couldn't wait a year until it
doesn't matter so much to the election
process but if the Republicans lose and
if they lose because this anti-abortion
looking thing uh
happens God did you deserve it you so
deserve to
lose if this is your got to have my
principles you just deserve to
lose I mean I'd hate to see it but God
you're just begging to
lose uh and then there's another one
about emergency abortion care same thing
did it have to did it have to be a month
before you know a few months before the
election really crazy all
right all all right what else we got
going on here tons going on it's all fun
oh and then one on gun rights whether
the bump stock ban was too far so great
so now the uh the left that is most
animated by abortion and guns will have
an abortion maybe two abortion uh
decisions and a gun decision that
they're not going to
like let's talk about General Millie
so as you know General Millie was the uh
military guy in charge during the
January 6 situation he was in charge in
general not just uh over that but he was
a head of the military and Julie Kelly
is reporting that uh during
Congressional
testimonies uh the legal council for the
DC National
Guard noted that mil's alleged fears of
a quote rag moment after the
election so we have direct
reporting and even using a quote that
Millie believed that Trump was going to
go full Hitler and burn down the rice
stag maybe that's a symbolic statement
you know uh not literally but that he
would try to stay in power by creating
some kind of
Chaos in other
words General Millie the top guy in our
military
is easily
hypnotizable meaning that he has
TDS now I would like to suggest a
standard for our leaders that I think
we've never tested before but in the
military
especially you should do a test to see
how hypnotizable you are that can
actually be
determined and if this guy actually
believed that Trump was going to do a
you know Hitler takeover like a you know
military take over the country you
become a
dictator there's something wrong with
you that in other words you've fallen
for your own your own party's um
propaganda so I don't I don't believe
that Nancy Pelosi believes the thing
she's saying you know about democracy
ending I don't I don't think uh
Carville believes what he's saying about
your Constitution going to be taken away
we'll never get to vote again you do you
be taking you a democracy way I don't
think he believes that you know why
because Nancy Pelosi and
Carville look to me like people who know
enough about the real world that they're
not
hypnotizable they look like they're just
operating in a mechanical world where if
you do this it works if you do this
other thing it doesn't work that's what
it looks like to me so it looks like
they're both trying to do what works and
that is not
brainwashed but Millie
was making policy
decisions based on a
hallucination and we know that I mean we
know from reporting we know that he
actually thought he was living in a 1939
moment now that's actually mental
illness Andor too
hypnotizable so about 20% of the public
can be easily convinced of just anything
and you can test for that now you'd have
to test to figure out the best way to
test for it but hypnotist do it all the
time that's what a stage magician does
stage hypnotist a stage hypnotist looks
at the crowd gives them a suggestion and
then can tell with pretty good accuracy
maybe 80% accuracy which people are
going to be good subjects if they bring
them up on stage here's how easy the
test is this is just one form of it the
hypnotist on stage says everybody put
your hands together like you're praying
the audience all does it because they're
playing along he goes now your hands are
stuck together they can't move apart
they're stuck together like magnets pull
them apart then he looks at the audience
and everybody in the audience succeeds
they all pull it apart so you say to
yourself well but how do you know who's
more hypnotizable they all pulled it
apart you know there's nobody who
couldn't pull their hand apart you look
for the small
hesitation right now if you're only
listening you can't see this but the
person who's not hypnotizable just goes
like this the person who is hypnotizable
goes like
this there's just a little bit of delay
and the hypnotist is trained to say ah
there's one with about 80% accuracy and
then they bring him up and they give him
another little test just something quick
and if that doesn't work well then it
was a false positive and they send them
back to their seat and they keep the
ones that are kind of past two tests
that's how it's done now if you can do
it that easily as a stage hypnotist
there's probably some scientific version
of that and you might be able to do it
with sensors you know basically um see
if you can get somebody to respond to
certain images there's probably a way to
do
it but I can't think of anything scarier
than thinking that the head of our
military believed he was in a 1939 fight
with Hiller just hold that in your mind
the head of the military
I'm not making this up believed he was
in a 1939
moment just just think about
that and it was because he couldn't see
through the from his own
propaganda media on the left his own I'm
assuming he's leaning
Democrat isn't isn't that
dangerous I absolutely think you need to
check these guys for susceptibility
yeah you really need to
check all
right um Stephen McIntyre who does the
he's at the at climate audit account
usually he's talking about climate but
um he has a quite analytical mind and so
when he wads into politics is worth a
read and he's talking about in 2019 in
2020 there were a lot the when we were
talking about struck and Paige and the
FBI and their messages we saw their
messages that seemed to be on point to
whatever they were talking about but
what I didn't realize is there was a
whole bunch of
redactions and that what we saw was
highly
curated now you say to yourself well
that's okay because a lot of it was
probably just personal stuff and you
know maybe Secrets off point and stuff
like that but we're not really in that
place where we ever trust any kind of a
um political editing of somebody's words
you just assume there's something there
you wanted to say but it gets worse and
this is something that McIntyre noticed
is that the period that seems especially
missing is about the time that the uh
that there was some conversation with
the steel sub uh uh sub what do they
call them
subsource so in other words when the
conversation was was Steel's document
good or was the steel document coming
from a source that you should have known
was a fake source so during the time
when the fake Source should have been
discussed by these same cats those
messages there aren't any there's no
reference to it now does that mean
there's a Smoking Gun that they they
knew it was fake and that maybe they
mentioned it but those messages got
edited well I don't know we don't know
enough to say that what we do know is
that we'd most like to know is not
available
so so we're we're tired we're we're at
the place where we don't trust any
accidents well that's a coincidence well
maybe there are no
coincidences
yeah
so uh
meanwhile uh James Clapper was asked uh
by some news person I think it might
have been on Fox Maybe but he was asked
um if he wanted to apologize for saying
that laptop from Hill the hunter Baden
laptop was possibly Russian
disinformation what do you think Clapper
said when asks if he's thinking of
apologizing for one of the worst acts
we've seen in America you think you want
to apologize one word
no why would he apologize for something
that he did intentionally and worked
exactly the way he wanted it to and in
his view save the country why would he
apologize no he didn't make a
mistake he he made an OP it worked it
was kind of brilliant in the sense that
it was pretty convincing and it probably
moves the election it probably did move
the
election so here's somebody who over
probably overthrew the country and asked
us to apologize no because that's what I
was trying to
do I added that last part
so that ladies and gentlemen is my
prepared comments for
today um and I'm going to double down
and quadruple down on the fact that the
the smartest people you see on the left
who are still supporting
Biden are clearly suffering from
TDS now it could be that maybe that's my
own bias speaking but when I look at
Bill Mah just take an example he's got
all kinds of logical sounding opinions
about everything except Trump as soon as
he talks about Trump it's either missing
information you know like like he
thought that police were killed on
January 6th for a while I think he
believed the drinking bleach thing I
think for a while he believed the fine
people
hoax it's just a huge huge I wouldn't
call it the blind spot it's a
TDS but I also wonder if you could test
those same people and find out if
they're easily
hypnotizable uh let me give you somebody
on the right who I can tell you for sure
is easily hypnotizable Tucker
Carlson I guarantee he's in the
20% I guarantee it and here's how I can
tell as smart as he is he's super smart
as good as his content is and it's super
good he's one of the you know great
Treasures of the country at the moment
in my opinion he does have a preference
for believing in you know some of the
wild stuff you know demons and aliens
and whatnot and that is really a strong
indication of somebody being in the 20%
who are super hypnotizable everybody's
hypnotizable but 20% can actually live
in a world that doesn't exist that you
can create a you can create a world in
their mind that's just just not here
so Tucker has told us a number of times
in a number of different ways that when
it comes to sort of this fun conspiracy
theory stuff not the things that
necessarily matter because he says it
directly you know that that his his
belief in some of the Wilder things
don't have a connection to anything
you're going to do about it in the real
world so it's really a a luxury belief
or I I'll call it an entertainment
belief there are things that I believe
just for
entertainment for example if you put a
gun to my head and said did aliens
really help build the P pyramids if you
get this wrong I'm going to blow your
brains out I would
say no probably
not but if you don't have a gun to my
head and there's no real world
implication I kind of like believing the
aliens
helped do you see the point there are
some things we believe just for fun it's
just we don't always you know tell
ourselves that's why we believe it but
when it comes down to things that are
going to kill me completely different
standard you all all that imaginary
stuff goes right away immediately and I
go right to what matters I would argue
that the people operating on Republican
principle over winning are operating
under hypnosis because it doesn't make
makes sense on a logical basis and it's
sort of obvious to the rest of us so I
would think that they're essentially
brainwashed into their ethical beliefs
which works most of the time you know
most of the time you want to brainwash
children at least and having a you know
good character ethical framework it's
what makes the the country work um so
you don't want to get rid of that it's
just that you have to understand what it
is
I hear that General Mark Millie is a
decent family man nobody said he wasn't
yeah you know I don't have any trouble
giving you that that seems like a Millie
supporter is Mark Millie a decent family
man could be could be and and if he is
if that's true I I would certainly
praise
that but that doesn't mean he is not
susceptible to hypnosis he's clearly
susceptible uh let's let's take another
example
Sam
Harris I think everybody can see that
Sam Harris is logical except when it
comes to Trump and then there's just
something going on that looks
personal um and then you're going to ask
me about Mark
Cuban Mark Cuban fascinates me because
whatever is going on with Mark cubin
doesn't look like because he has some
you know mental problem it doesn't look
like he has
TTS he just doesn't he doesn't act like
it here here's my best guess of what he
was doing with Dei and maybe also with
Biden but to a lesser
extent I think he was steelmanning the
arguments meaning trying to give the
best version of the arguments that the
Democrat should be making argument in
favor of Dei argument in favor of
Biden and and I'm going to give
God really the the the use comment there
was somebody said he's B
Jewish okay I don't think that's
relevant to anything I'm going to
say it doesn't involve every single
topic all right here's my best guess I
start with the assumption that there's
no way that uh Mark cuin is dumb because
he's been operating way above smart for
decades right in front of us so can we
eliminate he's not smart can can we just
drop that because that that's such a low
IQ take that he's not smart he's really
smart about a lot of things right you
might disagree with
them but when he does the Dei support
and the Biden
support uh I think he might you know
want that team to win but I feel like
what he's doing is trying to present the
strongest version of their best
arguments because he can do it better
than they can do it and and he did
actually um and here's
why I think he's testing their own
arguments but he's doing it in a way
that most supports the people that he
loves and cares about and hires so
imagine if you were working for Cuban
and you were a you know one of the
people in the uh categories of benefits
from Dei and you saw your CEO out there
fighting for it and you knew it was good
and you liked it and you knew it was
good for people like you well you'd be
pretty loyal to that that person now you
might say but what about the white
people who hate it well you can reliably
reliably predict that the white people
will just put up with it because they
always do so what would be the best play
for Mark Cuban if he wanted his
employees to be loyal and have a good
reputation exactly what he's doing is
that
crazy nope nope I think that steel
Manning their argument and winning would
be a gigantic win meaning that if he if
he gave the better version of the
argument and actually you made the day
and people even people who disagreed up
to that point go you know wow that was a
good argument I hadn't really thought of
it that way so that's one possibility
the other possibility is that he does
his Mark Cuban best to say Dei is good
and he fails completely while we watch
that's also good do you get that if if
he sells his program because it's a good
idea and a good argument sells people
that's good because he sold a good
thing if it
fails that's good too because it means
the best argument on their side which he
is actually equipped to give the best
argument on their side didn't
work and then it's not his
fault he he can show the
flaws without being on the other side of
it so I'll give you two hypotheses and
you tell me which one makes which fits
the what fits the evidence
better that he's smart in every way
except this one
way or that the intelligence you've seen
them apply consistently in public for
decades is universal and it applies to
this area too and that I can't think of
a better public service if you think
about it you know you got you all got
your juices running and you got all mad
about him and he thought what is he
crazy and he's a partisan and he's got
TDS and whatever he
thought but when he was done he had
presented you the best version of their
argument and also had presented it in a
way that you could see a gigantic hole
in it and the gigantic hole was that if
every everybody did what Mark Cuban says
you could do which is try harder to get
you know better candidates and then
you've got all your diversity then it
can't be done because there's a limited
pool maybe one company can do it maybe
Apple can do it because people want to
work at Apple so they could suck up all
the people who are available and fit the
categories but don't you think that Mark
Cuban knows it's
undoable of course he
does of course he does undoable unless
you lower your standard
and that has nothing to do with
anybody's genes or culture it's just
numbers so I think that he presented a
public
service in the way that only somebody
like him could do and when I say
somebody like him he had to have two
qualities maybe three one super smart
and that's not the important one because
there are other super smart
people willingness to embarrass himself
in public
have you ever noticed he has that have
you ever seen him at a basketball game
yes Mark cubin has the
willingness that if there's something to
be gained or at least nothing to be lost
he will embarrass himself in public that
could include yelling at the ref until
he gets a big
fine right it it could be anything that
he needs to do to make it
work
so as much as I disagree on Dei
I think that what he added to the
process was really really good because
it was a serious long running
conversation with other super smart
people in public on acts where he made
his best strongest
argument in my opinion he showed its
Flaws by showing this is the strongest
argument and it still had this giant
hole in
it that's
useful that is
useful so don't don't discount him with
the other people yeah I think he's just
playing a different game or or let me
generalize this if I'm totally wrong
which is certainly
possible whatever is the real answer is
going to be something interesting it
it's not going to
be that he was dumb or he was crazy it's
not going to be that so I don't know
what it is but it's not going to be
that all right ladies and gentlemen I'm
going to say uh some words to the
locals people if you haven't bought it
yet make sure you get a copy of my new
book that's a combination of my two
previously published books that are

categories and it's the perfect Father's
Day gift all right um bye to everybody
