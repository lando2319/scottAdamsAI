sing with me everybody
okay that's not much of a sing-along
song i guess
but we don't need to sing because we've
got more fun to do
more fun to have it's time for coffee
with scott adams the best part of your
day
every single time every now and then
you'll wake up and say
i wonder if today will be the day that
coffee with scott adams
is not the best part of my day
and then it is every single time and all
you need to enjoy it is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker tell
us to stein a canteen juggerflip
or flask a vessel of any kind
somebody's saying that there's no audio
uh that must be
why would there be no audio
let me see if i can fix that
so it looks like youtube can hear me and
periscope cannot
uh and it doesn't look like there's any
way to fix the
uh periscope so
go to youtube for sound
go to youtube
for sound
so if you can't hear me
go to youtube for sound
so i'm just gonna
uh i'm just gonna turn off periscope
all right periscope's not working for
some reason that's not
obvious because everything's the same
so i guess we won't be doing periscope
today we'll just be doing uh youtube
because youtube seems to be working for
some reason um
very disappointing very disappointing
but i'll wait for a second the periscope
people will probably uh jump over to
youtube
all right there's some uh breaking news
the uh nobel peace prize committee
has decided that the 2020 nobel peace
prize is going to go to
uh to the uh
world food program that's right the
world
food program is going to get the nobel
peace prize
and this is why you should only have
originalists on the
nobel peace prize committee because who
exactly were the runner-ups
were the runner-ups um
all right i've lost my entire flow
because the sound problem over on
periscope
just just blew my entire routine
and we do need to have the simultaneous
sip so let's
let's do that and maybe i can get back
on track
i think the periscope people are
probably waiting for me to
reinitiate but it won't work if i do so
i'm not going to
join me now for the simultaneous up
oh that's a little better yeah sometimes
you need those anchoring things
somebody somebody says i have a
coronavirus
uh misinformation warning is that why
the sound didn't work
on periscope did i get a misinformation
warning
interesting maybe so maybe this one will
get
blocked as well uh anyway
governor whitmer apparently there was a
kidnapping kidnapping plot
an actual plot to kidnap the governor
governor whitmer and
the reporting says that the people
involved in the kidnapping
were antifa and right wingers
what are the odds the anti-fa and right
wingers were working together
on a plot i'm going to go out on a limb
and say the odds of that
actually being true that antifa
and right wingers were working together
the odds of that being true
are approximately zero but
what if it is true if it is true
that should be a little tap on the
shoulder if you're a governor
if you're the governor and you find the
antifa and the right wing
have decided to get together and kidnap
you
maybe the problem's on your side because
wha how bad a job could you do that you
could make
antifa and the right wingers want to
kidnap you
that's a pretty bad job so that would be
a signal to
look for other work
all right um let's talk about uh
packing the supreme court as you know
biden and
kamala harris refuse to answer the
question
of whether they would pack the court now
if somebody refuses to answer the
question
it means they're going to back the court
now some have suggested that biden
doesn't really believe that so the
reason he's not talking about it
is so that he doesn't uh he doesn't
discourage his own voters so the
thinking is that biden is lying to his
own voters
by acting as if as if he might do it
uh and but they think we also think he
might be lying to
trump voters by acting like he won't do
it
so he's got this clever little thing
where he'll just say i'm not going to
tell you what i'm going to do it's the
most
important question in the in the
election
because if the court is backed it could
be the under the republic
now what are the odds that it would be
the end of the republic
pretty good actually pretty good because
if any administration packs the court
one of two things will happen either
they will control the government forever
because everything that they try to get
away with the court will back them up
because they packed the court so it
could be the end of the republic i would
say that's
at least a 30 chance if you back the
court
and by the way the trump campaign should
put some odds on this because if you
just say
court packing ruins the republic or
doesn't
if you make it binary it's definitely
going to ruin the republic
or it's definitely not pick one well
it's more likely not because we're
actually pretty good at getting
it you know adjusting to just about
anything
but i'd say there's a solid 30 chance it
would destroy the entire
country so one way to look at it is
you don't know what's going to happen
but there's a
pretty healthy chance that that one that
one
act of government would destroy the
entire republic
and i think that you could make that
case pretty convincingly
yeah i don't think the trump
administration has made that case
or the campaign has not made that case
um
i also think it needs to be a visual
somebody probably needs to make whatever
is the
simple picture of what happens if you
pack the court
and if you see it in a picture and maybe
it's a meme or something
that might help because i feel as if if
you took a poll
of the citizens of the united states and
said
how important do you think this court
packing is on a scale of one to ten
where does that
live in terms of importance well i think
people would only answer the question
based on whether they wanted democrats
or republican staff control
i don't think they would answer the
question in terms of being good or bad
for the country in the long run
and that's because they're not educated
to think of it in terms of
risk management so if you turn that into
a risk
management question and you put a solid
30
odds that it will ruin the entire
country and i feel like that's
conservative
there's at least a 30 chance that
packing the court
would be the end of democracy in
this country for all practical purposes
um i guess president trump's going to do
his first in-person interview since
contracting chronovirus he's going to
talk to dr mark siegel on fox news
i think that might be today
oh it's going to air on tucker carlson's
show tonight
now here's what i'm thinking
don't you agree that president trump
probably needs to
do something to shake the box to get
elected
at least he's behind in the polls i'm
not sure i believe the polls at this
point
because i don't believe any data in 2020
but let's say you believe that he's
behind
let's say you believe the polls and he
needs to do something
to change it now let's say that he
doesn't have another debate
what can he do what can he do
to shake things up uh in a
in a political way now of course he
could do something in terms of his job
so he could handle his job better or
whatever and
you know there might be some surprises
maybe saudi arabia
comes out and says surprise we want to
do a deal with israel
you could see something big i'll just
put that out there as one example
maybe saudi arabia says hey we're in
we're in for the
middle east peace deal that would seem
like a pretty big thing
um so there might be you know some other
policy things that could be brewing that
might happen
not necessarily that one but here is my
suggestion for what trump could do
that's
practical that would shake up the
campaign
you should do an interview with me
now i would be one of 10 000
people who say he should do an interview
with them yeah some people say you
should do an interview with joe rogan
now i love joe rogan i think he's you
know he's approaching
national treasure you know status as
being a
you know an unusually valuable citizen
of the country let's put it that way
unusually you know useful and positive
in my opinion but i could do a better
interview
not even close because i could do a
better interview than anybody could
now uh i'm not exactly modest about my
capabilities so you need to factor that
in of course
but there are plenty of things i'm bad
at that i'll also tell you i'm bad at
i mean i i draw cartoons for a living
and i don't think i'm good at drawing
cartoons
so i'm pretty willing to tell you i'm
bad at stuff
i'm willing to tell you that i have a
face for radio
you know i sniff too much uh you know i
got plenty of problems
so if you're looking for me to be honest
about my faults
i got lots of them you know how long do
you want the list to be
i'll start now alphabetical order all
the things that i do poorly
it's a pretty long list but the fact is
i can give the best interview of
president trump
that would happen this political season
and many of you know that's true
you know that's true because i wouldn't
ask the same questions
and i would find out what the real
issues are
and i would help the country understand
them in a way that they've never seen
them before
and i'm pretty sure i could make that
happen so if the trump campaign wants
that interview uh you know where to find
me
but but i do think trump needs to do
something to shake up the
the way we're thinking of things and
what's left if he doesn't do a debate
what's left it's got to be an interview
and it's got to be the right type all
right
i reported joe biden's uh twitter
account to twitter for
inciting violence and specifically
it's where he continues to repeat the
fine people hoax
even yesterday the most widely debunked
hoax
in the history of the united states and
he repeated it again
yesterday and the maddening thing about
it is that there's no reason
he shouldn't keep doing it because it
works
and the news industry is so broken
that they can't they can't expose it so
you know the people on the right you can
yell all day long but the people on the
left will just never hear it
they will be completely unaware that
this is a hoax and if they do hear
there's a hoax
they quite reasonably believe that the
news is fake
right because if you don't believe
a lot of the news that you you see and
you don't
why would anybody else if there's
anybody who believes the stories they
see on the internet and then the news
well they've got some explaining to do i
don't know why you believe anything
these days
all right so i repeat i reported him for
inciting violence
because in my opinion it's it's pretty
straightforward
in my opinion if you are accusing the
president of
complementing neo-nazis and white
supremacists
and you're claiming that he's never
denounced them although their
compilation clips of
denouncing them all over the place if
you're selling that
story you are also selling violence
because you can't separate those if he
is the person that joe biden says he is
and his supporters you know know it
which is what the democrats would claim
hey all you supporters
you know who you're supporting
so therefore you're no better than
in other words you would also be white
supremacists
or white supremacist supporters
in this country is it acceptable
to perform violence against white
supremacists
well it's not legal it's not legal
you know unless they're doing some crime
against you i guess
but uh it's certainly acceptable in
terms of moral
and ethical acceptability if you heard a
story
about a white supremacist or an actual
racist who got beat up
by somebody else would you care as much
as if it had been somebody else
probably not and if you're a democrat
you would think it was a good day
you'd say yeah glad that white
supremacist supporter got beat up
so the accusation itself is a call to
violence
in a way that any other accusation is
not
if you hear president trump say that
kamala harris is a socialist
does that make you want to beat her up
or beat up her supporters
nope nope calling somebody a socialist
is not a call to violence
not even close not even a little bit
how about if you say that joe biden has
some dementia problems
could be true could be false but it's
not a call to violence
are you going to be somebody up because
they voted for somebody who had some
mental capacity problems nope
nope you don't beat people up for that
but you would certainly beat somebody up
if you thought they were hitler or
hitler supporters
that's that's beat up material so i
think
i think twitter should remove any claims
from joe biden
on the fine people hoax on the violence
level and by the way just so i'm
perfectly clear about this
you know it's hard to tell what i'm
joking sometimes there is
no joke in this that is super dangerous
uh language you know perpetuating that
hoax
it is absolutely dangerous
absolutely 100 true
no hyperbole in this that is dangerous
speech
and it shouldn't be on social media
so jack if you're listening that is
completely serious and i think you
should take it seriously
and i don't think there's any other
topic like that one
there there's nothing else i compare it
to that is even slightly
you know that bad all right um
let's talk about the coronavirus so all
the smart people tell us and they're
probably right about this
that how the country thinks about the
coronavirus
leadership in this country will
determine the election
and determine the fate of the united
states so you would all agree
on that right that it's probably true
that how people think of the coronavirus
leadership will determine the fate of
the united states
because it will determine the presidency
and maybe congress too
so what if we got that data wrong
if the data is wrong in in a meaningful
way
not in a slight way but in a meaningful
way
we would be making the most important
decision in the history of the united
states
or at least in recent years in the
history of the united states
and we would be using the wrong data to
do it
here's my problem and let me give you
some context for this
some of you know i used to have lots of
corporate jobs before i was doing
cartooning and before this and my
corporate jobs
were based on my background in economics
i have a degree in economics i've got an
mba
i spent most of my corporate time
looking at spreadsheets and numbers and
data
most of it all right and one of the
things i
i discovered when i first took my first
serious you know data analysis job
is that i had a boss who i would i would
hand her
a spreadsheet like literally a page with
just
full of numbers it would just be a
blizzard of numbers that i'd done on a
spreadsheet
and i'd go into my boss and i'd say all
right i finished this analysis you want
it here it is
and my boss would pick up the
spreadsheet and
in approximately two seconds she would
do this
well that number doesn't look right
check this number
and remember the whole page is full of
numbers
and in two seconds she would pick out
that one number that looked fishy
and she'd say go check this one out then
i'd go check that out
and it would be a typo or or a bad data
and i would go back to her and say how
the heck do you do that
because it wasn't like one time it was
like this regular thing she could do
like a
like the skills she developed in in
doing this kind of work for years
and i said how do you do that and she
said i don't know
i don't know it's just sort of a a skill
an instinct
an intuition you develop where you can
just look at stuff and you can pick out
the error
well i did that job for a number of
years after having that
experience and i started to develop that
same skill
to the point where it's a it's a running
thing that i talk about with christina
all the time
where she'll ask me to estimate the cost
of something that i don't know
anything about and i can estimate it
with weird accuracy
so she'll say something like i'll just
make this one up how much would it cost
to send a camel to mars
which i'm guessing nobody's ever
estimated that cost and i'll sit there
and i'll think
oh camel camel to mars
that's about uh well if you start from
scratch and you don't use the assets of
nasa
let's say a 10-year project send the
candle to mars
i think that's about 23 to 25 billion
dollars
and then someday somebody sends a camel
to mars and it costs 24 billion dollars
it's just this weird ability that you
develop
and not because i'm extra smart you know
the reason i brought up my boss
same reason yeah if you just do the work
and i'll bet you can find this out from
other people
people can smell wrong data if they've
worked with data enough
i would imagine that nate silver for
example
i would guess that if nay silver looks
at a big page of data
that because of his experience he can do
that that
that's wrong betty can do that all day
long
because it's just the skill you develop
so today i went looking at the
coronavirus
death rates and let me tell you with all
of the
intuition and skill that i've developed
in finding
bs numbers that the coronavirus death
statistics
death statistics are not just wrong
for the united states they're not just
wrong
but they're really wrong and i'm i'm
going to take
a stand for that right now now i've
i've talked at great length about why
the numbers might be wrong in the past
but this is different because i didn't
realize how
wrong they were until i looked at him
this morning our death rates are
something like 10 to 20 times
worse than countries that you would
expect would be similar
now i have been saying things like well
we have more obesity
we have a greater population of
african-american
citizens there are greater risk and i've
been trying to explain
it by things like that and and also by
financial incentives and hospitals
apparently you'll get a little extra
money if you say you were treating a
coronavirus patient and that's why they
died
but here's the new information
the new information is if you took all
of those things
and said okay by coincidence there's a
whole bunch of things in the united
states that are different
we got the obesity we got the you know
maybe the different drugs maybe we've
got more international travel
maybe we're we have more love of freedom
so less compliance
maybe we started a little late maybe you
know with
with locking down uh maybe we did bad
things with the rest homes
you know especially compared to other
countries maybe
you know maybe it's something about the
demographics maybe it's our dna
if you added all of that together
it wouldn't explain how completely wrong
our data is compared to other countries
completely wrong we're having a thousand
deaths a day
where other countries that you think
would be acting somewhat similarly
or having a dozen or you know a few
dozen
it's not even close all of those other
effects
put together even if you can imagine
that they were all valid and they all
changed the numbers
might move at 40 percent right
so everything that we've talked about
that we know of
that we can see we can we can verify is
true
all together it might make our number 40
wrong and that's not even in the general
zip code of the universe of the solar
system
of how wrong the number is it's not 40
wrong
it's somewhere like 20 times wrong all
right
there's something missing that we don't
know about
i don't know what it is i'm going to
speculate all right
here's my speculation it's based on very
sketchy and non-credible
information that i saw on the internet
so
you should you should dial back your
credibility on this following point
but if you're looking for something
that's a gigantic difference
none of the things i've mentioned get
you there none of them do
now a lot of you think it's because the
way we code it there's a financial
incentive in the hospital
and that's the big difference but if you
look into that financial incentive
the extra money you get for coding at
coronavirus
basically pays the extra cost of taking
care of a coronavirus patient
because you can't take care of other
patients
you have to decrease your hospital usage
so basically it's not that you would get
a windfall from treating coronavirus
patients
it's that they cost more so all you are
doing is getting paid
for the fact that they do cost more so
i'm not sure that explains it but i did
hear this explanation
that in germany for example and let's
use that as a proxy for other countries
that in germany which is doing wildly
better than the united states
it's not even in the same ballpark right
that if you have cancer and you have
coronavirus
and you die germany calls it a cancer
death
and the united states calls it a
coronavirus death
which one of them is right and by the
way
if that's true i need a fact check on
that but if it's true
then germany would count the underlying
condition
as opposed to the thing you just got
this week if that's true and we do it
the other way
that would explain the entire difference
i think so i need a fact check on that
but if that's all that's going on and
we're going to make a
decision about our leaders based on
data that is wrong by a factor of 10 to
20
we need to fix that and we need to fix
that
right away and i think that might be the
the best hypothesis
but if that's not the case if it turns
out
that the way we record it is backwards
from the way other places do it
if that's the only story i'd be
surprised i think
there might even be something bigger
somebody says if that's true it's
mind-boggling let me ask you this
take a look at the news on any
any major story that has a political
element to it
the coronavirus obviously has a
political element to it
look at a story that has a scientific
element to it
the coronavirus has a scientific element
to it
in what situations do we have news about
something that is both political
and scientific in it and it's squarely
in both domains
very political very scientific
when in those situations do we get
accurate information
maybe never maybe never ever
maybe it's never happened in the history
of human
behavior the coronavirus data is exactly
the kind of stuff that we're
always lying to ourselves about it
couldn't be
more perfectly the kind of thing you lie
about
so if if the coronavirus data is
accurate
and by accurate i mean if it's even
within 40 percent of being accurate
i would be amazed
because it would be the first time we
ever had a situation like this
that we were in the general ballpark
because usually
this situation political and scientific
that takes you to outer space in terms
of credibility
all right here's another hypothesis
mike dewsburg on twitter suggests this
um so he's knows somebody an emergency
care doctor
who told him personally that quote what
happened in march wasn't natural
and the night day difference in the
cases i see now
compared to then also isn't natural
so there's a doctor who says um i can't
really
this doesn't pass the sniff test because
if you look at what the country is doing
you know to mitigate the mass and the
social distancing and everything
if you look at all that it doesn't seem
to be enough
to explain why the cases dropped
so fast and so his idea is that there
might have been some targeted release
targeted release let's say you were
a foreign adversary you're a foreign
adversary and you learned that
every country is going to get the
coronavirus what would you do
if you wanted to harm a foreign country
in the context of a pandemic where
everybody has more coronavirus
what you would do is you would make sure
that that country got a little extra
infected how hard would that be
unfortunately not hard
not hard because if you had access to
the
virus and you were a spy organization
of some other country that was not
friendly it wouldn't be hard
to make sure there was a little extra
someplace
do you remember when iran first
you first heard the reports out of iran
that there were infections
and the very next thing you heard is
that some of the inner circle was
immediately infected you know
khamenei's inner circle immediately
there were
top clerics who were infected and i said
to myself
could be a coincidence but if i were
trying to take down a country
the first thing i would do is make sure
that the you know the the lower level
um politicians got infected
because that that would change the
nature of the whole
country so i'm not saying there's
evidence
of any of that and i certainly hope it
did not happen
but can you rule it out can you rule it
out
i don't know how you can because it's
perfectly in the category of things that
happen in this world all right
when i looked at the uh the death rate
by coronavirus i noticed that we track
the the death rates per million
is accumulative isn't that exactly the
wrong way to
to measure the death rate per million
shouldn't we have you know one number
that is the
you know from the beginning of time the
death rate
but shouldn't there be another number
that's the death rate per million
say in the last 30 days because whatever
you're doing lately
is likely to be really different from
what you did in the beginning
so could you not have a situation where
you were really bad in the beginning but
you're doing great now
and vice versa that that missing data
feels like the only one that matters in
fact if you said to me scott
we're going to only be able to measure
one thing
so you tell us what you need need to be
measured
to to handle the coronavirus thing and i
would say well
the only thing i care about the only
data that would
be meaningful to me to see how we're
doing
is the death rate per million for the
last 30 days and then
keep a rolling 30 days it's the only
thing that's not available
right i mean i guess somebody could
calculate it
but it's not the number one thing that's
reported and i'm thinking
that's the only thing i care about the
total number of people is misleading
because of different populations
and the cumulative is misleading because
you might have gotten a bad start or a
good start
but it doesn't tell you what's happening
lately
so is it a coincidence that the only
useful information
is not reported is there nobody who
reports data who doesn't know what i
just told you
of course they do why don't they give
you the information that would be most
useful
i don't know i don't know has to be
intentional
um all right
[Applause]
uh there are two lies
one by conservatives and one by liberals
that seem very balanced meaning that
it's the same lie
it's just reversed for the other side
and it goes like this
um biden claims
that uh trump one and kamala harris
claim
that trump wants to get rid of
pre-existing conditions or that he will
get rid of pre-existing conditions
but trump says no i'm going to get rid
of obamacare
which includes the protection for
pre-existing conditions
so that part's true but we're not going
to get rid of all the parts
we're going to keep one of the parts and
that part is
maintaining pre-existing conditions
coverage
so the president says clearly
consistently
unambiguously it is his intention
to get rid of obamacare but to keep that
one part of it that people care about
the most
could not be more clear about that and
biden and harris
say well you're going to get rid of
pre-existing conditions
now what it could mean and this would be
fair if they were to say it this way it
would be fair
they might say you have not assured us
that you're going to take care of
pre-existing conditions
we feel as if we don't trust you
to take care of pre-existing conditions
but it's basically a lie because he
simply only made a promise
and you can't say somebody's promise
won't be kept
until it happens right because it's
certainly within the category of things
he could do
is it would it be impossible to keep
pre-existing conditions
no no it wouldn't be impossible
so and the president's pretty darn good
at keeping his promises
his campaign promises so that's
just the lie by the biden and kamala
harris people
in the sense that they could have said
we don't trust it to happen
but it's a lie to say you're going to do
it
now reversing this because the lying
doesn't all happen in one direction
the trump campaign and people
uh who are friendly with it are saying
that biden and kamal harris
plan to raise taxes on the middle class
biden and harris say that's not true
we're going to repeal the trump
tax cuts but we're not going to change
the part
that affected the people under 400 000 a
year
so we're saying as clearly as we
possibly can
just as clearly as trump says he's going
to maintain
pre-existing conditions just as clearly
as that
binding harris are saying no we're going
to get rid of the tax cuts for the
rich people but we're totally not going
to touch the ones at the bottom
now again in similar fashion you might
say to yourself
i know that's what they say but i don't
trust them to do that
i don't believe that they'll do that
which is the real problem
all right so both sides are lying to you
in exactly the same fashion so but i i
would trust that you're smart enough to
pick that out there's a gallup poll
that's kind of interesting
and it said that uh they
it's been called an incredible finding
and i think it is
that uh 56 people 56 of the public
in the u.s say that they're better off
today
56 are better off than they were a few
years ago
apparently that's a historical record
the number of people who think they're
better off today
under trump is at an all-time high
it's never been higher and it's not even
really close
it's substantially higher than it has
ever been before
shouldn't that be the only thing that
matters
shouldn't it be crazy i mean let me put
it this way
when we're measuring everything from
systemic racism to
income inequality to just about
everything we tend to look at
how much money you're making you know
whether you're in jail or
likely to be jailed you know and all
these things that could be
measured so a lot of measurable stuff
but what if everybody's about equally
happy
is there anything to fix shouldn't the
goal of life
be to be happy right
if i gave you a choice of i'll give you
you know a million dollars uh and you'll
be unhappy
or i'll give you you know an ordinary
income but you'll definitely be happy
which would you choose i think you
choose to be happy
right you wouldn't choose the money over
the happiness
i don't think so
uh here we have this absurd situation
where we can measure people's happiness
apparently
we can measure it in some ways and it's
the most
important thing it's the thing we all
want it's the one thing we agree on that
being happy would be
a great outcome and yet we measure other
things
we can measure it we know it's the most
important thing
and we only measure other things
why why do we do that what is wrong with
us
that we don't measure the only thing
that matters let me ask you this
if you measure the happiness level of
i'll just pick two groups
asian americans and african americans
and you measured their
overall happiness just are you happy you
know just that question
how happy are you on a scale of one to
ten would they be the same
i actually don't know the answer to that
question my my guess
is they'd be kind of similar and
yet the economic uh outcomes are
completely different
that should matter but it doesn't um
there's another study that says that uh
fox viewers
are less likely than cnn viewers
to take preventative measures with the
crotavirus so
fox news people are less likely to wear
a mask
less likely to socially distance less
likely to want to close the business etc
and that's probably true i feel like
that's true
now here's another question which group
are happier
are fox news viewers happier
or are cnn viewers happier and isn't the
goal to be happy
right uh well if you do a little
research you'll find out that
conservatives
uh are happier and substantially so
than people who are not conservative so
it would be
actually accurate to say almost
certainly that fox news viewers are
happier
they're happier than cnn viewers and it
feels like that's true
doesn't it when when you just see how
people are responding to politics
doesn't it anecdotally doesn't it look
exactly like that it looks like the
the people on the left are literally
unhappy
it's not just about policy it's not
about preferences
they actually seem unhappy with life
whereas the conservatives
even when they're complaining seem kind
of happy in general
they're complaining and happy at the
same time so
if the goal is happiness should the fox
news viewers who don't wear their masks
as often
are they making a mistake or are they
doing more of the stuff that made them
happy in the first place
and they understand the risk and they
they know that there's a cost to it
i know measure all the wrong things
speaking of mental health
uh pelosi and uh and representative
raskin i guess they're gonna
promote maybe today this is happening
they're pushing a bill
to create a commission on presidential
capacity to discharge the powers and
duties
of office act um
so so pelosi is going to be pushing on
the 25th amendment
replacing president trump for
you know fitness for office i guess and
i'm thinking could that be a worse thing
to do
that's just about the worst thing i
could think of when you're only weeks
away from an election
because i don't know how long it would
take to do a 25th amendment thing
but i think we could wait till the
election now here's what i would like to
do
instead i do think that there are some
types of medications
this should automatically uh 25th
amendment
amendment to you now it might cause
presence not to take those drugs
which would be a problem too but i would
think that a doctor should be able to
say you know
this president is taking this
prescription drug
and this is on the short list of things
which if you're on these things
you ought to at least temporarily turn
over
you know maybe some of the big decisions
like the nuclear codes
if you turn that over to the vice
president just while you're on that drug
now that doesn't mean that you're
incapable of functioning
it just means you could be again it's
risk management
it doesn't mean you're there's something
wrong with you it just means you're
taking a drug
where it would be hard to tell and you
might do something
that would be too aggressive for example
i was just reading up on
president kennedy and how many drugs he
was on
president kennedy was on a lot of drugs
one of them was
a steroid did it make him more
aggressive
don't know one of them was on one of
them was ritalin
which was basically admiral of the day
so kennedy was on
performance enhancing drugs and he was
also
on something that might have made him a
little more aggressive
i'm not a doctor but i think that would
be fair to say
the steroids he was on might have made
him more aggressive
do you think that the cuban missile
crisis would have gone the same way
if he had been differently medicated
because it's pretty ballsy to tell
russia that we're going to launch a
nuclear attack
if they put some missiles in cuba that's
pretty gutsy
is it exactly what he would have done if
he had not been on steroids
we don't know we know it worked
so when we look back at it in hindsight
we could say well it worked
therefore it was genius therefore it was
good leadership
but we didn't know it would work right
did we know it would work i think maybe
we didn't know it would work
somebody says uh methamphetamines too
yeah they do have some effect so i don't
know if that's the right answer
but uh i'm not completely against the
idea that there are some medications
that should just
automatically take you off the
decision-making tree
and i base that on my own experience
with medications because there have
definitely been medications
where that made me more aggressive if
you're hearing my
my cat in the background she's making
noise
hey boo come on up here yeah
um i think one of the reasons that trump
canceled the debate
is not just because it would be a
virtual debate and that would be
that actually would be reason enough um
because they would be able to cut off
his microphone i don't think it's just
because
uh he didn't he didn't gain a lot in his
own debate
i don't think it's just because uh
i don't think it's just because of
anything i think it's just because
maybe he wants to make sure he's got a
little more time to recover
i think it would be smart for the
president to not
rush to a debate because imagine it's
the day before the debate and you're not
100
do you want to go up in the debate stage
not being a hundred percent
the worst thing that could happen just
the worst thing that could happen
so yeah i think he needs to be sure that
uh
that he can handle the debate and i
think canceling it for an excuse that
it's digital
that's a good play that's a good play i
think that's the right decision
um all right
so there you have it um
somebody says kennedy pulled missiles
out of turkey
i believe the story about what uh
what kennedy pulled out were obsolete
assets
so i think that what kennedy gave up to
russia was obsolete
what he got in return was taking
functional missiles
out of cuba so i think it was reported
in a way that could make russia feel
like they got something
but maybe they didn't all right that is
all i'll try to figure out why i don't
have sound on periscope and i'll talk to
you
