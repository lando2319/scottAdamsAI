[Music]
good morning everybody
and welcome to
that's right
the best day of your life
a highlight of civilization and possibly
the best thing that's ever happened in
any part of the metaverse
as far as we know
that's my claim and
look for a fact check on that
i'll bet you you will not see any fact
checkers
who consider that false so go to google
and
you know google fact check and see if
it's wrong
or
have they decided to let it pass
yes i believe it is the best day of your
life and all you need is a copper mug or
a glass of tiger chelsea stein a canteen
sugar flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine head of the day
it's the thing that makes that tingle on
the back of your neck
it's
yeah the simultaneous sip it's gonna
happen now watch what it does to you go
oh yeah ah that's so good
so good
it feels like a
a hike in the woods doesn't it
all right
um do you know what i like one of the
best feelings in the world
have you ever had a sneezing attack when
you were in a forest
you know normally if you have to sneeze
you're usually around people and then
it's this big awkward thing especially
during covet and you're doing the whole
and then you spray yourself and
the entire experience is very
unsatisfying
but have you ever been like completely
away from everybody
you're just literally in a forest
and a sneezing attack comes on and you
just let it fly you're just like
how do you feel
you feel good
it's like one of the best feelings
there's very there are few very few
times
when you don't have to
let's say respond to other people's
social pressures
but a good sneeze in the woods
that'll set you free you'll feel good
all day
so if you haven't tried that uh go try
that now
um here's a question that i've been
wondering what is the exact ratio of
fake news to real news
fake news over real news do the math
what would be the proper ratio
before you could be called a conspiracy
theorist
would it be
ten percent
suppose ten percent of the things you
said turned out to be
unfounded conspiracy theories
would that be enough
to call you a conspiracy theorist
about
50 percent
about 50
would you then be a conspiracy
theorist
suppose more than half of the things you
reported or talked about more than half
what if more than half of them were at
least
well let's say incorrect because of the
context they're given
would that feel like you should be
called
a conspiracy
theorist
well i don't know but the news today
is that um
several of alex jones's company i guess
three of
alex jones companies have filed for
bankruptcy now this is actually a legal
financial technique it doesn't mean he's
losing money
some people will read it that way
but uh he's been called a uh
conspiracy theorist by bloomberg and cnn
and i'm thinking to myself especially
cnn
well what is the ratio
are they claiming that he's got a higher
ratio of incorrect
news to correct news
maybe he does i'm not even judging
i i i've never done the you know the
analysis
so i don't know
but it begs the question doesn't it
what if both of them are squarely in the
category of well you know that's a
little conspiracy-ish
isn't it
you know
am i right or wrong that cnn pushed the
the russia collusion hoax
forever
i'm pretty sure they did i think i think
uh there were quite a few hoaxes that
they pushed as real
how many of the how many of the hoaxes
the cnn promoted did alex jones believe
ah what just happened to you right there
how many of the hoaxes
the cnn promoted and there were a lot of
them big ones
the drinking bleach oaks the fine people
hoax the you know the russians
bounty on american soldiers hoax
i mean it just goes on and on
but how many of those did alex jones say
well yeah i believe that story how about
none
how about none
do you get any credit at all
for being able to spot the other side's
conspiracy theories
right you know cnn acts like they're the
only ones who could spot a conspiracy
theory i'm pretty sure alex jones
spotted a few on them
pretty sure
and we're going to talk about somebody
else who spotted some
some sketchy behavior on cnn
in another segment
so
anyway uh just
so alex jones is responding i think
because he lost some lawsuits or one
lawsuit
uh about the sandy hook
story
so i don't need to get into that but he
made some claims that did not hold up
and
uh some people approved that they were
injured in in court they proved it
anyway at least to a jury satisfaction
so he owes lots of money to people who
claim to be victims of his
uh
so-called conspiracy theories at least
once one specific one
and
so when you file for bankruptcy
you're really just trying to give
yourself protection against a big
lawsuit or a big specific problem
it doesn't mean that he's cash negative
or that he's losing money
it just means he couldn't pay all of
that money all at once
or he chooses to find some way to you
know
weasel out of it
so it's more of a financial
financial technique the only thing we
can know for sure
is that he's not making so many millions
of dollars
that it's worth it to him to just pay a
few million to make it go away
so
so we don't know exactly what his
financial situation is but don't assume
that it's bad just because he uses this
financial technique that doesn't mean
that doesn't mean he's in trouble
financially
um
well how about this
a florida judge
just put the kibosh on um
[Music]
mask mandates
and at least the tsa for example is
dropping them and now uber and a number
of other places are dropping them but
they're not being dropped everywhere so
there are some cities that are keeping
them on local mass transit for example
and not all of the airlines have weighed
in yet but most of the airlines are
going along with
dropping the requirement
can we take a moment
i mean it's not over over
but it's
it's going to be
because you know the slippery slope
works in both directions right now we're
heading back to something closer to
normal
now
i never believed that we would have to
wear masks forever
did any of you
how many of you believed yeah
somebody
i'm seeing in the comments i don't know
if this is true but somebody say it was
a trump-appointed judge
was it a trump-appointed judge that made
that decision
is that confirmed or is that just a
twitter thing
a lot of people say yes
so
let's treat it like it's yes isn't that
kind of perfect
remember i i told you that one of the
prediction methods i use
is if things work out too perfectly like
a movie would work out
it might tell you you live in a
simulation but for some reason it
predicts
we so often end up in a situation where
that could only happen in a in a week
there's another one
i'll tell you later about one i got
wrong
um
so
i don't have much to say about this
except that
thank god
oh my god
and and by the way
congratulations to all of you
congratulations you know i know some of
you uh fought the mandates
and thank you
so for everybody who pushed back against
the mandates when it was really clear
you know once it became clear that they
were over applied
thank you
thanks for all the citizen pushback
thanks for
thanks for being on the right side in my
opinion
and thanks for being active you know at
least making your your thoughts known
that you know i've always told you that
i can't speak for other countries
but in the united states the the public
does run the government
we just sort of act like we don't know
it
the only thing the public has to do is
agree
if the public agrees they can get what
they want
we our system
pretty much guarantees it maybe not on
day one right but if the public is all
on one side solidly they're going to get
what they want so basically this is a
victory of the public
because who knows what the government
would have done on its own right who
knows
but but we do know that the public
pushed it until it broke
i mean i think that's just what happened
i think to put i i think that anybody
who makes a decision
to unmask
is doing it in the context of knowing
that the public has had enough
right it's going to get violent if it if
it goes too much longer
so
um
it took way too long but here we are so
let's let's at least celebrate the good
news that is by far not complete
and by the way
are you having the same
impression that i am
the the fact that the employees
generally you know the lower paid people
on the scale
of these big companies and restaurants
and stuff the fact that they still have
to wear masks when when the people
they're serving do not
is just grotesque
i i don't know why
black lives matter or anybody who cares
about you know the lower end of the
income spectrum
i don't know why they're not making a
bigger deal about that i mean it's it's
viscerally disgusting
i mean to me it feels like walking onto
a plantation and in the days of slavery
like like what it would feel to have
such obvious
signs of unequal treatment of human
beings
right obviously it's not like slavery
so before somebody goes wild and says oh
you compared masquerading to slavery no
no no no no
it's just an analogy
yeah settle down settle down
it's not the holocaust it's just masks
but in terms of the both of them giving
you a visceral feel
i don't know i can't get past it
and
and and tell me if this makes it worse
if you say somebody who's black
and underpaid
and wearing a mask
when you're not
doesn't it make you feel a little extra
creepy
you know maybe you shouldn't because
again that would be a bigoted
right it would be bigoted to have any
opinion about the color of the person
wearing it but you know we're still
primed that way
you know we're primed by
the news our own history of slavery etc
so you do see it that way at least i do
like it gives it that little extra
like what the hell are we doing like how
do we allow it
yeah how do how do the rich people allow
it honestly
like everybody should be complaining
about that
the the lack
i guess it more than other things shows
a lack of consideration
for other people
in such a
like fundamental way that it's just
disgusting
it's one thing if you say
you know i don't want to raise my taxes
to give it to other people
because that you can explain that in
terms of the system works better if
everybody has to you know look out for
themselves if they can if they have the
ability
but this isn't one of those times it's
not like there's any larger
system that's being supported by it
nothing's being supported by it's
literally just discriminating against
people who don't have power
that's it
it's just power
it's an absolute brutal
disgusting
disgusting use of power
anyway
um
so
do you all know who malcolm nance is he
had been until recently
one of the voices or contributors on
msnbc
um
if you don't know who malcolm nance is
the story won't be nearly as funny
but apparently he quit msnbc and he
joined the ukrainian international
legion
to go fight for ukraine
now
he was in apparently he's a navy veteran
i guess he was a linguist or something i
don't know if malcolm nance ever saw any
actions
could anybody confirm that
because
he doesn't exactly look like
at least if he was in the navy i don't
know if he saw any ground action
but
there he is pictured in his camouflage
he's got his little name there and he's
holding his his weapon
and
he said he just couldn't stand you know
reporting on it and and not doing
something
so he decided to go over there and do
something
and are you saying to yourself
somebody says he's 61 years old and that
feels about right
what do you suppose it is he's doing
over there exactly
i don't even know what to think of this
now the most logical thing to think of
it is not that he's helping ukraine but
he's maybe getting ready to write a book
you know he's trying to cash out on it
he's a fluffer or somebody says
intel gathering
cia stuff somebody says
i don't know
i feel like there would be a better way
to do almost everything
translation
as a translator
what languages does he speak does
anybody know what language is malcolm
nance speaks
um
you must he probably speaks a few
languages i'm guessing
anyway
i
i don't even know what to say about that
story all i can say is if you know him
and if you know the things he said on
msnbc
he is one of the consistently
crazy sounding people
like in a scale of one to
uh keith olbermann you know where
olbermann would be like the top of the
crazy scale
he'd be sort of a full of olbermann
you know some people would be like a
half oberman
but he'd be like a full old man
we'll talk about him a little bit too
all right um
let's see what else has happened
remember i
i told you that if you wanted to predict
who's going to win in ukraine
that the only number that matters at
this point would be the number of uh
switchblade and other drones they have
and i said if they have enough drones
and presumably they could train people
fairly quickly
to to use them i don't know how long it
takes to
if your if your life depends on it how
long does it take to learn how to use a
drone
a day i don't know so
uh 300 switch fade blade drones or be
sent to ukraine
so
how many switchblade drones these would
be things which can hover over a target
for
several minutes i guess or half an hour
or 10 minutes whatever it is and get a
really good idea of what's down there
before they dive down and destroy it
but they're they're suicide drones
so you get to use them once
but they're they're pretty good
but it's like it's sort of one and done
so now they have the ability to make 300
russian assets explode
including maybe some assassinations of
generals or whatever
would 300
successful attacks
change the course of the war
i don't think so
right now it wouldn't even be like a dot
because when the russians do these you
know bombing runs aren't they doing
thousands and thousands
you know but by the time russia is done
how many bombing runs will they have
made
like
30 000 or something it's like it's a
gigantic number isn't it because they're
just continually going
so it seems to me that if if the numbers
we're looking at is
uh hundreds you know the low hundreds of
of drones
then russia gets what it wants
am i right
somebody says they've done 1500 missile
strikes that russia has and the missiles
are just being a small
small percentage of the
the blow up stuff they're sending over
there
the the exploding stuff
all right
so this doesn't look good if i had to
guess without having any military
experience whatsoever which i think i
demonstrate every single day
i don't think that ukraine could win
without
five thousand drones
suppose they had five thousand
switchblade drones
could they win
i mean if five thousand of russia's
more important assets blew up
i don't know
that feels like that would start to make
an impact
if if they were the right assets at the
right time
suppose they used all of them to take
out their supply lines
would they just rebuild them as fast as
they were being destroyed so it wouldn't
make any difference
maybe
but i feel like you could stop an army
with 5 000
successful drone strikes
no
if you took out the right stuff because
remember it doesn't matter how much
stuff russia has
it only matters how many of it you have
to take out to the whole deal
and that would be a much smaller number
if you chose correctly
so
uh
so somebody is
pointing out that my military expertise
seems to be limited to how i feel
and you are correct
but you agree with the basic idea right
the basic idea is that some number of
drones is definitely not enough
but some number of drones is definitely
enough
and it's definitely not 300 jones is
enough
i don't think you have to be a military
expert to know that right that's
definitely not enough
but it's five thousand
now i don't know that the answer to that
question but
i don't know
i don't think anybody does right
so he says so you have no idea what
you're talking about yeah i do
i know it's really hard to stop a
switchblade drone
and i know the 300 is not enough
and i know that logically
some number would get you anything you
want
so i mean that seems fairly
straightforward
now of course if russia wanted to win
badly enough it probably wouldn't matter
how many drones there were they would
just level ukraine
all right let's talk about uh
this weird five-year lag between trump
sounding crazy and trump are proven
right
so i saw a tweet from jim jordan
representative jordan
and he said the ci the cia knew as early
as 2017
five years ago that the trump-russia
collusion data was not technically
plausible and was user created both of
those in quotes so those are based on
the actual investigation that's not just
jordan's opinion
that's what
the investigation has
turned up so far
and i thought to myself is that i wonder
if that rule of thumb will hold
that about five years from the time
that
trump says something's
you find out that it was
because here are some of the other
things when was it that trump first said
germany would be hostage to russia's
energy policy
around
five years ago
now it's not when he first thought of it
but it's when he first said it in public
and got mocked let's say
right about five years ago
uh how about
the idea of making the united states
energy independent
right he was saying that around
five six years ago
about china being our biggest problem
and needing to you know get business out
of there and be and and be tough with
them on business and stuff
about five years ago
uh how about
all the noise you made about the border
being important
about five years ago
[Laughter]
everything about crime about five years
ago when he first started talking about
everything
basically all you have to do is take
take trump minus five years and you can
you can find out
everything that's uh important and big
so here's something i have some
questions about there's apparently a
hashtag slash movement
called dark magga
hashtag dark mega
it involves themes in which um
trump-related images are being treated
as you know just red and black
scary-looking images and
i've heard it described and i have a
real question here so here's where my
skepticism
is turned up i've heard it described as
a movement that's waiting for trump to
return to seek vengeance on all those
who
hurt him or were republicans i guess
now
certainly there are plenty of
republicans who have that mindset
can't wait for trump to get reelected
and
but you know the swamp didn't get that
cleaned out last time did it
i don't remember a lot of swamp draining
going on
not a lot of that happened
in fact the swamp drain to trump is
looks like what happened
uh but this is how uh
it was described by one tweet
um was this cnn i think cnn said this
behind the movement
this dark mega movement they're calling
it there's no single identifiable group
or a clear ideology
g-net whoever that is said many of the
messages posted by dark magus supporters
incite violence and contain misogynistic
and or racist comments
dark magga
now you might remember that in 2016
i called out the word dark as something
that was probably expert made
and i had guessed that maybe you know
robert cialdini
who has advised democrats democrats for
president in the past such as obama
they probably somebody like him came up
with that
because it's so sticky you can make
everything fit into it it's like oh
trump said this well that's kind of dark
oh a republican said that oh that's a
dark image and and that if you just get
this idea of dark in people's minds
dark just brings with it all the scary
stuff
right
so
um
it seems to me it would be a branding
mistake for pro-trump people to use dark
in their
branding
now
i think it did work in the case of
deplorables
and if you're black in america
it probably does work to use the n-word
as sort of you know owning owning the
word that was so painful in the past so
you can take something that was used
that used against you
and flip it around and use it as a badge
of you know strength or something i
guess
so sometimes you can do that but i don't
think this is a good application of that
in my opinion
the maga people if they wanted to win
should stay as far away from the word
dark as they possibly can
because what is the biggest
issue
that uh anybody who might be a little
bit
you know independent on this what is the
biggest issue they have with trump
that he's
scary and dark and
you know he just scares the crap out of
people
the way that trump won the first time
was by being super provocative and
aggressive
is that the same way he would win the
second time when the polls have him
beating everybody already we're doing
nothing
he doesn't have to do anything and
apparently he's ahead in the polls
should he use the same strategy of
ultimate provocation
well
it depends if he if he can adjust
strategy to fit a situation have you
seen evidence that he can
he can radically change his approach
to fit a new situation
ah
yes and no
it's not really clear
trump is famously flexible
i mean he used to be a democrat and then
he became a republican right that's
pretty flexible
but that's also historical
you know once you become president and
you you got there doing a certain
technique it's kind of hard to stop
doing the thing that worked
even if you think it might be time to
you know destroy your old self to build
a new self for the new challenge
you end up fighting the last war the
same way or you end up fighting the new
war
as if it were the last war it's it's one
of those human
human let's say impulses
i would call it a failing except that
it's sort of universal we all do it
you're always fighting the last war
let me let me put it out there if if
trump could act any way that works
and he were not slave to his past if he
could be anything that would just be
good what would be by far
the number one thing that would get him
elected for a second term
number one would be
play nice
because his his followers would know
what he was doing they'd say oh i get it
he's just playing nice to get elected
but he's still trump
you know once he gets elected he's gonna
still do all the things he wants to do
but he could radically change the way he
talks about things
talking about the border he could simply
talk about
the pressure it's putting on the
low-income people at the border
the pressure is putting on black
americans and just leave it at that
he doesn't even have to make a big deal
about building a wall
he doesn't have to because his case is
already won
when he started out with the whole wall
thing
in my opinion it was brilliant
persuasion because he was trying to make
a big impact and draw all the attention
to him on that subject but he succeeded
now everybody understands this whole
border thing is a problem
stop arguing
you know this is a classic case where
you don't want to
sell past the clothes
trump has the close
he closed the sale
without trying after office by leaving
office and showing that the alternative
to trump's policies were a disaster he
closed the sale
he can let the press do it for him
he should now stop selling
stop talking about a wall
because that will only piss people off
build the wall sure
yeah yeah sure build the wall because he
already won that argument
you don't need to argue the thing you
already want
just you know quietly start it up again
if somebody asks you
and they would ask are you going to
rebuild the wall
the proper answer is not build a wall
build a wall
you know
jail hillary clinton
that's just old
the new answer should be
we should do a variety of things that
work
but yeah i think the border was border
wall is important to beef it up in areas
where we have a special problem over
time maybe we could get the whole thing
walled but we certainly want to do
whatever works as quickly as possible to
get it under control
am i right
because who's going to argue with that
at this point
because even the democrats agree with a
little bit of wall makes a difference
even they agree with that
so just agree with the democrats say
it's a huge problem
and everybody knows what you're going to
do about it
they'll know he's gonna do the same
thing he did last time there's no
mystery you don't have to rub it in you
don't even have to
make a big deal about how right you were
because
it's just in front of everybody they can
see it he would make a big deal about it
so
um
now
trump's big asset is that he could
absorb all of the energy from the press
so if you were doing that again
is that still the right thing now
because i think you got too much energy
really
you know maybe you could tone down the
energy and you still you still out
energy the other side by a mile
well uh here's another thing trump was
right on
so
the murder rate in america is way up but
it's especially shocking in black
populations so the black american murder
rate shot up 43 in 2020 so the beginning
of the pandemic and
when there was a lot of
black lives matter stuff so
after the black lives matter movement
it's stated and very clear intention to
improve the
impression of you know the value of
black lives
and also to improve their situation and
to make it especially
more than anything especially safe in
terms of police and you know physical
safety
but the outcome was exactly the opposite
and in a big way
that the murder rate uh just shot up and
the
the black on black crime especially is
through the roof
it was trump right that
you know keeping the police well funded
and doing what we used to do would be
better than
defunding the police
probably so
probably was right
all right um
let's talk about twitter rasmussen did a
poll and uh
39
of uh american adults believe it would
be good for twitter if musk bought the
company so 39
are on musk's side about buying the
company
22 percent think it would be bad for
twitter
now i think a better question would be
bad for america or good for america
but bad or good for twitter is an
interesting way to put that
all right but 26 think it would not make
much difference if the richest man in
the world
whose intention is to change the lever
that moves
uh all of free speech which is really
the operating system for
civilization
uh 26 think that uh that wouldn't make
much difference
no no no only the most impactful
entrepreneur
of our lifetime
um who's got a stated goal of really
really changing things and already has
his teeth into it
um
26 percent think that's not going to
make much difference i mean
how much difference could it make if
elon musk
owns the company
what has he ever done
that surprised you right
26
26
if we were to round that
it's about uh
carry the two it's about 25
25
i think elon musk wouldn't make much
difference if he bought twitter
for those of you who are just joining us
i always point out that 25 of people
polled get every answer wrong
i don't know if it's the same 25
i worry that it is
i i'm concerned that it's always the
same 25 but i'd like to think it's a
different 25 for each question
well
so there's a as i tweeted cryptically
there's sort of a an i am spartacus
thing happening right now
and if you know the reference from
movie spartacus
uh spartacus was hiding among the slaves
and when the
the romans were asking for the spartacus
to stand up because they didn't have
they didn't have facial recognition back
then so they couldn't tell who was
spartacus in this crowd of slaves
somebody who was not spartacus stood up
to accept whatever punishment spartacus
would have and they're like okay you
know i guess if you say you're spartacus
kabir will kill you and then somebody
else stood up
and then slowly everybody stands up and
they're all spartacus
so
you know it was kind of like famous
movie scene
and i'm watching what i would call a
subtle spartacus movement
in which people who have tremendous
influence
in society but not they're not elected
it's just people whose opinions
are going to move your opinion more than
other people
they're starting to
emerge
you know i i i told you that neval has
just sort of very subtly weighed in and
said of course we're going to fight
over over twitter of course we're going
to fight
he didn't say was signed he's on
because he he doesn't
he famously is not aligned left or right
but
do you think he's against free speech
do you
do you think he's against free speech i
don't think so i don't think so
uh but the most surprising one
jack dorsey
it wasn't surprising that the news says
that joe rogan is strongly backing
uh musk for buying twitter you weren't
surprised at that
but interesting that it's a major story
right
because joe rogan's influence and
credibility is now so big
that the fact that he endorses somebody
for a specific action
isn't is national news
i mean who wants who else does that
how about bill maher
bill maher
is also pro-musk in terms of buying
twitter
interesting isn't it i guess he's
spartacus too
so um
but the most interesting spartacus
is uh jack dorsey
who on twitter of all places
has now insulted twitter's board of
directors for their competency
competency
um
so there was a there was a post by
somebody else uh in which the user
equipped
that the company's early beginning was
mired in plots and coup among among its
founding executives and uh i guess jack
dorsey uh liked that
but then he gets a little back and forth
with brian selter stelter of cnn
and
um
and he also talked about how uh
cnn had faked a news
report in ferguson and jack dorsey was
there and watched it live so he actually
was there in person in ferguson during
the the riot situation there and watched
cnn trying to incite some some trouble
to get it on camera
and
i i would imagine that's the sort of
thing that changes you so here's what's
news about it
first of all
uh to have jack dorsey uh publicly
criticized the board of directors of
twitter as the problem with twitter
and somebody asked them are you allowed
to do that and he said succinctly no
are you allowed to criticize the board
of twitter
no
and that he did it
it's i am spartacus it's basically a
whole bunch of people who are just done
they're just done
they're done with
being gaslit by everyone
right it's it's not just fox news it's
not just cnn it's just everyone
just everyone's gaslighting everyone and
and there there appeared to be some very
influential people who are just done
they're just done with that so yeah i
can't say this okay i'm gonna do it
i can't endorse this guy i'm gonna do it
anyway
bill maher i can't endorse somebody
who's you know not all on the left well
i'm gonna do it anyway
so there are so some spartaci that's the
plural of spartacus if you didn't know
so the spartakai are starting to line up
um i'll i will add my own
you know tiny spartacus influence to say
i'm 100
behind musk buying twitter 100
i don't have even the slightest
reservation about that one
um
and i would argue that there's nobody
really really smart who disagrees with
musk buying twitter
or at least i haven't seen one
so i've seen people
you know i've seen
max boot say it's a bad idea
you might see some people who are purely
political say it's a bad idea but you
can't count that they're just being
purely political
but
tell me
just show me somebody who's sort of not
famously political an independent
thinker with an iq over
140.
it's pretty high bar
show me somebody who's a history of
independent thinking an american
with an iq over 140
who has any problem with musk buying
twitter
i'll bet there are not many of those
i bet they're not mine
let's take
let's see
warren buffett
haven't heard from him i don't think
he's
made any comment right i'm not sure he
will but do you think warren buffett who
is very clearly in the democrat
uh realm
do you think that warren buffett if
asked would say it's a bad idea for musk
to take over twitter
i don't know he might make some general
statements about
you know billionaire control of the
media or something but
i i've got a feeling he would not be
against that
i don't think anybody above a certain iq
with a history of independence i'm not
talking about somebody who's actually a
politician but people with a history of
some independent thought i don't think
any of them are going to be on the other
side
could be
wrong we'll see
so the other thing that jack said
jack dorsey
you tweeted at
stelter because stelter was criticizing
carlson tucker carlson
so
brian stelter of cnn goes after tucker
carlson in a quote
and said tucker carlson is always
selling the same thing
he's selling doubt and i think he was
pointing to somebody else's article on
that
so he's selling doubt
and then jack dorsey responded to that
tweet by saying and you all are selling
hope
now
how many of you how many of you believed
that jack dorsey was just you know he's
just a democrat and probably pretty
aoc-ish
and that's it so that's how you
understand them he's just he's just a
democrat how many thought he was just
he's just way over there in the left
i don't think that's ever been true
but let me give you a little test
who is the person who is most publicly
uh been saying and for for years now
has been saying that twitter should
change its algorithm so that the users
have an option
of what to do with it so it's not up to
the company what you see who is the most
famous person who has been criticizing
twitter's algorithm for the last several
years
jack dorsey
jack dorsey is the most vocal
you know at least you know noticeable
person
who's been criticizing
twitter's algorithm
and the way they do it
and
how long was he still at twitter when
that change was never made
have you been watching that because the
first time you said it i thought oh
obviously they're working on that now
because the ceo doesn't say we need to
do this
unless they're working on it because
it's just software
i mean
certainly within the
doable category of things right
but then jack dorsey leaves and
criticizes the board
it sounds like we're finding out maybe
one of the reasons certainly not the
only one
but we might be finding out one of the
reasons he left
it might be that he had a problem with
twitter's free speech management
and that he had suggested an obvious way
to
to address it
very obvious
the obvious way to address it is to let
people choose their algorithm and just
make it obvious what they get if they
choose it
and he got ignored
well i don't know if ignored is the
right word but he was not successful in
getting that at the company he ran
and then he left
so
i feel like the board
may have this is just speculation based
on your reading from the outside which
is pretty dangerous
but the speculation is that maybe the
board
prevented him from fixing the company
in a way that any reasonable person
would think was a good idea give people
control over the algorithm
how in the world do you argue against
that idea
i've never even heard anybody argue
against it have you
have you heard a counterpoint to that
suggestion oh no
don't give users full access to the
algorithm that would give them exactly
what they asked for
who exactly is on the other side and he
still couldn't get that done
that tells you everything doesn't it
and i think that's why he's
he's going full
spartacus i think he called his time
exactly right
because with musk's
you know move on twitter this is exactly
the right time
for an independent thinker
who i will surprise you by telling you
he is
surprise he's an independent thinker
and
um he pulled he called his he called his
timing perfectly this is exactly the
right time to do it
so watch that space that's going to get
better
better and better
um i love
as much as i don't like the black mega
meme
um i suppose people who are doing it
probably just like the the look of it
it's kind of you know it's kind of
awesome looking but i would back away
from anything that could be used that
easily against you
um
however
i'm seeing the phrase covidiens used a
lot
by the people who were mocking the
people who were too afraid to
drop the mandates mostly in the masks
but
colin
you remember the branch
davidians in waco they were a splinter
christian group you know
yeah
i guess i don't know what to call them
but it was a religious
group sort of a cult
but
calling the uh people who were afraid to
take off their masks the mask covidiens
is just so clever like it's not it's not
really persuasive
i don't i don't think i mean not in a
way that matters because people are just
going to do what they want to do now so
you know i'm not even sure persuasion
matters
okay
so i'll just say that i love that
branding the mask covidiens
all right and
that ladies and gentlemen concludes my
prepared remarks
again
one of the all-time
most insightful and greatest things
you've ever seen in your life
and
it makes you feel good too
where else can you go
to become smarter and better looking at
the same time
almost nowhere almost nowhere you don't
think i could make you better looking
do you think i could use persuasion
to make you
better looking
does anybody believe i could do that
i could do that
it's easy
because people who are confident look
better
it's that easy
so hypnosis can make you more confident
do you know one way you can do it
to tell you you look great and you look
sexy
and you've never looked better in fact i
can tell that you've improved your
workout since the pandemic i see you've
taken it up a notch
you're looking not only sexier but more
confident
i've noticed that your
your posture is
better now
spend a little time today to improve
your posture while you're walking
just when you're walking somewhere
just
just improve your posture
and watch
how you're better looking and it's only
because i suggested it that made you
think of it and then you thought of it
and it was easy to do and you just stood
up a little straighter and as soon as
you stood up a little straighter felt a
little more confident
and people looking at you thought to
themselves well you're a little more
attractive
so i just persuaded you
to
look more attractive
literally
that just happened
now not every one of you in some big way
but again it's the law of big numbers if
there are a number of people who watch
this
some substantial number of you will
think oh i will put my shoulders back
and i will i will straighten my spine
and tuck in my butt
and you will actually be more attractive
so sometimes these things are not that
hard to accomplish
so that was your
i guess that's your treat for following
to the end have you noticed that i
sometimes put the most useful
uh bits at the end
oh it's it's part of my technique
to make you addicted
and it's working
that's right
now if you don't believe
that me simply telling you through the
screen that you're sexier and better
looking
will work
then you haven't learned yet enough
about persuasion
because it doesn't matter if you if you
regard the persuasion as true
it matters if you hear it a lot
that's it and you're hearing it because
this format
is what i call a mass personal
experience
so it's a mass broadcast to lots of
people but it's weirdly personal isn't
it
and because it feels personal because
it's me talking to you
and i'm telling you that all you have to
do is
straighten up your back and
and act a little more confident and
other people will see you that way
it's going to have more impact than if
it was something you read in a magazine
or something because of the nature of
this it makes it it will it will make
your brain act as though it worked
oh
here's the freakiest thing are you ready
for this this is something that
i may have discovered something but i
want you to test it
because i only i only have one anecdotal
experience please test this it goes like
this
you have to sneeze
back to the sneezing thing
but you can't let's say you're someplace
you don't want to sneeze
last night the cat was on my chest i was
really happy he was kneading into the
blanket and stuff and i didn't want to
sneeze and scare her off
and so i was trying to
work her into the idea that a sneeze was
coming
by starting small
if i could hold off the actual sneeze so
i started this way i went
at you
and she didn't move and then i went
at you
she still didn't move
then i went ah
and she still didn't move and i thought
okay now she's primed
because when the real one comes it's
going to be a little louder than that
last one but maybe she's now used to it
as something that doesn't hurt and the
next one will be like ah it's you but
you know what happened
my fake sneeze
made my urge to actually sneeze
stop
instantly
and i said to myself
oh my god i'll bet that could actually
work here's the hypothesis
the hypothesis is that this disease is
forming in your brain
not your body
and that if your brain was satisfied
that you had sneezed
it would turn off the impulse
and i believe that my fake artificial
sneeze
turned off the switch to make me
actually sneeze
so here's what i want you to test the
next time you have a sneeze coming and
you're sure it's one that's going to
happen do a loud fake sneeze
assuming you're somewhere where you can
do that just go ha shoe
and try to sell it but it's definitely
not a real sneeze
watch what happens to the real one
if it turns off
it's gonna blow your freaking mind
like it did mine last night now i don't
know if this could work for me again and
i don't know if if it was just a
coincidence
but i've never stopped to sneeze before
have you
have you ever stopped to sneeze
i mean the closest i've ever come is
like that
kind
but i stopped it cold like it was a
deafening sneeze and it just boop gone
somebody here says it works
all right so
you need to test that for me and forget
i'll forget that i asked you to do it so
test it for me
the first time you get a hit on it if it
works
you have to message me or put it in the
comments or tweet it at me or something
because if this works
it's going to change everything you
think about everything
and it might work so that's your
test for the day and youtube i will see
you tomorrow
