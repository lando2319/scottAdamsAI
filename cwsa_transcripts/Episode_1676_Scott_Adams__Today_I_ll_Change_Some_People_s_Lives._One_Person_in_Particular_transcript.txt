[Music]
good morning ladies and gentlemen
today a special treat
you know normally this is the highlight
of your entire life
coming to coffee with scott adams but
today
i'm going to take it up a notch
somebody's life will be changed today
is it you
well i don't know probably not
but somebody's life is going to be
changed and
in the process of doing that
most of you
are going to become more powerful today
do you think i can deliver on that
i'm going to make most of you more
powerful like you're actually going to
learn
a life skill or more
that will make you more
effective
but
before we do that would you like to be
primed with the simultaneous sip that
makes everything better
of course you would that's why you're
here then all you need is that copper
margaret glass a tanker chelsea steiner
canteen joker flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine hit of the day thing that makes
everything better
and yes that's a white board behind me
yes that's how good today is no cheating
don't look ahead
and now go
oh yeah
um
all right let's do a little uh
little audit
of my audience
in the comments please tell me
if you identify as
a liberal conservative or
let's say
neither or independent whichever you
prefer
so in the comments i just want to get a
sense
conservatives and independents
libertarians
indies conservatives
so apparently there is no one here
there are literally no liberal people
watching this
or nobody wants to uh
to label themselves as such
all right
all right
uh how many of you
have voted have ever voted democrat
all right new question
yes or no how many of you have ever
voted democrat
a lot of yeses
and that that's interesting because a
lot of you said independent so if i
hadn't seen a lot of yeses i would have
been disappointed
although the number of no's and nevers
is kind of impressive
i don't know if that's a good way or a
bad way
all right
so uh that was just a little audit of
who i'm talking to here now i tweeted
today that
it seems to me
that if you prefer methods and systems
that work
that are known to work
somebody will label you conservative
and i think that's what happened with
trump
i think trump's philosophy if you will
is
well what works
we know what everybody wants right we
want to be
safe and wealthy and happy
you know educate our kids and have
freedom and all that so everybody's very
clear about what people want
but
you know we're less clear about to get
there i always thought that trump was
all about whatever works
and then people said well you must be a
conservative
because they just assume that if people
are doing practical things that might
work
they're probably conservatives and i
think he embraced it and
just ran with it
but
in my case i don't i don't label myself
as conservative or liberal or anything
else
i mean not really i always say i'm left
of bernie but that's just to confuse you
um
i always find it's a compliment when
somebody calls me conservative
although i don't label myself that way
it seems like if somebody calls you
conservative they're saying
yeah
you're one of those people who keeps
trying to do the things that work
traditionally such as
building systems that take into
account the competition and
and human motivation matter
okay
i'll take that hit
let's put the dilbert filter on the news
and see if it makes anything look
different now the dilbert filter
would be
if you've worked in a large organization
of any kind
there's some things that you see over
and over again that you wouldn't
necessarily think are true
unless you actually experienced it
there's some things you think well is
that just
something people
make comics about
or do those things really actually
happen in big organizations
and i'm here to tell you
yes those things really happen in big
organizations and you can't believe any
of it unless you experience it that's
why the dilbert comic was a phenomenon
in the 90s more than now
because
because i kind of outed the fact that
people were having incredibly weird
experiences
but nobody nobody seemed to be talking
about it publicly
because i think people were under the
impression it was just them
well this must be just my job that this
can't possibly be happening all over the
place
and then what i outed was the fact that
yeah it's happening all over the place
as soon as you put a bunch of people
together in any kind of an organization
there are certain things that always
emerge
it's just really reliable if that were
not the case the dilbert comic would not
have taken off it was people saying oh
yeah that's me nobody talks about that
but that's happening
so let's put that same filter on the
news um
one big part of the news today says that
the russians are promising humanitarian
corridors
so that the you know the non-combatants
could escape safely out of the combat
areas but
uh the news is that they're being
attacked and or the roads are mined
and so that the russians are being
cynical
and they just say you can let you human
let your civilians out but really what
they want to do is kill the women and
children too
because killing the women and children
will get them like an extra quick
victory
so that's what the news says
here's the dilbert filter on the news
what are the odds that the people who
are attacking the roads and or mining
them
are in perfect communication with the
people who say yeah you can have your
safety corridor
do you think there's only like
you know one one combatant unit or or do
you think that they they all have a good
communication
do you really think that the people who
said yes this you can have this corridor
to escape do you think they knew
anything about the corridor that they
had just authorized do you think they
even knew if their own forces were going
to attack it
do you think they knew if it had been
mined
maybe
maybe you can't rule out that the news
is right
it's possible
but hold this thought because i'm going
to come back to it right
now in my opinion i would i would say
that this kind of news is
notable wouldn't you
it's notable when somebody says i'll let
you out and then then kills you instead
that's very notable
remember the word notable
because i'm going to tell you later
that the fact that that sounds notable
means it's probably not true
we'll get to that
how about another one here's the
the dilbert filter on
what caused the war
now there are a million ways to slice
this and say what caused the war
is it because
putin is a megalomaniac
maybe he's declining and wants to leave
a legacy
maybe just russians always conquer
anything they can conquer if they think
it's easy
so there are 100 ways to say what caused
the war maybe maybe nato expansion
you know poked the bear too many times
and had to respond right how many ways
could you come up with
to describe what caused the war
a lot right
you know that russians will have
their interpretation europe probably
will have their own etc
but let me put the dilbert filter on it
and this is based on the fact that
there's this uh one head of the military
in russia who is known to be
let's say a favored star of putin
uh also i believe he had no military
experience before being head of the
military i'll need a confirmation of
that but i don't think he'd been in the
military
and apparently he's he's reportedly a
big suck up
so he's somebody who's going to tell
putin what putin wants to hear
apparently one of the things he told
putin
was that he had upgraded the military
and that military that russian military
wow
first rate
so here's what i imagine is the
conversation that could have happened
in any large organization where there
are bosses and underlings
and and it's starting to look like this
might be the entire reason
that ukraine and russia are at war
and i'm quite serious about this
this is based on the dilbert filter
because
a deliberate way of operating is just
universal that's that's why dilbert is
well known
here's how i think it went
i'm going to say the boss
you can substitute putin in this and
when i say underling you could
substitute
um
sergey shoigu who is the head of their
defense
and the boss says
to his subordinate
he says hypothetically
could the russian military you told me
you modernized conquer ukraine
and then the underling says
two days tops
and that's exactly why
some say you should give me a medal and
maybe a raise
not only if i modernize the indus my the
military in ways which are hard for you
to confirm
but
that military is the finest military in
all the world you know when i took over
the job
not so good
not so good honestly the the guy you
executed just before me
i think he did a terrible job but not me
with the limited budget that you've
given me and the limited time to
implement it i have completely turned
around and modernized the russian
military so much so that nobody would
dare
get into an actual war with us
you know i wish i wish they would i kind
of wish they would
because if anybody got in war with us my
modernized new military that i did for
you mr putin
we would wipe them out so thank goodness
thank goodness we'll never be in an
actual shooting war but you know what um
i think it would be a
good for the country to show that
the person you put in charge of
modernizing the military
did a great job
it'd be great for morale in the country
i think it would send the message to the
rest of the world as well
so
i don't know another medal i'm thinking
something in public
possibly a small raise to
our bonus whatever you like could be
crypto i don't care you know real estate
adacha in the country anything anything
i'm i'm not even suggesting it i'm just
saying that some are saying
some people are saying that the way i've
modernized that military
wow uh it would be almost uh
a crime
to not recognize that sort of thing
given the benefit to the rest of the
country not even i'm not even thinking
of me
it's we
it's we
not me
and then putin says
really you've modernized the military
that much
and his general says yeah
i did
and he says well if you can conquer
ukraine in two days
go do that
and then as general says
what
yeah you heard me go conquer ukraine in
two days you just told me you could do
that yeah yeah
well yes well that's true
in some ways you could say that i did
say that
but
in other ways you could say that
diplomacy is another tool of war and no
you just told me you could conquer
ukraine in two days
conquer ukraine in two days or i'm gonna
cut off your testicles and feed them to
you in front of your wife
what
yeah you just told me you could conquer
ukraine in two days go do it
and then a war started
that's what i think happened
and every day
this general is probably going back to
putin
holding his balls
with one hand
and waving his other hand trying to
explain why things aren't going well
well you know
if it hadn't been for the your head of
propaganda getting ahead of things we
would have surprised them
but you had to use your you know as
president xi
if president xi had not
asked you to delay for the olympics i
swear
we would be all over kiev by now
all over it but then that delay
gosh that you know nobody could have
figured that into the planning when i
built this modernized military it was
really more of a blitzkrieg model bliss
creek
i expected to be in and out two days but
when you made me wait a week you know
everybody got prepared
everybody was prepared
what was that on me
i told you i was ready to go we were
ready to go one week we were ready to go
you made us wait six weeks
six weeks everybody had time to buy get
new weapons
you basically not you no i'm not
believing you boss no
she
president xi
you know we are the victims here you and
i
we are the victims our our military
would be so done by now if not for
president xi
but sometimes you got to do what you got
to do
so that's what i think caused world war
iii
speaking of horrible things the
blaze media is reporting
they did a foyer request i guess
and they revealed that uh
hhs health and human services so our
government
purchased all kinds of advertising from
the major networks
about the vaccinations
so abc cbs and nbc as well as cable tv
fox news cnn msnbc legacy media new york
post ellie times washington post blah
blah blah blah blah blah buzzfeed max
news facts
so the government bought advertising
on news shows
to or news networks
um
to tell you the public that you should
get vaccinated
they use your own money to
to tell you what to do well i guess
that's what governments do they use your
own money to tell you what to do so that
part's not surprising
but when you were watching these news
networks did you think you were getting
something like
oh i don't know
the news
because i don't think you can really say
you got the news
i think that
if somebody is paying you to say
positive things
you're probably not going to say
positive things
on the commercial
that they paid for i mean that part
would be recorded of course
and then give a news segment saying you
know these guys are a bunch of liars and
crooks
because how much more additional
advertising dollars are you going to get
if you say that your advertiser is a
crook
none
so can you trust anything that the major
news networks told you about
vaccinations
now i think uh fox news did pretty at
least the opinion people
were at least skeptical about the
vaccinations they they expressed
a level of skepticism not everybody but
some of the some of the hosts
so you know you can you can see that
some of the opinion people were not
affected by the advertising
or were they
would they have gone harder
did they stop short of where their
actual opinions were we don't know
we will never know
they may have stopped short of where
their actual opinions were
well um
but none of that surprises you does it
well the biden administration announced
they're going to do some kind of
executive order looking into how to
regulate cryptocurrency
well that's all good news isn't it
that's all great news
because if there if there were ever two
things that you wanted to put together
to make synergy
you know
people like crypto
and they like governments
so if you like cryptocurrencies and you
like governments you know what would be
great
you put those two things together
sure
some people say cryptocurrency is
the antidote to government
but it won't be soon
as soon as they get their regulations on
it
now
honestly i'm not smart enough to predict
where this even goes
the most
the most uh let's see scary future
is that the government gets control of
everything privacy crypt crypto just
everything you know your bank
and then they have full control and they
can just push a button and turn your
life on or off if you don't cooperate
that feels like
reasonably
uh
possible or probable enough that you
should worry about it but it's not the
only way things could go
i've often
predicted
that the worst place for society to be
is
semi-lack of privacy
the two worst
the worst place it could be
would be everybody has complete privacy
because then you could be a criminal
complete privacy means you can just do
anything you get away with it so
complete privacy is you don't want you
want some kind of you know moderated
middle ground
privacy you think
but what happens when the citizens lose
their privacy
but the people in the government have
not
that's the worst case
so we're very close to the worst case
scenario where the citizens have no
privacy about anything
but the people in charge still keep
their privacy so if they punish you for
no reason
it's hard to prove because they've got
their privacy you don't
so
if you got to the point where the people
in charge had no privacy
this by the way is something that naval
noodled about years ago he called it the
uh the gopro presidency
you know where the president would have
to wear a gopro camera all the time you
know maybe except using the bathroom or
something so you see i just see
everything now that's you know a uh a
visual way to express a bigger idea
which is you know greater transparency
of the leaders
yeah it takes away blackmail
takes away
i mean takes away a lot of things
anyway
uh i do not predict uh either doom or
glory
oh
kind of a
problem oh god
okay
all right i'll deal with that later
uh rasmus into the poll on election
integrity issues
and it looks like election integrity is
going to be a pretty big issue in the
upcoming elections in the us
so more than half of uh voters
believe cheating affected the 2020
election
so it was 52 of them i think said that
it's very or somewhat likely that
cheating affected the 2020 election
and surprisingly
19
of democrats
agreed with the notion that
cheating affected the election
now are you surprised
how do you explain that 19 of democrats
think cheating affected the election
now remember i'm talking about affected
the election
but in which way yes somebody got the
right answer
everybody thinks that the other team
cheated
so i'm surprised that the democrat
number isn't actually higher
and my guess is that it would be higher
except the democrats know they don't
want to say the election was stolen
19 of democrats are just answering the
questions straight
well do you think there was cheating
that affected it 19 said yeah probably i
mean probably both ways
probably both ways right
the the most
the most reasonable assumption about
this big complicated system where
different states are running it would be
yeah probably
and probably in both directions we just
don't really know the extent of it or
what just no way to know
now
what if
what if trump had won in
2020
would the same number of people on each
side
say they thought the election had been
stolen
the percentages might be the same but it
would it would flip parties
so basically i think all we're finding
out is that if the other side wins
you're pretty sure that their cheating
was involved
does anybody disagree with that
the independent of whether or not any
cheating ever happens
if the other team unexpectedly wins
you're pretty sure there was some
cheating going on there pretty sure
doesn't matter which way it goes
all right
here's a
interesting uh answer
um
well no that wasn't interesting never
mind
but let's talk about something that is
um
is photo id a reasonable measure that
was another question rasmussen
uh 74 percent of the public thinks that
having a photo id is a reasonable
request to vote
that would leave uh let's see how many
um or would be against that let's say
uh you take a hundred
and you subtract the 74.
so somewhere around a quarter oh quarter
25
um yes
so 25
ish
ish of people
think that uh people should vote uh
whether they're citizens or have id or
nothing i guess
all right
now
let me ask you this
don't you think we should have some kind
of rule of thumb like you should have a
name so everybody can refer to it when
there's something that over let's say 70
of the public supports
and they can't make it into law
what what do you think of something
anything it doesn't matter what the
topic is doesn't have to be about
elections but what any topic
in the united states where over 70
percent of the people support it
and it isn't being made into a law
how do you explain that
doesn't it have to be corruption
now the exception would be
the exception would be if your
um
let's say credible leader said look i
realize that most of you want this
but i'm going to give you a good reason
why you don't want this
i'm not really seeing that
i'm just seeing the usual you know lies
coming from both sides usually
so is either cognitive dissonance or
corruption and i don't know how you tell
the difference
it's a tough one
because we don't know we don't know how
much corruption is involved
so that's just always a question mark it
looks like cognitive dissonance but it
could be just corruption or it could be
both it could be both actually the most
likely is both
all right uh are you watching the little
tweet war between uh representative eric
swalwell and richard grinnell
ambassador
ex-ambassador i guess to germany
so i guess there's a photo
let's do this in the order it happened
so swalwell tweets this he says i'm old
enough to remember when richard grinnell
palled around with nazis
uh while serving as our ambassador in
germany
now what did i tell you about
notable
news
things that really make you go what
what
are you telling me
that the american ambassador
to germany
was was paddling around with a nazi
while he was an ambassador to germany
wow
do you think it's true
of course not
of course not do i even have to tell you
why it's not true
no
you should know it's not true
just by listening to it
just listen to it
just say it in your head and hear how it
sounds of course it's not true and as
richard grenell points out
uh in his response on twitter he said
to swalwell did fang fang tell you that
because she got you again it's illegal
to be a nazi in germany
you'd say you can't even be one
here
the person he was pictured with so he's
in a photo posing with somebody is a
member of the bundestag
representing the afd
and he came to the fourth of july party
like every member of the bundestag
but i guess this guy had done something
provocative years ago
uh
but it was more of a prank or something
but whatever it was
swalwall turned it turned him that guy
into a nazi so they could try to turn
grinnell into a nazi but you should have
seen that one common
you know as soon as swalwell made that
claim you should have said
american ambassador to germany
publicly hanging around with the nazi
in germany
probably not
probably not
the big
i guess four of the biggest accounting
firms have announced that they won't do
business in russia anymore
and so i ask you what's going to happen
to russia
and here is my multi-point prediction
for the russian economy are you ready
predictions for the russian economy
now
can anybody predict
economics
not really
so when i give you a prediction the way
you should see it is well this is one
way it could go
but nobody can really predict economics
it's kind of a crazy thing to do
so use your judgment i'll just describe
one
i think probable future
but it's only one of them one possible's
future
so number one you see the accounting
firms are pulling out what happens when
credible accounting firms
uh are no longer willing to say that
your firm is doing its accounting
credibly
well companies basically buy the
credibility of the accounting firm
even though they often lie to the
accounting firm so the accounting firm
often does
nothing but the books they don't really
know the truth of the company but it
gives sort of a credibility to a company
that at least the accounting firm is
honest
that's the one thing you can depend on
they may have bad data from the company
but at least they're not lying because
they have a your reputation to uphold so
when the credible ones leave
you're left saying should i do business
with this company
or can i even believe their books
so it turns it turns every company that
was a little bit credible in russia
into not credible at all
and remember economies run on psychology
so that's a big deal
if you can't trust the person you're
working with you don't
you work with somebody else you can
trust if you have options and we do
then what about the insurance companies
who are looking at russia and saying you
know
we could insure you if things stayed
exactly the way they are
but we can't tell if things will get
worse in terms of more sanctions
so we're not even going to touch the
things
that have been carved out from the
sanctions
we you know we can't do the things that
have sanctions on them
but we can't even do the things that
don't have sanctions on them because
they might have a sanction someday
and we're the insurance company and we
work on
you know risk
so we can't get near that so if you
can't get credible accounting
and you can't get insurance for ordinary
business activities
you're in real trouble
and that's where they are
then you've got
the russian banks
and the credit card system is going to
use china as their bank basically for
the processing so all the chinese
the chinese banks and therefore the
government
of china will have all of this private
information about russian spending
that can't be good
because persuasion depends on knowing
what people are doing
if you know what people are doing you
can persuade them
so that's a real
security problem for china or for russia
to have china know that much about their
citizens
number four uncertainty will cause
domestic spending to drop
unless inflation causes them to
overspend and inflation gets you
but if you don't know what's going to
happen tomorrow you're less likely to
buy stuff because you think well i
better save my money for
buying food because i'll need all of it
for that
so if domestic spending drops the
economy starts to plunge
uh we already see per uh the net worth
of companies in russia is basically zero
because you couldn't even buy one
we'll get rid of the
the bad jewels who are doing a bad job
then
then you've got
western buyers of russian
energy the people who we think have to
buy russian energy
we don't really have to buy russian
energy
because it turns out that the rich
countries aren't going to run out of
energy they're going to pay more
it's the poor countries
that can't pay more
and there won't be enough if there's a
limit so the poor countries just won't
get any
am i wrong about that
as long as the price of energy is you
know very
fun you know very
flexible
the rich countries like the united
states will get as much oil as they want
we'll just pay twice as much
and the poor countries will just starve
so i think that's what's happening
but
um i do think that uh the com the
western countries and europe
will find uh
we'll find ways around
russian oil
because they can
there's lots of things you wouldn't do
unless you had to
but the
depending on russian oil is a little
like this
have you ever worked in a company where
you had an indispensable
employee and then they quit
and then you found out well it turns out
they weren't that indispensable it was
just in your mind
how many has had that how many of you
have had that experience
or you're in a relationship and you
think it's sort of indispensable to your
life
like it's got some problems
but it's indispensable there's no way i
can change it
and then something happens and it goes
away
and you're you're sad for a while and
then a year later you're like well that
wasn't as indispensable as i thought
it turns out very few things are
indispensable
but we think a lot of things are
i think russian oil is not that
indispensable to europe
no they could find a way it's just kind
of hard but they could do it
and
that would of course make the energy
from russia
basically captured by china so china
would be the main buyer and that would
give them all kinds of power over russia
because china eventually
won't need that power
and they could get it from other places
too and build their building nuclear
power plants like crazy and
i assume
looking for sources in other places
so
it's terrible to have one big customer
because that big customer owns you have
you ever heard this saying
if you borrow a million dollars from a
bank
the bank owns you
let's say that a million dollars is a
lot in your case if you borrow a million
from the bank the bank owns you because
if you don't pay it back they can cause
a lot of trouble for your future life
but
if you borrowed 10 billion dollars from
the bank
you own the bank
because they can't afford to
they can't afford you to
bail out on that loan
right it's bad for you but it's way
worse for them they can't lose that 10
billion dollars
so
um when china becomes the biggest
customer of russia
china will effectively own russia in the
same way that you could own the bank by
borrowing too much
um
russia is going to have inability to get
new parts and ability to get new
technology so eventually you would
expect the efficiency of all russian
industry to disintegrate
if you can't get parts and you can't get
new technology
stuff's going to rot it's just going to
fall apart over time
look at venezuela we're down there
looking at their oil but you look at
their oil industry and because of the
sanctions they can't even produce oil
venezuela barely can produce oil
and has tons of it but the sanctions
make it almost impossible to operate the
equipment
so that's where russia's heading
then
i'm not even done it's getting worse
then the russian military spending will
exceed the economy's ability to support
it
because they'll be bogged down
in ukraine they'll have to keep their
military big and just like reagan
destroyed the soviet union
uh once again putin will destroy russia
because the military will suck up
whatever is left of the economy that
will be shrinking
until the whole thing just collapses
just like the soviet union
and
at that point uh china which basically
would own russia
by then
would install a puppet regime
yes i'm saying it
the next leader of russia
is likely to be a chinese puppet
and
because by then
russia's economy which would be so
feeble
that chinese money could bribe anybody
in china in russia
do you see how that works
yeah as the russian economy shrinks and
shrinks and shrinks
and china is a bigger and bigger gets
bigger and bigger itself but also is
more and more of their only customer
china's money and then their their
friendly connections to them
allows china to directly bribe
literally everybody that matters
in russia over time
and then they just install a puppet
so after putin is a puppet it's a
chinese puppet but it would be a puppet
over a country that barely is barely
there
i don't even know if the united states
will be less safe it's hard to say
and then russia itself would become
irrelevant over time because the only
thing they had going for them was their
military that china would largely
control at that point and their energy
which was dirty energy and you know
green energy and other suppliers would
be filling the gap by then
so russia would be you know continue to
just
become irrelevant
and then putin would be remembered as
the second russian leader to destroy
russia
by prioritizing the military over the
economy
the destruction of the soviet union was
the prioritization of the military over
the economy
putin's doing the same thing
and when he does the same thing
everybody who is a historian is going to
say well you should have seen that
coming
if you prioritize your military over
your economy
you're screwed
did china do that
did you see china prioritize their
military over their economy
i don't think you did did you
i feel like china actually has a
smallish military compared to what they
could do
if they wanted to go you know just full
military
right
so it seems to me that russia that china
got it exactly right
it seems like europe is getting it
exactly right relying on u.s firepower
to a large extent
but it looks like russia is making the
same damn mistake
that the soviet union made prioritizing
military because
we must conquer countries and strength
is what matters
looks like that's what happened and so
putin is looking at you know the worst
possible outcome for him i think
now i guess putin has offered
four conditions for ending the war
do we think he's serious
uh
help me with the four conditions if i
because i'm going by memory
um i think we have
that to uh
ukraine and everybody else i guess has
to recognized that crimea is part of
russia
which it effectively is
we have to
agree that the independent regions the
two independent regions are independent
i guess
and then
ukraine has to put into its constitution
no nato involvement ever
and was there a
oh and then the then the ukrainian army
had to stop fighting
and putin says if you just do those four
things which on paper sound almost
reasonable
almost if you just do those four things
we'll stop fighting immediately
now
and demilitarize i guess
but no that doesn't sound serious at all
to me does it sound serious to you
because first of all
all he has to do is say the ukrainians
are continuing to fire at us
that's it it's exactly the same thing he
says all the time his most common lie
is you're shooting at us first
why would that change
it worked every time he's used it if
there's something that works every time
you use it
why would you expect them to stop using
it
so if one of the conditions is
we russia have to claim that the other
side stopped shooting at us that's never
going to happen how long would it take
ukraine to change their constitution
while their country is at war
probably can't be done
so he's asking for something that sounds
easy hey just put that nato thing in
there
probably can't be done like physically
timing-wise just couldn't be done in the
time that it would affect the war
right and and then the uh
giving recognition to crimea and the
other thing really don't change much
those two just sound like
i think those are the fake ones
because you say to yourself wait a
minute
russia's asking for two things that you
know you really understand they want
control over those regions and then they
could complain they could they could
credibly say
we all we did was uh um denotify it i
mean that's not what they were doing but
they could credibly say all we wanted
was these regions and then they would
just keep consolidating ukraine over
time any way they wanted
so
that's that's a
non-starter all right
here's my promise to you i am going to
change
some of your lives i'm going to change
one person's life
in particular
you want to play along
help me change one person's life in
particular and in so doing
it will help other people
in their lives i was looking through
twitter and i came across a twitter
thread by a gentleman i don't know
anything about
he goes by the name gurwinder
and
i'm going to recommend him as your
follow
i'm going to tell you one of the things
that he put in a 40-point thread and in
his thread he claimed this
he said
in 40 tweets i'll explain 40 useful
concepts you should know
it'll take you less than seven minutes
and he said the value would be
potentially a lifetime
do you think he delivered
now remember i don't know anything about
him
right but do you think he delivered on
this claim 40 tweets
and he would teach you 40 useful
concepts that basically would have
potential change your life for a
lifetime
he actually did
he actually delivered it now
uh i'll tell you you know the actual
name to follow in a moment
but um i'm not going to read the thread
to you i'm just going to tell you that i
looked through it and i said to myself
um
and i said to myself it does look like
this is useful stuff
and i'll give you one example
which
ties to this
uh first of all the individual
the if you do a search on twitter
search for a g
u r winder g-u-r-w-i-n-d-e-r
which i will point to
with my back scratcher
g-u-r-w-i-n-d-e-r or at g underscore s
underscore b-h-o-g-a-l
all right so his his life we're going to
change
because we're going to send him a lot of
followers
now the reason i'm sending him a lot of
followers
is that i look through some of his other
tweets
and they're actually
really good and useful here's one
example
and i would say that i recognized most
of the things he was teaching
but you could get a good idea how good
your awareness of the world is by how
many of the 40 things you've already
heard of
if you haven't heard of all 40
maybe you should
all right here's one of the claims the
more notable the data the more likely it
is fake that's what i introduced early
in the live stream and i've talked about
this before
scott alexander that's a pen name not a
real person
introduced this the first time i ever
saw it
it has to do with the fact that ordinary
stuff it doesn't make news
so something has to be incredible
such as
how about the russian army will give you
a corridor for the women and children to
escape but then they're going to bomb
and mine the
corridor that would be
pretty shocking
if it were true
and so
we don't know if it's true by the way it
could be true
but it's probably a 90 chance against it
because of this rule if you don't
understand
that the more fantastic the news the
less likely it's true
you will go through life being just your
head your head will be on fire
because
your head will be on fire
because you'll think the news is true
it's not
but because the news likes the click
model whatever gets the most attention
gets the most uh money
uh that leads to a point where
eventually all news will be fake
not really all news but you know what i
mean the political news
the political news will trend toward
either completely fake or at least stand
of context
it has to
because of these effects
that the more the more notable stuff is
usually fake
that's the stuff that pays so in the
long run there's just no way to avoid
this in the long run all the news has to
be fake
about political stuff and also maybe
scientific stuff
as a political element to it
how do i know this is true well the gel
man amnesia concept confirms that this
has already happened you've heard it a
million times but i'll tell it to you
again did i spell it wrong
2l's in gel
i almost looked that up before i put it
here
i knew one of you would correct me
is there two ends
all right
um but whatever it is however many l's
and n's there are the gel man amnesia
states that if it's a topic that you are
an expert upon
you'll know that the news is fake
for example
i'm an expert on
dilbert things
dilbert things
and so when i heard that russia gave a
corridor for escape
and then bombed it
i said my to myself maybe
maybe but in all my dilbert expertise
that sounds exactly like somebody's just
not communicating with their own team
which is just the most normal thing in
the world
doesn't mean i'm right
but it does give you an extra vision
into things
statistically speaking
and so
um
this is this would be one of the
concepts
that you'll see in this 40 tweet thing
you can go follow
gurwinder or you can follow
if you follow me you can see his tweet
in my
thread so here's what i'm going to say
to you i believe that he that he came
through with his promise i believe that
in seven minutes
and i'm gonna for the people who
subscribe on locals
you should treat this as just a given
you should go read this
you know i i teach all these micro
lessons on the subscript subscription
platform on locals
and what i do is a little video lesson
where you can learn you know a life
skill in two or three minutes but
gerwinder did this
with 40 things that you can learn in
seven minutes so he topped he topped me
and i thought i was doing pretty good
but he definitely topped me
now you've seen long threads
and sometimes they're fun
but this is actually the most useful one
i think you'll ever see so
the first life we're going to change
is
the gentleman
i've been talking about
who
deserves more followers
because if you can boost his signal
it will help useful messages such as his
last thread get to more people and you
can see from his twitter feed that he
has lots of useful stuff
so
um yeah if
i also saw some interesting data
that at any given uh night
fewer than one percent of people watch
the news
like the you know the tv news
and that if you were to find out how
many um how many people in the general
public are following any of this stuff
it's almost nobody
you know we're we're living in the
smallest bubble
all of you and and i
only 25 of people tweet
or have twitter i think it's 25
yeah
and i think people are also realizing
that the news isn't real
[Laughter]
if there's one thing that would stop you
following the news it's a realization
that it's not real anyway so you have to
wonder what your what your net gain is
now in my case
since what i talk about is fake news
for me it's a target rich environment
but i'm not sure why other people watch
the news
how's the news media still in business i
just explained it
the news media is still in business
because people really get a dope i mean
hit reading fake stories
if it gets you going
it gives you a little little treat a
little uh little reward you're gonna do
more of it so that's all it takes you've
been you've been trained like a chicken
working for pellets
that's it that's the whole news business
now is chicken and pellet
let me explain the entire media model
chicken
pellet
that's it
yeah tucker has 4 million viewers and
land with over 300 million
well i will quibble with your number
uh yes there are 300 well 370 million or
whatever um
but if you take out the kids
and you take out the people you know or
like in comas and people who don't speak
english and you know
you can whittle that down quite a bit
and then you
and then you limit it to people who pay
attention and
form opinions for the other people
it turns out
that i don't think there are more than
[Music]
let's see if you agree with this i don't
think there are more than a hundred
thousand people
who make all of our decisions
what do you think
now it might be a different hundred
thousand
depending on what the topic is but
largely the same ones yeah the overlap
is like mostly the same ones
and here's why
most people are repeaters of opinions
they're not they're not people who
formed an opinion because they did their
own work
so that 100 000 are all the influential
people who did the work
and so
you know the the the few who did a lot
of work
you know the uh
glenn becks and the hannities and the
rachel maddows and
chris hayes and everybody else so the
people who did the deep dives
inform the hundred thousand
and then the hundred thousand become
like evangelists in a sense because
they're the ones who really really have
opinions so you go to a party
and there are five of you there and uh
four of you never heard of the topic but
one of you like really paid attention
and that person influences the other
four because they're like well i heard
that one thing
you know this this guy
said that one thing that sounded pretty
good to me i didn't hear the other
argument but this sounded good my
neighbor said it
so i think it's a hundred thousand
people that affect everything
which means
if i ever got to a million viewers on
this platform
i would
probably you would see my influence just
everywhere probably
so it's a good thing i don't
i do have a hundred thousand subscribers
but not a hundred thousand viewers daily
all right that's all i've got for now
um would you agree
that i have changed
many of yours lives and one person in
particular
have i
have i satisfied my claim
yes or no
of course i did of course i did
the people on locals are happier
or more generous
the people on youtube
you should see the difference
yeah uh well okay some of some of you on
youtube are being more generous and i
appreciate you
i appreciate you every day all right
so um
some of you i hope it changed your life
and uh
that's all for today and i'll talk to
you
on youtube tomorrow
