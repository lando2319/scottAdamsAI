I love that stuff
good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that ever happened to you
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
it's big all over the world
possibly in other planets because I
think they're monitoring our activities
and if they are they certainly would
have picked up on this pretty quickly
so if you'd like to do something that
the smartest sexiest people in the world
do every day
and at least probably one or two alien
civilizations who are monitoring Us From
a Distance it's called the simultaneous
Sip and it's going to happen now and
aren't you lucky yeah you're lucky
because you made it in time because live
it's the best and all you need is a
copper mugular glass a tanker chalice or
Stein a canteen Geographic a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
my goodness who is contacting me
um
and join me now
for the simultaneous sip
it's the dopamine of the day the thing
that makes everything better including
your antibodies I should have said
especially your antibodies and it
happens now go
antibodies going online firing up
a few extras looks like they've joined
them yeah looking good looking good
well
here's something that surprises the hell
out of me honestly I was quite surprised
by this so I was watching Bill Maher's
show or a clip from it on Friday where
he was brow beating Sean Spicer who had
been one of Trump's spokespersons for a
while
and was trying to get a Spicer to admit
that the the election was fair
and that there was no fraud
now uh I think Spicer did okay you know
he he did okay in his answers but could
have done a lot better
a lot better because it turns out
that Bill Maher and this is amazing
think about how well-informed Bill Maher
is compared to the average person
average person how well informed they
are Bill Maher is literally his job to
be well informed on politics it's his
job
and and he's good at it and he is more
well informed than most people
and it's I think it's even a hobby right
following the news so if you would
expect somebody to be well informed it
would be Bill Maher on politics right
Bill Maher actually seems to be unaware
that the courts never really looked at
anything of substance
they looked at whether the issue could
be looked at by the court which is
different than looking at the issue and
when they said ah this you don't have
standing or it's too late or whatever
the reasons were but if you took if you
took everything factual that course
actually ruled on
and compared it
you compared it to all the things that
could have been a problem or or were
discovered later or alleged to be
problems later
at what percentage of the factual claims
do you think courts ruled on
what would be your guess
of all the claims that were made
before and after court cases you know
did things
of all the claims that let's say the
claims had some a little bit of
legitimacy to them doesn't mean they're
right but but enough legitimacy that a
course should decide what percentage of
the total claims do you think courts
actually ruled on
I don't think it's zero most of you are
saying zero I don't think it's zero
but it's less than 10 percent
probably wouldn't you say maybe 10
percent
and then here's another question what
percentage of all the places that fraud
could hide potentially
in an election what what percentage
of all the things that could be checked
in a perfect world were actually checked
40 maybe if you did a full audit in
places that you suspected problems what
percentage of all the things that you
want to check Could you actually check
I don't know the answer that
but my sort of sense of it is maybe 40
it's definitely not 90 percent and I'll
tell you what it's definitely not is a
hundred percent right because they had
no access to any of the electronic stuff
did they I don't believe they had access
to the source code I don't think they
had access to the you know any records
about the databases you know once it
left the paper the paper world I don't
think they had much of anything
so uh it is not my belief
that there is any convincing evidence of
fraud
I know you don't want to hear that
because you want me to say that I've
seen it and it's there I haven't which
is different completely different from
saying it's not there
I'm saying that nobody could know a
fraud is there it's unknowable it's also
unchecked nobody checked and nobody can
know so
uh and and really this isn't even a
story about the election this is a story
about how somebody whose job it is to be
well informed about would you would you
say this is the biggest topic right now
can you think of a bigger topic
than January 6 and the election
Integrity what's bigger than that
climate change I guess maybe depending
on your point of view
but
one of the biggest political stories and
the most I would say this the central
most important fact is how much was
checked would you agree with that
statement this the most Central
important fact of the entire story of
the election and the entire story of
January 6. the most important fact
is what percentage of the stuff you'd
want to check was actually checked it's
the biggest question
if you don't know the answer to that
even in a general sense
you don't do anything
you literally don't know anything about
the topic
am I wrong
if you believe that a hundred percent of
the claims had been checked and were
disqualified
nothing like that happened not even
close
in no world did anything like that
happen and yet Mars entire world view in
this seems to be based on an assumption
that courts looked at evidence
you know the the best of it or most of
it or or even a lot of it
nothing like that ever happened
the courts decided they couldn't rule on
it one way or the other because you know
they didn't have jurisdiction or
whatever it was didn't have standing
didn't have jurisdiction well you know a
bunch of technical reasons
all right um
I've told you before in my opinion that
of all political pundits there is one
that is dumber than all of them put
together
and his name is Joe Lockhart now I don't
know if Joe Lockhart is smart when he's
not on television
because he might be
uh you know some sometimes it's hard to
tell when somebody's legitimately dumb
and when they're just being partisan
because when you see somebody acting you
know purely partisan they kind of look
dumb don't they
am I the only one let me ask you this
uh
yeah yeah I see your comment Eric
um
so anyway Joe Lockhart
uh he tweeted this
and
I swear to God I'm not making this up
this sounds like something I made up as
a joke
you know because I I called him dumb and
then I'm going to read a tweet that
sounds dumb
I didn't make this up I didn't make this
up
he actually tweeted this
he said you know who also had coded
statements like Brandon
Isis the clan Nazis
beginning to get the point
that's right
Joe Lockhart compared the the humorous
chant let's go Brandon
to the same techniques of Isis the clan
and Nazis and then concluded that they
had a lot in common
um and I said you know so he thinks that
maybe this coded statements thing really
tells you what's happening
because people are talking coded
statements
probably are associated with terrorism
or Nazism or Isis
um
that's Joe Lockhart's point and he was
proud enough to put that in public
but I would like to defend him this time
all right although I've been a Critic
I'd like to defend him in this one case
so before you judge this tweet harshly
I want you to at least consider
that it wasn't a real tweet
but rather a coded statement of his own
I'm just going to put that out there
because if it's a real tweet it doesn't
make any sense at all
you'd have to kind of at least be open
to the possibility he said to you a
coded statement
not not meant to mean what it looks like
it means
and if it is a coded statement uh
that would make him no better than Isis
the clan Nazis and according to Joe
Lockhart Republicans
poor poor Joe Locker I hope that's not a
coded message I hope it's just as dumb
as it looks because if it's a coded
message my God his soul is in trouble
well
what could be more perfect
than a president who had been labeled by
his competitor Mr Trump
as sleepy Joe
falling asleep in public at the climate
change Summit in Glasgow what could be
more perfect
sleepy Joe falling asleep at a climate
Summit
nothing that's right the answer is
nothing nothing could be more perfect
than that
now
the longer that Trump is out of office
what if I told you what was my
prediction the longer he's out of office
the smarter he's gonna look
right
now when he when he decided of all the
things you could call Joe Biden of all
the possible nicknames
Trump reached into the void and picked
out sleepy gel
and damn it if if Joe Biden didn't fall
asleep in public more than once right
how does Trump do this seriously
how could you be good how could you be
so good at this giving people nicknames
the stick
it's crazy isn't it it's crazy how how
he reached into all the possibilities
and picked out the one who was perfect
um and I'll say more about that topic as
well
but I'm wondering this so you've got a
climate Summit does it make sense that
the climate Summit would have nobody
invited who is a climate change uh
skeptic or a doubter
do you think you should have a climate
Summit with no dissenting opinions at
your summit
is that is that reasonable
I think so I think so because their
entire claim is that the the downers
should be ignored
so I would say it's consistent with you
know their overall theme
to not invite them but here's my further
question drilling a little bit deeper
down
there are people
uh notably there are people who believe
climate change is real just as they do
but believe maybe the approach to it
should be a little different or a lot
different than what we're doing Michael
schellenberger for example believes that
climate change is real that the science
about it is you know directionally
correct but that the from an economic
and logical standpoint we may be
approaching it in a sub-optimal way was
he invited
no I don't think so how about Bjorn
lombork also believes that climate
change is real directionally speaking
but doesn't believe that the uh
that the Panic about it is warranted and
has some ideas about that was he invited
no you know it's one thing it's one
thing to not invite people that you
consider not credible
but who doesn't think these two are
incredible
seriously
who are the people who are who are
criticizing either Bjorn lombborg's
approach which is mostly the sort of
business economic way of looking at the
risk and reward or Michael
schellenberger's uh Deep dive into the
fact that some of the Green Technology
is overrated and has its own problems
and that you really can't help poor
people without energy you know some
basic basic points about how to manage
this if if to this is what what they
agree on
why don't they get invited
it's because they don't they don't uh
they don't fit with the Panic narrative
so this isn't really a climate change
Summit is it
it's a manufactured Panic Summit
because if it were about the climate
they would invite credible people who
have let's say I wouldn't even call them
I'm not even sure I would call them
opposing opinions
they're almost additive opinions I would
say we're almost clarifying opinions or
at the very least they're productive
that let's just call them productive
opinions could turn out that maybe you
know their opinions are off in some ways
but they're productive
I mean they're bringing up the things we
should be talking about and we should
know if they're reasonable and and
sensible
so I would say that the you you almost
can't call the climate Summit if they if
they have not invited voices of that
type it doesn't have to be those two
people but they're the most successful
I'd say
um
so it's just a it's a panic I I would I
think you'd have to call it propaganda
wouldn't you just just propaganda if
they don't have that
all right um Robbie suavez I don't know
if I'm pronouncing his name right so AV
yes anyway he writes for a reason and uh
he's uh got a article about the Loudoun
assault Lou down assault now I'm going
to talk about the the skirted boy
allegedly assaulting the the student in
the women's bathroom now that's the
story and then there are details below
the story Etc
um
when I heard the story
I said there's something BS about this
story this this is fake news
and the reason I gave is that it was too
on the nose oh really there's a trans
student attacking somebody in the
bathroom exactly when that's like in the
news that when we're talking about those
bathroom policies exactly then that's
when that's when the attack happens if
it's like so I said it was fake news
so it was fake news
was I right
well let's do a deep dive and the answer
is yes and no
so don't get too excited until you're my
full explanation you might be you might
be satisfied with the full explanation
but you know until I get to the full
thing you might be unhappy
uh so here's what I understand so the
daily wire had a story and then that
story got enlarged to the larger
right-wing media for the most part and
you need to make a distinction between
how the daily wire covered it
and how it was later interpreted by
social media and Fox News hosts Etc
all right can you make that distinction
one is the daily wire story
was that accurate or not accurate and
then there was how the public
interpreted it and then the other media
my understanding is that the daily wire
story was a factually correct does
anybody disagree with that
does anybody disagree that the daily
wire story
was factually correct it didn't have as
many details as we've learned
now I'm seeing somebody say I'm moving
the goal post hold that thought hold
that thought that's a good thought
so that's exactly where your brain
should be right now you should be asking
if I'm moving the goal posts
that's the right that's the right
thought okay behold that thought
all right so
um so I'm not aware of anything in the
daily wire story that was incorrect are
we good now what Robbie Suave says is
that the uh the right leading media got
it wrong
so when he says the right-leaning media
he's not talking about just that one
outlet that started with the story he's
talking about you know the larger
interpretation of it Etc I agree with uh
Robbie that the larger interpretation of
it is uh misleading
and I'll tell you why
which is different from did the daily
wire cover it correctly in other words
the things that they knew at the time
are they accurate as far as I know yes
anybody is there any disagreement on
that as far as I know I don't know
anybody's uh I don't believe anybody has
criticized the accuracy of it just that
we've learned new things since then
okay
um so here's what we know the kid was
the alleged assailant was not trans
he was not trans he did have a skirt
and he was known to wear a skirt but he
was not trans I think he was gender
fluid or something
the bathroom policy was not in effect
when it happened
that's important so the fact that he
wore a skirt
had nothing to do with his access to the
bathroom does everybody know that
did you know
did you know that the fact he had a
skirt
did not give him access to the bathroom
how many of you knew that because it was
two weeks before they would even make a
decision about trans access to the
bathrooms
how many of you knew that
that wearing the skirt had nothing to do
with his access to the bathroom in fact
the two were they were either something
like a couple or a thing because they
had used this exact same woman's
bathroom in the past
for hookups
so this was not a random assault it was
somebody who had a relationship a sexual
one with the person who allegedly was
assaulted still makes it an assault
right the fact that it's a relationship
or had been a relationship isn't related
to whether it was an assault it's just
context
so the skirt had nothing to do with it
and he was not trans but as the daily
wire
wait hold on
we'll we'll get to your criticisms of me
in a moment but the the daily wire did
not claim the kid was Trans Am I right
the daily wire story never said the kid
was trans
you said it was about
gender fluidity and that maybe the
decision about the trans access to
bathrooms they didn't the the accusation
is that the administration didn't want
to mess up that question
and so they hid they hid the uh
then they may have might have tried to
hide the assault so it didn't interfere
with the separate question because
people would confuse the issues
right now I don't know about that nor
did I have an opinion on that now can
those who have been watching my opinion
did I ever express any opinion about the
policy change or anybody hiding anything
about the policy change or the fact that
the administration should have done more
you've never heard me talk about that
right
you never heard me talk about the
details the only thing I said when I
heard the story is
this is not a story about a trans
uh assault in a bathroom
the part that I will say was correct
is I knew The Narrative of it was wrong
that the story of a trans student
assaulting somebody a bathroom didn't
happen so that was my take my take is
that the central
belief of it that a trans person had
assaulted a let's say a random person in
a restroom wasn't true
so I could tell that that wasn't true I
did not have an opinion about the
cover-up which apparently happened
I did not have an opinion about the
father father's Behavior
I have an opinion I just wasn't
important to me like it wasn't important
enough that you hear it
um I didn't have an opinion about
um gender fluidity being important to
the story
because it was
I didn't have an opinion about
most of the parts of the story
so if you're saying I'm moving the goal
post remember I wasn't even talking
about most of the story nor did I have
any criticism or objection to it I had
one and only one objection
that on the face of it
it probably wasn't a story about a trans
attacking a random person in a woman's
bathroom
um
now how many want to disagree with my
characterization of my own opinion
go because I know you will oh I want to
see if how many of you think I moved the
goal posts
to to I don't think you said that BS you
re you originally said no skirt
correct okay that's a good comment so I
originally said I doubted there was a
skirt involved and there was a skirt
involved but that was uh the larger
context was doubting that there was a
trans involved
but one but the skirt part I'll take
that as wrong
all right
no you didn't disagree okay looks like
your comments are not very productive
they're sort of generic but I'll move on
so I'm going to say that I sniffed out
that story as being incorrect the way it
was interpreted
so what I didn't what I did not
criticize in fact I never read
is the daily wire story so a couple of
the reporters for the associate one
investigative reporter
uh and somebody else associated with
that defended their reporting
I think either from Robbie or defended
it against my tweet but I don't think
they need to
I don't think they need to defend their
story because I don't think the story
was incorrect
it was what we knew at the time
okay
all right
um
Colin Kaepernick has a
special in which he compares the NFL
draft to slavery
may I make
a criticism
anybody would anybody like to hear me
criticize
not just Colin Kaepernick who I think
has some good qualities by the way I've
said good things about him in the past
and I like the fact that he's uh I like
the fact that he's a rebel
I like the fact that he's got balls of
steel
I like the fact that he's not afraid of
anything apparently there's a lot to
like about this guy even if you don't
like you know his larger deal
can we agree and by the way I like to do
this as often as I can as I can manage
it to say good things about people that
I'm also going to criticize
because I think it goes down better
right
so he's uh you know talented and
um
and he's Brave and I think his topic is
important even if you disagree on the
details of it
but here's some other stuff I I think
just has to be mentioned
as someone who identifies as black
that's me
um I don't know if you do no no that but
I self-identify as black
and so that gives me a little bit of
something in common with Colin
Kaepernick because I believe he
identifies as black
um and like me some people might quibble
about his self-identification but guess
what
it's not up to you
that's the beauty of self-identification
Kaepernick can say that the the black
part of his identity is his main
identity and we accept that
and I can say that I identify as black
for the benefits I get from that and
you're gonna have to accept it it's just
up to me it's not up to you that's just
the rule
I'm sorry so I relate to Colin in that
way because we're both probably
criticized for not being black enough
but
um here are some my comments about black
leadership
why is it that that black leaders
in America are so bad at it
is it the media is promoting the wrong
people
because people become famous because the
media decides they're famous right
do black leaders become black leaders
because the black population wants them
to be leaders
or do they become leaders because the
media sort of appoints them
because I feel like the White media is
appointing leaders for the black public
and doing a terrible job of it like a
really bad job of it
here's the problem with Colin Kaepernick
I don't think he understands that he's
supposed to be influencing
white people
right I mean primarily he'd like to
influence everyone but don't eat don't
you get the biggest bang for the buck if
you're looking to fix I don't know
whatever
structural racism Violence by the police
whatever you're trying to fix you're
going to need to influence a bunch of
white people to get anything done
and I'm not so sure he's the best choice
for that
number one
um
you should not keep your name Colin
if you want to be taken seriously
because
Colin makes me think of colon every time
I read it am I the only one let me check
on this in the in the
in the comments when you see somebody
named Colin c-o-l-i-n
do you not immediately think of an
in the comments go
am I the only one
let's say
okay I'm seeing some yeses some knows
same with Colin Powell yeah Colin Powell
every time I heard the word like colon
oh interesting so a lot of you I'm
saying yeses but a lot of no's
huh
I guess it's just me there are enough
yeses that I think my point stands which
is you should change your name
immediately if you're trying to be
influential influential
um I'm only half kidding about that I
probably would have changed my name if
that was my name if that were my name
all right uh
the other the other thing is if you want
to be taken seriously
don't don't have clown here
right now I know Trump has Trump has
unusual hair too but Trump's unusual
hair you know seems still within the
realm of
you know haircuts he just has an unusual
one whereas Collins is clearly you know
a branding trademark kind of thing and
you know he's he's gotten down to
enormous
um enormous size now on one hand it's
really good it's really good
for standing out is really good for if
you want to stay in the public eye to be
different in some way visually visually
being different is actually a pretty
good strategy
so
being different is good but here's the
thing what do white people think when
they see that
do white people when they look at
Colin Kaepernick's hairstyles say to
themselves uh wow he's really
he's really done a good job of standing
out I like the fact that he's making
himself you know interesting and
different and it's a style question I
don't think so
I think that it makes him look less
credible
how many would you agree with that now
remember
I'm not saying the hair is good or bad
it's not it has nothing to do with my
opinion of is fashion I'm saying how do
people receive it the people he's trying
to the people he's trying to persuade
do they look at that you know do they do
the Republicans in North Dakota
they look at that hairstyle and say
there's a man I'm going to listen to
no it reminds you of Bozo the Clown
and it's hard to take him seriously
now I think Trump had a little bit of
the same problem
I think that Trump had problems being
taken seriously because of his hair and
it wasn't until he served an entire term
as a president that people stopped
talking about his hair
have you noticed that
when was the last time somebody mocked
Trump
for his haircut
think about that
think about the fact that Trump
made his haircut
go away
just by performing for four years
because when when Trump was somebody who
was you know talking about being
president but hadn't done anything in
that domain you can mock him for
everything ah look at that clown hair
he'll never be president but then when
he is president for four years and you
get a result that many would say many
would say in fact the majority of
Americans at this point did a better job
than Biden well suddenly you don't make
something make fun of his hair anymore
do you his hair isn't so funny now is it
now Colin Kaepernick has that same
problem until he's done something
substantial
um I don't think
I don't think he'd get away with that
here
I think it's a risk
so I think that's a bad judgment but
talk about bad judgment he's got this
special
in which he is compared NFL to slavery
and I guess there's a scene in it in
which he's you know contrasting visions
of slaves put on the on the Block and
chains with NFL players all black and
the special who are lined up to be
examined by the owners of the teams so
NFL it's like slavery
um
problem problem with the analogy if I
may
has anybody ever heard me mention that
analogies are not as persuasive as
people think they are have I ever said
that yes every single day
every day I tell you analogies do not
persuade
I also use them
you could use an analogy to make a point
and that's good but they don't persuade
because people just argue about the
difference well that's not the same
watch me do it this is why you don't use
analogies
this this guy Colin Kaepernick
in public spent a lot of money and time
to create a piece of art
and persuasion that compares the NFL to
slavery but there are some differences
that I think need to be pointed out
I'm no historian so I need to fact check
on this right are there any historians
here
a lot of people watching I'll bet some
of you are must be at least one
historian
can somebody fact check me on this
because my education on this domain is
not complete
but I don't remember seeing a lesson
about people begging to be slaves
were there people who tried all their
lives to become slaves who were not
slaves not born slaves but they worked
really hard and they trained and they
trained and they trained until they
could become slaves
was that in history because I don't
remember that because that does apply to
the NFL
the NFL is someplace where people train
for years and years and it's their
greatest dream to become an NFL player
and by the way can somebody also do a
fact check on this this I need another
fact check
are are white people allowed to play in
the NFL
because I'm a little confused by the
documentary
it would seem to suggest that white
people are are not allowed to play in
the NFL are they still allowed
can he be white to be in the NFL
because if you can be I'm a little
confused
because do they do the white NFL players
have a different process
and maybe only the black players are
lined up in front of the owners do they
do the white NFL players I know they're
not many of them but do the white
players uh they get picked down do they
go oh hold on hold on we only do the
slave thing with the black players is
that what's happening and then the white
players uh go to a go to a fine dining
place and just have dinner with the
owners
you know have some drinks
I need a fact check because because
Colin is indicating that only the black
people get in the NFL I mean he doesn't
say that but that's sort of the
implication do you see the problem with
the analogy
and I'm also I need another fact check
on this but how much
um what was the average pay of the
slaves can somebody give me a fact check
because again
I remember it as being kind of low
slaves were were not paid millions of
dollars a year right am I am I wrong
about that because again I'm confused
yeah right below minimum wage exactly
somebody is saying the slaves were
actually played paid below minimum wage
and that's not good
I mean some people are saying it was
Zero
zero
oh yeah that's what a slave is
oh yeah oh yeah slaves get paid zero
what does the NFL get paid it must be
zero because he wouldn't have used this
analogy do NFL players get paid zero
can somebody fact check that for me
so anyway
uh
I feel as though
the black population of this country is
absolutely getting screwed by their own
leaders being incompetent really because
imagine imagine what a capable black
leader could get done
let me just think about it
just think about a capable black leader
who just said you know I don't like the
Republican thing
but I'm going to work with them I'm
going to find some things we have in
common I'm going to make that happen and
see if we can get some momentum going
right and that would be effective
that would be effective that's what a
good black leader would look like yeah
Larry Elder somebody like that could
pull that off
um but I think as long as you have uh
CNN a bunch of white people deciding who
they're going to and I'm just use CNN as
a stand-in for the left as long as you
have the media picking your leaders and
deciding who gets attention and who gets
a documentary and who gets a big article
about them who gets to be on the cover
of the magazine as long as it's a bunch
of white people making those decisions
is white people picking black leaders
because attention is what makes you a
leader as much as anything
so
I would call that uh I would call that
systemic racism where you're where your
white media gets to pick your black
leaders and they don't do a good job of
it it wouldn't wouldn't that fall under
the category of
white supremacy
you know supported by CNN
I think so
I know I don't even think that's too far
is it if if you knew if you were some
ethnicity and you knew that different
ethnicities decided who your leader was
going to be
would you consider that okay I don't
think so
all right um
did you see the G20 photo I don't know
if this is photoshopped is this real
this looks unreal
so I want to say I'm not sure I believe
it yet but you remember the story of uh
Trump was it the G8 or the G20 the
famous thing where he shoved himself you
know sort of humorously shoved himself
to the front of the line or the the
middle central part
and that became a famous thing it's like
oh God our our president's a bully he's
shoving around these people and putting
himself in front
and then we see the Biden picture if
it's real it might be photoshopped
because I can't even believe it and and
the group is together and then he's like
standing off the side like he wasn't
really invited you know like he was
sneaking into the picture or something
was that
was that even a real picture
can somebody give me a fact check on
that I I guess I should have Googled it
more but somebody says it's real
now remember I told you let's let's say
it's real because it's more fun
um
this is yet another thing
where I think you appreciate Trump
because when Trump literally bullied his
way to the front of the line that did
make people mock him true
it did you know
make you think of Ugly Americans
true
but
what's the other thing you did the other
thing it did is made everybody think
sheesh you got a strong president there
maybe too strong and you'd bullying
yourself to the front he's putting
himself in front of everything if you
don't think that that bullying his way
to the front actually gave him more
power you don't understand power
let me say it again if you don't
understand that literally bullying
himself to the center of the picture
gave him more power
if you don't understand that then
there's a lot you don't understand
I was going to do maybe a micro lesson
on the locals platform it's a
subscription platform where I put my uh
my lessons two to four minute lessons on
how to be more effective basically
um I was going to do a lesson on some
people understand energy
and some people just look at cause and
effect
and that sometimes misses the energy
thing Trump is an energy monster
there are other people who are energy
monsters too and energy monsters
see energy almost like they almost feel
it
and they move toward it and they control
it and they they focus it but their
their energy Movers
and then there are other people just
looking at the surface facts
the people who are looking at the
surface effects will never understand
the energy Movers
the energy monsters
are invisible in terms of their
technique
to people who are not tuned into energy
as as the major way to understand the
world
right when I said there's something big
Brewing that's coming in the world it's
an energy observation
that the world has all this pent-up
energy largely from the pandemic
and it needs to go somewhere the energy
just doesn't disappear it just
transforms it moves but it doesn't
disappear there's just a ton a ton and I
think you feel it too of pent up energy
it's going to go somewhere and I don't
know if it'll necessarily go somewhere
good it could might be something
excellent coming but there's too much
energy
that's my observation so if you say what
does that exactly mean I don't know I
just know the energy is going to go
somewhere and that usually means a war
or a something big I hope it's not a war
anyway
um
there was a youngkin had a rally today's
election day for the Virginia governor
race
and there are at least three different
uh tweets that involved different photos
of the same guy who attended it who had
a Confederate flag patch on his jacket
like a really big one on the back of his
jacket so that you could take a picture
of him standing there you could get his
jacket but you could also get youngkin
in the background so you could associate
him with a Confederate flag and
everybody took the head and took that
picture
now that is your media lying to you
now I don't know
if that gentleman with the Confederate
flag patch was a real youngkin supporter
but
it is the most obvious kind of political
hoax
it's the most obvious kind where the
other team sends the wrong person to
your rally so that it looks like you
know the wrong people attend the rally
it's exactly what the uh the Lincoln
project did they send actors to look
like white supremacists at a youngkin
thing it's the single most common
political trick to send send a fake
person to a rally
so it worked as tricks go it's a pretty
good one because it works the the photos
were there they got published probably
makes a difference
so
uh that was a good trick I guess
um are you wondering what my opinion is
on who should win the uh the governor
race
do you think I have an opinion what do
you think my opinion is
um you've seen me talk about it a number
of times
who do you think I want to win the
governorship
um you probably think I'm going to say
McAuliffe right because he's I'm sorry
you probably think I'm going to say
junkan because he's a Republican and you
imagine that I support him
um
all right here's my answer
I don't have an opinion
here's why
now I I would like
I love the news to be to deal with the
fact that it looks like some momentum
for Trump
to me that that would be sort of an
excellent outcome if the media thought
oh this is a referendum and it looks
like Republicans are doing better I
would like that to happen
but in terms of which a person would be
a better Governor here's why I'm not
giving you my opinion because a huge
part of the decision is about abortion
would you agree I mean the school
system's a big you know maybe the
biggest part but a huge part of it is
the abortion question
and no I'm not a Democrat
um I'm I'm not I'm neither a Democrat
nor a Republican
and uh yeah I know you think that it's
weak to not have an opinion on abortion
and I will I will accept your
characterization because that's
subjective right your subjective opinion
to me is always valid because it's
subjective but objectively
you think it's weak to not have an
opinion uh on on abortion
well first of all I do have an opinion
I have an opinion that it is an
undecidable issue
meaning that the public will never agree
and if the public will never agree then
you default to the system
because that's how everything works
when when an opinion in the country is
close to 50 50
we let the government take care of it
because we can't decide and we need the
system to give us a decision so that we
can live together
because if we couldn't ever ever somehow
delegate the hard decisions to some
entity that we have a little bit of
trust in then we could just never get
past anything we'd just be at war with
each other all the time so it is
important that when you have a really
big issue like abortion and you can't
agree and you're not going to agree it's
important that you can offload the
decision offload it onto the government
so we can have some credibility and
somehow live with each other when we
decide
uh in my opinion the most credible
deciders are women
they have more skin in the game of
course men have skin in the game of
course it has to do with the money
aspect
then men should absolutely be involved
absolutely
um and I have lots of opinions on that
if if you want to hear them someday but
on the terms of just whether it should
happen forget about the forget about the
who has the rights to the kid forget
about the question of who pays for what
those are good questions and separate
but just the question whether it should
be legal at all
has to be women collectively deciding
separate from the decision of getting
one or not but the decision of whether
the law should be this way or that way
the most credible situation is that
women have most of the influence on that
and by no means would I want to take the
influence away from men who want to
participate if you want to participate
and you feel strongly about it
absolutely
Sandra says that's cowardly Sandra you
um let me be as clear as possible I'm
not afraid of you I'm not afraid of any
 person on here I'm not afraid of
my reputation and I'm not afraid of what
you think about my opinion about
abortion you're a for
calling me a coward
all right and you should leave my you
should leave my content immediately
I don't want you here
just leave
all right now am I worried about my
income
well this just got demonetized
I I just guaranteed that I lost
um
I don't know I won't give you an
estimate but since the the YouTube part
is monetized
that was very expensive for me to call
you a
all right that cost me about 10 of my
audience who just said I can't watch
this anymore kids were watching I can't
recommend this got demonetized instantly
and you
all right so
I have very little tolerance for the
tiny minded people who think everybody's
making political decisions based on fear
you're all making your decisions
on fear
all of you you just fear different
things
some of you fear big government
some of you fear of the vaccination
you're all afraid
all the time all of your decisions are
based on you might not call a fear you
might call it risk management I prefer
to call it that I prefer to call it risk
management but if you act like bravery
is a quality
no you idiot bravery is not a
quality you want to encourage in me or
in anybody else about their
opinions
the the lowest level of intellectual
quality is to say that the other
person's afraid
it's the lowest level of intellectual
debate
all right
so you and let's move on
um
the rest is invisible
it says the uh the race they were asked
whether the race was a referendum on
Biden or more of a local issue 36
percent said it's a referendum on Biden
you know that's just an opinion of
course and then 30 are not sure but if
you have them together you got 66
percent
who are least open to the idea that this
means something bigger than Virginia
okay
um
and I think that means that the media
gets to control the narrative if 66 are
open to the idea
or at least at least not close to the
idea that the media or that this is a
referendum then the media will get to
tell them it is
and they'll say it was and that will
actually have an influence on the
election now I assume that if
McAuliffe wins they'll say yeah that's a
referendum the left will say it is and
basically the media will will play with
us
anyway
um I don't think there is such a thing
as a referendum
I think
that we can be led to believe
something's a referendum and then then
it does have some persuasive effect so
the media will turn this into uh some
kind of a club the left will be
different than the right
um there's something happened with the Q
Anon group
that
I have a little suspicion about oh more
than the normal suspicion about Q Anon
and it goes like this
apparently Q Anon is now promoting the
idea that John Kennedy Jr Who We Believe
died
it was reported in the news that he died
in a plane crash
uh years ago because unlike my wife he
was not a good pilot
um by the way
Christina's probably going to get
certified for her IFR
I don't know if you call it license or
certifications or whatever is so she'll
actually be able to fly the plane that
John Kennedy died in
without dying
so it wouldn't matter if the clouds came
if she were flying because she knows how
to fly a plane by instruments alone
that's what that's what that means
flying by instruments instead of just
looking out the window
so if John Kennedy could have done that
he'd be alive today maybe unless it was
mechanical failure don't know anyway
um Q Anon is pushing the idea that the
allegedly dead John Kennedy Jr is really
alive and attending Q Anon events and
there's there's somebody who like
doesn't look at all like him but people
are saying there's him uh and that he
will be named as Trump's vice president
now
what does this tell you about Q Anon
if the first thing you say to yourself
is oh it's just more BS from q and on
it's just like everything else they've
said
I'm not so sure
you know what this looks like
it looks like somebody's trying to end q
and Q Anon because it looks like
somebody's taking the prank
to its obvious endpoint
doesn't it
you know as crazy as all the Q what Q
stuff was up till now and you know
largely debunked I think uh as crazy as
it's been has anything ever been this
crazy
because this one this one's a little I
don't know
this one's a little a little like
whoever is running Q is trying to see
how far they can take it
maybe to destroy it
in other words
is the person behind Q Pro or anti-trump
what do you think
is the current person behind queue
because we don't know if it's the same
people or person but is the current
person behind Q
pro-trump or anti-trump go
I see anti-trump
uh Q Anon does not exist anti
keeps people interested yes
anti yeah
but what if they're pro-chop
what if they're pro-trump what would be
the most productive thing they could do
if Q was now being run by somebody
pro-trump what is the most clever
productive thing they could do
destroy themselves
and out themselves as a prank
if Q is actually pro-trump the smartest
thing they can do is is take their
message to such an extreme that even the
most Ardent supporters say oh scrooby I
get it now it was always a joke
you have to take it so far
that even the the most dedicated
Believers say okay you got me
and maybe that's happening now that that
falls into the category of too clever
doesn't it like that that's assuming
people's a little too clever we don't
see that level of cleverness usually but
if there's an Intel
uh component
they are that clever
right so here's what you should look for
it's crazy enough that people have been
convinced actually that's true that the
the dead John Kennedy is really alive
John Kennedy Jr and that he'll be
Trump's vice president
now if you believe that what's coming
next
so here's how you could test the theory
and I'm not going to say it's that I
believe my own Theory yet but here's
what I would look for
what I look for is if the one after this
is even crazier like one that you know
can't be true right one where you could
check the DNA or something
so I don't know I keep an eye on that
there's a fake Trump statement about
Alec Baldwin so Trump did not say this
but it's being reported on social media
so somebody wrote a fake version of a
trump statement about Alec Baldwin and
here's how you know it's fake even
before it was debunked so it's already
been debunked we we know it's fake but
here's how you could have told
um at the very first part he referred to
himself as quote a great president
would Trump ever write
that he himself in the state in a
written statement not out loud but would
he ever write
that he was a great president yes or no
so I hear a yes
I see some nose
okay I see somebody who's who's up their
game a little bit and says greatest
would he ever say he's a great president
or would he say he's the greatest
president
well you're both wrong
here's what he would say
your favorite President
Trump would say your favorite President
that's how you know it's him
he would never say a great president
that's just not his words now why why do
I say that
here here's the most mind-effing thing
you're going to hear in your whole life
you ready
Trump got criticized for not being the
actual author of The Art of the deal
correct so he had a ghost writer which
is common for pretty much everybody at
that level
very uncommon for somebody at that level
to write their own book
um and wasn't the implied assumption
there that he needed a ghost writer
because he wouldn't be able to write it
himself
don't you sort of assume that that he
needed a ghost writer because he
wouldn't have the the skill to write it
himself
you kind of think that right
well I'm here to tell you
the Trump is a better writer than that
ghost writer
by far not even close The Ghost Writer
probably very good I would imagine you
know I I would imagine very good at his
game
but he's not this good
Trump's writing ability
is crazy good
right I do this for a living right I
like I write for a living and I would
say he's better than me
I hate to say it he does write better
than I do because he writes in a way you
can't look away
I mean you're just you're just glued to
it
when when Trump says your favorite
President that is so deliciously
perfectly complex
that you you can't stop thinking about
it but if you just said I'm a great
president there's nothing there
great great is just like an empty common
useful word but when he says your
favorite
your your brain just catches on fire
like I'm not sure he's my favorite I got
to think about this well okay he's in
the top ten you know so it one of them
is just
engineered perfection
your favorite President that's kind of
perfect
and and this uh this fake writing was
obviously a not a good writer I mean it
Trump's writing just jumps off the page
and slaps you in the face and uh so that
that's my mind f for today that Trump is
and this is an opinion from a
professional humor writer right in in
this one area I do have some credibility
I can pick out good writing I mean
that's my field right
and Trump is great
he is a great writer he's unconventional
but he is a great great writer uh he'll
never get credit for that by the way
all right um
I guess uh New York City there were
threats of 10 000 police officers
quitting the real number it looks like
it's going to be 34. I'm going to end on
this because I got to run but I will
give you this general statement whenever
people are are saying I'm going to quit
and you think it's going to be a problem
it hardly ever is
hardly ever you should usually bet
against it when anybody says I'm going
to quit and if I do even if they quit
I'm not saying they won't quit the
quitting part might be real but the fact
where where something bad happens
usually not real if your best employee
leaves what happens
not much
if the founder leaves what happens often
not much the difference would be a Steve
Jobs you know a Bill Gates that sort of
thing that makes a difference
but usually people can threaten to quit
and quit and you're actually going to be
fine
just in general you should bet against
it being a problem that is all I have to
do say today I gotta run and I will
