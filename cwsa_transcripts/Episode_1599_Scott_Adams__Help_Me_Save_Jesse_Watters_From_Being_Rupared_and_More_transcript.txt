[Applause]
good morning everybody
and welcome
to coffee with scott adams the best
thing that's ever happened in the
history of the multiverse
well let's start it off with a little
simultaneous sip
yeah something new
and uh all you have to do is grab some
kind of a container
what kind it doesn't really matter it
could be a copper mug or a glass of
tankers chalice or stein that a canteen
jugger flask of vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine head of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including the pandemic
it's called the simultaneous sip it's
happening
now
oh god i needed that
you know coffee
sometimes you want it
sometimes you need it
well
we got lots going on today my favorite
is uh the jesse waters trending story
i think you all know jesse waters from
fox news
well he's getting rupauled badly today
in social media by rupard i mean
take it out of context
so here's what he said roughly speaking
at a speaking event i think yesterday
he said that when if you run into dr
fauci
you should give him a rhetorical kill
shot
meaning you challenge him by saying
hey didn't you approve funding for that
wuhan lab
and then you say well why should we
trust you for anything else i'm
paraphrasing but the idea was that would
be a sort of a linguistic kill shot
and that if any video of that could be
presented you know fox news would
probably run it a lot
so that's what jesse waters said
that if you say the right words to mr
fauci and you get it on video
it could be like it could end his
importance i guess
well cnn decided to lop off the part
about it being words
this is actually happening it sounds
like i'm making this up but cnn is
running this you know they're they're
running this major uh campaign against
jesse waters now with clips
and they just remove the part where he's
talking about words
they just leave him the kill shot part
so fauci i don't think he heard the
original context
is on video responding to the kill shot
part
as if somebody had just told all fox
news listeners to go murder
dr fauci
now they're actually reporting this with
a straight face
just like you won't know the difference
the the boldness of this is hilarious at
this point
you know they they got away with so much
so far that i think that they really
think they can just do anything
and and all evidence suggests that they
can
that they can literally just run any
news
anything
and get away with it because their
audience doesn't check other sources
so as long as they're uh they have a
locked in audience you know they have
that locked in syndrome
watching cnn is sort of like
being in a coma
but they gave you a television
you can't change the channel because
you're in a coma but it's just playing
etch all the time
anyway so i would like to engage all of
you
to save jesse waters
from the
public
uh attacks
and all you need to do is show the real
real uh context and show that he was
talking about words
and embarrass cnn for their fake news
their fakest of fake news
by the way i'm i'm continuously amused
by cnn and fox news taking shots at each
other especially when it gets personal
when they're actually calling out
individual people
hosts and and producers and stuff
once it gets like that
that personal i can't turn away
i know i shouldn't be interested in it
and i know that it's the lowest quality
of
you know entertainment really doesn't
make it less entertaining
i don't know i like it
so i'm not sure it's good for the world
but i do enjoy it
i told you yesterday
that the
the very famous no agenda podcast most
of you have heard of it and most of you
have probably listened to it
in my opinion misrepresented several of
my opinions and then mocked me
for the misrepresented opinions
so i wondered what was going on there
and i actually
contacted uh one of the two hosts uh
john devorak i know him the best
and uh
basically said uh
what the going on
like what the
like i i actually was confused
i didn't know what was happening i
couldn't explain it in any way
because
what you need to know is that these
hosts are really rational people who
tend to stick to the facts and so this
was just way off their
standard play so i i didn't know what
was going on so i asked him directly and
uh john said that
um
you know they don't
he wasn't doing research for the segment
so he was just sort of surprised by the
topic as they normally are apparently
they you know the it's more of a
the podcast is off the top of their
heads about whatever the topic is
so you shouldn't expect deep research on
there that's not what they offer
um but he said he was just sort of
responding to what his co-host said um
adam curry
and uh
so he didn't really know what my views
were so he invited me to
uh say what my actual views are and he
would read them out on the podcast
that's about as good as you can do
right so you know have i told you before
that i judge people not by their
mistakes
by but by how they respond to them once
the mistake is obvious
now there's there's no there's no
effective way to correct something like
this
so it's it's just out there right and it
can never be corrected
but
the one thing you can do
is read into the record the accurate
thing when it's presented to you
now i i don't know if i'll ever get busy
enough to actually do that for him to
write up my opinions because that feels
like homework i don't like getting
homework assignments
just generally speaking if somebody
gives me an assignment i just don't want
to do it
just because somebody told me to do it
so i don't know if i'll do this but i
will give him credit for uh
being perfectly willing to
you know clean that up as much as
possible
all right um
saw a tweet from cherylin ifill
who is the president and director
council
of ldf which is an naacp legal defense
and educational fund
and
she complains
that our system seems to be broken
because
mansion
is having so much of an impact as one
person and she says in her tweet but
what kind of healthy democracy is
structured in a way
that can allow one man elected by 290
000 votes in one of the least populous
states to thwart the agenda of his party
and the president who is elected with 81
million votes
we need structural change
anybody
see any problems with that
analysis
i think this is somebody who missed a
few history classes
that's the best thing i can say about
this
because
it wasn't one person
it was
51 persons
it was all republicans
all of them
and if i don't have to remind you
republicans came very very close
to winning the presidency the second
time
yeah
so uh and then of course the more
obvious thing that we are republic
uh hello we're a republic
it is designed
so that you can't get everything you
want easily
meaning the
the party in power can't just ram stuff
through it's designed that way
it's supposed to stop you
from an overreach
this was the most
classic case of a system working that
i've ever seen
am i wrong
joe mentioned stopping with you know the
other senators of course
stopping this the build back better
thing no matter what you think your
opinion of the the actual bill is
but the system was supposed to stop this
it was designed exactly
to stop this
you know not this specific bill but
stuff exactly like this
that's that's the system
it is meant to do this and it did it and
it did it well
now it was close
i mean if i have a complaint about the
system is that it didn't stop it more
thoroughly
you know it got too close
but it worked
you know
if you're going to go binary about it it
almost didn't work
you could argue it almost didn't work
but it did work
in the end it worked right
yeah joe manchin runs the country in
effect
um
but he couldn't do it unless there were
50 republicans who leaned that way as
well
all right
we learned from lance gooden who's a
texas congress person
that the amount of fentanyl struggle the
smuggled struggle
smuggled across the border has increased
by 300 percent
uh i don't know what period maybe maybe
in the last year or so
um and he points out that fentanyl is
the only thing not affected by joe
biden's supply chain crisis
why is it that we could get more
fentanyl but less of everything else
they're doing something right we should
get those uh cartel people to work on a
supply chain crisis
but um here's my take on this
uh we need to withdraw all of our
diplomats from china until they address
this because as you know the precursors
come from china
they're shipped to the cartels the
cartels put it together and then send it
to the united states now the cartels are
doing it for money
but i don't think china is doing it for
money it's just a war on the united
states to weaken us and is working to
the tune of 79 000
people a year
dead
and uh and far more than that
wounded in the sense that the families
that remain are just devastated forever
uh i can speak from personal experience
and
i think we have to withdraw our
diplomats from china just over this
you know we've got lots of reasons to
withdraw our diplomats the uyghur
situation that would be plenty do you
need more than that
really
one word uyghurs why do we have
diplomats in china
there's no explaining that
but when you throw in the the fact that
they're actively attacking us in a
i would say in the kinetic way
would you say that the fentanyl attack
is a kinetic attack
does that does that fit the definition
of a kinetic attack
it's yes right
it's a kinetic attack because there's a
physical item the fentanyl
that is physically
sent out in a way that they assume will
enter
american bodies and kill them
that's a kinetic attack
we're in a kinetic war with china and we
just leave our embassy over there oh
let's talk
about lunch
 you
 you government of the united states
withdraw our our diplomats now
before the olympics
make it stick
make it hurt
withdraw them before the olympics we can
still talk to china of course we'd have
a million ways to communicate so it
wouldn't be a problem but as a show
you can't treat them like a normal
country anymore
i'm sorry they're not like the rest of
the countries they're not they're
 attacking us with kinetic
weapons
stop it
and while we're at it we need to drone
the cartels
like all of them
just wipe them out
because don't tell me we don't know
where they are
and if that requires taking out some of
the elected representatives of the
mexican government we need to do that
too
if we need to invade mexico
to fix it
we need to do that it's time it's just
time to do that
michael cohen
got sent back to jail for talking about
his book
what
so he was released because of the coved
danger so he was on i guess
house arrest or something
and he was talking about his book and
working on his book and uh apparently
he had some kind of provision for house
arrest
that he would not speak to the media or
pursue a previously announced book
project during the term of his sentence
how is that legal
i get the part where if you break the
law
there are penalties for the law
right the penalties are
described in the law
which part of the penalty for whatever
crime he was accused of
says you don't have freedom of
speech
seriously freedom of speech
we're taking that away from him
are you kidding me
well no i don't like michael cohen
but can we be real for a second this was
clearly political
clearly political
and he can't talk
are you kidding me he needs to be
released immediately
immediately the fact that this even
happened to him at all
he needs to be completely released now
that this is a government
political prosecution i mean
this part of it
and what about all those uh those people
still being held for january 6th
what the kind of a country have we
become
when we have political prisoners it's
obvious it's
it's not even one situation now we have
two situations where there are clearly
political prisoners in the
united states
in the united states we have
political prisoners
now i was willing to like wait and see
how that played out
but this this this basically tells you
the cohen situation
basically tells you that nobody's even
hiding it
completely out in the open
yeah roger stone you could make the same
argument
exactly
this is completely unacceptable
completely unacceptable
uh cohen should be free completely now
the the
uh i i think that if a government does
this to you you just have to be set free
period
how is this not in the supreme
court
this should be in the supreme court
tomorrow
really we took freedom of speech away
from a american
right in front of you and you're like oh
okay worry about what's happening
tomorrow what's for lunch
good lord
um
raspin paul says only 31 say biden
represents their views
whereas a far
higher percentage say trump represents
service among republicans
not so surprising about trump
as i've often said the most persuasive
person
who ever lived
and
but the biden one certainly suggests you
couldn't possibly win re-election
unless a lot changes
you want some good news
i know you do
omicron is here
omicron is now the dominant strain in
america
i don't know how they know that exactly
i'm not sure they could tell that but
but as of today
75
cases are omicron
omicron
is here
it is
the final battle
do you know why it's the final battle
because no matter how it goes
we're done
we're done
and i will suggest
that the public needs to now take
control
not not as a revolution
not as an insurrection
not as a replacement for your government
as an assistant
our government
which
you know we like to think sometimes is
there to help us sometimes not so much
but at the moment it needs our help
and if we see this as us against them
we won't be nearly as effective
because it's not
it's not us against them our government
is stuck in a system which they can't
get out of
because the system has them trapped and
the system is if you let too many people
die you can't get elected
that's their game keep people from dying
can't get elected if too many people die
we don't have that constraint we the
public can make our own decisions about
risk management so our government is not
the right tool for getting us out of the
pandemic and releasing the mandates
that's the public
but the public must need be focused
i heard many people bravely say
six months ago i
dropped all my
you know cooperation with masking or
whatever
that doesn't help
one of you doing something by yourself
that doesn't help
that's not gonna add anything it
probably won't even help you
you'll just get in trouble it only works
if we all do it
or enough of us do it i don't know what
the critical number is probably 20
percent if 20 of the public does
anything it's
something's going to happen big
and so
we we lack any kind of a leader to
negotiate with
our government
i know both greg goffeld and i have
suggested that in greg's word we need
some kind of a
hostage negotiator
to get us out of the mandates
i think that greg and i just became your
negotiators
which i sure as hell don't want
it's like literally the last thing i'd
want but on the other hand
if you live in the country and you have
a patriotic
um bent at all
you can't walk away if there's nobody
else who's gonna do it
now i'd rather someone else do it i
don't think i'm the best choice
but here we are
and so i'd like to begin with this
because we really only need one thing
a date
do you agree
the only thing we need is a date we all
agree
that's all we need
nothing else you don't need to march
you don't need to march
you don't need to protest you don't need
to uh protest the capital
you don't need to run an insurrection
you don't need to hate your government
you don't need to curse of them you
don't need to even be unkind you don't
need to be unkind to your fellow
citizens
about anything
just need a date
that's it
february 1st
that's the date
february 1st and i know all the clever
people say oh it was last year february
first but let's be serious for a moment
february 1st
simply make it a thing
just tell your government that that's
your final day
for mandates and just take your masks
off now lots could change between now
and february 1st do you all agree
do you all agree that something could
change
where we could maybe as a public say
whoa okay that's no longer a good idea
but given what we know now
and the direction of things
february 1st seems very reasonable
because it gets us past
the holiday bump that we know we're
going to have
if things are heading down in february
first and they should be
they should be in terms of death not
infections
infections might be up while deaths are
down but if deaths are still going down
on february 1st
i think i think we're done
i think we're done
so
uh let's see in the comments can i get
an agreement on february 1st
as a message to our government that they
should respond to
agree okay i'm seeing lots of yeses on
locals
um yeah and the the we are already done
thing doesn't help anybody
it's the doing at the same time that
could help
but doing your own thing doesn't help
anybody
yeah i was done a year ago doesn't help
anybody
you know it's nice but it doesn't help
anyway
all right
february 1st it is
um
and the the indications are that the
omicron uh
here here are the actual symptoms from
omicron
uh
fever or chills cough runny nose
headache or muscle aches
gastrointestinal issues and loss of
taste or smell
in other words
how i feel every day
literally the symptoms of omicron
are literally what i feel every day
because i have allergies right
so i hardly go a day without one of
these things i got i have muscle aches
from exercising
gastrointestinal issues from
drinking too much coffee i lost my taste
and smell years ago
and uh
you know
and the news gives me a headache
so i i feel like you know once it gets
to the point where you can't tell the
difference between the pandemic and
normal life
that should be the cutoff point
let's see
my symptoms from the pandemic
seem to match perfectly my symptoms of
just getting up and being alive
anyway i'm exaggerating a little bit but
um
omicron's the final battle
and we have all the tools now
our
our immune systems are
boosted
one way or another a lot of us took
vitamin d got outside a lot of us
exercised i worry about the extra
obesity but we'll see
all right big question is ivermectin
debunked totally or still in the
category of well it might work so give
it a try because there's not much
downside
i found the best
source i've seen to discuss that so i
tweeted it
and i'll probably retweet this every
time the conversation comes up
now i do want comment on it
because
uh
you know even the debunk can be wrong
right
but the debunk goes through the
following points
that the peru experience some people say
hey peru
solved this problem with ivermectin that
never happened
that never happened they cherry-picked
data but if you look at the actual peru
data now there's nothing like that
um
likewise with india there's nothing
there's nothing like that
if you look at the real data
and
if you look at the trials it is true
that there's a whole bunch of trials
that indicate ivermectin works
however
the ones that are
the most reliable
say don't
or doesn't
so the most credible trials say it
doesn't the least credible trials
universally almost say it does
and
apparently if you do a meta-analysis the
problem is
that the biggest trials
actually the problem was the one of the
meta-analysis did not correct for
number of people in the trials
which sounds like a pretty big error
anyway the meta-analysis were just uh
let me explain why a meta-analysis
doesn't work
i'm sure there are cases where it does
but here's why it doesn't work in this
case and probably a lot of other cases
when you're doing the meta-analysis if
you just look at all of the studies
and you don't try to pick out which are
the good ones or the bad ones
you could end up with a situation where
the largest studies if you did it right
and adjusted by number of participants
the largest studies if any one of them
are wrong
it's it's too big of a
a factor in the hole so it moves the
whole
so in other words just one big wrong
trial
could bias your entire meta-analysis one
way or another so you think you're
looking at a meta-analysis
but you're not you're looking at one
trial and it was defective
so lots of times you can think you've
proven something with a meta-analysis
but you haven't proven anything
nothing literally nothing
you you just threw in bad data and got a
bad result
now
uh take a look at that uh i'm not the
one who's the expert so i'm not going to
claim that this debunk is 100
i'm going to claim it's just the best
presentation of the argument okay
if you were to say to me but you know
there's still so much
signal there that i think i'd take it
anyway
maybe
maybe yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't say
that was unwise
to take it anyway if your doctor agreed
but i would say according to this
if you do the analysis correctly
in the opinion of the people who did
this debunk if you do the analysis uh
correctly even the meta-analysis signal
disappears
hey dick
richard smith has a comment scott always
with the cop out on predictions
well dick
and i am talking to you dick
it's not a cop-out to put percentages on
predictions
that would be called
rational thinking
rational thinking
deck
so
is it just a coincidence that so many of
my critics are named dick that like that
that's their actual name
why
why is that so often true
all right here's a question for you what
would it tell you if you compared states
in the united states we've got enough
data now enough run time
that we should be able to tell something
would you agree
do you agree that at this point
you should be able to tell something by
how the different states treated things
and if they got a good or bad result yes
or no
you can or cannot tell things from the
states yet
oh i love the people saying no
i love you with a passion
um
the answer should be no until it turns
yes
that's what i'm thinking
there should be some point
at which some clarity starts to emerge
but there's no way it happened early so
first year no it doesn't tell you
anything
second year i don't know
it might start to
so let me make a case
for
the vorb
vorb
vorb
it's an acronym i just made up and it
stands for vaccination rate obesity
republicans and
black black meaning black
citizens
of the united states
and my argument is this that the higher
your vorb
score is
uh the worse you're doing
the worse you're doing
so i'm gonna and the way you would
calculate the vorb
is to multiply all these rates so the
vaccination rate just treat it like it's
a a number not a percentage so if it's
like 75 percent in a state you just say
75 times
the obesity rate again change the
percentage to just the wrong number
and the percentage of republicans in
state and percentage of black population
and my argument is
that if you've got a high score on
two or three of these you're in bad
shape
right so let's look at some states
representative states and see if the
vorb score is predictive
let's look at
the worst state and the best state in
terms of covet outcome do you think that
will tell us something well not by
itself but let's do it for fun
mississippi is doing the worst
coincidentally they have the highest
percentage of black population
presumably a high i didn't check the
republican
percentages but
you know i think we all know which of
the red states
so they've got high black population
high republican population high obesity
and the lowest vax rate
so that should predict that they have
the worst
outcome right
and they do
they have the worst outcome
basically all four things are
uh negative for them
all right let's check some others how
about the the state that is the best
now don't
don't call me racist for saying it's
best in this context
i know what you're gonna do don't jesse
waters me
don't jesse waters me
uh or roop army i guess would be the
right way to say that
um
vermont
has only one percent black population
and they have a i think the highest rate
of vaccination 77 percent
so vermont has low obesity low black
population low republican population and
the highest vaccination rate
and they have the best result
just like you'd expect
let's take something in the middle
let's compare a california to a texas
okay
because
texas has a higher substantially higher
uh death rate
but
um
not too far out of the range 258 per
hundred thousand in in texas california
is 191.
now percentage-wise that's a pretty big
difference
but they're still in that middle range
uh
12 black in texas six percent black in
california
but california has more vaccinations
compared to taxes
fewer republicans
and
the obesity rate in california i think
is much less than texas
so if you put those together so so uh
california would be how many is it good
on
good
being relative to this conversation only
but california has a relatively low
uh republican and black population
compared to texas
and a high vaccination rate
and low obesity so you would expect
california to do better than texas and
substantially
and it is
and it is
so the vorb works there as well
let's take um south dakota
because you say to yourself well south
dakota is going to be an outlier right
because there it's so uh
is so unpopulated you think the density
is pretty low
south dakota is really high in deaths
despite having
only two percent black population
yeah but
they got some republicans
they've got the lowest very low of x-ray
the lower one not lowest but low
vaccination rate
high obesity
so the vorb would say well
three and a four
that should give you a high death rate
and they do
and they do they have a high death rate
relative to the other places
so here's my
so other things you need to throw in
there is age
how they mitigated against
in the early part because remember these
are cumulative numbers so florida did
better with the senior care than new
york did which may explain why new york
is near the top
so new york has a high vaccination rate
and low republicans
but i would say
that probably there was a special case
there with the
senior care
so that might be an outlier
anyway
i don't think that you can see
um
i don't think that you'd see too much
other than these things i don't see
masking necessarily as jumping out
as a as a thing so i would just propose
this to you that if three out of four of
these things are bad in your state
you're gonna have a bad
outcome so vax rate obesity
percentage of republicans percentage of
black now you could also you could
you could uh
you could also say that the percentage
of republicans and percentage of black
population is really just a proxy for
vaccination rates right
kind of it's a proxy for vaccination
rates
they kind of run together
so i think it's going to be
obesity and vaccination rate is going to
explain everything
except an outlier like new york that may
have handled the senior care worse
that's what it looks like
now how many of you think that
vaccinations are have no correlation to
death rates in states
how many of you think that's true that
we don't have any data that shows
vaccinations are lowering the death rate
not the infection rate that's a
different
question
but the death rate
well um we do have plenty of evidence
that vaccinations lower the death rate
substantially
so the
and the people who can read
data well such as andres backhouse
you can see that my twitter feed if you
want to follow up in the detail but
there is there is very strong data that
the vaccinations reduce deaths i don't
know if it will matter to omicron
omicron might blow right through it
but
probably won't get you a sick at least
it looks like it now
all right
uh how many of you are bothered by my
discussion
of either ivermectin or
state comparisons
is anybody bothered by it
oh okay
no complaints
you just want to say vorb
i tell you the the vorb
predictor it looks pretty strong
now of course i'm only doing it by
eyeballing stuff so i mean you'd have to
do a lot more work to know if it's a
real a real correlation or not
might be fake
all right um
that
is just about what i want to say i'll
tell you what doesn't seem to be a
factor
is a density
density doesn't seem to be as much of a
factor
did did you see that coming now you
could argue that maybe new york city is
a case of density but they also have
international travel and they handle the
seniors different and
blotted
bladder yeah all right
well that's what we think we know uh
february 1st
is the day that we're giving our
government
how many of you would agree to allow
greg gutfeld and i
to be your negotiators
for your freedom
is anybody on board with that
and by the way let me say again if
somebody else wants to do this
please do
i mean i could get killed doing this i
mean literally i could get murdered
for you know
for raising my hand in a situation like
this
but
i'll do it if nobody else is going to do
it
somebody just said in the comments on
youtube that i looked like a geek 20
years ago
but
now i don't look as much like a geek
i have to tell you that was intentional
20 years ago was in the the height of
dilbert's rise i was doing a lot of
speaking engagements and media
appearances
and part of the story was that dilbert
was
sort of me
and so i would actually uh i would under
dress
you know i i had the resources to dress
well i mean i could just hire somebody
to you know make sure that i dress well
uh but i chose not to so i actually
chose a
uh an understated nerdish look because
it was more compatible with dilbert and
just made the story better
so yes there was some and also i was
working insane hours
in those days so i didn't i couldn't
exercise you know so that makes
something of a difference
um
can i use a double body double well how
many of you think you know somebody who
looks like me
watch this
how many of you know somebody
who sort of looks like me
watch all the yeses
this is part of my theory that there are
only 100 people
yeah there are only 100 people and
everybody's one of those hundred
everybody knows somebody like me
how many of you know somebody who looks
like me watch this watch this how do you
how many of you know somebody who looks
like me
and his first name is steve
go
looks like me
yes yes i'm seeing yeses
a lot of people named steve
look like me
why
i don't know
i don't know
i can't explain it
but i'll tell you it's true
all my life
when people get my name wrong and they
come up to me they say hey steve and
i'll say oh no it's
it's scott
and it'll be somebody who doesn't know
me at all it wasn't somebody who got my
name wrong they actually thought i was
their friend steve
so all my life people have walked up to
me in like different parts of the
country
and said
steve
all my life i don't know why
i guess it's just a white guy name
that's probably
that's probably all it is
all right um
do guffeld's show and announce the
february 1st well we'll see if if uh
greg is on board with us and then
we'll we'll take it from there
uh
steve is a funny name for a cat
that is a funny name for a cat
i i am so on board with that comment
on youtube somebody said steve is a
funny name for a cat
that's a great day for a cat
a great name i'm gonna name my next cat
steve
she won't like it
but
all right that's all i have for today it
was short but i think you'd all agree
the best thing that's ever happened
and
uh if you'd like to see me angry some
more
uh just wait a few more days with
nothing happening on fentanyl
because you're going to see it
um

mourinho substance article response to
the ivermectin article you referenced by
scott alexander i haven't tweet that at
me i'd like to see it
and that's all i got for now and i will
talk to you
