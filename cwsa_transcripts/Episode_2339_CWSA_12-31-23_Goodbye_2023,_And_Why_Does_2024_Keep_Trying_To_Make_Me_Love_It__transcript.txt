good morning everybody and
welcome this is the best thing you've
ever seen in your life certainly the
best thing you've seen all year long
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
it's the best thing you're ever going to
enjoy period And if you'd like to take
it up to the next level to get ready for
20124 yeah that's right we're going to
fluff it up 2024 all you need is a cup
of glass of tanker chalice is Ty the K
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee enjoy me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopamine the the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called a simultaneous sip it happens now
go ah I I'm pretty sure that was the
best SIP of the
year yeah saved it for
last well may I say something I will
never say again are you ready for this I
will never say this again happy
123123 that's today's date if you look
at the date it's 1 two 3 one 2 3 yeah
I'll never say that again and if I do it
won't make any sense well I'm going to
add to my list of
accomplishments um turns that I'm quite
proud of this one and if you don't mind
I'd like to take a a moment to
brag sometimes you know you get into
public life and you say to yourself I
wonder if I can make something better
for somebody somewhere if I could just
make one person's life complete or just
better then my life would be complete as
well and it turns
out that according to the Wisconsin
State Journal I have played my role uh
they were looking at the list of names
popular names for babies and turns out
that there's one name that used to be
popular back in the
40s but for some
reason and see if you see if you can
guess what that reason is that name is
no longer
popular that name is Delbert D lb r t
and as the Wisconsin State Journal
points out people might think it sounds
a little bit too like
Dilbert and people don't want to name
their child after a hapless cartoon
character so I did that that's right
while you were doing practically nothing
I was ruining a perfectly good
name so there's
that you're
welcome here's some news I I didn't know
about um did you know that uh during
during the pandemic there was a shortage
of
diamonds is that the most up
story you've ever heard in your life
during the
pandemic oh yeah people died yeah
millions of people died millions of
people put a vaccination into their body
that they wish they hadn't but the real
problem was a shortage of diamonds yeah
so do you know what happened when there
was a shortage of diamonds well
human uh Ingenuity kicked in and
apparently lab grown diamonds have been
a thing for a while but they were not
accepted and maybe they learned to make
them better but now the lab grown
diamonds are certified as being
identical to Natural ones in other words
in a in a lab setting you basically
couldn't tell the difference
so uh Diamond companies have started
Feathering bring in you know more
artificial diamonds which are of course
far less cost they still have the normal
ones but they're you know big
substantial part of their business now
is fake diamonds and here's the fun part
they say that people getting married are
actually requesting lab grown diamonds
because they're
cheaper now if you got
married and you gave your fiance a lab
grown diamond is that a is that a good
omen isn't the whole point of a diamond
to show
off like don't don't women get their
diamond and like oo look at me look at
my diamond he loves me so much that he
he paid you know two months of wages for
my
diamond how many months are you supposed
to spend what what's the rule two months
two
months somebody says 6 months two or
three months of pay on your diamond
right well what happens when you're
showing your artificial lab grown
Diamond around look at buy artificial
lab grown Diamond the total expense to
make it was 75
cents uh but my fiance paid nearly
$1,000 he loves me I don't know I just
don't know if it'll work as well you
know what I'd love to see I'd love to
see an analysis and 20 years of the
divorce rate of people who got real
diamonds versus lab grown
diamonds I have a feeling it's going to
be a leading
indicator you know they used to say uh
that the the number one indicator of
divorce was the existence of contempt if
you saw either partner show contempt it
was a guarantee of divorce
practically I don't know about these lab
grown d
we'll see it could be a sign that two
people are well
adjusted and that's a good sign maybe
they have a much better rate well here's
something that doesn't surprise anybody
would you like to hear the least
surprising news of the day Hawaii has
one of the highest life expectancies in
the
country is anybody surprised by
that have you ever been to
Hawaii do you know what you won't find
uh in Maui
anyway
traffic traffic there's not much
traffic but imagine how your life would
be and your tension and everything else
if the only change the only change was
no traffic and you could just sort of go
anywhere you wanted
easily all right well here are the
reasons that are given of course people
are getting more sun because it's sunny
all the time apparently Hawaii has very
low obesity levels and low
smoking and people do a lot of walking
and they have good health
care so it turns out that if you have a
son low obesity low smoking you walk a
lot get outoors and you have good health
care that your life expectancy is
longer I'm just adding the part about
low stress and not much traffic
huh I have another the
that I'm going to add to it well a
hypothesis um I wouldn't put more than a
20% chance that this might be true but
you know what else happens in Hawaii
people walk
Barefoot yeah Hawaii is sort of a
Barefoot kind of a place you might have
you know the sliders on or something but
you're going to have them on and off
during the day so what if it turns out
that that grounding thing is real where
if if you have your bare feet in the
ground Outdoors that balances your
electrical signals or something what if
that's real I have no idea if that's
real science I'm very skeptical of it
but I'll tell you something I've been
experimenting
with I've been experimenting with the
grounding except I don't like taking my
shoes off Outdoors because it's you know
it's inconvenient to wash your feet but
it's easier to wash your hands so I've
been doing it with my hands
CU nobody can tell me there's any
electrical reason I can't do it with my
hands right so I just go outoors and if
there's like a you know a rock or
something I just lean on the rock for a
few minutes and here's the weird thing
it feels like it
works has anybody tried it you just grab
doors and just lean on a rock just put
your hands on a rock and just lean on it
for 15 20
seconds I swear to God god it feels like
it's working in real time has anybody
had that
experience I think it's
psychological I think it's not related
to anything real but I can't get over
the fact that I can feel it in real time
I can feel some kind of healthy feeling
come over me now let me say this as
clearly as I
can I'm skeptical that this is real
I think I might be talking myself into
it but what's the
difference if you could put your hand on
a rock and feel
better does it matter Why Try It Go
doors and put your hand on a big
rock just see what happens you might be
surprised can't hurt you all right uh Mr
Beast and Elon Musk Mr Beast is H the
biggest social media presence in the
world Hees does a lot of
uh fascinating video so he's a big deal
on social media if you didn't
know and he was being asked why he's not
putting his videos on the xplatform and
he had a little interchange with Elon
Musk on that and the basic answer is
that YouTube pays better and that if
x um monetized his
videos better that you would do it he
says it cost him millions of dollars to
make his videos which I believe is true
and he doesn't want to just give it away
and have people watch it on X and not
watch it on YouTube or he's monetized
but the fun part of this is that
apparently X is working on competing
with
YouTube so they're not there but and I
don't know the details and I can't
confirm it but the rumor is that X will
have a more of a YouTube like monetary
sharing
situation at which
Point um I think a lot more people are
going to put video
there all right um here's some news this
is shocking I don't know see if you're
surprised as I am by this but Facebook
suspended the libs of Tik Tok account
for violating his community
standards now I don't know if you're as
surprised as I am but did you know how
many of you knew that Facebook is still
a
product like when I read this I'm like
what Facebook is still a
product it's such a product that they
can cancel people
what some of you were surprised at the
cancellation I'm just surprised that
Facebook is still something that
somebody
uses so we don't know what they
were suspended for probably the usual
stuff but the uh person who runs that
account uh J raek she said
this by the way I freaking hate Facebook
I don't even know how to use it I don't
get it I don't like it never did never
had a personal account I pay someone to
run my Facebook I probably logged on
once it's a pretty shitty platform I
hope it dies it probably will it
probably will because the censorship
game isn't sustainable in the long run
and the younger people aren't using
it that is correct when was the last
time you used
Facebook like it's my generation is
supposed to be using it right I don't
use it I don't even know what's the
point yeah I go on about once every few
months um let me tell you
why and I'm going to quot somebody on
the xplatform Jay Jay
Dugan and Jay Dugan weighed in on this
question and said and I quote face
Facebook is a good way to stay in touch
with your misinformed friends and
family okay that's just too
good
yeah it is a way to stay stay connected
to your misinformed friends and
family that's the only thing it's good
for well you know the misinformed need
love
too uh we love the undereducated and the
misinformed all
right uh let me ask you this
question uh what is the vend diagram
Andor overlap between these two groups
of
people uh the people who say you vaccine
should be required and you should wear
your mask so that's one group of people
the very Pro vaccine uh covid vaccine
specifically and prask
how many of them are also the climate
alarmists all of
them it feels like it's most of them
doesn't it and then somebody added how
many of them are the trans
activists I feel like it's all the same
group and do you know what the group all
have in
common they believe
science they believe believe what they
were told by the the people on TV if the
people on TV said it was true and their
teachers said it was
true I don't know what's
stupider in almost
2024 believing your teacher or believing
science it really has been a mistake
lately hasn't it like an incredible
mistake there was a time and it wasn't
that long ago when I would have mer
mercilessly mocked people who disagreed
with the consensus of
science yeah I was one of those I was
one of those do you know what changed my
mind 20 years of seeing science being
wrong about everything I'll tell
you my biggest anti-science moment and
I've told this story before but putting
it in context helps uh many years ago
when Dilbert first started making me a
lot of money I thought to myself you
know what
I like to you know maybe give back to
the world that's been so nice to me so I
thought I'm going to do a business that
primarily is to help the world you know
but if I made money that'd be good so I
I started a uh a food company that would
try to make the most
nutricious um food item a burrito that
would that would be packed with all the
right food to have um a good balance of
all the nutrients and minerals you need
so if you eat normally Al the rest of
the day or abnormally too that you could
guarantee that that day you'd get
everything you needed and not from
vitamins but rather from like real good
Whole Foods pretty good idea right how
good would that be delicious Whole Food
burito everybody likes a burrito you
know it's got everything in it different
flavors you know we had variety of
flavors so you could get the one you
wanted great idea wasn't
it well here was problem number one
problem number one
it is impossible to get nutrition from
food that's right impossible did I say
it's difficult and you have to work
really hard nope nope it's not
possible did you know that did you know
that if you made a list of all the
minerals and nutrients you're supposed
to get during the day and then you said
I'm going to go get those from just food
I but I get eat organic food vegetabl
you know maybe really lean pieces of
meat like I'm going to eat food and get
my vitamins minerals do you know how
close you would get and let's say you're
a scientist you're you're even a
nutritionist you know exactly what to
eat to get the good stuff and you eat
nothing bad you eat all good stuff and
you eat a wheelbarrow full of it all day
long you won't even get close you will
not get close to your recommended
minimum now what you you will do is
you'll nail several things so for
example getting enough vitamin C not too
hard not too hard but if you eat a bunch
of things that give you good vitamin C
your belly will be full before you got
any of your other
whatever you actually cannot under any
circumstance no matter how educated no
matter how rich you cannot get even your
minimum of vitamins and minerals from
food not even close you'll never get
anywhere in the in the
ballpark how many of you knew
that because if you talk to your doctor
what's your doctor going to say oh you
don't need vitamins
necessarily you just eat a good balanced
diet you'll be
fine do you know that doctors don't know
anything about
nutrition I do they don't know anything
about it now that's exaggeration they do
know about nutrition but they don't they
often don't have it as a lesson in their
medical training I've heard from a
number of doctors that what they did not
learn was
nutrition what are you are you serious
you went through doctor's school without
learning about like
specifically classes on
nutrition apparently so now suppose that
got fixed suppose tomorrow we started
giving them the best science on
nutrition so that would fix it right
nope there's no such thing as science
about nutrition it's all it's
all it's all uh driven by food
companies or motivated somebody this or
bad data you know or things that haven't
been studied
really so I started my food company and
the first thing I realized is you could
not make a product that had all the
vitamins and minerals you needed you'd
have to
supplement so I thought well how hard
could that be you know add a little
supplement nice nice tight product well
it turns out you would have to add so
much supplements to get the mineral
content it would taste like you're
sucking on a piece of
rock it' be like putting tal in your
mouth
like so then we thought okay is there
any way to mask this taste and we tried
really really hard to mask it so you
know it' still be healthy for you but
you you couldn't detect
it turns out you could do it by making
it really spicy really really spicy but
if you ate it with that level of
spice you would fart so hard that your
your socks would
inflate and you literally could you
barely could you couldn't be around
people for the rest of the
[Laughter]
day let's say you could get a job uh
inflating those Chinese spy balloons
you'd be like uh oh we have a job for
you in China uh we have these big spy
balloons need to be inflated with gas
every day if you could just stand over
here eat one of these D burritos and
inflate our balloon we would be much
appreciated anyway so uh in that process
I learned that everything that we
thought was science including that you
know the food pyramid it was all wrong
every bit of it was wrong now that was
my introduction to to science being
completely made
up as time went by I became more alerted
to noticing it I learned that uh the uh
most papers that are submitted to
science half of them don't pan out and
that I learned that peer review is
basically
nothing peer review just uh eliminates
the people who who didn't have any
numbers to submit with their study I
mean just the basic stuff They Don't
Really check the
math peer review is just looking for the
very top level you know does this look
sciency or does it not look sciencey and
beyond that is probably people who are
your friends who do you think is doing
the peer review your your
Nemesis no it's your science buddy who
you know is going to give you a good PR
per review so science has been
for a long time it still works I mean
it's still better than the alternative
right but it's been mostly for
decades and continues to be so if you
were uh let's say on the side that kept
buying everything that the science told
you you would be in very bad shape you'd
be in very bad shape on the other hand
if you didn't believe anything the
science told you you'd be in very bad
shape so we're left to sort of our own
devices to figure out what's real and
what's not and so in those cases what do
you do in the in the case where you
can't trust the science what do you
do well if you're me you make all your
decisions with the Assumption of bad
data all right so what would you do on
climate if you had the Assumption of bad
data you would try really hard to
develop new forms of energy because you
would do that anyway so that doesn't
matter what your data is about for
climate change you would still do that
you would still work as hard as you
could to make Fusion Energy because it's
better
regardless you would uh you might not do
a lot for pulling uh CO2 out of the air
but on the other hand if a startup wants
to take a chance that that might be real
and essential why not it's a free market
so you let the free market do that even
if you think it probably won't work
um he grow
diamonds yeah so I try to make my
decisions on the assumption that I don't
know likewise with the vaccination I
said I don't believe anything they say
about the co virus itself I also don't
believe anything they say about the
vaccination safety or
Effectiveness so what do you
do if you don't know the danger of not
getting it and you don't know the danger
of getting it how do you make your
decision Well normally you would
minimize any introduction of additional
risk but that one's tricky because the
virus itself might have a risk if you're
not vaccinated more of a risk they say
but it might be more of a risk to have a
have a a virus plus a vaccination now
you got two things you're not so sure
about right so here's how I make the
decisions
when in the context of no believable
data here's how I
decisions for climate change you don't
make gigantic big changes to your
situation without being pretty sure you
have to so on climate change I would be
H let the free market work it out I'm
going to need a lot more information
before I Chang Society in general so
generally speaking if you don't trust
the data don't make gigantic
changes small changes just just in case
the data is right that would make sense
but a massive cultural change if you're
not
sure I I'd hold off on the
vaccinations I didn't like the risk of
the of getting the you know the original
version the dangerous version of covid
didn't like that risk and I didn't know
what it was I didn't like the risk of
getting vaccinated so that's why I
waited as long as possible and put it
off but there was one thing I knew for
sure if I didn't get the vaccination I
couldn't travel
internationally so that was my that was
my uh deal breaker or uh what' you call
it that's the one that pushed me to one
side so making decisions in the context
of really really not trusting the data
is a separate
skill and it's not the one that you
usually use the way people usually make
decisions is they decide one of the data
sets is right and that's irrational if
you you can't tell so if he decided that
the the vaccination data one way or the
other was right I don't know how you did
that you know I I don't I can't do
that
anyway um so I think believing the news
is a big problem and believing the news
on science is an even bigger problem and
I would suggest that there's a certain
type of person who is likely to believe
the news and believe the science
and those people too much are in
charge who would those people
be stop it no no stop saying that all
right
um I saw Jonathan hate uh who's got a
new book out called the anxious
generation he's talking about what are
the causes for why there's so many you
know mental health problems in young
people today and they've got all this
chaos and social problems and everything
else and apparently if you look at all
the science you can determine that there
are lots of things that could be yeah
somebody's saying the food somebody
saying the weed somebody saying the
national debt no the internet anyway but
anyway according to j8 if you look at
each of those other potential causes uh
they don't hold up
so the statistical reality of those
other things is they don't seem to be
qule but there is one thing that very
very much is right on point for
causation and it's smartphones so
smartphones
probably are exactly as dangerous as you
think and here's the interesting
thing suppose we reach a point where
every single person is completely aware
that is causing major brain damage and
destroying the lives of young people
because we're pretty close to that would
phones be
banned
nope they would
not they would
not but you know what might
happen you know what might happen when I
say might it's going to happen watch
what's going to happen you know how even
if you tried to tell your teen
oh don't go to this site or don't use
this app it's a waste of time because
they always have a way around it have
you noticed that there's always a way
around everything yeah you you know
what's going to
come
AI I'll bet you that in maybe less than
a year your devices will all have ai as
their Central to their operating system
right now the AI tends to be in an app
but what happens when the AI is is
Central to the
foundational operating system of every
device which is going to happen for
sure at that point what can the parents
do that they can't do
now you see it yet we're probably a year
away from a parent being able to say um
hey device uh I'm going to give you to
my teen and uh I'm the one in charge I
own this device and my orders for you
are to watch every
interaction and stop any interaction
that is not child
appropriate okay we'll monitor all
actions and internet traffic and prevent
them from looking at bad material now I
don't need to describe to you what would
be inappropriate to for a teen do I no I
have pattern recognition I'm well
informed about what would be bad for a
teen all right let me know if there's
anything I need to know we'll do I'll
keep you
informed now tell me I'm
wrong I'm not wrong right isn't the
whole uh smartphone problem about to get
solved but here's the
question given that I believe it would
be not trivially easy but
easyish to completely censor all smart
devices using a a you we're at a point
where now it just will travel with the
child and it just will always be there
they can't get past it now you think you
could hack it no I don't think you could
hack it if it's the operating system I
think you could hack an app if you tell
me that the children can hack the
operating system I'm going to say they
did a bad job in the operating system
they can only hack an
app that's what I think I can be wrong
right you know there there's always the
general rule that someone they can hack
anything anything can get hacked you
know maybe the kids will find their own
AI they guess around the other AI or
something like that but I've got a
feeling that if you put AI on a kid's
phone you could really really make a
difference and I think that's coming but
would Apple want to have anything that
would cause children to use their phone
less and be less addicted to
it you don't want to do it if you're
Apple
because if Android isn't doing it every
kid will ask for an Android from that
day on right Apple and Android are going
to have to what's the word for
this
collude unless it's a
law you know what maybe it needs to be a
law I don't like interfering with the
free market but when it comes to kids I
do maybe it needs to be a law that your
device has to have some kind of of AI
monitoring for teens I hate that though
I hate I hate having an extra
law but I don't see the I don't see the
competitors wanting to
themselves if the other one doesn't and
I don't think it's legal for Apple and
Google to say hey let's do this at the
same time is it would that even be legal
because that would be you know
monopolistic what do you call it
oligopoly
business cartel it'd be kind of a cartel
situation anyway I think AI is going to
uh drastically change what we're doing
to our children I hope it's for the good
uh many of you saw the viral clips of
Bill m in his Club random talking to
Seth McFarland on the situation of
vaccinations now a lot of people had a
lot of comments about it and I'm going
to give you mine number one who won the
the
debate did Seth McFarland who is
relatively Pro vaccination Co
vaccination uh win or did Bill Maher who
wasn't anti vaccination or anti-id
vaccination but rather thought they were
overdone and mandatory so even Bill Mah
says probably for the elderly and the
obese you probably gave them an
advantage so where they where they
agree is it might have been better than
bad for a certain class of people but
beyond that Seth would be more Pro
vaccination for covid at least in the
past and Bill would be you know hey
leave me alone it's my decision what to
put in my body now they're both I would
say well above average in intelligence
based on their work there's no way that
Seth is anything but smarter than
average and there's no way that bill Mah
is anything but smarter than average and
a lot you know they're not just a little
bit smarter than average both of them
are a lot smarter than average and it's
obvious in all of their
work now what do two people who who seem
to genuinely care so they care about the
issue because they both tweeted and
talked about it you know in public they
care
they're one uh Seth McFarland won the
debate kind of easily but you know it
wasn't exact contest and when I say you
won the debate hold on don't get mad at
me let me explain when I say the Seth
won the debate I mean that if you were a
viewer who didn't know anything on your
own oh we got the 34 Minute glitch weird
mystery 34 minutes in we get some kind
of technical glitch um if you did not
know anything on your own about the
vaccinations and you just saw these two
people talk you probably would have
backed
McFarland because he made his points
without sounding crazy it's just that
some of them were not
factual now here here was my take I
thought that neither of them were well
informed what did you
think in in my opinion neither of them
were well informed so I had this weird
situation of watching two people who
were both in my opinion
poorly informed on really basic stuff
like real basic you know just everybody
should know this
and this is how I see the entire
argument it's definitely true that
somebody's right and somebody's more
wrong about the benefits and costs of
vaccinations somebody's right but my
observation is this it's two groups
arguing
poorly but one of them is right and it's
not because their argument is good
because their arguments are terrible I
see terrible arguments on both sides you
almost universally almost universally
terrible arguments I don't know what I
don't know what that's all
about and I'm not getting into the
details I'm just saying it's it's my
take that it's just all terrible now
here's what I think both sides get
wrong both sides who are sure of their
opinion have decided that some of the
data is bad but there is some other data
that's
good how the hell did you come to that
conclusion that there's some good
data there's no good data even if some
of it is correct you have no way of
knowing let me say that again even if
there's some correct data on the
pandemic and vaccination even if there
is you don't know which is correct and
you have no way to know what is correct
there is no way for you personally to
know what is correct so almost all of
you have made the decision that you're
you you're looking at the correct stuff
the other people somehow missed all the
correct stuff and they're looking at the
wrong stuff I don't see any of that I
see two groups that are looking at
things they couldn't possibly know are
true or not well sometimes you can know
it's not true but you can't tell what's
true
you don't have that ability none of us
do I don't so when I made my decisions I
made it under the assumption that none
of the data is reliable in any direction
and then I guessed so when I said I'm
guessing I wanted to make sure that
later if I said I got the right answer
let's say hypothetically I could find
out I guess right I didn't want you to
say man Scott you were pretty smart I
guess you Analyze That corre correctly
cuz I didn't I didn't I couldn't there's
no way I could I just guessed because I
had to travel well I didn't have to but
I wanted
to so we're in kind of an absurdity
situation there um and I use that as my
example of why we're probably in the
simulation and I'm going to take this
down to another detail let let me take a
basic fact about the pandemic and watch
what happens in the comments watch this
true or false we now know you know
because some time has gone by we now
know with certainty true or false that
uh young healthy athletes were dropping
dead on the field at an alarming rate
that could only be related to the
vaccinations go true or false true
statement or false statement that we
know for sure at this point that
athletes were dropping like flies
because because of the
vaccination okay now you're blowing my
mind
here I'm seeing 90% false I really
thought you were going to say true I'm
seeing a lot of true all right so we
have we have enough people saying true
so check the comments if you're one of
the people saying it's true how do you
explain all the people saying it's
false and if you say it's false how do
you explain all the people saying is
true
how do you explain it let me explain it
in both
cases the people think is true and the
people think it's not true you latched
onto some data and you decided that one
of them was true and what what reason
and knowledge did you bring to decide
which ones are
true I don't
know I have no idea how you did that
how'd you do that how'd you do that I'll
tell you the best I can do since I don't
know what data is true the best I can do
is say does the data match you know
observation and anecdotal and does it
change over
time I mean there's a very few things
you can actually have some confidence of
and here's what I think all right we're
sitting here at the cusp of
2024 do you believe for those of you who
said it's true that the thetes were
dying dropping like flies for those of
you who think it was true do you think
that that story would have gone away
because it
did do you think it would just go
away I don't see how it could it would
be the most obvious noticeable biggest
story in the world if that were true
it's all we would be talking about we
wouldn't be talking about anything else
if that were
true
now
is that a good standard is my standard
that by now if such a radical incredible
horrible thing had been happening we
would know that for sure right like in
in the beginning we could be uncertain
because all you know it's fog of War
still during the pandemic we don't know
who's lying but today you don't think
today we have a pretty good handle on
whether that was
real
today yeah so I don't know for sure but
I'll tell you I live in the world in
which it never
happened I can tell you that the sources
that almost all of you used were
definitely just made up so the the
primary sources for that claim are like
one website that was you know pretty
well proven that they made up and
that they listed people who were alive
people died of other things blah blah
blah so I live in the world where that
never
happened but as you saw in the comments
there are a whole bunch of you who are
right here you you think you're living
in the same reality right I don't live
in your reality if you said yes to that
I absolutely don't live any reality but
can I say you're
wrong I can't I can't is it possible
that athletes did in fact drop like
flies and then the big Pharma was
powerful enough to cover it all
up
yeah unfortunately
yeah that is kind of possible it's kind
of possible I don't think it's likely
but if you said to me but are you ruling
that out I'd have to say no I'd have to
say no I can't rule that out you there
is absolutely a chance it happened and
that as big as and amazing as that would
be in a horrible way that somehow we
didn't know about it
right have you seen the uh the news that
they're going to study uh somebody
studied uh funeral homes and and they
found all this uh blood clotting stuff
that doesn't look like it came from a
human being you know it's like all the
their their arteries all have all these
clots how many of you believe that's
true that they that the
uh all right let's do true or false is
is it true or false that the autopsies
are showing that there's all something
clogging up their
veins
oh you're all over the place on this one
I'm seeing true and
false let I'm going to use my same
standard and it goes like
this I don't know and I have no way to
know are you okay with that that I don't
know and I have no way to find
out so how do I make the
decision I'm going to make the decision
the same
way uh I made the decision decision
about the dead
athletes do you think that by
now that wouldn't be the biggest story
in the
world if every coroner everywhere would
have the same situation right because
the vaccines and the coron virus were
Universal every coroner everywhere
they'd all notice it because apparently
it's so noticeable you cannot notice it
do you think you wouldn't know for sure
by now if every dead person had this
problem because they all
would right so I'm going to guess that's
fake but do I know no it's an educated
guess it's an educated guess based on
the fact it would be the biggest story
if it were
true I know all right uh let's move on
uh let's talk
about huh Gateway pundit is reporting
that uh one of their investigators Brian
Lupo
he looked into the claim made by georg's
Secretary of State renberger back in
2020 that they had done an audit using
forensic techniques as he says uh on the
voting machines used in
2020 and uh no problems were
found so that's good news right aren't
you glad that the secretary of state of
Georgia since there were some questions
about that state elections are you glad
that they did those audits using using
forensic
techniques to find out everything was
fine good news huh so Brian
Lupo uh did a investigative report and
he went around to ask if he find the the
readout or the uh the reports from the
audit because you'd like to see it
documented wouldn't you guess what he
found
out there's no evidence any audits were
done
oh boy oh
boy
2024 stop making me love you stop it I
don't want to love 2024 but oh God it's
looking good it's looking delicious now
let's use our
standard do you believe that this is
true because it was in the Gateway
pundit and Brian
could not find um any evidence of the
audits I don't know if he meant every
machine or if he meant a lot of machines
I don't know if that means every machine
or just some but some would be plenty of
a
problem what do you
think all right so we have one
source I would say trusting One Source
is
sketchy so I would not say that this is
confirmed number two what do I always
tell you about knowing something doesn't
exist because you couldn't find
it because that's what we're dealing
with yeah it doesn't mean it doesn't
exist because there's one guy who
couldn't get it and find it that's it's
a strong indication that you should
maybe ask more questions it's a giant
red flag but it's not
proof so I'm not going to claim that
anything has happened that will change
the our understanding of the world
but is in my
imagination it just feels like
2024 is going to reveal that the 2020
election was
rigged I feel like it's like the forces
of the universe are all lining
up like it couldn't not
happen but this is also me being
hypnotized by the media right so let let
me let me confess I am completely
hypnotized I am brainwashed by the
sources I am looking at so so look at me
confess I am not objective on this
question because I want it to happen
like it would be so
entertaining I just sort of want it to
happen it would be good for the country
if in fact there was fraud and if in
fact we uncovered it now the perfect
situation is there was no
fraud but if there was
that would be the most entertaining so
I'm not I'm not objective on this at all
so don't uh don't be too influenced by
seeing that I look like I'm certain
about it I do have a feeling of
certainty let me say that as clearly as
I can I do have a feeling of certainty
but it's just a feeling so you should
not adopt my feeling you should use your
reason all right well we'll see what
happens
there um the the redheaded libertarian
you know her account on
X uh posted this you've heard a few of
people say it I said it the other day uh
but she says do you know anyone who
actually supports Nikki Haley is this a
scop and I responded to her that uh this
is true by the way I know of one I know
of one Nikki hilly supporter who I can
guarantee is a real human being I know
one however as I as I told the
red-headed libertarian on my post uh I
do know one but he is a v
curious which is
true he's he's definitely a Haley
supporter but he's getting kind of
interested in this V fellow who keeps
saying some good
stuff isn't that funny that the only one
that I could come up with the only one
told me the other day it's like this the
fake gu is kind of
interesting all right David Axelrod as
you know he's a well-connected
um I guess consultant type for the
Democrats very uh I'd say very
influential in that world and he's
talking about the risk if uh Trump is
taking off the ballot for the elections
he says I have a very very strong
reservations
may we take a
moment to to acknowledge that's too many
uses of the word
vary one use would be too
many two uses very very too much see
what I did there all right but he has
very very strong reservations about all
this uh all of this meaning taking Trump
off the
elections he said this on CNN uh he says
I I do I do think it would rip the
country apart if he were actually
prevented from running because tens of
millions of people want to vote for him
he says I think if you're going to beat
Donald Trump you're going to probably
have to do it at the polls now when he
says rip the country
apart rip the country
apart um here's what's interesting about
Axel Rod the reason I I always recommend
him even if you disagree with his
opinions is that although he's a
unabashed Democrat you know biased
person that's all transparent like
nobody listen nobody listens to axar rod
and says I wonder if you're trying to
see it both ways or anything like that
that's not his job his job is to be on
one side but what makes him interesting
is he's not a crazy
bastard like I don't remember the last
time Axel Rod said something that was
just stupid or just not true well he's
generally he's like the the San we lost
the comments here on locals so I'm going
to call up my phone so I can see your
comments
again one
moment technical
glitch and we're back all right we got
your comments
back um yeah I think it was the app not
the browser anyway so uh Axel Rod being
conser about the country being ripped
apart um I feel like he's talking to his
base so that was
persuasion uh because that's what he
does I mean he's a Persuader and it was
persuasion for his own team and he was
basically warning his team don't do
this uh uh don't do this guys guys hey
hey
guys uh seriously don't don't do this
you don't really have any idea how bad
this is going to be uh you give me you a
little
warning uh there are 80 million people
who are heavily armed and they're not
going to be
happy yeah so listen to Axel
Rod meanwhile over in the Red Sea the
hooes are uh have made 23 attacks on
international shipping since
November 23 missiles and drones I guess
most missiles 23
attacks and has the United States yet to
flatten them no no we're just trying to
shoot them out of the air when we can
get them you know some some shipping is
being redirected around the Korn takes a
lot longer but weirdly the experts are
saying it's not going to have that much
effect on your uh Energy prices isn't
that weird that you could take that
shortcut away and you know what is it
triple probably triple the distance that
they have to ship the energy and the
experts are saying it's not going to
actually change your prices that much
it's kind of weird I don't know how that
works it could be that if you have a
tanker full of
oil you know that how much oil you use
to get it there is not the biggest issue
I don't
know
um all
right so I don't know what's going to
happen there but uh the United States is
looking kind of weak I'd like to think
that we have a reason for not attacking
a good reason for not attacking the
hoodies is we don't need yet another War
but I'm kind of surprised that the
military industrial complex hasn't made
this a thing so I think what's going to
happen is if we wind down Ukraine which
looks like there's some potential for
that happening in the coming months then
Sou suddenly it's going to be a war in
Yemen and they're just going to Crank It
Up and but at the moment it's not the
right time oh it's not the right time
but we'll get back to you later because
we need to sell some
weapons yeah all right um there's a
source talking to axios about what Trump
would do if he gets elected and who he
would fill the powerful jobs with and
the concern says a source an anonymous
source
told axios so what do we know about the
rest of the story before I tell you
because it came to axios and they don't
tell you who it was and it was an
anonymous source in the Trump
Administration and they're saying some
negative things about Trump that's right
the anonymous source is saying something
about Trump and we don't know who it was
who's saying it so that's all
true right totally true No in fact when
I put together my uh guide to how to how
to interpret the news which I haven't
finished it's in draft draft form uh
first draft very
early I said the number one thing you
should not trust is an anonymous source
in the administration or in this case in
the campaign it's the least reliable of
all things nothing is less reliable than
an anonymous source but what did they
say allegedly allegedly what they said
was that this time Trump might not try
to get all these you know General deep
State people in his administration who
will thwart him but rather he's going to
try to get all the Trump loyalists in
there and maybe the key question will be
if they believe the 2020 election was
rigged that might be like a litus test
so oh my God you've got to worry oh
everybody everybody you should worry wor
Trump will put his loyalists in in
jobs like every
president wasn't he the first one who
didn't correct me if I'm wrong but I
thought that was the basic job of
presidents putting their loyalists in
the key positions isn't that exactly
what you want them to do why would you
be afraid of that or let me tell you why
you'd be
afraid because they're going to list
specific terrible people oh these are
monsters you want to be scared let me
tell it to you like it's a like it's a
ghost story you ready hold
on I might have to take off my
microphone for
this I can reach
it we're going to go
full uh Blair Witch Project
here
to tell you about the
advisors that
Trump might try to bring
on we'll go in full dark
here Alexa turn off
studio all right we need a little
more all
right let me tell you about what the
Source says could be the
advisers try not to be
frightened try to control
yourself first name that is rumored who
might come back
Steve
[Applause]
Bon I'm just getting
started cash
[Applause]
Patel
it gets
worse step Miller attorney
general what other monsters do we have I
wish I could read it but I'm in the
dark I think you get the idea it's going
to be very very dangerous and there dare
I
say dark it's going to be
dark
all right I guess I can't milk that bit
any more than I already have Alexa turn
on
studio and there you have it The Blair
Witch
Project
commentary all right uh Sam bankman
freed as you heard
yesterday um he's uh not going to be
charged with some extra char charges you
know he he obviously is convicted but
there's some extra charges they dropped
and some people are
saying like Paul Sperry for
example uh what they wanted covered up
what risked coming out at trial oh so
some people say that maybe they dropped
these
charges because what could come out in
trial would be this is Paul sp's idea uh
is how dirty FDX funds were laundered
into the DN through something called
mind the gap a Democrat dark money op
and how the whole op was run by S spf's
Sam bagman Free's mom a radical Democrat
uh activist working under cover of
Academia in Stanford now that's a uh
hyperbolic description of what was
happening but is it
accurate I don't
know but it sounds suspiciously like it
might
be it does sound suspiciously like that
might be the reason that the charges
were dropped now it's also possible they
didn't have the goods and they've
charged them enough and it would just be
a waste of time maybe but uh I think
this other reason might be uh in the mix
well Trump uh is disagreeing with those
who don't want to build a new FBI
headquarters for a gazillion dollars and
so the idea was to move the FBI
headquarters I guess an of DC and um and
have a big new building
somewhere uh and I know that people like
Thomas Massie and I think V says this
too that maybe they shouldn't get their
big new building V would reduce the FBI
substantially and I think Thomas Massie
just says you know they don't need this
big new
building but Trump is going the other
direction according to his truth post uh
let me just say what he said and see if
you feel the same because people are
having mixed feelings about this even
Trump supporters see what you agree with
so Trump says the FBI headquarters
should not be moved to a far away
location but should stay right where it
is in a new and spectacular building so
he's in favor of them getting a new and
spectacular building the FBI
interestingly in the best location in
our now crime ridden and filthy dirty
graffiti scarred Capital they should be
in involved in bringing back DC not
running away from it especially the
violent crime an important part of my
platform for president is to bring back
restore and rebuild Washington DC into
the crown jewel of our nation we'll make
it a crime for you again don't move the
FBI all
right what do you think of
that the first thing I would say is that
the what you think of the FBI
headquarters in the move is really more
of a persuasion question
than a financial question we talk about
it in financial terms that's not really
the reason you know vake doesn't want to
be wasting money on the FBI when he's
reducing its size so you wouldn't need
that big building if he becomes
president because there wouldn't be many
people to put in it um and then Thomas
Massie is always consistent you know
that's why he's one of the ground jewels
in the government in my opinion because
he's
consistent he just s sort of goes where
the argument goes instead of the party
and he doesn't want to spend that money
we don't have that much money we get a
big debt Fair yeah you could disagree
but it's a fair point right certainly
there's room for disagreement now what
we don't
know is would that new building give the
FBI better
capabilities you know maybe part of what
they're doing is putting groups in the
same place because it would increase
their efficiency maybe they're building
a new lab because their old Labs can't
get the job right right so there might
be something in the argument we don't
know about that probably is a stretch
but maybe there's something there so
here's here's my
take um why would Trump of all people
because of his history with the FBI
let's say not being totally on his side
why would he want to build them a new
building a spectacular new building now
I get the idea about moving into DC
that's not really the controversial part
but why would he be Pro FBI
building does that make sense to
you it does to me does to me here's how
makes
sense Trump is rarely against a new real
estate
project it's just as blood if you spend
your whole life building space
spectacular new buildings and then
somebody said hey we'd like to build a
spectacular new building while you're
president what the hell is he going to
say he loves his spectacular new
buildings right so the first thing you
should say is if he's if you're a a real
estate developer world famous one you're
not going to be too anti- big
buildings especially the spectacular
ones so I think he's using it as more of
a persuasion play to not only show that
DC is crimer ridden which comes out of
his point but also I think he wants the
FBI in his
side what do you think I think
Trump is playing a game where he says if
the FBI is not on my side I can't even
do this
job I think that's where this is coming
from now compare that to VI because I
like vake you know I'm he's my choice
for president and I like Trump in his
own way and they have a disagreement on
this so who's right well maybe both in
different ways the is right they don't
need a big building if he's going to get
rid of 80% of them so if a vake has a
solid reason that has nothing to do with
real estate nothing to do with cost it's
just you don't need a new building if
you don't have many people to put in it
so that makes complete sense so if a is
consistent has a reason starts from you
know first principles explains it all
the way through to final opinion perfect
but Trump is
not he's he's not
nothing Trump is Trump so he's not
operating on that uh complete chain of
logic like V does where where V will
show you the assumptions prove they're
true connect it all and then you know
you're
done he he's working on that persuasion
level and I I suspect what he's saying
is I can't read his mind but I'm just
going to guess about when he hears V say
he could cut 80% of the staff he
probably says to himself privately you
know what that probably is pretty close
to something that would work you maybe
not 80% but I'll bet you could take a
big piece out of
it but I bet he's also
saying that if you did that you couldn't
work with them you you would basically
lose the sport of the FBI for your
entire
term and that might be a critical
problem especially if the FBI might
not be on your side to begin with so I
think Trump may have learned from his
first go round that if you don't have
the Intel people and the FBI on your
side you're just in trouble trouble
because there's just too much lawfare
you know too
many decisions that could go either way
in the in the legal legal
domain um which is the same street
number all right I don't know if that
what that comments
about anyway keep an eye on that uh I
don't think any of the people who have
an opinion on this are
crazy this is one of those this is one
of those positive situations where
you've got three separate opinions from
three separate very capable
people they're all different and they
all show their work and they kind of
make sense because you can easily agree
with Trump on this that even if you want
to cut the you know budget of the FBI
it's not going to work for you you
wouldn't be able to run the country uh
but V has a smart take Massie has a
smart take I kind of like that I just
kind of like that smart people have
Smart takes all right ladies and
gentlemen today being a semi holiday
pre- New Year's Eve situation um I will
be doing a
manave live stream tonight for those H
subscribers on
locals um I don't yet know what time
I'll do it I'm tempted to do it at 9:00
California time so it's midnight but I
might just want to do it earlier
I might just want to get it over with do
it earlier so we'll see maybe both who
knows maybe I'll do two but I'll do one
of
those in the
meantime I hope you appreciate that when
the rest of the country is making no
content for you
whatsoever that I'm here every day and
depending on what format you're using
you might not even see any
commercials um if you're on the locals
platform for example now
yeah the man cave is my safe space
although it's not that
safe um thank you I I appreciate you for
appreciating me but tomorrow
morning tomorrow morning after all the
drinkers stayed up to
midnight will I be here in the morning
at the usual
time
yes yes I will and I will be the only
live thing that isn't a stupid
parade and I will be the only host of a
uh of a let's say entertainment product
that does not have the B Team guest
host looking at you network news all
right um have I covered all the big
stories was there anything I left
out
I don't think so I think I got it all
all right let me remind you again I
think
