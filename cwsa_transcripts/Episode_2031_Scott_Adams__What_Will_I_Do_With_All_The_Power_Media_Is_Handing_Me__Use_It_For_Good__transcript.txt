good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization the
best thing that's ever happened to
anyone
and a
uh
yep you're you're already private over
our locals don't worry
today
well we got some stuff to talk about
today how many people are here
to look at the train wreck
train wreck anybody anybody how many of
you are from the media I'm talking to
YouTube now how many are from the media
looking to get a new quote for your
story
um well we're going to talk about that
it might be a little surprised
but first what you need to enjoy this uh
situation maximally is you eat a cup of
mugger glass at tanker jealous or Stein
I can't team jugular flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
uh Scott have you ever taken acid
no I am acid
that was a pretty good answer I feel
like I should say that with more uh more
theatrical Flair let me try that again
oh there's a comment Scott have you ever
taken acid
I am acid
yeah that didn't work did it that didn't
work
I really had high hopes for that but
didn't land
all right uh
better check the news
oh my God I am the news
you know
if you ever get in trouble
here's some advice for you some of you
you know sometimes get in trouble as I
do
you need to time your trouble
for not a salon Newsweek it's a super
slow Newsweek they're only the only
thing they're covering is train
derailments it's like we got Ohio
and the other Trains being derailed
let's see
um yes the cartoonist he's being
derailed okay we're kind of on a
derailment theme this week it's all we
got it's all we got
anyway so I got a fun tweet by uh we'll
talk about all that unless more people
stream in first
so a fun tweet from Benjamin Carlson
he's a writer on Twitter uh well he's on
Twitter he's also a writer
um he says in the CIA interrogation
manual it lists coercive techniques used
to break someone's will they include
now before I read the list of things
that the CIA uses to break people's will
ask yourself how many of these apply to
people using social media
all right
isolation
dependence
inducing guilt
preying on fear
disrupting sleep
robbing basic dignity
depriving of natural light
so so as Benjamin notes sounds like
social media addiction it's exactly a
social media addiction
yeah the I like I'm not making it up
this is the actual list
of the cia's coercion techniques and
they all sort of coincidentally or not
or not they all coincidentally map to
social media usage and addiction
do you think that your will is being
broken down by social media
do you think that today for example well
let's just take today randomly
if you check the news would you find out
that the news didn't look like real news
it looked like
some kind of social media narrative
poisoning
yeah Jack
that's what it looks like
well
is anybody here to talk about me
have you ever been sick of yourself
does that ever happened
have you ever been so full of just
talking about yourself or hearing about
yourself
that you're just tired of it
like I swear to God I haven't read any
of the articles about me and there are
quite a few
quite a few articles about me today I
haven't read any of them
but it's not because you know I don't
want to see bad news or anything like
that it's because I'm just so bored
like I'm so bored of all the NPCs
writing the same story you know without
context of course
so those of you are paying attention let
me ask you first how many of you who are
watching
uh saw the uh one hour plus uh podcast I
did with uh hotep Jesus
which explains the whole drama
so a lot of people in locals okay how
many of you YouTubers sought
a lot of you okay quite a few of them
all right good yeah I mean it's a lot to
ask of anybody to watch it you know over
an hour of a podcast so the fact that so
many of you actually put in
that much time
for something that was meaningful to me
actually makes me feel good thank you
for that I appreciate that quite a bit
that that is really a lot of time to put
in for somebody else's issue so I do
appreciate that now you may notice those
of you who have seen the hotel Jesus
thing if you watch that you know the
whole story
if you if you're not aware of that or
you didn't watch it you're you're living
in a whole different reality
and the reality you're living in is
defined by this Scott
I saw you say it it's on video you said
it boom there's nothing else to know
and then there's people who saw the
video say no kind of the whole story
Etc
they're living in completely different
worlds
about me
right
those of you who have seen the video
would you agree or disagree with the
following statement
anybody who's seen the hotep Jesus video
they're half a million people have
viewed it already if you've seen it you
would have a completely different
impression of all of the situation agree
or doubt
on locals everybody say yes all right
now look also on YouTube yep all right
so if there's anybody here who hasn't
seen that video but you've formed an
opinion what do you think now
I'm not even telling you what your
opinion should change too I'm saying
just look at the comments
basically it looks like a hundred
percent of the people who saw the the
context
have a different view of the whole
situation
now ask yourself
which members of the media
are aware of the full context probably a
number of them watched it before they
wrote yesterday
but as anybody seen any coverage which
uh left out that context
has anybody seen any coverage that
omitted the context
and would you say that that was
accurate news or fake news
how how many uh how many news stories or
tweets about me uh listed the reason
that I said what I said that offended
everybody
how many lists did the reason I said
like why did you say that Eddie
now did any of you who read the news
about me did you catch
that they didn't list the reason
if you don't list the reason
it reverses the story
here and by the way this is this is how
a lot of fake news gets created if you
take a a snippet
it's the way the you know it's exactly
the way that fine people hoax was
created you cut out the part where Trump
says I'm not talking about the neo-nazis
they should be condemned totally you
just cut that out and it reverses his
meaning
same with drinking bleach Oaks if you
cut out the part where he says I'm
talking about light as a disinfectant it
reverses the meaning and it sounds like
some chemical disinfectant it's the same
way the Covington kids hoax was played
you just cut out the context of just
what happened right before and it
reverses the meaning
so if you saw my uh by the way did you
see how how uh it's being branded my
story
so all the media picked up the same
phrase
it's either a racist rant
or a racist tirade
now if you saw a racist rant and racist
tirade what would you assume is the
reason I said it
you would assume the reason I said it is
that I have a negative feeling
about Black Americans wouldn't that be
kind of a natural interpretation because
it's just that in a context if you saw
it in context
in the comments if you saw it in context
was it me saying bad things about black
people and therefore you should stay
away from did that happen
nope no
no what was the context
the context is far too many black
Americans have a negative opinion of
white Americans
and in general as a life advice you
shouldn't spend time with people who you
know let's say in a statistical sense
are going to have a negative opinion
about you it's a bad life strategy
that's all
so how many of you got that context
without without watching the video
right do you see how easy it is for the
deuce to reverse the point of it now ask
yourself this this is the fun part
somebody asked me Scott if you wrote
this movie
in the sense that you do exactly what
you were doing when you said it which of
course I did of course I did you know if
I had just started my life in Media you
could say to yourself I feel like you
just had a bad day
right like he just had sort of OJ day he
just had one bad day and then you could
reveal his inner soul and stuff like
that I don't make mistakes
I don't think I've ever made a mistake
in public
maybe maybe a few times when I first
started out but eventually you get good
at it and you don't say things you don't
mean and you don't say things without
knowing completely how it's going to be
taken and what impact it would be
so at this point in the story
including the cancellations because I'm
almost fully canceled from newspapers
now but including the cancellations this
was all predictable
and I knew it when I said it
and I was okay with it
I'm okay with it I actually had a good
day yesterday
I'm having a good day today
um
you know I can explain more about that
but the the hotep Jesus interview is
great by the way let me give a little
commercial for hotep Jesus and if you if
you're looking for the video it's pinned
at the top of my Twitter feed today
but you could just Google my name and
hotel Jesus and it'll pop right up
a hotel does a great show
I'm sitting there on his podcast and the
whole time like I'm talking to him I'm
thinking
damn it how did you how did you get all
this pulled together like his set is
really good and the lighting is perfect
he's got this nice background you know
he he has some kind of artist he works
with to do the the images that promote
it and like he had he had this great
image of me that you know that went with
the podcast got it all together in like
just a few hours had me scheduled I'm on
there
uh he's got like 550
000 views
great show really great show and also a
great interview I know so let me say
that first the the questions and just
the the vibe of it just terrific so if
anybody gets a chance to go on a show I
recommend it highly
good job
all right
so here's some other things you need to
know or maybe you don't care
um so you saw some stories about big
newspapers canceling Dilbert I know the
Washington Post I think the LA Times
Cleveland Plain Dealer let me explain
the economics of cartooning
there are thousands of newspapers around
the world who could potentially carry a
comic
Dilbert was in basically almost all of
the ones that matter at least
domestically and then a number of
international
but the the economics are that the big
newspapers are 80 of your income
so the 20 of the papers are 80 of the
income
the 20 that are the the important ones
are the urban Big City Newspapers now
they're the ones who are going to cancel
first for obvious reasons
and they have
so probably already what's announced
might be 80 of my income which would be
the end of you know the end of Dilbert
of course now it wouldn't be the end of
it
um
as a cartoon but it would be the end of
it in newspapers because it wouldn't it
wouldn't make sense to continue making
them for newspapers
but
there are other avenues
where Dilbert could go
for example the locals platform
subscription
but uh if the cancellation goes away I
hope
I will be the first free person in the
United States
uh I guess I was going to say Jordan
Peterson but he's Canadian
so I guess there's one free person in
Canada
you've heard of him Jordan Peterson
uh and so I'm hoping to be the first
free person in the United States
now you're saying yay
but yay actually said something that I
think all of us are scratching our heads
about
like is there any other way to interpret
that I don't know so he's in a different
situation
uh my situation is unique in the
following way
I don't know and this is act four by the
way I'm gonna I'm gonna preview
there's no act for but the end of act
three let's say
here's what the end of act three looks
like
the people who are my critics
realize they don't agree don't disagree
with me
have you noticed there is zero
disagreement from anybody black or white
in fact most of the agreement is coming
from black people have you noticed that
if you haven't noticed you will
and the agreement comes in two forms
one form is black people saying I'm a
horrible horrible person you know and I
should be canceled
that's my point
that's my point
thank you yes my point is that there are
way too many as a percentage I don't
know the percentage but whatever it is
is too high I think you'd agree of black
people who have a very negative opinion
of white people
that was my point
so the the ones who are yelling at me
and also black
are making my point now I know you're
going to say but Scott is because you
did that thing no it isn't that you can
tell by the comments that there's a it's
not just about me it's pretty obvious
um secondly there are uh black almost
entirely men I don't know if there's a
reason for that but there are a number
of black men we're just saying oh I
totally agree with you
you know in context everything you said
makes perfect sense
have you seen that have you seen the
number of black men
who are willing to say yeah once I see
your point in context
I agree
but have you seen any newspaper that
canceled me that disagreed with my point
you haven't have you now I haven't read
them I haven't read all the stories but
I can predict with confidence that none
of them disagreed with me do you know
why
because nobody would disagree with it
it's literally not disagreeable it would
be like do you like to breathe oxygen
well I don't know I don't like the way
you said it
but do you like to breathe oxygen I do
not like the way you said it yeah but do
you like to breathe oxygen you see
what's going on right
um here's the second one you ready for
this one
you're gonna love this one
I'm going to start asking my biggest
critics
the demographics of their own
neighborhood
do you love that
[Laughter]
how much do you love that
and and the funny thing is the the Trap
the Trap is like a mile wide right it's
the most obvious trap you could ever set
and watching the NPCs walking into it
and say go file oh
hey you racist oh
God damn cartoonist racist oh
I asked a few people on Twitter and and
nobody was living in a in a black
neighborhood
now of course they can explain it by
saying well
that's because I wanted to be near my
family to which I say
exactly
exactly you wanted to be near your
family do you know why
your family doesn't hate you
right now the the biggest criticism I'm
getting
uh I I just unblocked sticks by the way
so sticks and Hammer
big thank you big thank you to you and
uh all is
always uh I won't say forgiven because
that that imagines that I have some like
right to forgive or something like I
don't have like I'm not God I'm not God
so I'm not going to say you're forgiven
like I'll leave forgiveness to other
people other entities
but uh sticks and Hammer
thank you
sincere thank you
and uh unblocked and appreciated
now
um
okay
so the narrative poisoning is getting
pretty bad so here's what I think uh
sometime around the end of this week or
maybe sooner could be as soon as like
is that
it's gonna be as soon as tuesday-ish
The Narrative is going to start to to
drift
The Narrative right now
is raises rant racist rant
or racist tirade I think CNN's calling
it
everybody else is calling it a rant
so because people think in bumper
stickers
you're 80 of the world is not going to
know anything except those two words
racist rant race is rant but some but
the smart people somewhere around
Tuesday are going to say
I wonder if there's something to this
conversation
I wonder if we should start paying
attention let me call here and it's
starting to happen on social media
because at the moment at the moment
there are a lot of people who agree
who don't want to step into the fire
but little by little there are people
who do agree and really everybody agrees
there's nobody who disagrees
and by the way when I say nobody
disagrees
the point nobody disagrees with is that
if you suspect a group of people has bad
feelings about you you should put some
distance between you and that group
now that has nothing to do with black
people specifically
it has to do with a general rule right
and if you're black you should do the
same thing if you think there's a bunch
of racist white people around
stay away I wouldn't try to fix them
I wouldn't try to fix them with your you
know with your good character and you
know friendliness I would just get away
so it's the same drug it's the same
literally the same advice I give to
everybody just get away from all the bad
stuff and go toward the good stuff
vegan better says wow you were so messed
up but vegan do you disagree
do you disagree do would you advise the
opposite that if there's a group of
people who by some let's say alarming
percentage whatever you think that is I
you could reasonably assume they don't
like you would you say you should spend
more time with them or less
I'm open to your opinion go ahead
more time with people who don't like you
or less
yeah yeah literally nobody literally
nobody disagrees with me
vegan says I'm in shock but I shouldn't
I was a huge fan but vegan again do you
see that you're not addressing the only
question
you're you're mad about the way I said
it
let me say this
I don't believe people are mad at me
I think that they you know interpret it
that way it has here's what I think I
think people are mad that I held up a
mirror to everybody
black and white
right I basically said here's the mirror
look in this mirror are you living in a
black neighborhood
are you
some of you are but
who Who's Who advises people to go hang
out with people that don't like them
who does that nobody nobody so
here's how people's minds are going to
eventually settle but not everybody this
will always be bifurcated because the
people who saw the contacts have a
different opinion but for the people who
saw the context here's how their minds
are going to settle
they're going to settle on that was
really alarming when I heard it
but I have a better understanding of why
it was alarming
why it's alarming is that the situation
is so bad
that would slip down
would you agree the reason it's alarming
is not because I said it
is alarming because you agree
that's the only reason it's alarming
could you imagine if I'd said something
that people disagreed with
if people disagreed
there wouldn't be any energy around it
think about it
you see things all day long that you
disagree with do they stick in your head
not usually
not usually because you're surrounded by
things like all day long people disagree
with you like you can spend an hour on
Twitter looking at opposite opinions and
you'll just sort of Come Away with a
general idea that some people disagree
opinions you don't agree with don't
stick in your head because there's so
many of them the reason I'm causing so
much trouble
is because everybody agrees
and what is a way to hide your agreement
what would be a way to conceal your
agreement with me
what would be a way to do that
outrage
cancellation
right the newspapers who are canceling
me are trying to put some distance
between my opinion and my opinion they
agree with
because they do agree with me everybody
who canceled me agreesably
everyone
does anybody does anybody disagree do
you think that any of the cancellers the
newspapers let's say do you think any of
them disagree with my point
no they're canceling me because they
agree with my point
do you get that
so that's what that's what the
realization is going to come to in the
next few days it's going to take a while
it's like a it's like a slow-moving
thing but once people realize that I got
canceled
because they agree with me there is no
other reason
there really isn't now nobody would have
said something like you know
directly you know anti-some another
group and expect to survive but I didn't
I did not say something anti about any
group
or at least nothing that doesn't apply
to all groups right every group has the
same issue there's some people in every
group you probably want to you know
avoid certainly certainly you'd want to
avoid you know racist white people
wouldn't you
everybody would
somebody says by book launch will be
nuclear I don't know if I'm going to
have the book launch
this will be interesting because my I
don't know if my publisher is watching
this maybe
but um so I have one publisher or
syndication company that handles the
comic strip
they also do the reprint books and the
calendars and then there's another group
that does my non-dilbert books
penguin
but I haven't I haven't heard from them
because it's the weekend I haven't heard
from The Syndicate either
I'm feeling sorry for my my editor
at my Syndicate they're waking up to
this news like oh
all right
um
sick and mental issues
yeah
so
let me show you a
something I saw the ears like so already
social media is starting to debate the
issue
which is what I'd hoped
um here's
uh here's a graph I don't know if it's
real let's say internet graph you see a
spiking up there in on the end
so this is the the major entities
including uh two of them that canceled
me Washington Post at LA Times so here
is their mentions of racism
so this is the mentions of racism
grow up through the roof
did you know that
now
with this much talk of racism what would
you expect would be the predictable
result of black American feelings about
white people what would be the obvious
outcome to that negative right
if this were reversed
and let's say I were black
in this situation I would have a
increasingly resentful feeling about
white people
because have I mentioned that the media
assigns your opinions
but one of the themes that everybody
missed about my criticism is who I
blamed
did anybody see who I blamed
who did I blame
for my racist tirade I mean other than
myself of course
yeah did I blame Black America
did anybody hear me say there's
something wrong with black people nope
because I don't think there is
in my opinion black American opinions
make perfect sense
perfect sense if black Americans have a
negative feeling about white Americans
well
you know you don't have to be a genius
to figure out why
you all of our opinions are assigned by
the media and always have been not just
on this you know I'm not saying this is
the one topic that people assigned to
know your opinions are always assigned
by the media
so during this time where things were
let's say bad but not horrendous did you
hear me say stay away from black people
it wouldn't have made any sense
that would not have been a rational
thing to do
but what about at the top of this curve
when you're at the top of this curve
does it make sense to stay away from the
people who have been riled up to hate
you
who riled them up did black people rile
themselves up well I don't know but I
know that the media did
so I blame the media
as well as
as well as all the three-letter uh
things are going on now there was one
other that I needed to show you
how in the world did that disappear
there we go
so there's a lot of complaints about the
Rasmussen poll
which I believe was scientifically
accurate the Rasmussen poll but maybe
the way they asked the question was open
to not maybe it was open to to debate
but here's a poll from Gallup
that goes through 2021 and the question
was would you say relations between
white and black people are very good
some are good
some are bad or very bad and and here's
the trend line
so the trend line
uh if you see things are you know oh you
know things are not good
not good I mean could be a lot worse
oops boom right to the toilet
so you saw two graphs one says that the
media is mentioning racism over and over
and over again
and then you see that the public is
responding in lockstep
in lockstep to the reporting
now let me ask you this
was this when racism got the worst
like in the history of the United States
was this about the time when all the
racism got worse
because in the world I live in the
actual discrimination was at its lowest
point
was it not
I think it was at his lowest point but
the media was telling you it was at its
highest point and both white and black
people were totally buying that
narrative
no I think Trump you know the Trump era
was the biggest part of that probably
so
all of the data
that I've seen
agrees with me
any do you have any doubt about that
would you would you accept that the data
and all of your anecdotal experience
both both of your lived experience and
the data what do you agree they're all
on the same side
that the media has poisoned us
I called it out and then what happened
to me
what happened when I called out the
media poisoning us
I got canceled by who
the news the news canceled me to hide
the fact that they did this they did
this
they made it impossible for a white
person to feel comfortable around a
black person
let me modify that
not a person right you need to deal
every single individually you know every
person should be dealt with individually
so I'm by no means suggesting you should
avoid black people if you got that if
you got that as some kind of a universal
thing you missed the point
so individuals
you should never discriminate against
and by the way
I rarely run into racism with anybody I
know
do you have that experience
like my the actual racism that I
experience like in my daily life it's
like zero basically it's only a media
phenomenon
but the media has certainly caused
people who don't know each other to have
bad feelings right here here's an
example
just think in your head let's say if
you're white or black uh just stuck in
your head of the whiter black people
that you know personally
and ask ask yourself do you have any
racism problems
no no I mean if you do you need a new
friend but not really
not really I mean I've never had any
kind of racism problem in person
but if I were to let's say uh be
introduced to a group of black Americans
especially after the news this week
would I feel comfortable with a group
not an individual
no I wouldn't feel comfortable at all
nope but would I have any problem with
any one person in that group
maybe for about five minutes
meaning that anybody who talks to me for
five minutes
it gets a really good reading of what
I'm about right you don't even have to
talk about race in five minutes you
would know that you don't have a problem
with me
it would be obvious
right
so in person people are pretty good it's
just the media has decided that we're
groups which we didn't decide
the media decided we're different groups
you know why does the Gallup poll show
up show a black versus white Felix
they're dividing us
they divide us because it's easier to
make news out of it if they said Well
everybody's the same why would we do a
poll of what black versus white people
think what's the point of that
everybody's people
then you would end up starting treating
everybody like people
but if every time you turn up the new
pick up the news the Gallup poll is
separating people into black and white
what are you going to do
you're going to do the same thing right
so the division is caused by
the media and there's and I've seen zero
disagreement
is there anybody who disagrees with my
point
is there anyone who says no the media
does not influence our feelings about
each other
right nobody says that
literally nobody
so here are the two macro stories
that are sort of related to my story
number one
uh in Dilbert I often
talk about the fact that your boss
your boss is the one who gets to judge
your work
even if your boss is the one that causes
you to fail
do you ever go into a performance review
with review with your boss your boss
says you did not get this project done
now you say but I didn't have a budget
because you didn't complete the budget
thing
and then your boss says you're fired
because your boss gets to not only judge
you for the mistakes the boss made
but then the boss can fire you for the
mistake that the boss made
now let's look at my situation
who is my boss well I have a boss per se
but the clients are basically my boss
like in a conceptual way
so the newspapers
CNN Reuters all these people created a
situation which I pointed out
and then the people who created that bad
situation
they rallied together instantly and as
one
they canceled me
because the last thing you want to find
out is what they did to you
but by the end of this week
You're Gonna Know
you're going to know they did this to
you they divided the country
they created the situation and when I
acted rationally in the situation they
created they canceled me
as one
now here's the second part of this
do you think that the Washington Post
was unaware
that I'm one of the most effective
voices in politics
what do you think
do you think they were unaware
do you think they were unaware that I
was one of the most effective voices
helping Trump get elected
of course they know that
have you noticed that anybody who had
any let's say political
influence is getting canceled one by one
now I don't think that's the major story
that's not the major story but I don't
know that I would have been canceled if
I had been pro-biden do you think so do
you think the Washington Post would have
canceled me or would they have looked at
the context
um
suppose I'd been black
suppose I'd been black
said exactly what I said
do you know that Jesse Lee Peters
who tweeted he says I'm 100 right he
said the same thing
so if Jesse Lee Peters wrote a
editorial let's say he got picked up
somewhere would he get canceled
or supposedly reversed it and said you
know don't spend time with white people
who are racists which would be good
advice don't spend time with white
people if you think there's a bunch of
racists then that would be good advice
keep away from white people
would it be a racist rant if I said
black people for their own good should
probably stay away from white people
because there's so many racists
the trouble is it doesn't work in both
directions because you can't really
avoid white people
just to damn many of us
you can't really avoid anybody right let
me ask you this how many people thought
that was a literal statement when I said
you should avoid black people the
context being that there are too many of
them who don't like you
that being the reason
how many thought that was literal like
nobody should I was advising you if you
if you go to the store and there's a
black black person working the cash
register don't go there do you think I
meant that
do you think I do you think I meant
don't hire
uh black people
you know discriminating against
individuals is just bad strategy
all right I I try to give strategy
advice for your careers and your life
that would make sense statistically
does it make good statistical sense to
discriminate against an individual for
race or anything else
no because all you're doing is reducing
the pool of uh of talent for yourself
right your self-interest
should take care of that like unless
you're an idiot I mean one of the
problems with race discussions is that
it gets uh conflated with idiots
right an idiot
would not interview somebody maybe for a
racial reason
a smart person would say well this could
be the best employee I've ever had you
don't know
so I better find out
so anybody who you know does something
that hurts themselves by reducing their
own options in life like that is that
racism or is that just stupid
you know if you just start reducing your
own options in life
like I suppose you never dated anybody
outside of your own ethnic group
I mean I feel like you're just reducing
your own options
all right um
so so the the people who want to be
critical of me they can't do it with my
actual argument
that's the the theme they all have to
change it to something that I wouldn't
say so here's Spencer doing this Spencer
Williams he says Scott might hire you
meaning black people uh if you're black
just don't live next to him did I say
that
does that sound like something I would
say
no it's not about individuals
my neighbors are awesome I don't live in
a in a super white neighborhood by the
way
if if you count all ethnicities you know
we have a lot of Asian Indian
uh a little bit of black it's not very
black year
but uh
it's a racist topic
yeah they don't really care what I
actually said that's not gonna
factor into it all right let me just uh
summarize that last statement I do
believe that my politics and my race are
big factors in getting canceled
but the bigger factor I feel there's no
way to read everybody's minds and you
know every everybody's everybody
everybody's a little different but
um
yeah Jesse Lee Peterson did defend me
that's true
which is very nice of him I appreciate
it a lot of other people did too by the
way you don't see the private messages I
get
privately
a lot of no I won't say a lot but
several of my black friends who follow
me on Twitter
have first of all asked for context
which which actually tells you that they
follow me
anybody who follows me
uh if they don't ask for context of the
story I'll think they're not really
following me like that's the first thing
you should ask it's like this looks
terrible
what am I missing like that's the
question I was getting privately this
looks really bad can you explain this
and then I would Point them to you know
hotep's Hotel Jesus's podcast and then
they'd come back and they'd say okay I'm
good
I'm good
once you hear the full context
people said okay I get it let's see what
I see what you're doing there
all right let's see
if there's anything else oh so here's
the thing
so social media is handing me a lot of
power
you get that right
so uh as as I anticipated of course yeah
this none of this is unpredictable so
there's something an insane amount of
energy my way
um so the new the newspaper business
will be basically over I think in a week
probably I mean my guess is that they
won't come back
but
there are a few things happening already
number one
my number of subscribers on the locals
platform
uh has shot up dramatically
um number two my Twitter followers have
shot up faster than that anytime since
I've been on Twitter
and my name recognition is going through
the roof
and the the media interest in me is
insane it's like my phone was just like
going crazy yesterday
and you see the and you see the energy
that I'm being given
what should I do with this power
or what do you think I planned to do
with this power because obviously I knew
it was coming
what should I do
now doing doing more podcasts is just
more of the same
vegan the dogs hear your whistle vegan
it's not a whistle I said it directly
see the the people who can't catch up
with the story are having a tough time
so vegan meta is yes the dogs heard your
whistle meaning racist dog whistle it's
not a racist dog whistle I told you
exactly
what the thinking was and why
there's not much to
there's there's not a whole lot there
for interpretation
like I didn't leave anything out you
don't need to any whistles it's all
right there
all right
is today Easter Sunday
what is Easter did I miss Easter already
oh it's in April
was Ash Wednesday this Wednesday
I'm not good with my religious holidays
oh so it was just Ash Wednesday
what is the ash for
what's that stand for
for Lent
all right that's how poorly educated I
am on religion
all right
um
ladies and gentlemen would you agree
that all the news is boring today let me
tell you about Ukraine blah blah the
ukrainians got some new weapons blah
blah the Russians are counter-attacking
blah blah or high Mars are very uh
accurate blah blah it's winter blah blah
this town got taken or maybe it didn't
or maybe Wagner is mad at Putin blah
blah there's nothing there
there's just nothing there
I gave up Dilbert for Lent
how about that uh Ohio train derailment
let me check let me check
still derailed
still derailed yeah so there's no news
so that has a lot to do with
um
what's going on
I guess uh some new was it that some
department or something in the U.S
decided that the covid virus was a lab
leak but they won't tell us where
the ashes symbolize our humility before
God and our recognition that we are
mortal
okay
um
yes I am to answer your question I am
um I'm at the moment and I'm subject to
change at any time right uh
yeah
I forgot my point I was just reading it
oh about Vivek
um I'm open to changing my
recommendation for president at any time
because I'm only a single issue voter on
Fentanyl and right now he's the toughest
on Fentanyl
uh uh a lot of anti-Semitic comments on
here
I I haven't seen them but I do not
approve of that
no anti-Semitism please we don't want to
see that
by the way there's a way more
anti-semitism
uh
lease on social media than I've ever
seen in person
like if you only saw social media
you'd have a real distorted view of what
actual people think I think
who would destroy the cartels harder
than Trump the trouble is it's uh that
Trump's
uh ability to get something done is
hindered by the fact that he's Trump
so I see what you're saying if he had if
he had the full power to do whatever he
wanted
he would get it done like I do believe
that he has the right you know fortitude
and judgment to get it done but I don't
know that he will be as free to do what
he wants I guess it would depend
on the nature of Congress
you know it could be that it might not
it might not matter
that Vivek has a better fentanyl or a
stronger fentanyl approach
because if he doesn't go through the
primaries
I'm gonna have to go with who does
How Deeply into our government have the
cartels burrowed
I think they probably have a lot of
influence on the border police
departments
already and I wouldn't be surprised if
they've got somebody in Congress by now
by now
never know
Anthony says in all caps you're a trump
Mega guy for sure well first of all I've
never been Maga
I don't know if people know that but
Maga I never identified with
and never never wore the hat I don't use
the I don't know if I maybe I once
hashtagged it or something in the very
beginning but I never liked it
part of it is because it sounds like
maggot
part of it it sounds like you're in a
cult as opposed to just talking about
politics so I never embraced the Maga
thing now a lot of the people who are
who are mad at me believe that I'm
right-wing how many of you believe I'm
right-wing I'm actually left-wing well
my audience is right wing how many how
many think I'm right wing
Anthony does
but look at the other comments Anthony
yeah you see that the people who
know me the best know that I'm not
you'd see more of that on the hotep
Jesus podcast that I'm recommending
yeah
well uh to be more specific I'm left
wing on social stuff but on economics
and Military stuff uh I think the right
is closer to the you know practical
smart Solutions
so on the big stuff I tend to be uh well
it depends what you call Big on the on
the domestic social stuff
um
I'm very liberal
and on anything that's like the the
health of the whole country like the
economy your defense then I get real
conservative
in the sense that uh
I'm gonna you know treat America number
one
do your Ex-Wives support you are you
really asking me that
you have no idea who I am do you
I think somebody thinks I'm somebody
else
all right yeah right wing is not an
actual right right wing is not uh
a good description for anything
I'm a kept man
that that position is libertarian yeah
maybe
did I see axios today no
it was actually it was about me or
something else
it was about me
has anybody written a balanced article
in which they seem to understand the
context
have you seen that yet
must said the media is racist
I didn't say that
oh the Washington Examiner
when did he say the media is racist did
he say that related to something I
tweeted
did that just happen
all right hold on I gotta look at that
that would be funny
do you know the term deus ex machina
all right
let me go to my feed here
let's see damn it
do you know it's hard to use any kind of
an app when people are watching all
right Elon Musk let's see what he said
tweets and replies
uh
through the media is racist
oh my God oh my mother musk went after
it he goes first of all this was eight
hours ago and it was uh it was in reply
it was in reply to
the news stories about me getting
canceled and most says the media is
racist
and then an hour later so this would be
seven hours ago he said for a very long
time U.S media was racist against
non-white people now they're racist
against White sedations
oh my God same thing happened with Elite
colleges and high schools in America
maybe they can try not being racist
oh my God
all right let me explain what the news
ex machina is how many of you know what
that is
I know I've got a lot of smart viewers
how many of you know some of you do news
ex machina
all right so the the history of it is in
the old-timey was it the Greeks the old
Greeks who would have plays I think it
was the Greeks and it's Latin yeah and
when the the writers were bad writers
they'd write a story and they'd get to
sort of the end of the play and there
was no way to resolve whatever the
problem was because they hadn't written
it well so they just have a god appear
at the end who had nothing to do with
the play and God Appears and fixes
everything
so it's considered not only a historical
reference but an insult to bad writers
like a bad writer has like a magic
person up here at the end to solve
everything but there are a lot of movies
that have some version of that
for example if you were watching a
Marvel superhero movie and all the the
superheroes that were the stars of the
movie are all like at the edge of death
and the bad guy is going to kill them
all with one hammer below and then
suddenly a new superhero that you'd
never heard of
appears in the in the movie and then you
know kills the bad guy that would be
deus ex machina like just suddenly
introducing somebody who wasn't part of
the story
well that's Elon Musk he is literally
the number one voice in the country
about free speech and he just waited
pretty hard
so let me give this a tweet
oh my God I did not expect him to go
directly at it
I did not expect that he wouldn't write
at it
good for him
wow
all right let's see what else has
happened
uh
uh getting messages
no FedEx package
all right
um I'm afraid that this might not be
your
Fisk access this uh provocative question
in all caps Fisk says why are Jews
exempt from ridicule Scott
Well everybody's exempt from ridicule
for their for their nature or the way
they were born
did you not catch that rule you
shouldn't be making fun of
anybody for the race or ethnicity or
religion or stuff they can't change well
I guess you could change that but not
not how you were born
um
it's not about
it's not about some group is free from
ridicule all groups are free from
ridicule
except maybe white people at the moment
do I have a message for your young
readers that's funny this is vegan meta
asking that question after you've
insulted me for like 20 minutes
did I uh read no I didn't read Charlie
sheon's where is that where does that
appear Charlie is do you say chion
c-h-e-o-n
sue them for a defamation that never
works
all right
do you think YouTube will cancel you
um I was surprised they didn't so here's
here's the thing the way YouTube handles
uh
cancellation
is that there's a mechanical way they do
it if they see a keyword they don't like
but then you can ask for a human review
any human who reviewed it is unlikely to
have a problem because they would have
seen it in context
so that's probably why I didn't get
canceled
oh yeah you're right vegan
it's Sunday so they'll probably cancel
me on Monday yeah that's possible I can
get canceled on Monday on YouTube
but that's why Rumble exists that's why
that's why locals exists
and so often
um
yeah they're the trolls
uh Charlie itchian is on YouTube okay
thank you
you have a more favorable view I think
yeah you know what uh you know what
population has been totally silent maybe
and maybe Charlie gianism is the
exception I feel like the Asian American
Community just went silent
am I right
have you heard anything from the Asian
American community on this topic which
by the way is the right play
yeah the right play is just lay low
let the cartoonist handle this one for
you
let him do this one
Europa the last battle never heard of it
uh 10 is the answer 10.
well
we'll see
oh boy you're right
oh God you're right
I'm not going to read that comment but
you're so right
well I think I'll be eating home for a
while
it's obvious you're pushing to be
canceled is it
all right it looks like
we've had our fun here I'm gonna go do
something else
I'm hoping that we'll have more to talk
about tomorrow when the news is not
about me but I feel like tomorrow it's
going to be more about me
because tomorrow the most of the
cancellations will send now keep in mind
there are a lot of people who don't read
a newspaper on the weekend
so a lot of people I saw one newspaper
where where the Dilbert strip goes it
says like new comic coming
so there's a whole bunch of people
waking up today to say hey what happened
to my comic and they're they're just
going to be getting into the story today
so there's like there's going to be a
second and third wave of people who are
just finding out what the story is
well I'll be the story unless there's a
bigger story is there anything big this
Brewing
will you publicly post everyone who
cancels you too many of them
yeah too many by the way do you know
what's going to happen to the economics
of the newspapers that canceled me
here's a little uh here's a little uh
inside knowledge about the comic
business
have you noticed that Comics can last
like for 50 years and 75 years
and there's very few things like that
like there are very few musical artists
or actors or anything who can you know
last 50 years Dilbert's like 34 years
old something like that 34 years the
reason that a comic lasts so long in the
newspaper is that they're addicting
and the people who have like a daily
habit
they're used to having their cup of
coffee you know it's older people now of
course and and you know it's just their
little habit is always the same if you
take a major part of their habit
and of their their habit
they complain like crazy
and they also cancel newspapers
so here's the number that they won't
report
the number of newspapers that get
canceled because they canceled Dilbert
little known fact
almost nobody ever cancels a newspaper
subscription just because of a comic
the exceptions are the top comics right
people will cancel if you take uh
Garfield down they will cancel if you
take Dilbert or anything maybe you know
maybe dunesbury or something so there
are a few Comics that people will say
it's the only reason I got the newspaper
and Dilbert has been one of the comics
that people have said for decades it's
the only reason I get the newspaper
now that's people who don't have an
internet connection I guess or don't
know how to use it
it's pronounced day deus ex machina
d-e-u-s is pronounced Deus
not deuce
does everybody agree with that
um oh yes okay the smart people the
smart people who know Latin are saying
it's Diaz DSX machina
I always thought it was deuce
all right well learn something today
um
Dilbert app yeah we had one for a while
that would be interesting
talk about Limp Biscuit is Limp Biscuit
in the news I saw a bunch of comments
what did Limp Biscuit do
uh yeah I know Deus means god
they broke stuff
Native American mound builders why do
you think I have an opinion on that
all right here's a question will Tucker
Carlson cover the story
what do you think
see that it's possible that this fight
hasn't started yet
so one of the things The Daily Beast
editor did which was a smart I have to
give him credit for this it was a messed
up thing to do but it's something I've
done before because it works
so the daily editor tweeted after the
story started breaking he goes cue the
cue the conservative media defending the
racist
which makes it look like you know he
predicted it but
it's not hard to predict when you know
the story is wrong
if you know the story is not real
you can accurately predict that
conservative media is going to tear the
 out of you
I don't know what Tucker is going to do
he might ignore it I don't know I'm not
sure if it's I don't know if it's on his
beat or not but if he takes a bite out
of it he's going to leave a mark he's
going to leave a mark
so I I don't know if you know the I
don't know if the show is like uh the
five or Gutfeld you know that they have
a lighter Vibe I don't know if they
would take this on but
um
I need a food taster
did did anybody see my uh comic for
today the Dilbert comic for today
if you didn't
I'm going to read it to you
because it's on point for what's
happening right at the moment by Twitter
user by user follower is just screaming
I'll tell you the the number of people
who agree with me are very quiet
but if you wanted if you wanted to know
in general is it more popular than
unpopular well I would look at my
Twitter numbers
to know that a lot of people are on the
same page I worry though that they have
the wrong impression of why they're
agreeing with me
if you know what I mean
did you introduce a black character in
Dilbert today no I did that a while ago
I got canceled the first time you did
that remember I got canceled for
introducing a black character
do you remember that I lost like a whole
chain of newspapers yeah
all right I was going to show you the uh
Dilbert comic for today
which I'm sure
I tweeted damn it I can never find my
own stuff
all right let's do this the other way
all right I'm going to read this to you
because
it's sort of on point at the moment
total coincidence
just got lucky on this one
you know I do the comic a month or so in
advance for the dailies and every now
and then one will hit that's just like
the perfect situation all right so it's
the gang sitting around the table
and I'll just show you this one picture
and then the rest of it
why the hell
oh my God such a bad interface
oh I God
okay oh my god oh this is the worst user
interface but I'm going to make this
work
all right I think you can see this this
is uh dog berries at the table with the
rest of the staff and he says uh this is
Bob right so Bob's character you haven't
seen before
and uh dogbert explains he says uh Bob
likes to debate but he isn't good at it
when you disagree with Bob he will
insist that the only reason you disagree
is that you're afraid if you get
vaccinated Bob will say you are afraid
of catching a sniffle
if you don't get vaccinated Bob will say
you're afraid of getting the shot
Bob believes your thinking process does
not extend beyond your fears that's
because Bob is a Who projects his
one-dimensional worldview on others then
Bob says sounds like you're afraid to
admit I'm a better debater than you are
and Dogma says there it is
there it is
so
for 34 years
every time somebody disagreed with me
somebody said
oh you're afraid
oh you're afraid
what do you think this week
does it feel to you as though I manage
my career based on my fear
um
[Laughter]
it would be hard to explain this week
no
in fact one of the things that's hardest
for me to explain to people is how I'm
not afraid of stuff
because it's sort of irrational I'm
irrational in the wrong direction I'm
often irrationally not not worried about
stuff I'm irrationally calm
I don't know the last time I was
irrationally afraid or something
I'm sure it's true I'm sure I have I
can't think of one
all right well very soon I might be the
first free man in America who can say
what he what he means at the risk of any
consequences
and I have to admit I'm kind of feeling
good about it you know I'll have to work
out how I survive survival survival will
still be a you know something I have to
navigate
I'm not entirely sure I can go out in
public this week
would you let me ask you would you go if
you were me would you go out in public
this week
anywhere that you could be recognized
now logically I shouldn't
but I'm not going to care
yeah logically I should not go in public
for a week or so
but
that's not going to stop me
I'm sure I'll do do whatever I want
um because remember nobody's ever had a
problem with me personally
so unless somebody snuck up behind me
and you know hit me before they talked
to me I don't really have a risk
you hope I'm armed at all times
well I'll always say that I'm a big
supporter of the Second Amendment
I like to leave some mystery there
but
if anyone anyone wants to around
and find out
they can
Katie Hobbs taking cartel money somebody
says is there any kind of evidence for
that that sounds like the sort of thing
for which there will be no evidence
but I'm open to it I mean maybe
fencing all this in the news with Katie
Hobbs I I saw a reference to it but I
don't believe it's I just assumed it was
fake news
are you telling me that there's actual
evidence of her connection to cartel
money
I doubt that
all right well I'll look into that
I shall look into that
all right that's all for now YouTube I'm
gonna go talk to the subscription people
over at locals and thanks for joining
uh looks like we got a big crowd here
today I appreciate all the comments as
well make sure you see the hotep Jesus
interview on YouTube
with me to explain anything that you're
still wondering about
