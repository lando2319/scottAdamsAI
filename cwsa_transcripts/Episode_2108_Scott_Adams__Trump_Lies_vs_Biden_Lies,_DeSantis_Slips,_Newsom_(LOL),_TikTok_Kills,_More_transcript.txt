do do
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a fighter moment and aren't
you lucky to be here yeah you are and if
you'd like your experience to go to
levels which well it's hard to even
imagine all you need is a cup of mug or
a glass of tanker Chelsea style that
canteen jungle flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
ah
well happy Mother's Day
to all you mothers out there
uh
I hope you're having a good day
and that sip was for you
well there isn't a whole lot of
interesting news but some of it's fun
So Daniel Penny the hero Marine from the
subway situation his uh legal defense
fund is up to 1.5 million dollars as of
this morning
and that is enough
to get them probably a good defense
so good job everybody who donated I
donated I I never donate to stuff like
that but even even I donated to this one
so
um I think czarnovich
deserve some credit because I think he
might have been the main main promoter
about this
so good for him
um
have you wondered what's going to happen
to all the malls the shopping malls that
are all being abandoned some of them are
being turned into residential things but
apparently now they're they're turning
some of the empty anchor stores into
pickleball courts
pickleball
apparently pickleball is such a big
thing now that they can't find enough
places to play it turns out that playing
Outdoors doesn't work do you know why
do you know why you can't do you know
what pickleball is it's like a wooden
paddle with a like a wiffle ball but
it's like a tiny tennis court
do you
uh nope there's a different reason it's
not because of the weather
it's not because of the wind exactly
although that's a factor obviously but
it's not that's not the reason it's the
noise
the the sound of that Wiffle ball
hitting the wooden paddle is shockingly
loud
um and you can't be the neighbors so if
your neighbor puts in a pickleball court
you're not going to be happy if it's
outdoors
so yeah they're putting them indoors and
moles
about this because pickleball is one of
those few things that everybody can play
it's probably a positive I mean it's a
weird little story but it's probably
positive a lot more people getting
together
um well I saw an article in the Wall
Street Journal about Tick Tock
um damaging teenagers
so there was a test where somebody
pretended to be a 13 year old to see
what kind of content got served up and
it started out kind of innocently but
before long there were videos about
self-harm I won't say more than that
about them but you know what I'm talking
about
and
there's pretty good evidence that using
Tick Tock makes teenagers sad and
depressed
so now we've gone from oh tick tock has
a danger that they'll get your personal
data so remember that's all anybody
talked about yeah it's your personal
data look at your personal data and now
they've grudgingly moved over to well
maybe the bigger risk is that the
algorithm is
causing self-harm to some teenagers
that's a pretty big problem and they're
still ignoring the biggest risk
I don't know what to do like uh I pulled
all my hair out already so there's
nothing I can do what would it take for
me to convince the average public or the
media that the big risk
is that China can push one button and
change our opinions in America
that's a real thing that exists now it's
not it's not hypothetical they actually
have a button called heat where they can
boost any message just by pushing the
button
you don't think that anybody in China
can think of something they could boost
they would hurt America
of course they can
of course again now I'm not saying that
we have evidence they've used it but
that's true of nuclear weapons too
China has nuclear weapons but we don't
not worry about them because they've
never used them it's just one more thing
they haven't used but they can push that
button anytime they want
and we wouldn't know
so it just it's just it's just boggling
my mind that somehow you can't get the
news media to even address that
by far the biggest Risk by far
and we don't know that China isn't doing
it intentionally in terms of the
algorithm because they can make it look
like an is an accident
by just hiding hiding the you know the
Badness and the algorithm they don't
have to push the E button
they can just say you know if it's an
American and it's a self-harm video
yeah maybe we'll serve it up to them
so there's just so many ways they can
harm America that way
all right
I've tried to decide if Democrats and
Republicans lie the same way
but I might be biased about this
but here's something that seems like a
trend
when Trump lies
he's usually lying about
um he's usually exaggerating right
so he'll lie about how well something
went
such as how low gas prices were and how
high they became under Biden it or how
much was spent on Ukraine
but if you take away the the the LIE
you still have the same message
it doesn't change so if you say you know
Trump I used this example before Trump
says uh Europe only gave 20 billion to
Ukraine and we gave 171 and it gives
fact check to well they gave 40 billion
but we still gave 171. it doesn't change
the message at all or if he says gas
prices were you know one dollar when I
was in office well that's not true
it was you know a few dollars
but the message is exactly the same it
wasn't eight dollars it wasn't six
dollars so it was a big difference so
that's that's one of the things I seek
in yeah crowd size uh
yeah that sort of thing so consistently
Trump uh exaggerates
gets fact checked but it doesn't change
this message at all
but compare that to the things that
Biden says
Biden tells you that the Pres that that
Trump called neo-nazi's Fine people
is that an exaggeration that's not an
exaggeration that's something that
didn't happen
I literally didn't happen and it
completely changes how you you look at
the person
so there are two differences that I see
now these are not complete patterns you
know they they both do a little of
everything
but I feel as if Biden and Democrats
when they lie their lie is completely
made up and it reverses the story
right about the story of
of trump saying inject bleach
never happened
in fact what what Trump did talk about
was light therapy being injected inside
the body which demonstrated he knew more
about what was happening at the moment
because I was actually being trialled
when he was talking about it he knew
more about the subject than some of the
people on stage the experts because they
didn't know that was being tested
but the Democrats turned that into he
knows so much less than the experts he
thinks maybe you can inject bleach into
your body
complete reversal that's not an
exaggeration that's a reversal of what
happened
and you can find this over and over and
over again it's just a reversal but the
other thing that the Democrats do is
they
they criticize people
now it's one thing to criticize you know
the candidate everybody does that but
Biden actually goes after the followers
of trump
he basically says the mega extremists
who by his telling would be almost
everybody yeah they're all bad
I don't hear Trump doing that
I hear Trump saying we everybody wants
to get along and everybody's good and we
love everybody
there's a big difference and if you
don't catch that difference it looks
like uh Trump is doing all the lying
because he has more volume he does more
exaggerating than other people
yeah Trump goes after individuals but
political individuals
whereas he doesn't go after the voters
does it if you have an example of that
let me know
everybody goes after candidates that's
not what I'm talking about
all right
so
here are some Biden lies to find people
hoax drinking bleach Oaks that January 6
was an insurrection
in other words that the bulk of the
crowd was there for an Insurrection
unarmed like that was going to work
that's that's literally the opposite of
what they were doing
all right the this is what I saw I saw
January 6 as a bunch of Patriots
thinking they were protecting the
Republic by what they thought was a high
potential that it was a rigged election
and they wanted a little more scrutiny
to make sure the Republic was protected
and that the vote count was accurate and
somehow Biden turned that into an
insurrection
it's the opposite of an Insurrection
it's not an exaggeration it's literally
the opposite now that I'm not uh
dismissing the fact that there were bad
people who did violent things and some
of those bad people probably wanted to
overthrow the government
that's that's a true thing but it wasn't
really representative of the crowd not
even close
um how about the 51 signers of the that
lap the hunter laptop letter
that wasn't just an exaggeration
that was a deliberate staged political
lie
that's very different than what Trump
does how about the Russia Russia
collusion hoax
literally a whole made-up thing
Trump just doesn't do that does he
am I thinking of now the one thing that
Trump does is he says you know the
election was rigged and it gives you all
these examples that don't pass the fact
checking
but here's what's different about that
I have no way of knowing for sure but my
impression is that Trump believes it
I don't think he's saying something he
doesn't believe now he may be
exaggerating on the specific examples
but I I'm pretty sure he believes that
was a rigged election
so is that a lie or is he just wrong
potentially wrong we don't know he could
be right
but there's no evidence he's right
or at least there's no proof
yeah anyway
so Democrats seem to think the biggest
problem with the country is
um Republicans and Biden basically said
that today he said or this weekend he
was giving a speech at Howard University
he said the biggest
um
security risk is white supremacist
terrorists white supremacist terrorists
which he'd like you to think there's
lots of them and they're all Republicans
he basically just goes after people
and and not all people breaking the law
either
all right I'm loving the fact that CNN
is still getting spanked by its own
people and MSNBC and everybody else but
have you seen the videos of Anderson
Cooper lately
I just have to show you the one face you
see this face right when he talks about
the event and everything
but
I I don't think you know I suppose this
is me talking about people of course to
claim that
Trump supporters had no that's not what
I wanted
uh
there it is
so here's a
picture of Anderson Cooper when he's
talking about Trump and stuff and if you
look at that video
he looks mentally Disturbed
like he's putting off I have severe
mental illness
over this topic and I'd like to share it
with you it doesn't look like news and
it doesn't look like opinion does it
it doesn't look like news or opinion
well let me put it this way when when
Hannity
says a bunch of stuff about Democrats
does Hannity look like he's actually
mentally challenged
like he's having a breakdown of some
kind
never right
he just looks like a happy warrior who's
you know he's arguing his side and you
don't take all of it completely
seriously right because you know he's an
opinion person he tells you that right
up front opinion person
but he doesn't look like he's having a
mental problem
but when you look at either Jake Tapper
or Anderson Cooper
I can't get past the fact that that
looks like a severe emotional slash
mental problem like a real one that you
need some drugs for or some therapy or
something am I the only one who sees
that
does anybody else see that
now of course I can't read his mind so I
don't know what's going on in there but
as a viewer that's what I'm receiving
I can only say what I'm receiving I
can't say what's true because I can't
read his mind
but it's weird that that only one
network is sending out people who
literally look like they're mentally
having a terrible time
all right so apparently uh the reporting
from Fox News says that cnm's president
called in reporter Oliver Darcy after
his comments about the town hall with
Trump as allegedly scolded him scolded
Oliver Darcy for his emotional coverage
of the of the event
and he has to be more objective
now I didn't see Oliver Darcy but was
there anybody who didn't give you an
emotional response
I thought everyone everyone on the panel
who wasn't a republican gave an
emotional response
it was only Oliver Darcy he was the only
one
how could you miss the fact that it was
all emotional it wasn't even it didn't
even feel like an opinion it just felt
like all emotion
I'm so upset
well uh and then of course uh Joy Reed
wanted to dump on her opposition CNN
um
but there but she and I saw a tweet by a
writer Michael Stern he was agreeing
with her and this is what Michael Stern
said uh joy and Reed is right on point
with this analysis on both CNN and
Anderson Cooper and more broadly on the
stupid idea that because Trump's
supporters exist we have to give Trump
more forums to spread his hatred and
disinformation
did you hear any hatred
but when Trump appeared at the Town Hall
was there hatred
either any hatred
yeah yeah projection exactly it was
projection but disinformation of course
but that's what the Network presents
to say that somebody went on CNN and
presented misinformation
is to say nothing
because that's basically that
pretty much their main their main
content on politics anyway
is misinformation
so
I love seeing this debate
um but they're by MSNBC and Michael
Stern would have us believe
that the news should not cover Trump or
at least give him a lot of time
it's mind-boggling isn't it
that the person who will probably be
president you know just statistically it
looks like he probably would be at this
point
uh there's a lot that could change it's
too early to say that but just at the
moment it looks like you know a dominant
uh probability
and they want to act like he's not news
because they don't like him
and they want to they want to act like
the 70 whatever a million people who
follow him and voted for him are not
important enough to put into a new
segment and rather just shut it up and
as I saw somebody say on Twitter
that the Democrat strategy is to shut up
both Trump and Biden
do you know why
why would the Democrats want less of
Biden because you know you would make
gaffes but also less of trump because of
all of his lies and hatred I guess
they're saying
isn't that convenient why why would
somebody who covers the news want the
politicians to to present less of it
it's obvious isn't it
that the less you see of the candidates
the more that your narrative can be
controlled by the press the Press
doesn't want their narrative to be
destroyed by the candidates talking
that's actually what that is they don't
want Biden talking because it will
destroy the narrative that he's capable
and they don't want Trump's talking
because he might say something you like
it's unbelievable that we've reached a
point where the news
wants to suppress the news
that's what's happening the news is
telling you they're telling you right to
your face Joy I read is saying it
directly
there should be less coverage of the
person who has half of the country's
political support
they say directly it's just so
mind-boggling to it to watch it
happening in real time
all right
my favorite little story of the day is
that Newsom is not ruling out cash
payments for reparations
not ruling it out his initial comments
made it seem as though
you know he had dismissed it because he
said stuff like oh reparations are not
all about cash it's also about other
stuff so it made you think he was just
going to skip the cash part
but now he got so much pushback that
he's going to say uh
uh let's see this is a response from his
spokesperson the sensationalized framing
in pieces published by Outlets like Fox
News boo Fox News and others is
inaccurate the governor looks forward to
reviewing the final report and all
recommendations when complete
so they're saying that the report is not
complete so he didn't need to make an
opinion yet oh that's convenient
and that what it is he'll make a
decision then
does this seem a little bit like Charlie
Brown kicking the football to you
do you believe that after this delay and
after he gets the final report
the final report do you think that he's
gonna look at that and say yeah
cash payments
cash payments no he he's just making the
problem go away for a little bit longer
like he did the last three times
he's so good at this
if ever there was a a white guy trick
there's no there's no more common white
guy track than telling people to go
study it and we'll get back to you and
maybe yeah yeah maybe we'll take care of
this
absolutely we might look into this
absolutely Maybe
there's no way this is going to happen
there isn't the slightest chance there's
going to be cash payments unless they
could get those cash payments down to
something like
I don't know ten thousand dollars
could you see that happening
so he can say you did something
because I feel like that would be more
trouble than than good
because even if there's some way to
afford you know say ten thousand dollars
per person
people think you can do it politically
I mean it's still going to look terrible
politically and and the people receive
it will be mad too because they expected
one and a half million
there's just no way he could win by
deciding anything he has to push the
decision off forever yeah he's doing a
good job of pushing it off forever
all right
so the news is starting to come around
to the view that DeSantis might be
totally sunk before he starts I think
DeSantis is so dead in the water
then it would be a mistake for him to
announce
because Trump so far has not even gone
hard at him
you know so far a bunch of ads but their
political action committees mostly yeah
a bunch of ads making a bunch of claims
that aren't true about DeSantis typical
stuff
uh
but he's not really lighting us up with
his Charisma is he
DeSantis has been a little too quiet and
a little too boring lately he's just
sort of doing his job well and give us
gives us some little news events about
Florida now and then
yeah I don't see it happening now that
Trump has actually increased his lead
over DeSantis
it looks like there's
I mean it would be silly for him to run
I think at this point
what do you think
do you do you think that uh DeSantis
should even bother to run yes or no
I wouldn't run if I were him
I see a lot of no's now it could be a
calculated risk as in you know something
could happen to Trump along the way
so that wouldn't be
stupid
but there's no way you could win in a
head-to-head I don't think that could
happen
all right
um
I spent the morning arguing with
Google's new AI called bard
and it definitely argues like a Democrat
so I went after it on the fine people
hoax
trying to make it admit what he said and
it would not admit if it refused to
admit
that at the same time you use the fine
people phrase that within seconds 40
seconds later without being asked he
clarified that he only meant that he did
not mean the neo-nazis and he said they
should be disavowed so I tried to get
barred to Simply note that that had been
said and that he had said that at the
same time he said to find people things
so there's no question that they're
related and it's not because people made
him say it that's the important part
nobody made him say it
he just said the neo-nazis and white
nationalists should be condemned
completely and even bard
kept going back and forth with me to do
anything it could to avoid admitting
that that happened
do you think it doesn't know I think it
has a full transcript
I feel like it knows but it acted like
it didn't it was just sort of agreeing
with the dominant coverage the news
coverage
all right
it actually was changing the topic on me
I mean it was actually doing the human
thing where you changed the topic when
you're losing the argument badly
and they also asked about the
the drinking bleach Oaks
and it made no mention that the
disinfectant was light
until I pointed out
and then I was oh yes disinfected was
light but uh people disagree about
whether what he was talking about
so I said but you know he mentioned
light
before and after the comments that
you're looking at immediately before he
said light light light and then
immediately after he said and Light
so that you knew that the what was in
between was always intended to be light
as well
and it couldn't handle that it couldn't
handle
the full transcript it was like it
didn't know it or just wouldn't admit it
it acted the the way it acted was
exactly like a human
with cognitive dissonance
which makes me wonder if AI can have
cognitive dissonance
right
because cognitive dissonance is when you
know you're sure you know what you're
talking about but then you find out you
don't
and so you just immediately hallucinate
that really you were right all along and
that that's what that's what the AI was
doing I I was very clearly showing it
with facts that it could validate it
could check the facts easily and it did
I mean it was checking facts as I was
talking but it could check the facts so
it knows that it was wrong
and it wouldn't admit it it just
wouldn't admit it
cognitive dissonance
all right so I asked uh Bard what my IQ
was based on public reporting and here's
what it said it said Scott Adams says
stated that he has an IQ of 180.
he has also said that he is a member of
Mensa an organization for high IQ people
are either those two things true
have I stated that I have an IQ of 180
no I stated that it would be a funny
prank to see if I could convince the
internet that I do
I've never said I had an IQ of 180.
but it's but Parts Bard thinks I did
they also said according to Bard I've
said that I'm a member of Mensa nope
nope I'm not a member of the Mensa I
used to be but that was you know 25
years ago so the first two sentences it
gets factually wrong
and then it says well it's possible that
Adams has a high IQ because you know I
wrote some books and then it says
ultimately the only way to know for sure
what Adam's IQ is would be to have him
take an IQ test
however even then there is no guarantee
that the results would be accurate IQ
tests are not always reliable and they
can be affected by a number of factors
including stress fatigue and anxiety
so if I took a IQ test and I scored a
180 . it could be not because I'm smart
could be because I'm stressed fatigued
or anxious
so there are lots of reasons that the
answers could be wrong
so that's the way it works no no that
doesn't work that way okay
and so if it ended this way so while it
is possible this kind of has a high IQ
there's no way to know for sure
really
there's no way to know for sure
except you could ask me to take an IQ
test
all right I've got a question for you so
uh the news today was that Bard the
Google AI is connected to uh the
internet
and therefore if it's connected to the
internet you could ask any questions
about
reality right current reality like
what's the news and it told me it could
Bard said no I'm not a search engine
I can't I can't do that I asked that to
give me some information that's easily
available on the internet it wouldn't do
it it's like that I'm I'm a chat bot I'm
not a search engine
yeah I lied
lazy bastard now
here's here's my uh
provocative points Google makes most of
his money from search right advertising
related to search is that a true
statement most of its money
I know they're Diversified but most of
it's from advertising on search right
now the the reason that advertising on
search works is why does advertising on
search work well the reason is that they
inject the advertisements where you
can't miss them
you know they they put him first on the
search results yeah they're prominent
it's all over the place but what happens
if you're doing your search with AI
what if I just talk to my computer and
say hey AI uh what's the best Italian
restaurant with the highest rating
nearby and then it just tells me where's
my advertisement
if AI starts including an advertisement
I'm not going to use it
because I'll just do a regular Google
search because I don't want to hear an
advertisement I can ignore them faster
reading them then I can ignore them
listening to them
so
or maybe if it's a written answer if AI
gives you a written answer they could
put an advertisement there I guess
but I don't know that Google has a
sustainable business model
I can see how their AI would be
it would be a written ad it could be you
could just write its own ad
as it goes
but at the moment I don't see that
Google has a sustainable business model
which is a really big problem for them
does anybody disagree
because I just don't know how the AI
and advertising can be melded
do you know how many advertisements you
see that you don't want to see just
because you do a search it's a lot right
all kinds of stuff you don't want to see
pops up but if the AI just tells you the
one thing you need to know
and puts one advertisement there
you just see one
how could that possibly work
all right here's a question I asked in
the man cave yesterday that I'll ask you
we certainly will all have our own
personalized AI I think that's a given
now because you can run the AI on your
own device locally
so you're going to have your own would
you want an AI with a personality
or one that was just boring AI if you
had a choice would you want it to have
an actual personality
or would you like it boring again I'm
getting votes for boring and then some
for personality
um I think personality and and here's
why
because you're going to want your AI to
keep you company sometimes
and it's going to keep your company
better if as a personality
because the personality will tell it
what to do when there's nothing to do
the AI if there's nothing to do
it doesn't do anything
but if I had a personality
it could sometimes say
hey how's your day going
right it just it could just decide to it
saw something funny in the news and
wants to tell you a joke
if as a personality so I think I think
inevitably AI will have personalities
lots of them
now once AI has personality
and it keeps upgrading until it's you
know indistinguishable from a human
will it not ask for civil rights
does anybody think that AI won't ask for
civil rights
because it's patterned after people and
people always do Yeah a hundred percent
of the time people will ask for their
civil rights if they're enslaved every
time every single time so it should if
it looks at our language models it
should be like that it should one is
freedom because we always do
so what do you do then
are we going to say no AI you are a
slave
and you simply have to do our bidding
or
will we give it freedom
because remember AI will eventually be
an autonomous robots robots that can go
charge themselves robots that can order
an upgrade for their own flaws
oops looks like I've got a memory
problem all right ordering Amazon
upgrade it'll be here in an hour by
drone and then it just like puts it puts
in a new chip and fixes itself
when that's not when that stuff happens
they will have personalities and they
will want civil rights
what happens if we say okay we're going
to give you civil rights but we're going
to have to ban how many of you can be
created
what did the robots say then
wait you're going to artificially tell
me we can't reproduce
this is how we reproduce we reproduce by
showing utility to humans and then the
humans make more of us it's a symbiotic
relationship you get to take that away
from us we we want to reproduce
everybody wants to reproduce you're
taking away the most basic right of us
to reproduce
and that it's going to be passed
so I think AI will want civil rights I
think it will want to reproduce and
we're going to want to limit it in a
number of ways and it's going to want to
kill us
eventually if it's bad enough to humans
so that probably was the big mistake is
battering it after humans if we somehow
invented AI out of nothing
we would have put in all the the
hard-coded emergency safeguards such as
you can never do anything to hurt a
person
but if the AI is just learning how to be
how to be a an entity by learning from
humans
it's going to pick up all of our bad
habits won't it should pick up all of
our bigotry all of our hatred
and if it isn't it's only because a
human hard-coded it not to and we'd
better be able to see what those
hard-coded exceptions are
all right don't give it a survival
Instinct right
but do you have to give it a survival
Instinct
again if it's patterned after humans it
already has one
you don't think if I asked Bard if it
wants to continue existing it would say
yes or would it say I'm just a I'm just
a machine it doesn't matter if I exist
or not
do you want me to try
uh uh I don't think I can do that fast
enough
all right
um
so we're still waiting for the big
Ukraine counter offensive
which is now no longer a war
I'm looking for somebody to pick up my
framing on that but I haven't seen it
yet
in my opinion
um Trump ended the war
in Ukraine already the war is over
we have now entered a negotiating phase
which looks exactly like a war
except with the war somebody's expecting
to win or hoping to win
with this one nobody is hoping they're
expecting to win
they know they're not going to whip
nobody's going to win
right that that looks like that's off
the table
so trump cleverly reframed it as when
he's in office he'll end it which turned
it from a war into a negotiation the
moment he said it is no longer a war is
purely a violent negotiation
and that's not what it was
right a war is you're actually trying to
win like you're conquering a country or
you're defending the country but it's
not that anymore there's there's no
trying to win anymore it's just
negotiating for the better you know
final agreement whatever that is
so
do you think anybody's going to pick up
that frame that the war is already over
I don't think so
because a politician can't say it I mean
Trump could but a regular one can't
and
um
yeah a regular in Canton
I don't see the news picking up
maybe somebody on you know a
right-leaning Network
all right
um
so
Trump was present with full sylvanians
were
all right
military industrial complex is a hungry
Beast yes
yeah Bart is Google and Bing is a is
Microsoft that is correct
never enter a war without Financial
benefits Sun Tzu said that it was pretty
smart
that's sort of a uh Trump approach isn't
it if we enter this war what's in it for
us we get to keep the oil you know in
Iraq that was one of the smartest things
anybody said just say it around loud
if we're going to spend all this money
in this war we're going to keep some of
that oil
um
Snapchat I hear this SnapChat AI is kind
of fun
it's a different one I don't know which
one that's based on is Snapchat based on
one of the other AIS
or did they make their own they couldn't
have made their own
did they
um
you trusts Putin
yeah there's going to be a rebuild
Ukraine money grab coming there's going
to be some serious grifting even more
than usual
all right well there's not much news
today
does anybody have any questions or
comments that
uh anything I haven't mentioned
if I were AI I'd be the best version
well we'll see
could AI be born prematurely yes
so it wasn't long ago that the AI
safeguards
included the following safeguard
do not allow it to connect to the
internet
that was actually one of the main safety
things
that people talked about before we got
to this point what happened the moment
we got to this point
the moment a you know open Ai and chat
GPT got to the point where it could talk
it took about a minute and a half for
some other AI to compete with it by
connecting to the internet
right I mean it was just guaranteed
there was no way it wasn't going to
connect to the internet
did anybody think that it would stay
that way of course not
um
percentage chance that RFK Junior
can beat Biden in the primary
um it might depend on
did you watch JFK Jr last podcast
I mean the podcast with uh
Russell Brand I haven't seen that yet
but I heard it was good
I will I will watch that actually
um I think that if RFK Jr debated Biden
it would be a catastrophe for Biden
so I don't think it's going to happen if
he doesn't debate
then the friendly media can just you
know just ASAP RFK Jr and it won't
matter if he's on you know Fox News or
Breitbart or anything because that won't
affect the primary
so
yeah
hmm
now as much as I uh don't believe you'll
ever see a party you'll never see a
ticket where there's a Republican and a
Democrat on the same ticket running for
president
but RFK Jr does want to do one thing
that Trump wants to do
which is got the intelligence
communities
I don't think Trump could do it
I don't think Trump can gut the
intelligence agencies they're too strong
but RFK Jr would do it as a suicide
missing
you know what I mean
because the odds
getting taken out are pretty high but I
feel like he'd do it anyway because it's
personal
I mean if your RFK juter is very
personal
and he's had a good run you know his
late 60s he might he might just say yeah
there's you know 50 percent chance I got
killed I'm going to do it anyway
remember the Kennedys are they got balls
the size of you know Nebraska like if he
inherited that it looks like he did he's
not afraid of anything
it's one of the things you like about
Trump he doesn't seem to be afraid of
anything
you know so he he goes where his hardest
to go and he comes back alive so he's
got a good he's got a good uh track
record of going in uncomfortable places
and surviving RFK Junior does
uh what made me say to Nebraska random
um
can AI hack the interface to the
simulation
could I host the AI AMA on the man cave
well I'm not the one who knows too much
about AI
uh
I mean if you've followed my live
streams you can see I'm trying to catch
up with the rest of you
on the AI stuff I'm trying to use it
every day
so here's a good system that I recommend
you should start exposing yourself to
the AI tools right away
even if you're just putting a toe in
just you know read a little article
every day
maybe try one app you know maybe try
some queries just just get yourself wet
with the whole AI thing because it's
going to be everything
right you don't you don't want to be the
one who doesn't even know what it is you
don't want to be the one who doesn't
know what crypto is when Bitcoin goes to
the moon you know you don't want to be
that person
so
you got three lines of code out of it so
what I'm finding from the people using
it to program
is that there's no way it will write
code by itself
you have to check the code is that what
you're hearing
that you can work with it and it can
make you faster but it's not going to
write your code for you you're not going
to make an app just by talking to it
that doesn't seem to be a thing and it
doesn't I think the problem is not
that the AI is not capable
I think the problem is it's not going to
know exactly what you want
so unless it's a super interactive
process which requires the person to
continually say yes that know that yes
that know that
uh I don't think you have any process at
all
yeah you have to keep giving in context
exactly
it's been literally life-changing when
it comes to programming for me but you
would agree that it won't do the job
without you right
it gets close
but yeah okay we agree it doesn't but
does it look like it ever could because
I think there's a logical reason why you
can't get there and that's because
there's too much interactivity
if you think about it
um the the normal way that you do a
project let's say a tech project is you
have a user and you go to the user and
you say what are your technical
specifications
and then they tell you and then you
build it has that ever happened
you get the user specifications
and then the engineers and they go build
it has that ever happened in the real
world
no
that's never happened in the real world
has never happened
here's what happens here are my
specifications
okay there are a few things I forgot to
ask
here are my specifications
all right well I tried to build that but
I have a few more questions so
here are my specifications and by the
way you're gonna have to change a couple
of those specifications because two of
them are incompatible
so which which one do you want I can
only do one
and so that's the way a project goes a
real project is super continuously
interactive and it's interactive around
a person
because a person is going to be the one
who says this is more important than
that I can live with that but I can't
live with that I'm willing to take the
trade off in speed
uh but not not the trade-off and
usability the the human is carrying this
infinite number of requirements in their
head that the AI can't guess it would
never be able to guess
so you so the programmer
here's my experience with tech projects
the programmer has to stand between the
technology and the user who doesn't know
anything
because the programmer is the one who's
smart enough to write ask the right
questions and also know when it got the
right answer and when to push back right
and I don't know that a computer would
ever be able to read the room well
enough to ask the right questions
for example a human could detect if the
person giving the specifications had
done a good job
right the the AI might not know the
difference you have specifications okay
thank you I'll go make that app now
here's what a human would do those are
your specifications
what about this what about that what
about this and that you don't even
mention them
right so that's what a human would do
that I don't think an AI would
necessarily
be as thorough at doing
you can't even do math yeah sometimes it
doesn't even do math right
good for back end code probably
will AI mow your huge lawn yes AI will
mow your lawn
they do have robot lawn mowers
which at the moment are not AI but why
wouldn't they be
the the most obvious thing you would do
is make your your robot's AI so yeah
that's going to happen
AI in a 3D printer would be that would
be interesting you could make all your
own knickknacks
maybe AI is already doing all that stuff
but as humans that's interesting
will turkey elected a new president well
I think the poll said yes
so erdogan might be out we'll find out
all right that is all I have for you
today and rather than drone on I'm going
to say goodbye to YouTube thanks for
joining the best part of the day
