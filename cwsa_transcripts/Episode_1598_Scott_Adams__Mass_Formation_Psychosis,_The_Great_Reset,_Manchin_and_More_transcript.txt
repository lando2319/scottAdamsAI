oh goodness
what a day
can you believe it you showed up on time
for those of you who are alive and
amazingly those of you watching this on
a recorded
basis
uh you're on time too it's weird uh yeah
something about space time i don't
understand it either
but
all i know is this is the best thing
that's ever happened to you it's called
coffee with scott adams
because of the scott adams part plus the
coffee and we're going to enjoy that
right now
would you like to take it up a level
anybody anybody
take it up a level yes no
i feel the yeses
i feel the yeses and so all you need is
a copper mugler glass a tanker jealous
inside a canteen jerk flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
to the day thing makes everything better
it's called the 17th sip and this
happens now go
ah
yeah some of you weren't ready were you
see
you've got to be ready
let this be a cautionary tale
those of you who are thinking
i've got plenty of time to pour my
warm cup of coffee no you don't always
have time you've got to be ready
well we've got a great show today let's
start off with joe manchin killing the
build back better bill
so biden's build back better bill
got
blown to parts to bits
that's right
biden's
and actually it's just shelved because
joe mansion was a big no
um
now
here's the thing
how do you view this
like what what is the way you interpret
the situation well
michael schellenberger had a interesting
take on it which i agree with totally
that it was progressive dogmatism that
killed it
progressive dogmatism
progressive dogmatism would be the
opposite of
what would that be the opposite of
science
economics
rational
pragmatism
right and i think that is that is
accurate
and specifically
it's accurate because
a lot of it was clean energy related and
it was just the wrong analysis
if if the buildback better build had
included let's say
expansions of nuclear and natural gas
do you think that maybe they could have
gotten a republican vote
maybe not because it would still be
inflationary
but
they'd be a lot closer
because at least they'd be compatible
with science
you know if you're not even compatible
with science and you're the pal you're
the party of science
now remember when i say hey be
compatible with science you're the first
thought you're thinking to yourself is
scott scott's got
they think they are
they think they're compatible with
science no they don't no they don't
because even the democrats now
understand
that the only reason we are where we are
is because we still have some nuclear
we'd better get some more soon and that
natural gas made a big difference in our
on our co2
so anybody who actually looked at the
data and looked at the science
would not have put together a bill that
looked this way
there would have been much more focus on
the
the things that are scientifically and
economically demonstrated nuclear being
chief among them
and so
here's the story i see i see that joe
manchin
uh took his party seriously
that was the problem
joe manchin took his party seriously
it's the party of science right
and so he said well let's look at the
science
the party of not being you know all
crazy like the republicans you know with
all their
conspiracy theories and whatever the
republicans are blamed of today
they're the party of being rational and
empathetic
you want empathy and science that would
be the things that the
republi the democrats would tell you
that they're all about
and so
joe manchin apparently take calling
their bluff
said all right let's say those are our
highest priorities science and empathy
using science
to be the best we can for
citizens what would that look like
and it doesn't look like the build back
better bill
and by the way how do
yeah how do we
how do we uh
avoid
noticing that his last name is mansion
i mean somehow that's important i don't
know
in our simulated world somehow that
should be a a signal that
that he's a character in a play
anyway
goldman sachs
lowered its growth gdp
estimates and the stock markets taken
ahead i think last i knew
because
the market is interpreting this is bad
so in goldman sachs take they said well
you know there won't be all this money
going into the economy
and then when they talked about
inflation
this is the only context they talked
about inflation
that because of inflation
it would be harder for this build back
better bill to ever get assigned in the
future
what's left out
there's something sort of big left out
right
the effect of inflation on the economy
this is goldman sachs
did they forget inflation
no they didn't forget it they talked
about it
in the wrong context
the only context they talked about it
was in a political context whether it be
harder to pass a bill
i think
you're supposed to include what that
would do to the actual economy
if
your goal is to talk about the economy
so here's goldman sachs
so obviously signaling that they're
making a political decision and not
not any kind of economic decision
because an economic decision would look
like this
there would be a lot of stimulus added
to the system that's on the positive
side
but on the negative side there would be
extra inflation added to the system and
we've looked at these two factors and
we've decided that one of them is bigger
than the other and therefore we're in
favor of it or against it
that's what that's what an honest
analysis would look like
did they do that
no they said there won't be as much
growth true
and that the inflation will affect the
politics
true
but you just left out the biggest factor
the inflationary effect on the actual
economy like like it didn't matter
so if you ever thought that goldman
sachs was an honest player that should
talk you out of it
so congratulations for joe manchin for
calling the democrats bluff and actually
being consistent with science and by the
way
did it matter that uh joe manchin got a
education from michael schellenberger
in person
about you know the economics of climate
change
yeah it mattered
i don't know if that changed the
decision but yeah that matters
when you have
i'm arguing the strongest persuader in
the country right now that would be
schallenberger the strongest persuader
in the country
talked to this person and he stopped the
whole deal by himself
stopped the whole deal i mean not by
himself he needed all the republicans to
be against it too
all right
uh the first case of omicron
variant in the united states that can't
be true somebody's saying that in the
comments
uh we must have known it was here
all right uh
i'm gonna give a little kudos to joe
biden
now those of you who are
not long time listeners
i remind you of my technique
if you want to criticize someone you
should also protect yourself from
confirmation bias and cognitive
dissonance
by saying as many good things as you can
about the subject of your criticism
because if you can't say anything good
about them
well i'm not going to take you seriously
so here i'm going to say something good
genuinely about joe biden
uh he did something that is was really
clever
and i called it out when he did it
in other words i said oh this is going
to work out this is clever and it worked
here's what it was
there was a big call for packing the
supreme court
joe biden to his credit
did not favor that but a lot of a lot of
his party did
so what you gonna do
you you don't favor it and you have a
pretty strong opinion about it but your
party does and you've gotta you've gotta
make them happy
what do you do
you put together a big old commission
and you have them study it
because that's how you kill something
because he knew of course he knew that
the commission would come back and not
recommend packing the court
don't you think he'd do that of course
he did that because all you know
there
nobody's gonna recommend it if they're a
serious academic
and
and so that's exactly what happened now
they didn't recommend for or against
they simply laid out the the argument
but he got the same result he basically
sent it to a committee to kill it
i told you that on day one that's how
you kill something you send it to the
committee to take all the energy out of
it because a lot of these things are
about the people right it's about trump
it's about biden
it's about the personalities and
kavanaugh and stuff but as soon as you
take the personalities out of it and
give it to a committee all the energy
just drains out of it and then once all
the energy is gone it's just a bunch of
academics saying you know this would be
a bad precedent
because every single person who gets
elected would just repack the court and
therefore we wouldn't have we wouldn't
have a system anymore it would literally
eliminate the system because you
wouldn't have the checks and balances
so
good move
that this is a plus management
i don't know if i've seen a cleaner kill
than what biden did with this court
packing idea that was a clean kill
and you could see him set it up from day
one
it was obviously a plan obviously i mean
i'm not a mind reader but you don't have
to go too far into people's thinking to
know this was an intentional play it's
such a standard play corporations do it
all the time
so a plus
good job
um how many of you have listened to the
no agenda episode a very
uh popular podcast with adam curry and
john dvorak
and on episode
1409 i guess it's a new one they take me
on how many of you have heard that
they're they're criticisms of my
opinions
now the the take on this is that they
destroyed me
if you look at the comments
um
so let me give you some context and then
i'll tell you why this is fascinating
now it's not just fascinating because
it's about me it makes a little more
interesting for me i guess
but here's what you need to know number
one
uh i like these guys
curry and dvorak i've known dvorak for i
don't know a thousand years or something
and i like them a lot
generally
we're very close to the same opinion on
all kinds of stuff
not everything but generally so i would
say that they would be closer to my
i don't know view of life that a lot of
people
and that's a compliment
of course anybody who agrees with you
you think is smart right
so
this is important for the context
remember these are not automatic binary
people who are just against whatever i
say right these are people who are
inclined
to agree with me
because they've agreed with me enough in
the past that they would not be biased
against me
now they took on my uh opinions on
ivermectin
vaccinations
and about
the mass formation psychosis
but i want you to listen to it i'll play
just uh one little part of it and i want
you to listen to it so you can learn to
spot cognitive dissonance
now the first question is
is it me
because that's part of their claim is
that the cognitive dissonance or the
hypnosis is affecting me
and that's why my opinions don't make
sense to them
so
how would you know
who is in cognitive dissonance and not
i'm going to teach you this over and
over again because you have to see
examples of it before you're good at it
the first thing you do is look for the
tells
all right here's one tell
the over laugh
mocking
right
an honest mocking would be somebody just
you know laughing and you say oh that's
this person is really amused it's pretty
funny but the over laugh
is this kind
he says x
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
sort of like a larry david almost comic
laugh
so you'll see that tell in some of it
and again
it
i'm sure they have genuine laughs
but but it doesn't even sound genuine
when you hear it it sounds like trying
too hard
does that make sense
so listen for the trying too hard to
laugh thing
here's another tell
mocking my credentials
specifically the credentials as a
hypnotist
without actually having a specific
complaint about it
oh he's a hypnotist ho ho
well
i guess he keeps mentioning that
all right but what does that have to do
with the argument it's actually useful
context
because a lot of people are new to any
live stream right you have to give the
context
so what's wrong with that so look for uh
like oversized criticisms of things
which are completely ordinary
which is somebody telling you their
credentials before they tell you what
they tell you
all right
then here's the biggest one look for
them to uh you could say straw man but i
don't think that's what's going on i
think they're actually hallucinating my
opinions
so
uh and i want to play one for you so
that you can you can hear it yourself if
you don't hear it live you might think
i'm misinterpreting this
so i don't know how far i am into this
it's 30 minutes into
no agenda podcast number 1409
so if you're looking for it yourself and
it's definitely worth listening to it's
it's interesting stuff so it's the no
agenda podcast you can find it
everywhere just google it and it's show
one four zero nine and it's at about the
30 minute mark
and i'm going to play a little bit here
is the kind of guy you want to spar
against so they're talking about me
smart
and i'm disappointed
no you hear what they're doing so
they're starting by saying that they
they're generally in favor of me which
is exactly what i did with them which is
also why i like them
because that's exactly what they should
be doing to set up the conversation
because they need you to know
they're not biased against me in some
general way it's just this technique so
that's actually good technique really
with what he did but not surprised
because i think i can prove that he in
fact himself is trapped in the mass
formation
he's going to prove that i'm trapped in
the mass formation in other words that
i'm hypnotized
uh have you ever heard of projection
i used to think it wasn't a thing and
now i've seen so many cases of it that
is undeniable at this point
so
that doesn't mean they're wrong right so
so far you just know that they're
accusing me of being hypnotized
essentially and i would accuse them of
the same uh which i'm doing right now
so so far it's a tie you wouldn't be
able to tell anything one way or the
other from this
sorry
it could be
i think i think i can show it you'll
show it
and i also believe that you and i have
heard the professor's explanation of
mass formation as it pertains to covid
well enough so that we comprehend it and
can reiterate it and explain it and
measure scott adams uh debunking versus
how we believe it works
um
now this all came out of
the
uh i guess he watched dr peter
mccullough
on the rogan show and that's where
mccullough brought up the mass formation
now scott adams as you pointed out he is
uh he's a trained hypnotist in fact
uh we should probably say right off the
bat we have proof that he is a very well
trained hypnotist
i mean if you've seen his wife you know
this guy definitely is a hypnotist
i'm not saying they don't make good
points
they do make good points
[Music]
unfortunately he didn't really do the
research
about the theory or refresh his memory
which is a big
uh
incorrect
i read about the theory before i
commented go
mistake and he starts off with uh
one of my favorite things that that we
talk about here just in general about dr
peter mccullough i think he's not good
at evaluating data so when he says that
some countries have good experience with
ivermectin that's just false
okay john you want to weigh in on that
do you want to weigh in on that or
should we listen all right so you heard
my claim right
so the claim they played was me saying
that there's no country we've identified
that ivormectin has solved the problem
right now some of you disagree but later
i'll say if you research it you'll find
that there are no countries that fit
that now remember the claim
the claim is there are no countries
right now watch the response to my claim
that there are no countries
that seem to have a good result no
much of a countries i mean there are
uh again i've had this website that i
keep referring to which has changed this
basic url i used to be ibm
meta.com but now it's i v9 something or
other i
but there's about
70 studies showing its effectiveness
that have been
peer reviewed and then the fda itself on
their one webpage where they say oh you
shouldn't use ivermectin because it's
unproven
[Music]
did he hear it
so what did i say
and then what did he say he called it a
whopper meaning that what i was saying
was clearly wrong or a lie
and then what was his response
it was a different topic
i said there are no countries that have
demonstrated it's working
he changed it to there no study that
there are studies that are peer-reviewed
did you hear me say
in the clip he played that there are no
peer-reviewed ivorbectin studies
i've never said that i've said the
opposite
i've said there are lots of
ivermectin studies that show it works
but they all have you know certain
limitations of size or
no control or it was an observational
stuff like that now you can see this
clearly right
because you're my judges
you're the ones who are judging who's in
cognitive dissonance did you clearly see
that he changed the subject
to debunk me while actually just being
on the wrong topic
did he ever debunk
the claim that there are countries
that that there are no countries or
towns or anything that have solved their
problem with ivermectin now if anybody's
new to me i'm not telling you ivermectin
doesn't work
i'm not telling you that
because i've actually said that you know
if i got in this situation i'd probably
take it
risk management
i think we're going to find out it
probably doesn't work but that's just
statistical you know prediction
if i had to about my life on it
i'd say there's a solid 10 chance it
could make a difference i'd take it
if my doctor agreed etc
so they've hallucinated an entire
opinion
that i don't hold
the that there's somehow no studies that
show its works of course i've talked
about it at length
all right so that's that's the first
tell uh let me give you a vote so far
who's who's in cognitive dissonance
so far
is it me or is it them
yeah it looks like them right
i mean i'm not the one who can tell
that's why i need a third party but of
course you're biased for me so that's
also a problem let's see what else they
say
so john says where there's smoke there's
fire meaning that there's so many
indications that it works
how could it all be wrong
that's not really a sophisticated
analysis of anything is there because
you know what else has lots of
smoke
everything that's not true
everything that you thought was true for
a while maybe
from
russia collusion to you name it they all
have plenty of smoke
but they're not true
yeah how much smoke is there that
hillary clinton has massively been
executing people
lots
i don't think it's true personally
i mean i could be surprised but i don't
think it's true
there are plenty of things
that have tons of smoke that aren't true
do you know why we do randomized control
trials
i don't think john devorak does
now that's not fair i don't know what he
thinks in his head but
the argument for a randomized controlled
trial is that you never want to say this
you never want to say there's so much
smoke there must be fire that's what
you're trying to avoid
with science
science is trying to cure this problem
of people saying they can see it with
their own eyes i'm looking right at it
look at all this evidence
that's the problem
that science cures
right
so he's in the problem instead of what
science cures while claiming
a scientific
i don't know insight
let's go out and then of course there's
the uh
the use and this discontinued use and
then reuse and
watching the numbers go up and down so
so
that is a bad thing to say yeah well
let's see let's listen how he arrives
and by the way and peter mccullough who
used to
was the editor of a couple of journals
where all you did was look at data it
just kind of belies it kind of overlooks
that fact he was a uh
a peer reviewer himself as it were i
think he's
all right so dvorak is saying that i'm
overlooking the fact that dr mccullough
is very experienced in peer review of
looking at studies
did i overlook that
do you think i overlooked that
no i'm saying that if you took somebody
who was a data analysis expert and you
sat them next to dr mccullough with all
of his uh all of his experience
looking at peer-reviewed or being a
peer-reviewed person
i would say it wouldn't be close those
are different expertise
that would be like me saying well i've
been paying attention to medicine for a
long time read a lot of articles so i'm
as good as a doctor
i mean i've been reading up on it i have
experience with my own medical problems
and stuff
so i'm basically a doctor aren't i
no
no if you don't study data analysis you
don't get there just by looking at
studies
you know
you're gonna have to go a lot deeper
than that
not good at evaluating data
all right so so that's the exaggerated
laugh did he hear it
so i said that the
the doctor was talking about was you
know highly skilled in his areas of
expertise
but they do not include looking at data
and i i'll give the exact example that
he's not aware that there's no country
that's had good success
and probably not aware of you know maybe
some other stuff all right so but let me
play the laugh again because you have to
hear the laugh
that was almost as if we scripted it
john i love that
so when he says that some countries
see if i could play that why would you
do that
we got everything on a roll
we know what to do we know exactly what
actually we should talk about
all right well
i think i could go on too long with that
so the point is they make some claims
about uh that i think that ivermectin is
nonsense
nope
nope
that does not capture my claim
and they said that i'm quote all in on
vaccinations
those of you who have been watching me
since the beginning
would you say that that is a good
characterization of my opinion that i
have been quote all in on vaccinations
no
it's not even close
it's not even in the ballpark
i'm literally the only person i know
who predicted the vaccinations wouldn't
work
can do you know anybody else i mean some
experts said it before i said it and
that's actually what informed me
the the reasoning that i use was the
expert said uh
we've been working on a corona virus
vaccination for
decades
we're not even close
there's nothing that's changed except
the pandemic why in the world would we
suddenly know how to make this thing
that we haven't known how to make for 20
years and we've been trying hard and i
listened to that i said yeah
that's a pretty good point
what are the odds that by coincidence
the pandemic would hit it exactly the
time we knew how to make a vaccination
we never knew how to make
i mean it's possible
i i was i wanted to feel optimistic
about it but i also predicted it
wouldn't work
and then it didn't as a vaccination
now i do say that the vaccinations work
in the sense that reducing the chance of
of
major illness
that's the official word i mean i didn't
do any studies myself but the official
word is it reduces your risk
so
if you see the maniacal laugh and all
that uh i don't know what happened to uh
curry and dvorak but it looks like
cognitive dissonance because i think
they're watching their ivermectin
opinion uh
go to hell they probably thought
binary about me that i was either for
vaccinations or against them
both of those are bad opinions in my
opinion
scott has gradually lost my respect on
these issues
i think his investments may be part of
his blind spot
investments
what investments do i have i had an
investment a little while in regeneron
but i sold it
so i don't have an and i just held it
for like a few months
um i don't think i i don't know of any
investments i have that would have any
bearing on this
um but when you say that i've uh
um
actually let me let me respond to this
directly
i'm always open to you saying what you
disagree with me
but i've lost my respect
 you
 you
just you and everybody who talks
like that really
uh i don't want to hear about you losing
your respect for me because i didn't ask
for your respect
i asked for you to maybe engage in the
argument
so you i don't have any respect for
you either zero
zero
all right
um i mentioned that uh the publication
revolver had a
investigative story about
the possibility that january 6 had some
fbi operatives
pushing what happened
now
i claimed that
it looked like a credible
reporting
but somebody sent me a chart that showed
the various
media entities
on a graph so that you could see
um if they were credible or not it had
revolver like way down in the not
credible
area with infowars according to whoever
put that chart together and i think to
myself
who in the world could put together a
chart of media bias
who could do that
how in the world would you not have cnn
and new york times as the least credible
entities
who gets to say was credible
it's like if any of us knew what was
true we wouldn't need the news
we're all confused
all right
so but here's my question i haven't seen
anybody debunk yet now keep in mind that
revolver did not
state
the fbi was behind it they don't have
that position
they just said uh here's the guy who
looks like the fbi here's a guy who's
not indicted that looks suspicious
here's another one who's not indicted
who looks suspicious
if you put him all together
it does tell a pretty powerful story if
the story is complete enough you know
right if they didn't leave out any
context
and if what they reported was true
and they show their sources
so you don't have to wonder where they
got it from they show you
so
has anybody seen a debunk of the
revolver reporting
because i haven't yet it could be i'm
open to it
um
somebody says the january 6 looks like
the charlotteville
thing well you know
um
the charlottesville march
uh they're they're i've got a lot of
questions
i don't think it was organic
um
clearly there were you know racists who
organized it i mean that's all
clearly in the record
but who runs the racists
do you think that the racists who
organized
that
are completely devoid of any outside
influence
they're not
they're not
so
to the to the extent that we don't know
who was backing the racists
we don't know even what happened
nothing
so and there's no curiosity about it
i mean i can tell you what i know
but i'm not going to uh let me just tell
you that there's a little bit of a
deeper mystery on
you know what powers were behind that
then that has come to light
but maybe maybe someday we'll know
uh elon musk says he'll be paying more
than uh 11 billion dollars in taxes this
year in response to all the
people like elizabeth warren saying he's
not doing enough
and i'm wondering
is that the most that anybody has ever
paid in taxes
certainly in one ear right
did he just did he just break the world
record in tax paying
how would you like to be so rich
that you can solve every problem
if you think about it
how many of you could have solved this
problem of you know your
somebody says you don't pay enough taxes
and elon musk can say well how about i
throw 11 billion dollars at it will that
make you stop talking
and you think to yourself
well
well it would make make me stop talking
the same way
so it's like all right
if you're complaining about my taxes how
about 11 billion dollars
will i shut you up
apparently not it didn't work that's the
funny part and people will still say he
doesn't pay enough taxes
[Laughter]
to me the funniest part will be that
this won't work but it's a hell of a
try um and i just love the fact
that we we always forget that tesla
doesn't do marketing
i don't think spacex does
and that that musk is their marketing
so when he does something like this
do you know what really happened do you
know what the real story is
what's the real story of why he sold
stock
anybody
what's the real reason he sold his stock
public relations
publicity somebody says
stock options
to make a profit no
i had to exercise options
was that it
we i i thought there was some voluntary
part of that
thank you diversification
yeah if if you make if you're the
richest person in the world but your
wealth is entirely in a few different
entities
you need to get some of that out of
there
you need to get some of your money out
of the things that have a specific risk
because it could be that tomorrow
somebody builds a you know fusion engine
and puts it in a prius and next thing
you know nobody's buying the tesla so
any company has the odds of going to
zero
no matter how
big or successful the company is it
still has a chance of going to zero
so
the smart thing to do is to find an
excuse
to take money off the table and put it
somewhere else where nothing can happen
to you you're invulnerable
so elon musk does a totally normal
economic move which is to take some
money off the table and diversify
but he turns it into this public
spectacle of paying more taxes than any
human
and
and
you know dunking on elizabeth warren and
bernie sanders
anytime you think that anything is done
for one reason
sometimes but it's very simple people
who do that
when elon musk does something there are
probably five reasons
right and we can think of three of them
and two of them he thinks of and you
haven't even thought of so yeah they're
like five reasons to do this one of them
was that you know he's responding to the
criticism
the others are even better but it was a
perfect exit point because he can make
it look like he's not cashing out
he made cashing out look like he was
paying taxes
could you do that
would you be smart enough to figure out
how to make
taking your money off the table and
keeping it forever
cashing out
could you make cashing out look like you
you're paying taxes
no you're not that good
he totally pulled this off this is one
of the greatest
persuasion plays
you'll ever see i mean it's a plus
all right as greg guffield said the
other day and i love this phrase the
public needs a hostage negotiator
to help us get out of the mandates and
lockdowns and whatever else is coming at
us
and the reason is because the
government's the wrong tool
but the public needs to weigh risk
versus you know life and we weigh things
differently so
in almost every other situation it's
better to let the government you know do
the republic thing and represent us
this is just a one unique situation
where they're the wrong tool if a war
breaks out
you don't want the public voting on it
you want the government to say well we
got this you know let us handle this
until we can sort out what's what's real
and then the public can get involved
but with the pandemic they were never
the right tool except in the fog of war
stage in which they were but at this
point they're not the right tool anymore
they were at the beginning
and the trouble is that the public
doesn't have any way to organize
short of the government itself
and the groups that might be resisting
the mandates are too you know diverse
so you've got the black americans might
be resisting at some level you've got
conservatives at some level and they
tend not to join together there are some
cases where they are joining together
but i would i would say that we need a
hostage negotiator
um adam dopamine
suggested indirectly suggested that
maybe somebody like a trump
[Laughter]
somebody like a trump
but he's i always say he's too divisive
so it would be amazing if he did that it
would be one of the greatest spectacles
of all time if you played it if you just
played a straight and literally said
look let me just negotiate this
and see if we can come up with a date or
a metric
that sets us free
but here's what i think we need i think
we need
a hostage negotiator who's not too
identified with one side or the other
to simply pick a date
and say we're all taking our masks off
if you're in a state that has masks
we're all going to take her masks off on
whatever day
and you know
that's just the day
we're we're just going to take our masks
off on that day
and maybe march first
if i had to pick a time i'd say march
1st
now you'd all like it to be sooner right
but we do have the omicron we don't know
everything that we need to know about it
and of course we could change that date
if something came up march 1st change it
but
i think we need to have a date
and
i think it would be responsible to have
that date you know not right away
give us a little time to sort out what's
true and what's not
uh
yeah and
anybody who says it should have been a
year ago i i get what you're saying
i get it
um
anyway if you can think of who'd be a
good new hostage negotiator
uh
but please don't pick me
because i feel like i'd be semi good at
it
but um i don't want it to be me
sounds like a terrible job
all right
let's talk about the great reset
you know you know before that let me
clarify my thoughts about the uh
the mass formation
psychosis i don't think i've done a good
job of telling you my
objections to it so the idea behind the
mass formation psychosis
is that there are a set of conditions
have happened that could lead to
totalitarianism
now one of the things that the
no agenda podcast said
is that since i was discounting that as
being you know
afraid of hitler
they said no no it does it's not about
hitler it's about totalitarianism to
which i say
okay
okay it's not about hitler it's about
totalitarianism which is about hitler
all right i mean i get that there's a
difference
but we're not really talking about a
real distinction here the the fear is
that
powerful people who don't have your
interests will take control
so here's what my take is on the
mass formation psychosis
it doesn't add anything
to the understanding
because we're always in it
we're always in a mass formation
psychosis in other words we're always
confused
we're we're always not sure what's
happening we're always frightened about
the future
why
why is that always the case
it's because of the fake news
did you catch this play
all right you saw you heard about the
suv that killed people
it wasn't the person driving it was the
suv you heard about this stone that
threw itself
right we keep hearing about all these
things that are happening on its own
there's no person happening doing
and now we have the mass formation
psychosis huh
that's sort of like nobody's problem is
it i mean nobody's nobody caused it
there's no name you could put on that oh
it just it just happened on its own
here's my problem with it
it's the fake news
that is the problem there is a name to
put on this
if the fake news
were telling us the truth or ultimately
just one truth even if it were fake we'd
all be on the same side and we wouldn't
be so worried
but the business model of the fake news
is to keep you
uneasy
is to isolate you and divide you
that's how the business model works once
everybody worked up and clicking on
stuff
so when you say oh the problem is a mass
formation psychosis
you have shifted blame
from the obvious guilty parties
the guilty parties are the people
running the fake news
who have removed all confidence from the
public
and scared us to death
if you scare us
at the same time you're teaching us that
all the the news is fake
how is the public going to feel
well it's going to be exactly the
situation
to create a mass formation psychosis
so i'm not saying that the conditions
don't exist because they clearly do
i'm not saying that that doesn't
contribute
to the psychosis because it clearly does
all i'm saying is
it's a diversion
it doesn't add anything
we're basically adding water to the
ocean and telling you it got wetter
yeah you might be a little bit more
confused now you might be a little bit
more aware that the the facts are fake
but we've always been here we always
were confused and hypnotized we always
were one inch away from
totalitarianism
do you know what prevents it
do you know what preventative has
prevented us so far
from descending into totalitarianism in
the united states
do you know what
partial credit for whoever is saying the
second amendment which is a lot of
people on the locals platform
i was going to say the constitution
second amendment being you know you
could say that's the
um the foundation of the constitution in
a way
you could make that argument so i'll
take i'll take second amendment as a
correct answer but i was looking for a
constitution
that we do have a set of checks and
balances however imperfect
that keep totalitarian at bay
totalitarianism at bay
now if we packed the supreme court
totalitarianism is coming
and and you know who knew that
joe biden
even joe biden knew you don't pack the
supreme court because you get rid of
your checks and balances and then yeah
then the mass formation psychosis is
going to eat you alive
it'll eat you alive as soon as you take
that protection away but the
constitution has
for a few hundred years provided us a
weird protection against it
it's like a self-correcting
system which is what makes it so magic
and
um so i do not deny
that there is a mass formation psychosis
i simply add to it then it's always here
maybe a little worse like adding water
to the ocean but not in a way that makes
doesn't help you understand anything it
doesn't tell you what to do about it
doesn't predict better doesn't do
anything
so the the cleaner story is the fake
news has so messed with us
that we're looking for any kind of
explanation and that causes psychosis so
look at the fake news don't be diverted
by a clever
but accurate
clever but accurate
idea about the mass formula formation
psychosis it's a diversion
but true-ish
there's nothing about it that's untrue
let's talk about the great reset
how many of you believe that the great
reset
is a clever plot by the elites
to gain power and control
how many of you believe that
yes yes yes yep yup yup yes yes yes yes
yes yes
well the great reset in my opinion is
nothing like that
let me let me tell you what i think it
is
so it's based on apparently in june 2020
there was the great reset was the theme
of this
annual meeting of the world economic
forum
so the first part that's true is there
was uh
the elites did get together
and talk about the great reset so that
parts
everybody agrees is true that that's
just a fact
um the topics
uh it was convened by prince charles and
blah blah blah and other people and uh
some of the topics were uh
um climate change stuff
all right and so the idea was to use the
current pandemic
and all the chaos that it creates along
with any chaos that comes from climate
change itself
to say let's rethink everything and see
if this is a situation to fix things
now
is that a
conspiracy
if a bunch of people say hey we've got a
situation to fix a bunch of things
like climate and
you know fairness and or things because
it's completely over they're showing you
their work they're doing it in public
is that a conspiracy
uh
and is is what they want power and
control
i always reject that argument because
again that's like adding water to the
ocean everybody wants power and control
everybody you want it over yourself
some people want it over other people so
that they can
have a better life themselves
but we all want power and control
there's no exceptions to that so when
you say that these uh great reset people
are looking for power and control
that's true but it doesn't say anything
it doesn't add anything
because the great reset isn't like one
thing it's just a whole bunch of people
doing things
in in a condition which is rare
which is we can stop and rethink
everything
i would say that the pandemic is a great
reset
we've rethought commuting
we've rethought health care we've
rethought pandemic
stuff we've rethought
everything
so there it is a great reset in the
sense that you can clear the slate and
say all right all right if we were going
to start today
how would you build back better so to
speak
so
i don't find anything even slightly
alarming about the great reset because
uh it's basically just a push for green
technology and maybe some more socialism
but that's already here
it's just the same stuff we've been
looking at and i don't think the great
reset gave them any extra
capability or power
you know you just saw a mansion kill
build back better
so you know it was close it was close
but it doesn't look like the great reset
is going to reset too much
here's some good news it was sort of uh
underplayed on cnn's website but i
hadn't seen it anywhere else
they said thanks to multiple atmospheric
river events which sounds very important
atmospheric river events
the average snowpack in california has
gone from 18 to 98
in two weeks
we just went from
no snowpack we're going to have another
drought because that's a big source of
our water comes from that snowpack
and
and we're having you know yet again a
drought this summer
and uh looks like
we just took a big step toward making
that big problem go away
now if you don't live in california this
meant nothing to you
but this is a big problem
not having water because we're not doing
enough to you know desalinate or
anything else so we have to rely on
nature to save us from bad government
but it looks like nature stepped in
at least for now i mean it'll still take
a lot more water to to be secure in
california but this is a big deal
a big deal like on the on the list of
all the good news that i could receive
in my life
this would be right at the top because
you have to leave california if you
don't have water that's this pretty much
came over
it's bad enough we barely have
electricity
all right
in the twitter highlights you know where
they they'll highlight a story that
everybody's talking about
yesterday they said
they had this heading to the story on
twitter said science and public health
experts say that vaccines are safe for
most people
what
most
did they downgrade vaccines from
hey everybody you know almost everybody
needs to get one
did they downgrade it all the way to
most 51
51
i mean they're not saying it's 51 but
the word most
is a pretty wide space isn't it
i don't think we can ignore
this change in messaging
i don't think you can ignore that i
think this is a pretty clear statement
that whoever wrote the headline anyway
yeah twitter uh is
is hedging
and that's
that is a big deal
in our understanding of what's going on
um
apparently uh fauci was talking about
we're going to make lots and lots of
tests for the covenant available he said
there are going to be 10 000 centers
for free testing
10 000 centers and it's going to happen
in just a few weeks
so this is heading in the right
direction of course we must ask the
question
why don't we have that already
like what took so long and i think the
answer is corruption
all right i'm going to stick with that
statement of what i consider obvious
i don't think it's incompetence i don't
think it's money
it just looks like somebody in this mix
was
corrupt
and stop something from happening for
somebody's benefit but we don't know
details
all right
china amazingly
somehow got their chinese tennis star
peng shui
who disappeared because she claimed a
communist party leader raped her
and now she's saying in an interview
that she
that never happened she'd never accused
anyone of sexually assaulting her
nope
nope it had been misunderstood
sorry nope that never happened
now would you see china disappear a
story
to take something you know is true and
just make it disappear
can they do that
yeah yeah they could do that
it works
yeah because they can do it in the
united states
so certainly you can do it in china
so certainly the people of china will
just now
hear that that never happened
um
just like stories disappear in the
united states
our media disappears stories all the
time
so yeah they can actually do this and it
will work it's so bold and so obvious
that you say to yourself well that's
never going to work it's so bold and
obvious that it's a lie
who wants me at this time of day
um anyway
so anyway the testing might be good
um
i tweeted the other day a uh
reference i think it came from wikipedia
or something it talked about how uh
galen's maxwell's dad who was a famous
media mogul
had at his funeral a lot of important
people including six
uh former or current heads of mossad
israeli
intelligence for that i was accused of
being uh adjacent to or too close to
being anti-semitic
by a david hazzani
and he called me out for
apparently an old
anti-semitic trope
that the
that israel or the jews are running some
kind of a pedo
ring
which i'd never even heard of
so my my weird my weird life is that i'm
i'm getting pilloried by people who are
literally hallucinating opinions for me
i've never heard of that
now i had heard
that intelligence agencies would be very
interested in what epstein knew and
you know what kinds of salacious stories
about important people he might know i
mean that's just obvious right the ca
cia would want to know russian
intelligence would want to know
you know mi6 would want to know and
israel would want to know why wouldn't
they
who would not want to know that
if you knew that epstein had the like
sexual goods
on a bunch of famous people
every intel agency should want to know
about that i never even heard this i've
never even heard that
is there some kind have anybody heard
this have you heard some kind of
anti-semitic thing that israel or jews
were somehow behind
some kind of a pedo ring is that even a
thing
is that anybody even i've never heard of
that
and now now i'm anti-semitic for
something i've never heard of anyway
i blocked him for being an
clay travis had a good thread today i'm
going to read you most of it
um you said joe biden passed his entire
2020 or actually i'm sorry let me read
it again joe biden based
his uh election basically on uh trusting
the science and
beating covet and of course that didn't
happen
and uh clay asked us to do this one
fundamental exercise
uh imagine that it was trump in charge
and that the pandemic went just the way
it went
you know same outcome
now let's say trump did everything that
biden did
but trump was in charge
uh clay says i believe the media would
have vigorously covered the coven
vaccine failure
true
it would have been the trump vaccine
that failed that's all it would have
been about
uh but instead it's take the vaccine
it's not as good as we thought but it's
still good
and
trump would likely have already been
impeached over his failures to take
coven seriously
could be
blue states
would shut down blah blah blah all kinds
of stuff bad stuff would happen
and then clay says the reality is almost
nothing we have done has had any impact
on covent at all do you believe that
do you believe that nothing we've done
has had any impact on covet at all
that's not even close to true
that that's not even the same universe
is true
it's true that we can't stop it
but
do you believe that the vaccines don't
reduce the
risk of serious outcomes
is there anybody here who believes that
the vaccines don't even do that
that they don't reduce the risk of
serious outcomes i'm saying yes
now conclusive
yes let's see leslie yes is on the
locals platform how about on youtube
how many of you believe the the vaccines
don't
at least
reduce your risk
now we're not talking about that they
may have bring their own risk as well
because that's real
interesting
anyway i don't think that is a statement
that should be accepted on face value i
think that face masks we don't know
because there's no way to do a
controlled trial so we don't know if
they work or not
i think that vaccines
the science
or the experts say it and all the data i
think 100 of the data says it reduces
risk right there's no data that says
otherwise
um
that i'm aware of
so i think clay goes too far
um but he makes a good point that if it
had been trump it would have been
treated completely differently
do you agree
all right here's my updated list to know
when i'm dealing with an npc somebody
who can't do independent thinking if i
see any of these phrases on the internet
now some of these are specific to me
but
these phrases are my key not to have a
debate with this person on twitter if
they mention jumping the shark
i'm really the pointy haired boss hahaha
the matrix soylent green anybody being
an apologist about anything i saw it
with my own eyes or i heard it with my
own ears sheep references 1984 movie or
book
hitler references fascism soyboy or
scotty
scotty
so if you have any of those
probably you're dealing with an npc
that's my list now i think you'd agree
this is the best show you've ever seen
possibly the best thing that's ever
happened in the history of the universe
but we've come
to the end of our
of our time here
and
right on time yeah that's how i play
right on time
all right um
and i will talk to you did i hear kamala
what's this
do you hear kamala harris said in the
only times interview we didn't see delta
coming
apparently these viruses mutate well
okay that's poorly stated
um
or here's a comment i don't understand
the no agenda podcast was not a private
conversation duh
it was meant for public consumption duh
when you subtract their persuasion
efforts how much of what's left is
cognitive dissonance
i don't know how to answer that
uh what about the great barrington
declaration
uh
you know
i just haven't been interested in it
um
all right
um aspirations issue with vaccines
aspiration issue
all right that's all for now i will talk
to you
later
