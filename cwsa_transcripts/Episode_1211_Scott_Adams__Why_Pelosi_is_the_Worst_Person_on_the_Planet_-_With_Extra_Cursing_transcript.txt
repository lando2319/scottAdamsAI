hey everybody come on in it's time
it's time for coffee with scott adams
the
best best part of the day
and something that you might remember
for the rest of your life
yeah maybe not but it's going to be good
anyway
i can promise you that especially if you
are prepared
with your copper marker glass or tanker
chalice or stein
you're a canteen jugger flask of vessel
of any kind
so long as it holds liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
except nancy pelosi join me now
well i did promise you there would be
extra swearing
and that extra swearing will be coming
at you really really hard
in a minute uh but first
i wanted to let you know that uh later
today i'm going to record an
interview with joel pollock whose new
book
is just out and you should get it it's
called
neither free nor fair the 2020 u.s
presidential elections so just go to
amazon
and google neither free nor fair now
what's interesting about it
is that it's not focused exclusively on
these
fraud claims in fact it's mostly not
about that
it's about the the entire environment
and all of the elements that went into
making this
not really the election that we thought
i'll record that later today
and then make it available on youtube
and you're going to want to hear that
because
uh i've been i'm reading it and there
are a lot of great
nuggets in there that you're really
going to enjoy
so it really pulls it all together all
right
um let's talk about nancy pelosi
so it looks like there's going to be
some minor
corroded virus bill but the big story
here
well the big story is that there are
millions of americans
who were hoping and should have expected
that their government would come through
with direct
relief packages to get them through the
toughest part of this year
and the holidays many many unemployed
and
many really struggling but instead of
that
it appears that there is little
ambiguity about the following claim i'm
going to make
meaning that even bernie sanders
seems to agree with this as do
you know republicans so i don't think
what i'm going to say now would be
really much in doubt
which is what makes this so bad it's
one thing if if maybe there's some
question about whether something has
been
framed correctly or maybe you're not
taking everything
into consideration and have you
considered that there are costs and
benefits to every decision
that's not really what's going on here
it appears that both the left and the
right are completely convinced
because pelosi basically said it herself
that she held up negotiations on this
coronavirus bill
for months for political reasons to get
past the election
so that trump would have less chance of
getting reelected
and even bernie sanders is coming
you know in his own words but kind of
pretty close to admitting that
saying that she could have gotten a far
bigger package
it didn't include this important part of
the direct
payments to people and
i i like to make the following
you put put a stake in the ground here
we can tolerate quite a bit in terms of
politics
wouldn't you say i mean the claims and
the counter claims and
bad behavior and bad decisions there are
mistakes for example
the democrats would say that president
trump made mistakes in the coronavirus
handling now how do you judge
mistakes personally i think that they're
they're exaggerating how much of a
mistake he might have made
but how do you judge a mistake remember
i told you bef
at the beginning of the coronavirus
situation
that most of our leaders would try as
hard as they can they'd listen to the
experts
but people were going to make a lot of
mistakes because it was a
new situation nobody knew exactly what
to do
some people would do better than others
but it wouldn't be because anybody was
evil or had bad intentions
or even was incompetent rather people
would be doing different things
and some of them would just work better
than others so
personally and i told you this ahead of
time i wasn't going to
judge people by the mistakes so you
haven't heard me
i don't think you've heard me ever
criticize
governor cuomo for the allegations that
you know he put coronavirus people back
in
old folks homes and it cost a lot of
lives
i i feel like the claim is true
but i personally am not taking putting
that against
governor cuomo same reason same reason
i'm not holding
any mistakes that trump did or did not
make
against him same reason i'm not holding
it against
dr fauci anybody else you can say that
there were mistakes made that's useful
but then to go further and say there's
something wrong with those people
because they made mistakes in a
situation where
mistakes were going to happen right
i feel that's too far you know i don't
want to go there i'd rather just figure
out how we can make things better
but what pelosi did
it wasn't a mistake am i right
and i don't think bernie thinks it was
exactly a mistake
because what she was doing was holding
up the process for political purposes
and what ended up as a result of that is
she got much less
she could have had lots more in fact in
fact she turned down an offer
that was vastly larger because she
wanted to stall
now are the republicans blameless in any
of this
no no i don't think the republicans in
congress
get a pass because they're all part of
the team right
team congress if you can't get it done
you don't get it done
it's on you but i would argue there's
something different
about just a person in congress who is
part of an
effort that didn't get it done and
should have you know that's worthy of
criticism
but what pelosi did
was she millions of poor
americans
for a political advantage she just
 poor people right in front of you
and didn't apologize
this is the thing that's that's taking
me to
a level of anger here that i would not
have for politics
this wasn't politics whatever this was
was closer to something like pure evil
because it's not as if the entire
country wasn't
in favor of some kind of at least by a
big majority
some kind of a direct payment to people
to keep them
keep them alive and healthy for a few
more months until we can get some
vaccines going
what nancy pelosi did is so much worse
than anything that trump has ever been
even accused of
even accused of nothing even close
you you just you know you could take the
worst things that trump is accused of
subtract out the ones that didn't even
happen you know the fine people hoax
take that out of there
you know the misinterpretations you have
to take those out of there because
they're not real they're
basically fake news tell me what trump
has ever done
that comes even close to how
purely evil this was
and i have a completely different
reaction
to somebody who at least tries to hide
their evil
had she lied about it a little bit
better
had had there been some doubt about her
actual motives and intentions
but there isn't there's no doubt it's
completely transparent evil
she put it right out there in front of
the public well
i'm gonna screw millions of americans
but i think i'll get a little
election advantage out of this for my
team
it's it's maybe one of the worst
things i've ever seen
in my whole life
we should not be treating this like a
political event
indeed if we were not i'm trying to say
this so i won't get banned
you know banned by social media
platforms
so i'll preface it by saying i of course
would never be in favor of any kind of
violence
or breaking the law so i'm not
suggesting anything i don't want anybody
to take it that way
but if you were just to look at what she
did
right in front of us right in front of
us
what she did should have a law against
it
apparently it doesn't but in terms of
the severity of how
bad that was if there were a law
it should be the death penalty
that's how bad it was there's no law
against it so she won't be punished and
of course i don't think anybody should
resort to violence for any political
stuff
but in terms of how bad it was if she
just put
millions of people into such a bad
situation
that some of them will die
she just killed people for a
political advantage
that's not too strong we know that the
you know the professionals
are pretty clear and common self sense
tells you
and your experience tells you that the
kind of pain people are suffering in
this country
at the lower end of the economic
situation
the kind of pain they're going through
and we'll go through for the next few
months
it's life and death pain it's not
inconvenient
it's not inconvenient
it's gonna kill people people are gonna
 put a gun in their mouth
and blow their brains against the drapes
because of what you did nancy
pelosi you killed people
for political advantage and you knew it
you knew what you were
 doing you absolute
monster monster
this isn't about politics and let me be
as clear as clear as possible
if trump had done this i would be
just as mad and i would think he
should be impeached
and i would be all in on impeaching his
 orange ass if he did anything
like
this there's nothing he's done
that comes
that is in this category and don't even
pretend there is
there isn't nothing
worst thing i've ever seen a
politician do
and honestly the fact that she did it
right in our faces
she's not hiding it that does make it
worse
because this is now just sort of
bullying
isn't it i mean maybe technically you
wouldn't call it bullying
but what the is it it sure isn't
being a leader
still it isn't helping it's closer to
criminal behavior
it's closer to evil behavior than it is
to even politics
to call this politics isn't a
mistake
this is somebody who should be hounded
out of office
and should never be able to live among
nice people
again this isn't politics
all right if i said enough about that
so axios is reporting that china
has a network of spies in this country
who are working are
lesser politicians with a long-term view
that if they can get some control over
mayors and people who are working their
way up from lower levels
that someday when those lower level
politicians become more important
let's say in state or national politics
that china will already have a grip on
them
in some way and there was a specific
young lady whose name is christine fang
or and this is the weird part apparently
she has
she goes by two names christine fang or
fang fang her first name fang and last
name fang
now i keep pointing this out
but it gets funnier and funnier the
longer it goes
if you've got somebody whose last name
is fang
and it turns out that they're trying to
eat you alive that's funny
right hey she's trying to eat us alive
and
she's being evil and her last name is
fang
but what does it mean when both of her
names are fang
fang fang that's like double simulation
there
that's some so apparently she got
close to my
representative locally here eric
swalwell so there's a photo of him
of her at least getting her picture
taken so she's
fo swalwell minimizes it and said it was
no big deal
but the fact that china is doing this
makes me wonder if we're doing that
too are we doing the same thing to china
because let's stop saying we're not at
war with china
we're at war with china we're at war
with china this just how the war works
now
it's persuasion and dirty tricks and
stuff
so i i'm going to just
start calling it a war because it's
stupid to not call it
anything else it's world war three yeah
um still waiting
to hear from the four people who were
i think it was four or five the last
people in the room in that georgia
situation where the people were
allegedly asked to leave
i'm still waiting for
for news of direct quotes
of who said what in terms of
was anybody saying that people should
leave
we don't have that yet what's up with
that i know one of the people
lawyered up that probably means arrested
but are you telling me our news business
can't get one of those people to say oh
what we said was
and the words we chose were and the
reason we did it was
you can't get any of the people who are
the most important people
in one of the biggest stories in the
country and not
one of them has a comment we can't find
them
the news the news can't locate any of
those people
now keep in mind i'm on the side that
says
that the video we're seeing does not
demonstrate
fraud it demonstrates something that
could be fraud
but also could be not fraud it tells two
stories very clearly but they're
different stories and that's
true of a lot of a lot of video the
covington kid
case for example depending on what you
see and what you bring to it and what
your bias is
there are two complete stories told by
the video
one something really bad happened two
nothing happened at all it's both right
there in the video
so given that situation and the relative
importance of it to
the entire you know future of the
country and the world
where the are those four people i
mean seriously
where the are those four people
now even if the story is we try to
contact them and they say no
or they won't answer their phone that's
still news
that's still news here's one of the
things i'm starting to wonder
i wonder if you could crowdfund real
news
to support fake news to replace fake
news
because the problem with fake news is
for whatever reason
neither fox news nor the left or anybody
else
seems interesting in talking to the only
people who are the important people in
this
this question suppose you just started
funding both witnesses and
news so support suppose you started a
crowdfund and you said look
uh i'll pay x reward for a whistleblower
who has a story of whatever nature
or i'll pay ten thousand dollars
for one of those four people to just sit
for an interview that
we can publish unedited ten thousand
dollars just to tell your story
because without that ten thousand
dollars apparently
we'll never hear from the four people
who are the only ones who could tell you
what they meant and what they said
and the whole case raised at rest on
that what they meant
and what they said and when they said it
etc
we should just bypass the entire news
business
and just create some kind of a fund
to find out about any story that the
news is ignoring
because it's going to be ignored on the
left and the right in some cases
so when you want to say well we'll just
fund it
fund it ourselves see what happens
all right so here's a follow-up on that
havana syndrome
you know you saw the early reports that
there might have been a quote
sonic weapon developed that was hurting
people within the
uh embassy and then it happened in a
chinese embassy too
so there are two different embassies or
was there or were there three
was canada in on that too but anyway the
the latest is a report from the national
academies of science
all right engineering and medicine and
they
they came up with a report and they said
that uh quote
directed pulsed radio frequency energy
was quote the most plausible mechanism
to explain the overseas diplomats
and their various debilitating symptoms
so there you have it do you feel that
you got your answer now because
it's the most plausible explanation
and it came from scientists so
i guess we're done here right scientists
wasn't just one scientist it was this
national academies of sciences
engineering and medicine pretty
important
i'm sure they have excellent scientists
so
um we're done here right i guess there's
just some kind of weapon that we don't
have any direct
evidence of but the only no
was the most plausible mechanism
okay let me clarify
this for you this is stupid
this is like really really stupid on day
one
i told you that the story was fake and
there was no
sonic weapon now some of you have sent
me this and said well maybe it wasn't a
sonic weapon scott
but you were surely wrong about it being
just a some kind of mass hysteria
because now real scientists have looked
into this scot
scott scott scott you and your your mass
hysteria hypothesis
i laugh at it
because actual scientists
have now debunked you you idiot
real scientists from established place
have determined that the most plausible
mechanism scott scott's got
is some kind of a pulsed radio frequency
energy
weapon that has not been directly
detected
okay i'm just a cartoonist
i'm not a scientist who is a member of
the academies of sciences engineering
and medicine
but i'm just gonna put out a thought
so you should not certainly put my
casual thought in the same category of
credibility as
my god a whole group of scientists in
the national academy of
sciences they got some real credibility
but i'm just going to
suggest a thought
which one of the scientists at the
academy's national academies of sciences
engineering and medicine which one of
them was
an expert on mass hysteria
do you think they had one what do you
think
do you think that any of the engineers
who looked into this or scientists
were any of them sort of also experts
in a a separate field
called psychology and
mass hysteria because
i'm just going to point out that the
symptoms which they discovered that were
you know across these people who had
complaints let me tell you the symptoms
see if you can determine something that
these symptoms have in common
so now you're all going to be detectives
okay
what do these symptoms all have in
common
all right so you got your there's some
people that said
that it was uh there was a loud
noise that they heard but they didn't
all have that experience
so some had one experience that others
didn't
uh one of them had dizziness and vertigo
and was up vomiting all night
but there are others that did not have
that vomiting but
others did have the vertigo where they
would lose their balance a little bit
they had cognitive difficulties
and headaches so you got your headaches
your dizziness your cognitive
difficulties
and at least some people had some
pressure they felt at one point
and some people vomited but there were
other things that were not common to all
of them
okay do you have it yet what
what would those symptoms lead you to
believe
was the most likely mechanism
for that i'm seeing people saying drugs
but if people took drugs well unless it
was slipped to them i suppose
do you think drugs would cause
these symptoms
uh i'm gonna say that maybe maybe drugs
could be food poisoning i'm saying
alcohol chemicals hangovers
let me let me give you my hypothesis
every one of these symptoms is exactly
exactly what you get with the mass
hysteria
now that doesn't mean it's a mass
hysteria i'm just saying that
if all of these symptoms could be
described by
let's say a invisible pulsed
radio frequency energy and i'm not a
scientist but i'll accept that as true
that that that would explain all of
their symptoms
maybe drugs would also explain it but
i'm no doctor so i don't know that
maybe but i'll tell you what would also
explain
every one of these symptoms
mass hysteria let me let me put it this
way
if the symptoms were people had
gangrene in their legs and they had to
have them amputated
would you say that was a symptom of a
mass hysteria
no suppose they had
broken bones would you say that's a mass
hysteria
no no you wouldn't if they had
let's say an identifiable bacteria
would you say that was a mass hysteria
no no an identifiable virus
no identifiable uh
cause that directly caused these
let's say they found a stomach virus
um here's my point
this is exactly a mass hysteria this
isn't even
this isn't even like well it might be
this is what they are they are exactly
this if you want a class on how to
identify a mass hysteria
here it is now you say to yourself but
how does that explain an unusual number
of people with symptoms
because these were real symptoms in many
cases like if somebody's vomiting
they're not imagining they're vomiting
well here's the explanation how many
people work in an embassy
i don't know the answer to that by the
way but how many people do you think
work in an embassy
now how many people work in all of our
embassies
do you think that there were that at any
time in the past year by coincidence
that any of our other embassies might
have
a few people who had headaches at the
same time
has that ever happened of course
was there anybody who had a stomach flu
at the same time somebody else was
feeling dizzy
probably right so the most unusual
the most common thing you would expect
is that with all of our embassies and
all the number of staff
you would find clusters of people being
sick
guaranteed guaranteed
all right i'm seeing some of you
complain that that's too much on this
topic
but if you can't understand how to spot
a mass hysteria you'll think stories
like this are real
and they're clearly not real
i will change my mind if somebody
produces the gun
that was a directed energy beam then
i'll change my mind
and they'll say oh well i didn't see
that coming i was wrong but until you
see that
you should if you're going to put the
odds on it i'd say
50 to 1 it's a it's a
mass hysteria i you can't rule out
the secret weapon that somebody somehow
got into china
and cuba i mean maybe
there's no motive there's no upside
but maybe it's just probably fifty to
one against it
all right um as cnn
they've got a story that says scientists
may have come up with a potential way to
make oxygen on mars
how cool would that be potential way to
make oxygen on mars and you know it's
true
because it's right here on cnn and i
read that story because
how cool would it be to be able to make
oxygen on mars
because otherwise you have to bring it
with you or something right
and you read a little bit more of the
story and the requirement to make this
oxygen with this new
proposed way would be that there's
there might be a lot of
briny liquid under the surface
and they can use a chemical reaction to
change the briny water that's under the
surface
into oxygen and i thought that's great
now what this depends on is something
which hasn't yet been discovered
that below the surface there would be a
sufficient amount of
briny liquid but we don't know that to
be true
and i thought i'm no scientist
but i feel like i have a pretty good
other idea for generating oxygen
on mars so one would be if there's briny
liquid below the surface which we don't
know to be true
that would be their idea but mine i
think is a little simpler it goes like
this
you would just drill a hole into the
surface
of mars but you'd choose your hole
so it drills into a gigantic gigantic
pocket
of oxygen that was trapped under the
surface
and then the oxygen will be released
through that hole that you've drilled
and then that will get into the
atmosphere
and you will be you have added oxygen
to the atmosphere by just releasing it
from inside the
interior of the planet so that's my idea
is there anything wrong with that idea
because you know okay yeah there's one
you could make one quibble about it
it would depend a lot on later
discovering that there's a gigantic
ball of oxygen trapped
beneath the ox the surface of mars now
we don't know that to be true
but if it is there i feel like my method
would work
to drill the hole and release it now
if it turns out that instead of a giant
ball of oxygen
it's an undiscovered unknown unobserved
gigantic bunch of liquid brine
well then their method might be better
but
it just depends what you find down there
so that was on cnn
and then then cnn talked to somebody who
actually knows what they're talking
about and the guy said
there was another expert and said uh why
wouldn't you just melt the ice
because apparently we do know there's
ice on mars
and so this guy's like uh why don't you
just melt the ice and then
you got water and then turn the water
into oxygen and i'm thinking
yeah yeah you could do that or
you could drill a hole and find the
briny liquid that may or may not exist
do you guys have this is this is just a
personal
thing right now do you have the problem
that software
rots you put a piece of software on your
computer
and you're just using your software
doesn't matter what it is
i'm using my software and then one day
it just rots it doesn't work anymore
now might be because some your operating
system
updated some compatibility but i would
love to walk into my
office someday and sit at my computer
and say i would like my software to work
just the way it worked yesterday
i sure am lucky that i got everything
working yesterday
so let me tell you that the trouble i
got into
i upgraded my mac soft my
operating system to big sur the new one
and operated and i upgraded my photoshop
because it's a subscription thing to the
newest version
so now i've got the newest of everything
so i should have no problems right
except that the line tool doesn't work
anymore
i don't know why so just drawing a line
the most basic thing besides drawing
with a brush
that i do to make bilbert it just
doesn't work anymore
and it stopped working on my other
computer
with a different operating system so i
can't draw a line on two different
complete
computer setups and i just can't do my
job now
like today i have no idea how i can be a
cartoonist
because the effort to find a new way to
produce
is pretty big and i don't know if adobe
can fix
it because it does seem to be as far as
i can tell it's just a bug it's not it's
not me being an idiot
but i i mentioned this in public and
somebody had offered a
solution and i tried the solution last
week and it worked
so last week somebody on twitter had
offered a solution and it worked
but when i rebooted it stopped working
and i couldn't figure out
how to do that solution again it looked
like it didn't even have options for it
anymore
so how do we live in a world
where they but they
you know if somebody sells you this pen
it's never gonna rot and the company
that sold it to me can't
make it rot they don't have any control
after it leaves their little pen factory
but with software they can send you the
software and then they can destroy it
from a distance they can just make it
rot
and then you need a new one it's a hell
of a situation
i'm sure you're all in it um
here's a little fake news i want to
debunk for you i saw this going around
the internet so in case you saw it
i'll tell you what the fake part is uh
there was a
a tweet going around showing some
official in pennsylvania
he was announcing uh a partial
count at some point he said that they've
counted
100 some thousand votes at whatever
point they had counted them
and they had adjudicated
um 94 as many as those
so the way people interpreted that was
wait a minute are you saying you
adjudicated 94 of all the things you
counted
meaning that almost every vote you
counted was sketchy
and you had to actually look at it like
i'm not even sure if this is a real vote
94 of them now that was the fake news
that went around
so that and and what happened was there
was a word
left out that you can just see it's not
me guessing
i'm just looking at it and say oh
sometimes they left the word out
and the word was counted
so they had done a partial count
there were lots more to count you know
maybe millions more but they'd done just
a partial count
and at the same time they had done the
partial count
separately some people were working on
adjudicating
the adjudicators were working pretty
fast and did over a hundred thousand of
them
the ones that had been counted as in run
through the
run through the counter that had just
started and they hadn't ramped up too
far
so those numbers were about similar
just by coincidence right so it's just a
coincidence
of the timing that those numbers were
kind of similar but
certainly nobody was suggesting that
most of the ballots
were sketchy and had to be adjudicated
but in terms of the election integrity
some interesting things are happening
there's the mike kelly case
that we don't i guess we don't know if
the supreme court is going to take it
yet
but if they do it could be trouble
it could be trouble for the pennsylvania
vote so here's the claim if you're not
following this
so let's say the claim is that the
the commonwealth changed the voting
process
without going through the proper
procedure as described by their own laws
therefore if the procedure was adjusted
to
add mail-in balloting if the procedure
changed
but it was not changed in the correct
way
you got a problem you had an illegal
election because it was done in a way
that the law does not support
now what do you think will happen if the
supreme court
sees that pennsylvania did what
pennsylvania wanted to do
they wanted to make that change uh it
was for the intention of you know
having more votes during coronavirus
that would be their claim anyway
and the system ran
maybe there was some fraud but not
enough to overcome
the election at least in terms of proven
fraud in court
and so what would the supreme court say
about this
would the supreme court say uh the
supreme court is
only about the rules we're we're not
we're not here to make up the law it's
pretty clear we're reading the law
there it is there's the pennsylvania law
and then here is you
violating the law it's as clear as day
there's not even going to be an argument
whether the law is violated i think
i don't believe that there's even a
counter-argument to that is there
but the supreme court
like other courts can kind of decide
whatever they want
and i've got a feeling i've got a
feeling that the supreme court is going
to say
yeah but we don't want to disenfranchise
any voters so i feel like the supreme
court is going to ignore
the law in their ruling which they can
do
they can just you know make up a reason
for it and say well
yeah technically that was against the
law but given the emergency situation
and given that it was
clearly intended for the benefit of
people
and you were not going to disenfranchise
people over a
technical infraction
that's kind of how i think it'll go what
do you think
i don't see it succeeding now
ted cruz will be arguing it which
i think gives it a far better chance of
succeeding than
somebody less capable as you note well i
hope you know
ted cruz has argued uh cases in front of
the supreme court he used to be
solicitor
what is it solicitor general of texas so
he's deeply experienced
in exactly this stuff and he's
one of the best people you could ever
imagine for doing
this stuff so at least it will be
um a really good
contest all right it won't be like these
things that are getting thrown out of
court
at the lower courts this is going to be
a fun contest but if i had to predict
i would predict that the supreme court
would ignore the constitution
and would ignore the law and just say
yeah it's just not big enough deal
i think we're going to keep it the way
it is i think
related to that the state of texas has
filed a lawsuit
that kind of dovetails with this one but
goes further and apparently texas
can challenge the elections in other
states
which is interesting did you know that
that texas can challenge the
elections in other states so they're
challenging some of the swing states
saying that the uh uh and one of their
arguments is that
there was unequal uh protection meaning
that
within the state not texas but they're
challenging other states
they're within those states that there
were different rules applied
even within the state so
if if you as a voter in one of these
states
which would be michigan pennsylvania
wisconsin and georgia
if you were in one of those states and
you were in a let's say a county or
precinct
they handle things differently maybe
maybe it was to your disadvantage
so you don't have the same rights as
somebody you know
in a neighboring county in your own
state
how big a deal is that
i feel like that's not really much of a
case honestly
uh and don't worry about my opinion
because my opinion is not going to
influence the outcome
i feel as if the courts would once again
say
yeah we see your point texas yeah you
you've proven it factually yeah it's
important to have equal protection
and yes you've proven that it didn't
didn't occur
but i think they're going to say it's
too small of an
infraction i think they're going to say
yeah it was imperfect
but every election isn't perfect and by
the way
you can't make it equal for everybody
all the time
somebody says you're wrong scott i could
be wrong certainly i wouldn't listen to
my opinion on the supreme court but i
wanted to put that down as my
prediction because it's good for you to
compare my predictions to reality
um and i also think
wouldn't even a perfect re election
if you did everything right wouldn't it
still be
incredibly unequal because
is it fair to somebody who doesn't read
well
is it fair to somebody who only watches
cnn and therefore doesn't see the news
is it fair to somebody who's smart as
you know versus somebody who's not dumb
who's not smart enough to
understand the issues i feel as if you
can't get equal protection
so i think the court would say ah it's
too small
all right i found a new way to
reply to straw man arguments you know
the straw man argument is where
i'll say something like i believe in my
opinion the sky is
blue and then my critic will come in and
say
scott says the sky is orange stupid
idiot
he should check his sources now that
would be a straw man
because i never said this guy was orange
in fact i said
very different i said the sky is blue
but people
rarely argue with me about what i've
actually claimed
it's actually pretty rare people always
argue with me
about some weird hallucination that
they've made up in their own head that
they think
is my opinion and how dumb is that so i
was dealing with one of those people
today and i
came up with a witty rejoinder
that i'd like to recommend to you feel
free to borrow this
and use it online all right so after
somebody misrepresents
your opinion you can say this
i don't think you could find my point if
it were stapled to your balls
and then kind of leave it there i
wouldn't do a follow-up on that
you couldn't find my point if it were
stapled to your balls
doesn't work as well if your critic is
female but
most critics are male so it should work
most of the time
feel free to use that i ran a
twitter poll which as you know are not
scientific
but they can be fun and i said which of
these three groups is responsible for
the most
systemic racism so emphasis on the
systemic part
in 2020 so which of these groups is most
responsible for systemic racism in 2020
and i listed these three groups the kkk
neo-nazis and teachers unions
now of course my followers tend to skew
right two percent of them said the kkk
3.4 of them said neo-nazis are
responsible for the most
systemic racism and 95
of the respondents said the teachers
unions
now uh
i think we're at a point where at least
the people on the right
understand how bad the teachers unions
are for society and civilization
that's a pretty big number now again
it's not a scientific or even close to
it
but i feel as if even democrats
might come to the same conclusion you
know i don't know how many democrats
answered this probably not many
but i'm not sure they would disagree
with it too much
if they were if they understood the
issue
if they understood the issue as the
teachers unions
deny the opportunity for competition
with schools and if you don't have free
choice and competition among schools
the bad schools will stay bad because
they have no competition they can just
stay bad
so black people living in places where
there are bad schools
are absolutely the victims of systemic
racism
because the system is not allowing them
to
have the same kind of opportunities as
other people so that's systemic racism
now is that a legacy from slavery i'd
say yes
i'd say yes i mean you could say lots of
other variables
but i think that's fair to say that the
teachers unions are systemic racism
and that and the biggest part i would
say that they're not just
fitting into the category they're most
of the category i'd say 80 percent of
systemic racism is directly the teachers
unions
even if it plays out in other ways and
the point is
that if the teachers unions were not
there
and if you had free choice you would
eventually get to the point through
competition where everybody'd have a
better school opportunity
and i'll tell you if you're black in
america and you've got a great education
there's still racism you know it's one
of those things that you can't
completely get right away with
but you're going to have a damn good
life
if you're black in america with a strong
education
you're not going to suffer economically
i mean all other things being equal
so at least it won't hurt you as much
the racism if you're
if your economic situation is doing well
l.a county district attorney george
gascon
has issued some rules to end
civilization as we know it
does that sound like an exaggeration
could a district
attorney in la end civilization
with a rule change well
i think he is here's the rule change
they're not going to prosecute the
following crimes
trespassing disturbing the peace
driving without a license prostitution
and resisting arrest
it's that last one that's the big
problem
i don't mind if they get a little uh if
they go easy on
prostitution driving within a license
you know maybe those just
should be fines or something whatever uh
but trespassing seems like a pretty big
one
i mean if somebody just walks through
your open door if you forget to lock
your door can somebody just come into
your house
and just hang out in your house for a
while i know that seems like a problem
but resisting arrest is is the end of
civilization
and once i heard that you could resist
arrest in la
i thought i could make a lot more money
as a criminal
in la because i would just resist the
rest
and how long could i resist arrest
and get away with it if you're not going
to prosecute it
it's like stop you're under arrest
nice try that's that's 2019 talking
watch me go bye
big bag of jewels i just stole these
jewels
from that house over there yeah i know
i'm under arrest
hey do you know any other houses
that i could rob because i'm you know
i'd like to fill up my bag it's only
half filled with jewels
maybe how about this i'll be over there
i'll be robbing the other mansion
i know you'll be waiting for me out
front i'll see you out front when i'm
done
stuff and stuff in my bag two bags full
of jewels and
ipods and stuff and all the police are
waiting for me on the lawn they got the
guns out and there's some
stop you're under arrest i'd be like i
know
i'm under arrest watch this
and they say stop or we'll
we can't shoot you stop or we'll keep
yelling at you
and i'll say i know i know
this is the greatest country in the
world
with my bag of jewels so
i i feel as if staying where i am in
northern california
and continuing to be a cartoonist is
kind of a sucker's play
because i'm working all day to get money
i mean it's a good job sure but i still
have to work
i would rather just to go into people's
houses and businesses and just take what
i want
because that's the new model according
to the district
district d.a in la all right
so we got that the ceo of
goya foods who as you know at one point
aoc calls for a boycott of his products
and apparently what happens when aoc
calls for a boycott of your products is
that
sales go way up the conservatives band
together i bought some
you know i i've never had i've never
bought this product in my life but
i went out and bought some just because
aoc said to
boycott it and they said our sales
jumped so we named
aoc the employee of the month
let me say that again the ceo of goya
foods
who has visited with presidents democrat
and republican
he's just sort of a person that people
like to talk to i guess
you must be kind of awesome he talked to
president trump he's talked to obama and
other presidents
but because he talked to trump aoc
called for a boycott
and conservatives rallied around him and
his
sales went up so much that they named
aoc employee of the month
slo clap anybody will you join me
in a slow clap for the ceo of goya foods
whose name i didn't write down but he's
awesome
good job i feel as if this is a model
for the future to
to kill all these boycotts can't we
can't we do this every time can't we
have a list of who they're boycotting so
we can go out
and go buy their product i'll do it
i mean i i'll buy every product that
gets boycotted by aoc
period i don't even need it you know i
got a lot of extra cash
i didn't need these goya whatever beans
i bought those i'll buy some goya
beans if if it happens again
all right my last story terribly
important
uh apple computer has come out with a
new product
over the year uh airpods i guess i call
them so they're wireless
wireless over-the-ear headphones
just in time for christmas and what do
you think they priced them at
how much you would you pay for apple
over-the-ear headphones
how about 549
before tax 549
before tax and here's the reason i
brought this up
i i hate you apple computer
in a good way i'm i'm kidding when i say
this
i hate you and here's why i hate you
i don't want this product
but you made me want it
stop that what kind of stupid magic is
this
i don't need this it's not a product i
need it's not what i want
i really love you know the the regular
earbud things
i'm hooked on these these are one of the
best one of the best products
ever made i mean these are seriously
seriously good american
you know prod product making right there
but i really i don't really need an
over-the-ear kind
but they inspire it but they apple in
their marketing
they inspire an irrational product
lust that you can just feel
right you can just feel it and
i know i'm going to resist this product
as long as possible
but damn it i want one
i want it i've never even seen them in
person
i have no use for it seems way
overpriced
but why did they make me want this thing
how did they do that
how do they make you want something you
don't want
you know here's a little thing which you
might not know about
so those of you who waited
you get this little easter egg here
did you know that when eisenhower was
president
he quite wisely realized that the
military
protection of the country was very
related to the economy and
in the 50s people had learned to be not
very
consumer-ish you know that they'd gone
some of them had gone through the
depression
they'd lived through a war with
rationing and it really wasn't a big
deal
to keep up with the neighbors and buy
gadgets and products and stuff
and it was eisenhower who said we need
to become a country that consumes a lot
because that will drive our economy
that'll make us a strong country and
we'll make our defense better so
eisenhower was a pretty
smart dude as it turns out with whatever
advisors
and he realized that he had to change
the psychology of the country
from i don't need that i already have an
old one
why would i need a new whatever if i
have an old whatever and it's working
just fine
if it ain't broken don't replace it and
he changed that
to a psychology of lust now
eisenhower didn't do it himself he hired
experts in the let's say the advertising
and persuasion field
to make the citizens think they had to
have this stuff
so this lust i was talking about for
these apple headphones
is sort of the historical you know
legacy
of a country that's been programmed to
want things it doesn't need
so our whole psychology has yeah bernays
that's the name of edward bernays if
you're going to look it up
bernays b-e-r-n-a-y-s
i think is a spelling so look him up so
he was he was a guy who figured out how
to manipulate
humans making commercials make us want
things
until we became a massive consumer
country
and that worked totally worked
we became a consumer country we became
the strongest country in the world
and we were brainwashed into that
so watching that process you realize
that the psychology of the public is is
the most
probably the most critical part
of the engine and he got the psychology
right
and that lasted for a long time what
we're watching now
in politics and in the country is it is
the destruction
of our psychological engine the the
thing that
that we all agreed on even if it was
irrational we agreed on
we agreed we want to buy stuff for
christmas
it's irrational mostly but we as long as
we agree with it it becomes a
psychological
structure and that's sort of falling
apart now
but will it be replaced with something
worse or will it be replaced with
something better
my guess is that because we have
sufficient freedom
and market competition and lots of
brilliant people
that it's far more likely that whether
you want to call it a great reset
i don't buy into that framing but
certainly there are going to be a lot of
changes
we're going to we will be going through
a period
of phenomenal change
and i feel as though
we're up to it i feel like we're up to
the challenge
i feel as if uh like any good company
and if you if you're not familiar with
business strategy this isn't so obvious
but if you're a company that makes a
product and it works really well
you still have to make a product that
kills your old product
because somebody else will so you have
to be constantly uh eating your own
you know eating your own products and
destroying yourself
as the process of growth right you have
to destroy to rebuild
and we're going to go through the most
massive psychological
destruction maybe in our history
so when eisenhower built this thing
which is
this consumer economy it wasn't
replacing
much of anything it was replacing people
not caring
but now we've got a thing you know once
it's created now it exists
you have to destroy that thing to make
space for whatever is a new thing
i believe that we are smart enough
to do that well in a in a thousand
different ways
invention a b testing rapid
communication
i think we have all the tools and the
skills and the ability
that maybe it's time to just push the
flush handle
on the old way of thinking on a lot of
stuff
and just make a lot of our old
assumptions go away
even basic stuff i've said that the
consumer
impulse and the free market is
unsustainable
at this point we need to have some kind
of a separate life
for people who just are not going to be
on that train
who still need to buy food still need to
raise kids still need to have a life
there needs to be something that isn't
as expensive
as the normal way we do it maybe as an
alternate thing etc
so i would say the the future probably
is going to be a ubi
i think uh yang was way ahead of the
curve on that
i think there will be ubi um
i don't know if there'll be restaurants
in the future i'm not
think about the fact that their
restaurants
are such a big part of the experience of
at least people who have a certain
amount of income
and that restaurants closed
and you didn't really die right it turns
out that going to restaurants is this
sort of weird artificial
business that built up and became
massive
but we didn't really need it we liked it
didn't really need it i would not be
surprised if restaurants just go away
now one of the reasons i got out of the
restaurant business besides the fact
that it wasn't making money
was that it didn't look like it ever
could make money
the the restaurant business when i
exited it
looked like a business that couldn't be
a business in the future
there might be a few mega chains like
you know cheesecake factories or
whatever
but it was obvious that the independent
restaurant business
didn't have any future it couldn't
possibly work and i think the
there's a big there's a really big red
pill out there
that i i didn't want to be the first one
to tell you about
but i feel like it's about time
the restaurant business is not good for
the economy
i don't think it's that good for the
economy now that's an exaggeration
so anything that creates economic
activity is probably good
but restaurants tend to barely survive
you know there it's just the you it's
your
low-income jobs and they're barely
making a profit
most of them are cheating on their taxes
uh
they're supported by some other entity
if you look in my town the most
successful restaurant and probably the
one of the few that will survive this
pandemic
it's only because he owns the real
estate
so the guy who owns the restaurant is
lucky enough to own the building it's in
so he doesn't have to pay rent to an
evil landlord he's owned it a long time
it's probably paid off
so the restaurants that can succeed in
the future will be
special cases like that one where he
just happens to own the building
so his cost structure is different than
everybody else's
but short of that the days where you can
be a
independent operator rent a space
you don't own the building put in your
restaurant and make a lot of money just
doesn't exist
and i would argue that the restaurant
industry
was going to be gone in
maybe 10 to 20 years and this
accelerated it
this is something that naval ravikant
said
before i heard anybody else say it that
that the pandemic would simply
accelerate things that were going to
happen anyway so if you're looking at
how can we rescue the restaurant
business
you know having been in the business i
have the maximum empathy
for everybody involved especially the
employees
but the truth is i don't know that it
can be rescued
the truth is i think the future is no
restaurants
of the independent kind
i imagine the restaurant of the future
that would work if it were independent
would look like this
it would be living space above a
workspace
so the restaurant owner could live
upstairs with the family
and downstairs would be a robot
uh or basically a robot restaurant so
robots could make soup and salads pretty
easily because it's just you know
chopping and adding stuff
pretty soon robots will be able to make
a sandwich
some can already do that cook a steak
etc better than a human
so i would imagine that there will be
robot serving
restaurants and uh
it's just not a business that will ever
look the same 10 years from now
so that's all i got for now and i will
talk to you
later
all right you youtubers sorry i made you
hungry
is there any reason that a robot can't
make a soup
doesn't it seem to you that the the the
most obvious thing that you
you do is make a soup restaurant
that just has you know robots in the
back not the kind that walk around but
you know
fixed fixed robots that are doing
nothing but cleaning
and chopping things and and combining
them into a
into a liquid just dropping stuff into a
into a liquid it feels like this would
just be the most obvious
first robot restaurant would be
soup and maybe salad because that's just
chopping
that's what i think you have to get rid
of the employees or you're not going to
be able to make a business out of it in
the future
somebody says do i think that
directed energy weapons are likely to
exist oh yeah
yeah i think they're likely to exist
yeah
that is true um
voting machines expert
okay what about the
i'm seeing a lot of comments i don't
really even understand the comments so i
don't know how to respond to them for
the most part
yeah china fentanyl i can't believe we
let that go
if i were president i would say look
here's the deal i'm just going to close
all of the embassies
we're not even going to have a
conversation with you
china until you get rid of your top
fentanyl dealer whose name we gave you
it's not like you don't know where he is
doesn't like you don't it's not as if
you don't know his name
it's not as if he can't pick him up and
it's not as if you don't know exactly
what he's doing because he's doing it
you know with the approval of the
chinese government of course
as long as you let that guy be free we
should not have
any relationship with china we should
just cut relations
that that should be the that should not
be a negotiation
uh i think you've seen trump do this in
some cases and it's a good technique
if you say that everything is a
negotiation people will treat it that
way
so if you say to china all right we've
got a lot of problems let's negotiate
these all we got the fentanyl thing and
the trade deals and
the ip and stuff if you do that that's
just the wrong approach
what you should say is we've got a bunch
of things to negotiate
but we're not even going to talk to you
until you fix
stop killing us with fentanyl you can't
negotiate with somebody who's
actively killing you meaning your people
you don't negotiate with them in a war
maybe you'd have to because that's your
only choice
but not in a this situation you don't
negotiate with people who are killing
you by the tens of thousands that's
crazy and and and by the way let me be
as clear as possible
trump failed on the
chinese fentanyl topic as hard as you
can fail
he completely failed on that and
i'm not happy about that so i would say
that would be in the top
three trump failures during his term is
uh is the fentanyl thing i don't think
biden will do any better of course
but that's a major that's a really big
failure
because i think trump could have taken
care of that at least by killing that
guy
i think we should have killed him in
country
um using whatever we could we'd just
drop a drone on them whatever we should
have killed them
but that was my opinion and that's all
for now bye for now
