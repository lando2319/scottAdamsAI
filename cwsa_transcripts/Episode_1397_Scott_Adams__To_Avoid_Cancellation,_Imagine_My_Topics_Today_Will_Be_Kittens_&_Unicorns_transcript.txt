hey everybody
come on in come on in you're all the
smart
and punctual people yeah it says uh says
a lot about you
that you're here on time you've got a
routine you've got a system
appears to be working really well
and let me tell you
a little bit about the good news before
we do the simultaneous up we'll wait for
people to come in here a little bit
but i gotta tell you i had an experience
last night that made me feel
great no not that get your minds out of
the gutter
um i went to dinner last night in town
my local town
with christina and as you know a lot of
the restaurants have
gone to outdoor seating well in my town
they went outdoor seating but they also
started
closing the street to traffic on the
weekends
so for three nights you can just walk
the streets
and i was there last night
and i've lived here i guess all of my
adult life
i have never never seen
my town that happy
full of people all the restaurants
packed
could barely get a reservation anywhere
in town and there are a lot of
restaurants
the place was a circus
everybody had a smile on their face
people were just walking down the
streets
masks off people were eating
masks off and everybody was just
looking at everybody's faces
we were looking at each other's faces
and it was amazing it was amazing
it was the best time i've ever seen my
town have
and it was just a friday night it wasn't
like a celebration
there's something happening people now
if it hasn't happened in your town yet
maybe it will remember i told you before
the pandemic
that i felt we were on the cusp of a
golden age
and then the pandemic hit and people
said
well that's a pretty bad golden age
you've got going there
but it seems i could be wrong
but it seems to me that the pandemic was
necessary unfortunately
it was necessary and
look at all the things that are that are
emerging right after
or during the pandemic number one our
nuclear energy program looks better than
ever
not just in the world but the united
states has got some good stuff going
that speaks to climate change it speaks
to space exploration
it speaks to clean energy it speaks to
electric cars and speaks to everything
all right it's a big deal and it's
happening
we're going to mars maybe thank you elon
and
nasa we've got this mrna platform
that was sort of uh tested out now
during the pandemic might cure a whole
bunch of other diseases from hiv to
to malaria possibly
that's in the pipeline we've got remote
work has gone from
something you could do sometimes to a
standard
food delivery by standard we have more
jobs and we have worse
right we'd like lower unemployment but
at the moment
we have more jobs than we have employees
so i think we're really on the verge of
something
pretty great pretty great
i i hate to jinx it but it looks like
the golden age is here
do you think we should drink to that
who's with me
do we have any optimists here today in
the comments
i'll get ready for the simultaneous step
tell me
do you feel optimistic because man i
really feel it
i'm i'm just looking at your comments
now i'm seeing a lot of
scenes some no's so some of you haven't
turned the corner yet and i understand
that completely
i'm seeing some guesses more no's than
yes's okay
i'm seeing some i'm saying big time yes
let's f and go feels great none
let's go yes okay it's a little bit
mixed
katherine is pregnant good for you
catherine you found something to do
during the pandemic
sounds like it was good all right well
the golden age of course
won't bring everybody along at the same
rate but we'll see what we can do
but until then all you need is a copper
mug or glass
a tanker gel system a canteen jogger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that will kick off
the golden age
it's called the simultaneous zip it's
better than anything
and it's going to happen now all over
the world
kicking off the golden age go
all right uh fake news alert fake news
alert uh i'm guilty
of retweeting some fake news which i
have now deleted uh the fake news was
that
uh on june 15th california
some people interpreted the government
statement incorrectly
to say that things would not be opening
up on june 15th
when they planned but rather he was only
talking about the state of emergency
so the state of emergency will stay in
play
which is fine i mean we may need it
but uh it looks like even california
might open on the 15th
so big big deal
um all right the topic that i wanted to
talk about today
i didn't mention in the title because
um we discovered that youtube
demonetizes these live streams
upon as soon as they start now how could
they demonetize them
as soon as they start because you don't
know what the content is
i haven't done anything i haven't done
anything good or bad it just started
and we're making the assumption that
they're looking at the title
because they must be picking up some
keywords in the title
so this is an experiment to see if i get
demonetized
upon the beginning if i don't have
anything in the title that's
bad the topic today is
[Applause]
ivermectin have you heard of it
so the the question is this there is
this uh
widely available existing drug called
ivermectin
it's kind of a miracle drug for other
stuff
and i i think the guy who came up with
it won a nobel prize it's a really big
deal
but it has not been used in this
specific context
and there are lots of trials of it uh
that individually are not the highest of
the gold standard type
so you've got a whole bunch of trials
about this drug that's widely available
and
if they're the claim let's say the i'm
going to
speak of it this way the claim
made by a number of people is that if
you look at these
many different trials and tests
that if you looked at any one of them
it's not
quite that really large scale randomized
you know gold standard trial so there
does not exist
the one good reliable trial that you
want
what does exist is lots of little ones
that have issues
sometimes it's because the trial size
isn't that big
sometimes maybe there's some
imperfection maybe it's not that kind of
a trial
maybe they're just looking at results
which is different than the randomized
control trial
but the claim is this that no matter
what you look at
it works so well that you can see it
easily that you don't
have to be some kind of virologist
to see that where it's used the effect
is so big
again allegedly this is not my claim but
allegedly the effect is so big
that you don't really need to be an
expert to see that it works
and you don't really need to be much of
an expert to know that the drug is
harmless because it's been in the market
for other purposes for so long
now the mystery is this if there are so
many smart and qualified people
saying that this drug works
why is it not being used everywhere
what's going on and
i was just watching brett weinstein
interview dr
pierre corey who's a md but also
you know highly experienced in the the
researching parts of
being a doctor and uh
thank you for that um and
so it's a real by the way if you're
interested in the topic i would
recommend it so just
um if you just google ivermectin and
brett weinstein i think it'll pop right
up on youtube
and i don't know what the story was was
it banned for a while but now it's back
is there some story about youtube
tweeting it
um differently oh elizabeth you're
getting ahead of me
i thought i was going to be so clever i
was going to make this clever point and
elizabeth already beat me to it but i'll
but i'll uh i'll get to it how do you
how do you explain the mystery
that so many smart people say it works
and definitely works
this is what the smart people say not
only that it works
it clearly definitely absolutely works
it's not even close
what's up with that let's let's dig in
here's my hypothesis which i would bet a
lot of money being right
all right i can't guarantee this is
right
but if i had to bet a lot of my own
money on it i would and it goes like
this
it's a fake news problem and it's a fake
news
slash intersection with trump problem
slash your academy hydroxychloroquine
what does the ivermectin story remind
you of
hydroxychloroquine it was an existing
drug
very safe in its other uses suggested
that it might
also work for uh covid
many many trials but there they weren't
none of them seemed to be the
the right kind but yet there were so
many anecdotal and other reports
that it seemed clearly obviously
unambiguously like hydrox chloroquine
must work
according to lots of smart people really
highly qualified
virologists etc but they would admit
they didn't have
the other randomized controlled gold
standard
thing now as time went by
of course president trump was demonized
for that and it became
one of the several most
most often noted examples
of how president trump was anti-science
or denied science or didn't understand
science or
promoted junk science whatever they
wanted to say
now after watching trump get annihilated
for claiming there might be an existing
drug
that shows lots of promise and that the
risk reward of using it might make sense
he was completely demonized now
ivormectin comes along
the story is exactly the same it's just
a different drug
but the story looks pretty similar
now i'm not going to claim that the
trials or the tests of those two drugs
were similar
because they might not be but if you're
listening to the story
and let's say you're uh you're a top
virologist
and somebody says to you hey can you
look at this these studies
and if you think it's telling us
something can you say it in public
so people will know it's got some
credibility would you do that
if if your if your life and your career
and your reputation
depended on it being right would you go
in public
if you were an expert and say you know i
think this ivermectin looks like the
thing
well a few experts have this this uh
the guest that brett weinstein had dr
pierre corey
so he did exactly that but where were
the other people like
all the other industries and all the
other people where were they
you know are they jumping in and saying
oh yeah same same i'm with you
nope because it would be career
not necessarily suicide
but it would be a bad risk reward
for you personally it might be the best
risk reward ever
for the public it might be the best risk
reward we've ever seen
for the world maybe i mean i'm not
making that claim
but it's bad for the person
so you've got a whole bunch of people
who don't want to be the next
trump right because the fake news
so demonized trump that you just
couldn't do anything that even
sounded like it anything that felt like
that hydroxychloroquine story
it just made it impossible for this
other drug to get a good hearing
am i wrong now of course it also didn't
have the backing of you know major
pharmaceuticals who could make lots of
money on it because it's an existing
drug
and so it didn't have a didn't have
anybody promoting it who has
let's say tons of money and influence
and can really make something
happen so nobody like that existed and
no individual
wanted to walk in front of a firing
squad it would be suicide
or or
maybe it doesn't work all right
thanks craig um
here's the counterpoint so
you know i have uh some my go-to's
when when i have one of these questions
where there's some data there's some
interpretation
so i look to andres backhouse i mention
him often you should follow him on
twitter
and he's really good at looking at data
and picking it out
this morning for example he looked at
one of the studies
and said well the one i'm looking at is
garbage i'm
paraphrasing he didn't use that word but
one of the ones looks like you could
have sort of selected what worked and
what didn't and maybe it didn't even
show anything worked and it was a mess
so i'm doing a bad job of explaining why
it's sub-optimal
but let's just say he looked at one and
it was a mess now the argument is
yes we know that some of these
individual trials are are weak
either because there weren't enough
people or how they did it or whatever
but if you do a meta-analysis in which
you take
all of the weak studies and sort of find
a way to
rationally sum them together which i'm
doing a bad job of explaining
then the theory is that any individual
mistakes
that you know one or two of them make
will sort of get averaged away
by the other ones that didn't make that
mistake but maybe the other one made a
different mistake
but their mistake would get also
averaged away by the other stuff did
that make sense
did i do a good job of explaining that
so the meta-analysis
thanks seth the meta-analysis is
supposed to correct for the smaller
problems that any individual study had
by looking at the big picture
when you do that claims dr
pierre corey and brett weinstein seems
to have looked at it as well
when you do that it looks like it's
amazing
it looks like it's really amazing
so meta-analysis
is a solid method there's lots of
material for it to look at
and we have a perfectly strong
hypothesis
of why other experts are not jumping all
over it
are you sold have i sold you yet
that that the analysis is good the data
is solid
there must be some kind of mystery about
why people are
not promoting it when it's so clear that
it works
are you all sold no other questions
i'm not i'm not going to be honest with
you
i'm not convinced now part of it is
andre's
backhouse is too persuasive about this
stuff and he's not convinced
i need to see him convinced to be honest
with you because i can't
i don't have the skills to look at the
data myself but i've seen him be right
enough
that i don't want to be on the other
side see where i'm going with this
now part of his explanation is that in
economics apparently
people don't like to use meta analysis
because i'm doing a bad job of
explaining this i know
but when you do the meta analysis
apparently there's some subjectivity
about how you deal with the individual
trials in other words you could choose
what data to emphasize or not within an
individual trial
what results to show or not show and by
the time you've summed it up
you've included a bunch of subjectivity
in it
this would be the counter the
counterpoint to why a meta-analysis
is good is that there might be a little
subjectivity into it
what do you say would you say that
that the case is made or would you say
wait a minute
are you telling me that a meta-analysis
is not
a standard that everybody would say
works all the time
and that that is what i'm telling you
it's not a standard
that smart people say works all the time
it's still a really good thing to do
apparently and it probably works a lot
of the time
maybe even most of the time i don't know
but it doesn't mean it's true
because there's just enough subjectivity
in here that you can kind of get what
you want
now or or there's a potential that you
could get what you want i wouldn't make
that claim here
because the claim that i've rejected is
that the signal is so strong
you could do a lot of stuff wrong and it
would just still be obvious
it's just so big let me give you an
example
in the real world let's say every time
you walk out your back door
uh a pile of money falls from the sky in
front of you
you look up and you're thinking did that
come out of an airplane or
a drone or it's just a bag of money and
you pick it up and you put it in your
bank and everything's fine nobody asks
for the money back
next day you walk out another bag of
money
but if you walk out your front door no
bag of money
so if you walked out your bag your back
door ten times in a row
and nine of those times a bag of money
fell from the sky and you got to keep it
and nobody complained
would you refuse to walk out your back
door
because there is no randomized
controlled trial
to prove that it will happen again or do
you say i think i live in the real world
and one of these doors is working a lot
better than the other door
in the real world you're going to do
what works it
based on your observation so
you have to be careful about being over
reliant
on the science that you don't know is
right
and being maybe dismissing your
observations that are really obvious
so do i need a randomized controlled
study to know i should go out my back
door
no no it'd be great if i had one
but if i get a bag of money 10 times in
a row i'm going to go out there on the
11th time
you know that
speaking of hydroxychloroquine i feel
that at this point if it worked as well
as people hoped
i feel like we'd know it and
a lot of the reason that we think it
works is that doctors say
i give it to all my patients when they
have their first symptoms
and they recover quickly
just like almost everybody whether they
get it or not
don't most people recover quickly i was
listening to
uh dr pierre corey talk about i think it
was
maybe one study or his own observation i
forget which it was
but he mentioned the fact that when
people take the eye vermectin
that at least one of their symptoms
because there's usually a
constellation of symptoms if you have
coven he says that at least one of your
symptoms
seems to go away really quickly
so therefore strong indication
anecdotally strong indication that the
ivormectin works to which i say
anytime i've had a constellation of
symptoms
one of them goes away sometimes before
the other ones
i don't know that all my symptoms always
go away at the same time do they
so i feel like that standard of one of
your symptoms goes away quickly
i feel like that just might have
happened on its own
as long as the other symptoms are still
there so
i'm not i'm not so sure that i'm sold
on meta analysis i would like to know
more about the
reliability of such things in general
in the medical field now if we accept
that a meta-analysis
is not often used in economics
what's the difference
is it because economists
have greater insight is it because
an economics question maybe has less at
stake
than a medical question i don't know
why would it be that a meta-analysis
which effectively is just a way of
looking at data right
why would it be that in economics they
shy away from them
but we're talking about it being a near
proof in the medical field
don't you need to know that wouldn't you
like to know why is it one field says
it's no big deal and the other says yeah
this is pretty good
is it because economics and and science
and health are just different enough
i don't know so here's one way that i
look at
trying to figure out what is true number
one
do we have a theory a hypothesis that
makes
good sense for why experts would ignore
this if it worked
and the answer is yes we have a really
really good hypothesis
which is it just sounds too much like
hydroxychloroquine
and that is exactly how people are wired
so everything you know about how people
are wired how the world works
how personal incentive works how people
protect their own ass
every part of this story is consistent
with the possibility that it's a
really effective drug that works and
hasn't been promoted the way it should
be
but it's also in the category
of things that later turn out
to be really really
often let me tell you what turns out to
be
really really often things that don't
have a randomized
controlled study there's a reason
there's a reason that people require
that stuff because there are so many
examples where if you don't have the
randomized controlled
trial you don't know what's going on
even though you're positive
so while i get i certainly understand
the argument
that uh very much like my example of
walking outdoors and getting a bag of
money every time
if if your real world experiences that
something is working
i guess you wouldn't do more of it but
it's in the category of things you can
be fooled by
really easily so i'm on the fence on
this one so here's my bottom line
50 50. if you said
scott you don't know if the ivermectin
works you're not a medical guy you can't
even look at the studies
the people who do might have different
opinions what are you going to do
i'm about 50 50. meaning if i had to bet
on it
i don't know it's a coin flip
let's see in your comments and by the
way
the only reason that i doubt the
argument
is number one i haven't heard enough of
the counter arguments
in other words i'd like to hear a
virologist say well i looked at all
these same studies
and i didn't get that conclusion does
that person exist
here's the thing you have to worry about
when you see this format
of a host talking to one expert so
that's what
brett's show was it was uh
one host who is very knowledgeable about
sciencey stuff
um talking to another knowledgeable
person
how much should you trust that if that's
your model of where you got your
information
one host talking to one expert
forget about the topic all you know is
that it's one host
talking to one expert how much do you
trust it
what what trust would you put on that
model one person talking to one expert
and that's all you know
zero that's right the correct answer is
zero
if that's all you know is you watched
one youtube with one expert
who had one opinion on one side the
credibility you should put on that is
zero
right now if you get to see the other
expert
who might disagree and i don't even know
if that person exists
literally i don't know if such a person
exists
but you need to know that right if
nobody exists on the other side well
we're done
right at least in terms of the odds of
who's right
but if they do exist and i don't know if
they do
what is their argument right
so that there's a there's this big black
hole
of what's the other side of the argument
and anytime you see this
model of one person and one expert you
should automatically go to zero
on your your belief system now it could
be important
and it could be right and it could be
the beginning of your journey of
you know checking the other sources and
coming to an opinion
but do not give that model of
information more than zero
that's just a huge mistake it is zero
percent
credibility even if it's right remember
when i talk about
credibility i'm not talking about
whether it's right
because sometimes you can't know the
best you can do is say well it's
credible so i'll follow it or not
um all right
so that's where i'm at at that i call
this a open story and by the way
i think that uh
people like brett weinstein um
are the essential part of
the government now literally
you know i've told you before that the
model of how we run america anyway
may be true in other countries but the
way america runs at the moment
is that somebody who knows what they're
talking about a citizen
comes up with a strong point of view and
then they find
influencers and the influencers boost
the message
until this one expert's message goes
wider
and then the critics can weigh in and
opinions are formed in social media
and if social media as a proxy for the
public
if it if it has a dominant opinion
that's like really strong in one
direction
i think the government almost always has
to go that way
because they like to get elected right
and if something is
70 30 in the public opinion
i think you get both you know democrats
and
republicans looking at it pretty
seriously so
when you look at this story whether it
turns out that
ivermectin is is a miracle or not you're
seeing the model of the future
you had the expert dr pierre corey very
very credible person
talking to a
to somebody who could you know
understand enough of the argument to
promote it
promote the argument then you have
people like me
who see that and then we can decide to
boost or not i decided to boost it in
this case
this is your government you're watching
the actual government function
it's just a bunch of people with an
expert
an influencer and then we mix it up and
then we tell our government what to do
basically now it's not going to work
every time but that's that's the model
we're in
all right
the reporting is that president trump
plans to make uh
dr fauci his his main target
when he runs for reelection presumably
now that is a really good strategy
i have not been uh the biggest
critic of dr fauci and i know that puts
me at odds with
most of you uh i've been the
easiest grader of all of our leaders
whether be they
experts or just elected officials in my
opinion
from from day one when we started the
pandemic i
i told you i'm going to be an easy
grader because we're guessing a lot of
people are going to be guessing
they're going to be updating their
opinions new information coming
so people being wrong is just going to
happen
and some of it's just guessing right and
you're giving credit to people who just
guessed right
i don't think you should take too much
credit or wait for people to guess wrong
if if they made a credible argument for
what they did
so i'm not anti fouchy like most of you
which is not to say he's been right
not to say that i would have done it the
same way or any that i just
don't want him to be my my personal
punching bag
because i just don't think it's good for
the country but
as a strategy president
trump's um biggest problem
in my opinion was that he was considered
anti-science
right wouldn't you say
well maybe one of the three biggest
problems
is that trump was considered
anti-science
if he can find a face
that he can call science and experts and
it looks like that face is going to be
fouchy's face
if he can put a picture to it like the
wall
the wall is visual right you can see the
wall in your head even if it's not built
so he loves a visual persuasion with a
with an object
so it's either crooked hillary is the
object uh look at crooked hillary
or build a wall do you see the wall or
are the dangerous criminals from
ms-13 are coming across the border i can
see that
i can see that criminal but how do you
beat the charge
that you're anti-science science doesn't
have a face
it's a concept it looks like trump has
solved
how to turn a concept into a face
um
uh i'm looking at your comment marusha
and yes i have looked at that
the israel map over time
and it is it is uh interesting
so uh trump has figured out a way to put
a face
on science and it's a face that enough
people in this country have a negative
opinion about because he's been bashed
for so long
and because we didn't like being in the
pandemic so we wanted somebody to blame
it's a really good strategy you could
argue the ethics of it
that's a separate question but would it
be persuasive
yup it's pretty darn good as a strategy
apparently the border folks
the u.s border officials have started
using a facial recognition
app to track the asylum seekers
do you remember me telling you that's
the way we should handle this
because i think we might be reaching a
point
and maybe we're already there that if
you could tell who people were once they
got in
if you had enough cameras and facial
recognition you could just
open the border you just let people in
if we knew who they were now i guess
we're it's not a perfect system yet
maybe a lot of the people coming across
the border
don't have a let's say a social media
presence
etc so it's not maybe fully as realized
as it could be
but um and wait before you before you
criticize let me
uh fill out the point here if i knew who
was in the country
and every time they say walked in front
of a public camera and said oh this
person's here
we could pick them up and send them home
if we wanted to if we knew that they
committed a crime
well that their face would probably be
on some other camera
and you look for those people and you
send them home
so when the the left
talks about reimagining um
police i'm actually very much on their
side
on the concept not the details you know
the details might be stupid
but the idea that you could use
technology
and start from scratch and just
reimagine
what you would do is pretty strong and
one of the assets that we have now that
we never had before
is smartphones everybody needs one
to be a functioning person in society
you know even the people who are illegal
and come across the border
they still need a smartphone what if
you could track everybody by their face
and you could just
block their cell phone or or basically
 their phone
unless they turn themselves in or
something like that
you know you you can imagine that you
could control people's actions
or catch people commit crimes so easily
that you could take all the incentive
and a crime you could get to the point
where they're all solved
how much crime do you have when they're
all solved
in theory it would only be crazy people
and you can't stop crazy people
everybody who is rational would know
that the moment they committed the crime
they're going to jail
so they just stopped doing it
so i do think i i do think it's not
crazy
to reimagine police without many police
with fewer of them i just don't know how
to do it but you can smell it before you
see it
and you can kind of smell that there's
something there but
maybe it gets you into a brave new world
and too much government control to make
any of that happen
so um trump of course has been blocked
i guess for two years he's got a two
year ban on facebook
so that would take it through the 2022
midterms which
is really a big deal because trump is an
influential voice and especially he
would be influential in the midterms
so he won't have facebook to do that
anymore and here's my question
what happens if it turns out trump was
right
because mostly he's being banned i think
because of talking about the election
integrity
we haven't heard anything that's real
smoking gun right
from the election audits i feel like we
would have we would know by now
i feel as if the audits are finding
nothing
because we would have heard something
the same way we heard about that
database that was missing
then it turned out it wasn't really
missing i feel like we'd know by now if
there was something there
and i don't think you have to count
every ballot to know if there's a
problem
so we should know by now and we don't so
i would guess
if i had to put money on it today
i would say that they won't have access
to what they need
to check everything so you'll never know
for sure
for example the audience won't have
access to the
the software that that's on the machines
probably
it's probably probably a bunch of
proprietary stuff that they can't get at
so i don't think that there's any way
physically or logically
or operationally to know if if the
elections were good
but we're probably not going to find
anything and but the question is this
what if he's right remember
you know trump was saying about the
wuhan lab leak
being a possibility probability i think
he said
and and he got you know he got a lot of
trouble for that
but what if he's right what if he's
right about
hydroxychloroquine i i'm i'm betting
against
it at this point but what if he is
somebody says that database was deleted
well i don't know if it was deleted but
it was recovered so
yeah it was easily recovered if they
knew what they were doing i guess
oh you're right i did have chocolate in
the corner of my mouth
thank you i ate a chocolate protein bar
before i got on here apparently it was
speared over my mouth
sorry you had to look at that i
appreciate that tip
um all right well we'll find out
if trump is right it turns out the
teachers unions
whose reputations have fallen off a
cliff since the pandemic
uh have found a new way to be hated so
the san francisco teachers union
for the first time a tcg teachers union
is going to back a cause
so usually the teachers unions are
pretty much about what's good for
the teachers according to them but now
they're going to back the cause so the
san francisco teachers union is
uh is uh backing the bds
movement boycott divestment and
sanctions against
israel so the teachers union in san
francisco
decided that their one cause that they
would ever join
so far is an anti-israel
boycott so
is that the end of the teachers unions
did did they just put their foot on the
third rail
because if i were the teachers unions
i would not be so confident that if i
went after
the jewish american public that that
would turn down
okay because that's sort of what's
happening here
i don't feel like this is going to work
out for them
um but wow
i mean talk about ways to destroy your
own reputation
well in a row in a weirdly related note
uh good news for the locals platform
most of you know i have a subscription
service on the
locals platform at locals
just you can just google me and locals
you'll find it
and joel has joined locals
you know joel from breitbart but what
you might not know is that
uh at least for quite a while at least
during the
through the trump administration uh i've
known joel
and i can get usually the the useful
background from him because you know we
chat often
and i'll hear i'll hear news from him at
least context
that i never heard anywhere else and you
know it's all true
right so if you want to know the real
context
of why things are going the way they are
in the news
he's the guy to follow so if you're
looking at locals and you want to
pick up a few more people to follow
highly recommended you'll be you'll get
to see behind the curtain
you know there are only a few people
that i recommend
can show you pull the curtain back and
show you what's back there
and he's one of them so follow joel on
locals
um how many of you treat
sleep as a skill
in other words how many of you look at
your sleeping habits and maybe you have
trouble sleeping
and how many of you are saying oh okay
sleep is a skill
i need to do this and this and this to
get my
skill working
oh i see a number of you do that
somebody says it's a hobby
jack um here's
some new research which falls into the
category of
blindingly obvious but it's nice to have
research to back it
which is that people who exercise
vigorously
have way fewer problems sleeping is
there anybody who didn't know that
were you aware that exercise is really
the very best way to make sure you get a
good night's sleep
how many of you knew that it feels like
it's obvious right
but apparently it's been proven by
science
and here's what i would like to say
about this you know i've
i've told you about the concept of
reframing
and reframing is one of these subtle
things where you can hear
a million examples and maybe still not
be able to do it yourself
because the the reframing does not
require
new information reframing is just
looking at the same information you were
looking at before
but just deciding to filter it
differently and to you know just
frame it differently here's how to frame
sleep
you do not have a problem sleeping
you do not have a problem getting to
sleep that's what you used to say
you used to say i have problems getting
to sleep that's the wrong frame
here's the right frame i didn't exercise
enough today
try that next time you can't get to
sleep
don't say to yourself damn it i have
trouble getting to sleep
no you don't you don't have trouble
getting to sleep
you have too little exercise you have an
exercise
problem and that exercise problem might
be extending into other
men other parts of your life you might
have trouble controlling your weight
you don't have an eating problem or you
might have an eating problem
but maybe you have an exercise problem
right weight is mostly about what you
eat
but exercises you know at least 10 of it
yeah you you have
you have an exercise problem just tell
yourself that
now the reason that reframing works is
that the
is that the message you tell yourself
becomes your operating code
you will make decisions based on the way
you frame things
so that's the connection between how you
think of it and how you act
reframing can make you act differently
so as soon as you say damn it i didn't
exercise enough tonight
that'll probably give you a better
chance of exercising tomorrow
so just reframe it as not enough
exercise and watch how that helps
in fox news they report that a fisherman
found uh 1.5 million dollars worth of
whale vomit in yemen
now um when i've been searching for
whale vomit
um i usually look locally and i find
none
really but yemen is a good place for it
if you go to yemen find yourself a dead
whale rip its stomach open
find a big old chunk of whale vomit
that's still in its stomach
and apparently it's a valuable commodity
for the fragrance industry
yeah they use it as a scent stabilizer
now how somebody found out that whale
vomit
is a scent stabilizer i don't know
how many things did they try before they
got to whale vomit
was it trial and error well we need a
scent
stabilizer for our fragrance what should
we try
water how about water water didn't work
let's try uh vodka about
milk about ivermectin
um but somebody probably a genius
in a moment of clarity unlike anything
we've ever
witnessed somehow realized that if you
cut a whale open
and you took its solidified vomit
that would make a hell of a scent
stabilizer
so the next time you see somebody who
has a
great fragrance and you say to yourself
what is that you're wearing oh i love i
love your fragrance
and they say oh it's blah blah blah you
say
ah and i love the scent stabilizer than
that
yeah i'm picking up a little note of
whale vomit
and you know that's that's the very best
wait
oh it's not just whale vomit is whale
vomit
from yemen it's the good stuff
so i don't know i have questions about
this whole
situation let's talk about putin
and his uh alleged hackers
so the the thought is that these
ransomware hackers
reside in russia putin of course says i
don't know anything about that
i don't know nothing about no no
hackers in my country but of course we
know that russia
typically employs criminals to do things
that they can
say they didn't do so how do you handle
this
is the way you handle it do you say
putin do something about those hackers
and then putin says i don't know who
they are
just criminals you know we don't even
know where they are
is that good enough doesn't feel like it
i feel as if the play is this hey putin
do you know where these hackers are no i
don't
okay but you know it's your problem
right
and putin says it's not my problem it's
your problem they didn't hack me
no you say no i don't think you're
hearing me
we're making it your problem because you
have a chance of solving this but we
don't
now the fact that you don't want to is
not
our problem the fact that
you say you didn't have any involvement
in it again
that would be your problem that's not
our problem
our problem is that we got hacked
your problem is that we're making it
your problem
your problem is if you don't find some
way to find these people
and we're not saying you know where they
are but
it's your problem is it hard to find
them well that's too bad for you because
the consequences will be extreme
but don't confuse your problem
putin with our problem our problem is we
got hacked
your problem is that we just made that
your problem because we can't solve it
you can it's your problem now so
i don't know that there's any other way
to get there from here right
you got to make it his problem and you
got to make his stick
same with fentanyl as i'm saying in the
comments right
you got to go to china and say fentanyl
was our problem but now it's yours
and we're just gonna make it a bigger
and bigger problem until you figure it
out
do what you want to do you could you
could jail your uh
dealers or not but it's your
problem now
because we're making it your
problem and
i think we have to keep that as standard
because this
well we're not doing it i don't know it
might have been a fentanyl dealer but
ah it's not us no it's not good enough
anymore
now it's your problem that
should be
in fact if uh if uh trump gets reelected
in 2024
that should be the slogan instead of
make america great again
it should be i'm gonna make this your
 problem
and then make it their problem
that's a pretty good standard
have i ever told you that you should
never argue by analogies
i believe i have here's an example of
why you should not use
analogies to make your point a federal
judge
has reversed the california ban on
ar-15s so apparently sometime soon maybe
maybe already i'm not sure how fast this
goes into action
you'll be able to buy an ar-15 in
california
in the federal judge's ruling
he made an analogy and he said the ar-15
is like a swiss army knife in the sense
that
a swiss army knife could be used for a
variety of things
and a ar-15 could be used for hunting
could be used for defending the homeland
could be used for defending your house
so the analogy is that a swiss army
knife can be used for many things
and an ar-15 can also be used for many
things
that's the analogy that's what the
federal judge said
how did the news interpret that
perfectly reasonable statement hey it's
a tool that could be used for many
different purposes
how was that interpreted it was
interpreted by the fake news
as a swiss army knife was compared to an
ar-15
as if they are equally deadly
nothing like that happened the analogy
was about multiple usefulness of its
you know features the news turned it
into
uh i might have to run here
gotta run that's the end for today i'll
see
