all right here's the problem i select
the line tool
here are my settings
and then i use the line tool
and every line i draw makes the prior
line go away
and if i deselect it it just disappears
now going back here
if i reselect
and make sure that i've selected the
line
and i've selected the fill make sure
i've got a black there
and then these these numbers have filled
in
automatically i don't know where the 12
and the 132 came from
but now when i draw it's a big thick
line
that i did not request so things are
happening somewhat
randomly and this is with the latest
update i just
downloaded the update
any any hints
