hey everybody
come on in come on it's time
time for the best part of the day and
i'm gonna guarantee you
that this coffee with scott adams will
be the best one
of the entire morning
that's right there will be no better
coffee with scott adams all day long and
i can guarantee that this is going to be
good it's going to be rocking
and all you need is a copper margaret
glass i think our telescope steiner
canteen tiger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee if you didn't know
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine
end of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's gonna happen now go
oh my god the waves of pleasure that are
just
rippling over my body right now can you
feel it
it's probably happening to you too
goosebumps a little bit
no all right
well finally there's something fun to
talk about in the news
and what did it take was it because
biden slipped on some stairs going up
the steps to air force one
is that what makes it so fun that an
elderly person fell down
no there's nothing funny about an
elderly person falling down
unless it has a connection to a trump
story
which it did therefore it's turbocharged
it's regular news but it's amped up a
few levels because you can make a
make a trump reference to it you can
make trump
memes if you haven't yet seen the meme
of trump hitting a golf ball the hits
looks like he hits biden in the head
before he falls on the stairs
and then he hits the second golf ball to
knock him down the second time
if you haven't seen that meme go look
for it
go look for it because if you don't
laugh
both times when that golf ball hits
biden and that meme
you're dead inside you're dead inside
so go take a look at that now of course
the
the whole country is feeling pretty darn
good about their president biden
not only did he get mocked by north
korea
china and russia and basically
embarrassed the country but he walks up
the stairs and falls
on his face three times two two or three
times i guess
and the worst part is
that it comes so soon after failing
in public you know with the talks with
china where china basically
slapped the american team down and
could this look worse i don't see how
this could look worse
now let's compare how the news treated
biden's little slip with uh trump's
little walk down the ramp because the
news has a lot of
articles on this
so here's how the new york times
referred to biden slip on the stairs
quote
biden was quote doing 100 fine after his
fall
and exited later without an issue
well there you go is just a a little
slip there's nothing to see here
that's exactly how they treated it when
president trump had his little
ramp issue right well you be the judge
here's what they said about that
the new york times said of trump's
trump's
halting walk down ramp raises new health
questions
the president also appeared to have
trouble raising a glass of water to his
mouth
during his speech he turned 75 the
the oldest the president has been in his
first term
now first of all who is it like when did
he become a stat
to say the oldest person in their first
term
wouldn't it be more relevant to say he
was or was not the oldest
president because that would mean
something
but the oldest president in his first
term
it's like they had to reach a little bit
to make him older
how can we make him a little bit older
well we'll go
we'll just limit it to the first term
therefore he's the oldest one
when you see this level of
media bias which you know we see every
day
but every time you see one that's this
extreme you say to yourself
wait a minute are they even trying to
hide it anymore
they're not trying to hide it right this
is just
what it is more on that
now what do you make of the fact that
north korea and china especially can
uh play up american racism
and make themselves invulnerable from
moral attack
did trump ever fall into that trap
i don't remember trump falling into the
trap of
telling them how to run their internal
affairs because we're doing so well over
here
i feel like trump just didn't make that
mistake
and biden walked right into it and
here's the thing
how could he not see that coming
if he's attacking the united states
every day for being a racist country
and then he goes to china and he says
hey whereas people do hey
you're being racist with the uyghurs and
and whatnot
there's no moral accountability there or
no moral authority
how did he not see that how is it not
obvious that the existence of black
lives matter
especially the you know the media talk
about the anti-asian
violence etc how did he not know he was
walking right into a buzz saw
well what is a pattern
what is a pattern that we see with
democrats
and republicans i say it all the time
it's always the same
the republicans seem to recognize human
motivation
and make predictions based on the fact
that humans always act like humans
we're motivated by the same things it's
very predictable
democrats act as though human motivation
isn't a thing so the most reasonable
prediction you could have made
is that china would say uh looks like
you got your own problems because you do
it's the most it's the most obvious
thing you'd expect didn't see it coming
all right um speaking of the media
and speaking of the uh all of the
violence against asian americans which
we hear is spiking
here's what's surprising and i only know
this is true because i watch the news
if you don't watch the news you might
not know this you would be uninformed
but i watched the news and so this is
what i know
that maybe you haven't noticed it's kind
of weird so we've got this spike in
asian american violence
which is horrific and we we all condemn
right we don't need to say any extra
about that everybody's on the same
same side of that we need that to be
zero
and anything anything less than zero is
indefensible but
um here's here's the weird part
that's predictable right it's kind of
predictable
that if you're talking about the you
know the the china virus that some
people who are not so smart
are going to generalize that to asian
americans living in this country who may
not even have any china
connection you know ethnically
culturally or any other way
so it's kind of predictable
but you know what else was predictable
that didn't happen
so it makes you question your predicting
ability right
if if i told you that there was going to
be a big black lives
matter movement and there would be
regular protests and stuff
and there would be much more attention
on the
the let's say the uh i know tensions
between the black and white community in
the united states
wouldn't you expect an uptick in
anti-white crime and violence
wouldn't you wouldn't the most logical
uh thing you could predict from the
black lives movement
black lives matter movement is that some
people again not the reasonable people
but some people would say oh well we're
demonizing white people now
so have a little more violence against
white people
but the amazing thing is there's no
uptick whatsoever
in black on white crime
it's amazing isn't it you would
certainly expect that to be true
given the setup because it's it's a
different setup from the asian american
situation
but in the same sense just because when
things are in the news
when things are in the news it causes
people to react and overreact to it
right
so just putting black lives matter in
the news
my my brain says you would have expected
an uptick in violence
and yet there is none and the only
reason i know there is none because it's
not reported
if if that were happening
it would be reported right
wouldn't it you don't think they would
just ignore it
do you huh
because if they were going to ignore it
that would make you seem as though
the news isn't really real i have
trouble believing that
i mean don't make me start thinking that
the news is
just made up i don't want to think
that so we'll just assume that this is
true because it's not being reported
and as you know that's the way it works
when the news doesn't report something
that means it didn't happen
we'll see another example of that in a
minute
here's a question for you now this
science has shown that
extreme partisanship can cause brain
damage
i talked about this earlier so they've
done mris on brains and they can
actually show
that if you consume only partisan news
in another news another word for that
would be fake news
because the fake news tends to be
partisan i mean it's not exactly the
same
same concept but it overlaps so much
that for all practical purposes
partisan news and fake news become about
the same thing
not 100 but if fake news
causes brain damage because partisanship
does
you would it would be obvious that fake
news would too
um shouldn't it be regulated
shouldn't the fda regulate a thing which
can be administered to human beings
and has a profound effect on their
health
just pause to let you think about that
so we know now
because science and don't you love
science
is there anybody here who loves science
more than i do i doubt it
watch me hug it i love you science
i don't know what the democrats are
saying they don't think i love you
but i do i love you science
so that's how much i love science
however much you love science
it's a mere vibration of how much i love
science
i would science i would and science
is not even good looking
but i would it i'd it hard
you might only date it for you science
is probably a platonic thing
and i don't begrudge that i'm just
saying that your
love of science is nowhere near mine
mine is a fully fulfilled
physical emotional and spiritual
connection
um so that's just me but for a lot of
you
you're um as i was saying you're lost in
the fake
news and it's causing brain damage and
should the fda
not regulate cnn
seriously all right so so i've been
i've been kidding a lot right been doing
a lot of
sarcasm here but i'm going to turn the
sarcasm mode
off because this is a real point
if fake news causes brain damage and we
know that
because the science shows it can be
confirmed just look at the mri
why wouldn't the fda regulate it
because it is it is a thing which is
created by people
that is administered to humans
affects their health
what would be the logic for not
regulating it now there might not be a
practical way to do it
but shouldn't you talk about it
shouldn't the fda
wait it gets better let's say it's
impractical
to ban fake news maybe they want to
but it's just impractical because
somebody would have to decide
what's the real news and what's the fake
news and then you just push the problem
up one level
right if you don't trust the news why
would you trust the person who tells you
what news is true and what isn't
it's just another person not to trust
right so
maybe we should treat it like cigarettes
maybe cnn should run a warning
before every show that says
consuming partisan news from
this network has been shown by science
to cause brain damage to protect
yourself
diversify your sources of not of news
right now the fda
is in the business of protecting our
health
am i wrong they're in the business of
following science
and protecting our health now i would
agree it's probably completely
impractical to ban any kind of news
source
you know because you're the fda that
that wouldn't fly
but warning labels fly you know there
was a big fight over putting
uh explicit language warning uh
warning labels on music back in the tip
or gore days of long ago
it was thought hey if you label the
music it's sort of censorship
and you're you would be putting those
artists at a disadvantage if you said
there's naughty stuff on this album
it was a lot of argument about it but in
the end i think the argument that made
the
most sense is that why shouldn't you be
required
to accurately label your product and if
people
care about the profanity in the music
and people do care
you know it's something that's on the
top of their list of things they care
about parents mostly
why wouldn't you label it it's perfectly
fair to label something that
might have a problem just label it
who exactly complains about more
information about a product
right if you add more information about
cnn
is that bad under in what world is
having more information bad
and if the more information is that it
would be dangerous to your brain
to consume just cnn and nothing else and
we know that to be true and by the way
same thing for fox news you know i pick
on cnn because
it's just a universal reference but you
know fox news no different
should also be labeled
partisan news will damage your brain
make sure you diversify your sources
and it would be hilarious for a
a public movement to start like tim
gore it was came from the public it
didn't come from the government
um to get a warning label on cnn
it would it would of course have to be
on the other networks but it would be
funnier if you just
did it that way well maria pardoroma
sort of broke some news with
interviewing former dni
uh john ratcliffe they were talking
about ufos
and they said uh apparently they have a
number of sensors for picking up what's
flying around
he didn't say what he meant by sensors
but i assume radar
satellites the usual stuff
and he said they're picking up a lot of
ufos
doesn't mean aliens just means
unidentified
and that these objects are doing things
which
defy what we know about current
technology
so it seems to defy physics but at the
very least
it seems to be beyond what human
technology is
that we know of so
what do you make of that apparently
there's some report coming out soon
about what the government does or does
not know we should not expect them to
tell the truth
because it's not the government's job to
tell us the truth
we kind of pay them not to right
part of what value you get from your
government is that sometimes
sometimes they need to lie to you for
your own good
and if we did have advanced ufo alien
technology that we were trying to
commercialize
it would be better if you didn't know
that i think you'd be better if you
didn't know
so i wouldn't mind if the government
lied to us
about anything that has security
ramifications but here's
but let's use this as an example of how
to
filter the truth okay someday
we might actually know the answer
but now we don't so let's let's use our
tools that we've developed
to look at this situation and see if we
can
predict where this will turn out okay
so we'll use different filters and
different
different framing to predict this
number one what are the odds that with
so many
sightings that it would not be a genuine
non-earth phenomenon
could you take the fact that there are
many sensors that have picked up things
that
we don't seem to be able to do in this
world and there are lots of reports
some of them are eyewitness a lot of
eyewitness reports
so how do you what kind of credibility
would you put on
lots and lots of reports
well it would depend how clear the
reports are right
if somebody had a clear photograph of a
ship we'd never seen before
that would be pretty convincing but
what do we know about bigfoot and the
loch ness monster
one thing we know about bigfoot and the
loch ness monster is
it's really hard to get a clean
photograph
because they're not real
things that are real are relatively
easier to photograph
now it's not a 100 correlation but it's
pretty good
and with so many things why do we only
have
unclear photos of something that looks
like a blotch or a
or a glowing cigar
but it's never like a a good photograph
right we never get that good photograph
so i would say to you that the lack of a
good photograph
after so many decades of trying to get
one
probably is a pretty strong indication
that there are no flying saucers
all right so this so now i'm giving you
my opinion
based on this filter the filter that we
haven't
we haven't gotten a photograph yet
really that tells me it's not real
now what are the other possibilities
are you ready here are the other
possibilities number one
uh we just can't get a good photo
because they're fast
maybe that's the whole story they're
just fast can't get a photo
what if it's the u.s technology that we
just don't want other people know
that we have or some other country's
technology it could be
maybe some country maybe the u.s has
some technology
but it seems to violate physics
i don't think that the united states or
china
or any advanced country if i had to
guess and i do
i don't think anybody has anything that
violates physics
so i'm going to say that that alone
eliminates
even alien technology because we don't
think alien technology is going to
violate physics
right you know even if it were different
where they came from
physics or physics when you get here
they violate the law of physics once
they get to our planet
i mean maybe could be something we don't
know about reality
but i'm going to give you my more
controversial theory which you've never
heard before
are you ready for the best theory about
ufo sightings
you have ever seen have you ever heard
me mention that we might be living in a
simulation
and that the simulation hypothesis that
we're just sort of some
software construct by some other entity
that was smart enough to do it some
point
in the past if you buy into that theory
that we're a simulation
there is a very shocking uh
part of this which is that we would be
built
under a theory of resource constraint
in other words if you were going to sit
down and build a simulated world
just in today's technology would you
build the world
to use only 10 of the capacity of your
computer
probably not right because if you're
going to build a simulation
in order to make it as realistic and
complicated and rich as you wanted it to
be
you'd probably use something closer to
as much of the capacity of the computer
or whatever you're working on as you
could
would you say that first of all that's a
reasonable assumption that whatever
resources
would be used if we were a simulation
they would use most of it because you
always do
you're always going to use most of it
because you need it all now
suppose they used up most of their
computing sources creating
earth that's reasonable
earth's pretty complicated right i also
believe
that if we are simulated our history is
created on demand
it doesn't exist until you need it in
other words
whatever is under the ground in your
backyard if nobody's ever dug a hole
there doesn't need to be anything there
until you dig the hole
the simulation isn't going to waste a
lot of time
filling in all the details at the center
of the earth
if nobody's ever going to go there it'll
never be observed
so as you observe it or measure it it
becomes real
and then it has to fill in enough
details to be compatible with other
histories
and when it's not compatible or the
simulation can't make it compatible
it gives one of you a false memory and
says you remembered it wrong
[Laughter]
so that's how you get all these
different histories that don't match
you just say well i guess that other
person remembered it wrong
and you just go on with your life but we
have actually
uh maybe infinite or lots of them
histories that don't even match each
other
so that would be the simulation that's
how you would build it now
if the simulation had tapped out
just to make earth but it was also
designed to expand over time
and let's say the person who built the
simulation
got a got a better job and increased the
number of cpus or
processors and over time could build
another earth once they had enough
processing power
what would it look like before you could
add the detail
it would look like this it would look
like a spaceship
that you couldn't get a good read on
that everybody would look at it and they
wouldn't see it clearly
because the moment we see it clearly the
simulation has to build a history
and to build a history that would
support an alien spacecraft
requires building a whole planet a whole
civilization
it's way too big for the simulation so
instead
while the simulation doesn't have enough
computing power we'll see indications of
this future
but it's not until we get the first
picture
that the uh past will be created by the
simulation
and that's when that alien planet
will become real and that at the moment
there is no alien life
but there will be and when there will be
it doesn't mean that we evolve
you know until there is it means it
becomes
completely real at one moment in time
that hasn't happened yet so the history
of the alien planets
is yet to be written and maybe it
depends on the amount of resources
running the simulation
and until those resources become enough
every ufo sighting will be just a blotch
because we'll never be able to to see it
in a way that we all see it and then
hardened its existence in the past
yeah you didn't see that coming did you
all right throw that in your your list
um or or as somebody says
scientology was right i guess that's the
other possibility
uh i'm gonna bet against their currently
being any uh
alien planets or ufos i am also going to
bet
that they do exist in the future but
that they don't exist yet
because we're a simulation all right uh
there's a lot of talk about
uh killing the filibuster now this is
one of those boring little wonky stories
that
it's easy to ignore but it feels like
that's the whole game doesn't it
that whoever can kill the filibuster
while they're in power
they're going to have way too much power
and what are the two ways
that that could go well one is that
let's say democrats get rid of the
filibuster
and that allows them to pass things by a
simple majority
instead of needing sixty percent for
some kinds of things
and that would make the republicans just
completely useless because the democrats
have majority they would just vote what
they wanted
it wouldn't matter how much republicans
complain because there's nothing they
could do about it
so would that lead to a one-party uh
i don't know dictator eventually
maybe maybe but the other possibility
is that the voters would just say uh
you've gone too far
and then just vote a bunch of
republicans into office
so i feel like it's self-correcting
which i think is the genius of our
current system
we have all kinds of problems all the
time with our current system
but it seems kind of self-correcting
doesn't it and i feel like that's what
china has to be afraid of
because china's got a lot of advantages
of size and
being a dictatorship gives them some
advantages but they don't have what we
have
the ability just to just recreate
ourselves on the fly
and that's very powerful i would bet on
that
so
um i feel is this as if there are some
stories in
in politics that really show what's
wrong with biden
meaning that it doesn't look like he's
in charge
now of course we're looking for that
because we think it's going to be true
so we're going to look for evidence to
make ourselves look smart but with this
latest thing where the white house
is firing staffers who admit who
apparently had
used pot in the past marijuana
that doesn't feel like a biden in charge
does it
do you feel as if a uh a
lucid president if you sat down with him
and said hey
we're going to fire a whole bunch of our
staffers that we liked
and we want to work here but we're going
to fire them over
past pot use do you think that joe biden
would say
yeah yeah we should get rid of our staff
that we did so much work
to to attract and we want to keep them
because they
they used pot in the past do you think
he said that
do you think that conversation happened
i don't think so i feel as if this story
is this gigantic red flag that says
nobody even talked to biden about this
right it looks like he wasn't even
involved and the reason i say that is
that
this looks like no human was involved
because you know what a human
would do not this
not this let's let's throw a dart at a
human
let's see uh alright got my dirt
sorry sorry i i hit a human with a dart
i just sorry i was just picking you
randomly with the dart
just gonna you know ask this question
do you think the white house should fire
people that it really wants to work
there
because they've used pot in the past
which by the way is legal
in washington dc where they work so you
think that's a good idea
person i hit with the dart no no you
don't think so
and you're not even a fan of marijuana
but even you don't think that's a good
idea right
anybody you could hit
with a dart would say this was a bad
idea
republicans democrats independents
this this has the look
of a non-human decision and what i mean
by that
is there were some rules in place and
the humans just followed them
they didn't use any human judgment
because i think the the rules say that
if you broke a federal law you can't get
you know you can't get a i know
clearance or something
so i think they're just following some
technical law but there doesn't seem to
be
any chance in the world that the
president
knew about this because there's nobody
who could know about this and would have
agreed with it
he would have just issued an executive
order to redefine
to basically that's what executive
orders are good at
to just put clarification on existing
law
he can clarify it any way he wants and
he could just clarify it away
and then we have this extra problem that
kamal harris admitted
her marijuana use in the past
you kind of have to ask her to leave
or you don't ask the other people to
leave
again no human being would have made
this decision
oh yeah let's fire all the people who
are not kamal harris
for doing all the things that kamal
harris admits she does
or did no human would make that decision
this is a leaderless decision
you get that right there's no leader
that was involved in this
and yet it goes on and now it's been 24
hours or whatever it's been
and if biden had any awareness of what
was going on with this issue
i feel like he would change it right we
would already see a statement saying
oh i didn't realize this was happening
the rule says we have to do this but i'm
going to look at the rule
yeah we're going to re-examine that rule
that would have happened already
if he were anything in charge
so i don't think that we need to get rid
of kamal harris for smoking upon the
past
but we have to answer the question who's
in charge
because it doesn't look like anybody
so there was a federal judge who just
issued a minority opinion and it doesn't
matter what case it was
because the case he was working on is
not relevant to the story
but this is a federal judge someone
whose job it is to be objective
and i want to read the entire um
minority
statement and it's judged lawrence
silverman and he
and the the headline is he called new
york times washington post
virtually democratic party broadsheets
basically working for the party
he says quote although the bias against
the republican party not just
controversial individuals is rather
shocking today
this is not new there's a long-term
secular trend
going back to the 70s silverman wrote
then he said two of the three most
influential papers at least historically
new york times washington post and
virtual and are virtually
democratic party broadsheets
and
hello
hello yes hello
hi this is um smith here speaking from
the medicare head office
how are you doing today i'm doing great
how are you
you're from the medicare head office
you excuse me hello
what kind of spam call is that do you
know what
do you know what tipped him off i was
too happy to talk to him
[Laughter]
as soon as i hear you're happy to talk
to them they're like this isn't good
i don't like where this is going all
right what was i saying so this federal
judge is basically
saying that the the the newspapers are
now just
a unit of the democratic party is a
democratic party trumpet
and he lists some other entities that
are saying this is
this is fairly important i think because
for a federal
judge to come down this hard on
the news business it feels like that's
something's happening now i keep telling
you that the democrats are
uh eating their own and a good example
is uh
bill maher i don't know if he'd call
himself a democrat but he calls himself
a liberal a classic liberal
and uh he's really going hard
at the the woke group and it's just fun
to watch
so uh and here's a quote from his show
last night
and i think it also tells you something
that whatever bill maher does on his
show
becomes news the next day how often have
you seen this
bill maher does a show and then that's
the news
that's the news the next day so good job
bill maher i mean
of being relevant and he said this quote
people go to parties now and they don't
want to talk
they're like can i talk i don't know
your girlfriend
she might she might be woke he says
really i'm not making this up and i
believe him
i believe that that's actually something
that people worry about
i don't know if i could talk to you
because i don't i don't know your
girlfriend she might
she might be too woke um
so he's going pretty hard at that uh you
know
the awokeness stuff and that's good to
see
uh speaking of the fake news um
well yeah so there's a uk recovery trial
so a big
randomized i think trial in which they
were looking at
i guess they looked at 39 000 covid
patients
and they tried they looked at them with
a bunch of different
therapeutics so not vaccines they're
just looking at therapeutics
and they studied a bunch of them and i
read the headline and it said
so just from the headline it looked like
dexamethasone
is works it reduced i know death or
hospitalization by third
so dexamethasone looked really good
and there was one other thing
anti-illegal six or something
so another one looked pretty good and
but the headline said that the
the ones that were not included and did
not make a difference included
hydroxychloroquine
so 39 000 people studied
and no effect absolutely no effect
of people who were hospitalized
no benefit from hydroxychloroquine
i'll wait for about 10 seconds for
somebody in the comments
to tell me what's wrong with this story
now they didn't
i didn't see in the story that they were
testing i've ivormectin so i don't know
about that one
okay what's wrong with the story well
there you go it didn't take you long
right somebody in the comments already
is on it
i don't know how many times i have to
say this
the claim for hydroxychloroquine
is that it works if you get it really
early
like when the first symptoms come on now
i'm not saying that's true
i don't want to be kicked off of social
media i'm saying that other people's
claim
was that it works if you get really
early
they also claim that they don't have any
reason to believe it would work
once you're already hospitalized
what do they test every time they test
hydroxychloroquine
they only test it the way nobody thinks
it works
nobody's claiming nobody
no scientist i don't believe anybody has
claimed it works once you're
hospitalized
the only claim was that it might have an
effect
if you get it really early that's the
only claim
and every time i see these
test it wrong
i just say to myself is this happening
right in front of me
are you really only testing the
thing that nobody thinks works
that's it you didn't think once
to test the thing that might work
now i'm not saying it works my my guess
is it doesn't
if i had to give you my personal opinion
of hydroxychloroquine
it doesn't work that would be my guess
because it's been so long without it
being confirmed
i feel it would have been confirmed by
now so i've been telling you all along i
started with a reasonable percentage
that you know it's worth the
risk because it's so low cost
but i've said from the beginning that
every month it went by without
confirming it worked
you should reduce your your confidence
that it might
and i'd reduced it you know all the way
to 20 and less
and now if it turns out that it doesn't
work at all
even if you gave it to people in the
right time
i don't know so here's the thing
as mad as i am that this has not been
tested in the way that
people claim it might work i don't know
if that's
reasonable because i don't know any
country
that's giving anybody anything just
because they might have some symptoms
do you is any is any country
routinely prescribing something to
somebody who just has a cough
you know they're 25 years old and
they've got a little coveted cough and
they test positive
i think they just send them home don't
they
uh somebody said india but i'll bet you
they only give it to him in the hospital
because well um sony says africa i don't
think so
i think in africa they may be taking it
for malaria
and just have it in their system now i
don't think
i think the the stories about india are
not true
and i believe it's the same reason i
don't think that they give it in india
just because you had a cough i'll bet
not i'll bet against it but i don't know
for sure
all right so here we're supposed to
trust and love science
but science of course is only reported
to us by journalists
and journalists do stuff like this they
say
yeah hydroclock hydroxychloroquine
doesn't work
and then they don't show you that they
didn't really even test it
it doesn't work but we didn't test it um
football player desean watson
faces uh let's see 22 women
are accusing him of sexual
uh what sexual allegations i guess
22 and i think most of them are massage
parlor
employees so what did i tell you when uh
uh governor cuomo got got up to like his
second
accusation and i said it never stops at
two
it never stops at two sometimes an
accusation will stop
at one and those you have to wonder if
they're true
you know it's a little less credible
only one person accuses you
but when you get to two the odds of a
third one coming out
like it just goes off the chart right
you're going to get a third one
and when i saw this story first there
was there was one accuser
the other day against watson i said to
myself
if there's two there might be a lot
22 so far now you really want to
be sickened that's 22
came forward
that's 22 came forward how many were
there
because they don't all come forward
how many people do this p this guy rape
rape or sexually whatever whatever the
term is for what he did
ah this guy is like the biggest monster
in the world if these things are true
but he's innocent until proven guilty
let me not be a jerk for a moment and
respect the system
the system says that
uh duchenne watson is innocent until
proven guilty
i'm going to stick with that you know we
all have a human intuition that
this is way too much smoke to have no
fire but on the other hand
he's innocent until proven guilty all
right uh the
the guy who shot up the massage parlor
in atlanta
said he had a sexual addiction now
there's some talk about whether it's
even real
and i've always wondered that too it's
like where's the line between
somebody who's just really really likes
it
and somebody's got an addiction and some
smart people have some lines that they
can draw there but
uh bill maher had a statistic i don't
know where he where he got it from but
on last night's show
he said that a poll shows that single
people
on average let's say pleasured
themselves
three times a day during the pandemic
so three times a day the average single
person
did a little uh solo love making
and i said to myself he didn't specify
men
and so somebody says no way
and and so i ask you this if the average
was three times a day but that included
men
and women
i would think that the men were maybe
bringing the average up and the women
maybe were bringing it down
and so what was the average the actual
average just for men
and then what was the average for men
under
50 right because you're also throwing in
the average men who are 80 years old
i've got a feeling that the men under 40
weren't doing anything else
what else was there to do i think i'll
go to a rest
no well i think i'll go to the gym
now well i could go to a move
no i could go see my friend
no well i could go uh
i can't travel what
uh what's left
um what's left
so if you ask me three times a day
sounds a little bit
low but that's just me um
two stories that rasmussen was tweeting
about today the rasmussen pole people
um i don't know if you knew this but two
separate stories that are
kind of connected so in arizona the
court approved a state legislature
directed a full forensic audit
so this is for the 2020 election so the
election's over
but the arizona court now here's the
important point
it was a court that approved a full
audit secondly
in georgia there was a court
supervised fulton county full
physical ballot audit which they don't
have a result yet
but it's happening now here's the part
i'm confused about
see if you can explain this to me
because on one hand the courts have
found
no fraud significant widespread fraud
in the 2020 election do we all agree on
that that's just the fact right
the courts the courts
have found no proof
none no proof of widespread
election fraud we're all agreed on that
right that's just the fact
and the democrats have explained to me
that that means it doesn't exist and
that that's just logic
no courts have found widespread fraud
then logic says doesn't exist
we've been hearing this on on all the
news and social media for months right
did i get that wrong that if the courts
couldn't find any therefore logically
it doesn't exist but now here's the
confusing part the courts
in both arizona and georgia
have allowed audits
to audit something that
can't exist so why would you
approve looking for something
that logic says can't exist
are they just humoring the people say
well you have a right to do it
we know it's not there but go ahead and
look
anyway i'm just being a jerk um
my prediction as i've told you is that
the election outcome won't change but
history history will have a different
take on this election
and what's happening now is probably
part of a small part of
figuring out what that history is going
to look like
another hoax alert there's always a hoax
alert
do you remember the the alleged racist
cop
who excused the atlanta spa shooter by
saying that he had quote a really bad
day
well that's a racist isn't he cause
he's minimizing a murder of a bunch of
asian
asian or asian american folks so
very racist that was the news all day
but it turns out that all he was doing
was trying to characterize
the shooter's own opinion it wasn't his
opinion
he was describing somebody else's
opinion accurately as it turns out
so fake news all right i want to i want
to end of this you know you know how
when you were a kid maybe you're still a
kid there was always some
grandpa or grandma who was telling you
how hard things were back in their day
back in my day and i i tweeted out
something that's true
so the following statements are true and
it's just one of those uh
snapshots and time of how things were in
my life
so these are true statements i've been
robbed at gunpoint three times
and once by knife i've been in two car
crashes and one motorcycle accident
and i've escaped from three burning
buildings
and i'm still here now i also
cured a few incurable diseases along the
way
there was a lot to happen so far but if
you were to do
if you were to do a similar tweet would
it look that bad
let me explain some of them i was a bank
teller so two of the robberies were
when i was working as a bank teller you
know they they come up and stick the gun
at you and take your money
one happened in a parking lot in san
francisco at night
another one happened on marcus street in
san francisco at night that was the guy
with the knife
i've been in two car crashes but i
didn't get hurt either one
i've been in one pretty bad motorcycle
accident where i was
thrown a pretty large distance off my
motorcycle
landed landed i stuck the landing
basically
i got really lucky i'll tell you about
that
it was a dirt bike when i was a teenager
i was going across the field my front
tire
hit a gopher hole so if you're going
fast
and your front tire just stops your
motorcycle flips up in the air
you take a ride and as i was
flying through the air and i was
flipping around
in the air and i said to myself you know
this field i'm going to land in
has fairly large rocks
all over it's like a field with a lot of
rocks
and i'm in the air and i'm going to come
down
in this rock field i'm going to be kind
of dead
and i'm having these thoughts as i'm in
the air i'm going to be dead in about
a boom landed flat on my back
rocks all around me
didn't touch a single rock
landed flat in my back with a helmet i
had a helmet on so
i was fine now he shook me up the
motorcycle was
toast and was never the same but i lived
and i look at all these you know various
you know bicycle accidents and various
things that have happened to me
and it really makes you wonder
about the role of luck doesn't it
it really makes you wonder about luck
because so many people whose
lives didn't work out well had one of
these incidents and it didn't go right
right i have a friend who died
parachuting
right and things don't go right
so it does make me wonder about the the
nature of our existence
why is it that i got so lucky
and then somebody says so why are you
lying so much
do you think any of this is made up why
would i make these things up
these would be weird things to make up
um
and i was wondering if other people have
lives like that one of the questions
that people asked me was
uh to teach them how to tell the story
and i'm gonna do that to you right now
how many of you would like to
be better at telling a story when you
like to be that person who can
get people's attention and everybody's
looking at you and you tell that story
or even just talking to a friend
and i'm gonna give you the trick and
goes like this
you have to tell the story to yourself
in your head
a lot of times before the first time you
tell it to anyone else
okay so your story should have some
curiosity in the beginning
so when i told you my story about a
motorcycle accident
and then you started hearing it
developing weren't you curious
so i tried to give you a little
curiosity about how it turns out
so that's a good story starts with
something that
sparks your curiosity then there's the
body of the story which is just what
happened
if you want to be a good storyteller
tell it fast
don't do this and then there was a bob
it was bob it was tuesday
and uh no it wasn't bob it was uh it was
larry it was wednesday
anyway it doesn't really matter when it
was so that's the way most people tell
stories
the only way to avoid what i just did is
to
prepare your story in your head in
advance
now i do this automatically because i'm
a writer but i've kind of always done it
i always think how would i tell this as
a story what would be the opening
sentence
what would be the sequence of events and
then i tell it in my head in words
until i can repeat it down loud and it's
just repeating what was in my head
and then you have to have some kind of a
big ending
like a close a punch line something
that's amazing or something that's
humorous
if it doesn't have a good ending why are
you telling the story
right why make us wait till the end if
there's no ending
so you got to have a curiosity a really
rapid
pace only because you practiced it
and then a good twist or a punchline or
something at the end
you do those things keep it tight keep
it short
you'll be a good storyteller that's it
that's all you need but
but preparing it in your head before you
tell it the first time is the big trick
so you get that and you'll be in good
shape all right that's all i need for
now
uh and we will talk to you
tomorrow bye for now
all right youtubers luck comes from the
simulation it sure feels like it doesn't
it
what is your opinion on psychedelic
therapy for gender dysphoria
well i've never heard that used per se
but psychedelic treatments i think
are going to be one of the biggest
things in the next few years
so there are some things that just
living in california i get to see first
you know it's like living in the future
compared to the rest of the world
and let me say with certainty
psychedelics will be huge
in mental health treatment huge
um and it will be maybe one of the
biggest things
in civilization that's how big it is
because it will change how you think
there's nothing bigger than that and it
will work almost every time
not you know there will be exceptions of
course some people probably die from it
it's like everything else
but to your specific question about
gender dysphoria if
if that means what i think it is which
is somebody who thinks they're trapped
in the wrong body
you could imagine that psychedelics
would allow you to
be comfortable with your situation as it
is
i can imagine that i don't know that to
be true and i wouldn't even say it's
likely
but i can imagine it yeah and you know
what i've said with uh
the gender dysphoria is that there's an
assumption that if you feel trapped in
the wrong body
that the uh the best cause of action
would be to try to
fix that by altering the body
but i don't know that we have evidence
that that works
so i don't know that we have evidence
that the person's mental state
their general happiness is going to be
necessarily better after a transition
but we do live in a free country and
people do get to make those decisions
themselves and it's not up to me
to tell you what will make you happy
um but you're you're also
accepting that the gender dysphoria is
a a mental problem versus just
people are different at what point does
people are different become a mental
problem
so i you know the the way you set up the
question is uh that transgenders would
have a mental problem
it's the way you ask the question and i
reject that
because i think that there's the the
range of what is
normal to be human it's just so vast
such a vast range
that's well within it in my opinion the
people who have
you know non-standard thoughts about
their sexual
entity it's just sort of normal
i wouldn't call that a mental illness
it's just
people are different um
at the point that 41 of people like you
are killing themselves
now is is there a high there is a high
suicide rate among the trans community
right
i don't know that it's that high i don't
think it is
but you can imagine that that would be
an unusually
difficult life
so it wouldn't surprise me
all right um
that's all i got for now and uh somebody
says tennis i quit tennis because it was
too hard on my body now i only do what i
call monkey exercises
a monkey exercises something similar to
what an
ape or a monkey would do
as opposed to running a marathon no
monkey runs a marathon
but they might sprint and climb up a
tree and lift a baby
and pull themselves up on a on a limb
so i do things that are weight training
and flexibility
and sprinting but i don't do distance
and antennas is such a non-uh
natural act you you just end up killing
all your joints and then you can't
exercise
so so that's that's my situation
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you later
