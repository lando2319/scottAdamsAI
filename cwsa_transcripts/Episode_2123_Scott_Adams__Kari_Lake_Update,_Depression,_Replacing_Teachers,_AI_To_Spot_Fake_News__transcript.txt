dream
good morning everybody
and it's a Memorial Day
and if you'd like to take a moment of
silence on your end
okay that's good that's all you need for
now we don't want to spend it all in the
first thing in the morning you want to
take lots of moments of Silence during
the day
now if you'd like your Memorial Day to
be the most special and oh let's say
respectful whatever there's something
you need that you haven't done yet and
all you need is a cup of Margaret a
glass of take your chalice's diet a
canteen Joker flask a vessel of any kind
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the double media doesn't say
anything that makes everything better
this one's for our Fallen Soldiers
for Memorial Day
it happens now go
ah
delightful
all right
um in no particular order
my favorite story of the day was the
family
that claims they adopted a six-year-old
daughter or thought they did they
thought they were adopting a
six-year-old girl from Ukraine
but they believed they got an adult who
is pretending to be a six-year-old girl
that's not the interesting part the
interesting part is that this
person that they believe is an adult
pretending to be a six-year-old
but other people aren't so sure she
might actually be a kid
but she's also trying to kill them
yeah on several occasions she tried to
poison them and stab them and trick the
kids into running into traffic
so she's a murderous potentially adult
pretending to be a six-year-old that got
adopted from Ukraine
if you were going to try to make an
analogy
of the Ukraine war
and our involvement in it
could you come up with anything that
would be better than the six-year-old
girl
who might be an adult who might be
trying to kill every member of the
family
sometimes the reality hands you a gift
of an analogy that's so perfect you
don't have to add anything to it
now part of the story is that if if the
person is an adult masquerade against a
child
then um it's because there's some kind
of dwarfism
disease involved or conditioned I don't
know what you call it
but if it's an adult it's not a very
high functioning one
and if it's a child it's weirdly uh
advanced in some ways such as sexually
so uh that's a lot of trouble there
um I don't know I don't know what's it
involved in unadopting somebody but I
would be unadopting as quickly as I
could
all right I have an idea for fixing the
cities you ready
idea for fixing the cities
the federal government should make it
illegal
for elected State elected City
officials
to spend money
just couldn't do it
yeah you have to take the money spending
out of the elected officials hands for
the cities the reason is that it's all
corrupt you know that you don't fix
anything unless you have control over
where you move your money
and if it's just going to corrupt family
members and hiring hiring of cousins and
stuff like that so
I'm not positive but my brief experience
of trying to deal with a a Democrat
Inner City because I had some experience
trying to do that
is you actually can't do anything unless
you bribe them
did you know that
if you're trying to work with a city
trying to get them to do anything they
will ask for a bribe they'll do it
directly now it'll usually be you know
what would be great is I've got this
project to try to build a park
you know if you could help fund that
Park
probably those things you're asking for
that might happen as well
if you could just fund that Park
so I think you have to take funding all
all kinds of funding and spending away
from the local officials because the
odds of them being corrupt are near 100
percent
it's near 100
so you just have to take that power away
from them somehow or have some kind of
an oversight thing that you trust I
don't know how you design that
all right
so uh are you all surprised that at the
last minute they came up with a debt
ceiling increase that saved the country
big surprise
everybody totally surprised because it's
what I told you the first minute the
story happened that they don't get
serious until the last minute because
they don't have to and then the last
minute they look at their poll numbers
and they decide how bad it would be
and then they make a deal because they
have to
that was never real
yeah that whole story was never real
they were always going to do exactly
what they did
and then we'll argue over who made the
worser deal
but of course that will be aided by the
fact that we will not be informed what
the deal is
and then it will be put into some form
that you can't discern it because it'll
be too long
so Thomas Massey was talking about the I
don't know 5 000 Pages it might end up
to be and he suspected they would have
72 hours
Congress to look over the 5 000 pages of
detailed complexity to decide whether to
vote for him
we have come up with a system that's a
confusopoly
meaning that the only way anything
happens is if people aren't sure what it
is they're doing
because if you were sure you knew what
you were doing you object to it
so you have to get reached we reach a
situation with a system where neither
side is quite sure what happened
I know I feel like we got some stuff
and I feel like the other side got some
stuff
I have a vague understanding of what our
stuff was and what their stuff is but I
don't really know how to compare them
because I only have these two vague
ideas of who got what so I can't even
argue because I don't know if the other
side did better than us it's confusing
so we have a system that requires nobody
understands what's happening
or it wouldn't happen
think about that the system requires
that not only the public but the people
voting for the bills not quite
understand them
because if they did they would have
specific things to complain about but if
they don't quite understand the bigger
picture
They Don't Really they can't get any
attraction to complain
so the only way you can get rid of the
complaints is to make it too confusing
for anybody to participate in a
meaningful way
that's our system
our system is to remove humans from the
process by making it too complicated for
them to participate
is that correct or no is that does that
characterization capture what we're
watching every time they go through this
process
it's exactly that they make it too
complicated so humans can't productively
get involved
because you'd never get anything done if
humans were productively evolved
they have to they have to create a
system which is absurd by its design
it's intentionally absurd because that's
actually the only way they think it's
done
so Thomas Massey on his tweet about you
know they'd have 72 hours to look at 5
000 pages of complexity
and so I suggest that
they ask AI to summarize it for them
let that sink in
what if it could
what if you could just turn AI loose on
and say all right here's the summary I'm
going to summarize this in plain English
so you can see what's happening
well the first problem is AI might not
do it right right because AI is a little
biased and sometimes it makes up stuff
so it could actually just make up some
 and say oh this isn't the bill it
says save the koala Bearer part of the
bill
at which point you'd say uh that's not
even in that bill so that's a risk but I
suppose we could probably fact check
that pretty quickly and know what's in
and out
but what if it worked
well what if AI could actually tell you
in a real summary way
even who did a better job in negotiating
that'd be really dangerous but suppose
it could just tell you what the bill is
so you wouldn't have to read it
they would have to ban it
AI would be banned from that use
because it would allow you to understand
what's in the bill and that would break
the whole system that's not a joke if
you understood what was in it it
couldn't get passed
that's
that's just true
so there's a we keep finding these
examples where even if AI could solve
what you think is the problem it's not
the real problem
the real problem is that we can't deal
with decision making we don't have any
capacity to do that you know beyond a
certain level of complexity and
self-interest we don't have any capacity
so
we would have to ban AI from summarizing
legislation because the net effect is we
would understand it
just think about that that's a real
thing I mean that entirely seriously you
could not have a good understanding by
the public of the government's operation
without breaking it and then what do you
do
all right
um Jane Fonda
has helpfully suggested
um that the real problem in the world is
uh white men
and that the white men the patriarchy
they're responsible for racism and of
course climate change indirectly well
directly I guess and her suggestion is
that maybe all the white men should be
rounded up and put in jail arrested and
jailed
so got that going on
you know I thought about oh I'm going to
add my layers of interest in commentary
on top of that
what the hell could I layer on top of
that
is there anything that can be funnier or
more ridiculous or more absurd or more
of a sign of the times
oh let's do our little thing where we
reverse the
reverse the ethnicities of the people
involved
so let's see Jane Fonda said that all
the problems are black men and they
should all be arrested and jailed
now she didn't say that
but I wonder if she could have
no of course she could of course she
could
all right I saw the uh Khan Academy
founder I guess his name is Khan and he
was talking about how AI is going to
change it's going to be such a radical
change for Education that it's basically
just everything will be different in
about a year probably this is probably
the best thing that AI will do unless it
gets outlawed which is possible
um
because there's no there's no
possibility
that AI won't do a better job than real
teachers
am I right now maybe not on day one on
day one maybe the best human teacher is
still better than the best AI but there
aren't that many of those you know
whoever is the best human teachers top
five percent
not many people
so for most people
the AI would be much better now I saw
some pushback and people said Scott you
saw what remote learning did during the
pandemic obviously remote learning
doesn't work
we never tested AI remote learning we
tested humans
and and the human was one person with a
crowd of a bunch of people who weren't
being supervised watching
if you had a one-on-one class where your
AI is designed to be exactly the
character that your child wants to
listen to
you know if there if the kid is five
years old
they give it you know Barney or Pikachu
or some character to teach them English
teach them you know ABCs
but if they're a little older other
teenagers maybe the boys want a female
in some cases maybe the women want a
female too there might be some types of
teachers that just work better for some
personality types at certain ages so if
you have exactly the right AI that
looked and acted human but it was
exactly the one you were willing to
listen to
do you think you'd learn more if you
could actually interact and they could
learn about you and they could they
could ask how your day went and they
would know what you did when you weren't
with them and they could follow up on it
and all that stuff
I don't know
so there but there is one wild card
here that
I don't know how to value
and it goes like this
if you if you tell me Scott you have to
go exercise
and you say you have two choices you can
do it in your home gym all by yourself
or you could do it at a gym where
everybody is exercising at the same time
only one of those is going to get me to
exercise enough and believe me I'm
struggling with this because I quit my
gym I absolutely can't work out at home
as much I just cannot put in the time
because I'm bored
I'm bored and I need the energy of the
other people I need the the peer
pressure of the other people to to lift
me up that's why I belong to a gym that
was the main reason I belonged and it's
the same with school
you put me in a human School situation
where I'm looking around at my
competitors and I saw them that way by
the way I saw the other students as my
competitors and I'd be like game on
give me that test let me see if I can
beat all these people
and and so the the peer pressure the
feeling of other people doing at the
same time it would put me in the right
energy
for doing the things in school wanted me
to do now you put me a home on my own
schedule
and I turned on this thing and the AI is
perfect it knows everything that's a
great teacher but do I have the right
energy
do I have the right energy to want to
sit there and listen to a machine for
for six hours
per day
I feel like the human part
can't be removed without removing the
incentive the the shared incentive the
the slop over feeling from your fellow
human beings I think you need the you
need the slop over feeling from other
people to get some stuff done so that's
what I worry about
now that might there might be a way to
fix that by making sure that when you
use your AI there were other people in
the room and other students and you know
you you met with your other students
every half hour to do a project or
something I don't know there's there's
probably some way to get the humans back
in there but if you take the humans out
um I just worry that your normal biology
won't rise to the
rise to the challenge
all right
I can tell you that I had the hottest
French teacher in the history of French
teachers and if you don't think I
enjoyed going to that class every day
and did it make me study harder because
the French teacher
Ms rossen I remember her quite clearly
uh was so insanely attractive that
you basically could barely
barely concentrate
I got an A in French
I get an A in French and when my sister
took the same course a few years later
I was used as an example of somebody who
could get an A in a language course
without being able to speak any of it
I I'm the worst friendship speaker
but if you give me a you know a test
with multiple choice or something I can
pretty much Ace it so I I added a in
French I couldn't speak a link could
couldn't speak a sentence except you
know
bibliotech that was about it
all right but I like the class
um
so here's the good news if AI replaces
human teachers we will have a way to get
rid of the biggest
source of systemic racism in the country
imagine if you will
that a poor black kid in an urban area
could get an AI teacher this is good as
everybody else's AI teacher no
difference just as good
for the first time ever
in a related point
can you think of any profession in which
in which the profession as a whole has
failed so spectacularly over the last
they'll say 10 years
I keep reading about the number of
specifically black students who can read
at class level is something like 12
percent or in some teachers zero or some
places zero zero
zero there's not a single person who
could read at grade level
can you think of any situation where you
could keep your job with those
statistics
of the future AI teachers unions yeah
that could happen
yeah
well
so maybe if we get rid of teachers we
could get rid of teachers unions and
then maybe black Americans have a chance
in the United States because otherwise
you're just going to get teachers that
either won't or can't control the class
and can't teach for whatever reason they
can't teach it might not be the
teacher's fault but I've never seen a
profession that failed thoroughly like
just completely
and they still have their jobs
what's up with that
yeah I think that the wokeness problem
the falling behind other countries
problem pretty much all of it is related
to our bad teachers
which is related to the bad teachers
unions
all right
there's a study using magnetism
to try to cure depression in some types
of people so they say it won't work for
all types of depression but it's so
weird what they did they use magnetic
technology
to quote reverse the flow of the neural
stream from one part of the brain to the
other part of the brain
how Wild is that
so they know that the normal brain of a
depressed person again not every
depressed person they're different but
some category of depressed people they
can identify with imaging that there's
too much neural activity going from one
part of the brain to the other
so they can actually hook a magnetic
device to you and reverse the flow of
the neural traffic
and it makes you feel good because it
makes you feel the way regular people do
because that's the direction their
neural Pathways go and I guess you can
train it after a while to not need the
magnets so you can actually just reverse
it and and cure people in Fairly short
amount of time now here's what
I love about that
suppose it's true
that we can identify the flow of neural
whatever it is
neural streams I don't know neurons well
I don't know exactly what's flowing I
guess just the electrical signal is the
thing that's flowing
but just a signal is slowing right it's
not physically anything it's a signal
that's flowing so what if we can
identify all of the major neural
Pathways that are normal
and we can watch them flow and what if
this technology improves so that we can
Target any one of those neural Pathways
and reverse or slow down its flow
you could actually physically reprogram
a brain and they already are you can
physically reprogram a brain
physically
and do you know how you reprogram a
computer
the same way
that's how you reprogram a computer
with Magnetic technology if you want to
put something on the hard disk
you change it magnetically
it's the same damn technology we're
using for computers just optimized for a
brain that's moist instead of silicon
that's dry and that's the main
difference but the the the
the future that you could imagine where
they can change the direction of your
neural signals
less like insanely exciting if we do it
right
yes I am reprogramming your brain right
now Ian Can you feel it in real time
so that's kind of exciting these are
giving you all the good news ahead kind
of stories
um
question what would happen if AI
learned how to identify fake news
what would happen
because again we are a nation that's
held together by fake news
everything that we do is pretty much
based on something that wasn't true
now sometimes it's good for us and
sometimes it's not but it's all based on
lies
what if AI told you what what the lies
were as they were happening
and you came to trust its judgment
well the first question is how well can
it do
and I would argue that I could already
train it with a super prompt
now a super prompt is
basically asking it a question but
adding a lot of caveats to the question
so you prevent the AI from going into
the wrong direction it's a way to
constrain the ai's answer to the most
useful answer so a super prompt could be
for example
hey AI the following rules have been
known to identify fake news not with 100
accuracy now everything I'm saying by
right now this entire long form of
everything I'm about to say would be
part of the prompt
because AI doesn't care if the prompt is
a page long
because it can handle the complexity so
you can put stuff in there hey AI I want
you to see if you can identify some fake
news
and here are the tips for how to do it
number one
if both sides of the political Spectrum
report it the same it's probably true if
one side reports it but the other side
says it's not true its credibility goes
down 75 percent
so that's just a rule now everything
would be based on uh the odds not yes no
so if you see this situation where one
side assess is true the other side says
it's not
reduce the credibility by 75 percent
okay or whatever right I'm making up the
75 percent
uh next rule would be uh if it's too on
the nose in other words if it's a if it
fits too cleanly an existing narrative
assume that it's probably artificial
now I don't know how you'd get it to
understand what a narrative is or
whether something fit it but that's what
the AI is supposed to do I guess how
about this as part of your question if
you see that they're trying to prove a
negative
that's that's a sign
there was no um there was no election
irregularities because we didn't find
any
if they if the story is presented to you
as proving a negative we proved it
doesn't exist by not looking in the
right places then your credibility
should be lowered
um how about if you recognize the
players
from past lies
for example if there's a new topic
tomorrow and the name that you see the
most is Adam Schiff
John Brennan
and Clapper
James Clapper if you saw those three
people on the same side of a story
you you should discount his credibility
based on experience
if the story comes from Maggie Haberman
you should put a different odds on the
credibility of that story then maybe a
story that comes from Glenn Greenwald if
you know what I mean
if he catch my drift you know you're
going to give the Mad taibi a little bit
of higher credibility than you know uh
Stephen Collinson and CNN they're not
equals right some are known
propagandists and some are known
independent journalists who are actually
just trying to get the story
so you could tell AI which people to
trust based on experience
you could say if there are politicians
don't believe anything
so he says I'm being anti-Semitic
okay
um
here's another one if the claim is
outrageous to the point of absurdity
it's probably not true
this is the real world that's always the
case
um
now sometimes things are absurd
but it's so rare that The credibility of
a story should be lowered if it's if the
claim is like amazingly absurd oh I
think an alien came and
ate Russia all right if you heard that
and you say I feel like I would have
heard if Russia disappeared
so that's like a kind of a crazy claim
so could AI understand what is absurd
do you think AI could understand an
unlikely story from a likely story based
on just knowing what is average and
normal
maybe I think it could
um
How about if it's still the fog of War
suppose it's early in a complicated
story
should the AI then discount the story as
too early to know of course they should
I do that's that's what I tell you every
time we have a new complicated story I
always say the same thing
everything that's being reported
is in doubt just wait for it to settle
so hey I could learn that
um
do you think that the AI could identify
something that fits a narrative
could it identify a narrative and then
sort of fact that get a fact that fits
it too closely
you think you would be able to do that
I think it could maybe all right so what
would happen if you got to the point
where somebody built an AI fact checker
or they built a super prompt that's
basically it's embedded with all the
little tips I just gave you and more so
you'd add some more tips for spotting
fake news
so and then the AI says uh I will rate
this news story as 30 credible
what would happen to AI if AI was known
to actually be really really good as
spotting fake news
it would be illegal
it would have to be illegal
because again we do not have a system
that can survive real news
we can't survive the truth
you know maybe if we could invent some
new system
there might be a different kind of
system that can survive accurate news
but we don't have one
um
it would be hard for the AI to spot
missing context
would it
would it be hard for the AI to spot
missing context
maybe hard but not impossible
you know because it's hard for people to
do it right
how often have I told you
I've got one of these dogs not barking
stories and when you hear it you say Oh
shoot that's true
if this if this story were true why
would we not be hearing about this other
thing why would there be total silence
on this other area I feel like AI could
sometimes get it but given that one of
the things that makes people
come to watch this show is that I can do
it more often than other people
meaning I can spot the missing part more
reliably than some other people paying
attention just because I'm looking for
it I'm actively looking for the missing
parts
but maybe AI can learn that
all right uh
in case you think that the news is a
brand new wonderful spectacle every day
as opposed to the groundhog situation
that it really is where the news just
repeats over and over again
sometimes the dates and the names change
but it's the same news
would you like to hear some news that
you're pretty sure you already heard
before
and you will hear again just the names
of the details will change
all right here it comes according to
Carrie Lake they found a definite strong
evidence of irregularity in the Maricopa
voting
does that sound like any story you've
ever heard before
hahaha
it's it's cracking version 56.
there's the Kraken again okay no that's
not the Kraken but where do you see what
we got next I'll agree those other
Krakens were not really at the Kraken
that we hoped but man we're cracking now
with our Krakens our Krakens are so
cracking they're just
crispy crapping cracking
well
I'll say the same thing that I say every
time this story comes up because you
know it won't be the last time either
the claim is uh let's say captured in
documents and captured on video
and is unambiguously supportive of the
claim that is kind of complicated but it
has to do with when the some of the
county machines were tested and there's
some irregularity in the timeline and
some things clearly were not according
to process
that's the claim now what do you think
will happen when all the debunkers and
the people who know how Stuff work weigh
in do you think the officials who manage
the elections are going to look at this
evidence and say whoa
good point we never would have caught
this thank you Carrie Lake for bringing
this to our attention but it does appear
that some Bad actors have reprogrammed
some of the counting machines in an
inappropriate way that could have
changed the results
do you think that's going to happen
I don't think so
I don't think so I think it's going to
be like every other time
you will you will see a fact check or
set of fact checks that you don't
believe
but they will be the official fact
checks
and the official fact checks will say
well it looks like it's sketchy but
that's because you don't understand that
the process normally does this and yes
you might think that that this part of
the process is sub-optimal but if you
check the statutes you'll see that's
allowed oh yes this does cause some
confusion and possibly this would be an
area that somebody could have cheated
but we see no evidence that they did
cheat
all the evidence that it was possible
right you know the whole story and then
if if something ever gets to court you
know how that ends
oh yes you made your point but this
court does not judge uh that point or we
don't have jurisdiction or you don't
have standing
yeah the claim might be true we're not
going to even judge it because you don't
have a standing
right you know exactly where this is
going it's a big complicated claim with
lots of documentation and a video
that seem to support the claim
we won't understand the details of it so
so people want to believe it will
believe it people who don't want to
believe it we'll say it's
then it will go through this whole
checking Arrow phase by the other side
and it'll be all confusing
because I read the story and it's almost
incomprehensible
it's almost incomprehensible and if if
Carrie Lake would like some advice on
communication you need to get this on
one page
she's got like a extended video showing
all these documents and parts of the
documents are highlighted and then
there's a timeline with all kinds of
 on it
I have no idea here's here's is
something like this
something like this this is not it
but it's something like
the machines were tested before the
election
but then they were altered after the
test
is that close has anybody figured out
what the claim is yet that the some
machines were tested but then there is
documented and videotaped and you know
incontrovertible evidence that they were
reprogrammed again after the test
right
they were altered after they were
certified right
so they were certified and then altered
but the way they were altered
is going to turn into this
well where's your proof that the
altering changed the result well we
can't prove that we can only prove that
it could have happened and there was no
reason to do what they did
yeah yeah well they say there's a reason
yeah but there isn't a good reason yeah
but you know they say there is a reason
but it's not a good reason
but they have a reason
and then they'll say where's your
evidence that they did in fact use this
opening to change the result well we
don't have that but it was illegal
so you should overturn it because it was
illegal
do you think the court is going to
overturn an election that's been
certified for two years
or whatever it is by the time they get
around to it
no no the courts will and I'm not sure
this is wrong by the way I don't know
that this is a would be a bad move by
the courts courts like stability
they like the system to be stable
all other things being equal so that the
most stability they could add to the
system would be to not overturn the
election
so I think the courts would find a
reason to not overturn the election
worst case scenario or the most
aggressive thing they might do is say
you know you ought to look into changing
that
you've got a process there that maybe
you ought to keep out of the courts you
know maybe modify that a little bit for
next time that's it
and then do you think they'll modify it
for next time
of course not
of course not why would they
so this is one of those stories where
you can pretty much judge from the very
first word where it will go
and it has nothing to do with whether
the claim is valid or invalid that I
don't know
but regardless whether the claim is
valid or invalid
it will go down the invalid pathway
because that's the only one there is
there's not a pathway for a valid claim
to go anywhere
is there
except to conspiracy theory books that
some people believe and other people
don't
so nothing I think nothing will be done
but they might have found they might
have found the footprints of the Kraken
but the footprints don't prove the
Kraken
they just might have some footprits
all right
um
Nvidia
has a new technology that lets Gamers
talk to the NPCs in your game
now you could probably do that for a
while now but now the NPCs will have
full AI
kind of conversational talents so they
can now make it an NPC a non-player
character
is a game that will look and act like a
person
but you don't live in a simulation do
you no this this isn't the simulation of
course not
how much longer can we watch our
technology build simulations
before you realize that you're in one
how much further could we push this
as as anybody's flipped over to
believing that we're a simulation
because of ai's success lately
especially the Deep fakes is there
anybody who changed their mind recently
see one yes
mostly knows
all right
so here
's my speculation
my speculation is is that we will
someday come to the beliefs that we are
a simulation in other words that I
believe that will be a common
understanding at some point
but to get there we will have to get
closer and closer to creating our own
simulation
with characters who believe they're real
that we can observe and then watch them
acting just the way we do
you'd be looking at them and you say
wait a minute they just formed a
religion
right you're going to watch them do
everything we would do and then you will
know you are a simulation
admit you believe in god well I believe
that we are created by a higher power
but probably somebody who's not that
different from us
and I also believe that humans are have
now achieved a god-like powers
that's right
humans now have God Powers because what
is a god power God power would be to
create a universe right well we can do
that now
we can do that you can create a
simulated universe
God power is only God can make a tree
right well we can do that I can make a
tree that the characters in my
simulation believe is a trait and they
would have no evidence otherwise
so we have now achieved god-like power
however here's the irony it doesn't
apply to our own existence
it's a Godlike power that we can only
apply to the world that we create for
that purpose but we can't we can't use
those powers in our own world
unless the unless the affirmations are
that power
sometimes I think we can
all right
[Applause]
um
we have an Insider report on uh Trump's
opinion of Tim Scott
and there's a quote that could be fake
news because it comes from an anonymous
source but it sounds true uh and the
quote was uh from allegedly from Trump
about Tim Scott quote I like him we're
just going to say nice things about Tim
now
let's see if there's a parallel here
so Ron DeSantis was pro-trump
but then decided to run against them
and then Trump called him disloyal
is that I'm correct so far right
then Tim Scott who has worked
productively with Trump enough so that
Trump still likes him
decides to run against Trump
and Trump does not call him disloyal huh
huh
foreshadowing
follow the foreshadowing let's see one
person is disloyal and the person who
did the same kind of similar things not
disloyed at all nice guy they like him
I feel like your next vice president is
lining up
now at the very least
Trump has him on his shortest of the
short list would you agree
at the very least Tim Scott is on the
shortest of the shortlist he's top three
no question about it
and then um
who's the other gentleman
uh Donaldson
is it Donaldson
Donaldson right
the other Trump supporter from Byron
Donaldson right and and Byron
Donaldson's been getting Byron Donald's
I'm sorry
Byron Donalds that is the correctment
um
and he's been getting a lot of attention
just by being good at his job meaning
he's communicating really well
and he's presenting his his side and his
team's side of the argument in arguments
that people are you know we're we're
finding compatible with our own thinking
let's say
so he's a really strong uh
personality
but I don't know that he's a seasoned
or as credible as Tim Scott because you
know you like a senator better than a
congress person right
yeah and you don't want to have too many
Donalds in your ticket
I mean it bothers me enough that there
might be a Scott on the ticket that's
going to bug me enough
yep Tim's a bachelor but we don't care
uh which is actually another advantage
I I would love
no I I hate to say this but
yeah let's leave Tim Scott's personal
life alone
what do you think
do you think that's a do you think
that's something we should do
just leave Tim Scott his personal life
alone
let it let it just be whatever it is
whatever it is it is
because conservatives can't be
consistent with their own their own
philosophies if they get too interested
in that right if you get too interested
you're not being consistent with your
own principles
you you should be aggressively
uninterested in that question
aggressively uninterested
and let's see if we can maintain that I
feel like that would be the consistent
way to be a conservative to be
aggressively uninterested and somebody
who's minding their own business
minding their own business and being a
good Patriot
what else do you want
doesn't bother you
good Patriot
we're done here
all right
and by the way we don't I'm not making
any assumptions about Tim Scott's
private life
that's part of the deal too is I don't I
don't even have to make an assumption
are you just saying none of my business
and get on with it
all right
did you see a uh there was a video from
Dylan Mulvaney
um talking about informed his parents
that he might be interested in women
and then talked about
um Dylan talked about the transition
from
I believe
Dylan claimed to be gay and then claimed
to be queer then claimed to be
non-binary and then claimed to be trans
and now is questioning whether
um
she likes women
so
does it does it feel to you
that this is more about a theater and
less about
somebody's personal decisions
it's just theater
yeah
I don't know how we ever came to care so
much well I guess I do know it's not
none of this was about Dylan Mulvaney
right
let's be honest when I got canceled it
wasn't really about me at all I was just
a vehicle that could people could put
their feelings in and you know it'd be
like a little truck they could take us
somewhere I think Dylan Mulvaney is the
same thing literally nobody cares about
Dylan's private life nobody
but Dylan isn't like me a little truck
that you can put your political opinions
in and take it somewhere so
um
you said you thought he was gay well
that's what Dylan says Dylan thought
Dylan was gay
and then thought Dylan was queer and
then non-binary and now Dylan thinks
Dylan is trans but maybe a trans lesbian
I don't know I'm not sure how that works
but so in case you're wondering in the
uh in the Dilbert reborn comic that you
can only see if you're subscribing on
either the locals platform where you get
lots more than Dilbert or on the
uh Twitter platform you can subscribe
I've got a subscribe button in my
profile and you can see just the dildo
reborn comic but uh I'll tell you about
an upcoming week
Dilbert's company is going to hire a new
head of marketing
a new head of marketing
uh who is a woman and she's in charge of
their marketing for their power tools
division
so they're going to give a woman vice
president and charge the power tools
division
and her first uh suggestion will be to
hire Dylan Mulvaney as an influencer for
their power tools
so that's what you're missing if you
don't subscribe
um
it goes great by the way it just goes
great
all right
um
yes we don't need to make
uh
sex Tool uh accusations just because
it's power tools
all right
now that ladies and gentlemen
brings me to the end of my prepared
remarks on this Memorial Day
um is there any story that I missed that
you need to get my valuable opinion on
right it took about two minutes for
somebody to mention Snap-on tools
that that took longer than I thought
all right um
UAP
the uaps you know I saw Elon Musk on
some interview he did recently where it
appears he's become a
believer in the pre-ice age Advanced
civilization concept have you all been
watching that it's mostly a YouTube
thing there are a whole bunch of videos
people taking different positions on uh
how
and I guess Elon Musk gave the one
example that's in some of these videos
that I think it was the skill of writing
popped up in different civilizations all
over the world at the same time
and it couldn't have been a coincidence
because they didn't have any connection
and how could humans be evolving for you
know hundreds of thousands of years then
just about the same time
they develop writing skills in different
places now the suspicion is
that there was some Advanced uh race
that was on Earth and got wiped out by
the Ice Age changes
and maybe there were some survivors or
some missionaries who you know took
their knowledge to other places or
whatever
Maybe
yeah Graham Hancock is on that so part
of that belief is that the Sphinx was
not built by the Egyptians or anybody
that they could remember
but they sort of claimed it because it
was on their territory
and that it might have been some
Advanced civilization
now the pyramids themselves I think are
a little sketchy aren't they
because it it almost looks like the
pyramids were built for one purpose
and then the the Kings used them for
another purpose which is they buried
themselves inside them it doesn't even
look like they were built for the
purpose of burial tubes it was like they
had some bigger purpose
so we're seeing all these hints that
maybe Atlantis was real maybe there was
more than one Atlantis maybe they had
some Advanced civilization
now connect that to the UFO spottings
we've had
and the one thing that we hear more than
other things it's that they must be
drones because the way they move no
human could survive the g-forces or no
organic entity
so that they think it must be all
mechanical
because it moves too fast
and some of them will swim underwater
they say
so
what do you think is more likely
there's some leftover drones from an
advanced civilization that might be just
on autopilot
they might be either servicing
themselves and maintaining themselves in
some underground Factory that's just
operating since the the people who built
it all died it just keeps going and it's
just doing its routine
all it's doing is sending out some
drones to look at stuff and coming back
it doesn't have any purpose but it
doesn't know it has no purpose
that would explain everything wouldn't
it it will explain all of the Atlantis
missing civilization and they would
explain why we have UFOs and yet no
visits from any any creatures
how could we have so many UFOs but
nobody's tried to make contact
and the most logical explanation is
there's nobody to contact
isn't it if you had to look at all the
possibilities
let's say you accepted I don't accept
this as true but if you did accept is
true that there are a bunch of UFOs that
are legitimately high-tech
objects that are moving in a way that a
great organic creature could not survive
I think that's the most likely
possibility is that there is some kind
of leftover technology from an earth
civilization
that found a way to keep its drones
running
and maybe self-maintain them we might
find someday there's a undersea Factory
where their robots were repairing
themselves and you know they got spare
parts and and for a hundred thousand
years
they've just been doing their robot
thing under there
and they don't have any reason to
contact us because that was never their
programming they're not designed to
contact anybody they're just designed to
go look around and make some videos and
record them and then they do it again
that's a horizon zero Dawn what is that
modern Romans have no knowledge of
Romans who built the stadium but the
stadium isn't really amazing
I think that was more in line with what
they knew how to do in the day
it was a video game
how does that jive with simulation
Theory
well whatever it is this could be the
simulation now in simulation Theory I
say the most provocative thing that
nobody else says about the simulation
at least I've never heard it and to me
it's a way to prove the simulation
it goes like this if we are a simulation
we don't have a past
because we would have been created you
know out of nothing so the past just
didn't exist at the moment of creation
but since in order to feel like we're
real characters we would have to believe
we had a past the simulation would
create the past on demand
so my example of that is if you've never
dug a hole in your backyard
there's nothing under there
you start digging and as you dig the
simulation fills in the hole I mean it
creates the detail that looks like hey I
found a fossil in here yeah right so you
find a dinosaur bone
and then the and then the simulation has
to recreate the dinosaur
right but it won't recreate anything
until you need it
so the past is is an invention of the of
the current times
so the question was how did the theory
that there were ancient Advanced
civilizations how does that fit into
simulation Theory
it fits this way
there were no Advanced civilizations
we're creating them now
we are creating them out of our minds
and now they're becoming real
so there will be an Atlantis eventually
but not yet
in other words there will be an Atlantis
in our past because we're in the process
of creating it
but it does not exist in our past yet
in other words the past will be created
in our future
and it's the only way it can work
can't work any other way the reason it
can't work any other way is that no
simulation
could put everything in the universe and
hold it in his mind and and rotate it
and keep it consistent with everything
else in the universe because the
Computing requirement would be too
massive so instead what the software
does is exactly what a video game does
it creates a little universe and that it
doesn't let you get outside of its
barriers
so what we believe there we believe that
when we see light from a star
when we see light from the start we
believe that there's an actual you know
planet or sun up there
but maybe not
maybe it's just light
and and there wouldn't be a planet there
unless we've built a technology where we
could study we could follow that light
back to its source and as we approach
the source the planet or the star would
appear in the real world for the first
time
it wasn't there until you looked at it
all right God is outside of time yes
that would be similar to a simulation
so if we were to build a simulation the
simulation sense of time would not be
the same as our time the creators we
would be outside
of their time in fact we you could fast
forward their time so that they're at 10
times the time of the Creator's time and
they wouldn't know the difference as
long as everything got got moved forward
at the same rate
their car would still look like it's
going 65 miles an hour they wouldn't
know that it's going a thousand miles an
hour they would have no way to know
because it's only going a thousand miles
an hour outside the simulation
there there's no there's no preferred
speed
there's only the speed from the
perspective of the Observer
take that Einstein
all right
what about the mycelium Theory
well that is how I will power my
mycelium drive and my spaceship
but beyond that that's all I know
do we get to know when we're buffering
I don't think we would because
if you imagine that we're artificial if
we all stopped at the same time because
the processor stopped
and then we immediately started at the
same time
we wouldn't know that we never stopped
um
was yesterday a simulation
well yesterday doesn't have to have been
fake because once you do it is real
yes
why did the simulation rig the election
well all right here's gonna here's a
real mind blower
if we're a simulation which is what I
believe
it can be true that the election was not
rigged and also that it was rigged
and it's like a Schrodinger's cat
situation so until you can find evidence
that would convince everybody that
they're looking at the same thing
here it is
if you can't produce that then both
possibilities exist forever
but if you've got a whistleblower who
had you know photos and videos and
documents and recorded phone calls then
suddenly the reality would collapse and
then it would become a rigged election
but until that
it is neither rigged nor non-rigged
because you don't know it is a
Schrodinger Scout situation and I
genuinely see it that way by the way
that's my actual impression of reality
is that that reality has not collapsed
so it's not a case of whether we can
find it or not
because it's not there
it's a question of whether we can create
it can we create a past
well actually this will be a good test
to find that if Kerry lake is a player
or an NPC
if Carrie lake is an NPC
then she will not be able to create the
past and the election will stand
if she's a player and she might be
I would definitely not rule that out if
she's a player
she will create
through her own imagination a reality
which will become all of our actual
reality that it was rigged and it will
be found in ways that you didn't expect
so that's my theory it is neither rigged
nor not rigged
it's it's a black box it's yeah it's a
shorter there's cat and
if we never opened the box it will never
the reality will never form into one
actual reality it'll always have the
potential but will there will never be
an actual reality of whether it was
rigged or not
is cwcville real I don't know what that
is
all right is Trump a player clearly yeah
there's one thing you can say for sure
is that if we're simulation Trump is a
player because he can change the
simulation
he changes what you believe is true
that's that's as player as you get
yeah I mean I do the same thing when I
change Minds
it's a rare thing so somebody can change
your mind they're probably a player
all right
if we create our personal God before we
die do we get one
well it depends depends what dying means
in the simulation
so you don't get a personal God if your
program just gets turned off
but maybe the program gives you an
afterlife
what what if the program provides an
afterlife
they might it might be an afterlife
all right
everyone is influential in some form or
another yes but not at the same degree
um
okay
I can change your mind you say
maybe you can
yeah Russia Russia issued an arrest
warrant for Senator Lindsey Graham
they just made a big old list of people
who are their enemies it looked like it
was randomly created
all right
um
why does a disease kill in the
simulation so it looks real
all right that's all for now YouTube I'm
going to talk to the locals people a
little bit more
and I will see you later
