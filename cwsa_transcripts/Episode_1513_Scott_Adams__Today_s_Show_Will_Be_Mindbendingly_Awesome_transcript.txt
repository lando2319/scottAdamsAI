point checklist
13 of them checked
one of them not checked
guess which one i didn't check
that would be the one where i turn
around and take my notes off of the
printer
which don't exist
so it looks like you're going to be
watching me print my notes
i don't know what could be more fun than
that really
but it's going to be a great show today
promise you
by the way i'm working on my
uh i'm working on some some kind of a
drum sting
to open up the show
and
uh so you might hear that you you're
probably familiar with the tucker
carlson opening he's got a little uh
drum thing
[Music]
and i'm trying to
try to do something like that like five
seconds of a drum
some kind of a drum thing
but we'll see all right so boo the cat
boo the cat is back and uh
i've got 10 days of feeding her through
a tube and medicating her
let me tell you how complicated it is
to be uh my age and have a sick cat
and a full-time job
let me just give you a sense of the
complexity
now if you you've probably had enough
medical problems yourself that you know
it's just a gigantic problem to you know
get anything
solved there's just so many decisions
and medications
but i've got a cat with five different
medications with five different
schedules and i'm counting the food as a
medication because it has to be injected
and
and then you add my own
right if you're a certain age you've
probably accumulated a number of just
ordinary medications
i've got one for
um
you know acid reflux you know one one
for uh blood pressure and so i've got
something like 13 medications
with different schedules between the cat
and me
that i have to juggle
13 medications on different schedules
every day
then i have to work two full-time jobs
it's pretty ugly over here i haven't
slept a lot anyway but you know what
would be great
i think you do what would be great
the simultaneous step yeah
and you're here and you're ready for it
and it's going to be great probably one
of the best ones ever i mean i don't
want to build it up too much but i'm
feeling it are you feeling it yeah this
one's going to be good and all you need
is a cup of margarine glass a tiger
jealous a steiner canteen drinking
flaccid vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better
and
it really does
if you haven't tested this yet you got
to do a little a b testing see how you
feel with it see how you feel without
the simultaneous step or you'll be
surprised here it comes you ready go
so good
i pity the people who have not taken the
simultaneous sip because their lives are
impoverished in many ways not just
monetarily
but impoverished i say
well rasmussen has a poll that says
the supreme court is uh not too popular
these days
only 10 think the supreme court is doing
an excellent job 23 say good so you only
have 33 approval for the supreme court
now
if you had to look for one
let's say identifier
or signal
that the country might be in a little
bit of trouble
i would look at the popularity of the
supreme court
now
but
i would
i would add this
i don't know if doing a good job is the
right question for the supreme court
because the supreme court is unique
and that their entire purpose
is to make decisions that you know most
of the country is going to hate
or a lot of the countries could hate not
most
so
maybe the question should have been
if if anybody's listening to this from
rasmussen i'd love to see this question
put in terms of credibility
credibility
now that's a little bit different than
coming up with the right answer
according to you
if you're willing to trust the supreme
court even if you don't like their
decisions
then you're in good shape
do you think we're there
i feel like we are
i feel like with that they're credible
still
even though biased
right because i don't think that they
would do something that's like
ridiculously bad they would do things
you don't like but a third of the
country thinks is awesome
you know i mean that's not crazy
so i feel like their credibility would
be higher than their approval because
the approval is really about do you
agree with their decisions
do you follow on twitter bolaji
srinivasan
what you don't well you should yeah so
balaji is on my very short list of
people that everybody should be
following
because there aren't that many
independent thinkers in the world and
there are even fewer independent
thinkers who come up with ideas that you
haven't thought of yourself
it's kind of rare
but bellagi does consistently
so follow him uh
i think his uh twitter is just uh at
bellagi uh b is in boy a l a
j i
and he tweeted this morning employees
should start demanding a 90-day cooldown
period in their contracts
such that they can't be precipitously
fired due to passing social media storms
sometimes it's a real issue if so
it'll still be real in 90 days let
cooler heads prevail
what do you think of that
what do you think of that idea
it's pretty good isn't it
you know if you
if you buy into the idea that employees
should be organized at least in you know
some important ways
why isn't the union demanding this
this feels like a just basic
right down the middle
union requirement
so unions get on this i don't know if
unions just maybe you didn't think of it
but this seems like basic uh really
basic employee protection wouldn't you
say
just really basic
because i don't think this is
that the the thing that i like about
this idea
is that the moment you hear it
you wonder why it's not already being
done
right you know as soon as you hear it
you're like uh
really this is the first time we even
talked about this this is obvious once
you hear it
so i'll just put that out there unions
maybe you could do something about that
90-day cooldown period it's a good idea
you might remember that
after trump lost the election uh i was
predicting that
you would see
people on the left hunting republicans
do you remember what happened to me when
i said that
people said oh my god
scott you are way out
crazy town left field
i'll tell you one thing that's not going
to happen
they're not nobody's going to be hunting
republicans that's for sure
well a story yesterday is breaking news
and antifa member benjamin varela
allegedly
well not allegedly but he was charged
with allegedly shooting anti-mandate
protester an anti-mandate protester
was the anti-mandate protester probably
republican
or at least would this antifa member
believe that this person was probably
republican yeah
so is this a clear example of somebody
left
literally hunting
a republican
looking for somebody to shoot and then
shooting them because of their point of
view
it looks like that happened allegedly
we'll find out if it's real
all right um
the taliban big surprise they're not
going to be allowing women
to
to go to a taliban or to the kabul
university and i assume this would apply
to other universities or maybe it's the
only one i don't know
are there a lot of universities and
afghanistan
maybe just the one
i don't know
but the taliban says that women will not
be allowed until they can islamic it up
so they will be allowed later they say
but not until they can make the
environment somehow more compatible with
islam which they're not but in the
meantime they have a good solution
and uh i think you'll appreciate this
um it's sort of like
well i'll tell you what it's like after
i tell you what it is
um they're gonna use male lecturers
for the women so the so women will be
able to attend classes
in some cases but
uh there aren't enough female lecturers
so they're going to hire men
but since it would be apparently on as
on islamic according to the taliban
to have the men teaching the the girls
directly
the men will stand behind a curtain
so the man will be there in person but
behind a curtain
and i thought to myself
i don't feel like i'm nearly as
inclusive
enough in my live stream here as i could
be
because i realized how the women in
afghanistan
would not be able to watch me
because same situation right
you know man
i don't know if they could so
um i wanted to give you an example of
what i call a taliban zoom so this is
you know you know what zoom is
so the taliban
um is going to do a version of remote
learning except
it's a little bit a simpler model
instead of the technology and stuff
sort of this
hey
hey uh welcome to taliban zoom class uh
i'm your instructor scott adams and you
can't see me but uh
trust me i am totally behind this
curtain i'm not sitting at home on a
computer i'm behind this curtain giving
you a zoom class
so taliban ladies uh pay attention
so i think that worked pretty well
taliban zoom class
scene
all right here's one of my weirdest
predictions that looks like it might
come true
uh by the way how many of you
know the inside joke of the plaid
blanket
if you know the inside joke
don't tell anybody
don't don't put it in the
comments
yeah i mean you can refer to it but just
don't give away the the reveal
all right um
it turns out that bitcoin miners are
looking to nuclear power plants
to power their bitcoin mining
now
those of you who don't follow
cryptocurrency here's the quick lesson
in order to create a new bitcoin which
is created um through a process
of uh brute force computing
where it follows an algorithm a formula
if you will and only once every
you know who knows how long it depends
on your computing power you can discover
a series of i don't know let's say a
series of bits that bitcoin recognizes
as a coin
is that is that crude enough an
explanation
so in other words you can kind of
discover bitcoins
hidden in the math
all right i'm giving you the real idiots
version of this you know so the crypto
people are going crazy right now no
that's not quite accurate
but just for the you know the every
person explanation bitcoins are hidden
in math
and in order to tease them out and own
them
you have to do something called mining
which is running a powerful computer or
network of computers for long periods of
time and the more bitcoins are found the
harder it is to find the next one
so every bitcoin that you find or
creates a higher challenge for the the
next available one so you got to get
more and more computing power and you
take so much computing power to find a
bitcoin now that um it's it's a drag on
climate
the climate is actually at risk if you
accept that humans are causing climate
change so there's so much energy that
they need that they're talking to the
bitcoin miners are talking to
nuclear power plants to use their excess
nuclear power
because i guess even nuclear power
plants will generate a little bit more
than they need makes sense right they
don't want to have only just enough
so power plants are going to have uh
more
power than they need on a regular basis
but of course it'd be easy to turn off
the bitcoin part if you ever got in
trouble right so it's kind of a perfect
marriage
you put the bitcoin mine uh you know
close enough to take advantage of the
nuclear energy capacity
and suddenly you've got free bitcoins
are not free but you know
way cheaper
so
i asked this question
can bitcoin ever become
big enough
in terms of its economic potential
to pay for nuclear power
in other words could is there anybody
right now who's on putting on the
drawing board a combination nuclear
power plant
maybe gen 3 or gen 4
right next to or at least close enough
to a bitcoin
mine is anybody looking to build both of
those at the same time
because wouldn't the bitcoin mine
actually pay for the whole power plant
or would it
so this is my question if you were to do
a project that had let's say uh i don't
know 10 to 20 years to build a proper
nuclear plant if you knew it was going
to take you let's let's say you got it
down to 15 years you were doing great
which i think is a stretch but if you
get down to 15 years
could you make a 15-year economic
prediction
that if you had
relatively free energy
you could pay for the entire nuclear
plant
just with bitcoins
i'm thinking not
because i think that 15 years makes it
so hard to get a new bitcoin
that even a nuclear power plant wouldn't
be enough to get you a new one
but maybe you only need one
right
maybe bitcoin's worth
20 billion dollars in 15 years maybe one
bitcoin is worth 20 billion dollars
right
is there anybody who knows enough about
this area to tell me that that's crazy
is it crazy that one bitcoin could be
worth
15 billion dollars
20 years from now
i think i think that's possible right
because we're only using fractions of
them anyway
anyway i just put that out there is an
interesting
thing that might be happening
russell brand made news today
by being
not crazy
what
did you know that you could make news
national news he's trending all over
twitter
[Laughter]
eric i see that comment um
he's trending all over twitter for
simply being
aware
of the news apparently he is aware of
the news that hillary clinton was the
real person behind the russia conspiracy
not not trump colluding with russia but
rather hillary clinton was actually the
architect of the russia conspiracy
collusion thing
and russell brand did a show with uh
glenn greenwald who's the i would say
the
most important voice on this topic
lately
and the big news is that russell brand
actually accurately reported a story
that the left is largely blind to but
the right
largely knows
now here's the question
um we know that russell brand
identifies with the left
he would call himself a liberal i guess
and
why is it so unusual that he can simply
see a story that's in the news
right he's not making stuff up
he's simply
objectively looking at the news
and he's actually can see it and he can
talk about it
how many people on the left could do
that
how many people could hear that news
that hillary clinton was always the one
behind the russia collusion stuff and
just report it straight
just the facts
almost nobody
almost nobody and the reason is
cognitive dissonance
because if you are so committed to a
side it's just hard to change you'll
find some
weird rationalization why it really was
trump talking to putin after all even
though there's no evidence to that
whatsoever all right
so yeah bill maher is another one who's
who's uh
awake to these things now here's my
question
what makes a bill maher
or a russell brand
capable
of avoiding cognitive dissonance
or confirmation bias in this case what
is it that makes them able to do that
what what have they done
or what do they have
that allows them to be immune they've
actually got immunity to cognitive
dissonance
well i don't know but i'll give you a
few uh some speculation i mean some of
them might be genetic you know their
brain is just built a different way that
could be
but i would suggest the following number
one
think of these three people who who all
have the same quality they seem to be
able to actually just objectively look
at stuff on left or right
bill maher
russell brand
and i'll throw glenn greenwald in there
what quality do they all share
and we'll see if you can get this
what quality of this contrarian habits
that's a good one yeah so they do have a
uh
they do have enough of a history of
contrarian-ness that they can be
consistent being contrarians
so that that's actually a really good
answer wasn't what i was looking for but
that's a real better maybe better than
my answer
comedy well glenn greenwald sort of you
know indirectly maybe
fired from the
mainstream well okay
yeah fired from the mainstream was
russell brand ever fired from the
mainstream i don't know about that one
craving attention
not bad
these are actually really good
hypotheses somebody says craving
attention
yeah yeah i mean
but would they get it that way it's a i
mean they could get attention other ways
they're fact-based but why why can they
be fact-based and why can they be honest
but other people are in cognitive
dissonance
i'll tell you
i'll tell you the shrooms they all took
shrooms
oh you magnificent bastard
somebody says that they all took
mushrooms
bet that's true
i'll bet that is true i mean
if i had to guess from uh you know bill
maher and russell brand i'd say you know
if i had to guess probably more yes than
though
glenn greenwald
i don't know
i don't know that would be an interest
i'd love to ask him that question
i don't know
but um
fearless is very close to it so tony is
saying fearless here's the answer i was
looking for
immune from embarrassment
immune
from embarrassment
now we can't know what's in their head
right so that's a little bit mind
reading so we have to do it
observationally and say does that look
does that look right because we're just
guessing what they're thinking
but if you look at
bill maher
glenn greenwald and
russell brand
i would speculate
i don't know this for sure that they're
unusually free
from worrying about being embarrassed
has something to do with the jobs
they've chosen right if you're not
afraid of being embarrassed you can say
anything
you're free
so you don't have to worry about
covering up for that thing you used to
say to make it all sound like your ego
you know is intact and you you were
always smart even if you were dumb
they also have chosen jobs in which
proving that they have been wrong is
actually an asset
same with me
i've chosen a job if you can call
whatever this is a job sort of
i've chosen one in which if i
if i am completely wrong about something
in public like like really seriously
wrong
that's content
i would love that
i would love to find out how wrong i am
about something i've always thought was
true
because that to me is exhilarating
so am i likely to suffer cognitive
dissonance
when i'm exhilarated to find out i'm
wrong
no it's immunity
so i have the same immunity
so i'm speculating here right so
bear with me that i'm trying to
teach you a concept it may not apply to
any of these three individuals yeah i
can't read their minds
but i think that the things that give
you immunity to cognitive dissonance is
you have to be you have to learn to be
excited when you're wrong in public
excited instead of embarrassed
you have to be a little bit fearless
and it helps that you've been battered
before like it helps that you've
survived a number of shames and
embarrassments as i have
so i do think that there is a formula
for being free of cognitive dissonance
and whether these people did it
intentionally or it's just how things
turned out
you have this small group of people who
literally
doesn't seem to be affected as much
by the things that are affecting other
people now here's
now here's another one i'm going to add
to this joe rogan has a video i and i
didn't couldn't tell from the video this
is on the internet today
if
it was a trailer for a movie
or was it just a
video meme i wasn't sure what it is but
the the nature of it is
joe rogan talking on his show and
they're taking clips from it in which
he's talking about how
freedom is the the basic operating
system that makes everything work in the
united states and as soon as you
start taking freedom away that
everything falls apart like the thing
that makes us great
now what makes the video strong is that
the way he does it right his
presentation is like really impressive
and
um
here's my question for you ready here's
a fun question of the day
does it feel to you
that there's some kind of a 1776
kind of thing forming
you know what i'm talking about
remember the the founders of the country
so you had your washingtons and your
jeffersons and your hamiltons and your
and your franklins and stuff
who are those people today
it's joe rogan right
like if you have to map
uh who are who are the
like the the founders
who need to
reset the united states
because it feels like we're we need a
tuning doesn't it like we're on a tune
we're like an instrument
we're like an instrument that was really
in tune
for decades but now it's out of tune
something wrong and these get fixed
retuned
um
which
can you map
today's let's say the independent
pundits
and i'm i'm gonna take alex jones off
the list
because as awesome as alex jones is in
many ways as an entertainer etc
um i don't feel like he quite fits this
model that i'm talking about he's a
little too provocative
so i mean he's he's a special case
but could you map the current pundits
the the voices that you hear the
independent voices could you map them to
the founders
like who would be george washington
it might be joe rogan
might be joe rogan he might be george
washington
who who is uh
who is uh benjamin franklin
who is benjamin franklin
who is uh
jefferson
who is hamilton
you could almost you could almost see
that there's a thing
it's like the founders are reforming
now i have a last name which
has some historical
some historical relevance to
the revolution
um we're related but not i'm not a
descendant i think i'm you know distant
cousin or something
but
isn't it interesting that that there's
something forming that seems to be the
right counterbalance to whatever looks
like is the the tuning problem with the
country
um
and uh it's time to go to the whiteboard
now those of you on who are watching on
youtube right now
you didn't know there was going to be a
a whiteboard did you yeah yeah you would
have been twice as excited if i told you
that upfront but there's going to be a
whiteboard
people on locals already knew it because
they get a preview before you do but
here is my
hypothesis
there is a gigantic wide path open
for
a
candidate
who wants to end the division in the
country
and to bring us to let's say a new level
of uh
1776
like freedom
and
i i'm going to suggest
that there exists completely by
coincidence this is completely a
coincidence
that most of our divisive
topics
have a middle ground
that both sides would agree to
that sounds crazy doesn't it
if i told you that given that the huge
disparity in like the divisions in this
country you'd say to yourself my god
we're we're separated and it's getting
worse
remember one of the things i taught you
that sometimes you can't tell the
difference between being on the edge of
disaster and on the edge of the golden
age
they feel the same right darkest before
the dawn situation right
we have blundered into a situation just
blundered
into a situation in which
a middle of the road candidate could
satisfy everybody
and i'm going to make that case do you
think so a middle of the road candidate
and i don't know who it would be i mean
i'm not talking about a trump obviously
i'm not talking about bernie sanders
obviously
but somebody
could emerge
and let me tell you what that would look
like right
take a take the election
on the left you've got people who say
the election was fine stop complaining
and on the right
you got people who say it was a fraud
but it's also history
so how could a candidate
who wants to bring the country together
come up with a plan that makes the left
and right happy it looks like this
hey there's one thing we can agree on
the one thing we can agree on is that we
didn't agree about the last election
right
we can all agree that we didn't agree
about the last one
so let's fix the next one
and i'll make it my you know my
my main thing to have election reform
instead of rules that
guarantee the states have to do it right
they can still do things differently but
they have to
meet a certain standard of audit
auditability
right now would you vote for that
candidate the one who says you know uh
whether you think that 2020 was fair or
unfair it's also over
it's also done
so let's fix it for next time
you would immediately like that
candidate right
because because they found the middle
ground it's exactly what you wanted
let's do another one
uh how about the climate you got people
on the right say hey it's a hoax or it's
no problem but all the people on the
left is a crisis
how could you possibly integrate it's a
crisis where that's not a problem
nuclear energy
because it's the same solution whether
it's a hoax or not
you need the energy
you want clean energy clean air
so you're going to do nuclear energy as
hard as you can no matter what you don't
even have to decide if climate is real
just find the middle path and say look
i'll make both of you happy we'll just
go balls to the wall on nuclear the left
likes it biden likes it the right likes
it why are we even having a conversation
we have to do the same thing
whether climate change is
what you think it is or not it's exactly
the same path
boom
let's do another one infrastructure bill
the public just wants an infrastructure
bill according to polls
so this one's easy
just give the public what they ask for
be in favor of infrastructure only not
you know not the big one that's going to
change society overall
and not
you know and satisfy the
people who think it's just a giant power
grab by just saying it's just
infrastructure now
would you be able to get that pass
through congress i don't know but if you
ran for president on trying
you would look pretty attractive
because the public is on the same page
the public says can you just give me a
bill that's on this topic and then we'll
vote on it then we'll do the other topic
the public's already there you don't
have to convince anybody just take the
take the view
that the public already has
just adopt it
how about schools we got the right who
likes their homeschooling and having
their freedom to teach their children
the way they want without all these
social justice stuff
but then on the left you've got people
who believe in systemic
racism that's what that says down there
systemic racism
so how do you integrate them simple they
they all agree that the teachers unions
are the problems so just go after the
teachers unions the left and the right
have
different issues
but they both have the same solution
neuter the teachers unions
same solution
two different worldviews but same
solution
easy to unify
like
moronically easy to unify the country
in fact
i think it's so easy to unify the
country that we're blind to it
that we're just not that we're not
really that far on different pages we
have different views of what's going on
but weirdly the solutions are the same
no matter what you think is going on
so here's some more
[Music]
um you're worried about vaccine mandates
we're not going to talk about it i'm not
going to talk about it
i know you i know you've warned me
you're sick of vaccines i'm just saying
it's an issue
how could you bring the left and the
right together
on vaccine
mandates here's how you do it
leave it to the insurance companies
that's it
just take the government out of it
and just leave it to insurance
do you know what would happen
same thing that happens with everything
same thing that happens with every topic
insurance companies
will decide how much risk you can take
or they'll charge you for it
that's it
the obvious thing that would happen is
insurance companies would charge a
different
premium
for vaccinated versus unvaccinated
people now they probably should do
something for people who have natural
immunity
you know as well
but i'm pretty sure
that the government could just walk away
from this question
and the insurance the insurance industry
would just say well you don't have to
get vaccinated it's your body
but you do have to pay more
now do you think that that's right
doesn't matter they're going to do it
anyway
insurance companies are just going to do
the math the way they want to do it your
opinion doesn't matter
how about my opinion that i should not
have to pay more for car insurance
because just because i'm a male
because i happen to be a very safe
driver
so it's very unfair for me right
but i don't about it too much
because the insurance company did their
math
they have to provide insurance in a way
that they can make money
that's the only way they can do it
so i kind of live with it
so get the government out of the
business and let the free market decide
what we do the free market works every
time
doesn't it well that's an exaggeration
but it works often
so how about another one um healthcare
the left would like universal healthcare
the right would rather just have
competition and do what you you know
you're on your own
i feel like there's definitely a middle
ground in which we say our objective is
to get everybody insurance
we don't know how to do it
in a way that makes everybody happy so i
think there should be a poor person's
plan i've been saying this for years the
government needs a poor person plan what
would that look like
mostly it would look like removing
regulations
that now you like it don't you if i said
to you we're going to insure all the
poor people and you're going to pay for
it you're like oh i don't know
i like poor people having insurance but
i don't want to pay for it
but if i said to you
that poor people would have insurance
just by removing regulations
let me give you an example
uh the regulation against um tele
telehealth over the phone across borders
just get rid of that
then suddenly you have all kinds of
competition for doctors because they can
do it over the phone
now there's still a physical
manipulation part somebody has to give
you the shot or put on the band-aid or
set the bone or whatever it is so you
still need people in person
so you make one other
regulatory change
the regulatory change is that maybe
nurse practitioners or nurses
can do a lot of the physical stuff
that's maybe a little bit more than they
did before
maybe while the doctor is also still on
the phone i mean you could work it out
but it seems to me
that if you made use of let's say excess
capacity
which is let's say getting an mri at
midnight
do you think that the demand for mris at
midnight
is the same as it is during the day
probably not so if you're a poorer
person maybe you've got to get to 2 a.m
2 a.m mri
and you pay way way less
so the point is
a
a middle-of-the-road candidate has all
the space in the world
to create solutions that the left and
right go hey
that's not bad
now i don't know that there's any
candidate who could pull this off i
don't think that this stuff is
compatible with the left or the right i
feel like a republican could pull it off
better
am i wrong
i feel like i feel like this is a little
bit more
rustic what are you talking about
it says scott please stop
stop what
you got to do better than please stop
really
you really have to do better than that
just up your game a little bit just give
me
a little taste
of what you don't like about it just
anything
all right
so that
is that
california dismissed 124 000 marijuana
convictions or they will after this
latest batch
124 000 californians
had their lives ruined
because they smoked some marijuana and
got caught they probably were small
dealers too but
this is good news
124 000 people just got their life back
that's really big
so california does some things right
cnn had a report
that says that uh
misinformation
gets six times more clicks at least on
facebook
than real information so misinformation
gets six times more clicks
big problem huh
and then they went further and said this
60 68 of far right posts are
misinformation
and 36 percent of misinformation is on
the left
so two-thirds of misinformation
comes from the far right
do you believe that
two-thirds of misinformation comes from
the far right
according to the cnn according to some
study about facebook
how does that
now try to let imagine that's true
assume it's true the 68 of the far right
posts are misinformation how does that
jibe
with what bill maher was just recently
talking about
that people on the right are far better
informed about the risks
of
covid
how do how does that how can it be true
that 68 of the far right posts are
misinformation but the far right is far
more informed better informed
explain those two facts
uh somebody says probably the opposite
okay maybe the date is just wrong that's
possible
um
but how could this both be true
do you know how it could both be true
the conservatives don't believe
everything they click
right
so if you're talking about what they
clicked
the conservatives are clicking like
crazy on false information
but apparently they're not believing it
because in the end they have better
information after looking at six times
well after looking at way more
misinformation
they still have
a clearer idea of what's happening
does that mean that they're filtering it
better
or
or
is it that it's only a small number of
the conservatives who are doing all of
the clicking
it could be that there's like a small
active group of far-right people who are
just doing tons of clicking and it
doesn't really affect the average that
much
that's probably what's going on
so very misleading report
surprise from cnn
i saw a tweet from daniel buck
on twitter
and i don't know if these numbers are
right but so i guess that's question
number one are these numbers right
says that the average yearly
homeschooling cost for homeschooling is
seven hundred to eighteen hundred
dollars per student
now obviously that doesn't cost the you
know count the time of the parents etc
but uh average public school cost ten
thousand to fifteen thousand per student
so
you know like ten times as much
for uh
uh
for public school so he says imagine
what would happen if you use that money
for homeschooling now i don't think it's
quite that clean right you know that
comparison's
kind of ugly but i would add this to
that equation
a hundred percent of the mental and
emotional problems of children
come from their classmates
a hundred percent of the emotional and
mental problems of kids and they're
fairly extreme
the mental problems of kids today come
from their classmates
they're classmates
do you do you know any teenagers ask
them what's bothering them
it's their classmates you know sometimes
a teacher but that's like one percent
it's like almost entirely
bullies
and bad behavior
now
the home the homeschool kids don't get
much of that do they they don't get the
continuous bullying and criticism and
you know attacks on your self-esteem and
everything else and
let me ask you this
if i said you're going to go to an
environment you have to go there there's
no choice you have no freedom you have
to go to this environment where 20 of
the people will be just
awful
they'll just be bullies they'll be
they'll be destroying you you can have
ptsd when it's done
would you go to that environment
if you knew that 20 of the people were
gonna just wreck you
no you would never do that voluntarily
but that's what school is
school is a guarantee that 20 of your
classmates are just monsters
they're just literally just
monsters
and every kid is being destroyed by
these you know 20 it might be more it
could be 50
of monsters
every class
every kid in every class is being
destroyed by bullies
because once you have social media it's
like a weapon of mass destruction you
can bully people in a massive pervasive
way
so
i would say that the whole idea of
sending people to school with their
peers is broken because social media
broke it
let me say that again social media made
public school
a nightmare
and it probably needs to be just
eliminated probably need to get rid of
public schools or get rid of social
media but that's not going to happen so
almost certainly we have to get kids out
of that environment because social media
plus public school
equals mental destruction of kids
really serious mental destruction i'm
not talking about annoyances
i'm not talking about oh
the little little angela is unhappy
today because somebody said something
bad i'm talking about people being
destroyed
i mean your lives just destroyed
just going to school it's because of
social media plus school they just can't
be impaired you can't put
a weapon of mass destruction in a
child's hand and that's what we did with
social media it's a weapon of mass
destruction
you know usually applied one person at a
time
but we we basically are arming children
with the most dangerous you know mental
weapons you could ever have and we're
like oh okay let's arm these children
and walk away this should be fine
all right
um
i'm going to ask a question
which some of you will turn off this
feed
and but but if you but if you if you uh
stick with me for a moment i think
you're going to find it
more interesting than you thought all
right
so i don't like to do your standard uh
get vaccinated don't give vaccinated
animals you know you can make up your
own decision
but there are questions about these the
uh statistics of it
that are unanswered
and here's the the one that's bothering
me
and the reason it bothers me is my
opinion
so watch what i do now all right so i
talked about people who can um
be free of or at least immune to
cognitive dissonance
this is how you do it
by questioning your own opinion
right if you can question your own
opinion both privately and in public
you're a little bit more immune to
cognitive dissonance because then if
something happens and it shows your
opinion is wrong
then then
then you say well i told you it might be
wrong
so you don't have any trigger for
cognitive dissonance because you've
allowed you could be wrong
so
here's something that i thought was true
that i'm rethinking i think i might be
wrong and i need you to help me here
okay so i'm going to ask you a question
well let me start with a a primer
i believe that your opinion on
vaccinations in my opinion on
vaccinations are both guesses
we believe that we have looked at
statistics and facts and
we've looked at the odds and we've
looked at our own core morbidities and
we made our decisions do you think
that's what happened
because i don't i think we both guessed
and here's specifically what we guessed
on
the risk
of a vaccine after the first few months
now historically
if you had a vaccination that
was safe for the first few months in
other words we couldn't find
a massive unidentified side effect
for the first few months you were pretty
good
you know the the odds of ever finding
one then become almost zero
historically
historically
with different vaccinations
with different technology
we knew that if you waited x months and
you didn't see anything you were fine
why does that apply to a new vaccine
why can i use the experience with
completely different vaccinations
to make a decision about this one that's
brand new
and hasn't been around for years
now
suppose it's true that every
let's just i don't know if this is true
but let's let's say it's true that every
vaccination for the last 30 years
we we had the experience that if it
didn't give you problems in the first
few months you were safe
statistically speaking
but why would that be true of every new
vaccine especially if it's a new
technology
why is it that our experience with other
vaccines which are
other vaccines
why does that tell us what's going to
happen with this one
just because they all went a certain way
before
but this isn't those
is it
you know saying that your next vaccine
will operate like the last one knowing
it's a completely different technology
isn't that exactly like
saying that trump would be just like
other presidents
every president we elect is sort of the
same
every time we get a president they move
to the middle
they're sort of the same as every other
president
but then trump comes along
didn't see that coming did he
right why is it
that i believe that um and this is the
part i'm questioning why is it that i
believe
that the history of other vaccines
tells me i'm safe with this one
how is that logical that's my opinion
i'm telling you my opinion doesn't make
sense to me
right
tell me i'm wrong
that's my opinion and it doesn't even
make sense to me
because there's no connection between
those other vaccinations
and the one i got
right
so i would love to hear a
question for dr drew question for any of
the doctors who have more insight on
this
what logical connection can i make
between this new vaccine and others and
why why would i expect this experience
to be the same as that
now here's the other thing you don't
know
long haul
so you don't know what the long-haul
risk is
and you don't know what the long-haul
risk is if you can call it that from the
vaccination itself
and yet you and i
having no information whatsoever about
the main risks
have come to these like solid decisions
about what to do if you're not
questioning your decision
you should be
well let me ask you this question
whichever way you went
how many of you are 100 sure you made
the right choice
no matter which way you went vaccinated
or unvaccinated in the comments
how many of you are a hundred percent
sure
i'm looking at the comments all right
i'm saying mostly no but there are fewer
or 100 sure
90
seems like uh
you know
that's where you should be i think
yeah
a lot of 100 percenters
more than you think
maybe i don't know it's not scientific
or anything but i'm seeing a lot of uh
100 percenters
i don't think that's a rational um
opinion
so i think that whether you whether
you're pro or anti-vaccination the 100
percenters are the ones that have the
wrong opinion now
um
let me adjust that a little bit
if you have some strange comorbidities
or you're eight years old
maybe maybe you're closer to 100
but for people in the middle
now let's take me specifically
if i were to decide to get vaccinated or
not
i would have to calculate my odds how do
i calculate my odds
can't do it
right i can't calculate my odds i can
calculate the odds of somebody in my age
group but that's not me
do my odds apply to anybody in my age
group
how many people who are 64
are as fit as i am and have my body mass
index
not a lot
so what is the risk for people with my
body mass index who are also 64.
who knows
i also have a comorbidity asthma
asthma is on the list of the bad
comorbidities
so therefore i'd say oh okay that i'm a
risky situation
but
one of the medications
that seems to have a high uh
effectiveness for covent is one that i
take for asthma
the buddha night or whatever the hell it
is i forget the name of it but there's
an asthma meds that seems to help
against covet
so if i have asthma but i'm also doing
that those medications that may or may
not help against govid
and i'm thin but i'm old
what is my risk
no idea
no idea
so if you're looking at your own
personal risk and say okay in my
specific case
i've got this kind of risk
and then you know there's this much
long-haul risk and there's this much
long-term vaccination risk these are all
unknowns
you don't know your personal risk you
might think you do but you don't you
know you don't know your dna and how
that affects
things et cetera
you don't know your ace2 inhibitors
you don't know that stuff
right
so
to imagine that we're making rational
decisions
is not i don't feel like we are
so here's why and let me tell you where
this all started i i was accused of
having contempt
for my own viewers
and i'll bet that's not i'll bet that
wasn't just one person who thought that
i'll be how many of you think that how
many of you
think that i've shown contempt
for my audience
i'm just looking at your comments for a
moment
because i think there's good i think
some of you could say yes
sometimes
no mostly now
but seen a few yeses and here's what i
was thinking
i can't have contempt for your guess
when i know mine is a gas
let me say that again
it wouldn't be rational and i don't know
how i would generate
contempt
for an opinion which is just a guess
when my opinion is just a guess
why is my guest superior to your guess
and and by the way my guess is just
about me
my guess isn't even about you i don't
have an opinion about whether you should
get vaccinated i don't have an opinion
about me
so
i would say that we should all take a
little uh
a little helping of humility
if you think you can calculate your
personal odds you can't
and if you think you can calculate the
odds of the vaccine being a danger you
can't
and if you think you can calculate the
long-haul coven risk you can't
you can't
so we're all guessing
and you you know i see jay you're
calling in an educated guess
is it
i mean is it
because how educated are you about the
long long term risk of this vaccination
you couldn't be because nobody knows
that
all right
so definitely
i can tell you with certainty that
whatever my internal process is it
doesn't feel anything like contempt and
let me say even more
clearly there is no way i could ever
generate a feeling like contempt
for subscribers on locals
people who are literally paying their
money
for my content
there's no way under any scenario i'm
going to feel contempt about that group
of people
yeah how would you even generate that
feeling
like i know what contempt feels like it
i don't know how you would possibly have
that feeling no matter what they said
right if somebody's paying paying for my
association
like i'm automatically on your team
you know i'm good with you
all right um
but then you felt pressure to justify
your decision
explain my decision did i
yeah i i think that's a fair comment it
sounds like um i just i tried to justify
my decisions by explaining it but i
think in the end
the cleanest way to to express
what's happening is that
we're all guessing
all right let me tell you what you
missed on locals if you are not a local
subscriber here are the micro lessons
that i've added uh my lesson just put
this on here on how to pay attention
how to focus if you're having focus
problems
how to make yourself happier how to
teach with motivation how to use funny
words how to
find a mentor how to
wake up on time how to give criticism
the power of praise they're about 150 of
them
about 150 micro lessons they're all
two to five minutes each one would give
you a new skill
for five to seven dollars a month
depending on whether you have the annual
subscription and so what i try to do
is give you more than seven dollars
worth of value every month and ideally
thousands of dollars worth of value in
terms of what it does for your life
and that is my show for today best one
ever i think so
i think you'd agree
just keep getting better
and i will talk to you tomorrow i gotta
go do some stuff
