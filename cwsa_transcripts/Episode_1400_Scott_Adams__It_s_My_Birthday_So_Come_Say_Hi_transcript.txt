birthdays are
often publicized and so i looked up a
list of
famous people to see whose birthdays
are shared with me so
um here's the list of famous people who
share my birthday and
being you know very famous like i am i'm
probably pretty close to the top of this
list wouldn't you think
well let's look at this you got kanye

gabriel giffords rob paladis
where am i on this list there are a lot
of famous people with his birthday come
on
come on fifty hundred well apparently
i'm not in the top hundred
but someday i'll make it to the top
hundred birthdays
on my own birthday would you like to
enjoy
the simultaneous sip special birthday
edition
yeah of course you would and all you
need is a
copper mango or a glass of tango chalice
to style the canteens you have a glass
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee thank you
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dope ahead of the day dopamine the
other day
the thing that makes everything better
is called the simultaneous step and it
happens now go
oh just right how do you like that
sip of coffee when the temperature is
just right
it's perfect really let's talk about all
the things
that are coming so i watch with
fascination
as the evolution toward self-driving
cars
and thank you everybody for the birthday
wishes so there's a company called
cruz that is pretty far along as a
subsidiary of general motors
they've got a self-driving car that has
just got permitted
to operate in california
an actual self-driving car and what's
different is this one doesn't require an
operator
a human operator to take the controls if
something goes wrong
so until now we did have self-driving
cars but it required a human
to be in the passenger seat to take over
and it looks like this is the first one
that's made the next step
and it will be driving literally
autonomously
there will be no human there the car
will just pull up you get in and go
somewhere
now i don't know if i would be the first
one to get in this
the fly lady well you're you're much too
nice
thank you um i don't deserve that
literally
but thank you and i've been watching
this driverless car thing and what's
interesting is there's a whole bunch of
companies
that are getting into it and one assumes
that someday
i don't know apple and google will have
a car whatever
but it's not going to be like one day
they're self-driving cars
it's more like one day you'll you'll
drive past one and you'll think
what the hell was that a car with nobody
in it
and then there'll just be more of them
but one of the questions that
i wonder about is what's it like to be a
human
driver on the highway with some
self-driving cars and some human driven
cars
because correct me if i'm wrong but
isn't a big part of driving
anticipating what the other driver will
do
when you come to a stop at let's say a
four-way stop
don't you look at the faces of the
drivers
that's one of your biggest variables
right you look at their faces
because if their face is looking at you
you know they saw you
if their face is looking the other
direction and they're inching forward
you stop because you're not looking at
the car
you're looking at the face what does a
self-driving car do
self-driving cars don't look at faces so
they've got one disadvantage that humans
don't have but also i can't look at the
face of a self-driving car
how long will it take me to learn when
the self-driving car
recognizes me because i want the
self-driving car to see me
and i want to know that they see me like
a human
so what do you do it's almost like the
self-driving cars need another
some kind of other option so you can
know that they recognize you
for example uh could there be another
light
or maybe something that shows up in your
car something that tells you
that this other car now has a full
understanding of your existence
and what you're doing as long as i know
the other cars knows what i'm up to
i'm okay but until i know it knows where
i am and what i'm doing
i don't know it'd be hard to trust it
you know i mentioned this the other day
but it's becoming more and more
hardened as a reality there will be
two histories of the pandemic one
history will say hey there was a big old
pandemic
the other history is what
some members of the right are forming
into their own reality which is the
pandemic didn't happen
there was none it was just an illusion
that actually nothing happened there was
a virus and the virus
was real and people got it and people
died so that part is not in question
what's question is is anything unusual
did anything unusual happen in terms of
viruses
or was the unusual thing only the way we
reacted to this one
and we're just going to have to live
with two realities
we will have two completely different
histories
one in which the virus never happened as
a as a pandemic
but it happened as a normal little extra
aggressive seasonal virus
that we we overreacted to
how many of you buy into the opinion
that the pandemic was largely
an illusion and no not really much worse
than a normal flu how many of you buy
into that
i just want to see in your comments if
that's becoming a popular view
or not i'm seeing a yes thumbs up
i see scam no overreacted yes
yes yes yes me me me
no no no no well so you see there it is
there are roughly as many people who
think the pandemic
didn't exist as there are who think they
live through one
how do you how do you reconcile two
histories that are opposites
and we both live through it right it's
not like we're talking about something
that
was hypothetical and it's in our history
books
you and i and everyone watching this
right now
we just we're in it still we're living
through it in real time
and still a large segment of the
population thinks
it isn't real didn't happen
well i'm in the camp that says something
happened and some
people were dying and whether we over
counted them or not it's still in the
millions
yeah i'm fairly certain it's in the
millions was it worth it well we'll
figure that out as we go
um there's a a survey a study
i don't know if you call this study
let's call this survey
because that's what it is a survey about
uh whether more people got the covet
when they were wearing masks or not
wearing masks this is from axios
ipsos pole and what do you think if you
haven't seen
for those of you who have not seen it
yet so don't don't ruin it yet so many
of you have not seen the results
so they did a poll and they said how
much did you wear masks
and then did you get coronavirus and
they determined
and i won't tell you the answer yet but
what do you think what do you what do
you think was the result
did the people who wore the masks more
often
get fewer infections or more of them or
the same
in the comments tell me what you think
it turned out
i see somebody says the same no
difference
no effect no less likely to get sick
same no difference so most of you have
not seen this
this survey obviously same blah blah
blah
fewer here's the answer gigantic
difference
which way did it go there was a doubling
so one of those conditions either
wearing a mask or not wearing masks
one of those two conditions doubled your
risk of getting an infection
doubled all right so we're not talking
about a small difference
doubled which was it was the people who
wore the masks
who were safer or was it the people who
didn't wear masks
who were safer what do you think
because there are a lot of people who
think the masks are causing problems
right
the answer is according to the ipsos
axios
poll that people who did not regularly
wear masks had
twice the infections
the people who didn't wear masks
were twice as likely to be
infected based on self-reporting right
now thank you
in the comments somebody says this is
not a gold standard of reporting
or a gold standard study no it's not
even a study
it's it's more like a poll i would call
it a poll not a study
so this does not pass scientific
rigor can we all agree on that there's
nobody thinks that this passes any kind
of scientific
gold standard right so the fact that
there's this one
survey that does show a really big
difference though
here's where i would be more skeptical
if the mask indifference showed a
difference of say
10 or 20 let's say hypothetically
i'd say to myself i don't know that you
can measure that really
ten to twenty percent sounds like i
don't know
that's too small of a hypothetical
difference
to be sure there weren't other variables
in there mucking up your result
so ten to twenty percent i would have
said uh that doesn't tell us anything
but what if it's double
well you know let's let's just say
hypothetically
let's say the polling was done well it's
still not a scientific study it's not a
gold standard
controlled anything but double
all right when i do a twitter poll
i know it's highly unscientific it's as
unscientific as you can get
because you know my followers are not
even close to any kind of a random
sample
and still if i run a twitter poll and
it's the the results are ten to one in
one direction
i still think it means something it just
isn't scientific
but if it's you know 10 chance obviously
it means nothing
i don't know i would say this is not
conclusive
or close to it but um it certainly
agrees with my opinion
and the best way to know that something
is true
is if it agrees with your your prior
opinion
now that's the standard i use so this
agrees with what i already thought to be
true which is
mass are more likely to work than not
one of the obvious problems with this
is that people don't wear masks for the
same reasons
and risks are different and you know one
of the reasons you white
might wear masks a lot is because you
perceive a risk etcetera etcetera
etcetera so there's a million
million problems wrong with the poll but
i'll bet it will hold up if i had to bet
let me put it into money if somebody
said to you scott
you can't avoid making this bet we'll
kill you if you don't participate
so you have to participate and you have
to put all of your money
on whether masks made a difference
or they didn't i would bet all of my
money that it made a difference
i bet all of it now this is under the
assumption that i had to bet one way or
the other
i would prefer not betting because i'm
not that confident
you know i i'd need something like 99
confidence to bet everything i have but
in this hypothetical where i had to bet
yeah i would bet that they work now
i'm also am i am i
unbiased nope
because i have committed to a position
early on in the pandemic
do you remember early on when the
experts were saying masks
don't work and i believe and by the way
i would love a fact check on this if
there's anybody who can give me a fact
check
i believe but i can't confirm it yet
that i'm the first public figure to call
on fauci et cetera saying that mass
don't work now given that i've made such
a public
commitment to that view that masks
almost certainly work this was my view
early on before we had data
it just seems logically that they would
given that i made that commitment
i am no longer able to be objective when
i look at say a result
like this poll because i want it to
agree with me
right who doesn't want to be right on
their birthday
everybody wants to be right especially
on their birthday
so you should not take me as a credible
source
when i tell you hey this poll looks uh
pretty credible
because i want it to be true i want it
to be true because that makes me feel
good
and me look good so i have no
credibility
on this question you get that right that
doesn't mean i'm wrong
i actually think i'm right but in terms
of you
judging my credibility on this question
it should be zero
because i've set up the perfect
condition for cognitive dissonance
i set myself up for that by by taking a
public stand
and putting my reputation behind it and
it's a big question right
it's not a trivial question if it were
trivial i'd say ah who cares
but it's big people may have lived or
died
literally lived or died on the question
of whether they believed mass worked or
didn't
may have right that's unclear at this
point
so yeah you should not believe me on
that topic but i'll report what
what i see on the topic i i will report
it if it says mass don't work
if there's a big study that disagrees
with me
i'm not going to like it but
i promise you i'll report it so you've
heard it that's the best i can do
um you know i've been reading a lot
about china lately
you got a fentanyl problem a uyghur
genocide problem
they've got a stealing ip problem
maybe not not too forthcoming on the
virus and
you know when you put it all together
i'm starting to think that china doesn't
have our best interests in mind
alright moving on um
cnn reports that uh i guess now we have
a recording of a 2019 phone call
in which rudy giuliani was according to
the cnn headline
this is how they said it rudy giuliani
cajoled and pressured ukraine to
investigate
baseless conspiracies about biden
now the reporting on this is very
interesting because it suggests
that cnn knows how investigations turn
out
before they're started is this a pattern
well yes it is it is because it turns
out
that cnn has done this with the election
audits
cnn is already reporting the result of
the audit that didn't happen yet
or at least it's not complete yet this
is really happening right in front of
you
cnn is telling you the outcome of an
audit
before the audit's over and people are
just accepting that
we're they're accepting it as if that
makes any sense
now it would certainly be fair for them
to say based on everything we've seen
and reported
we're not expecting that the audit will
come up with any surprises
that's fair that's fair completely fair
based on everything we've seen and
reported so far
we have no reason to believe that the
audit will kick up some surprises
i would say that's fine but when you say
it's baseless
you're kind of suggesting you know how
it's going to turn out
and you don't they did i would say
similar things with russia and collusion
there was a obviously the mueller
investigation was ongoing
but it seems to me that cnn reported it
as a fact all along
before it was done and now this ukraine
investigation that never happened
but somehow cnn knows what the result
would be
for the investigation that never
happened
so these are three clear i think clear
examples
of where cnn knew the result of an
investigation
before the investigation
how did they even remain as a tv network
they are so far into ridiculousness now
let me ask you this
am i biased in favor of fox news
or is it true that fox news doesn't do
this
now i'm not saying that fox news doesn't
do their own
stuff you can criticize right so we're
not saying
fox news good cnn bad that's not what
i'm saying
but i'm saying this specific trick where
they know the outcome of something
before the
end isn't that only cnn
i don't know if ms nbc does it but i i
can't remember any time
that fox news has ever told us the
outcome of a
study before the study was over have you
do you have any memory of that
this seems to be specific to cnn
here's a scary story but fun
turns out that criminal organizations
mafia types have been using an
encryption
technology in which you would take a
phone
that had been crippled for all other
purposes except for
this one encrypted app and it could only
talk
to people who also had a crippled phone
with just that app on it
so it was like a really special super
secret encrypted thing that's better
than you know telegram
it's better than better than signal it's
better than whatsapp
because those are just you know
encryption apps
but this one you had to have an actual
special phone
that could only talk to the other
special phones pretty well encrypted
right
except law enforcement has had that
encryption broken for a long time
and they've been watching the entire
criminal enterprises
revealing all of their secrets for for a
long time
until they just did a big roll up and
arrested a bunch of people
but here's my here's my advice to you
there's no such thing as an encrypted
app
now technically they're encrypted in the
sense that
encryption happens in a in a you know
math and coding sense yes
betsy you skied in my hometown i'll be
damned you've seen my house
if you were on the ski slope in windham
new york you saw my house
because you just looked across the
valley and there it was
but here's the thing
here's why there's no such thing as a
safely
encrypted app my goodness eugene gian
you are way too nice i certainly
appreciate it but
i'm not worth it and
but i appreciate it very much so there's
no such thing as a really encrypted app
uh and here's why your encrypted app
ends up with a human being that's why
you sent it right
you sent your message to a human being
the human being isn't encrypted right
as soon as the human being gets it it's
no longer a secret message
it's a message that some damn person
could tell anybody they want
so the moment you think well i'm safe
now
i got my encrypted app
no such thing i used to have the
signal app got rid of it
because the moment you think your
messages are secret
you're there's no such thing as a
secret message
that doesn't exist because the person on
the other end
is not encrypted and
let me point out this those companies
signal telegram
whatsapp don't they have human beings
working there
do you think there's no way to get an
insider
to figure out how to beat an encryption
actually i don't know the answer to that
question it might be that there is no
way
but i doubt it i would think that if you
could get an insider who had the right
skills the right access
they could open up any app how do you
know the insiders haven't already gone
to the
developers for whatever app you're using
and said to them
here's the deal if you don't give us a
back door to your encrypted app
we will shut your operation down one way
or another
we'll do it legally but you're basically
out of business unless you give us a
back door
did that happen how would you know
how would you know is there any way you
would know
that your app developer had a secret
conversation with the fbi
no no you'd have no way of knowing so
you would be a sucker to use encrypted
apps
you would be a sucker because an
encrypted app is exactly where people
are going to look for your secrets
now it might not be that your neighbor
can read your encrypted app
but your neighbor wasn't reading your
other mail either
i mean your neighbor wasn't getting into
your your your text messages
so you only have two kinds of people the
people who can't get into your messages
at all
or don't care and the people like the
government
who really do want to see your messages
and they can do it
right so this
this example of the mafia super secret
encryption
being easily i don't know if it was
easily but they did crack it that should
tell you
everything you need to know about secret
information
don't write anything down in any form
if it's bad don't ever write
incriminating things
at all ever don't write anything
encrypted
uh or that's private and would get you
in trouble
all right uh in a related story
and i'm not sure what to think about
this yet but did you hear
that the uh fbi managed to
somehow get back the ransomware that was
paid for the colonial pipeline
uh hack is that still true
i mean i heard that yesterday but it
looks like it wasn't in the news this
morning
did something happen to the story can
somebody confirm that that happened
is it true that the fbi somehow
clawed back the i think it was bitcoin
and somehow
clawed back that money that was paid can
i get a confirmation on that
partially some of it not all of it
somebody says
well probably because some of it already
had passed through to another wallet
they got a portion of it somebody's
saying okay
now you might ask yourself hey i thought
the whole point of
uh bitcoin and cryptocurrency is that
is that it was secret so how did the fbi
get a hold of the secret passcode the
secret code that led him into the wallet
of the bad guys to take their money out
how'd they get it
because these crypto things are supposed
to be
all secret and secure right it's why
criminals use them
how secure is bitcoin well here's the
problem
apparently there's a history of the fbi
hackers hacking hackers
so in other words if you had already
known you had a hacker group
you might not be able to get directly
into their bitcoin business
but you can control their network so
that everything they do
you can see in theory right we don't
know if this happened in this case
but in theory you could hack their whole
network and anything they did
including typing in a bitcoin password
might be known so you don't need to
penetrate
the bitcoin itself you know the the
blockchain etc you don't need to
penetrate that
that still might be secure but
you might be able to get their entire
network
and then catch them when they're typing
in their passcode or something
now i think that's the thing right can
somebody who's a little more
technically astute tell me the answer is
if you could control somebody's computer
such that you can see every keystroke
couldn't you get their passcode
i mean i think you could right so yeah a
key logger is what it's called a key
logger
so if the good guys hacked the bad guys
they could certainly get a hold of their
passcode and then empty their wallets
don't know if that's what happened could
have been an insider
could have been something else i don't
know i doubt they've penetrated
the blockchain in some way that they
could get a hold of
i don't think it's possible to to do it
directly i think they would have to go
after the
the people not the the technology
all right um key loggers are easy to
find yeah
you would think a high-end hackers would
be protecting themselves from being
hacked
so i doubt it's as simple as a key
logger but that's the basic idea
they left it on coinbase which is dumb
but being on coinbase doesn't
automatically
give somebody a backdoor into it you
know that alone wouldn't make a
difference
um all right vice president
uh harris made the mistake of trying to
speak in public
vice president harrison harris speaks in
public
as well as joe biden climbs stairs in
public
in either case it's an adventure and
you're probably a little nervous when
you see it if you're a supporter
and one of the stories that we hear is
that she's quietly receiving what's
called
media training in other words
and by the way did i ever tell you that
this was would happen
i told you that sooner or later somebody
was going to be
training harris and how to talk in
public
because she does not know how to talk in
public her biggest problem is her
nervous giggle it's a really big problem
and i don't know how hard it is to teach
somebody not to do that if it's a
lifelong habit
but man if she doesn't beat that i don't
know how she could ever be president
but she did a interview with lester holt
in which he was asking her about having
not visited the border
and she said glibly
but i also haven't been to europe so
what's your point
what somebody gave her media training
and she answered that way
but i also haven't been to europe so
what's your point
oh my god i don't know how you
could be any worse
now first of all i assume that she means
she's been to europe
personally but not on official business
so it wasn't like she's never been to
europe i assume
i mean that was my interpretation of it
but
you need to answer that question
directly right
that was a fair question why haven't you
been to the border a completely fair
question
it is also a question you know you're
going to be asked
fox news reports the number of days she
hasn't
visited the border every day the number
of days she hasn't visited the border is
reported in national news
she knew the question was coming and she
wasn't ready for it
are you kidding me she wasn't ready for
the most obvious question about her job
i mean that's just really bad work
that's somebody who doesn't look like
they did the homework
at all i mean you can't even say
she tried hard but failed this doesn't
look like trying
at all this looks like literally being
absent from your duties
if you can't answer a simple question
like that
so the direct answer would have been
this uh i would like to
uh here here let me give you the correct
media
answer okay uh vice president harris
people are concerned that you haven't
visited the border and yet you're in
charge of making sure central america
doesn't send more people across the
border don't you think you should visit
the border
here's the correct answer i think it's
very important that everybody
you know visits the border who's
involved in the decision making
so yes i'm definitely going to visit the
border but in terms of priorities
my first priority is specifically
working with these countries
to make sure that there's less problem
on the border in the first place but
yeah absolutely i'll visit the border
we just need to work that into the
schedule at the moment frankly
you know we have enough reporting from
the border that i know what's going on
there
but i do think that for the benefit of
the public the public needs to see me
there so
i'm with you and as soon as i get done
with this stuff
we're going to schedule a trip to the
border and i'd like to see it firsthand
but we do have good reporting on it
compare my answer to
i haven't been to europe either
i mean seriously how bad a politician
can you be to not be able to answer
the most obvious question you'll ever be
asked
all right
ron desantis continues to do almost
everything right
for somebody who's likely to run for
president
i mean whoever is invit whoever is
advising
ron desantis assuming that this isn't
him making up
all of his own decisions maybe it is i
don't know but
he really is doing one right thing after
another it's kind of crazy
so the latest right thing he did in
terms of running for president
if that's his ambition is he's going
after china
from the perspective of a governor
which is really smart because i don't
know who else has done this has anybody
done this
as directly so he's done i guess uh
he's blaming the chinese government for
the virus and the way they handled it so
that's
a plus but that you know that's a little
bit more ordinary other people are doing
that
but then he just he just decided
well he just passed some laws i guess or
he's promoting a bill
that would ban partnerships between the
chinese government
and any educational entity in florida
so there's something called the
confucius institute
which quote facilitates cultural
exchanges
and direct deals between foreign
governments and florida's universities
and colleges
and desantis is saying how about china
get out of florida
yes that is the correct approach
yes ron desantis you are 100
on the right page here 100 not just
politically because
it's brilliant politically because it
raises his stature to your national
leader
um but it's also exactly the right thing
to do there's no
this one's not ambiguous at all this is
exactly the right thing to do
and then also he there's a second bill
so these are bills these are not laws
yet the second bill that would make
theft and trafficking of trade secrets a
criminal offense
under state law they're already
federally federally as a crime but he's
tightening up and making the estate
crime as well
and that of course is aimed uh more at
china than anybody else
so by ron desantis packaging up you know
some anti-china chinese government
really
we don't want to say it's about chinese
people we love the chinese people
not the government it's just brilliant
politically so i'm glad that i have
desantis to talk about because
i like to talk about good and bad
persuasion and he's doing it great
doing great um
obama's in the news and i have a big
question about him
so i guess he's got a book coming out so
he's doing some interviews
and he repeated the fine people hoax
and i'm
i'm a little surprised by it now i can
imagine
it's easy to imagine that in the past
that all the democratic figures
had repeated that hoax because i think a
lot of them believed it
in the beginning but do we believe and i
asked i asked this
in a poll i said do you think barack
obama believes the fine people hoax
is actually real as as recently as
yesterday
could somebody as well informed as obama
not know that that's a hoax by now
certainly i would forgive anybody who
didn't know it was a hoax in the
beginning
but now how do you not know that now
you know even biden stopped saying it we
haven't heard biden say it in quite a
while because i think he finally got the
message
it wasn't real but obama does he still
believe it
or is he morally empty
which is it because i actually don't
know
i'm actually a little confused because
it seems to me that especially from the
perspective of an ex-president
i don't have a memory of obama
telling lies this big that are so
disprovable
in public has it can somebody
remind me of any big lies that um obama
told there were just obvious lies
now of course they all do spin right you
know so i'm not talking about
spin or a little bit of hyperbole
something's worse than something can
somebody give me
well that was a promise somebody says
you know you can
the the promise about if you like your
doctor you can keep it
my guess is that he actually believed
that
i don't think he would say it i mean my
guess is that that wasn't a lie
he actually believed it but that's a
guess
yeah that's more of a campaign promise
isn't it yeah and i'm not sure that just
being wrong is the same
uh the tree fun well
i don't want to get into trayvon martin
yeah so
we don't really have a big history of
obama saying things that are this
obviously
provably false you know it'd be one
thing to say something that you can't
prove one way or the other
or or the statistics are misleading you
can read it this way or you could read
it that way
that's one thing but when has obama just
said
a obviously false thing that you can
just look up yourself until it's false
yeah so i have
my guess is that he actually believes it
that's my best guess i can't read his
mind
but i think he actually believes it
amazing he also said that it was
laughable because he literally laughed
he quote chuckled when he talks about
republicans thinking that critical race
theory and the teaching of it
is the greatest threat to our republic
now of course he's exaggerating a little
bit
but he's acting as though republicans
think critical race theory is the
biggest threat to our republic
is that is that crazy
is it crazy for somebody to think that
critical race theory
is in fact the biggest risk to the
republic
because i think you can make that
argument you could definitely make that
argument
it goes like this the the most important
thing that holds the country together
is if you're not a dictatorship
the most important thing that holds the
country together is
the culture the the set of beliefs
that everybody shares if you get these
set of beliefs wrong
that everybody shares about who you are
and what your country is about
then the whole thing falls apart
critical race theory attacks the central
premise of america
that we're a melting pot and that we
shouldn't be
obsessing over people's race and
anything else so i would say that the
dna of america which is we don't
obsessively focus on race
we try to ignore it while still also
doing everything that
the legal system and good people can do
to eliminate
bias and bigotry and uh prejudice and
all that
um so yeah you work hard to eliminate it
but you don't say this is who you are
you don't change your identity to a
bunch of who hate each other
keep the melting pot so i would say that
to obama i don't think you
understand what holds the country
together
it's a shared set of beliefs that's it
you get rid of the shared set of beliefs
and there's nothing that hold that would
hold the country together
at all you know the constitution won't
do it
the laws won't do it the military won't
do it
the political system won't do it you got
to start with that or nothing works
so he is looking to um erase the
the dna of the country and i've got to
think that is the biggest risk to the
country
um and it's hard to imagine he doesn't
see that
rasmussen reports that only 42 percent
of moderates
think fauci was telling the truth about
the gain of function
funding in wuhan now i tell you only
what the moderates think
because i don't have to tell you what
the left thinks or the right things
would you be surprised to know that the
people who identify as the left
largely believe that fauci is telling
the truth would you be surprised to know
that people who identify with the right
largely
believe that he's lying so i just look
at the moderates and if the
if you lose the moderates well you lost
the argument
and the moderates only 42 percent
believe him so even the moderates have
left
at this point now i my view on dr fauci
is a little bit more nuanced
which is there may in fact have been
some cover your ass
activity going on here but that doesn't
mean
that they're guilty of something wrong
you could cover your ass
even if you didn't do anything wrong and
you could you could
rightly be blamed for recovering your
ass and
there are two reasons to cover your ass
one is that you're guilty and you don't
want people to find out
and the other is that you're not guilty
and you don't want to be unreasonably
blamed for something so you cover your
ass
so how was fauci trying to cover his ass
by the
the way he talked about the game of fun
function
to try to downplay it and you know make
it look like
no not directly and it was only a little
bit of money
and it wasn't that kind of gain of
function yeah he did all that
but that doesn't mean he's guilty of a
crime
because whether you're guilty or not
guilty you're going to kind of cover
your ass
we'd expect it in both situations so
um i i think that there probably is
something
technically true about funding that
ended up in the wrong place but i don't
know that that being technically true
makes fouchy a bad person or a liar
necessarily so i'm not quite of that
opinion yet
my opinion is that he might have been
wrong a lot like everybody
you know unfortunately this was not the
kind of emergency in which
we could say well the the public is dumb
but thank goodness we have experts it
wasn't that kind of
problem it was a problem where the
experts didn't know
but they were doing the best they could
so i'm going to be consistent with what
i said at the beginning of the pandemic
which is that at the end of the pandemic
we're going to be blaming
our leaders for making bad decisions and
i think it's a little bit
harsh you sort of have to do it anyway
because people have to be accountable
but it's a little harsh because people
were guessing and it was fog of war
some were going to get it right by luck
some were going to get it wrong
by bad luck and
and criticizing the people who got it
wrong i i
just just not much to gain than that
all right
somebody say he actively suppressed the
lab leak
theory well here's what i asked about
the lab leak theory
given that we know now that there is a
place
on the genome where you look
specifically a place to look
to see if something has been engineered
all of those opinions about it not being
engineered
they had not not yet looked at the place
that you could look to find out if it
was
what how do you explain that
that we had a strong opinion about it
before looking at the one thing that
would actually tell us if it happened or
not
well that's your world you live in and
i am going to go off and enjoy the rest
of my birthday
derek my goodness you're much too nice
um
i i do work hard to try to make a
difference
that is true so it is my intention it is
always my intention to work hard
to make something better so i try and
thank
and i appreciate very much you
recognizing that
and thank you so much and i will talk to
you
tomorrow
