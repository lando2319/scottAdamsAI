and welcome to another
insanely
great experience
i don't even call this entertainment
it's not education it's not
entertainment it's an experience
you're going to feel this from the
inside out today the hair on the back of
your neck is going to be tingle tingle
tingle
and
not only that
but you're going to feel
like everything's starting to head in
the right direction
why
because perhaps it is
this might be the beginning of
something special that begins with the
simultaneous
you don't want to miss it because it
could be the key to unlocking all of the
happiness for the rest of your life i'm
just saying
you might regret it if you miss it and
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
a tankered chalice or stein a canteen
jericho flash a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite
beverage
i like coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine of the day thing makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
yes the oft-quoted verse
that's correct
oh that was so good
what is that
um
well what's happening lately
so cnm's a streaming service
called cnn plus
um
it uh it's not a plus anymore
so cnn plus uh got minus
so there are new owners of the
the company that bought cnn said let's
get rid of this lame service that only
reportedly had 10 000 subscribers
uh
which is
i i think the bad part was not
if you think about it the bad part
is not that
that they didn't get a lot of customers
what
uh okay somebody paid fifty dollars for
the most obtuse comment on youtube ever
but the problem i think
with cnn plus
is that as a subscription service
and it was subscription right that was
the whole point
uh i think this is where cnn showed the
world
how much people valued their content
because nobody would pay for a little
extra
[Laughter]
isn't that the real problem
so the real problem i don't think is
that it didn't work out as a technology
or as a business model i think what it
did is it showed that the
the flagship of the the property the
main tv show
probably isn't something that anybody
would pay for
now that kind of makes sense doesn't it
because you would think that you would
see the same news for free somewhere
else
but would you see the same news that's
on fox news
for free
somewhere else because they have a
streaming service that
is still around so must be doing better
if you think about it cnn actually
doesn't have a product
because their product can be substituted
with
how about nothing
i'll just watch msnbc
i'll read the new york times and i'll
look at a website and i'm going to see
the same news
you know because the left-leaning news
has lots of competition
so that's really the big stories that
nobody would pay for it
uh here's a
a smallish story becoming a
big story
and i wonder if the if the big
um corporate press will pick up on this
or not i think they they might have to
kill this story
but as you know michael schellenberger
is running for governor in california as
an independent
which normally would be just sort of the
graveyard
to losing a
uh
an election
but
he's the most unique candidate well that
doesn't make sense nothing is the most
unique
but he's the first candidate i know of
who's tried to run on competence
and knowledge
somebody was going to try it eventually
so all he does is he he's got you know
books
that are exactly on topic
that he's researched and so he has very
specific
solutions that are exactly tailored for
you know the
the state they have wider application
but they're perfectly suited for running
for governor
so he's demonstrated a body of knowledge
in great detail along with solutions to
the specific problems of california
and he just wanted to hear so here's the
big news
he just won
a coveted endorsement from
one of the biggest endorsing groups
taxpayer groups in california whose name
i
doubly forgot to copy and paste into my
notes
but the point is
he just got a huge endorsement as an
independent
and it's not an accident
the before of the yeah it was the jarvis
somebody will tell me it's the jarvis
tax or somebody blah blah blah
so uh it's it's a very influential group
and
the fact that they liked him um and
their orientation is taxes
that's a pretty strong endorsement given
that he's coming in with lots of
solutions for
you know social social problems the fact
that the tax people like him also
like who does that
who gets an endorsement well who comes
in
with uh specific proven solutions
for social problems like
um
homelessness
and drug addiction you know and drug
addicts on the street
and you know but also
climate change
not from a you know a panicked
perspective but from a practical
perspective of what you can and cannot
do and what works and what doesn't
so he comes in with all these things
that fix
they're really designed to fix the
problems that the people on the left
would also say are big problems
and he gets an endorsement from the
people who like low taxes
it just shows you that his solutions
don't require a lot of money
and and they work so they apparently
they read all of his books
and said okay this these are practical
solutions that don't look like they cost
a lot of money
and
boom i mean this is a really really big
deal and it's probably right it's
teetering on the edge of the the larger
corporate press
noticing that something's going on here
that's not like anything else
yeah do you know what makes a story
you've heard um it's not a story if a
dog bites a band because that happens
all the time but it's a story if a
if a man bites a dog
so the news is always looking for
somebody who's doing something not just
better
because that's not really news
and not really just more of it
because that's why you don't see a lot
of reporting
on the details of like shootings every
weekend because it's sort of the same
story there's more of it so that's not
as newsworthy as other stuff but when
somebody does something in a completely
different way
like aoc
you know aoc was
sort of a story of you know the way she
did it wouldn't you say
because she did things differently
that's what was exciting right she was
young she was you know she just had
everything going on to make it something
that was different but schellenberger is
doing the same thing in a more in a far
more directed way like directed
solutions way
and nobody's done this
and correct me if i'm wrong but nobody's
even tried this
nobody's tried to
demonstrate great mastery of content
with specific solutions and then run for
office
am i wrong i don't think it's ever been
done and it has been done i doubt it's
been done as well because such is so
directed at things that californians
care about anyway it's going to get
big um
so let's talk about uh
do you all know the background of the
story about
desantis fighting against disney and
taking away disney's
special status because disney
opposed the so-called don't say gay law
which isn't really a don't say gay law
and are you following this whole story
everybody
so i don't want to give you the whole
background
because
most of you probably are familiar with
it so you can google it if you if if you
need to
but here's my take on it
so even fox news uses the word
retaliation
as for why desantis wants to remove from
disney
some special status they had where they
could control the land and the area that
they owned
without as much government red tape and
interference now my understanding is
that when it was first granted to them
it was because it just made everything
easier
they just didn't have to go through all
through all the government red tape to
do things that
you know
probably made sense it was good for the
state and you know florida got lots of
lots of tourists and disney
got their work done cheaper and easier
and i don't know maybe some tax do they
have some tax benefits to something like
that
so i don't know the history of it but
here's the thing
i i could not argue that it should or
should not exist
because i'd have to look into it more
deeply but i don't care about that at
the moment
if you're doing something in in the
political realm that even the people who
are on your side call retaliation
i feel like you should be impeached for
that
and
otherwise i think desantis is sort of a
superstar i mean i can easily
imagine a desantis presidency that would
do a lot of good stuff that
would not be crazy and you know wouldn't
be as divisive as maybe other people
anybody you're thinking of
um
so i have a very high opinion of
desantis and now hold on hold on
have you heard my argument yet
i'm seeing the critics already descended
but i'm going to get to your point of
view
i promise you
i will i will try to characterize your
point your point of view as as
accurately as possible
if you'll allow me just just hold off
right
okay because this isn't the place you
come to for the the reflex opinions that
are going to look like everybody else's
opinions you wouldn't be here for that
right
now
so
the argument in favor of retaliation
would go like this
and see if i see if i can characterize
this for you as strongly as you'd like
the argument for desantis would be you
really have to push back
every place you can
otherwise the left if they get an inch
they'll take a mile you've seen it a
million times
nothing matters but power
it's all about power
and if you let them push you and you
don't push back
then you know the whole thing falls
apart
is that strong enough
does that does that capture your general
opinion okay
now
i'm also going to start agreeing with
you so now now i've described i've
described your opinion
now is it somebody called that a straw
man was that a straw man
i thought that was actually a steel man
but is that a straw man
i feel like that's a strong argument
so i'm going to now agree with it in my
opinion
the argument that you should push back
against anybody who's trying to
continuously push you right we're not
talking about like a one-off situation
that you might treat differently i'm
talking about like a permanent power
situation where one side is always
pushing you they're just always pushing
you
i would think that it's a perfectly
strong and valid argument based on
history and human
human psychology and motivation and
basically every observation in science
we know
that it makes sense to push back
are we all on the same page
so far
is that a straw man i'm not sure if i
can satisfy some of you people
how much more can i agree with you
all right here's the butt
do you think there could ever be an
exception
do you think there should ever be an
exception
and i would say this should be one
exception
it should be if you can't win with your
argument in the in the realm of politics
if your argument isn't strong enough
and so you resort to something that's
literally called retaliation by your own
side
for something that's a separate topic
everybody would agree it's a separate
topic
so retaliating against disney right in
front of us right in front of the public
you know there's nothing being hidden
here
a separate topic
just for the the power balance to push
back
i feel is impeachable
hold on let me make my argument you
haven't heard my argument yet
okay
how many of you liked uh ronald reagan
pretty good right if you're if you're a
republican or you lean right probably
you liked him a lot now
what what was he really good at
well one of the things he was really
good at is making his case
so
what is what is a better strategy
making the better argument
or retaliation
now if i put reagan into the example and
i'm not even talking about a specific
policy suppose you had ronald reagan and
he could just make the better argument
or he could get some retaliation in an
unrelated area which would be the better
strategy
well i would say the strategy is to win
the strategy is not to retaliate
do you know what retaliation is in this
model
because all of us are are spectators to
a spectator sport that we kind of like
don't we
admit it if you're watching this live
stream is probably for most of you is
because you sort of like the
entertainment element of politics as
much as knowing what's going on
and if you like the entertainment
element
what is that little
reward you get when you watch
entertainment
what's the reward
for any kind of entertainment it's
dopamine right
i mean i might be wrong about the the
chemical signature
but you get a little chemical hit right
it's like a reward
if your team
wins you get a little chemical boost
might be testosterone but it's like a
little high right
a little testosterone when your team
wins especially
so when you see
your team retaliate
how does that feel how does it feel
just forget about the strategy we're not
talking whether it's a good idea forget
about the policy forget about this
specific topic but how does it feel
feels pretty good doesn't it
feels pretty good
so
if you like to feel good
then desantis is uh retaliation
is exactly what you wanted
and if that's what you want
i i guess i would support you with that
if you like it because it's delicious
and you know what you like and it's an
entertainment sport and you just said
you know
it would just really feel good to see
desantis kick some ass
wouldn't it
it would feel kind of good
all right so you can get what you want
with the retaliation
now personally i just have a different
preference
because i i don't get the i didn't get
the dopamine hit
i don't know why
don't know why but i'm watching the same
story you are but i didn't get a
dopamine hit
like when i heard when i heard that he
was using it uh retaliation that word
just triggered the out of me
like i don't know just something in my
brain just went what
what
i'm paying somebody meaning not me i'm
not paying desantis but
but taxpayers
taxpayers hired a guy
a person
and that person is telling us right in
front of us
that on our dime
he's getting retaliation
fired
you're fired
[Laughter]
you know i'm sorry i didn't i didn't
hire you to give me a dopamine yet
you're not my drug dealer
i want you to win
how about winning i hired you to
win
all right if i care about this issue the
law and the school let's win the
thing let's do it right let's do it like
reagan would do it let's do it like
clinton would do it let's do it like
 obama would do it do you know
how obama would do it he'd argue it
better
he'd do a better job do you know how
reagan would do it he'd argue better
he'd do a better job do you know how
trump would do it he'd argue better he'd
do a better job desantis just
apparently whiffed on this or something
because he was didn't feel like he was
winning and so he's going to retaliation
that's weak
that's weak
he can't win his own argument that's
weak
so to me it looks weak
and i don't i don't i wouldn't hire a
guy to retaliate
if he were your employee
let's say he was your uh let's say you
were a owner of a plumbing contract
company
and one of your employees
uh was re told you told you straight out
i decided to retaliate against one of my
customers because then word will get
around and maybe the next customer won't
won't treat me the same way
would you say well good job
you really have to retaliate against
customers
because if you don't retaliate against
customer the next one's not going to
respect you
no
you would fire him
on the spot
because you don't hire people to
retaliate it's not a good strategy it's
not a winning strategy it's a dopamine
drug strategy you don't hire him to be
your drug dealer
desantis is your governor he's not your
drug dealer
he's not there to make you feel good
he's there to win now winning should
feel good but win the right battle like
don't win don't win the
all right so
let me say again
if you like it because it feels good and
but you're also aware that that's that's
what you're on about
that's okay
i mean that's okay if you know exactly
what you're in
you're in it for
then that's that's cool and let me say
again that i think that desantis is a
superstar
i could easily i could easily support
him for president
yeah
because i think he's just he's more
common sensical than anybody else i feel
like he got bad advice on this one
thing
unless
it's purely political and
and
i i'd hate to see him
you know of course he's a political
animal and you know there's no there's
no denying that but i feel like this is
just
putting dopamine over winning
and i just never want to do that
so
let me ask you this
if we all accept the idea that you
should push back on people who are
pushing you
would you accept that there could ever
be a
an exception where the strategy is more
important
than than the dopamine hit
do you do you buy that frame
and if not
uh well what would be uh
uh
no don't just don't just say something
bad about me or that desantis is good
these are just generic things give me
no to stop saying generic things
be specific
well what would be wrong with that frame
all right i get
way too many comments to
uh
scott is triggered by a word meant to
trigger well
remember
the word came from
the entity that likes desantis the most
it was a fox news word if cnn had said
that desantis
uh
had been retaliating i'm not sure i
would have taken it seriously
because i would just say oh that's just
how they're framing it
but if his own side is framing it that
way it's probably a little closer to the
truth
i can laugh at your opinion all i want i
show you again so if you get a dopamine
hit by feeling that you're smarter than
me on this topic or that your
your strategy would be
more effective
then
i'm in favor of that
if you could get a dopamine hit anyway
at all
just go ahead and go ahead and do it
anyway
i'd rather win than get a dopamine hit
but that's just me yeah elon musk wants
to start a city
that i think would be called starbase
and it would of course it would have to
get the approval of the people who
already live
there but the idea would be to
have some kind of i don't know local
control and design and
engineer a
yeah an awesome place to live so that
the
he can attract uh i guess high quality
workers for his own companies
and
have i ever told you that that had
always been my dream to design a city
because our cities are all wrong that
you know i keep hearing um who's got a
good idea for
fixing crime in our cities and
everything and i keep saying why would
you fix cities
you can't really fix the cities
you know you can barely put a tourniquet
on them i think cities are just gonna
die
because
unless you you
start over
there there's nothing about a city that
works there's just too much population
uh to transportation to everything's in
the wrong place and
i don't think you could fix the city but
i've long said that the next phase of
you know human let's say civilization
will be to start from scratch and design
towns and cities
and even blocks and even the house
itself
in in a very a b tested
human-centric way until you can build an
insanely good place to live that
doesn't cost much
now that might be the thing that elon
musk could bring to a city design
imagine any other way to build a city
what happens
you bring in private companies
whose job it is to build let's say homes
you say give us give us the best bid
to build the cheapest home well even the
best bid is going to try to make the
most profit they possibly can
so they're going to build the house
that specifically they know how to build
and they can already do it and
and they can just outbuild the outbid
the other people they're not going to
build they're not going to build you the
city of tomorrow
you're basically going to get the same
houses
but somebody's going to give you the
cheap one
if money is what matters
but elon musk
and maybe he alone you know again we
keep running into situations that uh
only a few people could handle
you know but
you know maybe jeff bezos could do it or
something but
um but musket it
and imagine starting from scratch and
saying okay what must what must the city
have
like what are the specifications
starting with a human being
and even starting with you know which
human beings
are you going to favor you know
children or single people or
all equal do you make different models
for each one so you start with the very
specifics of what a person needs then
you design their house or at least their
living structure or whatever it looks
like
and then from the house
you figure out what type and kinds of
houses should be like right next to it
and should they be
up in a building where you never see
anybody except in an elevator
or should it be arranged in a way that
you have some forced but optional
i guess that's you know let's say
frequent but optional
interaction with your neighbors
in some way that is good and and maybe
you design what types of houses for
types of families so let's say a blue
house
is only for someone who has kids
because then you want to put the blue
houses together because then the kids
can beat each other and everybody's
happy
and
uh
there's always somebody who says i hate
this
you don't have to live there
i didn't i didn't say it's the one place
to live
you know everybody if you describe a
product they just say well
i'm not going to use it so screw that
product
it might be good for other people
anyway i think you could take the price
of living down by 90 percent
and i think you could take the quality
of life
up to the point where both drug
addiction
and loneliness and mental health would
be cut in half
i think you could do that with physical
design
i'll say it again i think the phys a
physically
engineered city
engineered
in a way that and elon musk would do it
i would imagine you start with the
specifications of the human and then
work out what the city looks like to
support it nobody's ever done that
nobody's ever even come close to doing
that
and i can't even imagine anybody else
who could do it
but he could sort of do it
easily
[Laughter]
i don't even think it would be hard he
just
you know pull together the people who
know how to do that stuff
throw a few billion at him that he has
you know laying around
do a little uh
no nothing like levittown
okay
let me say if if what you thought of was
levittown
you're really really far from what i'm
talking about i mean that's that's like
levittown was like a two
you know elon musk could design a nine
or a ten that they wouldn't be
comparable in any way
so
um
that's coming could be interesting
you at the beginning of the
ukraine conflict
i said that uh ukraine might be uh
better off than people thought because
they would have new tech military
equipment that
nato and the united states would make
available to them i speculated
and that it could make a big difference
now i'm not so sure that the like new
like you know um
what would you call it uh
uh
sort of secret
stuff
what's the word for secret technology
there's some other word for it that they
use
anyway
um but there are two things that we
don't know too much about that are being
shipped to ukraine one is called a ghost
drone
or phoenix phoenix ghost drone
now
classified right it's classified
i think that's a word so i think it's
classified meaning that we don't know
what capabilities it has
also there's a an unmanned boat
i guess you'd call that a drone boat
wouldn't you an unmanned boat would be a
drone boat wouldn't it
so
so both of these things were apparently
being
delivered
and i think the the ghost drones were
supposedly
designed especially for ukraine
and then maybe they're anti-tank and
anti-personnel but i think people are
guessing
yeah are the drones of submersibles
that's a really good question
really good question
i don't know
so
so here is what i had speculated ukraine
would have access to although maybe it's
taken longer than i would have imagined
but they may have now the good stuff
the the phrase i used at the beginning
that tech wise they might have access to
the good stuff in a way that no other
uh military has ever had
like actually weapons that no one's ever
used
ukrainians could have access to them
because part of my speculation was that
the weapons manufacturers
would rush the good stuff into the fight
to see how it works
because that would just be great for
them if it did work and if it didn't
work maybe nobody would notice
better than nothing right they'd be
happier that you tried than if you
didn't
so yeah it could be just a whole
gigantic weapons testing ground and
that's that's the real reason for the
war
i wouldn't
i wouldn't rule it out
that the defense contractors have
created a war just to test stuff
like as crazy as that sounds
like you you would love to say well that
that's not going to happen
like that's that's way over the line
that could never happen
but i think it could
i'm not saying it did
but i think it could
um
so here's my question about these uh
classified drones let's take the one
that's in the air
it seems the more important one
is the one that's in the air
let's say you had a drone that could
just
fly longer and was stealthier
and could hit whatever it wanted would
return to base and just turn around and
do it again
something that could just like do
mission after mission and every time it
would get away with it every time they
would hit something
what if they have something like that
and
and how many of those would you need
because if you got little switchblades
like they're all suicide things but what
if these are not suicide things and they
have enough munitions
and
and it just never gets hit
and it can just go out and hit anything
it wants well wouldn't it start with
whatever is the
the most important assets that the
russian army has
and just take them out
seems like it seems like it would just
take out the most important stuff so it
would take out then the anti-drone stuff
and then the regular drones
could get in there
sucking more dopamine fantasizing about
a longer war
you know
there's no doubt about the fact that
that we are uh sick people who are
looking at the war as an entertainment
property if you're far enough away
it's actually interesting
in a way that makes you feel icky
but it's interesting
and
i don't know how to change that right
so there probably is a dopamine
talking about a war i wouldn't doubt
that at all
but
but that doesn't mean that i should
enlist just to
address your uh adjust your comment
there
all right um
so that's happened
so jonathan turley had a uh interesting
uh article
in which he thinks that uh elon musk's
bid for twitter
is going to put the board in a in a
tough place because his his offer is so
good especially if he if if he were to
increase it which is the rumor
it's going to be hard for the board to
justify that they're actually working on
behalf of the stockholders
so this is going to get really
interesting
um
rasmussen had a poll
about masks
and
and the airline decisions to drop mass
mask requirements
and 51 said it was a good idea to drop
the masks on planes
to which i said
what
wha what kind of bubble have i been in
that only 51 were happy that masks are
dropped on flights
are you surprised
uh 34 said it's a bad decision and they
would prefer the masks were required on
flights
34
34 is exactly the amount of of americans
who don't fly
i don't know if that's true but i'll bet
it's i'll bet it's close all right
somebody's who can google really fast
find out what percentage of the
population actually flies who would be
adults who would answer a poll
so percentage of adults who fly i i have
to think
that at least 34 don't ever fly
right
so isn't it the people who don't ever
fly who you who just say ah screw them
make them wear masks
i with these poles i never know exactly
what's being measured it could be
jealousy
yeah we might be seeing a bunch of
jealousy where the people who never are
going to be on the flight and they know
they're never going to fly because it's
just too expensive or for whatever
reason they're never going to fly
they're just like yeah yeah they should
wear masks on those flights
totally they should totally wear a mess
on those flights
all right
this johnny depp
story
is just
so horrible i can't look away so
johnny depp and this he i guess he's
suing amber heard for because she wrote
a story
uh that seemed to suggest that he was
physically abusive
and so he's suing her for saying that
and so in order for her to win i guess
she would have to show that he was he
was physically abusive
in order for him to win i guess he has
to show that he wasn't and maybe that
she was
so he has shown that she has she was
physically abusive
so apparently his audios
do make that case
but there's one audio in which he or
was it no i guess an uh email message or
something in which he did say something
about
you know fantasizing about her
her burnt body and being dead
and so his fantasizing about her being
dead
is being used as you know an indication
that maybe he's he's an abuser too
but having heard what
amber heard did this seems well
confirmed because she's admitting it on
audio
don't you think it would be not entirely
out of reason
to at least have the
the fantasy
of some bad thing happening to her in
return
but there's no indication that he acted
on it or planned to act on it
so the best defense
the best defense the emperor heard could
come up with
is that amber heard was such a monster
that in his private thoughts he wished
that she would just burn to death
and i'm thinking
i don't know that that's an indictment
of johnny depp
that sounds like
even though johnny depp had uh imbibed a
lot of alcohol he still knew
what he was dealing with
and maybe his private thoughts as
opposed to his actions
which apparently there's no indication
that he did anything abusive that i've
seen
i feel as if that wasn't an entirely
uncalled for opinion of his
so i'm not sure it worked exactly the
way
the herd defense hoped it would
because i think a lot of people heard
what heard the things that she did and
said and how she treated him
and when he said something like
he would f her burnt corpse just to make
sure she was dead
i think a lot of people thought to
themselves well you got to do that just
to make sure she's dead
so
but
not in real life we're not talking about
real actions we do not approve
of violence
ever
all right
um
she put down a cigarette on his face
is that has that been
proven
yowzer
i don't know if that's been proven
um
all right
so what uh what else is going on
have i uh
have i completed my mission of
the most important
live stream in the world it made some of
you mad
but that's why you come back
i had a philosophy teacher
who used to talk about
when you have a loose tooth
have you ever had the this thing went
back when you were a kid and you would
be losing a tooth and so you start
playing with it with your tongue
and it would hurt
like you'd push it and it hurt
and you just keep pushing it just keep
hurting
you just keep hurting yourself
until it came out
and you talk about that being you know
like an analogy for life
yeah
we're always hurting ourselves but we're
pushing through
oh the mike tyson how many of you saw
the video of the drunk guy
mocking mike tyson just mercilessly on a
flight
until apparently mike tyson turned
around and punched him in the head
several times
now unfortunately
the video only shows the mocking part
but i only saw a still picture of
mike tyson leaning over the uh it looks
like he's leaning over his uh his seat
to punch the other guy
how much i wish i'd seen the video of
that not the still picture
because
oh my god did that
did that guy have it coming
there is video
oh there is video okay well i've i've
only seen the still picture maybe maybe
they didn't want to show the video
because it was too
so which reminds me of uh
i just watched a clip
of joe rogan i guess he was recently
interviewing uh
mma fighter jake shields
and jake shields was at some uh event
where there was antifa
and apparently uh as he tells the story
he was pulling some people off he was
pulling some antifa people off of
somebody so antifa was attacking
somebody he was he was pulling them off
which caused antifa to turn on him
and call him a nazi
so they'd like you know get the nazi so
they attacked they attacked him but
unfortunately he's a
professional
mma fighter
so
as he subtly put it he dropped two of
them
i would love to know what that meant i i
think that was the word he used i think
he said he dropped two of them or
something like that whatever the exact
word was he was very unspecific
but i always thought to myself
how much fun would it be to be a
professional fighter
and to find yourself in a fight
that's like a legitimate fight
just an actual okay this is actually a
street fight and i have a complete right
to fight back
you know and i suppose you've got the
the legal problem that if you hurt
somebody you you're a you're a lethal
weapon and they're not or something so
that yeah it has to be some limits there
but
it had to be fun
well it had to be like a good day for
him it's like oh my god i got that i get
got to knock out two antifa guys and i'm
thinking if you knock down people like
for a living that's your sport
that must have been just such a fun day
talk about dope i mean
uh yeah just don't kill him you don't
you don't want to hurt him too badly and
i feel like my
mike tyson knew just how hard enough to
punch
like he's an expert puncher
maybe not
maybe he just punched him and
because he was mad who knows
tyson retaliated
yeah now just to be clear
i'm not opposed to retaliation
you just have to do it when it's your
best strategy
if it's not your best strategy well
then i'm not going to pay somebody to do
it
why would i pay somebody to do a
sub-optimal strategy but no retaliation
has as its
places in the right place
uh yeah he's been in trouble for uh
assault before or so
but i don't think any uh
can you imagine a jury
seeing that video
if you were on the jury would you
would you convict mike tyson let's say
the guy recovered he just had some
bad bruising but he wasn't badly injured
can you imagine i can't imagine
convicting mike tyson for that i would i
would laugh that off
i was saying nope nope i saw the video
nope
but he technically broke the law yeah i
know it's your job as a sworn juror to
follow the law
not how you feel about the case i know i
know so what do you vote not guilty
i don't know i don't think you could
slip that one past it past the keeper
that guy will sue i don't know maybe
all right that's all i got for now i'll
let you go early get some work done
and thank you for joining
the most provocative live stream of all
time
bye for now
