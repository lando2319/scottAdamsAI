and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
you know it doesn't get any better than
this
and for some of you i'm going to kick
off your your day just right
yeah
i'm going to tell you a meme joke that i
just saw on the locals platform
in the comments section on locals they
can post uh memes
unlike on youtube
and uh when as soon as i signed out one
of the memes went by
and the the meme was
that the best thing about conservative
women
no penis
i i just lost i've been laughing for ten
minutes
yep
so that's a that's a good dating tip for
conservative men
conservative men if you're heterosexual
and you'd like a good
dating
outcome
stick to a conservative woman because at
least you'll get one thing
totally right
no penis
and that's a good start i mean lots of
other things you have to get right
you know you want to have the same goals
in life and
like the same things but if you can
start off
in your base for your dating success is
uh dating a woman who doesn't have a
penis you are going to be way ahead
as a conservative heterosexual so that's
my
tip for you
um if you'd like to take today's
uh
live stream upper level all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker
chelsea stein a canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day i think it makes everything
better go
oh
that's so good
so you know how i like to pick apart
the liberal thinking
i do that a lot
specifically i usually rail against the
fact that
lefties
people on the left
like to build systems that couldn't
possibly work
because they don't take into account
human motivation
you've heard me say that too many times
right
consistently people on the left they
always leave out that human motivation
variable the biggest one it's the
biggest variable they leave that one out
but today i'm going to be doing
something similar
with that
conservative thinking
there is a conservative blind spot that
is destroying the country
destroying the country
and
um i don't think you see it
and i think it takes somebody who's you
know doesn't live in that space full
time
to just step outside and say you can't
see what i'm saying well let me let me
tell you what i'm saying
all right
some of you are going to have a tough
time with this live stream we're going
to start out with some easy topics first
but when i get to that
it's gonna be a little painful for some
of you because you're gonna see your
entire life philosophy just destroyed
right in front of you
now it's not about god don't worry i'm
not gonna i'm not gonna mess with your
religion
that stays intact and i'm not going to
mess with any of your ethical moral
stands
your moral ethical stance will all be
intact as well as your religious beliefs
but there's a gigantic logic
blind spot a logic blind spot and you've
been duped by some persuasion that you
don't see
and i'm going to fix that later and you
and some of you are going to have a
tough time with this
you're going to have a mental situation
that's just not comfortable for you
but others are going to have a feeling
that you're seeing things clearly for
the first time
it's going to be weird yeah we'll get to
it but first we're going to wait for
some people to come in talk about some
other things
so this is anecdotal but
i feel like
if you collect enough of these
anecdotals they might add up to
something
so as you know i had covid about over a
month ago and then i got to experience
some version of long covet
i thought
i had been over it like a week ago
because my mental state was back to
ideal
so i had brain fog for a long time but
then when it went back it was perfectly
good it feels like it's you know same as
always
however
i also thought that maybe i didn't
exercise enough during that time or
maybe maybe
i'd gotten old kind of quickly
because i was having real trouble just
walking upstairs
just walking upstairs
and it lasted for weeks
and i was mistakenly under the
impression that maybe just my fitness
had taken a hit
you know maybe age had caught up with me
i feel like i had you know pushed it off
too long and like ah finally
but what it was was my entire body hurt
and ached so much and i was also twisted
up that just walking upstairs was
actually in one case i actually bailed i
actually couldn't do it it was actually
a time in the last two weeks
where i didn't use the stairs because i
couldn't
true story
today i can run up and down the stairs
just like it's flat ground
like there's no difference between the
stairs and flat space right now
now i didn't realize that that probably
was the long covered
i mean i'm not a doctor it's just an
anecdote doesn't mean it'll apply to you
but it kicked my ass
for a month
and now we hear that having a prior
infection
no matter how recently
does not protect you from the next one
how many months in the next year am i
going to lose complete months
of quality of life
apparently i could lose two or three
more months in the coming year
because i can get
omicron two or three more times
according to the science
and each of those times i would lose a
 month
that's a lot of time to lose i don't
want that last month back believe me
that sucked
so just just be aware that if you have a
way to avoid it go ahead and avoid it
michael shellenberger has a long tweet
thread that's just like shocking
it's just shocking i don't know what to
make of it but you know biden released a
bunch of our strategic petroleum
reserves so i guess the united states
has some big place they store a bunch of
oil in case there's an emergency and
this was enough of an emergency that
they release some to lower gas prices
but it turns out as michael
schellenberger reports here and i think
reuters reported it and michael's
wrapping it up in a nice thread
that
over 5 million barrels of that oil went
to china
and other nations
wait what
that's right we released oil from the
national
the strategic petroleum reserves and the
five million barrels went to other
countries
that feels like including china and that
feels like not what that was intended to
do
and then of course there's you know
reports that it didn't work and some
people say it worked a little bit but it
didn't work enough to make much
difference
i think the level of incompetence here
is insane but here's the thing you
shouldn't be surprised
if oil goes on the market
and goes anywhere
because if you've never heard this word
before
let me make you smarter
fungible
how many people know what that word
means
you hear it sometimes but it's one of
those things you hear and you go i don't
know what that meant
you had to look it up
fungible
oil is considered fungible as are other
things because oil looks the same
and if i release some oil on the market
it doesn't matter if you buy it or
you buy it it's just oil
and i don't know where it came from and
who's selling it it's just oil so it
starts out as somebody's oil
but the moment it goes in the free
market it's just oil
and it turns out that if you
release a bunch of
oil
in a in a short period of time
the only thing that can happen
is that people buying oil bid for it and
then buy it
that's the only thing that can happen
people who want oil say hey there's some
more oil what's the price here's how
much i'd pay oh somebody paid more i
guess somebody else got that oil that's
it
so there wasn't really any any chance
that releasing oil wouldn't make some of
it go to china right it's just fungible
it's just going somewhere and you can't
really track oil
at least you can't you know track it in
the way that you could control it in
that sense and you wouldn't if you
wanted to
i guess the united states and china are
both working on these high-powered
microwave cruise missiles
does anything sound
scarier than a microwave cruise missile
apparently these will be fired into the
enemy's territory
and then the microwave will knock out
all their electronics
i guess not killing the people so it
kills the electronics so be like a
you know low version of an em emt or
something
now
i love emp not en emt
yeah it's like a like a poor man's emp i
guess although it's pretty expensive
and it's a long-range standoff weapon so
we could basically lob one of these into
the
into some high-tech
military
unit and it would just shut down all
their electronics
and i think this is one of the things
that will be knocking down drones
you know
something like this
but i don't really have a take on this
other than
could we have any more evidence that war
doesn't work
i don't think we could have any more
evidence than we already have that the
war just doesn't work
like who doesn't
at what point do we realize it just
doesn't work
if you if you start a war
you're going to get annihilated as well
as whoever you're attacking probably
it's like everybody loses now that's
different than how it used to be
um
rasmussen has a new poll shocking of
course
and that
half about half of the people in the
country believe their
the elections are not credible
or at least not guaranteed to be fair
all right so here's what uh rasmussen
says about it
about election integrity 50 of the
people they polled think cheating is
likely in the midterms
likely
fifty percent
likely
what
fifty percent say it's likely
now i feel like uh people probably
interpret the question differently so
that's part of it
certainly everybody should have said
there might be some
it's a big country 50 states there's
going to be some cheating right i don't
think there's even the people who think
that the elections are good enough and
that's plenty of people even they would
say well you know here and there there
might be a smattering of cheating but
it's not going to make any difference
so
it's not clear how people thought they
were answering the question were they
saying yes there will be a smattering of
it or yes it will change the outcome of
the election we don't know what they
were thinking when they answered it so
be aware of that
and the majority fear of the upcoming
midterm elections could be tainted right
of course
fear is always appropriate in that case
um
and uh 52 percent of likely u.s voters
believe it is at least somewhat likely
that cheating affected the outcome of
the 2020 election
now isn't it interesting that you could
get banned from twitter
for saying something that a majority of
americans believe is true
or are leading toward
interesting you could get banned from
social media
for the majority opinion in this country
the majority of it
you know everybody understands that you
could get banned for a minority opinion
you know you've said something
so awful that the majority of people
wouldn't have anything to do with it
but now you can get banned for the
majority opinion the common
what the hell is social media for if you
get banned for the most common opinion
that the people have
all right
uh yes and i saw in the comments uh you
reminded me to say
so
alex berenson is back on twitter
so we don't know the facts of it because
i guess
twitter and berenson's legal people
signed some kind of a non-disclosure
agreement to not say what the deal was
but apparently he was successful in in
making his case that he should not have
been banned and he's
back on twitter
somebody says sorry scott you wanted him
banned forever
no you mind reader
i never said that
that's not even close to my opinion
you know did have i ever said that
somebody should be banned for their
opinions on social media
that could not be closer to the opposite
of my opinion
now
i've been telling you lately that
there's something that's happened in
society that's really different do you
remember when we would just disagree on
stuff and we would see different movies
you know for several years i would say
hey we're looking at the same stuff but
it seems like we're seeing different
movies
we're in a new phase
beyond that
we've gone beyond seeing different
movies
people see the thing as the opposite of
the thing
here is an example
i'm probably one of the most outspoken
free speech people in the public domain
not once have i ever said somebody's
opinion should be squelched i've always
said the opposite
and here there was a comment even on the
subscription service
a service that somebody's paying
actually to see my opinion extra opinion
and somebody was paying and really
paying attention
thinks that my opinion is the exact
opposite
of my actual opinion
we can't tell the difference between a
thing and the opposite of the thing and
that's going to be a theme that you'll
see for the rest of this live stream
there are people who are absolutely sure
they're looking at a thing and seeing
the opposite thing that's different than
seeing a different movie a different
movie isn't necessarily the opposite
it's not yes is no
the different movie is just a different
narrative
you know two narratives can fit one set
of facts one might be right one might be
wrong but it's a narrative fitting facts
that's where we were
we actually have gone beyond that
we're all the way to we can't tell the
difference between a thing
and the opposite of that thing of that
very thing
also you'll get more examples and it'll
blow you away
all right
so a lot of people don't trust the vote
but here's my main point
in what do we have any other situation
in which the majority of the country
thinks a system is broken
and it couldn't be that hard to fix it
and yet there's no effort whatsoever by
any politician to fix it
now by fix it i don't mean to make it
accurate because i don't have any inside
information about how accurate it is how
would i know
what i mean is fix it so that half of
the country doesn't think it's broken
it might be just information could be
maybe we just need to be better informed
and then we would trust it maybe
but probably it has something to do with
the fact it was designed so you can't
audit it
let me say it again
since might be the last moment i'm ever
on social media
if a system is designed so you can't
check the result
and the and the outcome of the result is
really valuable to some people it really
really matters what the outcome is and
you can't check after the fact to see if
it was done right what's going to happen
in that case
every time
every time
there's going to be cheating
you don't know when might not be on day
one maybe it didn't happen in 2020 how
would i know
but you can guarantee it will happen
the system is designed to make it happen
let me say that in the strongest
possible way
our systems are designed to make
cheating happen
why
because that's what human motivation
would get you with the system as
designed
human motivation says that when people
can cheat and there's a big payoff and
they're not going to get caught or they
think there's a good chance they won't
get caught
there's bad behavior every time there's
no exception to that sometimes you have
to wait a few days
it doesn't happen on day one every time
but you guarantee it happens we actually
have an election system which bias
design and what i mean is since you
can't audit the electronic parts you can
only audit the counting the ballot parts
and you know some of the local stuff but
once it gets into the digital
pathway
you're done you can't see that that's
all invisible
you can't follow your vote all the way
to the final database now under that
situation
is that a system that is designed to
give us accurate outcomes
or is that a system designed
by intention
to guarantee cheating
which is it
engineers do i have any engineers who
are watching of course i do
just the engineers please all right if
you're not an engineer i'm going to ask
you to stand down for a minute
just the engineers is the election
system designed to guarantee cheating or
to prevent it
which is a design to do
engineers only
guarantee
right
all right i believe that if i were to
present what i just did to a room full
of engineers
how many people in the room full of
engineers would say that this is a
system designed to guarantee cheating
what percentage of engineers would agree
with that statement
a hundred percent
a hundred percent
right
now if you're not an engineer
and you've got opinion and opinion about
the integrity of the election system
well then you're a idiot
unless you're agreeing with the
engineers right
trust the engineers
this one's a no-brainer
yeah this would be like asking a doctor
the following question all right i'm no
doctor so i have to ask you this
question
if you took a gigantic railroad spike
and you drove it through the head of a
living person until it came out the
other end
would that cause any damage to the
person possibly death and the doctor
would say you know that's actually the
easy one
i'm pretty sure if you asked any doctor
that question we'd give you the same
answer that would be very painful
probably lead to death
would any doctor ever get that question
wrong
if you drove a spike through somebody's
head would it hurt them no they would
get that right every time do you think
any engineer is going to get this
question wrong if you design a system
that can't be audited and the people
involved really really have a good
reason to cheat and they have access to
it
is cheating going to happen
and is it designed to guarantee it
no engineer gets that question wrong
you might
you might if you're not an engineer you
might get that wrong and by the way
that's that wouldn't even be on you
because you're not trained to be an
engineer right
right
it makes a difference
it makes a difference the people trained
to design the system are the ones you
want to talk to
how do we do
you're trained to design a system here's
a system how does it look
don't ask yourself
you know if you're an english major
you know don't ask your your partner
who's the history major they're not
going to help you
ask an engineer
right and we we act like engineers don't
exist or something like i think
engineers are the most
ignored group of people in in society
because they have the most value to add
because of the thinking part
they can think
they're really clear thinkers
and we ignore them like they don't count
when we talk about political stuff you
should pay attention to the engineers
all right
well apparently i was trending on
twitter twice yesterday for two
different but related thoughts
uh here's the part where things are
going to get uncomfortable for some of
you
anybody want to stick around for that
it's going to get uncomfortable i mean
that like that's not just a weird teaser
it's going to get uncomfortable
here it comes
now the people on locals i trust you the
reason you subscribed is that you like a
little edgier uncomfortable stuff on
youtube it's going to be a different
experience if you just wandered in here
you're not going to like it
so that's your warning go away now
all right
i'm going to explain to you the problem
with conservative thought
about parenting
it goes like this
now uh if anybody's new to me or my live
stream let me give you some background
i always i often refer to myself as left
of bernie partly because that's not real
there's nothing left to bernie you know
in a few cases i actually literally am
left to bernie but those are just
exceptions
so
i identify most with conservatives
because they're better at designing
systems
that understand human motivation and the
economics and the business major in me
says well you have to include those in
your plan
because they're so important
so a very compatible with conservative
thought on most things
there is one thing that conservatives
get completely wrong and it's a logic
problem
you think it's not a logic problem and
that's the that's the illusion
so so let me set it up for you
we will not be talking about your moral
ethical or religious
standing
i have no complaints with any of that
that's all good keep that exactly the
way it is so keep your moral ethical
religious beliefs they will not be
assaulted in any way
okay
i'm only going after the logic
because can i ask you is there any
conservative here
who is opposed to thinking better about
a topic nobody right you would only be
opposed i think
i think you would only be opposed to
something that
went against your most important ethical
moral
standings and we won't be doing any of
that
none of that because that i respect
okay
so here's what i view as the
conservative worldview
and this is relevant to
teen addiction
and the younger male teen shooters so
that's the context okay
we're going to limit it to that context
for now
and i would say the conservative says if
if this is you and you is just any
person who might be a parent someday
you're just a you're an adult in the
world this is you
and the conservative thought is that
there are many books and organizations
and maybe you can listen to christ and
you can get advice and if you look for
these sources
you could be part of a great two-parent
situation
and that the statistics and all common
sense and all experience are all
compatible with the fact that that gets
you good outcomes
now i quickly quickly want to add a
caveat because this is the part to be
that's left of bernie
this is my opinion
this is only one way to do it
probably the best way
probably the best way
so will you agree with me if i say it's
the best way
i don't lose you if i say that right
if you're conservative
and i agree with you on the biggest
point this is the best way
statistically
but i would like you to agree with the
following point if you will like we'll
we'll we'll negotiate a little bit here
all right so i'm going to agree with you
on this absolutely
statistically the best way to go
i need you to agree on this
plenty of exceptions
right can can i get you to say that
plenty of exceptions
here would be an exception
and not so much to the great parent role
that you can't really beat
two great parents
that's unbeatable
but
it's hard to get
so i suppose you had one good parent and
one bad parent would that always be
better
than one single parent who's a superstar
and maybe with help
not always right and i'm not doing
anything about gender you know that's a
situation i think we could just leave
out of it
frankly i don't even think gender has
anything to do with us
now i know maybe you do but i'm saying
two strong role models probably get you
a good outcome as well so if you'll if
you'll let me agree with you
that this would be the optimal situation
can you agree with me that there would
be exceptions
there would be somebody who could make
it work with a different model may not
be preferred
might not be your first choice but they
could make it work
right
all right
do you see you see the logic problem i'm
going to ask you first to see if you see
it do you see the logic problem not
not the philosophical problem the logic
problem does anybody see it
um it assumes two parents no that that's
just an a goal
so a goal doesn't assume anything it
just says we'd like to get there right
what what is the problem with the logic
not i'm not talking about your
motivation
your religious belief nothing about that
just the logic
all right here's the problem
there's no way to get from here to there
you you you're making me think past the
sale
the sale is that you can get from here
to there
but here's the problem
all of this stuff
it already exists
and we're not there
if you could get people from here to
there
and all it would take is the things that
already exist
the problem's already solved do you see
the problem
so conservative thought is thinking past
the sale
literally a persuasion
slash logic problem
if you can't solve this problem of how
do you get somebody
to buy into this
then you have nothing
so what this is is literally nothing
but conservatives say i think we're done
here because we have a workable plan
the workable plan is to promote
two-parent households
there are resources to help you do it
there's nothing else that needs to be
done there must be something wrong with
your character or your motivation
if you're not doing it
now here's what's wrong with that
the myth
first of all
how do you get these two good parents
let me give you uh the best way i can
explain this is with an analogy
now i want you to disagree with the
analogy because that's what we do
but it's the only way to make the point
right
so analogies are good for making a novel
point but they're not good for you know
telling you what's going on with your
stupid situation
all right so here's the analogy
in order to save gas
you should flap your arms really hard
and fly instead
so you would save a lot of gas prices by
just flapping your arms and flying what
is what is wrong with that prescription
do you see any logical problem with it
it's making you think past the sale
you can't flap your arms and fly
but conservative thought takes you past
the sale and says
why are you paying for gases guess
whether you could flap your arms and fly
and then i say but you can't flap your
arms and fly and then the conservatives
say
dude
all you have to do is take advantage of
the many resources that teach you how to
flap your arms and fly
and then i say
if any of those resources worked
wouldn't everybody be flapping their
arms and flying
because that seems like that would be
like something everybody would want to
do
now you're saying that the analogy
doesn't work because the analogy doesn't
fit right well then you're on the wrong
page
here's what you're supposed to take from
the analogy
if it's not possible to do it
it's not really a path to a solution
you it's wishful thinking
it's literally imaginary
all right let me give you uh another
another entry into i'm gonna take
several
attack points okay until one of them
gets through
here's the first attack point
you imagine there's a single woman
she has unprotected sex with a man she
barely knows because they were both
drunk
the woman decides to keep the baby
now
so what's her path
does she say to the man who slept with
her once and doesn't even like her and
barely knows her name does she say hold
on
we've created a problem here where if we
keep going we're going to have a
one-parent situation and we know that's
not optimal so can i fix that
by suggesting
a single person who had sex with me once
that maybe you should read some books on
fatherhood
uh
go seek some help from some
organizations possibly seek help from
christ and get some good advice
and then you can solve this societal
problem
by finding out a way to be a good
husband and staying with me and will
live forever and happiness
what
how is that ever going to work
the the the conservative view is built
totally on an illusion
the illusion that you can take any two
people and if you train them upright
they'll have a happy marriage and the
kid will be good
no it's the people
the problem with
marriage is the people
and you can't fix that
you can't
how about murder
you know can we get rid of murder by
writing books about how you shouldn't
murder anybody
how about how about other problems how
about drug addiction
can we get rid of drug addiction by
writing a book that says if you get drug
addicted it'll be bad for you
how is that working
no you can't educate people to become
different people
and you can't make people who shouldn't
be married
be happily married
the people who decide not to stay
together don't they have reasons
you act like there's no reasons
when somebody doesn't stay with a spouse
it's because the spouse is beating them
one is an alcoholic
doesn't have a job is a bad role model
you can't fix that
you can't fix that by telling them to
read a book
do you know anybody who ever took an
unhappy marriage and turned it into a
good one by reading a book
or maybe you think you know one
all right let me tell you the most
absolutely maddening
illusion that conservatives have
maddening it goes like this
i showed tough love to my children
and they turned out great
therefore the method i used to parent is
one that can be generalized to other
kids in other situations because my
method clearly worked
how many of you believe that
how many of you believe
that
there are plenty of examples of people
who did good parenting they did the
right things and they got a good outcome
with their kid therefore good parenting
can fix your kid as well how many
yeah do you know how many people told me
today on twitter that all you needed to
do for uh helping your drug addicted kid
is to seek help
seek help
that's the conservative depth of
thinking on addiction
if you had maybe loved your child better
and sought help
well you'd be okay now
there is no help
that was the point of my tweet thread
that got a lot of attention there is no
help if your teen is troubled and male
there's no services
there's no therapist
who can make a difference
there's no anything
there's nothing and
and somebody said to me well therefore
are you recommending that we
give up
did you hear that
or lose hope and i say no
because you know why
any individual kid can still break
through
any individual kid can still break
through so you always have hope because
you don't know if your kid is one of
those kids
so you always have hope
and you should always do whatever you
can
but
imagine that the main thing that's going
on is how you manage the kid
having an illusion and you are
the whole world
let me say it again it's not just a
harmless little illusion it's not a
difference of agreement the conservative
view
that good parenting fixes things like
most of the time
is just the world because it's
completely based on a hallucination
it's based on anecdotal thinking i know
somebody who parented well they got a
good outcome
therefore
parenting works no you never had a kid
who was a problem kid
it's always the kid
you can't change
kids
have you noticed
that there are kids who are raised
exactly the same way same parents same
family same town same school and they
turn out completely differently have you
seen any families where one of them is a
criminal and one of them is a priest
yes yes you have
okay that's a bad example but
right
every bit of science and evidence is
screaming at us that the parenting isn't
a big deal
it's screaming at you that the
differences in the individual are
everything
now
that difference in the individual which
is being ignored by conservatives
is the same as
when the people on the left ignore human
motivation
it's a blind spot and it makes
everything that you think after that
blind spot nonsense
right
so my problem the reason i'm neither a
democrat nor republican is that you're
operating on different illusions and i
can't buy into a preferred illusion i
mean not one that doesn't work i like
illusions that work for example
um
so here's the other thing you can't fix
up you can't fix a dad by giving him a
 book
you just have to get over that
there's no evidence that's ever worked
there's no evidence that ever will work
none
now i will give you the edge cases i
will give you the education there are
people who don't add a parent and they
learn a little bit better and they get
better and that's good so everybody
should try to get better
but if you think that you can just say
well we already have the solution and
you walk away you're the problem
you're the problem because you
think it's already solved
all all people have to do is try harder
be better parents read a book
trust christ no these are absolute
magical thinking solutions
you can't do any of that stuff if any of
that stuff worked
people would do it
but you have this magic not you so let
me not make this personal personal there
are people who have the magical belief
that you can fix a defective father
with a book or an organization or christ
and i'm going to give you yes you can in
the edge cases but it's nowhere near the
big solution
and sure and sure you should try and
sure you should always have hope
all right uh somebody says i think
you're confusing conservative with a
control freak
no i don't think i am
but i hear what you're saying
all right
all right let me let me give you some of
the bad thinking that i got when i
talked about this
and the reason i'm making a big deal
about this is that
i'm going to give you another analogy
you know how nuclear power was
considered too dangerous
and not really a solution to anything
for decades
and it turns out that that was all an
illusion
nuclear power was the solution for
climate change it is safer than the
other alternatives and most of the
problems have been solved
so you saw me going crazy on
um you know persuading that people to
believe that nuclear power is now the
best solution and now that's the case
right
so you saw both the left
well actually mostly left you saw the
left finally
get past their
illusion
their illusion was nuclear was bad and
now they have they have actually
overcome that
do you know how big a deal it is that
the left has overcome an illusion
the illusion about nuclear power it
probably changes the world
i mean it's really really big
because if we didn't get past that we
weren't in trouble
but we did it looks like we're past it
so nuclear is good now
i'm going to do the same thing or try to
with this myth of the good parent
solving your problems
if you can drop that myth
you open up new possibilities for maybe
finding something that works i don't
know what that is yet i'm just telling
you that you have to drop an illusion
before you can even see the field
you got to get rid of the illusion of
the effective parent
again there are no absolutes here better
parenting is better
right so somebody's going to go away and
say and say scott says the way you
parent doesn't make any difference no no
no i'm not saying that but i know some
people are going to say that
now i'm saying it's not the solution
it's better to pair it better it just
doesn't get a solution solve anything
scott's cognitive
dissonance on display well let me let me
test this if i'm the one who has
cognitive dissonance how do you explain
that parents who are the kids who are
raised exactly the same way can turn out
completely different
if you can explain that
with something that doesn't sound like
nonsense
then you would be right that i would be
the one in cognitive distance but that's
your challenge
now you have to give me one like that in
order to test me
so give me the test
like that and then you can see which one
of us has cognitive distance it's pretty
easy this is pretty easy
all right uh free will of course is an
illusion so if you thought that it was
free will or
uh any of those things those are also
based on hallucinations all right
um
here's the problem
i i once knew this troubled teenager who
ate a ham sandwich
and within a year of eating the ham
sandwich had turned his life around
is that evidence that the ham sandwich
changed this kid's behavior
or is it evidence that some people just
figure it out
it's evidence that some people just
figure it out
so many of you had stories for you for
me about your troubled youth
who you did x or y and whatever x and y
was
it turned that kid around and therefore
doing x and y works
no it doesn't
it's the ham sandwich
all you know is that you did something
and then something happened that's all
you know you don't know that that's what
worked
but you think you do and that illusion
is what is blinding you to the
possibility that there might be some way
to fix this problem
and it's definitely not
the belief that ninety percent of what
you do
parenting makes a difference
you need to reverse that
if you think it's ninety percent about
how you parent and 10 about the genes of
the kid you are completely wrong
reverse it
it's about 90 genes and about 10
parenting
that 10 parenting is going to get you
the following benefits
if you do it right
punctuality maybe
uh good manners
maybe
a preference for hard work maybe
there are definitely some things you can
get from good parenting
and you know loving your spouse maybe
so am i saying that you can't get
anything good from good parenting you
can get all kinds of great stuff yeah
the feeling of security
all kinds of great stuff
but it's in the ten percent in terms of
how much it's going to affect their
their long-term outcomes
are we 90 seconds or less from scott
going full eugenics
does that make sense now what i'm going
to do is i'm going to point out
some of the bad thinking here as my uh
as my argument for how this is
triggering cognitive dissonance in some
of you now one of the comments here was
that
i'm very close to
eugenics did anything i say
suggest that i'm like on the precipice
of eugenics
[Laughter]
no
all right
so here are some uh some of the good
thinking from other other people
um
so here's some some advice i got and i
won't even tell you well no somebody
named john let's just say that
and this tweet it i think this describes
a dominant conservative thought see if
see if you agree with this person's
comment so this is somebody disagreeing
with me on twitter see if you buy into
this
says you meaning me
you understand the problem but not a
solution
that is correct
that's what i'm saying i understand the
problem and nobody has a solution so
that part's good if you want to raise a
child he says
to become a good man be a good man all
right so that's the proposition that you
can turn a child into a boy into a good
man by being a good man
what's the evidence for that
all right we'll keep going your son will
watch you his whole life you want him to
treat women with respect treat his
mother with respect you want him to be a
hard worker
blah blah you show him by going to work
every day
you want to stay away from drug use you
stay away from drug use you want to have
a good marriage with your wife show him
what a good marriage looks like in
essence be a good person every day of
his life and he will be too
make sure your your children know you
love your wife and vice versa show them
what that means the good and the bad and
in between every day
this has a lasting effect on them they
will pick up the habits of the people
they spend time with your bad behavior
will become theirs
so basically the summary of that is that
um
a bad dad
could become a good one
you know by just modeling this good
behavior
how practical is any of that
so
so let's say there's a drug addict who
bangs a woman and then leaves
she has a baby was that meth addict
supposed to
come in and model all these good
behaviors and really show love to the
woman whose last name he doesn't even
know
um and pretend to be
a good husband none of that's real
none of that's real yeah i mean you
start with any real world situation and
you can't imagine how any of this could
work
so the the um the leap of imagination it
takes to go all the way from
uh good parenting is a good thing to
imagine that therefore you can create
good parents
that's thinking past the sale so let me
say it again going back to the first
point
the sale
is can you create good parents
who would do better than bad parents
that's the sale
and the conservatives think all the way
past that that's the part nobody can
figure out they go all the way past it
too it would be good to have two parents
so we're done here
because there are books on how to do it
your whole argument is a straw man no it
isn't
no it isn't
is the straw man the conservatives think
that having a strong two-parent
household is better that's not a
straw man
that is exactly what conservatives think
good lord what is wrong with you
all right
do i have any uh um
personal bias in this story
yes i do
and i'm going to tell you my personal
bias
so you can see
probably one of the reasons that i'm
more or less a engaged in this than
other things you ready
here's a story i've never told before
well i don't know maybe i've told it in
general form to some people
my grandmother used to babysit for me so
it was common if my parents were
busy i would be with my grandmother for
the day when i was a little kid
my grandmother
was a poorly educated woman
and she believed among other things that
if you were born left-handed
it might be the sign of the devil
and so when her son my uncle was born
left-handed
she
punished him until he used his right
hand for general tasks which he ended up
doing
and
and she also believed that all behavior
problems of children
could be solved by enough punishment
so in other words if a child wasn't
doing what you wanted
the only reason is because you had not
you know amped up the punishment enough
so any any any behavior could be fixed
by the right amount of equal punishment
right
now
the problem was that i had a health
problem
which she in her
incredible ignorance
interpreted as a behavior problem
let me say it again i had a health
problem that i couldn't control
it's resolved now so you don't have to
worry about it i'm not going to get into
it it was a health problem and she
believed it was a behavior problem do
you know what she did
when her punishments of me
were not sufficient to change my
behavior because it wasn't something i
had any control of her do you know what
she did she increased the punishment
yeah
and do you know what happened no it
wasn't bedwetting but you know good
guess good guess
so it wasn't bedwetting but if you want
to use that as your model
that would be a good one right because i
don't think anybody intentionally wets a
bed
so so it wasn't that but that's a good
one
all right now what happened when
the new level of punishment wasn't
enough either what did she do
she ramped it up she ramped it up
so my
childhood experience
was literally being trapped in a house
with a torturer
because she believed as you believe many
of you not all of you but she believed
as all conservatives believed she was
conservative
she believed that
good parenting could fix my problems
so my genetic problem
she tried to fix by punishment
and that's that's the model that you
have
the conservative model is that my
grandmother's method should have worked
she just didn't apply enough pressure
right
but sometimes the problem is organic as
it was in my case there was no choice
involved in anything i did there
so if you have a kid who is an addict
is an addict just like everybody else
what do you say conservatives is
somebody who's an addict genetically
just like everybody else
or do they have like a thing that you
can't see
that makes their behavior
look like it's a choice
well if you didn't understand anything
about people and addiction you would say
to yourself
that person is choosing to do those
drugs and i think i can punish them out
of it
how's that going to work
it won't
so the moment you believe that
punishment can correct a genetic
problem
you have a really broken philosophy of
life
once you understand
by the way we're going to get to the
other comments there's somebody here who
says i should be investigated for
killing my son
well the reason i was uh trending on
twitter
is that people like keith olbermann and
you know i think uh
some other people they came in and they
read my tweet
and they interpreted it as i wanted to
kill my own son
or that i did kill my own son or that i
let him die with some neglect or
something now do you imagine that i
actually tweeted anything that said that
this is where that really thing comes in
so you haven't seen my tweet threads
perhaps but you've seen the comments
about them
just ask yourself
really
really do you think that i tweeted in
public
something about being happy
and eddie eddie here says you kind of
did
he goes you kind of did
no i didn't
and that never happened
you you actually are having a
hallucination
go read it again it's in public i mean i
don't have to make a case just go read
it again
see what it says
and if you have problems reading it ask
a friend
the reason it has i know some thousands
of retweets is because there were
thousands of people who read it
correctly
there is not one person who would have
retweeted it
if i was celebrating the death of my
child
right nobody would have retweeted that
so ask yourself why is everybody
retweeting it if you think i'm saying
i'm celebrating the death of my child
right
the problem's on your end
clearly the problem's not your end
nobody would tweet that nobody did
all right
uh let me tell you some of the other
things
um
here here's what somebody else thought i
tweeted this is craig rozaniecki this is
how he interpreted my tweet this morning
he says what you're contending here is
that killing teenage males who are
subjectively deemed dangerous in quotes
and have yet to commit a crime would
serve the greater good so here's
somebody who literally thinks i tweeted
this opinion that killing a teenage male
before they did anything wrong
would be good for society just because
they might be dangerous later
really
really
does somebody think that i tweeted that
opinion
that killing people before they commit a
crime
would be good for society
craig does
craig thinks i actually tweeted that
now can you see the problem
that's cognitive dissonance right so
craig is literally hallucinating some
opinion that nobody would have it's not
it's not only an opinion i don't have
nobody would have that opinion
why would you think anybody would have
that opinion that should have been the
tip-off nobody would have that opinion
so
basically if i said something in a tweet
anytime this week that shocked or
offended you
here's what i can guarantee if you were
shocked or offended by anything i
tweeted
either you didn't understand it
or you're keith olbermann there are two
possibilities now keith as you know is
my mascot and so when i say anything
that trends or is provocative
keith come likes to come over and
misinterpret it and then get worked up
which is part of the fun he's like a
court jester
so i'm always happy to see him
see it's more bad thinking
here's another example
um
here's some advice i got
so how to fix this whole dad problem so
here here's some conservative advice in
the tweet
somebody said it is a spiritual issue
requires the repentance of individual
hearts that eventually multiplies
through society
okay
so
then oh what do i do
okay let me read it again it's a
spiritual issue it requires a repentance
of individual hearts that eventually
multiplies through society
so i
like what do i do differently
how does that help me
all right here's another one
somebody said i don't know how we can
fix it but we can encourage engaged
fatherhood and discourage abandonment
through policy yeah we could have
policies that don't make it like easy
and economical to leave
we could do that so if i understand this
if you fixed our policies to make it
easy you know easier to stay together
and harder to leave
we could
we could create a situation where people
who desperately don't want to be married
have to stay together
that should work out right yeah wouldn't
you love to be a kid of two parents who
desperately don't want to be together
hate each other's guts at this
point with good reason because they were
both shitty to each other but they
stayed together anyway
so i think that'll that'll be good
good for the kid
do you see any problems
no
this is the quality of a lot of
conservative thought you can just
encourage people to stay together
why the would you want to do that
is that the only way you could make this
worse the only way you can make it worse
is keeping that father in the
house
the guy who left
i don't think mom wanted him
i don't think anybody wanted him there's
a reason he left he's a leaver
the fact that he left probably shows you
something about what would happen if he
stayed
right
to imagine that you can fix a problem by
putting horrible role models really
close to your kid
does not seem like good thinking
that is not a philosophical
preference
that's just illogical
it doesn't think through what happens if
the guy stays as the guy stays
what abuse bad role model
all right here's some more bad thinking
uh as the father of an adolescent son
who struggles with substance abuse and
self-harm i appreciate your wise message
that there is no hope what yeah it's
he's being sarcastic it's good that
there is someone as smart as you to set
us right
so he's saying he has a son with
things and he believes that what i said
is there's no hope no
there's tons of hope you know what the
hope is
the hope is that your kid has good genes
and that he's going through a rough
patch
it's very very common for young men to
go through a rough patch
anybody is there anybody who was a young
man
who went through a rough patch and then
worked it out
any of you
any any conservatives here who went
through a rough patch and then worked it
out
yes
so would you lose hope knowing that i
mean i'm just their yeses streaming
through here right man and women right
it's not not limited to men of course
it's the most common thing why would i
tell somebody to lose hope
when it's extremely common
for people going through a rough patch
to get out of it
but do you know you can usually tell
which people those are
not always
but there are people you look at and you
say okay that one's not going to get out
of it
but there are other ones you say i think
that one could
i feel like this one's just going
through a rough batch but you know if
you get this one through it i think they
can make it work there are others you
know they can't
you know but you could hope so yes
there's always hope
i'm never going to be the one to tell
you not there's no hope
all right
um
so i guess that's
all right
i guess that's my main point those those
of you who are parents
and you're good at it
and you also got good results
shut the up you're ruining
everything
let me say it again those of you are
really good parents
and you did all the right things and you
got a good outcome with your parents you
need to shut the up
because you're you're ruining everything
because you're operating under the
illusion that you got good outcomes
because you're good parenting
you're so wrong
you're so wrong your good parenting
helped and i applaud you for it and i
and i'm very
impressed by anybody who's good at it
because i'm not i wouldn't say that i'm
good at it
so
i'm very impressed with good parenting
but stop telling us that's what worked
that's not what worked
what worked is you got lucky
you got lucky
you had two kids and they both worked
out what would you have said if you
treated two kids exactly the same and
one of them became a criminal and a drug
addict and the other one did not
why would you say that in good parents
would you say them you only parented one
of them well
is that what you'd say
no
you would change your opinion to my
opinion if you had that experience
your opinion would immediately change to
oh it doesn't matter what i do
wouldn't it just think about it
you're a great parent
one of your kids turns out great the
other one doesn't and you're treating
them the same as far as you can tell
you would immediately change your
opinion about the importance of
parenting because you would see it with
your own eyes i'm doing everything right
but it's not working
so all of you parents who got have two
good kids let's say just an example and
you did good parenting and they turned
out great shut the up you're
ruining the country you're the reason
we're not looking for other solutions
you are causing an illusion
to fall over the eyes of other people to
make them think that god all i have to
do is this easy stuff all i have to do
is this easy stuff and i'll get good
good results just like these good
parents no
you good parents
shut the up
you're destroying the country
by your illusion
that what you did
got you the right
now the cognitive dissonance is pretty
strong over on youtube this is an
interesting difference you'll uh you
can't see both platforms but i get to
see the comments on both
on
on the subscription service
this is a a population of people who
have a higher level
of critical thinking
and the reason i know that is it's what
we talk about every day they're
literally in class
for critical thinking
and so when i give this point you i look
at the comments on locals and mostly
they're agreeing
because they've you know they've studied
critical thinking enough
to get there on
youtube
i see john just yelling wrong
in all caps
so so john let's let's take john john
you're yelling wrong in all caps
give me
a one sentence reason it doesn't have to
be complete
but just give me like a sense of what i
got wrong just like what's what's the
part i got wrong john
because otherwise you're just
experiencing cognitive dissonance and
you're proving it well john got really
quiet
now john i'm asking you you're on john
the floor is yours
i'm wrong about all of it
just tell me what part one sentence is
easy
just good oh john went away john
disappeared when john had to actually
explain his opinion in public
he disappeared
so somebody's saying that it's 90
percent about genes is dead wrong well
let me let me make the argument about 90
about genes
that's the reason that two kids turn out
differently different genes
right
now if you have an answer to how that
can happen
same parenting two different outcomes if
you have an answer to that
john just answered twice
all right let's see
john john answer twice
let's see where he is there's so many
comments here i have to go back
you are blaming conservatives there's no
reason john
okay john that's not a reason
i'm blaming conservatives that's not a
reason or an argument
okay john john is just in cognitive
disappearance so he believes he's giving
me answers but he's just
like saying words
have you noticed that presidents always
take credit for what happens
that's good and they always blame the
other guy for what happened bad
you know none of that's real right
you know that um biden isn't exactly
responsible for all of the inflation he
he didn't help
but you know we accept that the people
in charge are causing all the outcomes
that's not real you know that's not real
um
well i told you this would be an
uncomfortable show
now let me ask this question
is there anybody here who
watched this who had a traditional
conservative view when i started
and at this point is asking themselves
holy did i get everything wrong and
the parenting doesn't make that much
difference
is anybody asking themselves that
question
this is a stream of no's
nope nope nope few yeses
that's about what i'd expect
a little bit
all right
this is like day one of convincing
people that nuclear power is a good idea
on day one you know you don't get much
impact
on youtube is it all news
best show ever
interesting if one of my kids turns out
to be a mass shooter or a drug addict i
will take responsibility for it as their
parents but responsibility is not even
the topic is it
see that that's another
thinking like a logic hiccup
nobody was talking about responsibility
it wasn't even a topic
can bad parenting destroy a kid of
course
of course here's what i think there are
plenty of people who made it through bad
situations
but i think it's the kid
it's the kid
um
yeah
and let me ask you this how many of you
have uh children
that turned down completely different
but were parented the same let me ask
you that question because that's the key
question
in the comments how many of you have
children where you parrot them the same
and they turned out differently
yes yes yes yes
how is that not the end of the
conversation
seriously
because when i asked you if i'd
convinced you know anybody i got mostly
no's
but when i ask you have you raised
parents and learned for yourself with
your own eyes
that the same treatment gets you
different outcomes
you al it's mostly yeses
how do you explain that if you know that
parenting doesn't get you the same
outcome
how do you think that parenting gets you
the same outcome
because you know it doesn't
how can you say two things that you know
are to be opposite and you and many
people i think set them in the last five
minutes
you'll always raise your second child
differently
not different in the ways that matter
i see what you're saying somebody saying
that you raised the second child
differently than first and i think i
think that's the thing
and i can see that that would have some
small differences but i don't think it
makes one of them a drug addict
that seems like a bridge too far
um
[Music]
somebody says we all got parented the
same that's why we're all drug addicts
no you're mostly likely drug addicts
because your parents have those genes
if you know somebody whose parents both
have the alcoholic gene
do you know anybody like that both
parents and leo both of their family
members they're all alcoholics
are you gonna make that go away with
good parenting
no
now unfortunately if they got the gene
and they have access to alcohol it's
going to go in that direction
right alcoholism is about genetics
you truly don't understand our framing
says greg
um greg i don't think everybody's
framing it the same but say more about
that
so that's that's the kind of so that's
the kind of comment that i consider
additive it's incomplete
but it's additive so
so somebody's saying i don't understand
the conservative framing
so that's a good start
um
where are you going to that
different friends that's in experiences
right which would also argue that it's
not the parenting
so if let's say your kids also have
different friends and the friends are a
big influence which of course they are
that would be one reason for a different
outcome but again the point is it wasn't
the parents
that's my point it wasn't the parents
all right i guess that i don't uh
oh you're framing this as a conservative
problem
oh okay let me address that so the issue
is that i'm framing it as a conservative
problem i um
here's
here's the slight nuance that i think
can get you on my side john
i'm not saying that only conservatives
have this blind spot
i'm saying that the conservatives
focusing on this
blinds us to the possibility that there
might be some way to solve it that we
haven't thought about in other words it
makes us makes us focus
on something that looks like a solution
when in fact it's not
now the part that's unique to
conservatives is that they talk about it
right so what is not unique to
conservatives is that they're in this
situation
everybody could be in the situation
what's different is that the
conservatives and i think you'd agree
with this as as a political
point is one of their main points
but the left does not make it a main
point to have two parents did
is that okay
does that fix the framing the framing is
just who's focusing on it and i think
you'd agree on that
what are the other solutions
uh
i don't know
but i'll tell you the process for
finding a better solution
the process first would be to understand
the limits of what parenting can do
compared to your genes and their other
outside experience we should understand
what the limits of that are that's very
big so education on that point secondly
a b test
this is my answer for everything
and this is the perfect situation
and one of the things i would test would
be group parenting
group parenting
so that's something that accidentally
happened in my life in my first marriage
just by complete coincidence
the two step-kids
had
friends who there were two two in the
family that were the same ages and same
genders and so there were i think four
or so families
that had kids that were same age best
friends same genders and so
you could all take turns being parents
so one day they'd all be at my house and
i was the parent
next day they'd all be at you know
quinn's house and he's the parent
and so the kids would get
complete role models from a variety of
people and i would
i would actually ask my own uh step kids
like who do they see as like really
strong parents and they would name
somebody they'd say oh yeah
they usually say my friend quinn
actually uh if you listen to this quinn
by the way that's the first time you
heard that
um
the the kids would actually say oh yeah
quinn he's great like
best dad
but i don't think that he would have
made a difference with
my step-kid
and i do think he's a great dad i think
he does it you know as well as it could
be done
at least as far as i can observe
all right
i feel like i uh
got to the end of that
point now
let me ask you this question
do you think
that i've made a case that there's an
illusion there about genes versus
parental influence without degrading the
fact that the parental influence is very
important very important i'm totally
with you on that
it just isn't the big thing
all right
so
if i've made that point
then maybe that can free you up to at
least consider we should try some other
things
and i think the other things are going
to have to do more with bringing more
people into it right it could be
something about how to fix schools
because i it's my it's my observation
the schools socialize your kid more than
parents
right it'd be hard to measure that i
guess it depends what age you're talking
about etc at the youngest age it's the
parents only
at some point it's the school almost
only
by the time they're teenagers
so if you were to fix the school system
so it let's say could it could plug in
some of the blocks of
you know whatever resources are needed
or education that would help so there
are lots of things you could try
but you're not going to know if they
work until you try them so i say try a
bunch of stuff
record your observations see works
yeah i wouldn't don't look to me to have
answers i can only tell you processes
for finding answers which is good
yeah i think i think the whole it takes
the village thing was right on point and
i think that we just i mean it wasn't
really implemented in any useful way
is that a nanny state i would say the
opposite
opposite it would be more like uh
individuals getting together for mutual
benefit
and it does seem to me that uh you know
families getting together for mutual
benefit is exactly what i did so like
the experience i described was exactly
that bunch of families
coordinated their activities for the
benefit of all involved
and i thought it was awesome it was a
great way to live
and i don't know there's i'm pretty sure
you can reproduce it all you have to do
is do a little matchmaking to
create what happened to me accidentally
that can only work organically
yeah but somebody would have said that
about online dating at one point too
you know you you imagine the online
dating let's say the first day anybody
invented it
people would say that's not going to
work i need to meet people in person the
organic way but online dating does work
and people get married and they like it
so you could certainly match
families
with some kind of an online app
scott equals hillary clinton
in that one way
in that one way that i think that
bringing in outside resources to help a
family that doesn't have all the
resources they need
it actually
how is that not conservative
somebody just blamed me of being hillary
clinton and it just occurred to me that
i'm
expressing the most conservative thing
anybody could ever say
like
deal with your neighbors and be good to
each other
try to help out your neighbor your
neighbor tries to help out you
is that is that communist
if your friends help you put up a barn
are you communists
because you're going to help them right
like they help you put up your barn
maybe you help them when they need to
put up a barn is that communist or is
that christian
that feels conservative to me
so just because hillary clinton said you
need a village that doesn't make it
wrong
doesn't make it wrong
all right
um
it's distributed versus centralized yeah
i guess that makes a difference all
right
did you check out the abortion jokes on
drudge report abortion jokes
i wish i had not read that comment
you know you know as a professional
humorist i don't have too many
guard rails on what i think is funny
if you do it professionally
you know you get tired of you know
g-rated material and you want something
edgy
and
you know the edgier the better but i
don't think
i could ever laugh at an abortion joke
that's just me i mean if you want to i'm
not going to complain about it
somebody says check it out are they
actually funny
they're actually funny
i don't know maybe
all right the jokes are not on drudge
they're
i don't know
now i like you even more well thank you
i laugh about holocaust jokes somebody
says
now too soon too soon
john says in all capital letters if
scott couldn't properly parent no one
can
john i would like to call you out as
exhibit a
of
what's destroying the country
it's you john
it's the people who say the good
parenting
that'll fix everything
you are the problem
uh evil genes is a book i guess that
teaches you that some people are just
unfixable right
what age were your kids i don't want to
talk about that
elon musk doesn't pass the
theranos therapist
i don't know
i'm still uh plus on elon musk i haven't
seen anything that would change that
your traditional conservative view is
misinformed
does anybody think that i misstated
conservative opinion about the
value of the
two-parent home
did i miss a conservative opinion
somebody says yes a little bit what
would be the what would you add to it or
change
yes you always do what would you add to
interchange for those for those of you
say it's misstated
you could you may now
um
oh i see
conflating nuclear no i'm not conflating
them
too binary no it's not binary i never
presented it as binary i always
presented it as a spectrum
that would be on you not on
me um
the 100 person 90
public eye conservatives with normies
biological doubt dads have profound
influence
of course they do i'm not disagreeing
um
you conflate abusive pony well hold on
you conflated abusive punishment with
conservative ideas of good parenting no
i didn't no i didn't do that
so
who would do that who would do that
well just ask me really
really
did i did i say that abusive parenting
and parenting were sort of the same
thing of course not
nobody did that
i'm saying abusive parenting exists
that's all and you don't disagree with
it so i'm going to conclude that what
you think is me not understanding
conservatism is you not understanding
what i said
you did
i conflated abusive parenting with just
good parenting you thought you actually
saw that
did you because i talked about people
who are good parents
and i talked about people who are bad
parents
is that conflating them
no the grim the grandmother's story
all right here's the problem
let me give you a general statement for
understanding me and everybody else
you must go through life very confused
if you think people are talking in
absolutes because you heard it that way
if you heard something as an absolute
that's not on me
let me say that again
if you thought i said something as an
absolute
that's not on me because i don't speak
that way and never have and never will
there are no absolutes so if your
complaint
is that i said that all
all parenting is abusive if you think
you heard that that's completely on you
nobody would say that
literally nobody would say that and i
certainly didn't
but i did make a point
that there are some parents who are very
bad and they can't tell the difference
between
a behavior problem and
something else
yeah don't believe your lying ears
you're making
uh they're making you respond to the
lowest common denominator yeah
uh you chose the village okay
you claimed more punishment is the
conservative strategy nope nope no that
is that is your imagination
i claimed that there was one person with
with that to thought
if you thought
that i said every conservative is like
my grandmother that's completely on you
completely on you no it's not inferred
here's why it's not inferred
it's never inferred it can't be inferred
it's not inferred by me it's not
inferred by the next person you hear
talking nobody ever infers absolute if
you believe somebody in
right land bain that says you did now if
you if you believe that anybody else is
talking in absolutes especially me
you have a problem and you need to deal
with it it's not my problem
all right there is no way
that you should interpret
anything like this conversation in
absolute sense
that's all on you i'm sorry it's all on
you
uh
did your parents know about your bad
grandmother uh not until later
when you're real little you know when
you're five years old
you just think anything's normal you
don't know what to do about it
all right i think i'm being addicted to
your disagreement so that's not good
what was the purpose of the
grandmother's story
the purpose of the grandmother's story
which apparently got lost on some people
the purpose of the grandmother's story
is that she couldn't tell the difference
between what was my genetic makeup and
what was my choice
she couldn't tell between my choice and
my genetic makeup
and that
is the problem that conservatives in
general have
not everyone
well thank you wilma
you claimed your grandmother adopted a
conservative strategy that is a
conservative strategy
did you think it was universal
did you think it was absolute
because that's on you
it is absolutely a conservative strategy
that you meet bad behavior with
punishment
is that wrong
it's not a conservative strategy to
punish bad behavior
did that change
so he says no it isn't come on
are you just arguing just argue
seriously it is not a conservative
strategy to
uh
to have penalties for wrongdoing
okay you're not being serious now
you're not being serious of course it is
of course it is
jesus christ
an example an example is raising
children
it is a conservative belief that if they
do bad things you give them consequences
like you act like you act like that's
not a thing anymore or something oh my
god all right so i think we're just in
cognitive dissonance at this point we
can't fix this
um
do democrats punish bad behavior
and the answer
is no
now when i said that did you say that's
an absolute he's saying that there's no
there's no
no it's never a absolute it's
never an absolute
we're talking in general
every conversation you have about
conservatives versus
liberals is always in general
right yeah you know a guy you know a guy
who's not like that it doesn't that's
not the
you're not helping
that's not helping
that you know a guy who's an exception
let me ask you this
who's in favor of letting people out of
jail
more democrats than
uh republicans right it's a generality
who's in favor of letting kids just make
their own decisions and be free-range
chickens
is it in general more of the left or in
general more the right it's in general
the left right if you can't deal with
generalities
and you insist that i'm talking in
absolutes so you can find some
problem to complain about
do not be part of the solution because
you don't have the skills
if you can't understand that people
almost never talk in absolutes
and that's what's hanging you up
oh that's an absolute his grandmother
represents all conservatives
no
um
the modest proposal here
all right
so you had a grandma that's funny
well thank you
i'm right about this one
all right
um the strategy wasn't flawed your
grandmother was
all right
here's the problem
could my grandmother have been smart
enough to know
what was a genetic problem and what was
the behavioral problem
because nobody else knew
nobody else knew
i mean it looked like a behavioral
problem i i'll have to admit that it
looked like it
so no
that wasn't hurt
wasn't even a problem with my
grandmother
really
all right that is all i have today i
believe
i've cursed enough and i have
made my point
now given that you watch this live
stream to be challenged
which is why it doesn't have a million
viewers
it would be easy to have a million
viewers do you know how easy it would be
for me to have millions of viewers it'd
be easy i'll just say what one side
believed
i would just keep telling them what they
wanted here it's easy
i mean anybody can be
i'm not going to name names
i was going to name names of some of
your favorite people
who are making a lot of money and doing
great by saying all the obvious stuff i
could do that
but it doesn't feel like it adds value
all right
and i'm going to end by now
and youtube i'll talk to you tomorrow
