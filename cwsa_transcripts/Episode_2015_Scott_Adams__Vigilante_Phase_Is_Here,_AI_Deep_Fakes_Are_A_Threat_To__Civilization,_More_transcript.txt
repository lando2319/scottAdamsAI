good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization so far and
don't get used to civilization because
it's not going to last much longer
well actually today is mostly about
funny stuff
a lot of funny stuff going on so we'll
talk about it
but if you would like to take your
experience up to well I don't want to
say orgasmic but something like it
all you need is a cup of a glass of
tanker chalice or style the canteen joke
or flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine and the day the
thing that makes absolutely everything
better except Lady Gaga's show
and it's called the simultaneous step
and it happens now go
I only mentioned Lady Gaga's show
because there's something she's included
that's so grotesque I'm not even going
to mention it
because if you haven't read about it
don't don't read about it nope do not
read about it
seriously it won't make you happy to
find out what she does on stage don't
don't look into it if you see an article
just look away
that's my only advice
so what else is happening today
let's find out if I had a printer I
would be looking at my printed notes but
I'll have one in a few days
all right I saw a meme that might be
useful to some of you how many of you
have ever been referred to or maybe even
you're referred to yourself as far right
is there anybody here who's ever been
called
far right
you have all right
or here's a reframe
um I didn't make this one up this is
somebody's meme so I guess we don't know
who made it up because it's just a meme
but the reframe goes like this you keep
calling me far right but I think you
mean right so far
right so far
it's pretty good you know what I like
about it
what I like about it is it doesn't take
itself seriously
and I feel like
I don't know if we're ever going to
leave our teams you know we're always
locked into our teams whatever they are
but we could at least have a sense of
humor about it
right if you if you're going to be on a
team you might as well enjoy it
all right um I saw a tweet from Ben
Collins NBC News and uh I hope the
following story is true
now if it's like every other story about
something that happened behind closed
doors
it's not true
here we'll go private over here
so I'm assuming it's not exactly true
but boy do I want this one to be true
all right The Story Goes Like This
that Elon Musk was talking to his
engineers at Twitter
and he was complaining that he has more
than 100 billion followers
but some of his recent tweets are only
getting tens of thousands of impressions
now what do you think does that sound
natural and normal
he has I think 126 million followers
and some of his tweets were only getting
tens of thousands of Impressions now I
don't mean retweets
not retweets I mean people even sought
you think that sounds right
so uh musk goes to his engineers
and is asking them to figure out why why
his impressions are so low
one of the engineers reportedly
reportedly
I would say I wouldn't put a lot of
credibility on this story but it's fun
story so I'll tell it to you anyway
reportedly one of the engineers
suggested that the reason that musk is
getting less
Impressions fewer impressions
is because he's less interesting to the
public now
and apparently Elon musk's reply was
you're fired
you're fired I think he sent it twice
that's the way it's reported you're
fired
you're fired
I I don't know which way he said the
two-year fires because there's lots of
ways to do it you're fired
you're fired right every way you do it's
kind of funny this is the second year
fire that really sells it you know
you're fired
straightforward but you're fired you are
fired
like all of those are good
now here's why I have to take uh musk's
side on this story that may or may not
be true which is
when Elon Musk interacts with any of my
tweets as he's done a number of times
now
any any interaction by Elon Musk on my
tweet
can get me over a million impressions
so do you really think it's organic that
when he he does some minor comment on my
Twitter tweets
I'll get a million impressions
but when it's his own account he might
get tens of thousands does that sound
even even like slightly possible no oh
there's clearly something wrong and I
love the fact that he that he just
wasn't willing to even hear the argument
that maybe he was wrong about that
because he's not wrong he's not wrong
you're fired
all right well that was funny
um if you follow me on Twitter you may
have seen a uh Machiavelli's underbelly
whose Twitter account you should follow
and
um he's a he's he does a lot of deep
fakes for entertainment so you can just
see how good the Deep fakes are because
now the AI can do a almost perfect
impression of anybody's voice
and it can do really a perfect
rendering of what they look like from
any angle and then it can animate them
the Deep fakes now can talk
and even AI can write some of the
dialogue
so you know you can give us some
suggestions it can write the dialogue
imitate the voice and show you a nearly
perfect rendering of the person so
there's an example of Jack posabek a
deep fake version of him giving a fake
endorsement of me for uh California
Senate now here's my comment on this
when I look at that version
of Jack pasonic
I would say roughly speaking it's 99
perfect
I'd be interested
you know in your take on it but to me
it's 99 perfect now the good news is and
the good news won't last long
but the good news
is that humans can detect a one percent
imperfection kind of easily pretty
easily it just steps right out right
humans are really good at seeing
something that's just slightly off with
a human being
and that's what the uncanny valley is
all about
but we've crossed The Uncanny Valley
so The Uncanny Valley is where the
imitation of a person is sort of like a
person but it's not close enough to look
like a person so it looks grotesque like
you get so close to the person that
you're like oh it's like is that a
monster or did a zombie take over their
brain it's like a person but it's not
quite ah it's all gross
but when you look at these deep fakes
they've actually crossed that barrier
they're they're already in the yeah
those look like people I'm totally
willing to say that's a person that's
not if you look at the the Jack posabic
deep fake it doesn't look
creepy
it doesn't look creepy it actually just
looks like
you know a person talking
so
we're one percent away from not being
able to tell the difference
one percent away here's what people
don't understand
as long as we're one percent away we all
know they're fake or or we could be
convinced or fake quite easily if
somebody points it out to you you can
see it
when it gets one percent better
just one percent
when the Deep fakes get one percent
better
they're not going to be one percent
better
does everybody get that
when they improve the next one percent
it's not going to be one percent better
all of the other one percents were one
percent better
when it went from 56 to 57 is good
it was you know one percent better
right it was one percent better
but when it goes from 99 percent
like a person to you can't tell the
difference
it will change civilization
completely
we don't know how
we do not know how
first of all it could affect employment
because why would you ever talk to a
customer service person when you could
talk to an AI
it will affect dating
because we're at the point where AI can
write continuous dialogue and have a
conversation with you looking like
exactly whoever you want them to look
like
a dead relative dead spouse do you know
how many people are going to have
full-on relationships with a with a
deceased spouse
there will be people who couldn't let go
you know somebody was lost early lost
Young
yeah there will be widows and widowers
we're just going to bring them back
they'll be on the TV
but they'll be there all the time
every time you walk into your TV there
will be your loved one
and they might recognize you from you
know motion capture or something and
they might say hey how you doing good to
see you
too bad I'm trapped in this computer and
then eventually that that will be moved
to robots and sex bots
I don't think we quite are ready
for how big this change is going to be
and it's also completely unpredictable
you know I'm giving you one vision of
what might happen but it could be
completely opposite of that you don't
know something big big big is about to
happen and the only point I want to make
is that that last one percent isn't one
percent
it's a hundred percent
the last one percent is a hundred
percent everything is going to be
different and we might only be
weeks away from that
do you hear that we might be weeks away
from just weeks away from that one
percent being closed
um
so get ready for that now
um on the same topic
market value is underbelly also did the
funniest thing that I've seen
probably in a year
and I've seen a lot of funny things in
the last year and it's a a deep fake
which shows purports to show Brett
Weinstein and his spouse Heather ire I
have a conversation on what appears to
be their podcast about themselves
now some of it some of it the AI wrote
with some prompting human prompting but
it's the funniest thing
I've ever seen just
because
there's like a story that there's the
thing they're talking about but the the
understory is their uh personal
reactions to each other that's written
by the AI and with the human product and
their their personal asides are so
freaking funny that that I was just
crying when I was watching it now
I I want to be clear it's not really
mocking you know in case you think it's
mocking the individuals it's not really
it's just having fun with you know they
they have unique personalities and
I hope I hope that they're not insulted
by it because I you know if it had been
me I would have been laughing pretty
hard and I think they have a sense of
humor so so I think they'll like you
fine
all right so you have to watch that I
was going to play a little bit of it but
it's kind of long and you really want to
settle in it will be the funniest thing
you've seen in a long time I promise you
that
all right we're entering the Vigilante
phase of
of History
um Governor Greg Abbott reports uh he
tweeted this is outrageous Texas offer
officers broke up a major Houston
fentanyl operation that could have
killed thousands of people
but a day after four suspects were
arrested they were released on bond by a
Houston judge we must end easy bail for
criminals
now
how many times are fentanyl dealers
going to be released
before some parent who lost
a child to fentanyl
and also is heavily armed
takes it upon themselves I'm not
recommending this not recommending it
do not do not take up personal arms
against any civilians don't do it
but it's going to happen right
how could it not happen
I'm kind of surprised it hasn't happened
already
feels weird
like they're you know if we can have a a
mass shooting you know three times every
weekend apparently whatever it is we're
having a lot of mass shootings we have
all those angry crazy Mass shooters
and not one of them
is an angry parent
none of them
I mean it just feels like there are too
many guns too many crazy people and too
many fentanyl dealers getting out on
bail
for the good people to completely ignore
this forever
I I don't we're moving pretty close to
vigilantism now one one good
way to judge the quality of your system
you know your legal system your
Constitution is how close are you to
vigilantism
this is the closest I've ever seen well
maybe was it when was uh
was it the 60s with Branson in that
movie
yeah Bernard gets 70s yeah so maybe
since the 70s is the closest we've been
but we have a lot more guns than we did
in the 70s Death Wish was the movie
right
so here's the thing I would watch for
if it happens once and it makes the news
it probably will kick off copycats
because that's the problem with the mass
shootings the mass shootings are all
driven by the news
would you agree
would you all agree that the news drives
mass shootings
because I don't think they would think
of it like it wouldn't occur to you that
that's a thing to do unless you saw it
on the news
yeah because not even video games are
not even about
mass shootings
so it's not really you can't say it
comes from media you know gun use comes
from media but not vigilanteism
and not uh yeah you know
all right so
I think that's where we're adding on
that
um here's where I could imagine it
happening
it might be that the thing that's
holding up back vigilantism is that
murderers all get caught these days
do you think that's it in the 70s you
can murder somebody in the street and
you had a pretty good chance of getting
away from away with it wouldn't you
agree
in the 70s
you just kill somebody your your odds of
getting away with murder were pretty
good
but if you were to kill somebody today
your odds of getting caught are really
high
really high
so it could be it could be that we'll
not see vigilantism because it just
can't work and people don't want to
commit suicide they're they want to kill
somebody else
so maybe that's what's holding you back
but here's something that might change
that
three technologies that are almost
certainly going to come together
but I want you to give me a technical
fact check on this because there's part
of this I think
I might be wrong about and you'll tell
me okay
um obviously drones are a big thing
anybody can get a drone and drones will
be doing all kinds of dangerous military
things do you think it's inevitable that
individuals will be able to buy drones
that can kill people
would you call that inevitable now they
might have to buy it on you know the
Silk Road or you know buy it illegally
but you can buy every manner of illegal
gun
so don't you think that you'll have
drones that are sort of heavy sized
they would be able to shoot a bullet
yeah I mean obviously there will be guns
that can shoot in a bullet
now
do you think there will be drones that
have facial recognition built in
of course of course
do you think there will be drones that
have uh independent operation meaning
that you could say here here's the
address I want you to go to
go there and fly around until you see
this person you're looking for and shoot
them in the head
of course
it's all doable so you just know where
the person's house is
send your drone over have a hover and
wait for the guy to come out to his car
and then if he doesn't come out while
the Drone is there you know before it
runs out of energy it goes home
tries again the next day you know
because you kind of know when you know
when he goes to work maybe so you hang
around when you know that's what do you
think he's going to be outside
do it two or three days
you know no no strikes but let's say the
last day it picks up facial recognition
shoots him in the head
now here's the part
that I need your technical instructions
on
is it possible in 2023 to pay for
something and not be traceable
is that even a thing without cash
can you buy something in 2023 even with
crypto
even with crypto
can it all be dark web
but the dark web you could still Trace
somebody if you knew what to look for
right
all right so some of you think that
there's a way to do it all right here's
cash I don't know it'd be a lot of cash
Monero so there's something called
Monero that I've never heard of but it
sounds like
sounds like a untraceable crypto
if somebody actually wanted it all right
so here's my prediction that if we keep
letting terrible criminals out of jail
there will be a market where a person
can anonymously hire a killer drone
upload a picture
and have it go kill somebody you want
and then Vigilantes will start using
them to kill
to kill fentanyl dealers as they walk
out of jail
they'll be killed on the steps of the
jail they won't even get to the bottom
of the steps
all right that's my prediction I don't
know when that'll happen
all right I saw a tweet thread today
that just blew my freaking mind
because it reframed something
so right
that like it'll it'll never leave my
mind now and it's a permanent part of my
thinking
I don't know the person who did the
thread it's the Twitter name is cat girl
culock
um
so and the Twitter Twitter name is at
from coolock
k-u-l-a-k one word from gulak now I
followed I followed I assume it's her I
followed her as soon as I saw this
because uh it was amazing
all right so here's the basic argument
um it's a very long thread it's worth
saying America has two constitutions
and you only know about one
are you interested like right away
that's interesting isn't it what do you
mean
do you think anybody could actually make
an argument that there are two
constitutions
do you think that's even an argument
anybody can make oh yeah you didn't know
it but there's this other Constitution
well the other Constitution
according to this is the uh
uh the social right what was it called
the civil rights legislation in the uh
from the 60s
so the Civil Rights stuff every you know
it seemed like that was a subset of our
existing Constitution just something we
could do we could make laws and stuff so
that that's all within the Constitution
but
the part that we didn't see coming
is that it requires a whole structure of
people working in jobs
that are spotting um
discrimination
and then deciding what to do about it
so once you've created a separate
structure of people looking for
discrimination
the people who look for the
discrimination and decide where it is
and where it isn't effectively have
control of the country
that's the second Constitution
because they have control effectively
of the country
because they can just say what you're
doing is is discrimination so you can't
do it
well what where's your Constitution now
or they can say that's good and that's
bad
that's what our Constitution's supposed
to be doing not that
right so in effect while this was an
unintended consequences there grew up a
structure that is in effect a second
Constitution
and as long as we have two constitutions
we're just not effective as a country
and that we're probably at a point where
we have to get rid of that to survive
now I've always said the following
the the heavy hand of discrimination
laws probably made sense
like there was a time when it made sense
it was it was smarter to do it than not
do it it was better for everybody to do
it
that doesn't last forever
if you succeed in getting your
discrimination down to at least within
you know spitting distance you know
you're at least you're in the ballpark
where let's say an educated black man is
going to do better than an uneducated
white man like nothing's nothing's ever
completely you know fair or equal but
you know you're in the ballpark in 2023.
if you're in the ballpark
that second Constitution is all bad
now I'm not sure we're exactly there
where it's all bad but it's starting to
look that way
it's starting to look like the more
attention we give to discrimination as
much of a problem as as it is and has
been then it only makes it worse
that's probably where we're at
yeah
so
on the same topic
there's a good follow on Twitter a
British fellow named Dr Joel Brown
and Dr Joel Brown is black and he lists
himself as a Christian Centrist critical
thinker staff writer and medical doctor
and singer songwriter
all right so just consider those
qualifications medical doctor
singer songwriter staff writer Christian
Centrist critical thinker and good
Tweeter too he's a good follow
and he said that he's looking he wants
to meet a white supremacist because he's
never met one
do you think he can
do you think you can meet an actual
white supremacist
because I had to explain to him on
Twitter
that they don't exist anymore they used
to
there used to be plenty of them but now
they've evolved
there are plenty of racists let me be
clear plenty of racists and plenty of
them are white you know they're racists
of all types plenty of white racists but
in 2023 you're not going to find one who
says white people do all things better
than all other people
that's no longer a thing
I'm pretty sure there was a day when a
white supremacist would have said
there's no way those black people will
ever be good at sports
right
that was actually a thing
I mean it sounds ridiculous today but
there was a time when they thought now
there's no way they're going to be good
at sports
you know no no way they're going to
become president well there you go no
way there's going to be a famous TV
physicist who's also black well there is
no way they're going to dominate you
know music and a lot of other
you know entertainment industry is about
what they do they do so my comment to
him and and then the good doctor Jill
Brown
asked me what changed like why would it
change what would change it critical
thinking better education and I said no
just observation
it would be impossible to live in the
model of modern world and not notice
that black people not everyone but
plenty of black people are doing better
than the white supremacists if you're a
white supremacist how can you not notice
that black people are outperforming you
you personally you personally are not in
the NBA you personally did not make a
hit record with yay you personally did
not become president with Obama right
so
how in the world could a white
supremacist not notice that
and now to be clear plenty of regular
racists plenty of regular races
but they're the flavor these days or
they believe that white people are
somewhere in the middle
do you buy that that the racist in 2023
believes that white people if you were
to erect or performance would be
somewhere in the middle
there there's no I don't think there's
any racist who thinks your generic white
person is going to be at the top of
academic performance
or Sports
or entertainment
or anything else
am I am I wrong
so somebody's saying I underestimate
stupid people but let me make a
clarification
there was a time in history
where an educated white person
could be a white supremacist
and be rational but wrong
that you know they rationally they say
well observationally you know we see one
group doing better they would have been
wrong
but it wasn't like crazy thinking it was
just wrong
in 2023 you would have to be flat out
stupid
to imagine that white people are
outperforming all the other groups and
all the categories or anything like it
now of course white supremacy gets used
in two different senses
one sense is that there are just too
many things that favor white people
because of the historical way things
evolved you can make an argument for
that
you know I I might debate some of it but
you can make an argument for it it's not
a crazy argument you know that's
basically systemic racism
but the actual individual thinking
they're superior to the other individual
that doesn't exist
except for extremely stupid people and
if you're calling stupidity racism I
think that's overthinking it it's just
stupidity that
you know it informs all of their
decisions race is just one of the things
they're stupid about they're also not
good at math maybe right so I don't
think you should call it stupidity
racism
racism would just be one of the many
things that they get wrong because
they're stupid
all right well that's what I say there's
a Shinzo Abe the now deceased and
assassinated
uh prime minister
what does Japan have prime minister
right
yeah right pregnancies
um
and he had a book that he'd written but
it was not released while he was alive
so his his widow allowed it and he's got
some criticisms of trump and Trump's
approach to North Korea
and the way it's being reported is that
uh
you know obviously this is Abe's telling
of it but Abe thought that uh Trump was
too soft on North Korea
and that the only thing that could
denuclearize North Korea is the threat
that America would uh put a Tomahawk
missile on Kim's house and kill him and
his family and that would be the only
thing that Kim would worry about and
therefore without that threat nothing
would happen
to which I say
I wonder if Shinzo Abe remembers the
past 60 years of that not working
did he not notice decades and Decades of
that not working being hard on North
Korea
so instead Trump took you know ignored
all of their thinking and simply
befriended
um Kim Jong-un
and simply convinced him that we weren't
his Target
when was the last time you worried about
North Korea
because I have to admit I was concerned
during the Trump Administration the
first part I was concerned it looked
like maybe there was some real trouble
there but I would say
I haven't thought about it a long time
in my opinion Trump removed that threat
now you know they're building up their
their missiles and stuff and that's not
good but that wasn't going to stop was
it
I I don't see anything that the United
States or anybody else could have done
to stop North Korea
so so Trump did the only thing that made
sense
he made ourselves less of a Target
that was the only thing that ever made
sense that he did it
so
um
I I hate seeing Abe's book being taken
seriously on that point
I had to tweet today because I realized
that a lot of people were accusing me
and maybe maybe you too you may have
been accused of this too
a lot of people said that
my decisions during the pandemic were
because I was afraid of dying
are any of you afraid of dying
because I've never been afraid of dying
I don't even understand it
I mean I'll I'll avoid it I'll do what I
have to do to avoid but why would you be
afraid of something that removes all
your pain
I don't even understand the concept
no you're talking about the process of
dying
let's agree that nobody wants nobody's
looking forward to the actual moment of
death I'm not talking about that I'm
talking about just like being dead
are you afraid of being dead
it removes your joy but you won't know
the difference
you might be I would be afraid of
someone else dying that I cared about
because that would affect me
huh well I would like to clarify I
always put maximum attention into not
being hurt or disabled
so being hurt or disabled in this life
I'm definitely going to try to avoid
that as much as possible
but dying I've I don't think I've ever
considered that in any of my decisions
so the most I realize the most um
misleading belief about me
is that I didn't calculate correctly the
the risk of dying from covid versus you
know a shot
I'm not even sure I put that in my
thinking
because I didn't think the risk of dying
from the shot was very big I didn't
think the risk Bang from covid was very
big and I didn't really care about being
dead
like literally it's just not part of my
thinking about anything and not just the
pandemic
not once in my life I actually had to
ask my my ex-wife
my first ex-wife uh I asked her if she
had any memory of me ever being afraid
of dying from anything
and she said no that's never it's never
even been a conversation
no but fear of unpleasantness during
this life yeah absolutely
so that's why I was so focused on Long
covet and from the uh the risk of the
vaccinations the risk is not that they
killed me that they disabled me
so in both cases it's it's the risk of
disabling
from either path
all right so I did a super unscientific
poll I wondered how many of you have
personal experience
with people who had either vax related
injury according to them or long covet
according to them so remember this is
the most unscientific survey it's just
on Twitter just people who follow me
people who decided to answer so there's
nothing scientific about it but it's
still kind of interesting so I asked
first I said how many people do you
personally know right now people you
heard of but people you personally know
who have a doctor diagnosed not just a
suspected but the doctor believes that
they have an injury from getting the
shots the covet shots
so 64 percent of people answered said
they don't know anybody who had even a
suspected vax related injury is it okay
if I call the vax injury for shorthand
if we all agree that they're not really
vaccinations
okay will you allow that just as a
shorthand it's easier than explaining it
every time
[Music]
um but about 13 said they know one
person
13 percent
said they know somebody with a vaccine
drink but 23 percent
said they know more than one person
with a doctor diagnosed vax injury that
they know personally
now if you add together the ones who
know one and more than one
so you get uh you have 36 percent
of the people who answered this believe
they know somebody who the doctor has
confirmed at least in the doctor's
opinion is a vax injury
what let me ask this question I know
there are a number of doctors who are
watching this so those of you who are
medical doctors and especially if you're
still
um practicing here's what I'd like to
say I would like to see you answer that
you're a doctor so we know when you
answer you know I'm a doctor
just say doctor and then say wouldn't we
notice that all the hospitals were
overflowing if anything like this were
true would the hospitals not be
overflowing
let's see doctors only
doctors weigh-in
I might be wrong about that
no I didn't say how I did not say
hospitalized but that would be the
effect of it
injury is vague
uh I'm a doctor that seems very unlikely
yeah
uh hospitals are overflowing somebody
says I don't think they are
uh
uh
most myocarditis doesn't get admitted
but even if most didn't get admitted it
would still be
a jam in the hospitals right so here's
one of these things where it's sort of
the math
intuition
if you work with numbers a lot you get
sort of an intuition about what's
possible and what isn't and you know
it's not it's not really a science but
my intuition says this couldn't possibly
be true it couldn't possibly be true
that 36 percent of people
personally know somebody who had a vax
injury
that's you know well established
do you think we would still be giving
shots if this were true
I think we would stop if a fraction of
this were true
but I might be wrong all right so I
asked the same question about uh long
covet
how many people do you personally know
who have doctor diagnosed not not just
they suspected but doctor diagnosed long
covet so 84 said none but uh
almost nine percent said one
and over seven percent said more than
one
so you got 16 percent ish 16 of people
who think they know somebody who had
long covet
doctor diagnosed long covered do you
believe that
because a lot of you believe that long
cover doesn't exist
but 16 of my audience and my audience is
mostly people who believe it doesn't
exist and even among the group of people
who are biased or thinking it doesn't
exist
still 16 think they know somebody who
was diagnosed by a doctor
yeah I'm not going to defend the the
scientific validity of it don't get me
wrong
yeah
does that is any of that interesting
are you I I find these I find this
interesting even though it's you know
scientifically invalid it does give you
a sense of where the public is or at
least the public that's following me
that's interesting you know it's not
science it's just telling me where where
your minds are at
all right are you aware that there was a
massive mask study a study of studies a
big meta study of studies and they
decided that uh masks might work a
little bit but not enough to have been
worth it
are you aware of that it's pretty big
news Time Magazine had a big write-up
and uh Zero Hedge has one that's on
Twitter today
now
I saw Brett Weinstein say that uh
I think he might have been wrong at one
point but then He adjusted it to right
and uh
now now some people you say you told me
so but you know this is my opinion right
how many of you
are aware that this was my exact opinion
from the beginning
that was my exact opinion so these
studies are confirming my exact opinion
on masks you know that right
do you hate that
do you hate that this big new study
agrees with me exactly
so the ones that say no it didn't you're
reading the headline not the study if
you read the study
it says that the actual benefit might be
in the nine percent range at most
but that overall people are sloppy with
their mask wearing and it didn't make it
didn't make any difference in the big
numbers
and therefore my opinion was
from an engineering and physics
perspective it had to make some
difference
but not enough that you could see so
therefore it was not justified and
that's that's what the big study says
you had to make some difference it looks
like it did
tiny bit but not nearly enough to
compensate for all the the negatives of
it
completely right Not only was I
completely right on that from the
beginning
but I'm the only person in the country
who spotted fauci's lie
when he said that bass totally don't
work but I knew he didn't believe it now
that's separate from the question of
whether they work the only question is
whether he believed he was lying and he
did and I spotted that he believed he
was lying I knew it immediately I called
it out
so I'm also the first person in the
country to blame fauci for lying to the
public about the pandemic I'm the first
one
how did you know because it's obvious
it's obvious
it's the same reason I knew that they
had to help a little
all right let me let me tell you where I
think they would help
that you need a specific example
here's where they don't help
here's where we all agree
you sit in a room with with somebody
with bad ventilation
and you both have masks on and you stay
there for two hours
do I think that the mask helps you if
you're in a poorly ventilated close area
no no because over time there's enough
virus that comes out the sides in the
top right so that would be obviously
doesn't help and I've always been on
that page
because it's very obvious that you know
if you don't have a good fitting Mass
there's air coming out everywhere now
let me give you the most specific
rare situation
that in my opinion and according to the
studies I would say the studies back me
up there's the rarest opinion when it
might make a little bit of difference
right outside of this rare rare opinion
I don't think any difference all right
here's the rare rare situation
um you have coveted
you don't know it but you haven't
you want to say a quick hello to Grandma
in the rest home
and grandma doesn't hear so well so you
end up getting a little too close
but you're only going to be there for a
minute
you're literally going to be there one
minute but you want to say happy
birthday to Grandma so you go in the
room you get you're kind of close
Grandma happy birthday I'm always taking
a second gotta go all right goodbye have
a good birthday
in that one situation
you wouldn't be allowing so much into
the room through the sides of your mask
that is likely to make a difference
because it's only one minute and let's
say it's well ventilated but if you had
covet and you were shouting into
Grandma's open mouth
for one minute could you give her covet
shouting into her mouth your actual
covet from you'll say two feet away
I would say yes
somebody says no
come on you're not being honest
be honest
be honest in that weird little one
situation that almost never happens
the front of the Mask would cause the
coveted plume to go sideways and out
where a well ventilated room could
handle some of it but if you shouted it
directly into Grandma's open mouth
there's more chance you would get
covered
now I want to see somebody argue that
because if you do
you're not being honest
go ahead all right argue with that case
if you're saying it's an outlier you're
agreeing with me
right
I'm saying that it has to be true from a
physics and Engineering perspective
from a physics and Engineering
perspective
barriers work
they just don't work well
but they make some difference
if you don't think if you think you can
blow out a candle with a mask on
then I would say that my situation would
be the same as every other situation
yeah
all right so
um I'm the rightest person in the
country on masks
um and the rightest person in the
country on vaccine decisions because I'm
the only one who considered long covet
and the people who believe that 100 of
what the government approves uh are bad
are not really serious
conversationalists on this if you
believe that just because the government
acted sketchy about the vaccines there
wasn't any chance they could help
right if you really discounted their
benefit down to zero you're not a
serious person you're just not serious
all right
uh what is long covered well we don't
know but 16 of the people who from this
very audience 16 of this audience
believes they know somebody who has it
that's a lot
that's a lot now they could be wrong
right I'll agree with you that we still
have the possibility that long covet
doesn't exist at all would you agree
with that
uh yeah
all right
so it feels good to be right about
everything and to be finally approved
right in the long run
um I thought it was hilarious uh that
a lot of you knew I was pranking when I
apologized for being wrong about
everything
you knew that was a prank right
I just wanted to see how much energy I
could attract my way before I declared
victory
foreign
what else we got going on here
let me check the news on CNN and tell
you what's happening
so do you believe that Ukraine shot down
61 Russian cruise missiles
let's see in the comments
now we've been sending him you know
technology that should be shooting down
cruise missiles isn't 61 a lot of
missiles
how many cruise missiles do you think
Russia has
because they're kind of expensive aren't
they
yeah I didn't you know
you think they have a million cruise
missiles
no
I'll bet their cruise missiles are more
like a thousand
what would you guess
uh probably under a thousand right
if they shot 61 down
I don't know what time frame that was
but
it's a lot of shooting down I know I
don't I don't believe it
they make more than the use
um and then there's nothing here about a
major offensive coming
but I wouldn't be surprised
so
um the thing that I
get the most pushback from is that
because it's my way to show both sides
of most topics if you just dip it and
only see me talking about one side
you think I'm on that side now I also
realized that I talk way more about
Ukrainian victories than uh the
potential for Russia to you know win in
the end
but the reason I do that is that the
potential for Russia to win in the end
that's kind of obvious isn't it
how much do I need to talk about the
obvious it's the non-obvious that I talk
about
so that's why you see me talk about oh
Ukraine got this right or Ukraine did
this or Ukraine had a surprising Victory
that's because they're the non-obvious
things
the the number of people who who think
they need to rush us plain to me
Scott let me let me explain to you
if Russia really wants to win they can
just keep pressing until they do I know
that
I get that
yeah that's totally obvious
so I don't say the obvious as much as I
should but let me say it now so you've
heard it once
if it's true that Russia is mounting a
major campaign
it might work
my
I wouldn't rule it out so I so if you
think that I think Ukraine is just going
to you know march to Victory and take
back all their land and all that stuff I
don't think that
my best guess is something like a a
really painful stalemate
that finally creates a situation where
uh part of Ukraine ends up in Russian
hands and everybody's unhappy but
they're not at War
that's probably what's going to happen
and it might take until
it's possible that Russia will stall
until Trump is elected
actually I'm going to make that my
prediction
I think I'll make that my prediction
I'm going to predict that Putin is going
to just stay alive
and keep pressure on until uh Trump gets
elected
because he could deal with Trump but he
knows he can't get a deal
that he would be happy with uh with a
Democrat
so
that's a bold prediction I'm making it's
a bold prediction
so that's my prediction there will be no
negotiated end of the war under Biden
all right everybody hear that
so my prediction is that Biden will
never negotiate the end of it because
Putin will wait for Trump
because if you were if you were a
foreign Observer wouldn't you think
Trump is going to win
would you let me ask that I'll put that
as a question not a statement if you are
a foreign Observer if you were Putin and
you were keeping an eye on our country
and you were looking at the polls
wouldn't you think Trump is coming back
if you didn't you would only believe it
because of dirty tricks
which wouldn't be a bad prediction that
dirty tricks will keep Trump out of
office
they work once
yeah I'm going to say no no negotiated
under the war while Biden's in office
that's my prediction
because I think Putin's best play is to
wait for Trump
and then if it's not Trump
yet at least it's not Biden because
don't you think that Putin also suspects
Biden of some Ukrainian
money laundering
wouldn't you love to know what Putin
knows about the bidens in Ukraine
because you know Putin's got some
information about the bidens in Ukraine
and you know what's interesting
he's never dropped that information
isn't that interesting that's sort of a
dog that's not barking isn't it
now it could be that that would open up
some other can of worms so he can't do
it I mean that might be a good reason
for it but
kind of interesting that Putin would not
be
accusing the bidens of having a
Ukrainian nasty connection
why would he not do that that's such an
obvious thing to do
isn't it
it's the most obvious thing to do just
to say Biden's corrupt so that's why
he's supporting Ukraine so you Americans
should stop supporting your crowd
president
no one would believe it oh I don't know
I don't know somebody believes
everything
there's almost nothing that's do you
remember when the news reported that
Russia blew up its own pipeline to
Germany
do you remember how many people I argued
with who said Scott Scott
of course they blew up their own
pipeline that's how they are they're
just like that and I said
um
that's like ridiculous
now I'm sure we still don't know what
happened but it's still ridiculous to
think that Russia blew up their own
pipeline that's pretty ridiculous
but people believed it
you saw people believe it right I'm not
making it up you saw a lot of people
believed it and that was absurd
so you're telling me that people
wouldn't believe Putin if he said he had
some dirt on my yeah some would about I
don't know what percentage but probably
25 percent
all right the story about uh SpaceX I'm
looking at CNN's page SpaceX admits
blocking Ukrainian troops from using
satellite technology
I don't know I'm not even interested in
that story I feel like it's going to be
some
just fake news
do you ever read some headlines and that
you don't read the story because you're
like ah that looks like fake news
this one just looks like fake news I
mean there might be like an element of
truth to it but somehow I feel like the
context is fake without even reading it
I just feel like that one's going to be
fake I don't need to read it
um
also on CNN Russia the cup oil output by
five percent as sanctions might I wonder
if five percent makes any difference to
them
I don't feel like five percent is going
to make them quit the war
what what kind of uh reduction in
Russian energy output
would signal that they're they're done
for
probably 40 percent
would you say
like just off the top of my head if it
went down 40 percent they'd have trouble
paying their bills
because it's pretty profitable like five
percent isn't going to move the deal
yeah maybe 25 to 40 somewhere in there
everything would fall apart
so we're not really close to anything
like that yet
all right let's see what else is
happening
um
blah blah blah Meta Meta is going to put
uh Trump back on Facebook and Instagram
I don't know if he'll go there I guess
he will probably will
um
and then the Super Bowl is coming
so are you as excited as I am about the
Super Bowl
I am so excited about the Super Bowl
because the teams that are playing are
the uh
the uh
who Eagles Eagles I'm so excited to see
the Eagles play the uh
the Eagles would be playing the
Chiefs the Chiefs so I can't wait to see
the Eagles and Chiefs if there are any
teams that I love more than them I can't
even think of what I can't even think I
want Eagles and Chiefs nothing excites
me like that
also there will be a puppy Bowl
Florida house gives DeSantis new power
over Disney
that's funny
somebody says Medicare and Social
Security insolvency is right around the
corner
oh Ted Cruz introduced the term limit
bill
that's free money
all right so good for Ted Cruz so the
free money is that citizens love they
just love term limit bills but it has no
chance of getting passed so he doesn't
have to worry about his own term limit
that's free money
free money he makes everybody happy
because he introduced the bill and he'll
probably argue for it effectively but it
won't pass
because Congress wants their jobs so he
gets all the benefit of having pushed
the thing that people want and he gets
to keep his job
that's a pretty good deal that's free
money right it makes everybody else look
stupid for not doing it
doesn't it
I feel like all the people doing this
smart stuff is the same six people
am I wrong about that there's like six
people who are just consistently doing
all the smart people all the smart stuff
like Matt Gates is one sees the free
money picks it up picks it up about Matt
Gates I realized I didn't
quite summarize it the way I wanted to
Matt Gates recognized a situation where
he can win
but he can't lose
so he's the most outspoken one I think
on defunding the Ukraine war
now what happens if the war goes well
and uh I don't even know what well looks
like but whatever you think is well and
you know Putin backs down and whatever
are people going to remember
that Matt Gates said don't do that
because you'll never know what it would
have looked like if you had stopped the
funding right there will never be a
comparison because you only do one thing
so you'll know how it worked out with
the thing you did but you'll never know
if the other thing would have been
better
so let's say the war rages on for
several years but then you know we think
we won whatever that is well we still
spent like hundreds of billions of
dollars tons of people died
you know Russia would be our enemy for
life
what does winning look like
so even if we quote one in several years
nobody's going to think Matt Gates was
wrong
because they won't know what the other
thing look like but suppose
but suppose we you know defund and
it goes well then he gets credit
so I think he has lots of ways to win
and I guess the other possibility is he
wins
and so I think where he's safe is that
they're not going to adopt his idea
so he's safe because we'll never know if
it was a good idea but what if he won
and people said all right you're right
let's defund Ukraine and then Ukraine
got taken over by Russia and it was like
tragic over there
what would Americans say
can't tell the difference
can't tell the difference
in fact probably fewer ukrainians would
die
per day
if Russia just rolled in and took over
now I don't want that to happen I want
the ukrainians to have control over
their own faith but the fact is it
probably wouldn't affect us at all
probably not and I don't believe that it
would be you know the Domino that
Putin's going to use to conquer Europe
because I don't think that was ever real
I think it really was about Ukraine
that's what I think and I I think that
how Russia feels about Ukraine is not
the way they feel about Poland
it just doesn't it's just not the same
so anyway
um Matt Gates is playing the smart
political card I don't know if it I'm
not smart enough to know what is the
right geopolitical thing to do but
politically he's the only one who's
playing his farm
all right and I guess we know that that
balloon had lots of sensors and antennas
for reading stuff
so no surprise huh all right is there
any uh story I've missed that is uh
important to you
how do you balance term limits and
institutional knowledge well usually
staffs
and the permanent employees
have all the institutional knowledge
so I'm not sure there's a benefit to all
the institutional knowledge frankly are
you seeing all that institutional
knowledge really helping out in Congress
you know is is Congress using all of its
institutional knowledge and experience
to solve fentanyl now now are they using
all their institutional knowledge to ban
Tick Tock nope all of their
institutional knowledge is correlated
with them being old and out of touch and
they don't even know what their threat
is
don't even know the threat
all right
um
institutional knowledge is the problem
maybe yeah maybe it's what we know not
what we don't know you're right about
that
I didn't cover the uh fumunda cheese
shortage
well I didn't even know about it
Dr Jill and kamalu today
yeah I was saying this earlier on the
locals platform before I signed on to
YouTube but that whole thing about uh
um Dr Jill giving uh the the
kamala's husband a kiss
that wasn't nothing
well why do you think that's a story
what
you know and and we're spending hours
talking about whether the kiss was right
on the lips or was it like a little off
a little off base
by the way how
have you never had the situation where
you went to kiss somebody on the cheek
and you missed and you end up like
awkwardly kissing on the side of the
like
you've never done that oh that's never
happened
well that's happened to me
it's definitely happened to me
perv
never well it's a thing that happens
let's just say something I I'm sorry
that people haven't tried to kiss you
more so you've experienced that
apparently people just love to kiss me
strangers
just anywhere come up in public and try
to kiss me
no it's not that bad but yeah I'm so
kissable it's a problem it's a big
problem
all right anything else going on
I don't think so huh
are we ready to go enjoy our weekend
fetterman how's feder been doing is he
released
I didn't see any fetamine news on CNN so
is he just still being observed
uh it's not looking good
oh you think he got out today
all right uh any thoughts on having the
climate craziness show up in Dilbert
comics
well
um I don't know how to play that exactly
Andrew Tate there's no news on the tapes
except they're still being held actually
that is the news uh can somebody give me
an update on the Tate Brothers have they
not been held longer than
the 30 days
are they still being held but without
charges filed longer than they should
have been held
what do you think talked about project
Veritas yesterday
all right so I guess we don't know
we don't know but I'm going to stick
with my
position that they're innocent until oh
it was a 60-day hold so we would still
be within the 60 days they extended it
okay oh that's right I guess I guess I
can just keep extending it so there was
there was no deadline per se it was
because they could just
uh I'm not going to watch Barnes
he's an idiot
have you ever wondered about the fact
that children get the same dose as a 400
pound adult
with a vaccination
did that ever seem to you like a little
sketchy
you know maybe the size of the dose just
doesn't make any difference in that
domain which is possible but I don't
know anything else where the size of the
dose doesn't matter
but it feels like it there could be some
situation where it doesn't matter like
it could be
but it seems seems unlikely doesn't it
how in the world does a 400 pounder and
a and a 50 pounder
respond the same to the same dose I
can't even imagine it
um
what do you think about conservatives
picking easy fights well that's the
television problem there's nothing
easier to talk about than Dr Jill
kissing cobbler's husband at the State
of the Union
it's just easy to talk about
so we do
yeah let's talk about the uh distraction
stuff all right we keep talking about
how
uh this news is just a distraction from
this other thing
but isn't it just that people have
different interests than different
things and a lot is happening like
everything is a just everything is a
distraction from everything else
I do believe there's some of it is
manufactured as a distraction some of it
but not most of it I think most of it is
just there's a lot of news
all right
still political prisoners in DC
yeah
um at this point don't you think Trump
should offer to free all of the
remaining
January 6 prisoners
just pardon them or whatever it is I
think they should all be pardoned
yeah
and that would be that would be the
right kind to pardon
and by the way I would say the same
thing if it were
Democrats were being held in jail that's
the right kind because there are some
pardons which are divisive
and you wonder why they happened
but there are other pardons where you go
okay that does seem to have a bring the
country
together element to it right if you can
give me some country benefits
even if it seems unfair at a at a low
criminal level I'll take the country
benefits so that's exactly the kind of
Pardon that I think is a good one yeah
and again it doesn't matter if it's
Democrats or Republicans I would say the
same thing
I I also
I'm pretty uh liberal about
ex-presidents being pardoned
I'm big on that same reason it's just
better for the country and then you know
I I don't
I realize this is the most uh unpopular
thing I could ever say but I don't think
Justice should be equal
I don't believe in Equal justice
I believe in mostly equal
yeah I like it is as good as you can do
but I do think there's there are
exceptions
I do think they're exceptions and I do
think
that some of those exceptions might be
for our leaders
because we're better off if we're not
burdening them with legal problems while
they're trying to do the job I mean it's
an ugly situation either way but I do
think there are some cases where the
country is better off with unequal
Justice it's very rare but I think it
could exist
uh
uh O'Bannon was on the top of the New
York Times disinformation list I've seen
some of those disinformation lists and
they're just laughable
like somebody's opinion of what was
disinformation just laughable
how many of you
uh saw bannon's War Room piece about me
where he talked about me recently last
week in Monday I think
uh
I I very much appreciated his
characterization of me
so that I appreciated quite a bit I have
the same opinion of him he's very very
smart very capable
so I guess I guess we respect each other
on level of capability but
um I wish he had asked the question
and and this is why this is why watching
Dr Jordan Peterson interview people is a
different experience than watching other
people interview
Peterson never forgets the important
questions
well he has the thing that actually
makes sense to ask the the question that
I wanted Steve Bannon to ask
is given that even the person you had he
had on to criticize my point of view
that person actually said that I was
looking at long covered
and then he didn't talk about long covet
that should have been like jumping right
out I was expecting Steve Bannon to say
all right you're saying that Adams was
looking at long covet as part of his
decision what is your take on Long covet
but instead he just ignored it like it
wasn't a variable and just went on with
his presentation like like he hadn't
been totally debunked by that one
question
YouTube flagged my climate hoax stream
it's because I used the word hoax right
is that why
I knew that would happen
I'm okay with that by the way I'm okay
with that
I don't mind that at all you know if if
I say something that's uh opposite of
the mainstream
and then social media puts a warning on
it that says you know this is the
accepted View
this is this is against the accepted
view I'm okay with that
it costs me money right because it gets
demonetized but I'm okay with that
that's a conscious decision
you know when I'm when I'm consciously
disagreeing with the
the authorities I don't mind that you
know that because I say it in my video
itself right even I say this is contrary
to the you know accepted beliefs
so a war I I've never opposed
information
right censoring I I oppose
but putting information about something
that adds to the information that's okay
no problem
uh Russia is reducing their oil output
but they're going to raise prices
could be could be I wouldn't rule that
out
when people can't taste for six months
they have long coveted by definition it
just wouldn't be a long cover that would
be much of a problem I mean I I lost my
sense of spell a long time ago honestly
it's no problem at all
it's the smallest problem in the world
all right
um
we're going to be finishing up
wait Scott you missed a variable okay
this is interesting let's look at this
you missed a variable in your analysis
warm covid was always mitigated by the
possibility of asymptomatic infections
long jab was only mitigated by not
taking the Jab
okay I'm not understanding this long
covid was always mitigated by the
possibility of asymptomatic infection
all right I don't understand that point
I think there's a point there so I'm not
disagreeing I'm not seeing it I don't
know what that point is
how do you calculate the risk of
unicorns exactly
but I but we don't know that it's a
unicorn
how did you know it was a unicorn it
would be the bigger question
you understand it
long covet is just covered Intrigue yeah
of course that's what it is
all right

um
how do you calculate the risk of Health
that's a good question the the risk of
infinite pain well given that we know
the history of how hell was uh it's not
even in the Bible if hell were in the
Bible then there would be a strong
argument well God said so
but given that it's not in the Bible
I don't think I'm worrying about a hell
too much
all right that's all for now YouTube I'm
going to say bye to you I'm going to
talk to the uh locals people for a bit
I'll be
back to you tomorrow best live stream
you've ever seen
bye for now
