for coffee with scott adams is it the
best time of the day
yes it is yes it is it's the best time
of the day
and if you'd like to take it up another
notch and i think you would
what do you need that's right that's
right you need a cup or a mug or a glass
of tanker gels or steiner canteen
drinkers glass
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope being here the day
the thing that makes really everything
better it's called
the simultaneous sip and it's gonna
happen
right now go
well shall we talk about
all of the things yes let's talk about
all the things
so there's a story uh about the money
manager for bill gates
apparently there's one firm and one
individual
who's been managing bill gates money for
27 years or something and now
coincidentally just when
bill gates and melinda gates are having
a divorce
coincidentally after 27 years
bill gates's money manager is in the
news for
of course allegations of
me too stuff and other i think some
other stuff
or being a bully or something uh
allegedly made a
racist remark to a black employee we'd
like to hear that remark
so that we could judge for ourselves but
this story is in the new york times
let me ask you do you think it's a
coincidence
it's just a coincidence that bill gates
is getting all these
bad stories that have been available to
be a story
for a long time but now it's a story
do you do you do you see in this example
that your opinions are assigned to you
by the media
if the media had never told you anything
new about bill gates
well your opinion would be whatever it
had been but suddenly
the press has decided that you need to
think
less of bill gates which probably means
that somebody associated with
melinda gates just speculation
may want to make bill gates look a
little bit
less awesome during the period of
negotiating some kind of a divorce
so don't assume that any of this is a
coincidence
here's the good news some real good news
actually
the fda just approved another uh
therapeutic for coronavirus it looks
pretty good
it's a monoclonal antibody
and it's called sotrivamab
it's called sotrivib because all the
good names have been taken
long ago if you need a name for a new
drug now
you have to basically put together all
the letters they shouldn't be in the
same word
there's a lot of letters that just
shouldn't be near each other or in the
same word
so
who ends a word with a b
i guess there are a few words that end
with b but too many of them in my
opinion
so the good news is this apparently it
reduces hospitalization or death in
covet patients if you give them a tube
early
by 85 percent what
that's pretty good if you get it get it
to him early
now think about what's different from
the beginning of the pandemic
the first thing that's different is that
everybody knows what the symptoms are
right i think at the beginning of the
pandemic
if somebody got a you know a claw for
some symptoms
they might have said to themselves
that's probably not the covet
probably just a cold and maybe they
waited too long and maybe they died
but i would think that one of the big
things that's changed
is especially with all the social
distancing if you get anything that
looks like coveted
symptoms especially if you have some
comorbidities to worry about
you probably take it a lot more
seriously now just because we're all
trained
to take it seriously so it seems to me
that people who are at risk have either
already been
vaccinated for the most part or
if they haven't been they at least know
what the symptoms are
and can get their ass to the hospital
pretty quickly
now apparently the monoclonal antibody
is mostly for people who
are most of the results are for people
who are
had a bad case so this doesn't
necessarily hold for all people
just people had a bad case of it and got
in early but still a pretty big deal
pretty big deal because i think people
are getting in earlier that's my guess
chad pergram had an interesting theory
that he wrote for
fox news that the
the filibuster which is really the only
thing that allows the minority party
in the senate to have any power at all
they can just filibuster which is
essentially just
talking forever i'm simplifying but
talking forever so that the bill can't
be voted on
because the minority party doesn't have
enough votes
to stop it in a 50 50 way
but they have enough votes to keep the
um
to keep the uh when he held the
filibuster going
so if he got rid of the filibuster
suddenly the democrats could pass
anything they wanted
because they have the majority and they
wouldn't need to worry about getting
past
the filibuster blockade and
chad pergram notes that even democrats
appreciate that the filibuster has a
purpose
because sometimes they're in the
minority party sometimes they want a
filibuster
but chad's hypothesis
and i think it's it's uh worth
mentioning
is that if the republicans use the
filibuster
to stop the investigation of the
so-called
january 6th protest on the capitol
that that would be an inappropriate use
of a filibuster it would look like
they're just trying to
protect republicans or or just trying to
sweep it under the rug but do you think
that's going to be a problem
it seems to me that every use of the
filibuster looks
illegitimate to the other side seems to
me
and i'm not so sure that anybody cares
about this
january 6 investigation what what do
people think they're going to find
i mean really do you think you're going
to find anything
what are they even looking for are they
looking for
something to tie president trump to
violence
i mean they have his speech it looks
like he did what he did in public
i don't know i don't think there's
anything to find it doesn't look like
there's any there there it's just
a bunch of people did exactly what it
looks like
a bunch of people coordinated and said
hey let's protest this thing
things got out of hand i just don't know
i just don't know that there's anything
to research
so no i disagree with chad pergram's
view that the filibuster could fall
because of that one issue
because i don't think anybody cares
about it really it's just a political
issue
um joel pollock points out
that apparently the biden administration
is going to open up
something like a consulate in jerusalem
which i guess was not the case under the
trump administration
so so now hamas is going to
or the let's say i guess maybe the
palestinians whose consulate
is it it's a little unclear to me i
guess i don't know the details of this
but there's some kind of a consulate
being opened up and
i know that over 100 million dollars was
is going to be sent
to hamas or the palestinians
i'm not sure exactly where the division
is there in this case
but the point is
that there seems to be some kind of
reward for attacking israel
attack israel you get you get yourself a
consulate
and over 100 million dollars
that looks like a victory for the people
who fired rockets and
at israel now what is the thing i say
about the democrats
sets them apart from republicans what do
i
what do i always say and i tell you i'm
going to show you
example after example until you can't
think of it any other way
inducements exactly with the the big
difference between republican policy
and democrat policy pretty much always
not always but yeah it seems like 80 of
the time or more
is democrats ignore
the effect of human motivation
consistently
they act like it doesn't exist so when
they design the system
they just ignore the variable that's
actually the most important one
if you design systems that ignore
consistently
the most important variable which is how
do people act
in certain situations what are you doing
it's not engineering it's not smart it's
not reason
it's not it's nothing it's literally
a nothing you can't even say it's good
or bad it's just
nonsense if you leave out the biggest
variable
it would be like i'm going to i think
i'll calculate the national debt
but i'm only going to add up the numbers
that have a 9
in them why right
ok so
democrats here again are rewarding the
bad guys
um or at least the people firing the
missiles you can decide who's
who's bad and who's good and
it's just so consistent that they make
the same mistake over and over again
anyway speaking of the left uh juan
williams has announced he's leaving
the hit show the five on the fox
now some of you don't watch that show i
know most of you watching this probably
have seen it a bunch of times
and i have a uh i have a contrarian
opinion
about juan williams
the thing that you don't realize when
you watch
fox news and i say this often but
this is another perfect example whatever
you want to criticize
fox news about you can't criticize them
for their
um let's say design and production
the producers of fox news are really
good
and they put together just brilliant
elements to create good programming and
there's a reason
there's a reason they dominate the news
landscape it's not just
because there are a lot of conservatives
it's because they produce
a really good product even if you
disagree with its
you know opinions just the product is
really good
and part of that is knowing what things
to put together and what things not to
put together
and my observation about juan williams
is
he was perfect i mean my god he was
perfect
because if you watched the show you
would see you know for
uh let's say more republican or
right-leaning people
uh you know arguably maybe more
independent
but um juan was the lone left-leaning
person
and he did his job so well
because remember it's an entertainment
product it's newsy
but the five is an entertainment product
that just talks about the news
and from an entertainment perspective
you just couldn't depict a better
a better person and to his
credit and i don't think people
appreciated this he knew
exactly his role he knew exactly what he
was supposed to do
and even when his arguments this is just
my speculation because i can't read his
mind
but i feel as though juan
knew when his arguments were weak but
also knew it was his job to
put them forward and he would just get
just slammed and savaged by the other
members
and he would just come back just as
cheerful the next day and
do it again and i i i i think he needs
like an award or something for this
uh so it'll be tough to replace him
because you need somebody who is
he he he had a really weird
um perfect skill stack for that which is
that he was left-leaning
but he was like a positive upbeat
nice guy so it was just everything it
was just perfect
i don't know how they're going to
replace him um
so let's talk about the wujon lab
everybody wants to talk about that
i have a question
which is how do you calculate the odds
that it's a coincidence that
a virus escapes right across
from where there's a wet lab but also
where there's a
where there's a lab that does that kind
of work
can't you calculate that could somebody
tell me
how many let's say cities there are that
have
well let's say over a million people
in the world and and also cities that
would be
an industrial outlies country that would
have a
you know have a lab what are the odds
and then on top of the odds that a virus
would break out right where there's that
kind of lab
what are the odds that they would locate
the lab right next to a wet market
which is the other way that you might
imagine a
virus could appear and
were you shocked when china decided to
reopen all of its wet markets
after time has gone by and you're
looking back
if you're looking back on it is it kind
of a little convenient
that the lab that works on viruses
is located right next to the alibi
if you're gonna commit a crime or you
think a crime might be committed that
you would be blamed for
wouldn't you want to locate the
possibility of a crime
even before it happened right next to
the alibi
is that a coincidence i feel like that
might be a little bit
strategic otherwise it's the luckiest
thing that ever happened
or it could be that there's a wet market
you know in every big city so
you couldn't stay away from that's
possible but
can it be calculated so this is a
serious question can somebody do me the
calculation
if we have that data how many cities how
many virus labs
how many of them are next to a wet
market
just show us the odds because it could
be that if you calculated the odds
maybe i don't know maybe you'd come up
with 20
chance it could happen maybe
you know i'm not qualified to calculate
that and i don't have the data
but i feel as if it wouldn't be 20
it feels more like it's deeply unlikely
it's a coincidence
but of course coincidences do happen
and it might not be a coincidence there
could be a reason it could be just that
there are lots of lots of wet markets
and lots of labs and maybe it was just
going to happen somewhere
cnn in its reporting about this
said that the lab escape idea originally
was being spread
by conspiracy theorists
what if it's
if it's currently considered by all the
experts in the world
as at least a possibility
was it really conspiracy theorists and
who was it who decided
that the people who had that opinion
early on
who was it who labeled them conspiracy
theorists
wasn't that cnn wasn't it cnn and
and their trained monkeys who
uh or winged monkeys i guess the flying
monkeys
wasn't a cnn and people like them uh
who who labeled people conspiracy
theorists
it's good to be the news you just get to
call anybody that disagrees with you
conspiracy theorists
so senator kennedy was talking to
i guess some kind of congressional
hearing
he was talking with fauci and collins
and
got them to admit that biden never
consulted their top health
health officials before they killed the
probe uh
that the trump administration had
started about finding out where the
covet came from
so biden killed a trump thing without
even talking to any experts
his own experts he didn't even talk to
his own experts
purely purely political but now
biden is forced to restart it and it
makes him look
bad so how many times have i told you
that
you're gonna find time and time again
that trump looked
right now did trump and pompeo
really have secret information way back
when they were saying it was probably
the lab
did they have secret information that we
still don't know
i don't know about that but i'll tell
you one of the things that i think
trump is good at and is totally
underrated
he's good at spotting
i feel like that's one of his highest
skills
and it could have something to do with
the fact that he promotes too
you know takes one to no one kind of a
situation
and so i feel like trump being you know
as his critics would say
the king of i feel like he
knows when he sees it
right and i think he looked at this
wuhan thing and probably said to himself
i know what looks like uh this
looks like to me
so he may have maybe uh could have been
some hyperbole and how certain he was
but i think his instincts can't be
ignored
when it comes to when it comes to spot
and
i feel like he's probably good at it i
feel like he's good at it
all right speaking of covid nearly
three-quarters of patients who had
moderate to severe
case of covet had at least one long-term
symptom and most of it was brain fog
brain fog which is bad stuff
if you know anybody who's had the
problem it's not fun
and it seems to last a while months at
least
and are you scared of anything that
gives you brain fog
because does a cold ever give you a
brain fog
does a does a regular virus give you
brain fog for months
what the hell is happening to your brain
so apparently there was some movement on
vaccine
acceptance when the cdc said if you're
if you're vaccinated you can take off
your masks in certain situations
so apparently that little bit of
human motivation they got right oh
if you tell people there's a reward for
getting a vaccination
maybe they'll do more of it again
something democrats were blind to
the democrats couldn't figure out that
if there were no reward for the
vaccinations
not enough people would get them but
they finally figured it out
and i would say that this brain fog
thing has to go into the mix too
and indeed this was one of the biggest
reasons that i decided to get vaccinated
because i don't know what the risks of
the vaccination are but i got a pretty
good
idea what the risk of not getting
vaccinated is and it looks pretty ugly
all right but you can make your own
decisions i'm sure you will
uh mashable which is a really good
follow on twitter
mashable they have a lot of new
technology stuff you haven't seen yet
they they've got a little uh piece on
there i tweeted today on
drone flying saucers so apparently
there's a
form factor that looks just like a
flying saucer
but it's a you know motorized drone and
one of its advantages
is they can sort of stop quickly and
change directions and
apparently uh they think it could be
juiced up to the point where it would be
um
scott has coronaphobia you get a
remove for that put user in timeout
no mind reading no mind reading please
um so if there's a flying saucer
that we know already exists you know we
can see it there's video of it flying
around and stuff
what do you think of the odds that the
us military has
drones that have the form factor of a
flying saucer
what do you think what are the odds
that some advanced military lab has a
flying saucer shaped
drone given that we know there's a you
know a commercial version
of it already yeah it's like 100
they're at least testing it right they
don't all look like
you know rockets and airplanes so
they're probably at least testing it
now does that explain why it would look
um
why it would look like it's defying
physics
i feel as if the defying physics part is
just not real
even if it turns out that these
spaceships are from another planet
i think we're going to find out that the
defying physics never really happened
in any of the senses i think it's just
how we record it
you know the artifact of how you video
video it etc
i doubt anything is defying physics
but we're now hearing the reports that
there are
uh underwater ufos what
that's right apparently there are lots
and lots of reports
of underwater craft moving again
at speeds which we can't understand
according to our current technology and
physics
and apparently there's a lot of them
including one case where a vessel
emerged and grabbed a
some kind of a sensor that somebody else
was going to pick up and just
grabbed it and then pulled it under
water what
so my prediction had been that if there
are ufos they're more likely coming from
our ocean
than they are coming from another planet
why
because the physics and technology that
you would have to
solve to have a hidden underworld
underwater world seem far easier
than solving the distance problem from
other planets
now i'm open to that being wrong
so if elon musk wants to tell me no no
no
we can solve the you know distance
problem
uh maybe the ocean is actually the
harder place
but i'm going to put that out there for
those who are smarter than i am
which would be a harder problem to solve
technology living under the ocean with
all the water pressure and
problems that go with it or
traveling from a distant planet so far
away we can't even detect
life on it from here which is which is
easier
i'm guessing the water is easier
i'm also guessing that um it could be
the aliens have been on earth for
a million years but they prefer living
in the water
and they just live there it could be
that alien probes
let's say robots for a better word have
been living in our ocean for a million
years
and they just pop out every now and then
to look around see what's what's new
nigel goodbye nigel
i wonder if at home you're an or
just in public
i tell you my life has gotten so much
better now that i learned to understand
which comments
are coming from narcissists the
narcissists are the one whose comments
are designed to make them look smarter
than whoever they're commenting about
and so usually they're not attacking you
know just the evidence or the
or the the argument which would also
make you look smarter
but they're usually just like general
put downs my god this guy's never
studied virology what does he know about
physics yeah the peacocks
so as i was writing on uh on the locals
platform this morning
i was saying that i have a persuasion
technique i've been uh
trotting out in which i call these
people peacocks
so for example today somebody uh
somebody responded to my tweets about
the horned
protester who you know the january 6th
guy with the viking horns
and i made some joke on twitter and
there's always this guy
who comes in my god don't you know that
people
died during that there is nothing funny
about that
now that comment is not meant to make
the world a better place it's not meant
to clarify an argument
nothing it is purely a statement that
they are better than me
that's it i'm better than you because i
don't make jokes about things where
people got killed
so i'm better than you you should be as
good as me
try to be as good as me and so i just
write back
uh i see you peacock now move along
now so far any time i've called somebody
a peacock
and then just dismissed them it kind of
ended the conversation
because what can they do if they go away
well then i win because i said go away
peacock and they went away
but if they stay they're going to be
peacocking
and they don't want to they don't want
to play into my insult
so they can't stay and be a peacock and
they can't leave
but they end up just sort of leaving
so try that out try calling somebody a
peacock see how far they
see along they stick around so if i told
you that there are some things which the
government should lead and then there
are some things which the government
just can't do
and and the public has to lead the
government
now this is certainly the case with face
masks and distancing
i believe the public is leading the
government and the government's trying
to catch up
that's my my view of it but there's
another
case of this happening now with fentanyl
so as you know china is shipping
fentanyl into the cartels the cartels
are shipping into the united states
and killing tens of thousands of people
every year with overdoses
now you could argue no no those people
are killing themselves
nobody made them make take fentanyl
and i hear that argument however if we
didn't have fentanyl
they would be taking other drugs far
less dangerous
they wouldn't be off drugs but they
would be at least taking drugs that are
far less likely to kill them so
because our government for whatever
reason both under
trump and biden have been completely
incapable of stopping this whatsoever
apparently citizens are starting to
organize to do it themselves
and one mother uh jackie berlin
whose son is apparently at risk of dying
from fentanyl because
he's hooked and she knows that his odds
of
surviving are about the same as my
stepson who
died from fentanyl and other drugs
and so she's taking her protests she
she took her protest to san francisco
was joined by
michael schellenberger and about 30
other people
and they went right to the open air
drug market and protest gossip press
and they're moving their protest to skid
row in los angeles
now of course i i'm fully in favor of
this
i wish i could be there myself
yeah just not practical in my case but
if i could i would
and this is another case in which the
government has just failed us
just completely failed us because we
shouldn't do anything with china until
they stop
the fentanyl trade that should be the
ticket to even having a conversation
we should close our embassies we just
say you china
look you know it's bad enough you got
the uyghur situation it's bad enough
you're stealing your ip it's bad enough
all the other stuff
but we're not even going to talk to you
until you stop
sending fentanyl because you could just
turn that off
you could just turn it off you're doing
it intentionally
we're not even going to talk to you
until you stop that that should have
been the price of admission
there shouldn't even be a conversation
with china anymore
about this now here's what i need to do
for you
you i need you to do for me i'm trying
to figure out what
law it is or what is stopping
the big companies and let's just say
amazon from
saying what country the manufacturing is
happening in
all right i'm done not knowing that
i need to know where your is built
if you can't tell me i'm gonna start
looking for a company that can
so if somebody wants to launch a
competitor to amazon.com
that tells me where my products are made
so i can stop giving money to china
wherever it's possible
i will immediately take my business
there now
why is it that this is not already
happening i need
somebody who's who can figure this out
to dig down and find the weak underbelly
of this
problem if you can find me the weak
underbelly
i will put an arrow in it i just don't
know where to aim
so i need some aiming help you know a
little little gps guidance here
tell me who to shoot hypothetically not
not actually shooting but tell me where
the target is
just tell me where it is is it amazon is
it jeff bezos
is there a law that's preventing it is
there some kind of
force that's stopping us from knowing
this information
why don't we have a law that requires it
why are republicans sitting on their
thumbs
doing nothing about this the
government has failed us on fentanyl now
it's up to us
so let's solve it the way we know how to
solve it
let's figure out how to know what's
coming out of china
so we can stop buying it you find me the
soft underbelly
i don't know where it is find me the
politician who's stopping it
find me the corporation that's stopping
it
find me whatever is stopping it from
happening and i will
 end them all right
one way or another i mean legally i'm
not going to do anything illegal
but find me the lever i just don't know
where it is i'll pull it you don't have
to do that part
if there's some risk involved let me
take that i'll take on the risk
i just need to know where the target is
because our government has completely
and fully failed us
i would call on um the few capable
people in congress
rand paul tom cotton
all right i'm gonna i might uh fool you
a little bit here and throw this one in
here
elizabeth warren i'm gonna throw
elizabeth warren in the mix
she's effective all right even if you
don't like her politics
somebody needs to get on this
and if you do i will back you for
president
um i think banks are defunct speaking of
elizabeth warren she went hard at jamie
dimon
at a senate hearing about their
overdraft
fees i guess um
jamie dimon's bank which is uh
what is it chase something chase jp
morgan chase
had 1.5 billion in overdraft fees
do you know why banks charge overdraft
fees
because they can and they hate
you
do you know how hard it would be for a
bank to insert a little code into their
into their process and so that you never
have an overdraft
it just comes out of say your credit
card or
comes out of one of your other accounts
do you know how easy it would be
for them to completely make the problem
of overdrafts go away
real easy real easy do you know why they
don't do it
because screwing their customers is very
profitable
and nobody's pushed back hard enough to
make it stop
here's how we should stop banks are
defunct
there's no reason for a bank
it should be an app you could make the
entire banking system go away
with an app it could do everything a
bank could do
it could be gathering money from people
it could be turning it into a crypto
it could be doing you know exchanges it
could have
your savings your checking it could be
your credit card
it could do it all one app
you don't need a bank and of course the
reason banks can exist
is because they have enough money to
control congress so they can get laws
they give them monopolies but if you
could find a way
to you know do a greenfield you know
island
build a banking app you probably could
eventually take out the banks entirely
and i think it's inevitable actually all
right
i have to run and go do some other
things
really soon yes d5 exactly
and i don't know if it's going to be
crypto it could be
that crypto is the way to make banks go
away
because i think you would be able to
create a parallel bank
that's nothing but crypto including
loans
deposits um credit
pretty much everything yeah somebody's
saying it will be crept too i think
you're right
i think because the uh there's so much
uh
regulation in the regular world of money
i don't think you get past that but with
crypto you might do
you might be able to do an end run yeah
and just
eliminate banks except for safe deposit
boxes somebody says yeah okay
i'll let the banks do the safe deposit
boxes they'll basically be a storage
facility
john says banking in africa is via cell
phone provider
well that makes perfect sense right
if you were in africa and the total
amount of money that maybe you were
borrowing or you had your bank
could be maybe a few hundred dollars
why can't the cell phone company just
handle that because
the cell phone company is the the best
guarantee that you'll pay them back
think about this if you knew that you
couldn't get
cell phone service unless you repaid the
loan to your cell phone
carrier who is acting like a bank
you probably pay back the loan would you
or you try as hard as you could
because you don't want to lose phone
service it would be it would be uh
devastating
and if the phone carriers you know
colluded so that you couldn't just go to
another carrier
you'd have to pay back your loan or else
you're never going to get
phone service so banks are actually not
even a good place for banking
the phone company is a really good place
for banking
all right
i'm just looking at your comments for a
moment
we need more strategies to push back
against peacocks
no you really don't because the peacock
label
just try it try it yourself and see what
happens
but only try it on the people who are
just making a statement about you
or your credentials or something don't
don't do it if somebody actually has an
argument
if they have an argument deal with the
argument but if they're not acting like
a
like a respectable player well just peek
out come away they'll go away
um scott did your stepson have
underlying trauma
um nothing that would be beyond what a
well actually depends what you call
trauma
i suppose everybody has so
uh is my super smart liberal friend
happy with biden
i gotta tell you i decided never to talk
to him again
you know um after suffering four years
of insults
from somebody who used to be one of my
best friends because of
talking about trump and he became
just the worst jerk in the world
i mean he just he devolved into just a
monster really
and when it was all over you wrote
me a nice letter and said gosh i hope i
hope we can be friends again
because you know now that trump is gone
what do you think i said
you four years of torturing my ass over
trump
you think i'm just gonna forget that and
just go back to being your
friend
not a chance i will never speak to him
again
he's dead to me and he's a
all right he just has to live with that
so that that's for him to live with
not my problem
um well thank you that was a nice
compliment
all right um no it isn't sad it really
isn't sad at all
see the moment you imagine that it's sad
to lose somebody like that from your
life
you're making a strategy mistake people
like that
shouldn't be in your life get rid of
them
once you learn to be brutal about
getting rid of people who are not
good for you yeah i wouldn't call them
toxic
exactly but it was toxic in that
situation
you got to get rid of people from your
life who are doing that to you
you just got to get rid of them there's
no way to make that better
and i do wonder if he's delighted with
biden's performance
especially especially the more times
that trump is proven right
who knows
i thought i saw a question go by there
that i want to see
uh scott which vaccine did you get and
why well i didn't have a choice
uh i used my health care provider and
they had
one choice for me when i signed up so i
i have the moderna
vaccination but i don't see that it
makes much difference
all right um
i guess that's all i have for now i've
got to go do some other things and i
will talk to you
later
