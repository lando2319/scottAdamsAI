hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time
for coffee with scott adams if you think
that's a tribble
on my shirt it's not it's a microphone
and the trouble with tribbles is well
you know you've seen the show
but what do you need to have the best
day
of the entire day it's called the
simultaneous tip
and without it you might feel a little
bit empty but luckily i'm here to help
and all you need is a copper mug or
glass a tanker chelsea
stein a canteen truck or flask of vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
coffee join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine in the day the
thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous zip
it happens now go
oh well
so i've been very curious since the
beginning of the pandemic
about how the people who turned out to
be wrong
would manage their public reputations
and what i mean by wrong is that in the
beginning some people were saying it was
the end of the world
or you know it was a big not the end of
the world but
it would be a major major pandemic and
other people said
it's just basically a cold forget it
now one of those two sides was going to
be right in the end
because that you know probably there's
nothing in the middle ground there that
people would say well it was or it
wasn't i feel like it's either going to
be the pandemic
or it was no big deal now wouldn't you
say that we can say at this point
are you not on board with the fact that
it's a big deal
400 000 people dead in this country
millions dying around the world
i feel as though the people who said it
wasn't a big deal
have been disproved
a lot of you still are not on board
you know it's actually amazing to see
this
because i i spend time in uh in the
conservative bubble
as well as the liberal bubble i try to i
try to
spend time in both bubbles uh
i i'm amazed that so many of my audience
who is watching right now and watching
the comments go by there's a
strong bias toward thinking that the
pandemic is fake
let me tell you something with complete
confidence
the pandemic it's real
it's real something like half of the
people getting the virus are having
ongoing complications does that sound
like no big deal to you
half of them i don't know if that number
is right
but somebody says the the numbers aren't
real so it's just
it's basically the election thing just
applied to
the pandemic let me finish my point
let's say hypothetically since most of
you do not accept
what i consider obvious at this point
that the pandemics are real pandemic
i consider that beyond obvious at this
point
now if you're still on the side this
says it's a fake pandemic the numbers
are fudged
there's no real problem out there i feel
as though your day will come
when you might move over to my side if
you're not there yet
i'll give you some time we should have
probably half a million deaths
pretty soon that might get your
attention by june maybe a million
i don't know how big is the number going
to get but
at some point you'll agree with me and
here's my point
what were the people who were wrong and
i guess we don't know that yet
according to you uh what would people
are wrong say
when they're wrong i was watching alex
berenson who's
probably famous as the the most
skeptical of the
tight lockdown restrictions and i was
listening to him on fox news yesterday
and he did a little verbal sleight of
hand
that i'd like you to look for now
i don't personally know if the science
of masks is perfectly accurate or not
i don't know i don't personally know
what kind of lockdowns and restrictions
work and which ones don't
but there are people who have strong
opinions on it i don't feel that the
information is quite out there to have a
strong opinion
but uh so alex berenson i believe he
went from saying that masks
don't work can somebody fact check me on
this
i feel he had been saying masks don't
work to
change the pandemic curve but his latest
statement i heard was that masks don't
protect the wearer
but that's actually what the scientists
say so has he
give me a fact check on this has he
shifted back
while trying to act like he hasn't to
completely agree with the science from
being a skeptic
because science always said the mask
isn't going to help
the wearer so much but it might reduce
the
the risk to other people and i feel that
that's what alex
is saying now that it doesn't help the
wearer but i feel like he's saying it
like you're supposed to hear it like it
doesn't help anybody
does it feel to you that he shifted so
i'll put that as a question
not not a allegation just the question
whether he's
shifted and whether you whether you're
detecting that or not
um here's a comment people made when i
was asking the question
is there any physical possible way
to massively let's say widespread cheat
on a major election
and get away with it and have it not
detected by either
an audit or a recount and some people
weighed in
and said well there is one way which is
you throw away the ballots
before they ever reach the counting
station
so let's say and i'm not saying this
happened by the way so i'm not
alleging this happened i'm just pointing
out that there is a way
to do widespread fraud without it being
detectable by a recount
or by an audit and that would be and
again
no allegation that this happened i have
no information
that what i'm going to say next happened
i don't even suspect it
it's just if you want to know the
complete story
if the folks in the in the post office
decided to just throw away the ballots
for certain zip codes that they knew
were going to be
trump voters that's it
that's all it would take it would just
take the postal employees to take all
the ballots and just
throw them away now when you did the
recount there would be nothing to count
because those ballots never reached the
counting center
how would the how would the person whose
vote was thrown away know if they voted
probably wouldn't and if they checked
they might find out oh
i guess mine got lost in the mail right
so if you thought that there was no way
for it to happen
that is a way but let me add that it
would require lots and lots of people
being in on it
and therefore the odds of being caught
just because you'd have a whistleblower
is really high so i don't think it could
be that widespread
maybe it didn't need to be if it was
concentrated in the the swing cities
or swing zip codes but if it was even
that widespread i think we'd get a
whistleblower
there would be a little information on
that so i don't think it happened
but i just put that out there for
complete completeness
i saw um some tweets people talking
about
there's a stanford study that says
there's no clear
significant benefit of the more
restrictive shutdowns
now what does a more restrictive
shutdown mean
uh i guess you could use your
imagination there
but do you think that this is a
reasonable study without even looking
at it without looking at the study
without knowing who did it
without knowing that is peer reviewed
because it is peer-reviewed
does this sound real like a useful study
to you
and if not what's wrong with it just on
the surface
anything wrong with it well let me tell
you what's wrong with it
i imagine that they looked at places
that had restrictive
rules and places with a little less
restrictive although everything is
restricting at some point
right every i think everybody's doing a
little something and so they probably
looked at them and said hey there's not
much difference
the super restrictive people had bad
infections the less restrictive people
had bad infections or at least similar
you're done right if the people who
did the restrictive stuff did not get
better outcomes than the people who did
restrictive stuff
that's all you need to know isn't it
peer-reviewed
we're good now right if you think that
you need to learn a little bit more
about the world and how to compare stuff
here's what's wrong with it in my view
just on the surface without even looking
into it at all
which places had the most restrictive
lockdowns was it the places that didn't
have many infections
no the places with the most infections
and the most reason to think that there
would be more
let's say they have lots of travel it's
a population center they they know it's
a problem area
do you think that the problem areas
would do more restrictive lockdowns
than the non-problem areas i think so
that would be the whole point right you
do more restrictive lockdowns where you
think there's going to be more problem
now let's say that the restrictive
lockdowns and the non-restrictive
lockdowns
end up generating something similar in
terms of outcomes
what have you learned nothing
nothing because you don't know what
would have happened in the bad
infection area if they had not done the
lockdown
there's nothing to compare it to if
you're comparing it to a different
situation
a different place with a different you
know different infection rate
that's the wrong comparison now did this
study do that
or did the study do a controlled study
where they did the same city with a lock
with restrictions
and the same virus and then no of course
they didn't there's no way to test that
you couldn't do any kind of a controlled
study the only thing you know is what
happened
that's it all you know is what happened
you actually don't know why there are
too many variables
is it the sun is it the pattern of
people
is it the demographic the age is there
something about the culture
that you know they're more likely to get
together
there are a lot of young people in it
that are violating uh
you know the the rules
there's so many variables here there
isn't the slightest chance that you
could isolate
the difference for the lockdowns but i
would say that common sense
says that staying away from each other
has got to be better than not
which is not to say that we should keep
the restaurants closed
right i mean i i feel as though the
restaurant situation
we could probably manage that and maybe
the gyms and stuff
so we could definitely do a better job
than the super super restrictive
shutdowns
uh and i think we'd pay for we'd be
willing to pay a little extra infection
for that too
probably it'd be worth it all right um
so in a month trump is going to be off
golfing we think
and we will think less about trump in
the future but not yet
apparently trump is still the only
headline that matters
with one day left but i was listening to
uh biden's daughter
talking about biden's main quality for
leadership and she said the empathy
is what makes him stand out he has
tremendous empathy
you've heard that a lot right it's one
of the it's probably the main
thing that people say about biden you
know they say he's not trump i guess
that's the number one thing
but number two he has all this empathy
to which i say do you know else who else
has that leadership quality
every sentient being turns out that even
sociopaths do show empathy
they just don't act on it they have
empathy they feel it they just don't act
on it
that's what makes a sociopath but even
that was recent news by the way that
even sociopaths have empathy
so biden's main leadership quality
is something that every human being
except for psychopaths
plus every dog possesses
and and you're actually being sold that
this these are his leadership qualities
something that literally your dog
possesses empathy
now i've often said that i would be a
terrible leader
because i have too much empathy
have you ever seen a good leader do they
have lots of empathy
nope in fact the thing that makes a good
leader is a lack of empathy
now that's my personal view and it's the
reason that i can't be a good leader
because sometimes you just have to crush
somebody
to make a better world right somebody's
got to take it on the chin
for somebody else or maybe the larger
good or something but you're always
picking winners and losers
i'm not good at that because i can't
pick the loser
i don't want to be the one that says uh
you're going to have a bad time
so that other people who are not you can
have a better time
i just can't do that so i have too much
empathy the last person who talks to me
is going to influence me too much
so the fake news has sold you that
having lots of empathy
is good when i think it is clearly a
negative
what is empathy going to get you when
you're saying managing
immigration empathy would get you to
open the border
completely because you don't want to
leave anybody behind who's got a bad
life and they want to get a better one
empathy would say just open the border
what would be the obvious outcome of
that
the end of the united states now i don't
think biden is going to go that far
he'll i think he'll be forced to put
some kind of controls on it when the
caravans start coming over
but the point is that the assumption is
wrong
the empathy is a good thing even my
dog has it and it's probably worse it's
probably more bad than good
indeed one of the things i liked about
trump is that he seemed to have
empathy but he could get past it
he could get past it that's sort of what
you need
i would be bad at getting past it so i
wouldn't be a good leader
um the vaccine roll out seems to be a
mess
i don't know if how much of that we
should blame trump for
i feel like probably a lot if we're
being honest
he's still in charge i doubt he's got
his eye on the ball at the moment
during the most important part of the
country i think if you want to criticize
the trump administration for the vaccine
rollout even though the states are the
ones who are
not getting it right they probably
needed funding needed more support
i think this is an example where biden
will do a better job
can can i be can i be objective
and say if i had to guess biden will
probably do a little bit better job
on vaccine rollout don't know yet
i mean we'll have to wait and see and
there'll be nothing to compare it to
because
you know we we don't see what trump
would have done if he'd
had a chance to correct whatever's wrong
um
everybody who's thinking about going to
washington d.c for the inauguration
this is a bad idea whatever your
strategy is
if you're on the right just stay away
from the inauguration stay away from
washington dc
there's no strategy in which that makes
sense
there's not going to be a revolution
nothing's going to change
you can only make things bad for
everybody
whoever supported trump so
stay away from the inauguration
so here's the pattern that we've been
seeing through the trump administration
trump will do some policy that has
obvious
national security implications such as
closing travel from countries where they
can't verify
easily who you are and before that
the so-called muslim ban before they
refined their
their rule it was a it was a rule that
was
bad for those people in those countries
but good for the united states
basically it was discriminatory because
we weren't going to check
people from those countries we're just
going to say that's a problem country so
we won't let you in that was that was
the initial stance
now america first
he's the president and he does get to
say i'm going to
disadvantage another country to
advantage us
that was why he was hired but
so and you can think about several other
examples immigration etc
where what he's doing is clearly for
national security
but cnn and their ilk reported as a
white supremacist
so if you're only watching cnn and you
see that trump is making these national
security moves
but cnn reports it as obvious white
supremacism
what are you going to believe if that's
the only news you watch
so the news is i think it's wrong to
call it the news when it's a little bit
of news and a lot of narrative
i feel like we should stop using the
word news
and maybe even stop using the word fake
news
because it's really just narrative
they're trying to
interpret the news for you they're not
trying to tell you what it is
so then trump does a national security
policy cnn
and their their cousins
all do turn that into white supremacism
their public accepts it because it's on
this thing called the news
and then then you conflate the white
supremacists with q supporters
which are a completely different thing
but of course there's overlap with every
group and every other group in this
country
so then you turn it into q supporters
and
republicans are all part of this white
supremacist thing
either directly or by tacit support
and then then here's the best part then
cnn blames trump for dividing the
country
that wasn't trump did trump divide the
country
by implementing a national security
policy that was bad for other countries
and their citizens but good for us is
that what divided
america no it was cnn that divided
america
and then they they placed the blame on
trump and it got him unelected
uh how will history even report this
will history follow the lead of the
of the narrative uh business
uh that used to be called the fake news
but just called the narrative business
will they report that that's what
happened that trump was divisive and he
did all these white supremacist things
and he divided the country will that
actually be the
history because i didn't see that happen
and i was here
i watched it just like you did i didn't
see that happen
i saw that there are white supremacists
of course
there are bad people everywhere and
what i saw was the news business divide
the country that's all i
saw so we need a
some kind of a yelp review for the news
don't you wouldn't you like to see some
objective entity
whose job it is to do an ongoing report
on the quality of the different news
organizations
now you might say to yourself scott
scott scott
that would be so subjective that it
would just be nonsense
but i'm not sure it would be because i
do think you could create a master list
of things that are hoaxes according to
the left
things that are hoaxes according to the
right and just things that are fact
checked as
pure hoaxes no matter who you are
wouldn't you like to see a ratio that
said how many hoaxes
based on whoever says it's a hoax or not
how many hoaxes
any every entity buys into
wouldn't you because i haven't done the
math but i will bet you that cnn msnbc
were about two to three times the hoax
ratio
of fox news just to pick an example
now that's anecdotal and subjective and
unbiased
so i don't know if that number would
hold but it feels like that it feels
like it was two to one
now i'm going to reverse that for the
coming administration
in all likelihood once trump gets out of
the news
however long that takes once trump is on
the news i've got a feeling that fox
news is going to be telling more
hoaxes and reporting them as if they're
true
because that's the way it goes whoever's
in power the news entity that's
opposite of that ends up having to
create a lot of hoaxes
because the real news isn't bad enough
right
so but i'd like to see some kind of a
yelp industry
because otherwise the news has us uh has
control of the citizens
you need to put something above the news
such as a rating organization
now how would you do it it'd be hard but
i think if you had enough money behind
it
and the right people you could have
people who actually let's say historians
objective people just looking into it
and then scoring things
and maybe you have a maybe you have
judges and maybe you have let's say you
had a dozen judges
and they scored every story for whether
it's a hoax or it's true or is
misleading
and then you just report what the vote
was from the 12 people who were pretty
objective
um i don't know i think we need that
more than anything
um have you noticed that the news can't
quit trump
so there's this this guy don winslow
he's trending today
with the hashtag trump's new army
and i think i think he's some of it's
been removed from twitter for being
too dangerous i i couldn't get to it but
i don't know if it's because i'm blocked
or it got taken down
so fact-check that was his content
removed
by twitter or am i just blocked because
he blocks
people i don't know but i couldn't see
it until i looked on youtube and there
was a video of it and he's got this
video in which he's saying
that the day that trump leaves office
he'll become the de facto
leader of the maga army of white
supremacists and kunan
and that basically you'll have a
domestic army
can you just let trump go can we just
let him golf
now he might be back in some news
related business
entity you know some way which will be
really fun
and i'm looking forward to it but can
you just let it go
let me tell you what trump isn't going
to do
create a domestic army
in fact if you're going to make a list
of all the things that trump might do
the day after and and after he's out of
office i would say
create a domestic army would be dead
last that's not going to happen
and if you're a sucker enough to believe
it is
you've bought into the whole cnn
narrative from day one
i mean you've got to check your thinking
if you think this is happening
but of course it's trending because it's
um you know i've talked to you before
that
the more fake the news is and the more
ridiculous this the more it will trend
because people you know are not going to
get excited about routine stuff that's
just like yesterday
they want something special and when you
hear
trump is raising a mega army
you know like yeah your head lights up
and you're like ah i got to trend that
got to retweet that but those the things
which are most sensational sounding are
also the least likely to be true
this is no exception that would be the
most ridiculous
absurd damaging hoax that
something like that's going to happen
all right um
so here are some steps
that the fake news is doing to demonize
all republicans so step one
you say that the uh the fake news
let's say the the narrative business
will uh tell you that white supremacist
terrorism
is the biggest threat in the country do
you buy that
because that's what we're being told
because the headlines are really
focusing on that biggest threat in the
country white supremacist
terrorism now is there such a thing
as white supremacist terrorism i think
so
i mean i don't know of any examples
i i know that there are white people who
have done
domestic terrorist things i don't know
uh personally i haven't heard of an
example that was because of white
supremacism
but i've heard that people who have that
belief may have done some bad things
um there's there was one in new zealand
that was real
now i'm not saying they don't exist i'm
just saying that i'm not aware of one
so if you say here are three examples
i'd say okay
those are three good examples so i'm not
i'm not arguing that it's not happening
i'm sure it's happening but i live in
this country
and i can't think of one but the
the news is telling you it's the biggest
problem now
i suppose the assault on the capital
would be part of that story i don't know
how many people
in that group are white supremacists or
even trying to do something like a coup
i think the number is zero for the ones
who thought that that was a coup
because how do you do a coup by taking
over an empty room and even if they
captured the vice president
it's not going to work because we would
give the
we would give up the vice president
before we would give control of the
country
to some white supremacists who captured
him so there wasn't any kind of a plan
that could have ever been a coup but it
was reported that way
so now the fake news has told us that
white supremacism is the biggest problem
in the country
if i were going to make a list of the
biggest problems i'd probably have
you know drug and alcohol addiction
overdose deaths mental health
crisis the loneliness crisis especially
lately
the fake news is a bigger problem than
any of this stuff
the the platform censorship will kill us
all eventually
teachers unions who are basically the
main cause of
systemic racism and every problem that
we have in this country
the national debt i'm worried about that
china 10 different problems with china
the green new deal could kill us could
save us but it's a big problem right
so you think the problem is depending on
where you are
the problem is that we're not doing
enough about it or the problem is we'll
do too much about it
but either way big problem right
immigration no matter what you think of
it is a big problem
again you could be on either side of
immigration but it's a big problem
nobody nobody thinks that migrant
caravans
is some kind of an easy good thing it's
a big problem even if you're
in favor of letting them in so so
the fake news or the narrative news has
told us first
the white supremacist that's the thing
that needs to be in front of your mind
that's what you need to be thinking
about and then it says
the narrative news does it says that we
should complete
any trump supporter with white
supremacists now they're saying that
directly
don lemon on cnn says it directly
trump supporters white supremacists not
enough difference to make a
distinction saying it directly
so then after you've done that and
you've
con you've painted all republicans and
trump supporters with that brush
then you have everything you need to
employ
private censorship you know the big tech
companies their censorship
you can do your boycotts because you're
boycotting nazis right
that's easy and you can do your public
shaming so that people can't get jobs
can't get banking
can't get anything and then you also
normalize the violence against
trump supporters which has been
happening for years by calling them
nazis and white supremacists you do
normalize
and approve of violence basically
essentially
that would be different than say black
lives matter right
painting somebody as black lives matter
does not put a target on their back
in fact you might want to help them but
painting somebody as a
white supremacist especially if they're
not
is painting a target on their back it
does normalize violence
then the other thing they do is
disappear the violence on the other side
so now we're learning
that there wasn't much riots and
destruction in washington d.c
when trump was inaugurated or
last summer apparently washington dc is
got a lot of problems a lot of the time
but that's a little de-emphasized
and andrew sullivan is
associated more with the left than the
right but he's one of those few people
who can cross over when something
doesn't make sense
so i like andrew sullivan because he can
call out his own team when they're being
silly
as he did in this case
the i guess the new york times was
saying that last summer was just
isolated instances of property
destruction
versus but that isolated incidences
of property destruction in the capital
that was done by the left
was one to two billion dollars worth of
damage this summer
just this summer one to two billion
dollars worth of damage
and the new york times reports that as
isolated incidents of property
destruction
now you can start to see the narrative
becoming the thing
you know the word fake news actually has
a problem
because it has news in it and i think
it's still useful to have that term
but calling it news anymore just doesn't
even feel
right it's narrative it's narrative
on top of a little bit of news that may
or may not even be true
and certainly out of context so
calling the fake news is sort of a
compliment because it assumes the news
is even part of the mission and that's
clearly not the case
i don't believe there's anybody in
senior management a cnn
who wakes up in the morning and says
gotta inform the public
got to go to my job and make sure the
public knows
the real story i don't think that's
happening
i think they wake up and try to make
money and that's a narrative business
um so let's look at uh biden's
performance
so far i think i got around 20 000
retweets on this which is
huge for my account i might set a record
but here's what i said
i said so far biden has refused to halt
a divisive impeachment
questioned the loyalty of the troops
sparked an
immigration crisis and surrendered to
china
via energy policy you know the paris
climate accord etc
and he hasn't even started the job yet
those are the things he's done
and he hasn't started the job
this is the worst start of any president
of
all time he could have easily made the
impeachment thing go away
calm down the country uh he didn't need
to question the loyalty of the troops
again we're going to come into this
situation where everything that biden
does
has an automatic contrast which is what
did trump do
or what would trump have done in that
situation you can't get away from that
that that comparison is just going to
dog biden the whole way
and let me point this out trump
never had to protect himself from his
own
troops trump
never had to protect himself
from american troops i just have to say
that
three more times trump never had to
protect himself
from american troops
trump never had to protect himself from
american troops
and then the third time i'm going to say
it trump
never had to protect himself from
american troops
is there a worse start of any president
in the history of president starting
things
let me tell you what biden should have
done
let me tell you what he should have done
of course you should be looking for
people who might be
you know a problem so i think the the
deep
vetting of the you know the the people
who will be there guarding that makes
sense
but if you're tossing anybody out for
being a trump supporter
you're making things worse right
you're not making things better let me
put it this way
as a commander-in-chief you are always
in physical danger
because a leader is always a target
right you're always in physical danger
that's why the secret service
exists and part of being a good leader
is knowing when to extend your own
physical danger and when not to
joe biden should have just by
opinion should have extended his own
physical danger and that of
kamala harris and the other major
leaders
he should have taken the risk that
somebody
in the troops you know might have been
had bad intentions
he should have taken the risk that risk
was one the leader should have taken
because if he takes the risk and
everything's fine
then the troops are still loyal we all
believe the troops are loyal
just like always the president has shown
trust in the troops
the troops you know didn't show anything
bad to the commander-in-chief
and we would be at the best place we
could be at the end of it
but biden didn't do that he made exactly
the wrong choice
for a commander-in-chief he said he's
afraid of his own troops
now of course the thing i worry about is
that that's the first step
toward getting some kind of uh you know
private army that protects him and then
you've got a dictatorship because it
might not be biden
but somebody who comes in after him
might inherit this private army and then
you get a lot of trouble
you got saddam hussein situation i'm not
predicting that'll happen
i don't think it will but
wow it's the worst star i've ever seen
for a president and and i feel like i
could add several things to that list
but imagine if trump had done any of
these things i
i hate doing that i hate doing the
imagine if trump had done this what they
would say
but imagine if trump had doubted the
loyalty of the troops
just wrap your head around that is
unthinkable
like the the amount of fallout that
there would be
if trump had doubted the loyalty of the
troops
now do you think trump had any doubts
himself given tds
and the fact that i don't know half
maybe half of the military
is probably anti-trump do you think that
trump
was also at risk i think he was
and i think he took the physical risk
because that was the right play
for the country was it the right play
for trump no
no not not directly meaning that he
would put himself in physical risk
potentially but it would have been the
right play for a leader
he's got a lead from the front all right
um
that's my main points for today
and is there anything i missed
yeah what's going to happen in north
north korea
what's going to happen with funding the
military and by the way you don't hear a
lot about
defund the police anymore do you defund
the police was all over the place
until biden won and they found out that
it was a bad idea
uh somebody says you miss everything
every time scott well that's a
that's a good comment thank you for that
comment that i miss everything every
time
i feel that that was useful you know you
spent your time and a good cause there
thank you i feel i feel that i've been
bettered by it by your constructive
criticism
that i get everything wrong every time
thank you for that
i feel i feel myself correcting now
to full accuracy all right
um
because everything
uh what does your guts say about the
biden win
i mean in terms of whether it was uh
legitimate election here's what my gut
says
i've said this before i'll just
summarize that any any digital system
can be hacked
but the narrative the narrative
is that the election system is the only
one that
that can't be hacked now i say can't
because how would you know
so so treating the election as it's a
given and it's solid
and we must all accept the outcome which
by the way i do accept the outcome
and i have from the start because i
think the system does what the system is
going to do you know biden's the
president
the system decided he was whether or not
the voters decided
is a question that we can't know because
we don't have transparency
so i would say that the
the biden win did not track with my
observations of the of the world so it
did not match my observation
so that's that's a red flag but it
doesn't mean it's wrong right
and i think most of you have the same
experience which is uh
i could see him winning in a squeaker
but i can't see him winning that much
because it just you know my experience
did not suggest that could happen
now there are other people who have said
that for the last four years i've been
talking to enough people that of course
biden was going to win
so there are other people who is
objective uh
let's say not objective but their
observation
is completely consistent with a big win
by biden because
everybody they talked to hated trump so
given given trump's popularity uh
and the the advantage of an incumbent
and all of that i would say that
the election raised questions
which many of them have been answered so
i would say
almost every election fraud claim that
i've seen has been addressed in a way
that
makes me trust the debunk more than the
claim
doesn't mean i'm always right but the
debunks do sound stronger than the claim
ev maybe only because they went second
that always that always sounds stronger
how soon he forgot about bullying
bullying that's what we liked about
trump
was the bullying the bullying was his
feature not his flaws
i'm not sure if that's what the comment
was getting to but
we those who supported trump wanted a
bully
they wanted somebody to bully the people
who needed to get bullied
other countries china north korea
democrats so that's kind of what they
wanted
now is there some blow back from having
a bully yeah it looks like
bully is a one one term president
probably
um oh talking about bullies
preventing the uh the observers
yeah so we didn't have as much uh
transparency in the observation we don't
have enough transparency in the code
there are probably lots of ways that an
election could be you know
rigged in small ways we wouldn't have
visibility to it
but i would say that if the
trump team didn't put together a
convincing package of these strong
claims
and just make a good show of that and
that didn't happen
all right we observed that there was no
strong package of claims
they were all all of the claims seemed
to be
combined with weak ridiculous stuff
about venezuela and italy and stuff
so everything looked like trash because
it was combined with the trash
but i think they're some of the
statistical arguments
i haven't heard one way or the other
about them
now the statistical arguments don't
prove any kind of fraud
they just say hey you should look here
and if they say hey you should look here
they did a recount
that's all we have we can't look any
deeper than that
we uh scott is acting like legitimate
claims were heard from any courts
no i'm not saying that at all my
understanding
is that the courts saw a few
if any of the actual claims part of that
is because they weren't presented to the
court
for reasons i don't know part of it is
that the
the cases were thrown out for technical
reasons so they were never judged
some of them because the claims weren't
big enough to change anything so the
court said
get out of here but the courts were
irrelevant
to the question of whether there was any
impropriety in the election if you
believe that the courts
told you something they would be useful
to understand whether
the election was as fair as you wanted
it to be those are just disconnected
things
there's what the court did and there's
whatever happened in the election but
the court
the court doesn't know what's the court
now
they don't know any more than you do
all right um now just because things
were tossed for technicalities doesn't
mean they weren't debunked
so almost everything that i saw claimed
was either
ridiculous on the surface the venezuela
stuff or
was debunked by somebody who had enough
information to debunk it
there are a few things that i haven't
heard a debunk for but that doesn't mean
they're not debunked
all right i've never heard of this book
sinclair's book all right one other
thing i want to leave you before i go
my profile if you will in this realm
of talking about i guess politics and
life and strategies and stuff
it has been you know increasing over
time with these live streams
and there's a weird thing happening
which is people are sending me
massive amounts of research material
and gigantic emails with multiple points
and usually it's because they want to
win me over to their side
because they think i'll be a good
advocate or they're filling in some
blanks
something they think i should know to
make my presentation better
so what i want to tell you is that i
can't look at all those
there are so many things being sent to
me now just
long emails and complicated messages
and you know what do you think of this
book
so most things i won't be able to
respond to some things i'll be able to
skim
but somebody says how do we email
don't don't i'm telling you don't email
me
because it's a waste of time if you had
asked me six months ago i would say yeah
send me a message
i'll take a look but i can guarantee you
that you have a very low chance of me
looking at anything that's
more than say several sentences
so anything beyond several sentences
just assume i'm not going to look at it
even if it's valuable and even if i
should and
even if i ask for it i just don't have
the capacity at the moment
all right i'm going to be trying today
to go and take a honey boon
yes a delayed honeymoon i will keep from
you
my secret location if all goes well the
next time you hear from me will be from
not this room uh there will i think
there will be at least
one day in which i'll be traveling
during the
the time of the uh the sip um
so if there's one day you don't see me
by 702
and i haven't tweeted about it probably
i'm not going to show up that day but it
should be just one day
otherwise as long as they have as long
as they have wi-fi
uh and yes it's my honeymoon yes
christine is going with me on my
honeymoon
but thanks for asking
yeah it's a delayed honeymoon because we
got married during covet so we
trying to figure out what works and what
doesn't i'll tell you later
where it's at but for now you don't need
to know and i'll talk to you
tomorrow i think i think i'll talk to
you tomorrow
all right bye for now
