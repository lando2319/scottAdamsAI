good morning everybody
and it's time
for another rousing edition of coffee
with scott adams the best thing that
happens in the universe
except for the sun itself and if you'd
like to make it better well all you need
is a copper marker glass a tanker
chelsea stein a canteen jogger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day
this sim
somebody says i simply tolerate scott
well thank you
some of some of you like the content but
others are here for the tolerance and i
appreciate it
so join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the w today i think it makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
go
ahead
my ass good stuff
well in portland
the
people in charge have decided that
instead of using the police
which as you know are overfunded in
portland according to portland
instead of using their limited police to
break up violence between opposing
political groups in the city
they decided to stand back and let them
fight
because they were just using things like
sprays and
clubs and stuff like that it wasn't
especially dangerous until the gunfire i
guess i guess the police got involved
when there were shots fired but until
then they actually just stood back and
observed
and they let the two opposing sides
fight it out
to which i say
thank you
i have never agreed with mayor wheeler
more
than right this
moment they're letting them fight it out
i don't know what could end it faster
right
because it seems to me that if you try
to break it up and you keep them from
hurting each other too much or too many
people getting hurt they'll just come
back
but what happens if you let it let them
fight it out a few times
i think fewer people show up next time
you know if you got your head broken
probably you don't go back i don't know
so we'll try that and i like it in the a
b testing sense of things
so while common sense tells you hey put
those police in there and stop that
fighting on your streets
let's try this
it could work
i'm not saying it will
i don't think you could quite predict
that it'll come to a good end if you let
them fight
but we haven't tried it
let's give it a try
if portland wants to
be the test case for a let them fight
i say put some bleachers in there and
sell tickets and let's go nuts
well
i think i predicted to you that
afghanistan has some surprises coming
i didn't know exactly what the surprises
would be but one thing you can be sure
of
that whenever you've got one of these
fog of war or chaotic situations
something is going to come out of this
that you say to yourself
what
how did that happen you know just
something
completely
on the left field that explains
everything now i don't know what that'll
be
but there's a weird thing happening now
in slow motion that i don't understand
and it goes like this
the americans are getting out of
afghanistan without violence
mostly right you're hearing anecdotal
stories of somebody who doesn't want to
cross a checkpoint
stories of the taliban taking away
passports something like that it's
probably happening because i doubt the
taliban has such command and control
that they can
control every checkpoint
but overall
am i wrong
that the
that the by the administration
seems to think he could get the people
out
on time by the end of the month
and that it's going peacefully
now here's the weird thing
you know your your unintended
consequences and we're all geniuses
aren't we all geniuses
we can predict exactly what will happen
in every international situation
because we're so smart
but here's something
that might have accidentally happened
the best case scenario
i'm not going to say it's true yet and
certainly i think all evidence suggests
that the withdrawal was botched
so my my first take if you remember was
hold hold
we need to find out more information it
looks botched
but wait there might be something we
don't know about because why is it we
all see it botched but the people in
charge all did the thing that was
obviously wrong
like there's something to explain that
we don't know yet so i say oh wait
but i waited
i waited for the administration to give
us its version of the story and
just sounds botched
maybe there's more to it
but it just sounds botched so far and i
i say that only from the perspective of
the administration didn't really put up
a fight you know they didn't give you an
argument
that they did it right that made any
sense you know they're saying they did a
good job but you know they're not really
supporting that argument
so here's the
here's the most optimistic thing you
could say
and i'm not saying it's true
it's just interesting that it's possible
and in fact
maybe more possible than the alternative
and it goes like this
the way this came down
was the least loss of death
possible under all scenarios
i think that's where it's heading
that this is accidentally totally
botched
but accidentally gave us the best
outcome
why
because afghanistan fell so quickly what
could have been the safest thing to
happen in afghanistan
i hate to say it but if it's inevitable
the taliban is going to take over the
safest thing is to surrender right away
that's what happened so we didn't see it
coming we weren't prepared for it
but it was the safest thing
just complete surrender on day one
because otherwise you have the fight
and you still surrender i mean you get
to the same place right
so
and then but the second part and the
part we're obsessing on is the
withdrawal
you know that's completely botched right
does everybody agree
that we're all the experts and we would
have gotten the people out they wanted
to be evacuated we would have done that
first before we got rid of most of the
military now we did put military back in
but they're not getting people etc so
it's still botched
no doubt about it but
so far
the taliban
has been playing as strategically very
smart
and the strategic smart thing for the
taliban to do would be to give us a
deadline that's
a little challenging but possible
and they did that
apparently at least according to the
biden administration
that deadline is challenging
but possible
like you know we we have a really good
chance of getting really close to
achieving it
now
so far that's pretty reasonable
for uh you know a group that's known for
its unreasonable
uh actions
what happens if i'll just put this as a
hypothetical it's not a prediction
it's a hypothetical and things are
heading in this direction
what happens if the hostages not the
oxygens well they might be what happens
if the people we want to evacuate
including the afghan interpreters and
the people who we want to get out what
happens if we get them all out
isn't this going to look like the
biggest success of all
times at the same time it was botched
believe it or not they can happen at the
same time
you can botch everything and just get
lucky
that's what it looks like
it looks like everything was botched
and so far fingers crossed
you know there's no reason to think
it'll go this way all the way to the end
but fingers crossed
they avoided a civil war by collapsing
immediately
and if we get the people out
which looks like it's happening
it's the best thing that could have
happened
am i wrong about that
i mean if you're just counting uh bodies
how could we have done better than this
assuming that we do get the evacuees out
now that's a big big assumption right
but so far
so far it's happening
now i'm not saying that's you're saying
it's delusional it's not delusional
because it's put in
in uh a statistical sense right it could
happen
it's just unlikely
i mean if you if you had to predict
wouldn't you predict that the taliban
will not let everybody out
keep a bunch of hostages
most obvious thing right
and i feel like inevitably they're going
to keep a few
but let's say i'll just give you a
number let's say they keep
20
i don't know 20 americans that didn't
get out
and but we get everybody else out
so suppose we lose 20 souls they happen
to be american
what did we avoid
probably
a hundred thousand deaths
50 000 if the civil war happened
so biden may have accidentally
traded
20 american lives this is just a
speculation this not based on data
he could have accidentally traded 20
lives to save 50 000 afghans
is that immoral well it's not america
first
but i don't know if it's immoral
you know you could argue that one
all right um
rasmussen poll asked if taliban takes
american hostages should the u.s use
military to rescue them and 78 say yes
is that good news or bad news
it's good news
because the taliban needs to know
that we're going to get our hostages out
or there's going to be big trouble
hostages slash evacuees
and having 78 of the public say yes send
the military in
while about the same amount of the of
the public says get adams to afghanistan
that is exactly the right situation
for the taliban to say
you know
if we don't let everybody out we're
really effed
right
so this is the best poll i've ever seen
in my life
because it says the american public are
completely on the same side i mean 78 is
as good as you can get in the american
public
and then uh rasmussen poll also asked
is the biden administration doing enough
to evacuate americans and 59 said no
and
i think this is under the category of
how could you do enough
you know really
how could you do enough
you know it's always going to look like
it wasn't soon enough didn't do enough
but it does look like it's not enough
all right
here's the question
that i asked on twitter
and
this is a this topic will be
more about persuasion
than about whether you should get a
vaccination can we agree that i don't
care if you get vaccinated everybody
everybody i don't care if you get
vaccinated so anything i say next
is going to be about vaccination
persuasion but it's not intended to work
on you
really it's not a trick
right let me say it again this is not
some kind of like backward psychology
hypnosis trick i really don't want to
persuade you on this i really really
don't it's totally unethical because
it's a
you know it's a health decision you got
to make your own decision on that i'll
persuade you on politics
i'll be happy to do that i'll persuade
you on how to live your life better how
to have systems instead of goals i'll
persuade you on all kinds of stuff
but not your health decisions
not that
that's on you totally
but let's talk about the persuasion game
because it's happening whether i
participate or not
and omar khatib alerted me to uh there's
a series of tweets from advertising
insider
in which they asked some advertising uh
professionals
what
the governments could do to persuade
more people to get the vaccination
now
did the advertising executives
say much the same thing i did
which is hold on
even if we could
even if we could
persuade people to get the vaccinations
it would be unethical
so
let me back out of this conversation
right away because i'm a marketing
professional and i'm not going to cross
that ethical barrier
well that didn't happen
instead they gave you pretty good
specific suggestions
for doing the most unethical thing in
the world
persuading people to get a health
outcome a particular
treatment
so here are some of their persuasion
points and i'm going to evaluate them so
you can get a little lesson on
persuasion at the same time number one
are marketing executives good at
persuasion
anybody
anybody
who works at a big company where there
are professional marketing people
are those professional marketing people
trained in persuasion let's say the way
i am
i'm a hypnotist etc
do you think they have the same kind of
persuasion training as
this cartoonist
no
not even close
but they do have a lot of tools so they
can do polls and they can do
focus groups and they can a b test
things
so they can use brute force
to get to a good outcome because you can
just randomly try stuff
semi-randomly and then just test it and
see if it works and then do more of the
stuff that works so that's marketing
but here's what marketers are not good
at
the first try
because almost nobody is right the the
first thing you try isn't necessarily
going to work
so
here are some of their first things to
try
from uh let's see uh this is from uh
these are different marketing executives
this from jim lasser
suggests using humor to disarm those who
oppose the vaccine
nope
nope
you can use humor
uh it'll maybe make a good commercial
for selling your soap or your beer
but humor isn't going to change your
health care decisions
i'm sorry it just isn't
now
maybe he's right
that's why you test it right
so what what is the value of my opinion
on the initial input the thing that you
could test
well
i think my opinion is pretty good better
than the average because i study this
field
but i could be wrong maybe you test this
and it's exactly the right thing but i
doubt it
my instinct tells me the humor
is not where you go on this
definitely not in fact
i would go with fear
the opposite of humor humor is hahaha
i'm relaxed i'm having a good time
that's not the head you want to put
people in if you want somebody to do
something as radical as putting a needle
in their arm you've got to scare the
 out of them
right
that'll work you got to scare them
i don't think anything else will work
let's go on with these other ideas
he said that the same guy said that the
stickiness of puns can be effective
i don't know about that
now the stickiness of puns in terms of
wordplay
that does have some scientific support
if the glove doesn't fit you must acquit
sort of word play it's a rhyme the rhyme
does actually
create some persuasion so science
supports that
but that's not enough to get somebody
vaccinated all right
um
another another guy said a marketing
professional said let's turn it from
you've got to get protected
to let's uh fm
track this thing down and kill it so
mike lee i think said that uh
well i'm not sure about the attribution
but the idea is that you got to get
tough with it
talk tough and then people say yeah
let's go to war against that virus
terrible idea terrible idea
i mean
i i don't i don't even know what to say
about it it's just a terrible idea
all right so forget that one
another said that
that who originally cast a doubt on the
vaccine should play the trump card
and give him credit for starting the
vaccine program and directing the
resources
possibly the worst of all the ideas
if you bring trump into the conversation
of vaccinations
do people even try to make a medical
decision
no
as soon as you add trump to the
conversation it's a political
conversation it doesn't matter
what the data is you throw trump into
any conversation about health care and
it's just a trump conversation so this
is a horrible idea
like really really really bad
from this marketing professional don't
throw trump into the conversation that
just makes everything worse
all right here's another one
an effective campaign we have to find
people who are anti-vaccine
and and convert them
so you'd have to find the anti-vaccine
people and get them to be pro-vaccine
and then help sell it
would that uh convince you
if you saw somebody who is anti-vaccine
let's say let's say you are
and they were that anti-vaccine just
like you
but unlike you they had changed to be
pro-vaccine would that change your mind
no
no
no it wouldn't
not even for a second the first thing
you say is well they bought off another
there's another sheep
looks like another sheep went to
slaughter
no it would be the least persuasive
thing in the world to see what other
people are doing
now
suppose all you did was show that smart
good-looking people were getting
vaccinated and the people who were not
getting vaccinated were unhealthy
looking slobs who make lots of bad
decisions in general
well that might work
that might work not a specific person
because we we discount celebrities
opinions completely but what if it was a
a montage
of smart beautiful looking people
getting vaccinated
and you know obese
bad decision makers not getting
vaccinated
that might work because people are
tribal and they'd say oh i want to be in
that tribe not that tribe
so
i mean it would move some people in
either direction but i think your net
would be good and when i say that again
remember you'd have to test it
i'm not smart enough nor is anybody
to know what will work without testing
it persuasion doesn't really work that
way even though even the hypnotist
even the hypnotist who's hypnotizing you
in real time just the two of you in a
room
that hypnotist is still a b testing
because you're trying stuff you're
looking at the reaction try something
else look at the reaction so without the
testing you don't really have a system
for persuasion
they have to be part of the team all
right here's some more
you shouldn't assume everyone is
motivated by politics okay that's real
helpful
because
well how does that persuade you i guess
the point is to make it non-political
but we've tried that that didn't seem to
make any difference
um someone who is pregnant and also a
marketing professional
said that she was persuaded by someone
by hearing from people who are genuinely
concerned for you
interesting so her suggestion was that
she was persuaded
by hearing from people who were
genuinely concerned for her
now we're getting closer
now
now that's some real um real persuasion
at least
good thinking
because we are persuaded by people who
genuinely care for us
why is it that you don't think the
pharmaceutical companies can be trusted
because they don't care for you
why is it that you don't think the
government could be trusted
they don't care for you why do you not
believe the the pundit you see on the
news
don't care for you
in fact it might be the same pundit who
wants to hunt you down
it might be
in a lot of cases
so now
most of the people telling you to get
the vaccination are people who don't
care for you
literally don't care about you one bit
they don't even know you you're a
stranger
but how persuasive would be somebody who
actually does care for you
now they may not be experts on
vaccinations
but i'll bet it is persuasive
so i don't know how you could ramp that
up to get lots of concerned people
talking to vaccinated people or and i'm
not suggesting you should
i'm just saying that at least this is
genuine persuasion smartness you know it
looks like something you could test
all right here's another one
you should treat the campaign for the
vaccination persuasion with the kind of
budget and tactics you'd see a political
party use to get out the vote
i think they did
didn't they
wouldn't you say that the government did
exactly that used the same kind of mass
persuasion as get out the vote i feel
like that's sort of a non answer that's
a very
marketing meeting answer
all right here's my take so i'm going to
add my own
persuasion suggestions again
i'm not trying to persuade you i'm
teaching you how to do persuasion
okay can can we all deal with that
distinction
not trying to persuade you
that would be unethical but i'll tell
you how persuasion works
i think you need a fake because
in other words i think there are a bunch
of people who are close to being
persuaded and would like to
but they're still stuck in their old
opinion
so they need to fake because
something that they can say oh
something changed
so now my old opinion was right
but now my new opinion is right too
because something changed so you need
that fake because the something changed
the fda approval might be that so i
think some people are going to say even
though the polls suggest it's not going
to make much difference i think it will
i think the polls are misleading
i think that the fda approval is even
going to make the moderna
vaccination more popular even though it
doesn't have fda approval people are
going to kind of expect that it will get
it because the pfizer got it
so there's some you know crossover
persuasion that the pfizer thing will
make the modern thing look safer even
though they're different things it's
just how your brain works
so the fake because
i would look for other fake because not
just the fda approval but how about
we've waited long enough
that the odds of
problems
are way down because you would have seen
most of them you know pop up
that would be fake because but there
could be others too
as i said you need fear and visual
persuasion anything less is barely
trying so you need to show people die in
a covet like in the worst possible ways
and saying i should have gotten the
vaccination and then dying
and there are plenty of anecdotes like
that
cnn is
promoting that kind of persuasion with
their their story choices
and uh i think it works i mean you could
argue that cnn shouldn't be in the
persuasion game
but unfortunately they are and i would
say that those anecdotal you know
terrible visuals where you can sort of
put yourself in the bed you say oh i can
see myself being that guy
don't be that guy
all right um
show people that you like getting
vaccinated that's similar to showing the
you know the
two groups you know one is beautiful and
one is not
um i would also like to see an expert
explaining risk management to people
you've never seen that except me and i'm
far from an expert
if you if you can't show me let's say
nate silver
i like to use him because a lot of you
disagree with some of his opinions
so he's sort of perfect for this you can
disagree with his opinions
but not his rationale
meaning that his his thinking process is
generally pretty close to flawless
is it's his field
he knows how to think statistically he's
good at it
wouldn't you like to see somebody who is
just just flat out good at it
maybe a few of them so you've got a few
different opinions explaining to you the
risk benefit
thinking through all of the risks we
know about
and all the ones we don't
putting some kind of statistics on them
and just walking you through it say okay
here's the risk of getting vaccinated
all these potential risks here's what we
know about them
here's the risk of not getting
vaccinated here's what we know about it
put some numbers on it
i think that would be at least a fake
because for some people some people
would say you know nobody ever explained
it that well
right
all right let me let me uh
okay here here's the persuasion that
would work you ready for this again i'm
not suggesting it this is an example of
what would work
you take nay silver
and you say you sit down for a couple
hours
with uh mike rowe
you all know mike rowe if you're not
american you might not
mike rose a famous personality who is
sort of an every man
he does what's called dirty jobs he did
a show where he would do like these
awful jobs where you literally get
physically dirty you know doing gross
stuff
so he's famous for being like a
a level-headed
rational person who just
can see how to get stuff done
right that's sort of his brand
so you take it nate silver
and you spend two hours with micro
teaching him how to look at the
statistics
and then you have mike rowe
explain the statistics to the public
why because if nay silver does it you're
not going to understand it
right he's almost too good
because his explanation would have
enough nuance in it to be accurate but
maybe a little confusing because you
can't follow the nuance of statistics
but you take that stuff and you package
it up with mike rowe
a really really credible voice
especially to the right who has a lot of
a lot of resistance
micro could sell the out of this
you really could
now people are saying is he a scientist
is he a statistician no
no
he's he's you
that's why it works
do you know who would be the most
persuasive person for you the person who
would convince you specifically
the best
would be you
if you could make a digital version of
yourself
and give it a script written by somebody
who knows what they're talking about and
then that digital version talks you into
getting vaccinated it would be the most
persuasive thing that could happen you
couldn't beat that
right
mike rowe
is you
that's sort of
his brand you know i don't i hate to
characterize other people because he
might not
want to characterize himself that way
which is unfair
but in my
in my view the thing that makes him
popular is you say yeah i think just
like that that's
you know micro is saying the words
coming out of his mouth are the ones i'm
thinking but he's saying it better than
i'm thinking it that's the ultimate
he says what you're thinking
but he says it better than you're
thinking it
somebody says why a white person that's
a good question
if you could if you could take the same
concept
and replace micro with i'm going to say
charles barkley just to pick a name
right i picked charles barkley because i
don't know if anybody's been more
popular with everybody
if you don't follow basketball that's an
unfamiliar reference but charles barkley
is black
but his sort of approach to race is so
commonsensical
that it just appeals to left and right
in a weird kind of way
so yeah you take a charles barkley who
everybody likes and he's famous for
being a
plain talker common sense kind of guy
yeah that's that's actually that might
even be an upgrade on my idea i think
mike road be great
but yeah a charles barkley absolutely he
could do that
somebody says steve harvey
maybe
i know i i think charles barkley is more
relatable
i feel like more more the you know the
every man talks like you do kind of
thing
um
and here's another idea
it seems to me that the anti-vaxxers um
like to call the people who are taking
the vaccination sheep
what would trump do if he were the
recipient of a thing like that he'd take
the gun out of their hand and he'd turn
it around
so
if uh here's a little vac little uh
persuasion tip
the things that people call you
are things that they personally think
are persuasive
so if the anti-vaxxers are calling you
sheep for getting vaccinated what would
be the most
piercing thing you could call them
sheep they've given you the answer
you don't have to wonder what's the
worst thing that you could say about
them because they told you
it's what they're calling you
sheep
so if you could find a way and again
this is persuasion i'm not saying you
should do this it's just how it works
if you could find a way to make the
people not getting vaccinated
and label them sheep
in all likelihood that would really hurt
because it's the word they use when
they're insulting other people if you
can make that stick to the person using
the word
it's gonna hurt a little extra
so that would be an approach
um also the anti-vaxxers tend to be
conspiracy theorists or
the only people who are right
two possibilities right
either they are subject to believing
conspiracies
or they're right and we'll all find out
later
but
uh in terms of
persuasion
if you came up with a conspiracy theory
that worked in the other direction
hypothetically
it could persuade people so in other
words you would need a counter
conspiracy theory
a conspiracy theory that says for
example
that china is the one telling you that
the vaccinations are dangerous
because they probably are
i don't know if that's true
but
i would guess
that china and russia are messing with
our communications about the vaccines
just like they do with our
our social structure and our politics
right
so it seems to me
um
let me check this
seems to me that you can do a counter
conspiracy theory all right
um
when i asked people to describe to me
how vaccines make things worse i got a
ton of cognitive dissonance
i'm going to give you the hypnotists
filter
on how to see the world
so the question i asked is how could it
be that so many people think that
vaccinations
make the variance worse
so that's a
a very popular thought and may be true
might be true that the vaccinations make
variance worse
so i asked the following question can
you describe the mechanism for how that
could possibly happen because
everybody's sure of it
i mean it seems like the entire public
is sure that's true
but i said well describe how exactly
that works
and
what happened was
and this is the hypnotist filter
so my filter on this is probably
different than yours your filter is
probably
something like this
some people are right
and some people are wrong
some people are well informed they did
their own research
some people are not
and to you i would think that that's all
there is to this vaccination makes
variance worse question
somebody's right somebody's wrong
the hypnotist filter is different
the hypnotist filter says this
there were a lot of people who who
publicly and to their friends have said
i understand this issue it's basic
evolution
if you put evolutionary pressure on the
normal virus it will give an advantage
to the variant
boom scott i just explained it evolution
101 just apply it to this situation and
you're done anybody can understand this
evolution is survival of the fittest
the fittest variant will be the one that
can get through the vaccination right
pretty logical
okay here's my view of the world
my view of the world is that when people
realize they couldn't explain
how a vaccination makes a very into
worse
that they spun into cognitive dissonance
and when you look at my tweet and you
see the comments you'll see there's all
word salad
but
it'll be word salad you think makes
sense
because the person who wrote it thinks
it makes sense let me give you some i
know you're skeptical i'm going to read
you some of the explanations of people
who are very smart by the way so
everybody who gave these explanations of
how evolution would um you know cause
the variance to be dominant
they're smart people
but
they're showing all the tells of
cognitive dissonance i'll give you some
examples well so far let's start with
this whiteboard let's say there are two
situations there's a person with no
vaccination and a person who's
vaccinated let's say this the
non-vaccinated person gets the regular
alpha
virus
but
it mutates inside them
and the mutation is a new variant and
then it spreads
everybody agrees that can happen
right
that it can happen that you can get the
regular virus
but it mutates inside the person
and then what comes out the other end is
a new variant and then that variant
could spread that's if you don't have a
vaccination
but what if you do have a vaccination
well in that case the alpha various
virus goes in
it mutates
and then a new variant comes out
and it spreads
what was the difference between the
vaccinated person and the no vaccinated
person
nothing
because both of them have have the virus
in them both of them can spread it
there's no difference
so now everybody who is positive there's
a difference
has to explain
this
and that triggers cognitive dissonance
now let me say as clearly as possible
i don't know if vaccinations
cause more variance
i don't know i mean i legitimately don't
know
and i'm not sure i even am
biased in one direction
all i do know is that when people try to
explain it their spending is spinning
into cognitive dissonance that i do know
so i can say that with great confidence
you know it's something i study so let
me give some examples
again these are smart people with smart
explanations
um
a vaccine which targets a specific part
of a virus will mean the small mutations
in the virus can survive while the
targeted virus cannot
since viruses are mutating all the time
eventually one of these mutants
aka variants will become dominant
how'd that happen
how did one of them become dominant
just by being more viral right
in my example the vast or the
unvaccinated person
which of these cases
is there going to be more variants
well i would say that the vaccinated
person has less virus to begin with and
less chance of spreading it
so i would think there would be fewer
variants if you got vaccinated
i don't know that that's true i'm just
saying that's where the logic takes it
with you know the limited information i
have
so here's my question what would what
would make the variant
survive
and i'm hearing things like well the old
virus and the new variant are fighting
it out and uh one is one is compelled
nothing compels a virus
if you have two viruses in you they both
would spread if you had the delta
spreads if you have the other one the
spreads so i can see why there would be
more
uh
well actually there's just no mechanism
described here
now
then other people use uh analogies
but the analogies fall apart i'll give
you one analogy that was used if you're
trying to breed small dogs
let's say you kill all the big dogs and
then you breed the small ones
and then you do the same round again
whatever the largest puppies are you
kill all of them
and then only small puppies grow up and
then they have babies and they're small
right so that's the analogy
so so the virus would be like that
no i wouldn't because the virus doesn't
kill all puppies
the virus doesn't kill all anything
it just reduces it
so the analogy would be if you're trying
to
breed small puppies you take all puppies
and kill 10 of them
how does that help
so the analogy just falls apart
because there there's always some
difference in the analogy from the
original it's a big difference
so there's that all right so some of you
in the comments are saying uh survival
of the fittest
how many of you in the comments
think that survival of the fittest
can explain why the the big variants get
out
past the vaccines
and the the weaker ones don't is it
survival of the fittest because that's
the thing right you've all studied
evolution
survival of the fittest
how many of you know that survival of
the fittest is not science
and that it's not evolution
and the survival of the fittest doesn't
exist
how many of you know that
how many of you know that the theory of
evolution does not include
survival of the fittest
that's completely debunked
how many of you knew that
somebody somebody was about to say that
and do you know who debunked it
stephen j gould
i i think probably the top evolutionary
biologist in the country i think he's
passed away now but it's debunked
by the top evolutionary evolution
scientist and agreed by all of
all of science
there's nobody in the
evolution field
who thinks
survival of the fittest
is a thing
did you know that because so many of you
said we have survival of the fittest you
just apply it to the virus
but it doesn't exist anywhere
it's not a thing
most people think it is it's sort of
like people believe that trump said you
know
the nazis were fighting people people
think that trump said drink bleach it
just didn't happen
none of those things happened and
there's no such thing
as survival of the fittest it doesn't
exist
do you know what does exist instead
survival of things that didn't die
it's a big difference
right so if you had a you know a species
that was just perfectly well suited but
then
let's say a uh
say a tsunami kills everybody
were was that group unfit
no they just had bad luck there was a
tsunami they got them all
right so there's luck and there's
survival of things that survive but
that's it
there's just survival of things that
survived so in the world of survival of
things that survive which is the whole
explanation just some things survive
they get lucky that's it
no it's not semantics it's not even
close to just being semantics if you
don't see the difference between
survival of the fittest
and survival of the random
you're missing a really big point i'm
saying that the way we evolve is
survival of the random it's not the
fittest
sometimes it is
but it's coincidence
all right um
so it's not so much natural selection
it's just chance would be a better way
to say it it's just chance
so i don't see how chance
can be part of the explanation
um but
we are warned by ian martis that there's
a bigger
risk called original antigenic sin how
many of you have heard of that
raise your hands if you've ever heard of
original antigenic sin
i'm going to try to explain it but
forgive me because i don't understand
this field well enough so i'll give you
the dumb person's you know the idiots
definition it goes like this if your
immune system has been trained against a
particular attacker let's say a virus
you're you have uh
a kind of uh immunity memory and that
immunity memory
um could work against you as well as for
you and the way it could work against
you is that when a new virus comes in a
variant let's say your immune system
says i know i know exactly what to do
and it ramps up to fight the virus but
it's a different virus it's just one
that's like it
now your immune system is all ramped up
to fight the wrong thing
it's actually working overtime on the
wrong thing because it said i think that
virus is a lot like that other one so it
goes to work on the wrong virus
and then the right one just has a you
know clear channel
now
that apparently that's a real thing
which has happened in the past in
different situations so
just know that that's out there
all right um
i don't know what the size of that risk
is actually
um
and that is what i wanted to talk about
today
uh i'm gonna run and do something else
and
uh i hope you don't hate the persuasion
lessons in the context of these boring
topics like vaccinations and masks and
stuff like that i think i think the
persuasion stuff is interesting
and
if you don't let me know but i think
that you learn something when you see
the persuasion element
separate from the science all right
that's it for now
