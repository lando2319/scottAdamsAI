morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome
to the most specialist coffee with Scott
Adams of all time it's normally the
highlight of civilization but somehow
with the help of the amazing Erica we've
taken it to a new level
that's right today's simultaneous sip
has a little something special for some
of us now these are already sold out so
I don't know when we're going to make
more but you're going to see the
official coffee with Scott Adams mug
as part of the simultaneous step now you
don't all have them but you're still
going to be part of the greatness either
way and all you have to do to be part of
this amazing moment we've been waiting
for so long is you need a cup of mug or
a glass of tank which I'll sustain the
canteen children flaska Festival any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
but uh
I like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine the other day the thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now
go
ah
if you were watching instead of
listening on the podcast and wishing we
weren't making slobbering sounds on your
audio
well sorry about that but I had to show
people that the bottom of the mug says
Ah
every mug should have a little message
on the bottom
so yes
this is the
simultaneous sip official coffee with
Scott Adams mug
it's all here
it's beautiful it's exactly the right
size and heft and I have to say
I have to say is actually the best
physical mug I've ever had
that's actually true it's really hard to
find just the right shape and size and
heft this is actually perfect
so I'll probably get a probably get a
few more
all right
um
you have to make mic sounds to
desensitize people okay
well did you all see on Twitter that
Kathy Griffin was suspended I think
permanently
from Twitter
uh for impersonating another person
and I don't know if impersonating
another person is exactly what gets you
kicked off
but if you're impersonating uh Elon Musk
you're definitely going to get picked
kicked off
so it took about five minutes for
somebody to produce a meme of Elon Musk
holding a severed Kathy Griffin head
going like this it was like five minutes
from news to me because I think it's a
new record
now I don't think it's a joke
that the that the right memes better
than the left that's actually true right
or do I just see maybe maybe my
perception is sort of filtered wrong is
it true
because it definitely feels true
all right it feels very true
strange but also uh oh
this is sad
Ethan Klein got suspended too
Ethan Klein
he was one of my mascots oh
I hate it when one of my mascots gets
gets kicked off of Twitter so sad so sad
all right well honestly I have mixed
opinions about this
remember when Kathy Griffin did this
severed head of trump and uh I defended
her I defended her and still do
because you know joke's a joke and you
know there there's just you know you
might want to warn somebody away from
that kind of joke but you know I'm a
little bit more flexible on humor than
most people are probably because I do it
for a living
um I don't know this one's an edge case
to me I feel like a warning would have
been good enough what do you think
do you think a warning would have been
the better play
because here's why
the these well hold on let me let me
make my argument before you have your
final opinion
Elon musk's biggest challenge right now
is to prove that he's going to support a
free speech
for both sides am I right
yeah that's his biggest challenge he has
to show that he's creating a platform
that works for both sides that that's
almost impossible like I said well I
think he can do it actually but it's
going to be really hard
I think that if you kick off two famous
lefties
for speech now you could say it's for
impersonating somebody and that's part
of the terms of service the terms of
service very clearly say if you don't
identify yourself as a parody
very clearly that you know you could get
kicked off but here's the thing
were they really not identified as
parody
I mean really no I get that they didn't
have a
you know an actual notice on them but
you could see their actual Twitter
account
and probably within a minute you
probably saw comments saying it wasn't
real
and I don't know that it did that much
damage
um as someone who has been impersonated
a number of times it happens to public
figures I've been impersonated quite a
few times
and it's not it's not the thing I go the
hardest on
like there are some things I'm you know
like fentanyl for example like I'm I'm a
total hard ass on that but this is a
little bit more in the area of fun
so I'm really really flexible when
somebody's just having fun
but this is sort of an edge case isn't
it were they just having fun or were
they trying to hurt Elon Musk what do
you think actually let me ask you do you
think they were just having fun
both Kathy Griffin and well let me tell
you what Ethan climbed in so he he
changed his uh name on Twitter to Elon
Musk and then he tweeted a bunch of pro
Geoffrey Epstein stuff as if he were
doing it in musk's name
is that just having fun
is that having fun
it's really it's here here's why this is
more of a gray area than you think
if something like that happened to you
that's not cool
so let me agree with you if any of you
had that happen to you get impersonated
and and defamed like that that's not
cool that's not cool at all
but here's what most of you don't
experience
being famous
people just have to sort of get over it
you know what I mean like you can't do
what I do
and be super sensitive about what people
are saying about you right you got to be
a little bit flexible when you're in
this line of business
but Elon Musk isn't exactly in my line
of business
he's a business person he's trying to
run a legitimate business so this this
challenge is honestly this challenges
every one of our
Freedom versus Badness
you know borders
and I have to say that I would slightly
disagree with musk on both of these
suspensions and let me be clear
I don't like Ethan Klein
he's coming he came after me on Twitter
and he rose the level of mascot which is
the highest level of you know
but I'm going to defend him because I
like free speech
all right gonna defend them because I
like free speech
um
I don't disagree with it as a business
decision necessarily
not necessarily
but I'm I'm a little bit more flexible
than the rest of you because I am a
target of this kind of attack
and if you're a daily Target of that
kind of attack you know people
impersonating you and starting rumors
and stuff
I don't know I think you just gotta
accept that a little bit of that as part
of the job a little bit of it
I I would have preferred here's what I
prefer
I would prefer that musk suspended them
permanently like apparently happened
but then I would give them an amnesty
with the
um with a group that he's putting
together
so remember there even though they're
permanently suspended they now they now
join a group of people who have been
permanently suspended for years for all
kinds of different things now if if musk
is putting together this this Advisory
board or some kind of a Content group if
they're going to look at all of them
then I'm okay with that
then the suspension makes perfect sense
because it's the it's the that group
he's putting together who should decide
if you're not really suspended
you know it actually makes sense to me
that the first thing you do is follow
the terms of service exactly as they're
written
if you follow the terms of service
exactly as it written they're suspended
is very clear right the terms of service
say that unambiguously you're gone if
you impersonate somebody
but I feel like here's here's the
difference though
if a famous comedian
impersonates somebody on Twitter as an
obvious prank is that really the same
is it really
like I don't think it is I would like to
see the content moderation board or
whoever they are I'd like to see them re
um I'd like to see them reverse these
because what would be more useful than
making making a an example of them
but still in the unfavoring freedom
that's the ultimate solution the
ultimate solution is to completely ban
them as has happened
put them in the same process as all the
other people banned for other reasons
but I would bring them back because I
think the example is more important than
some you know technical terms of service
thing that got violated
what do you think of that what do you
think of bringing them back with some
other people who maybe were vile for
different reasons but just give
everybody one one grand amnesty you
don't have to do it a second time right
at the same time you bring them back you
could also say we're never going to do
this again
right you you can bring both Griffin and
Klein back and just say you know we we
want to use this to publicize the fact
that this is a zero going forward this
is zero flexibility
but we'll give you one grand amnesty
just to communicate just to communicate
our priorities
I think that would be a smart move
you know what's really dumb
giving Elon Musk business advice
I think the dumbest thing you can do in
public
isn't it it's sort of like you know
teaching Taylor Swift Out of Satan or
something you know let me tell Taylor
Swift how she should sing because I'm
basing this on my listening skills
based on my listening skills Taylor
Swift should make her music a little bit
different it would just sound ridiculous
but yet we all feel like we can you know
run Twitter better than somebody who you
know created Tesla and SpaceX
so a little bit of humility goes a long
way in these situations
I try as hard as I can to muster any
humility I can muster it's a lot of work
for me
I would like to yet again
praise CNN for successfully finding the
middle ground
and this is a way bigger deal than you
think right I've been I've been tracking
the trend to see if it's real it's real
I I now declare the CNN's leadership
meant what they said
they literally meant they're going to
try and Define the reasonable metal and
they've done it they've absolutely done
it because here we are the day before
the midterms and you look at their site
and they're they're they're thrashing
Democrats
the Democrats are totally being taken
out to the Woodshed by CNN the day
before the midterms
that's actually happening
and
how good is that for the country
it's really good
is really good for the country
so the things that CNN is saying is that
oh well and just a perfect example
during the Trump Administration how many
times did I tell you well uh Stefan
Collinson has written another anti-trump
article opinion piece for CNN and that I
would mock how ridiculously over the top
his criticism was because it was just
you know no attempt at fairness
whatsoever
well today again the day before the
midterms Stephen Collinson writes an
opinion piece
except instead of being the chief Trump
Basher and you could always throw Trump
into this right it'd be really easy to
make Trump the story the day before the
midterms you could do that easily
but he didn't
Stefan Collison has said said quote in
his piece here's where the Democrats are
he's quoting uh
Republican he's quoting Rona Rana orona
Rona right Rona McDaniel
and uh I guess Ronan McDaniel said quote
here's where the Democrats are their
inflation deniers they are crime deniers
and their education deniers okay now
it's one thing
it's one thing if you show that the
other side is trashing you
that's fair but it's not really as Fair
as you could be right
he goes further
and then quotes a Hillary Rosen a long
time Democrat supporter so now you're
going to have a republican opinion as
well as a Democrat opinion now that's
fair I sat on the same show that her
party had misjudged the mood of the
electorate
and says quote I'm a loyal Democrat but
I'm not happy I just think that we are
we did not listen to voters in this
election and I think we're going to have
a bad night
at McDowell oh McDaniel is Rona McDaniel
um
isn't that interesting
Stefan Collinson the main Trump Basher
quotes a prominent Republican and a
prominent Democrat saying that the
Democrats just totally
screwed the pooch
now this is actually too late
is that amazing
does that like blow your mind a little
bit
it does now they had here's something
that blew my mind like really hard last
night so I'm going through the channels
just go to the channels I have CNN and I
say to myself I think I'll I'll see how
long it takes before I
feel a sickness in my stomach
because you know what it feels like when
you watch CNN in the old days you turn
it on and you'd wait for somebody to say
something that just made you sick
because it was just a lie and it was
just propaganda
and it was just bad for the country and
you sit there you're like God
God and you'd have to turn it off
you couldn't even watch it for a minute
because it was so not news
so yesterday in the evening one of the
Prime Time Shows it's a group discussion
of a bunch of people you'd recognize
from CNN
and they're talking about Trump
and I turn it on like oh here it is oh
God it's going to be fine people hoax
and drink and bleach and yeah they're
racist this and the things he said and I
watched it for about 10 minutes
and they talked about how skilled Trump
was
without any hedging
[Laughter]
what
several of them talked about how skilled
he was that his persuasion his ability
to clear a field his ability to put a
hurt on a competitor his ability to take
out DeSantis you know she should not be
under estimated they they basically just
went skill Plus
now they did not agree with his politics
like his policies either not one way or
the other but that's what the news is
supposed to be
that's exactly what I want in my news
now they didn't give him a free pass
they didn't give Trump a free pass but
the few things they said they were a
little bit negative you would have
agreed with you probably would have said
yeah that's fair like just basic
ordinary stuff
they actually pulled it off with a group
panel
I can't tell you how big this is here's
why
as long as CNN supported the Democrats
no matter what they did
the Democrats could Gaslight the country
on absolutely anything anything
but as long as it's only MSNBC and some
you know still uh still crazy sites that
are going on about things as long as CNN
exists and actually gives you the actual
news and it appears that they can do it
it looks like they can actually pull
that off I was very skeptical
but congratulations they did it
they've changed everything
about two movies on one screen doesn't
work anymore
CNN was the key that unlocked the whole
two movie problem they just unlocked it
you you now have a place you can go to
and I hate that I'm giving a commercial
for CNN but I feel like I owe it to them
because I've been on them for
five years
have you not seen me just absolutely
just defecate on them every day for six
years or five years or whatever and they
deserved it yeah they deserved every bit
of that
and now that they're performing in a way
that I think is a service to the country
thank you I'm I'm actually grateful for
it so you get my full support if they
you know keep going the way they're
going
by the way there's still not as fun to
watch as Fox News
if I can be balanced here for a moment
Fox News is just better produced it has
better on-air on-air personalities I
won't say talent because they're Fox
News goes for a little more
entertainment slash news which is a real
good balance I think I have to balance
pretty well
yeah all right enough about that uh
Rasmussen has some last minute polling
before the midterms
um
and it says interesting that more
Democrats than Republicans or
unaffiliated voters have voted early
I was wondering if that would matter
does it matter
the more Democrats have voted early
because I don't think that will change
the fact that the overnight voting or
the next day voting
could you know change the results
so we're sort of back in that situation
aren't we all right here's my take on uh
election rigging
now I tweeted this but I've never said
it this clearly before you ready
both sides presumably now this is
speculation and assumption just being a
smart person who lives in the world and
knows how the world works okay
so I can't prove anything I'm about to
say
but I think it's just obvious this is
obvious it goes like this
neither the Democrats nor the
Republicans want to fix the transparency
of the voting system
would anybody agree disagree with that
do you disagree
anybody disagree
because there are states that the
Republicans control and there's there
are places where Democrats control
neither of them have done all
to make the election absolutely
bulletproof because they know how to do
it they know how to do it just do it
paper ballots keep them in one room
count them immediately in the same room
have multiple Witnesses
it's really that easy you know Israel
does it you could do it easily now don't
you think that if one party could do it
it would be like a real competitive like
Advantage you'd say hey
why can't you fix your elections in your
state you see that we've done it
wouldn't you suspect that the Democrats
were all cheating if the Republicans
could make all their elections
bulletproof and you could tell you just
look at them and go okay there's no way
you could cheat in that system just like
Israel right you look at the Israel
system you go uh yeah there really isn't
a way to cheat not with that much
transparency
so
clearly both sides want to cheat
in their own areas that they control
does anybody disagree with that
it's clear that both want to game the
rules
they want to game the the rules the
legal rules within the legal system
Democrats Did It Best in 2020 legally
they gamed the system but all legally
Democrats are trying to do the same
thing I suppose all legally
you know and then you've got all this
weird gerrymandering
it's all legal the gerrymandering is the
most up thing in the whole world
and it's completely legal right so you
have you have an election in which
rigging and
are accepted Parts by both parties
I'll call it the because some of
it is completely legal
and just clever
right and by some of it clearly is
clearly as illegal activity clearly but
I just don't know that any of it has
risen to a level of changing any
elections I don't know that's part I
don't know
so here's my take whatever the result is
I will accept them as quickly as I
accepted the Biden presidency which is
the moment it was called
as soon as Biden was called the winner I
congratulated the other team
and I never changed my mind
which is independent from the question
of whether any rigging happened
but do you know what my opinion is about
Biden's legitimacy
under the unproven speculative
assumption that the election was rigged
in my opinion he's absolutely completely
legitimate president
that's my view because we built a system
in which both sides are okay with
cheating
Am I Wrong both sides are okay with
cheating clearly because one side could
easily just make it on you know cheap
proof if neither does it if neither
makes it cheap proof it's obvious that
they both think they have an advantage
in their own their own little domain
that they control
right now uh
this is a
h
is that Elon Musk tweet to
independent-minded voters they're just
going to interrupt because I just saw
this shared power curbs the worst
excesses of both parties therefore I
recommend voting for a republican
Congress
given that the president is good Lord
did he actually say that
okay that's not cool
[Laughter]
you know honestly that's not cool
is that fake
Is that real can somebody
tell me if that's real
I
does that look real
read it again
so basically he's uh he's promoting
mixed government right he's just
promoting a mixed government now a lot
of people say that I just don't think he
should
I feel like his job as uh Chief Twitter
boss
I don't feel like he should say that the
day before the election do you
he has free speech so of course he can I
just feel like it wasn't the right play
for his business model
and the reason is that it says vote
Republican but it doesn't favor
Republicans but nobody's going to get
that Nuance right if you read
specifically what he said
he's in favor of a mixed government
but to get there if you have to vote
Republican to get there nobody's going
to take that as being balanced
that will not look balanced to anybody
on the left
I don't know
it was really
uh okay so let me finish my point
um
I assume that this election like all of
our prior elections will have some
 in it some legal
maybe some not I don't know how big I
don't know if it would change the result
but I'm going to accept the election
when it's called
and I'm not I won't ask you to do it so
I'm not trying to persuade you I'm just
telling you my thinking so that when you
see it you'll understand because
cheating is just built into the system
now and both sides have accepted it
that's my opinion cheating is built into
the system it's probably in the two
percent level
probably just in a few places maybe
those change the election
it might change the result I don't know
if we'll ever know if we never know
and elections are always close
oh you want to hear a really good
conspiracy theory
I don't know if you've ever heard this
one before because I just made it up so
maybe somebody had this one already so
this is just totally
fun speculation just total conspiracies
theory stuff okay just for fun
if you were the powers behind the
curtain just imagine that they exist and
you wanted to control the presidency
the best way you would do it
would you make sure that your candidate
had a landslide win
well if you could you'd probably do that
but suppose you you couldn't guarantee
that your team would have a landslide
win and you wanted to do it by cheating
the first thing you'd have to do is
manipulate the country until the
election was so close
that the two percent or so you could
manipulate by cheating would actually
make a difference
do you find it suspicious that our
elections are always so close
does that coincidence some
that does that seem weird to you
how in the world could they always be so
close
really let me let me toss you a really
on this one
every year our highly divided country
is split right down the middle
basically right down the middle to a to
a statistical
tie right if it if it were poll numbers
instead of an actual election
wouldn't be a statistical tie or very
close
now what are the odds that that happens
year after year
just for the presidency
right this doesn't happen for the lower
races right all of the lower races are
are a mixed bag or they follow the
population right if it's a debt if it's
a Democrat area the Democrat wins of
course but why is it
why is it that no matter what happens
the presidencies like within that margin
of error a few points situation
doesn't that feel like the powers that
be have to manipulate things to be a
look like a tie so that no matter which
way it goes the public isn't surprised
right
no matter which way this election goes
let's say the next election for
President no matter which way the
presidency goes
you won't be surprised
you know people are going to claim fraud
if their team doesn't win but you won't
be surprised no matter which way it goes
right am I right
nothing would surprise you because it's
ever it's always manipulated to be even
now do you think that the that any
powers that be do you think that's
possible
do you think it's possible
to control enough of the media and
enough of the argument enough of the
press and enough of the polling you'd
have to control the polling as well do
you think they could control enough of
that to guarantee that the elections are
always neck and neck
well let me ask you this
what would be one way to test
uh test the theory
here's how you could test it you could
you could find an election in which you
had one strong candidate
and one there was obviously just a
and that's what the Biden versus uh
Trump election was
it was that was it that was your test
case they they wrote they ran a
successful strong sitting president
against the
if that's not telling you that the
system is rigged
what's it take
let me test your yours just a
little mental test for you
do you think that you could run John
fetterman let's say fetterman loses the
Senate I don't know if he will let's say
he does you don't think that the
Democrats could run John fetterman in
his current health
against a perfectly healthy Trump and it
would be uh neck and neck
okay that's not a pun when I said neck
and neck fill in your own jokes you
jerks
you jerks
am I right I'll bet you they could run
fetterman and it would be at the on the
election day you wouldn't know who was
going to win
right
do you need any more evidence
that there's no democracy going on here
I don't know exactly what's going on but
it's nothing like a democracy where
people are voting and paying their best
person and that what it looks like is a
system where we're manipulated into a
tie and then somebody behind the curtain
decides who wins and then we go damn we
were so close this time so close
now I'm not saying that's what's
happening
I'm saying it looks exactly like it and
I don't have another explanation for why
we could have this coincidence time
after time and that even Biden could get
elected even Biden I mean really really
you know in in hindsight they will just
look ridiculous
I think we we got used to any level of
craziness because you're living in it
you know you can get used to anything
but as soon as there's a little distance
and we look back and we see that Biden
was elected when we knew exactly what we
were getting everybody knew there was no
mystery there
all right
[Applause]
um
so musk said that he's going to monetize
all all the content
not tweets themselves but you'll
monetize content on Twitter
and there were some amazing exchanges of
you know somebody informing him how much
they made on YouTube
and somebody made the claim I don't know
if this is true but I just saw it on
Twitter that YouTube gives creators 55
of AD Revenue
is that right
is that right
does anybody know
I'm actually I actually get revenue from
YouTube
and I don't know
you think so
I don't know
um I know locals is uh you know much
higher percentage to the creators but
that's a subscription model so that
makes sense
um
so musk says uh we can beat that
so musk could compete with YouTube on
percentage to the content creators to
which I say to myself
you have my interest
is there any reason that you couldn't
imagine 100 of All Digital content being
released on Twitter alone
that's easy to imagine isn't it
can't you imagine that even a streaming
movie would just be released on Twitter
you know maybe you don't even need your
own streaming service
do you
yeah now I don't think they have the uh
the back end to do that yet
but it's all doable I mean they would
know how they've got the financial
backing to do it they can do it
yeah
so the the competition now for uh
content on social media just got
interesting because YouTube was close to
the only game in town even though Rumble
is a serious competitor now
but still you had to do YouTube at the
same time didn't you I've seen a few
people are using YouTube just as the
advertisement for rumble you know
they'll do a teaser I think
um
a few people do that now right
all right
um
so that would be interesting it's easy
to imagine that Twitter could be the
place that you get all digital content
everything from books to
um Comics all right let me ask you this
suppose I said I will take Dilbert out
of all newspapers
and the only place you could ever read
it would be on Twitter but
you know I'd have to give some kind of
you know content Revenue sharing deal
with Twitter to do that
what about that
because I would actually be open to that
that's a possibility
is just take uh take it completely out
of newspapers and only put it in one
place
because because here's the thing
newspapers even though my income is uh
you know unusually high for the job I
have
newspapers individually don't pay very
much so one newspaper might pay you know
15 a week for Dilbert so it's basically
nothing
uh so you need lots of thousands of
newspapers but if you had just one one
entity
like Twitter
you wouldn't need you know I've got
three quarters of a million followers on
Twitter
if a hundred thousand of them you know
wanted to pay a dollar
a month for whatever I'm doing
suddenly that adds up pretty quickly I
mean it's over a million pretty pretty
quickly so
I think he's got something here I think
that the content the revenue from
content
if if Twitter becomes competitive with
the other places you can release content
and it could there's nothing that would
stop it
I don't know it's a real strong play I
the the thing that
um that caught my eye was when musk
talked about the potential for Twitter
he said he actually said his odds of
making it work were low
did you hear that he actually said it's
pretty low the odds of making us
successful he meaning financially
successful but he also said it has the
potential to be one of the most valuable
companies on the planet
do you buy both of those statements I do
it definitely has the potential to be
one of the most valuable products on the
planet or companies and I also think the
odds are against him but do you remember
what he said about both Tesla and SpaceX
he started both Tesla and SpaceX with
the assumption that the odds were away
against him and he wouldn't work
they put everything in he went all in on
Tesla assuming it wouldn't work
and then it did and they did the same
thing with SpaceX it went all in
assuming it probably wouldn't work
but it did and now he's saying the same
thing about Twitter there's literally
nothing more optimistic you could ever
hear about Twitter then Elon Musk saying
I don't think it's going to work but I'm
all in
what would make you happier than that
the odds are way against me but I'm all
in
that's what gave you Tesla in SpaceX
you know that's what gave you those
things
so I I love his I just love everything
he's doing over there even when I don't
like it I love it you know what I mean
like the whole show is just magic it's
just a great time to be alive if
especially if you're a business model
nerd like I am I just love watching him
try to develop a business model that
works
all right
um Twitter even fact check Biden's lie
about uh gas prices so Twitter added uh
to Biden's tweet
a context note automatically well
there's probably some person involved
but it's uh connected now so Biden said
that when he got elected the most common
gas price was blah blah or no he said
Biden said the most common gas price now
is three dollars something
and then people said you liar but
apparently it's uh it's more of a weasel
trick than a lie because by saying most
common he wasn't saying average
if he had said average it would have
been fact checked as completely wrong
but apparently most common is actually
true
and that's actually not a bad claim is
it
if he were if he were a little more
clear about it yes the mode is the mode
not the average if he had been a little
more clear about it say yeah the average
is still high but the most common price
is in this three dollars that would have
been a strong point
that would have been a strong point
but instead he had to make his own
weasily and light and then Twitter
called The Man
so I like that part
um
how uh let's talk one more thing about
politics and I'll make you all mad later
um
Bill Maher
was saying that uh
you know he was sort of shocked and
amazed that the Republicans Now by his
by his version of things
Bill Maher says that Trump insulted
um Hispanics and then got elected and
got more Hispanic votes than Republicans
had and then four more years of
insulting Hispanics according to Bill
Maher uh and that he and and his
Hispanic vote went up to like you know
unexpected levels
and here's what uh
um
Bill Maher characterizes that as he goes
um he's saying the immigration isn't
working the way Democrats wanted it and
he said uh
uh Mark continued and said that
immigrants are quote sort of natural
conservatives
the immigrants are sort of natural
conservatives
who is the first person you heard tell
you that
who's the first person you ever heard
tell you that they're natural
conservatives
now I assume other people have noticed
it but the first time I ever heard it it
came out of my mouth
I never heard it from did Rush Limbaugh
said that now if somebody else said it
oh if Grandma said he said it before I
did yeah so I was trying to figure out
how many people said it before I did and
if crowd Heimer said it then he beat me
by a lot
but you can't live in the community
all right let me
let me show you a proof
I'm going to show you a video
uh if I can find it and it's gonna
all right I I think you can see this
well say can you see this
do you see this crew of workers uh now
one assumes that they uh probably had an
Hispanic
that they're Hispanic came from
somewhere South of the Border probably
not that long ago let me show it to you
again
all right here's what you need to know
number one this is Saturday
this is Saturday
so the Immigrant population almost all
works six or seven days a week that's
the first thing you need to know
secondly watch them happily tossing
these concrete bricks
in this line the part you can't see is
that they're laughing and having a good
time
working on a Saturday the the guys in
the middle don't even have work gloves
on they're using their bare hands to
throw concrete
and laughing and having a good time on a
Saturday
now here's my question to you
do you want more of these people in your
country I'm saying these people who are
doing this specific thing do you want
more of them or few of them
let me tell you the answer you want more
of them you want more of these do they
look like Democrats do you
no they're not no and when they're done
you know they go pray and they go to
church and they take care of their
family and family is the most important
thing they call about work it's
basically work
family God
you don't want more of them
all right
um so that was just something I noticed
as I was walking through the
neighborhood and I thought you know
people need to see the other side of
this because you know you all of the uh
and by the way let me be clear I'm a
maniac about border control
I want complete border control
I just think we should be smart about
when we open the door and how much right
a separate question
all right
um
question
do you think that Moscow is going to
lose power this winter
now you're probably going to say no
and there might be some physical
limitation for Ukraine beagle to launch
an attack on Moscow
but I I checked into moscow's energy
situation and they get 46 of their
energy from gas
right now how many gas plants
do you think that means like actual
physical
facilities
several because Moscow is pretty big so
maybe three
yeah if you had to guess without knowing
anything about anything I'd say maybe
three
somebody says 53 it wouldn't be a lot
but I think it'd be closer to three
choke points do you think the Ukraine
has a physical ability not talking about
the strategy or the will do they have
the physical ability to take out three
uh gas plants that serve Moscow
what do you think
I think yes
but it would probably have to be suicide
attacks
right
I say yes probably suicide attacks so if
you look at a map Moscow is not so far
from Ukraine that you can't imagine it
right if Moscow had been on the other
side of urasha then yeah it's just maybe
too hard but it looks like they're
within attack distance for a drone or a
missile or or a suicide jet
suicide bombing now I don't believe
Moscow will be necessarily attacked
but here's what I would do if I were
zelenski
if I was zelenski I would say to Russia
um if you continue to turn off our
lights and we don't have power this
winter we're going to turn off the
lights in Moscow
now just just game it through we're
going to turn off the lights in Moscow
now you live in Moscow what are you
going to do
you might leave
you might leave
if if you can get Moscow to mobilize
to leave
you don't have to bomb them
because all you want to do is get the
message to Moscow that they don't have
security of electricity anymore just the
message you don't actually have to bomb
anybody
if I was zielinski I would say in
January the lights are going off in
Moscow
if you keep it up
now they don't have to do it
but I would sure make sure that Putin
knew that the lights might go out in
Moscow in January because I think they
could get that done now it might be a
terrible idea because it might you know
maybe that would trigger a nuclear
response or something so the actual the
doing of it is a separate decision
but the threatening of it I can't see
that as a bad decision do you
don't you think you should threaten it
because I think you need to put the
Russian citizens on notice that this
isn't free
you know that they can win their War
they can do what they want but it's not
going to be free
you know you could have to put some skin
in the game musk mus muscovites
all right now I don't want to see Moscow
attacked I don't want to see any
civilians killed but if I were running
the war in Ukraine I would definitely
put that thought in their head
do you think uh Trump would
I think Trump would
Trump would definitely put the thought
in in Russia's head
I don't think he would attack Russia but
he'd be smart enough to make him think
about it
don't you think that's the right play
make him think about it
because remember the war is being fought
physically but it's also being fought
inside the brain of every person
involved
and you could win the brain fight
but you've got to put some risk on the
Russian people that they can feel
that you know has an actual visual
visceral feel to them and and turning
out the lights in Moscow in the winter
sounds like a pretty scary thing
apparently Ukraine got some air defense
stuff delivered finally some nassams
some kind of surface-to-air missile kind
of thing
how good do you think they are
because I don't know I know in Israel
they don't get them all right Israel
would probably have the world's best air
defense I think
for small rocket attacks
but how many what percentage of rockets
does Israel take down
what percent
of the ones fired into Israel what
percent do they get
now it could be that they don't try to
get them all
somebody I don't think it's more than 50
50 is it somebody says 95 that doesn't
sound right I think it's somewhere
between 50 and
65.
something like that but they also don't
need to
um
they also don't need to
sorry I was just looking at a comment
about my town
all right
it's pretty high
um this will be the first time we ever
get to see what our best weapons can do
against serious weapons now let me ask
this with pure ignorance there might be
somebody who can answer this the
missiles that the Palestinians are
lobbying into Israel
are
closer to like smaller
you know almost homemade kind of stuff
right
that it's not like high-end drones or
anything am I right
whereas Ukraine is being attacked by
high-end drones and high-end missiles
is the anti-aircraft oh the is it scuds
they're sending in from the Palestinian
regions I don't know uh so here's my
question can the anti-aircraft have a
better record against high-end equipment
than low end equipment go because the
low end bombs they might not even try to
shoot them all down because they're so
inaccurate maybe you're better off just
letting them land in the desert
uh one base in Iraq our defense was
greater than 90 percent
yeah it's it really is the ultimate test
bed is it so where I was going with this
is this will be the first time maybe
it might be the first time we find out
how good our anti-aircraft is against
modern weapons because if they can only
take out the modern stuff you know the
the high-end drones and the high-end
missiles if that's all they take out
um
hmm
so
uh
interesting so both sides try to hide
their good stuff so that's part of the
story it could be that Russia is not
showing its best weapons
for strategic reasons and it could be
that we didn't send our best
anti-aircraft weapons
so both of those could be true
but we'll find out
all right
there was a see that a story about a
Iowa team
who killed her alleged rapist and then
was sentenced to uh she got
sentenced to probation and she escaped
from probation
so that's the update as she escaped she
got her ankle bracelet off and somehow
she escaped from probation so she wasn't
in jail jail but she had an ankle brace
alone
now the story when you look into the
story apparently this girl had been
abused by a number of adults when she
was a teenager in the worst possible
ways whatever you think is the worst
thing that could happen it was that
and then the one she killed which she
admits killing with a knife uh allegedly
would uh drug her into unconsciousness
and rape her repeatedly
and she wouldn't know until she woke up
and found out she was in the middle of
getting raped
now one of those days the rapist himself
fell fell asleep
and she noticed the rapist was asleep
and his knife which presumably he used
to scare her when he raped her or
whatever but there was a there was a
knife in the room and so she took the
knife and she stabbed to death the
sleeping rapist
and she got convicted
and then she escaped
is there any way we could give her some
kind of national award
because I feel like this is a you know
like I I like to vote for her for a
Senator of Pennsylvania
right can we can we find this woman and
give her the credit she deserves this is
a toughest woman I've ever heard
in my life
yeah she just she just went through hell
murdered a guy and then escaped from the
escape from the system I love her
I love her
and let me and let me offer this as well
if you can't murder your sleeping rapist
I don't want to live in this country
murdering your sleeping races rapists
should be an award not jail sentence I
don't care how premeditated it is I
don't care if he raped you
five years ago
if you can find that asleep
and put a knife through his throat
I'm with you you you have my full
support murder that
murder him in his sleep I'm all good
with that
but the system doesn't like murder
our system doesn't like to encourage
premeditated murder
uh but still
if ever there was anybody who deserved
to to get a full pardon
is this this woman
this woman needs a full pardon
so please give a real full pardon
um
you know I you know I didn't mention
this in the story but I wonder if the
fact that she's a black woman has
anything to do with the story
do you think a white woman would have
been treated the same
you have to ask the question right
kind of have to ask the question
no
this is what this one's so sketchy that
I have to ask that question
um
so let's talk about marriage
Dave I see my uh
tweets about marriage
all right
now the NPC comment
I like to do it for you for the NPCs uh
what you can for you to participate in
this conversation I would like you to
note that I've been divorced twice
that would be the NPC comment now what
you don't know is that agrees with my
point
right had I been happily married
the point wouldn't make sense
so I found the only way I can make my
critics agree with me enthusiastically
is by saying that marriage you know has
issues and then they say well well you
got divorced twice why are we listening
to you to which I say
I'm experienced
why would you listen to someone who was
inexperienced
no so NPCs feel free to jump in and
criticize me for my for my marriage
choices
um that's fair game today all right
um what's driving me crazy is that I've
been spending too much time on Instagram
and I think because of the algorithm
it's feeding me more of stuff I've paid
attention to and I mean uh inundated
with bad relationship advice people
it seems to be people in a certain age
who are giving the worst advice
I've ever heard and they all have that
um smart sounding approach
do you know what I'm talking about how
many times have you seen the video the
little video pops up and you'll see it's
usually a man sometimes a woman and
they'll have that authoritative voice
and you're like yeah this person knows
what works and what doesn't but then you
think about it later and the only thing
they had was the authoritative voice it
was just bad bad advice
let me give you the worst advice that
anybody ever gave
and most of you have given me this
advice
marriage works
if you wait for the right person
do I have to say anything about that
marriage works great if you wait for the
right person
number one
who the says you're the right
person
you need two right people
one right person doesn't get it done you
did too
and what makes the other person right
well being right just means they they
fit with you there's no such thing as
just being right
there's being right for another person
that's the thing you could be right for
the person but you're not right right if
you wait for the right person that's the
end of civilization
you can't even have you couldn't even
have Humanity you couldn't have
reproduction it would all be over
our entire system depends on stupidity
it's a it's an evolved stupidity
so that because your dick is hard you
can't think anymore and you're like well
think about love yeah I'm simplifying
but that's the basic idea
so people have to be hypnotized
hypnotized usually by sex into thinking
this will last forever and then that
lasts long enough to make children
and then Evolution doesn't care what
happens to you after that
after you reproduce evolution is done
with you your life is
useless after that point
useless
after you reproduce
you have no use whatsoever to the
long-term you know Civilization now now
in a perfect world The the elders
support everybody and you know I try to
do that as well but evolution isn't your
friend here right
here's here's the basic problem with
marriage
before marriage
correct me if I'm wrong you are in uh
enticement mode you're enticing the
other person and you're generally both
in that mode or else it would already be
over because it's so easy to walk away
from somebody who's not enticing you
so you're in enticement mode so you know
uh the the dating and the pre-marriage
go great as soon as you get married
it's hard to get unmarried like there's
a lot of friction and that's intentional
we build the friction in because we
think it's better
now once that happens what happens to
the balance of power
when is two people enticing each other
the balance of power is I'd say pretty
even wouldn't you
when you generally say the balance of
power is even because both have to bring
their game and if they don't it falls
apart
so once you're married what happens to
the balance of power
completely changes
right because the man doesn't want to
get divorced
just because the woman is a that
day
do you know why
because the man says we'll be better
tomorrow
this is like a temporary thing this
little thing that made my spouse mad at
me this isn't going to last this is just
today
so
next day
it's a new thing next day it's a new
thing and eventually you learned that
the woman is responding to incentives
there's nothing wrong with the woman in
this example the woman is acting exactly
like anybody would
once you're out of enticement mode
that's your your incentive your
incentive system says show your best
side and entice as soon as you marry
that incentive system disappears because
you're going to stay together just
because it's hard to leave you're
committed
so now
the woman changes her strategy but she
changes it wisely
and rationally
and the most rational thing for a woman
to do in marriage
is to make the husband
perpetually unhappy
but also under the illusion that if you
waste a little bit or he does something
different it could be better
so the woman realizes she can completely
manipulate the man
by being unhappy
and she just continues to say what she's
unhappy about and the husband keeps
saying okay that's not a big deal what
you're asking for is reasonable I will
do that and then I've solved my problems
forever
until tomorrow
and then it's a new problem huh what a
coincidence well just bad luck two
problems in two days third day well
that's weird three problems in three
days I didn't see that coming fourth day
fifth day sixth day no
the the wife has to put pain into the
husband's life or he won't do a
thing that you want
do you know why because he doesn't have
the incentive
so the woman is going to withdraw sax
withdraw attention you know withdraw
everything she has to until the man is
suffering enough that he'll do whatever
the she wants because he doesn't
want to leave
here's another Truth for you
who keeps who keeps agreements better
men or women
go who keeps agreements better men or
women in general this doesn't mean every
person right none of this means every
person everybody's into it it's men it's
men why why do men keep agreements and
women don't
again that's a generalization there are
plenty of women who keep agreements
why
no it's not character that's such an
 answer it's not character
it's incentive it's incentive everybody
acts on incentive
the you know whoever said like men are
awesome or something I'm not saying men
are better than women character-wise no
there's no evidence of that I'm saying
that
they have different incentives
that's all
all right
um
I also think that the system is ruined
by the 20 of people who get married and
it totally works for them
that's my own estimate but in my opinion
about 20 percent of marriages really
they kind of nailed it they might have
got lucky maybe it was two functional
people who were just in the right place
and had you know the same goals in life
maybe got married early because that
could help
you know had kids shared a thing
so in my opinion something like 20
percent of marriages work perfectly and
then what did the 20 tell you
what did the 20 tell you about your
marriages your marriage potential do you
know what the 20 tell you
it's easy just do what we did we treat
each other well we respect each other we
have different roles right
is that good advice is it good advice
that you should try acting like the 20
who made it work
no that's the most up advice
anybody ever gave you it's purely
corrosive that is toxic advice
you need a system that works the system
is what doesn't work it's marriage it's
like imagining that you can live with
another person
in a world in which all the incentives
are maybe you shouldn't the incentives
are moving further and further away from
Marriage making sense
and so you get exactly what the
incentives are giving you right follow
the money
if a woman couldn't get divorced because
she couldn't live any other you know not
being married then probably would have
happened
now I don't think you should make it
harder to get divorced I'm just saying
that's what would happen if you make it
easy to get divorced and women have jobs
that make as much money as men you know
getting closer and closer to that
there's not really a strong thing
keeping you married if you're a woman
because you can get the kids
and some money
and a new guy
it's not a bad deal and if you get a new
guy
you get to share your kids and now the
new guy gets to have you 50 of the time
without kids in the house
here's something that um
was a mystery to me when I was married
I wondered why uh I never felt in the
mood for sex when kids were in the house
and then I found out it's actually a
thing did you know that if you spend
time around kids your your testosterone
just drops to the floor
that's a real thing
so if you're the second marriage
at least the kids are going half of the
time if they're half the time with the
other so at least half of the time you
have some chance of like a normal
relationshipy thing than the other half
man
yeah
um
so and then the other factor which
cannot be uh discounted I'm seeing a lot
of noise on social media about porn
destroying people we'll talk about that
in a moment but what is definitely true
is that the quality of porn has gone you
know has improved every year we'll talk
more about that whereas the quality of
people has decreased
right the quality of people has
decreased because we all have such
different preferences now the finding
another person who wants to do what you
want to do at the same time is
practically impossible whereas it used
to be easy
in the old days you'd be like what do
you want to do well there's three three
channels on TV there's only one good
show let's watch it
boom you're both happy
but now you can't get two people to
watch the same show do the same thing at
the same time nobody wants to do
anything at the same time
so people
by improving individually you know being
more complete people individually are
less less needy of each other and you
know they don't need the others money
you know a woman can hire somebody to
lift heavy objects you just don't need
each other in the way we used to so
relationships are getting worse
but porn can find out exactly what you
like it's no longer generic I mean a lot
of it is generic but if you wanted to
watch porn you could find you know
left-handed redheads
who like beach balls
and that's your exact thing and you can
find it not that actually but things
so the difference between what porn used
to be sort of a generic thing that
everybody liked a bit to something that
hits your exact button
it's a 10 times difference in
Effectiveness right I'm not talking
about you know it's 20 percent better
because I got the exact thing I wanted
no it's not 20 better it's ten times
better it's not even close
right now that's this is before VR
imagine virtual reality and AI
thrown into this mix because it will be
human relationships are really in
trouble
really try and so is actually
reproduction it's really in trouble now
that doesn't mean we won't fix it
because we're good at fixing long-term
problems we'll work it out I just don't
know where it'll go it's going to go
somewhere weird
but here are the
um here are the things
I spent 10 minutes looking important and
I learned a lot I've told you that I've
admitted I've looked at porn for you
know 10 minutes that one time
so much you can learn in 10 minutes it's
true now here's the second question does
porn ruin your brain I'm seeing that on
social media does it make you um
you know less less valuable to women
yeah it does of course of course it does
how could it not
because if if women have competition
yeah I mean that's a problem right
and the competition is getting better
and better
every day so that that is a problem but
do you think it gives you brain damage
well suppose suppose it's true
that what women are noticing
is that men are different if they're
watching a lot of porn and that the way
they're different is that they don't
show as much attraction to the women
suppose that's that's how they're brain
damaged the brain damage is the man is
less attracted to the women and
therefore doesn't date and stuff like
that is that brain damage
is that brain damage or is that just
somebody who found an alternative and
liked it
I don't know
yeah it kind of uh it's a brain
difference I guess you'd have to ask
what is damage and what is just
different
it's different
yeah
yeah and porn is definitely uh ruining
our expectations isn't it
I don't know if how many of you are
young enough to have experienced the uh
the partner who learned how to have sex
from watching porn
like if you've experienced that it's
different
yeah it's different
definitely different
all right so here's what I think
I think if porn is ruining your life
maybe you're not good at it
doesn't every skill have a uh have a
normal curve where somebody or some
people are just average at it some
people are bad at it and some people are
great at it
this is what nobody wants to say out
loud right do you think that everybody
masturbates with the same skill
not even that's not even slightly
possible it is not possible whoever is
the best at it
is not having the same experience as
somebody who's just you know trying it
out for the first time it's like every
other thing the people who are good at
it are probably really good at it and
you have no idea what that looks like
like if you're not good at it you're
imagining that your experience is like
theirs
yeah it's
so I would say that masturbation is like
firearms
Firearms are not good or bad
it just depends what you're doing with
it
right just depends what you're doing
with it
if your spouse is away on a business
trip for a week are you going to get
brain damage for taking care of yourself
during the week I don't think so I think
I think that would be a perfectly
legitimate use
of a tool so to speak right
yeah I don't think I could turn this
into a micro lesson but uh
so
waiting for the right person is
definitely a strategy that can't work
for Humanity
and those people who who tell us that
they waited for the right person and did
it just ignore them so here's my overall
point of view
My overall point of view
is you can't listen to the 20 of married
people who made it work
do you know what
here oh I really with you
if you took those two people who made
their marriage work and you took one of
them it doesn't matter which one it
could be the husband or the wife just
pick one of them and then you marry that
person
do you think it would work
probably
because it's the person right
if you marry somebody who's just
a great person
you've probably become a better person
you know unless you're an awful person
to yourself
I believe that when a marriage works
it's because one of them is awesome
that's what I think that one of them is
unusually awesome
I think that's why a marriage works and
that's maybe 20 of the population
now if you get two awesome people to
marry each other
ideal I just don't think the odds are
very good for that happening I think one
awesome person can bring another one
along
you know maybe maybe up the average of
the other person because they they try
to raise to the level
let me give you an actual example I
won't say who told me this but years ago
um somebody said they were becoming a
vegetarian
and the reason was that his wife had
become a vegetarian but had also done a
number of other High character things
and and he felt like he wasn't competing
with her because her character
was so impressive
that he felt like like he wasn't doing
his share and I actually watched a man
change his behavior to try to lift it
explicitly like explicitly to lift his
character to the level of his spouse
that's the thing
that's the thing now I don't know if
there's any gender difference I think it
probably works both ways but I think
that one awesome person can make a
marriage work if they get you know
somebody who they can work with it's not
every person
but I think it's something like that
that's what's happening now everybody
who thinks that if all you did was the
two of you learned better technique you
could stay married what do you think of
that
if you learn better technique like how
to be a good partner that would that
would fix the two of you up
no that that is a
that is 80 illusion
I do P I do think that some people maybe
20 they can find something to tweak and
make it work but by far that's an
exception yeah it's more people don't
change that much right they can try
they don't change that much
all right
so uh Jack Dorsey was just fact checked
on Twitter did that happen
uh these tracking additions to a tweet
oh so I don't see Jack's tweet but
somebody said Jack Dorsey actually got a
factor fact checked on the fact check is
just that uh the changes were added a
while ago so I don't know what the
actual
claim was and I don't know if the fact
check is right or if Jack was right
I just know what happened
all right um
then I also saw a number of people on
Twitter when I complained about marriage
I'll see one person say well Scott you
know I feel sorry for you but my
marriage has worked great for 30 years
do you think they're having sex
I I feel like there are lots of
situations where one of the people will
say my marriage is great
and the other will say no I've just
decided to live with it
but I'll tell you it's great because I
want to live with it
yeah I I think there are some cases they
might be lying and in some cases the
spouse hasn't been laid in 20 years and
it's just learned not to complain
or is having an affair
so I might be a little cynical Maybe
Maybe
all right ladies and gentlemen we're
getting ready for the midterms enough
about that
um your comments were very interesting
to me on this topic
somebody says it beats loneliness
here's my approach to relationships and
marriage this will be my final word
they pretty much all go wrong
80 percent
do it anyway
do it anyway
I don't regret either in my marriages
I don't regret them a bit
could anybody else say that that they
got married it didn't work out they got
divorced but they don't regret it does
anybody else agree with that
see we live in a world where everything
ends badly
yeah and that's like I I always like to
keep that frame in my mind
everything ends badly
every company eventually goes out of
business
every human eventually dies
right it all ends badly there you know
you get sick
you know it's gonna happen no nobody has
no health problems right
so there's a little bit of the Buddhist
in me that says that that the pain is
part of the life
if you're if what you're trying to do is
avoid all your pain do not get married
if that's your weird idea of life is
avoiding all pain don't get married
that's not going to work out for you but
if you can embrace
embrace the end as well as you can
embrace the beginning
is awesome the end is terrible if you
can embrace them as a package
good try it out it's going to be tough
marriage is tough even if it works right
there's no easy ones but if you get a
kid out of it you know you get an
experience out of it you you learn
something out of it
I think it's worthwhile
I think there's a lot that should be
changed in terms of you know
the structure of it but but I think it's
it's still a crazy thing
this recommendable
it's a crazy irrational thing you should
do anyway to be a human being
yeah and continuing children probably is
the thing that will feel the best to you
in the long run I haven't done it myself
now have you noticed that people like me
who don't have biological children
sometimes I tend to think everybody is
your children
I think it could go either direction
you'd either go total hermit and you
know self-interest or you could get I
see I believe I have
um an evolutionary instinct
to help the species
it's just that my my calling and my
timing didn't involve natural children
um and so when I do things which are
designed to help the species which is
mostly what I do here I'm trying to help
the species
I I feel connected to the um
the entire Humanity cycle
even though I don't have biological
children
Sue says Scott sounds like a controlling
type
true
I don't know I don't know where that
came from but let me ask you how many of
you think I make controlling type
I say true do you know why
because everybody is everybody is
there are no non-controlling types
people just do it differently
some people are more effective some of
some people are more overt some people
are more transparent about it but we're
all trying to get what we want if you're
not you're doing it wrong
like yeah sometimes you might do it by
acting like a victim but you're still
trying to guess something
so who's controlling everybody
everybody's controlling all the time
it's a it's a sort of a an empty comment
it's like air air exists
have I sent my DNA to ancestry no but
I've sent it 23andMe has it
um
let me just look at your comments for a
moment
somebody says Jesus remains single but
he also knew why he was here
so what would Jesus do
same thing as me apparently until I get
crucified
I think that's going to happen any day
um
no somebody somebody's saying that Elon
Musk might have heard something from me
I guess Elon said quote hardcore
Democrats or Republicans never vote for
the other side so independent voters are
the only ones who actually decide who's
in charge that didn't come from me
that's that's a pretty generic political
comment
uh I've also said it but maybe you heard
it from from me but that's a general
common knowledge yeah
I would love to take credit for that you
know what's weird people give me credit
for things I never did like all day long
I get credit for saying things or doing
things that I didn't do as far as I know
but I also get blamed for things I
didn't do
it's the strangest thing about you know
being in the public eye
is is that all day long I'm fending off
uh rumors about things that I did that
were bad that I didn't do
at the same time people are giving me
credit for things I totally didn't do
totally did
but I don't know if it all works out
that's fine
uh just like being buried
um in the positive sense you have
wingmen yes I guess I do
I think we all do I would like to uh
add to a comment that
Balaji srinivasan said in an interview
on a podcast lately
I think it was Lex Friedman's podcast
but uh Balaji was talking about the
internet informing let's say interest
groups of various types and that that
would be a bigger thing going forward
and I think that's what we've done more
mostly the people who subscribe on
locals but we've created a an
organization
without being an organization is sort of
an interest you know common interest
group
but I think because my emphasis at least
on locals is teaching useful things that
could improve your life
uh but the locals grout has returned to
me a whole bunch of things including
like Health Care I've had health
problems diagnosed by my my locals
Community successfully uh
recommendations on this or that
Corrections on facts
um they've they've they knew things that
I didn't even know how to research
and so if you look at the mutual
interest group that has been created by
the locals community
I think this is the future
it is the future I'm going to credit the
locals Community for almost keeping me
alive
because you know I've talked about it
too much but when I was on some meds
that were making me suicidal
I feel like the only thing that kept me
alive is the live streaming because I
would get this positive interaction with
Humanity every day and
it's probably the only thing I enjoyed
during for months
so the when I look at the the mutual
benefit
of just having a group of people
who simply decided they wanted to be on
the same team
you know they just said oh I like being
on this team I get some benefits I'll
give them some benefits as well
so
I think this could be extended
you know I've actually considered this I
don't think I have enough subscribers to
do this I've got about 6 000 or so but
suppose I had a hundred thousand
subscribers
if I had a hundred thousand subscribers
I could go to the phone companies and
say whoever gives us all the discount
you can have all a hundred thousand or
at least I'll recommend it
right imagine how much economic clout
you could have you could buy insurance
as a group discount right yeah you could
actually coordinate
and not not even officially you could
just have any member of the group
any member of the group could just say
hey I just contacted this company and if
we recommend it within the group and
guess so many we'll get this discount or
something
right so so you could create a whole
bunch of
just benefits within a group simply
because you wanted to
is a whole new model because prior to
this
you sort of were on the team of your
let's say politics or the team of your
country you know maybe your town those
are all good things
but you never really created an
organization just dedicated to improving
each other
and that's some somewhat accidentally
that well on on yeah on YouTube I have
over a hundred thousand subscribers but
on locals six thousand or so
now if the locals group is bigger the
subscribers on YouTube Don't that
doesn't mean much it just means they get
an alert it doesn't really have much
meaning
yeah
yeah and you can imagine a an informal
group of people who are just dedicated
to their Mutual benefit you can imagine
them having a political clout after a
while
you don't think that if I got to a
million people
in a mutual interest group who really
literally just existed
to get smarter and happier and more
effective that's the only reason they
were together nothing else they just
wanted some entertainment and to become
better people
if I got to a million of those
you don't think we could decide to move
politics any way we want it I'll bet we
could
yeah
now I I sometimes get accused of
starting a cult
but uh I would like to embrace and
amplify that
denying it is a waste of time I'm going
to embrace and amplify it it is a cult
it is occult but it's a cult in which
your total costs are are expressed as
five dollars a month if you buy an
annual subscription
I have the most cost effective Cult of
all cults
so no I'm not going to deny I'm a cult
I'm going to say it's the best call
you've ever been in
five dollars a month and I I absolutely
will give you more than five dollars a
benefit
what live streaming gives you
um let's see
probably 45 hours of commercial free
content a month
wait is that right yeah because I'm like
an hour to an hour and a half per day of
free content which is designed to make
you smarter and more effective every day
that's not worth five dollars a month is
seven if you don't have the annual
subscription
yeah so if I'm a cult
I I'm a cult in which you can wear
whatever you want
say whatever you want do whatever you
want talk to anybody you want
you'll never you'll never be discouraged
from talking to other people
that's like the worst thing I called us
they try to get you not to talk to other
people no I'm the opposite talk to
everybody
you know look at the other news
so yes I I'm a cult
dedicated to all of us having a better
time
whatever that whatever whatever that
looks like
you do not have to end your life to
follow a comment I'll never ask you that
I'll never ask you to drink poison
Kool-Aid
I promise
all right yeah lucky all right that's
all for now uh the midterms will be
exciting
do you think I should live stream during
the
evening tomorrow
what do you say
man cave
yeah
Let's uh let's man cave this thing
tomorrow okay
I will see you tomorrow
bye for now YouTube
