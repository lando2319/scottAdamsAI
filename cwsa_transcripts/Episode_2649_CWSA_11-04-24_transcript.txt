well let's get ready for the best show
you've ever
[Music]
seen good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take this this experience
up to levels that nobody can understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a cuper m or glass
tanker Chels a St Stein a canteen Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
it's the dopamine hit it the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and damn it
it's happening right now go
my enjoyment of that
zip is unparalleled
really well let's talk about some
sciencey things and such then we'll get
into all the ugly politics I know you
want that you want it bad we got some
good stuff
today well according to what's up with
that what's spelled WTS what's up uh for
the second time in a week climate
scientists were surprised that with an
increased CO2 absorption mechanism so it
turns out that there were two things
that climate scientists might have
gotten wrong about CO2
absorption number one is how quickly
plants absorb it number two is how much
heat can be absorbed by the
ocean so let's say if you were building
a climate model to measure temperature
and two of the things that you knew you
got very wrong were plants and
oceans how do you think your final
number
looks let's see the only things we got
wrong were the plants and the oceans
well how about all the the clouds you
know just the regular H don't ask about
the clouds how about the sun and the sun
spots don't ask ask don't ask don't ask
so I always think that the climate
models are sort of the ultimate test of
how much you understand about the
world now I don't know if the I don't
know if the temperature of the world is
going up and I don't know if CO2 is
involved the only thing I know for sure
is that you can't tell with the climate
model that's the only thing I know for
sure but uh most of the world has been
hypnotized and to thinking that the
scientists although they're continually
updating the variables and assumptions
that go into the climate models they're
still right no no matter how many times
you change them still right and if
they're wrong we'll change them till
they're right again somehow because we
know it's right start with that and then
we'll make our models match
it all right uh here's some more science
let's see how you could have done with
this um would you have needed a study to
tell you the following
according to American Education research
Association students with a growth
mindset learn more in school there's
actually been a study of that now so if
you have a growth mindset you'll learn
more uh who who what kind of students
would have a growth mindset do you think
now a growth mindset the way they defin
it is that you believe that if you study
you can learn a lot
so what kind of people just sort of
naturally know that if they study
they'll learn a
lot would it be dumb
people would it
be smart people there you go there you
go
yep let let me use my own uh life
example where anecdote beats
Science Now normally science beats
anecdote here would be a case where
anecdote totally beats science when I
was about 6 years old and this is true
by the way I'm I'm uh you know making
into a more interesting story but it's
true when I was about six I looked into
a mirror and I said to myself you know
what I don't think you're going to play
in the
NBA and I was right turns out that I 6
years old I could accur accurately
ascertain I was not headed for the
NBA so then I said what the hell can you
do you'd better get some kind of a Life
Plan here you're not going to play in
the
NBA and so I said to myself well what am
I good at and I thought huh according to
all these adults they keep telling me
I'm smarter than average so I go hm I'll
bet I could learn a lot and so I
developed a growth
mindset because everybody including me
that I knew thought I would be good at
school and then I
was now did you really need to run a
study that people who are pretty sure
they're good at school and that going to
school and learning will be good for
them they end up learning more did did
we need to study
that did we I think you could have just
asked Scott next
time well I didn't see this coming New
York City has a drought apparently was
drier than normal in October and uh New
York City people are being asked to
conserve
water so
um so the city's falling apart uh
there's crime there's debt and uh not
nearly enough water so sooner or later
every blue state will turn into
California they won't have energy and
they won't have water and there will be
fires raging through the
houses which by the way is probably true
the the longer the longer estate remains
blue
probably the less water and energy
they're going to have because the way
they run stuff anyway we hope they do
well um did you know according to slay
news that the Biden Harris
Administration has licensed DNA vaccines
for the food supply so I guess they're
going to give vaccinations to the salmon
and some other stuff
doesn't it feel like the public should
get some kind of a say in that instead
of just going to the store one day and
you're chewing on your salmon it's full
of mRNA or whatever the hell they
decided to put in there now it's not
like I'm an expert that if you ask me
Scott do you think we should give this
salmon a shot I don't know maybe but I
feel like they should at least run it by
us you know hey we really think we
better give some shots to these salmon
cuz whatever we've been doing up to now
isn't good enough to which I say are you
telling me the salmon I've been eating
up to this point are all bad for me I
just don't
know but uh yeah don't drink the water
and uh don't eat the fish and uh you're
all going to die from climate
change there is a Soros
prosecutor who's been a thorn in the
side of people who don't like sor
prosecutors in La who's been blamed for
many of LA's problems but George gasone
is apparently losing badly like really
badly to the
Challenger and uh Joel Pollock is
writing about this in breart and I ask
you this do you think the country is
just
adjusting do you think that the country
has figured out that having a Soros
prosecutor is a basically a death nail
for your
state how how much do you think the
country is figured out because I you
know I'm in my own little Silo and I
never know does the rest of the country
know this or is this just some little
thing I see in my little corner of the
news but if the if the challengers up by
25
points uh according to the
times um that should tell the story and
in in my location the uh Soros
prosecutor is on the ballot for
Recall now if I had to guess I would
guess she's going to get recalled so
it's possible because you know you why
why would you even be on the ballot I I
think she's going to get recalled but so
we can actually get rid of a Soros
prosecutor in LA and San Francisco
potentially in the same
year that'd be kind of a big deal
anyway we'll see if that
happens do you know about project 65
that's that lawyer Mark Elias he's a
Democrat lawyer who's always pushing
things in the uh in the domain of
Elections some say he's getting away
with all kinds of weasy but legal stuff
and he's affecting the elections but
here's what's happening now this project
65 so so they're aligned with Mark Elias
they're running ads in every swing state
saying that if any attorney represents
Trump in regards to election Integrity
matters uh they might lose their
licenses can can you imagine
that that that's a real thing that's
happening that I I would say one of the
strongest things about the American
structure is that we give a a genu
genuine um at least we'll try to give a
real defense even to somebody who's
guilty but here's a case where even if
somebody's innocent they're going to
take out the defense they're going to
attack the defense even if they're
defending somebody
innocent so this is another case of uh
the Democrats making you think P the
sale which to me is the biggest story of
the year so you know the hi take is he's
making you think that Trump did steal
the election in
2020 uh or or claimed it was stolen when
it wasn't now nobody knows if that was
election election was stolen there's no
way to know
that so they're making you think past
the sale if if TR if Trump was right and
I don't know that either that the
election was rigged then everything
Trump does looks completely different
if it was not only not rigged but it was
possible for a human being to know that
it wasn't rigged and one of those human
beings was Trump and he knew it wasn't
rigged and he knew it was fair and
there's no evidence for that point of
view whatsoever well then he's got some
he's got some questions that need to be
answered I would say for sure I would be
very uncomfortable with Trump if I
believed he knew he
lost but because I'm not a idiot
I know that nobody can know if he won or
lost because we don't have a system that
would tell you that one way or the other
we we do have a A system that gives you
result but let me say it again if you're
positive you know that our election in
2020 was
fair you're a idiot and by the
way it might have been fair I'm not
saying it wasn't fair or it was fair I'm
saying that if you're sure you know
because because you were told that you
can know that that's knowable you're a
 idiot honestly where where have
you lived in this world where everything
is corrupt our our finance markets or
our health care stuff every part
of our country is corrupt and you're
going to tell me that you're sure you're
sure that 50 separate elections
were all done right you're an idiot
you're a idiot if you think
you're sure
you know that 2020 was fair and let me
say again I don't know maybe it was fair
maybe it wasn't but if you're sure it
was fair you're a
idiot there's no way around that right
you're a idiot or you've been
hypnotized
brainwashed I will allow that there are
people who would have a high IQ who who
have been brainwashed and to think he
was fair but think think about how hard
that brainwashing would have to go you
would have to erase what people know
about everything else in the
world because smart people know
everything else is
corrupt they haven't not noticed
that you smart people know that the food
pyramid was upside down for most of our
life you know smart people know that you
know we got into a war in Iraq and
didn't need to smart people know that
the you know the Russia collusion thing
was fake they know that the fine people
thing was a hoax smart people know that
but then they take all they know about
everything in the world and if they can
be convinced that the election was
definitely
fair well they're either hypnotist or
I'm wrong and they're just
idiots right because you can't get to
there by reason you just
can't so anyway that horrible thing is
happening on the Democrat side you know
I wonder if because I I'm obviously in a
news bubble too I wonder if the
Republicans are doing
something that evil is there something
Republicans are doing oh oh that's right
there if you're a Democrat you believe
that they're trying to fix the election
or claim that they won when they didn't
win but that's not
true is there anything
true that's happening that Republicans
are doing that's as dirty as the project
65 is there anything they're doing as as
dirty as really any of the claims that
the Democrats are making I'm not aware
of anything and and Trump does his
Hyperbole and you know does his
exaggeration but I'm not aware of
anything Republicans are doing that are
in the neighborhood of how completely
evil some of this
looks anyway but maybe I'm just in a
news bubble and I don't see it according
to just the news uh there was going to
be a giant spike in uh an of pocket cost
for patients for health care but um I
think for Medicare drug spending yeah
but uh the Biden Administration moved $5
billion around to delay that so you
wouldn't know that your health care
prices spiked before the election okay
so that should that should be grounds
for I would say grounds for uh
impeachment now I don't think there's
any impeachment rule that would impeach
you for this specifically but what if
it's true that your that your government
did a essentially a financial fraud in
order to win the election because I
would consider this a financial fraud if
the reporting turns out to be
true
again what is it that Republicans did
that was as bad as that if he asked if
he asked Democrats they'd say well uh
Trump made the Republicans turn down
that excellent excellent bipartisan
border bill but of course if you're a
republican you know it was not an
excellent excellent bipartisan bill it
was a amnesty bill it was the opposite
of what the Republicans wanted why did
one Republican negotiate it I don't know
nobody else knows either but the fact
that I don't know that doesn't make it a
good
bill anyway even snop says debunked the
uh folks that uh that Trump wanted Liz
Cheney to be executed by a firing
squad how many how many Democrats
actually believed that Trump said in
public that gun should be pointed at LZ
Cheney no none of that ever happened he
was talking about she wants to send
people to war but she hasn't been at war
war guns would be pointed at
you so so even Snopes debunk that but I
think Snopes only gets involved when
something is so bad that even Democrats
agree it's not true I mean when when
Bill Mara went on TV and said okay even
I can't go this far this thing about
Janie is just fake news you know why do
you keep doing this to me because
because I think Bill Mah is embarrassed
about being associated with Democrats
when they just make up the news and so
he called them out to his credit called
him out said you made up this news I'm
embarrassed being associated with you
basically and then Snopes does a little
cleanup work and they're like all right
all right maybe this one's not
true so I don't feel like we got to fact
check so much as we got let us fact
check some unimportant ones so when we
don't fact check the other ones that are
also fake you're going to think maybe
those are true so I worry that the real
game is not fact checking the real game
is making sure that some of the facts
don't get fact checked that's what I
worry
about well according to the Daily wire
Trump has filed an Fe complaint saying
the Washington Post is illegally
boosting articles that are good for AA
so so the Washington Post decided not to
endorse anybody publicly but the
allegation is that the Washington Post
has been uh somehow boosting those
stories so the Washington Post pays to
boost stories critical of
trump uh I don't know how they who did
they
pay aggressively ramped up its paid
advertising campaign boosting de oh okay
so they were basically doing an
advertising campaign for their own
newspaper The Washington Post and in it
they were boosting the anti-trump
Articles it sounds like
well I ask you
this is it possible to have a fair and
free election if the news is
fake what do you think what could you
ever say yes we had a fair and unrigged
election if you
knew for
sure that the news was
fake I would say obviously no obviously
no so the thought that we have fair and
free elections is so weirdly obviously
not true
because at the very least you'd have to
have accurate
information why is there a very loud
machine right outside my
window that could only be if my
neighbor decided that being really loud
before 8:00 a.m. was okay after all what
time is
it
7:20 7:20 a.m. and there's a bulldozer
under my window think that's okay does
that feel okay to
you especially when the person running
it I talk to personally said don't ever
do this before 8: amm because I got a
live show can you hear it by the
way can you can you hear the
engine no it's not the city it's my
neighbor all right
well I guess I won't take care of that
right now then
um so does uh Trump campaign have a case
well probably not because I doubt the I
doubt the news industry is going to get
published for being biased punished in
any way for being
biased but here's a good story from
uh so David Axelrod was trying to dunk
on Elon
Musk and he looked at something that
Elon Musk had claimed on the
xplatform and he said uh this so this is
David aarod well-known Democrat
strategist type person he said it used
to be that Twitter at least tried to
police thisinformation now its owner
traffics in it
uh uh all as he invests hundreds of
millions of dollars to elect Trump and
make himself a power wielding oligarch
now this is
amazing Axel Rod must know that the
people who follow him will believe that
this is true that Twitter at least tried
to police
disinformation but who gets to decide
what is thisinformation
who gets to decide well let's look at
this one example because Axel Rod was
responding to something that um musk was
saying online so let's check out what
musk was saying outline because
according to David Axelrod it would be
disinformation all right so here's what
musk said he was responding to an
Insurrection Barbie
post so so he's essentially accepting
what she said and then boosting it I
don't know if Insurrection Barbie is a
here or she actually but Insurrection
Barbie said if you don't vote and Harris
wins she will grant amnesty to every
single foreign National they have
allowed in here they will nuke the
filibuster pack the Supreme Court make
DC and Puerto Rico States and America
will be California now is that
hyperbole or is that
true well it's an opinion because it's
based on you know what is assumed will
happen in the front so opinions can't be
right or wrong can
they and to me it's obviously an opinion
but is the opinion based on something
solid enough that it's fair to say this
opinion well yes because prominent
Democrats have said they want to Grant
have an amnesty pathway You could argue
about every single one that part's just
obvious hyperbole but I wouldn't argue
that Democrats are looking to make them
citizens
um they'll nuke the
filibuster prominent Democrats have said
that multiple times uh they'll pack the
Supreme Court again prominent Democrats
have suggested that would be a good idea
now that's far from being a policy there
there's no haris policy to that uh for
the Phil Buster or the Supreme Court but
I believe that she and people in her
group have been for it so it's
reasonable to assume they might do the
thing that they vocally said they were
for right until the election started
right so if you were for something and
you never said why you changed your mind
it's pretty reasonable to say you might
still be for it
so and then making DC in Puerto Rico
States that's again something that
Democrats have been for all right so
these are a bunch of things that are not
necessarily things that Harris says she
wants to do at the moment but things she
has been aligned with in the past and
not distance past we're talking about
you know just last month or a few months
ago before she was officially the
candidate there were some things that
were crazy that she was in favor of that
she backed off a little bit but still
it's reasonable to
assume that she might still be in favor
of them she just can't say it until she
gets
elected so musk says about the
Insurrection Barbie thing he says H
those are their stated goals and that's
true there are prominent Democrats who
have stated these exact things doesn't
mean it'll happen and it doesn't mean
that President Harris would push them
but it does mean prominent Democrats are
pushing these exact things just as and
then he says unless Trump wins this will
be the last election he says the Dems
will legalize all the illegals in swing
States so there'll be no more swing
States America will become a one party
deep blue socialist State now those are
opinions but they're based on things
that Democrats have really said really
in
public and it wouldn't be too much
connecting dots to say that if they did
these things it would be one party Rule
and to that David axel R
says Twitter at least tried to police
disinformation imagine how mad you would
be if your entire plan for power
depended on controlling all the media
platforms but the biggest one the most
important one I would say x is the one
you can't
control that must really kill the the
top
Democrats that that really gets into
their game but at least all the other
news is true right uh
well David Sachs says this in the post
he says the biggest story of the week
was the jobs report October 12,000 new
jobs when 100,000 were
expected and the job growth is negative
if if the government jobs are excluded
September was 254,000 but revised down
31,000 August it was
159,000 but Revis down
81,000 um and as uh sax says in instead
they got us focusing on the presidential
polls yeah so yes there's a lot of
diversion going
on um here's a question now fiser King
one of my favorite posts or one of my
favorite accounts on X he says reminder
that Trump currently has a sentencing
date of November 26 on the quote 34
felony convictions thing so if he loses
the plan is to jail him quickly so he
isn't in a position to challenge any
irregularities in the
election now I did a little bit of
research with somebody smarter than me
who shall remain
nameless um who thinks that it's more
likely that it would just be appealed
and he wouldn't go to jail now is that
true he wouldn't actually be behind the
cell would he November 26 he would just
appeal and it would get pushed forward
and the probably the entire uh the case
might have to be retried because of
Supreme Court decisions recently so I
don't think he's going to be in jail but
you you got to think that they game this
out you got to think that the in in some
room in some room there must have been a
conversation where Democrats said all
right you know if we can get him in jail
and then they probably said oh he'll
appeal that won't work so they probably
have another plan
rasmason points out that 45% of the
people they pulled say that when states
are late in reporting their election
results it makes them less confident
that those are real results and yet
we've been told that it will take days
before we have our election results why
would a country that's so concerned
about election Integrity wait several
days to count the votes when they would
know there something like 4 5% of the
country would trust the outcome less if
it doesn't happen the same day as the
election why would they do
that I can't think of any reason can
you if it's not to cheat what would be
the
reason is it so they can have machines
instead of ballots is it
so why it doesn't seem to be any reason
other than to promote cheating because
other countries don't do this other
countries say even if it's mailed in you
have to mail it by this date so we'll be
done counting by this
date I don't know seems to
me very suspicious that something so
easy to fix and so big a problem would
remain unfixed
forever I can only think for there's
only one reason I can think of that you
wouldn't fix a problem that big that's
that that's that fixable
so here's a little exchange I had with
Ian brimer about our secure elections he
posted uh yesterday he said I have no no
idea who's going to
win uh he said I'm extremely confident
the election will be free and fair and
secure and most takes on social media
would have you believe exactly the
opposite they are lying to you okay well
I would be an example of someone who
believes exactly the opposite
about our elections being free and fair
I believe that by Design they're
designed to be the opposite of that it
would be easy to design them to be free
and fair and since we don't and yet we
have the full capability of doing
it I think the smart take is that
they're designed to be
rigged
now that was that was just that Ian
thinks that I'm lying to you am I lying
to you when I say everything in our
country is rigged
that's not a lie that's something you
could observe
yourself do you think the elections the
most important part like the one that
gives people the power and the money
ultimately you think that's the only
thing that's not rigged do you think
that state actors couldn't rig our
machines and get away with it without us
knowing it it it's almost insane or
something to imagine the saying that we
we can't be sure who won is somehow a
lie how could that be a lie
I could be
wrong I could definitely be wrong but
where's the lie I'm telling you exactly
what you see what you see is every
indust every industry that can get away
with polluting
does everybody who can get away with
cheating does everybody who can hide
something that's bad for them does
everywhere all the time every country
every organization every government
entity everywhere and I'm supposed to
believe this is the one time it doesn't
happen and I'm the dumb one I'm the liar
so that makes me the liar to say that
everything will go the way the same way
everything
goes if everything always goes One Way
always just always and I say everything
always goes one
way I'm lying to
you
so I responded and I said how could we
possibly know that in other words how
could we know that the election would be
free and fair and secure as Ian
says and I said it requires believing
everything in America is obviously
corrupt as the news shows us daily and
of course the news itself is corrupt
except for our election
systems so Ian responded he says uh uh
in terms of how could you know the
election is free and fair he says lots
of ways and then he parenthetically said
bipartisan audits studies Etc to know
that and to which I say wait a minute
bipartisan
audits we don't have a system that can
be audited why does Ian think we have a
system that can be
audited we don't have
that Ian Ian check this out here here's
my ballot so this is actually a napkin
but imagine it's my ballot I just filled
it out okay now now somebody came in my
office and I took it off my desk and I
put it in my
drawer so didn't get
counted did the audit pick that
up
now I just want to know who thinks you
can audit our
election if if a programmer got in and
changed the bits on the counting
machines who catches
that if we have uh known cases of
noncitizens voting which we do catch in
small numbers you know dozen here dozen
there how many got away
do we have a system that catches every
one of them does our audit catch every
one of
them how can you possibly think we have
an auditable
system
so bipartisan audits um they said
studies to which I say
studies what kind of study can you do if
you know that they're not
auditable what would the study say it's
not auditable but we still know the
answer
who who exactly would you pay to do
those studies how old are those studies
and did they look at every
state here here's what I think some of
it is I think jcal was taking a run at
this if you if you cheated so
big that it would like really change the
election it would be too hard to get
away with it but it doesn't need to be
big you can just force it to be a Thai
election you know until election day
which we saw them do right in front of
us I predicted a year ago it would be a
tie on Election Day no matter who ran
here we are it's a tie on Election Day
no matter who ran they actually replaced
the candidate and they still got a
tie so as long as the news can drive it
toward a tie then all you have to move
is a couple of Swing states which means
just a couple of thousand votes in a
couple places you maybe three places
would be enough so yes it can be really
small
I don't think we would necessarily catch
something really
small but uh Ian BR appointed me toward
a uh uh podcast that he had with a woman
who apparently is in charge of making
sure that our elections are fair and
free and she works for a group called
cisa
cisa now among other things I guess
their job is to make sure elections are
fair and free because the states do
their own versions of Elections so you
need some some kind of an auditor to
come in and make sure they have
resources that they need and that sort
of thing so cisa does that now cisa
works with uh let's see I looked at
their website they work with a group
called crowd strike crowd strike have
you heard of
them yeah crowd strike is part of their
cyber security uh infrastructure for
cisa so one of the ways they make sure
that your elections are fair and clear
is they get some uh SC software working
on those machines some a crowd strike
crowd strike software working on those
machines has anybody ever heard of a
crowd
strike does that name ever come up in
politics yeah if you yeah for all of you
those of you who follow Mike
Ben these names all have a different
meaning these are not the groups that
you look to for
credibility these are exactly the groups
you look to to reduce
credibility but remember I always tell
you that if you know what's happening
you don't know anything you have to know
the players so if I just told you oh the
government has a whole entity that's
their their whole purpose is to make
sure the elections are good that would
be telling you what's happening and you
wouldn't know anything now I'm going to
tell you who's doing it the people who
are most often accused of of bad
behavior are the ones in charge
the ones most often associated with bad
behavior cisa now do I personally know
any bad behavior they've done it's not
like I've researched it but you couldn't
get you could
not achieve a lower level of credibility
than having your elections checked by
cisa and crowd strike now again I don't
personally have any information about
crowd strike or Aisa I'm just saying
that if credibility is what wanted you
wouldn't go anywhere near these two
entities and and that that's supposed to
convince me now here's the funny
part the ciso representative I don't
know if she was ahead of it or just
ahead of the election part of it but she
was a
manager a
manager would you listen to a manager's
opinion about whether an election was
fair and
free has that have any of you worked in
the real world let me explain the real
world there are Engineers who know how
things
work and then there are things called
managers who don't know how anything
works or how anything is put together if
you talk to the engineers they'll say
things like
well the reason cisa has such a big
operation is there are so many places
that our elections could be vulnerable
and I'd say wait what yeah they do lots
of stuff I mean that's why they have the
crowd strike software that's why the the
audit tools and the the reason is there
are so many ways our elections can be um
rigged that they they're all over the
place to which I say so
engineer are you telling me therefore
that it's completely secure because cisa
is in so many places that there could be
problems how would an engineer answer
that
question an honest engineer would say
well really the the fact that there's
dozens and dozens of things holes we
have to
plug is kind of a strong indication that
there are plugs there are holes we
haven't plugged that we don't yet know
about because I would ask were all of
the all the holes that you plugged today
were all of them always plugged well no
that's why we had to have cisa so you're
saying that in the past we had holes
which we knew and until cisa came they
were not plugged right that's why cisa
was created so we could plug the holes
but didn't we think the elections were
always free and fair yes we did
so before any of the holes were
plugged we also thought our elections
were free and fair that's
right but yet they weren't or we
couldn't have possibly known because
there were holes yeah but they're
plugged now how do you know you plugged
all of
them well we're not aware of any that
need to be plugged at any time during
the process where you were plugging the
holes that are now plugged was there any
time when you had half of them plugged
and you were unaware that there might be
some other things that would come up oh
yeah that that happened we plugged the
ones we knew about a few more came up so
we plugged
them so how could you possibly know
you've plugged all the holes now well
nobody's complaining but if somebody did
complain tomorrow and pointed out a new
hole that you didn't know was there what
would you say then well we'd plug the
hole okay but you wouldn't know if
anybody had already used it
necessarily so the thing is if you talk
to the manager you know what the manager
says it's a perfect election we exist to
make sure that everything's running fine
we've checked it out and by the way I
get paid more if I do a good job
protecting the elections
you know my pay will depend on it I'd
get fired if I did a bad job of it wait
a minute are you telling me that if you
admitted the elections were not secure
you would get fired well yes of course
because it's my job to make sure they're
secure so so I'm supposed to believe
that the elections are secure because
I'm listening to a manager not an
engineer who could actually know what's
going on I'm talking to a manager who
would get
fired if you said the
opposite well I suppose that's true I
would get
fired and that was the best evidence we
have that our elections are fair and
free and
secure it was hilariously pointy haired
boss Dilbert territory kind of stuff you
would have to have no experience in the
real world to believe that the cisa
people had secured the elections now
again I'm not aware of a specific
problem but I live in the real
world I live in the real
world
anyway so Ian I think we're going to
need a much better argument somebody
said the 16 minutes did did an episode
uh last night I didn't see it but uh I
heard that it was uh geared toward
showing you that the Georgia elections
are real secure do you believe that does
anybody watching this believe that the
Georgia elections are
secure okay to me that's
absurd it's absurd now that it's also
possible that they are
secure but there is no
way that they could communicate that to
me a regular voter in a way that I could
ever believe it because it would be it
would be like a it it' be very much like
there's a UFO in my
backyard there is yeah yeah it's a UFO
from space it's in my backyard can I see
it oh no you can't see it can I see a
picture of it oh I should have taken a
picture really you didn't take a picture
of it you're there's a UFO in your
backyard and you didn't take a picture
well we did take a picture I can't show
it to
you yeah it feels like that there
there's no amount of 60 Minutes uh who
have been debunked as a new site and
have been revealed to be a propaganda
site essentially so 60 Minutes a
propaganda Outlet telling you that the
election is secure tells you what you
know that the person telling you it's a
propaganda outlet and they made a really
big point to tell you the elections is
secure what message did you
get the message I got was that they're
not secure because if you're going to
send somebody to tell me that the
elections are secure why don't you send
me somebody who's not a liar
because CBS are clearly Liars
they have no credibility whatsoever in
the news business if you want to tell me
that something is secure don't send the
biggest Liars in the world to
tell me they're
secure don't even try send me somebody
that I might trust 60 Minutes are you
 kidding me what a joke cisa are
you kidding me that's who I'm going to
trust are you kidding me that's
who I'm so to
trust well Morning Joe continues to be
hilarious in their
propaganda they said about K Harris
quote she delivers the message that I
think Americans want which is let's come
together I'm going to be president for
all
Americans so Morning Joe thinks that KL
Harris has a Unity message
maybe seems to me that Republicans have
been called insurrectionist white
supremacist
garbage deplorables if you
will um I don't see any possibility that
she's bringing anybody together and what
it feels like is that she just mugged me
and she's telling me it's time to unite
to which I'm saying how about you give
me back my wallet and then we will talk
about uniting nope I got your wallet and
I'm going to shoot you in the arm now
how about you nighting no I'm really mad
now you took my wallet and you shot me
in the arm damn it I'm going to kill you
well I'm now I'm going to kill you I
have to kill you because you're
dangerous now so they kill me if only he
had been willing to
unite if only he'd still be alive today
but it was his unwillingness to unite
with his mugger and abuser that caused
his downfall and really he had it coming
he moved the
Nate silver as you know famous pollster
thinks that maybe the polls are bunching
for the purpose of being
credible yes the polls are bunching for
the purpose of being credible which I
told you a year ago and every month
since then the polls will bunch to
pretend to be credible and then the
polls bunched to pretend to be credible
and naate silver calls it out because
it's
obvious um but as Alex Castellanos says
who's also he told Fox News this and
he's worked for various campaigns so he
knows what he's talking about he says uh
I think they're missing a massive shift
in voter registrations underneath all of
this 31 states have voter registration
by party and 30 of them in the past four
years have seen movement toward
Republicans um so he doesn't think it's
like a a wave but maybe a
wavelet so the idea
is that you don't catch the last minute
sentiments these polls might miss that
and that you can't have so many people
registering to be a republican unless
they're going to vote
Republican right so re it is reasonable
to assume that nearly all of the
Republicans who registered for the first
time did it for the purpose of voting
for Trump so I don't think the polls
have that in their in their numbers and
the reason they wouldn't have the new
registrations is because they're going
to look at how people voted in Prior
polls to figure out how they're going to
vote this time and all the the unlikely
voters who have newly
registered they don't have a history so
when the pollsters try to put the old
history into the new prediction they
can't do it because now the history is
destroyed by the fact that something new
happened a whole bunch of people
registered which is unusual for
Republicans to have more registrations
than Democrats at least
lately Nancy
Pelosi wants you to think about Trump's
cognitive ability she's hitting that
hard uh but this is that this is that
wrapup smear thing again so she's good
at the the wrap-up smear she she talks
about the
Insurrection so the remember what a
wrap-up smear is so a wrap-up smear
Nancy py actually explained this in
public that a politician will will leak
some story to fake news people the fake
news will run a story about it and then
the politician doesn't have to rely on
themselves as the source they can say
well look the New York Times has a story
about it I'm just I'm just quoting the
New York Times they're concerned about
let's say Trump's cognitive
abilities but it came from the
politician so the politicians tell you
that there was an Insurrection in 2020
which depends entirely upon uh Trump's
inner
thoughts and they've actually caused the
entire country to think past the sale
that we could somehow know Trump's inner
thoughts and that he knew he lost in
2020 even though the results looked very
much like he got cheated because of the
last minute change in the in the numbers
now I don't know that he got cheated but
I know that it looked like it and I know
that half the country said oh that looks
exactly like they cheated and if Trump
agrees with half the country which is
the vast majority of his his base you
know they're they're on the same side
the most
likely explanation what happened is that
he thought the same thing as Bas thought
he thought it was really really rigged
now
everything you see in the news and from
the um Democrats make you think past
that sale the sale is what did Trump
think at the time because if Trump
thought the election had been stolen
then everything he did makes a lot more
sense he was trying to stop a
steal that would be pro- Republic
pro-democracy
pro-america the way it happened not good
because there was violence but if you
were looking at the intentions and
whether he should be you know punished
for it orward rewarded for it it's based
on what he thought and what he thought I
think is kind of obvious because so many
of his Bas thought the same thing based
on looking at the same stuff I can
completely see why would they they would
think
it so also Obama dusted off the fine
people hoax again yesterday can you
believe that the fine people hoax the
most debunked hoax in American history
and the ex-president is using it on the
Eve of the election to change the news
this is fake news it's uh it does show
me that uh any positive thought I ever
had about Obama I need to remove because
there was a day when I said to myself
you know what I don't like everything
Obama does but he was a solid president
based on him pushing the fine people
hoax on the eve of the election I would
say I erase I take back every good thing
I ever thought about that
 I think he's a piece of now
I think doing this to the country is
absolutely it's close to criminal it's
very close to criminal Behavior I don't
think it is but it's as close as you can
get so I would say that the Obamas are
now uh in the hole shame Factory of
America there's nothing good about them
and Michelle Obama probably has a
 and I don't think that's true but
if he's going to do the fine people Oaks
I'm going to go with Michelle as a
and I'm going to say it every time he
says the find people Oaks because
Michelle Obama has a
 not really but I'll say that every
time he says find people
HS Doug mhof apparently is not aware
of things that people say about his wife
because he actually said this out loud
at a at
a at an event
he said quote kamla put her head down
and went to
work really there was probably a better
way to phrase that probably a better way
but uh there were memes there were memes
that's all I'm going to say she put her
head down and she went to work there
were
memes Trump said it is Rally quote I'm
not supposed to say this it's really not
very close we are leading in all seven s
States um I wouldn't be surprised if his
internal polling is better than the
public polling because the public
polling had to Bunch they're all
bunching intentionally the the private
polling that they all do at that level
doesn't have to Bunch it it just has to
be good so it's possible Trump's seeing
something that others are not
meanwhile DC is gearing up for trouble
and fences are being put around the VP
residents in the white house and do you
think that there will be a big
protest if uh people don't like the
election
results well I don't think it's going to
happen on Election night because we
won't have an answer what are you going
to be protesting so I I don't think the
networks will call the race for Trump
even if he's ahead so I don't know
exactly when sad protests would happen
or who would be doing it
but I suppose it's smart to be prepared
makes you wonder if the uh National
Guard has been
alerted do you think the National Guard
would be uh
employed or
deployed
maybe well a former MSNBC anchor who got
canned by MSNBC medy
Hassan um he's mad at uh both Biden and
attorney general Merck for not putting
Trump on trial before the 2024
presidential
election well if he' done it before the
election Trump would have already
cleared all of those election claims
because they would already been turned
over by the courts or people would have
forgot about him uh but again he's
making you think past the sale so if he
makes you think that they should have
put him in jail sooner he's making you
think well he's obviously guilty so why
didn't we do do this sooner but the part
where he's obviously guilty is where
he's making you think past the sale I
don't see him obviously guilty of
anything all I saw was
lawfare all I saw was even people in
CNN uh like fared Zario saying he
doesn't think some of these would be
even taken to court except it was Trump
so yes don't let him think past the sale
everything is making them think past the
sale if the 2020 election was F or not
their entire argument depends on you not
thinking about that and it's the
important
part all right well here's another thing
that the Biden
Harris um Administration was going to do
there were they were set to PL push
plant sources of protein over red meat
in their dietary
guidelines the Washington Free Beacon is
reporting on this and they say uh that
that was maybe delayed because the
election do you
think how how do you think uh the
Democrats would have done uh getting
votes from men if they had gone you know
you really need to be a vegetarian right
before the
election I don't think that would have
helped their vote with young
men I think young men like their meat
for the most part do you know who is
vegetarian college women young women
mostly so this is another indication
that uh Dem Democrats are the party of
women and I still take credit for being
the first person who said that the
parties would become the party of men
and the party of women I think I'm the
first one in the country to say this is
obviously going to happen and it did I
probably said that in
2016 so the PO post millennial says that
K Harris has a separate message she's
sending on the campaign to the Muslims
versus the Jews the American Muslims and
Jews um and that she is a little more
pro-israel with the uh the Jewish
Americans a little more Pro Palestinian
with the Muslim Americans now that's no
big surprise right because they're
politicians but I wondered does Trump
ever do
that I'm trying to think has Trump ever
had two messages for two different
groups of
people it seems like with all the
politicking the must have been some time
it happened but I I don't really see
that happen Trump is weirdly
honest in ways that I don't think um are
completely understood and here's one of
them he gives you one
message now you might not like the
message and you might think the message
is based on a lie or something but he
gives everybody the same message and
that strikes me as
honest when I watch somebody give
different messages to different groups
that strikes me as
dishonest
when
um I I just think that Trump even though
he's directionally accurate but fails
the factchecking you know quite a
bit that the directional accuracy is the
part I cared about you know um somebody
was challenging me on how much wall he
got built I think Jen was saying he
didn't build much wall to which I say
but he tried to build wall I mean he
tried nobody tried harder than he did he
tried different funding mechanisms they
kept thwarting him at every every turn
and he got some going you know got money
from the military
Etc so that's what I want I I want
somebody that I can observe doing
everything you could do to do the thing
that needs to get done if it doesn't
work well then I'd say you know keep
going do the best you can Etc but at
least it's in the right direction so for
me the fact that Trump does seem to do
directionally what he says he'll do
feels honest and so it is not having two
messages for two different groups of
people so um I get I'm completely aware
that the fact Checkers will tear them
apart and they'll say the the windmills
don't stop and turn off your TV and I'll
say he didn't really mean that don't
fact check that but but
directionally and on the big
stuff Trump is much more honest much
more
honest all right what are uh Tim Wall's
closing
lies uh Governor wall says there will
come a day when you're going to be
sitting on that rocking chair and the
little ones are going to ask you quote
when everything was on the line there
was somebody running who asked to be a
dictator no nobody did that and wanted
to over return the
Constitution nope no nobody ever did
want want to do that and talked about
using the military against our people
nope that wasn't a thing uh what did you
do to stop that from happening well
here's what the youngster should have
said Grandpa were you part of the Great
lying of the uh
2020s were were you one of the ones who
said that Trump wanted to be a dictator
and he wanted to overturn the
Constitution and use the military
against our people Grandpa did you
really say that well yes I did
well then it's time for euthanasia your
time is done that's how it would
go uh do you know Claire mcll she is one
of the dumbest people on MSNBC and boy
is that saying a lot MSNBC has these
wonderful characters U my favorite are
the eyebrow
historians that they've got two eyebrow
historians who who talk about history
with weird
eyebrows and the eyebrows are supposed
to really be the one that's that's
telling the story you can listen to what
come out at the mouth but look at the
eyebrows they're they're so concerned
they're so concerned about what's
happening look at my eyebrows look at my
eyebrows yeah so the eyebrow historians
are
hilarious um Victor Davis Hansen has
normal
eyebrows so if you want to see somebody
who's actually telling you what they
believe to be true about history look
for somebody with normal eyebrows not
this not this not no this is not normal
eyebrows don't do that
anyway so Claire mccal the possibly the
dumbest person on MSNBC the dumbest uh
Network and the dumbest show uh she was
mocking Elon Musk who might be one of
the smartest people in the world and
said quote he thinks because he can do
rockets and electric cars that he can
figure out how to get people to
vote he thinks he thinks just because he
can solve the biggest problems in the
world that he can also solve the easiest
one I mean how dumb is
he you got to be pretty dumb to think
that if you can solve the hardest
problems in the world that you'd have a
chance of solving think this is easy one
like getting people to
vote uh mus actually uh replied to it
because she also said that she was
worried about a billionaire you know
influencing elections and mus says uh
funny that she never said a word about
Soros who has cumulatively put a hundred
times more money into election than I
have and then he
says and this one is for the ages
folks this is for the ages this is Elon
Musk if I can figure out science with
SpaceX and surgery with neurolink then
maybe I can figure out politics too and
he puts a little shrugging little
shrugging icon
maybe yeah I think maybe he
can H let me put it in another way if
you had a
contest and it was Elon Musk versus
Claire mccal
and you could pick any
competition it could be science it could
be
engineering it could be
surgery it could be something about
space or
satellites it could be any kind of
objective uh academic test it could be a
test about history spelling
math it could be a
test of physical capability
I believe he could outrun
her uh lift more than she could and beat
her at literally any contest in any
domain any contest in any domain I think
he could beat her as
Scrabble I think you could beat her at
cards and so when I see Claire mccal the
dumbest person on MSNBC the dumbest uh
Network in the world
uh saying that the smartest person in
the world can't figure out one of the
easiest things to figure out how to get
people to
vote it's like it's like my dog
evaluating my you know my
calculus it's like you know I'm doing
some calculous and Snickers will be
there no idiot they be like what are you
talking about and Snickers will say well
that's not right and I'll say but you're
a dog you don't even know calculus I'd
say I know more calculus than you do no
you don't you're a dog you're you're my
dog you don't know any calculus well
we'll see that's what it feels
like meanwhile there's a story that uh
there are not enough ballots available
for our military overseas I suspect this
might be close to fake news there might
be some places where somebody didn't
know what room they were in there might
be some places where they didn't didn't
get him in time I don't know if it's a
massive problem but it's they throw it
in the mix people are worried that the
military didn't get enough now I'd be
worried about it because the military I
would think would go for Trump so if
they somehow figured down a way to screw
the military from voting on
time uh that would be a big problem I
mean if the military is over there uh
risking their lives for the country and
hypothetically if Democrats slowed down
their process for voting so maybe it
didn't
work that would be one of the biggest
scandles in the country just because it
would be so gross it's like really of
all the people you're going to screw in
a voting you're going to pick the
military
really now so I I have a hard time
believing they would do it just because
my brain can't get to that level of evil
but they've done more evil things than
that so nothing nothing's ruled
out uh Washington State there's a
nonprofit that claims that uh uh Bal
signature verification is
racist post-millennial is writing about
this so why would uh requiring ballot
signature verification be racist well
the thought is that I guess white people
can sign their name the same way
twice but according to this nonprofit uh
people who are not white are not so good
as signing their own name so that
sometimes it would look like a fake
signature when in fact it was real
now I don't know how many people can't
sign their own name but it feels like
not a lot but they had a better argument
for uh older
voters uh there might be some old people
whose signatures have changed that
happened to me my signature is not the
same because I had a problem with my
hand and they say that young people
maybe maybe haven't solidified their
signature yet so young people might be
discriminated against but I'd love to
see the people who actually checking the
handwriting because I've got a feeling
that they let they let differences in
the signature that are pretty
big go by if there's at least something
in
common that's what I guess so if the if
the signature doesn't look anything like
the same person then maybe they they
block it but if it looks like somebody
just got
older I don't know I feel like they
might let that go I'd be interested how
how accurate they are at sign insure
checks meanwhile some
Obama um judge in Arizona said that uh
Arizona must turn over the records of
1.2 million inactive voters so that they
can be checked against who voted except
they're not going to have access to it
until uh after the
[Laughter]
election so we'll be able to check if
the election was rigged
but not until it's too
late it'll probably be certified by the
time they work anything out all
right so we see reporting that both
sides Democrats and and Republicans are
making plans for what happens if the
other side claims that the election is
rigged and that will happen there's I
think there's nearly 100% chance that
both sides will claim it was rig
don't you if Trump wins by
Landslide we've got the best chance of
getting past it but it won't stop people
from saying it's rigged they're still
going to say it's
rigged they'll just say well you rigged
the landslide but you rigged it so and
they'll blame they're already blaming
Russia by the way the the cesa woman the
one that Ian Bremer said would make me
feel more comfortable with the elections
uh she kept going to Russia as the
problem and that Russia Russia Russia is
trying to influence our elections how
much
credibility did the ca woman get when
she started moving the conversation
always to Russia interfering with our
elections no credibility as soon as you
start talking like that I go oh okay
you're one of them you're you're not
really on our on our team you're just
saying
stuff so yes there will be big
trouble um I think it's all handleable I
think that everything that's coming is
within our ability to manage so if
you're worried about oh no will
everything fall apart Society will
disintegrate it
won't the the basic bones of the country
are still way strong enough so we'll be
fine it'll just we might miss some
deadlines or
something birkshire
hathway um
Warren Buffett's company is sitting on
an unprecedented amount of cash they
sold a lot but not all of their Apple
stock and they have $325 billion do in
cash that's unallocated now if you know
anything about Warren Buffett you know
that he doesn't love to have lots of
cash unless he thinks the stock market
is not a good deal but there's a lot
going on I don't think he sold just
because of the
elections um I don't think so I think
that he may have some big
plan um I would note that the entire
economy is going to require nuclear
energy and Ai and robots as far as I
know um Warren Buffett was not in AI or
robots or nuclear power much you they
might have had some hands in it so it
could be that Warren Buffett I'm just
speculating just just guessing uh knows
that the future economy will not look
anything like the current economy and
it's going to be power mostly nuclear
it's going to be AI it's going to be
robots it's going to be self-driving
cars so he might need to just make sure
he's got a big old ton of money uh in
those things that'll be the future so he
may be looking at buying a company for
example so he could be looking
at I don't know what he would buy but
325 billion will will get you quite a
bit meanwhile over in uh the Middle East
the IDF Israeli Defense Forces uh say
they're slowing down the ground
operations in southern uh
Lebanon and that Netanyahu is Seeking a
diplomatic agreement to secure their
Northern borders
now uh of course if they could get some
kind of security for cheap I'm sure
they'd like it the other way to do it
would be to just destroy
Lebanon which if they had to I think
they'll do it so they're in a good uh
negotiating position because it's pretty
clear that they're not going to stop
until they get security and they don't
have it now so if uh if there's nobody
willing to negotiate it in a way that
would make them happy I think you could
count on them continuing on until
there's nothing left that's that's a
risk but the other possibility is
they're just stalling and waiting for
Trump to get an office under the theory
that if Trump's in office Israel will
look like has more backing maybe and uh
would be more able to get a good deal so
could be they just want
to keep their options open until Trump
sah because they could get a better
better outcome maybe we shall
see well that ladies and gentlemen is
all I had for today how you feeling
about tomorrow I'm sure you've all voted
maybe some of you are going tomorrow but
um I I'll double down on my prediction I
think Trump's going to win on
votes I don't think that necessarily
means he's president so it's going to be
a pretty big fight I do think he'll win
in the
end but it's going to be a hell of a
fight and I think we'll miss some
deadlines I'm not sure that January 6th
will be certified I'm not sure that
anybody will be
um put in office on January 20th but
maybe by the end of January you maybe
there's a court case maybe maybe
somebody
concedes we we'll get
there we will get there we'll be
fine I mean like I told you everything
in the country is already corrupt but
we're still we're still bumping along so
I think it'll be just more of that uh
