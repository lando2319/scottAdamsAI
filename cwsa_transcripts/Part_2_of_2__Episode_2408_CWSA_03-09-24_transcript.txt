yeah all right well I guess I'm done
with that so the Sam Harris was trending
which is never good news for Sam Harris
and uh this joeo guy said Sor success
and every failure means nothing there's
no good and evil because people have no
say in their actions it's a dangerous
line of thinking and what I was saying
was I don't believe in Free Will what am
I doing that's
dangerous Sam Aris doesn't believe in
Free Will what's he doing because of
that that's
dangerous are are we committing some
crimes because we don't believe in Free
Will no you act exactly the same if you
believe in free will or not so it's not
dangerous it's the opposite of dangerous
it's just a little philosophical thing
that has no impact on you whatsoever
because you're going to do what you're
going to do and then you're going to
rationalize it after the fact always
have always will doesn't matter matter
if you know it knowing that you do it
doesn't stop it because you don't have
another way to act there's no other way
to be we just act like it's
real but in general you should always
believe that a claim that magic exists
is never as strong as they claim that
magic doesn't exist so um Free Will is
sort of connected to a
soul and those would be magic in the
sense that're not part of the physical
cause and effect world so I'm going to
call Magic anything that's outside of
physics
basically um so it might exist but it'
be outside of physics so if you're going
to ever guess the likelihood of
something the person who says you're
only imagining that there's magic it
doesn't really exist is going to be
right so far every
time 100% record never been wrong yet
that magic is it real
so um but more to the point when Joo
says but there would be no meaning to
life if we don't have free
will it's deeper than that there's no
meaning to
meaning you don't have to worry that
there's no meaning to
life because the word meaning doesn't
have
meaning is anybody on that
page do you understand that there's no
meaning to the word meaning
what's that mean so not having it
doesn't mean anything and having it
doesn't mean anything but I'll tell you
what feels like
meaning uh and this is actually one of
the most useful things you'll ever hear
what feels like
meaning is anytime that you're close to
the meting
process you'll always feel like you have
meaning for example you could be you
know terribly unhappy in your day-to-day
life in your family life but if you're
part of a process of raising young
people into older people you have
meaning you know it might not be a joy
every day but you'd have meaning you'd
like oh yeah my meaning is to take care
of my family so if you're you know
dating you feel like you have meaning if
you're working out at the gym so that
you could be healthy so that somebody
will want to mate with you that's part
of the mating process so everything you
can do whether it's earning money going
to the gym eating right dating starting
a family every part of that connected to
the most basic things that a human does
which is our our most important impulses
to create more humans everything is
subsidiary to that and not because it's
not because of some intellectual reason
is we evolved so that the people who
reproduce are the ones who survived so
we we have this imperative that's
evolved into us and when you're
consistent with the imperative you're
doing anything that helps
and it could be indirect like you could
be a school teacher that's definitely
helping because you're creating you know
good people out of you know young
people so if you want meeting find
something that supports uh the process
of humans surviving and thriving and
that will give you a sense of meaning
every
time uh here's a climate reframe that I
thought was amazing Alex
Epstein um he does a lot of writing and
talking and uh
advocating on the topic of climate so
instead of addressing climate
change here's the
reframe the reframe is climate change is
the wrong target we want to quote reduce
climate
danger oh that's good if you say you
want to stop climate
change that drives a certain set of
behaviors if you say you want to reduce
climate danger that's a whole different
behaviors and what's more important
stopping a
change or stopping how it affects us
poorly there's a big difference the best
thing you can do is is get rid of the
danger and we've been great at that so
far um so if you're trying to reduce the
danger you might for example uh let's
say reinforce your
dkes you know reinforce the dkes that
would reduce your danger but if you want
to reduce the
change well good luck you're going to
have to tell China to do different
things we can't so working on reducing
the change might be impossible but
certainly you could work on reducing the
danger that's a really good reframe
that's probably the best reframe I've
heard yet on uh climate and it was right
there it was sort of
obvious but it took uh it took until
Alex said it out loud that it made sense
so apparently Hunter Biden came up with
some conspiracy theory uh defense for
his tax charges is not paying taxes
charges and the idea was that the only
reason he's being
charged uh or maybe there's a little
special attention on is because the
Republicans are pushing
it so that was that was Hunter's defense
in part that it's because the you know
the whole the comments just stop
oh there we go uh that it was really the
Republicans and Trump was really behind
it because they're making a big
political thing out of it and it
wouldn't be such a big
deal uh if not for that but that was
rejected and here the quote of how it
was rejected is kind of funny the
defendant fails to explain how President
Biden or the Attorney General to whom
the special Council reports or the
special counsel himself or his team of
prosecutors are acting at the direction
of former president Trump or
Congressional Republicans or how this
current executive branch approved
allegedly discriminatory charges against
the president's son at the direction of
former president
trump it is pretty funny that he's
saying the only reason he's being
charged is because Republicans and
Republicans have no power it's entirely
the Biden Administration doing all of it
their own appointees and and he's still
claiming it's the damn Republic
an anyway let's talk about the Tik Tock
ban which might have something to do
with why my internet doesn't work I
don't know um but both Trump and VI have
now come out in opposed to Banning
it so V and Trump are both opposed to
Banning Tik Tock and Trump used to be in
favor of
it on top of that Rand Paul and Thomas
Massie are both against Banning
it now what do those four people have in
common Rand Paul Thomas Massie vake and
Trump well I haven't heard from Trump
directly but I can say that V Rand Paul
and Thomas Massie have something in
common that they talk about Tik Tock as
a data security
problem when that's not the problem it's
just one of them the problem is
persuasion
that's the dangerous part and they all
they all uh sort of obviously ignore the
obvious I mean it's just the biggest
thing and they just act like that's not
the thing now if if these were stupid
 idiots what would I say is the
explanation for why they can't seem to
understand this simple
concept I would say they're
idiots right if uh if dairo said this i'
say oh you idiot you don't even
know that persuasion is the main problem
suppose
uh I don't know some democrat said it I
just say idiot but what happens
if Rand Paul Thomas Massie and V are all
on the same side and all very very
consciously and knowingly ignoring the
biggest part of the story how do you
explain
that there's only one
way it's not that they're
stupid yeah apparently the CIA has
already penetrated Tik Tock and can get
everything it
wants and maybe they have some value
because if you're in if you're inside
any of the social networks then you can
track all the terrorists and the bad
guys and do all the things that the CIA
needs to do so my guess is that they've
already figured out how to corrupt it
without owning
it otherwise otherwise there's no way
that Trump would have changed on this
right you know a liberal woman who
screamed in your face Scott Adams is an
idiot oh
yes so there's something going
on all right would you agree there's
something going
on because I've reminded all of these
people at some point that's the
persuasion risk they've all heard it
they all know it but they're ignoring it
why are they doing it so
pointedly well they're lying they're
lying so in my opinion Rand Paul Thomas
Messi and V are all
lying and uh Trump as well probably so I
think all four are just lying to
us about what I can only
speculate but I speculate that they're
lying um because there's some bigger
play here that we don't understand in
other words there might be a national
security benefit to keeping it that they
know about but they can't tell us but
they're definitely lying the the thing
is that when you see these four people
lying to you about this there's
something else completely going on would
you agree that there's something going
on and they're definitely
lying yeah definitely lying definitely
something else going on but here's the
weird part these are all people I
trust isn't that
weird that if you if you said name four
people who you know not counting
hyperbole you know Trump does a lot of
hyperboy but when it comes down to
something that's
real I believe these are four people who
would not lie to me unless the National
Security was at stake so there must be a
national security element to this that
is not obvious to us because I don't
believe these four are stupid they're
not they're the most brilliant people
around and they definitely know what the
real problem is the persuasion so they
must have gotten a handle on it the CIA
must be driving more than we know maybe
they have actual functional control of
the algorithm by
now Kevin oir said that there's no way
Tik tok's going to be banned because uh
if is forced to be sold which is one of
the options they have to either shut it
down or sell it to an American Uh Kevin
L said he'll buy it he's not an American
is he
isn't he
Canadian yeah so do you think that
America would allow it if a Canadian
owns
it here's the problem so Kevin o you
know we he's a naturalized citizen
somebody
says that would that would make a
difference to me is he a naturalized
system wife is a
wife is
American well it would be an interesting
thing I don't trust
Canada so if Canada has any power over
Kevin o I wouldn't trust
him I trust him but not if Canada is you
know making him a puppet because it's
his
country so i' I'd be leer that I don't
know that anybody will be able to buy it
because um bite dance doesn't want to
sell it so they're saying they won't
sell it we'll see um and of course uh
Tik Tok continues to advertise in Fox
News this what a Fox News Major
advertisers now so everything that you
think about Tik Tock must be
wrong it must be wrong and it's
interesting that all four of these
people would be willing to destroy our
children to maintain it and and they're
giving us the argument that is
free
speech do you think that any of these
people think that propaganda from China
is Free
Speech they don't believe that of course
not so they are lying to us I just don't
know what the real truth
is sure it's not good though um I don't
think they're all bought by China but
that would explain it all wouldn't
it if all four of them were owned by
China from Trump through ran Paulo
Thomas Massie and that would explain
everything we see wouldn't it so you
can't rule that
out I I hate to say it but you have to
consider one of the possibilities that
China has functional control over all
four of these people because it doesn't
make sense what they're saying what
they're saying is nonsense it's like
it's like they suddenly became stupid or
something so there's something else
going on because they're not
stupid anyway the state of the union is
still reverberating bill and everybody's
calling Biden
feisty I guess he's feisty that's the
that's the word we're going to use now
now he got a bump from it and I will
agree he he exceeded
expectations but do you think he can
keep it up nobody thinks he can keep it
up so I think that whatever bump he got
from the state of the union will wear
off a few
weeks yeah uh 35% of viewers said they'
had a negative reaction but most people
seem positive about it
um dairo was on the
show Robert dairo the uh the B he's the
basket case um let's say I guess he's
the face of
TDS so Bill M asked them um about the
militarization of the New York
subways and uh apparently he hadn't
heard about
it just hold that in your head
daero who lives in here City hadn't
heard that they were militarizing the
subway uh but he but he said that if
Trump had militarized the
subway uh that it would be for a
different
reason because if Trump did it then you
know it's part of his dictator takeover
but if the governor did it he's like
well he's going to have to look into it
he does he hasn't heard about
it okay uh but this is what Dao says
quote talking about Trump if he wins the
election
you won't be on the show anymore talking
to Bill M he'll come looking for me
there'll be things that happen that none
of us can imagine that's what happens in
that kind of dictatorship which is what
he
says and he says you should take him at
his word that's what Bill Mah says took
him about his word and then Bill Mah
says the one thing he knows about Trump
is that he'll never give up
power
he's not the
president he gave up
power he had no plan whatsoever for any
kind of
military
takeover there's no evidence that he
ever planned anything except finding out
for sure whether the election was
rigged how in the world does TDs guard
Bill Maher sit there and say I knew he
would never give up power what he
watched him give up power now he tried
he tried of course to cling to power
with you know uh a political process but
if all it is is a political
process why are we afraid of it we're
supposed to do political
processes
wow so here's why um dairo probably
doesn't know a single Republican let me
speak for every single Republican may I
may I speak for every
Republican who would be okay with
locking up daero and Bill Mah because
they say things you don't like wh which
Republican would be in favor of locking
them up for their
opinions you're
lying no you don't believe that you're
being hyperbolic there you do not
believe that you would lock them up for
their
opinions stop it you just make it worse
none of you believe that and you'd have
to never have met a republican to think
that they would want to lock up anybody
for having a bad political
opinion yeah now let's let's do it the
other way let's suppose you did a poll
do you think uh bill marah should be in
jail for his political opinions how many
Republicans would say yes to that
none except people joking right some
people would joke or something but none
basically none now imagine this how many
uh January 6 protesters who are
nonviolent nonviolent should still be in
jail what do you think Democrats would
say they'd say all of them they should
all be in
jail this is another case of Democrats
projecting Democrats would
project that Republicans would do what
they've done to
Republicans do you know why they think
that Republicans might do it because
they're talking about
revenge and apparently they're
completely aware that Revenge would make
sense as a concept do you know when that
makes sense it makes sense when you're
doing something that's so bad that
Revenge makes sense so they are
completely aware that what they've done
is so bad that they don't need to worry
about revenge
now you could argue no Scott they think
it's not you know it wouldn't be um a
legitimate Revenge it would be just bad
people doing bad things but I think at
some level they know they're the
baddies on some level they would never
say it but there's no way you could
watch your own team putting people in
jail for
protesting when we have a protest
country and to imagine that that wasn't
complete Hitler like
activity I think they know it on some
level so should they be afraid that a
trump dictatorship would get revenge and
put in jail just for free
speech it would be good
Revenge but uh I would certainly do what
I could to stop
it right I I don't want to live in a
country where Bill Mah and Robert daero
are in legal Jeopardy legal Jeopardy we
could take away their freedom because
they had an opinion you don't
like no I'm not going to live in that
country now if that happened I would be
in favor of assassination of the
president let me say it
directly if if Trump ever gave the order
to round up daero and Bill Maher for
their
opinions then I think the President
should be assassinated
so just in case you're wondering where I
stand on
it that's never going to happen so you
don't have to worry about it like it's
never going to happen it's just crazy
crazy
 all right uh the maze account ma
good follow on
xplatform um points this out said last
night I talking about the State of the
Union Biden complained that the tax code
is unfair teachers not paid enough the
cost of college is too high America
needs more clean energy jobs Russia is
under of control and that the cost of
healthcare is too high that's what he
said at the State of the Union let's see
what did he say during at 2008 at the
DNC uh Biden said that Obama would
reform the tax code Pay Teachers more
make colleges and Healthcare affordable
hold Russia accountable and create a
bunch of clean energy
jobs well at least he's
consistent he just doesn't realize that
Obama didn't get it I
guess uh there's some thought Laura
lummer says she's got a scoop that VI
was uh favor to do the rebuttal to the
State of the Union but that Mitch
McConnell uh vetoed that and instead
they came up with Katie Brit who is
trending on the xplatform simply for
being
terrible
um and that's bad and I think is both uh
Republicans and Democrats are hitting or
the same I don't think there's I haven't
heard a single Republican say anything
except this is a nightmare this is
terrible imagine showing that as your
bench yeah the whole idea of you know
the usually some upand cominging person
uh doing a good job in the rebuttal is
that you're showing you have a deep
bench you know maybe you're preparing
somebody now correct me if I'm wrong but
although Obama kind of came out of
nowhere because he was a you know Junior
Senator hadn't been in office very long
um but when you heard him talk you got
it right the moment you heard Obama talk
you go oh he does have the goods he's
very inexperienced relatively speaking
but yeah he's got he's got that
presidential
thing can you tell me what Republican or
Republicans know Katie Britt and know
her work and said to themselves oh she's
going to light it up she's going to give
us some Obama level
Charisma how in the world did this
decision get made we should know who
made this decision I don't know if it
was McConnell but whoever made this
decision is not
capable would you agree whoever decided
this was a good idea is not capable
person I don't know how that happened
well the news is today is that Lura
Trump is going to be the co-chair of the
RNC who's the chair did they pick a
chair of the RNC and I missed that
news because they say the
co-chair any
anybody but have they picked somebody
for
sure I I have an every news that they
have a chair much less a co-chair Watley
who's Watley they actually did pick
somebody well I guess I'll catch up on
that a lot of people are saying Watley
it's a name I've never
heard
W anyway people are saying uh typically
oh my God it's nepotism how could you
possibly hire a family member uh look at
the disaster with Jared and uh and ianka
so I saw that an X because the disaster
of Jared and
ianka what was that
disaster Let's see we had
ianka who almost everybody agrees was a
positive you know she sort of a softer
female version that Trump respected gave
him a little more perspective I think I
don't think anybody complained about
aanka did they even once I've never
heard even one complaint and Jared got a
Abraham
Accords what did he do wrong I mean you
would almost think that hiring your
family is a good idea if these were the
only examples now let's talk about Lara
Trump now she's interviewed me a few
times um on uh
zoom and my impression was very
capable very
patriotic very
charismatic all the energy in the world
connected to the right
people she's kind of
great do you agree am I wrong about
that yeah to me she seems like a strong
choice and uh we'll
see yeah anyway uh John brenen was on
MSNBC saying that the Intel community
may uh not give Trump
as a candidate they might not give him
all the good stuff because uh because of
his quote misuse of classified
information now when MSNBC brings John
Brenan on to say that Trump won't isn't
trusted by the intelligence Community
what is
that that's exactly what it looks like
yeah Brennan is part of the uh current
and ex intelligence people who actually
run the country and MSNBC and NBC News
are among the vehicles that they use um
for influence so you're seeing the
actual people who are in charge of the
country um what once you see who's
actually in
charge everything makes sense after that
everything makes
sense all right uh heard a little bit
more about IVF I was try to figure out
why some conservatives don't like IVF
but Trump's in favor of it and uh the
argument goes that that uh the IVF I
guess you fertilize more than one egg to
make sure you've got at least one good
one and that it's common practice to
either freeze the extras or abort them
some people would say the word abort
because they're fertilized now this is a
problem for anybody who believes that
life begins at
Inception Inception would be the
fertiliz
a um so that's the argument I was not
aware of that argument because I uh as
you know I do not believe in uh Magic
and so it never occurred to me that
somebody would think a fertilized egg
has a soul how many of you think a
fertilize egg as a
soul 100% yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes and so all right let me ask you a
related idea how many think a soul is a
real thing
how many thinks that a soul is a real
thing yes yes yes all
right now I do understand that um the
belief and science are different
things so I'm very Pro
religion which means that I respect your
opinions are you okay with that are you
okay if I disagree but I have complete
respect for your opinion and and I have
a lot of respect for anything that is
airing on the side of
life I respect that it's not the choices
I would make personally in my own life
but when I see other people airing on
the side of life you know if there's any
question whether it's life got to save
it I'm glad I live among them I'm glad I
live among people who put life as their
top
requirement um but I also can see why
people would have a different point of
view so you have my maximum respect
while I have a different view are you
okay with
that
good now we understand each
other um so now I understand what your
point of view is and there's no arguing
whether a soul exists or a soul doesn't
exist right there would be no point of
that and by the way why would I want to
do it why would I want to talk you out
of
that for some convenience for myself
um I don't know it's there there are a
lot of things where you like the fact
that there people on the other side
there's like a useful
tension so one of the places that
there's a useful
tension uh would be you know somebody
who's Pro Trump and somebody who's
against Trump right so uh it's useful
that they're anti-trump people it's use
use ful that they're anti-biden people
because it's the you know the creative
tension that allows you to do anything
otherwise you end up with a
dictator however um I've long predicted
that AI is going to make us wonder about
souls because once AI is
indistinguishable from a human life
which is guaranteed at this point um
we're going to have lots of questions
about whether or how a
soul it's going to get complicated
um Trump is getting a little more
controversial lately uh first of all
backing IVF that might be a problem for
his supporters but also he's
full-throated Pro
vaccine not PR mandate but he says that
he says the vaccine saved us from
Co I know I know you you can say it in
the
comments he says he says the vaccine
saved us now keep in mind he has to say
that because if it's not true then he
oversaw a mass
murder so Trump has to say it
worked he couldn't get elected and you
know his his legacy would be destroyed
if it didn't right now how many of you
would say it's fair to say that it did
work work briefly for older people not
during Omicron but during the heavy fase
is anybody believes that the
science when objectively looked at shows
more benefit than uh
cost because that that's the current
scientific consensus which doesn't mean
anything that's the current
consensus but you don't believe the so
you don't believe the doctor even uh
even the doctors who are
conservatives because there'd be a lot
of conservative doctors who would agree
that it did work for older people and
during the worst part of it but not
during
Omicron all right well I'm too bored
with the argument about vaccines and
Ivon and all that stuff I'll just point
at the political ramifications are
people are going to have a hard time
voting for Trump aren't
they yeah I think Dr Drew says that it
looks like it was more benefit than not
for the older
people don't
know all right um Alex Jones you know
says it's
BS so he's going to Trump is going to
get a lot of push back on the vaccines I
feel like there's a better way to handle
the vaccine question and crowing that he
was a big success is not going to get
him any Democrats but it's definitely
going to cost them Republicans so why is
he doing it don't you think there's a
better way to frame
it here's how I would have framed it if
I were
him well actually there is no way to
frame this
right I I think V would have helped him
out here if there was any way to do it
right probably wasn't there probably was
no way to there's probably no way to win
on this
argument CU he's just too a associated
with the vaccine and there's no way he's
going to change people's mind about
that all right uh there's new
Alzheimer's drug from uh Eli Lily but
the FDA is delaying it because they want
to get some more information uh they're
they're they're going
to make a let's say more scrutiny on it
that's the quick version and it makes me
wonder if the FDI is FDA has found uh
religion or is this
normal do do you think they're trying
harder not to put any dangerous drugs
out
there yeah I said
FDI I don't know it's probably just a
bureaucratic thing uh we heard more
about Mitch McConnell's uh
sister-in-law who died in the lake
trapped in her Tesla and we all
suspected that there was um some kind of
Foul Play well it turns out there was no
foul
play uh but I'm very sad that I know it
because the reason we know
it if you haven't heard of this this is
terrible she made a phone call while she
was submerged in the
car yeah she made a phone call while she
was submerged in the car so now we know
that it was just she hit the wrong pedal
and you maybe she had a drink or
something but she hit the wrong pedal so
so there was nothing to it except she
literally just was trying to back up and
backed up down and apparently it slowly
submerged and she made a phone call and
the emergency crews didn't have the
right equipment when they got
there the emergency
crews didn't have the right equipment so
they didn't have any they didn't have
any scuba you know the divers could have
broken a window and you know maybe their
breathing tube until they get get
out um but they also didn't have a long
enough
toe so they couldn't tow it out fast
enough and they couldn't get to
her and some apparently some of the
people who were in attendance at the
event uh one of them dived in one of the
women dived
in I
can't you know I thought that uh Gaza
food tragedy where some food dropped on
some people people who already had 51
days the worst thing ever but this is
right at the top of my nightmare
scenario uh the only good news and it's
hard to call it that is that it wasn't
some kind of a plot it was an
excident I feel as
though uh musk needs to fix
this there there needs to be some kind
of uh uh like an emergency ejection seat
you not actually an ex but something
that would blow the top off or
something
yeah Auto Glass
breaker how many of you carry a uh
windshield breaker in your
car you know I used to but I don't think
I have anymore I think I might add
one all
right all right well that's all I got
for today too bad those other platforms
