hey everybody
come on in come on do you have your
coffee ready
do you yeah well good run if you don't
run i say because it's time
for the best part of the day it's called
the simultaneous sip and coffee with
scott adams
luckily i'm scott adams so that means
you're in the right place
at the right time two things that went
right for you today
and i think you know what's coming yeah
yeah all you need is a copper marker
glass attacker challenger steiner
canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's gonna happen now
go
all right i will add now to your list of
twitter accounts which you should be
following
because there are people that i'll quote
often and have
useful different things to say and this
one is
rasmussen reports so the folks who do
the rasmussen poll
you need to follow their twitter account
because there's more interesting stuff
coming out of their polls
than there is in the news right now
actually so the polls are more
interesting than the news
here's uh something that rasmussen
reported it was on a
tweet today two-thirds of all americans
65 years and older have been vaccinated
what did that kind of sneak up on you
i didn't think it was as good two-thirds
of all americans over 65 have been
vaccinated
wow is that true
and what should we be asking instead
what percentage of obese americans have
been vaccinated
sorry but we're in a health crisis and
we can no longer
pretend that being overweight
is healthy there was a
tweet i saw this morning talk about
timing
um let's see jose rosada
just twitter user uh tweets a cover of
cosmo from just a month ago
that showed a um i've told you before i
don't do fat
shaming so when i go into this topic if
i use a word like fat
it's not an insult word i'm just
speaking casually okay
are we on on the same page we're not
doing any fat shaming
here today or any other day but we'll
speak casually about it
because it's important um so it was a
photo of a very overweight
woman uh prancing around on the cover
and the
cover said basically that this is
healthy
i showed a very very large woman said
this is healthy
now i'm not going to comment on whether
that is a good or bad thing to put on a
magazine cover but i will tell you that
the current information is that the odds
of dying from covet are 10 times higher
if you're above a certain weight 10
times
the pandemic was really an
overeating pandemic it really was
because if you needed two things to die
nine and a ten times you know it's not
not a complete
uh statement but if you needed two
things to die
you needed the virus but you also most
of the time
like 9 out of 10 times you had to be a
certain weight
was it the virus that killed you
or was it having two problems that
killed you and
either one of them would not have
individually how do you say it's the one
thing that killed you
and not the other thing when both of
them are known to be deadly health risks
and you need both of them most times you
know
nine out of 10 times you need both of
them in order to have the worst result
so i feel as if this is another case
where
being trying to be uh politically
correct
which is to say that people who are
above a certain weight are
perfectly healthy because we know that's
not true
we know that's not true but again
don't do fat shaming it's a legitimate
medical
issue and
it's just it's crazy that we ignore it
now here's a counter factual we saw that
the countries that have the worst
weight problems also have bad outcomes
but wouldn't that hold for states
within the country shouldn't you expect
the same correlation
that wherever you have the uh largest
citizens you should have the worst
outcomes right
here are three states in the united
states
who are unusually good
on controlling weight three states
that have low bmi so these are these are
the
least fat among the least fat states in
the united states
here they are
the least fat people are let's see
new york new jersey
and california how did they do with the
coronavirus three worst ones right so
our three
are three three of among the the
skinniest of our states new york new
jersey
and california pretty big difference
between
their weights in these those states and
other states and they did the worst
they did the worst what's that mean
well we every time we think we found the
golden nugget of data that explains
everything
ah sweden now we know it's oh no we
don't
oh it's the bmi every time you see okay
no that doesn't work there are just a
few too many variables going on
i'll just toss out a few things that
could be making this
misleading number one florida
does not have a border with mexico
why is it that every time we mentioned
california
every time why don't we say well
california
is basically mexico now when you're
looking at the virus
because once the border becomes porous
and largely it was porous during
trump as well that's not just something
new with biden maybe it's worse
but why do we not mention
that california and mexico should be
effectively seen as the same
continuum of virus problem the border
doesn't have doesn't have meaning
to a virus whereas florida's over there
surrounded mostly by water and then
united states
does that not matter are we going to
treat
treat that like that's not a variable
that needs to be put into the
conversation
um yeah i feel as if that's another
wokeness problem where we can't mention
that it seems obvious that if you have a
porous border
during a pandemic you have less control
of quarantining and stuff i mean that's
not
that's not a statement about anybody
right that's just math
so i guess we're not allowed to say that
so we're not allowed to say that
it was a weight problem as much as a
virus problem
as much as it was a virus problem it was
equally a weight problem if we can't say
that out loud
how do you fix things if you can't even
talk about them right and we don't have
to
shame anybody to just state that there's
a health in black
all right um
even california is starting to open up
even my restrictive stupid and competent
state
starting to open up so even some mass
events
will have small crowds but there'll be
at least big events
i don't know about you but
today is the day
i feel like we won
now one of the problems with uh beating
a pandemic is that there's no
day when you can say oh the war is over
it's not like you
fight a regular war against people and
then you have an event and you sign a
sign a peace deal or whatever surrender
deal
and you have a day that that's the end
of it so the pandemic won't have a day
i feel like we need one i feel like we
need one
when it's over whatever day everybody
who's smart
says yeah it's definitely over we should
have some kind of a celebration
maybe not every year i don't know if we
need to add a holiday
but we need one good celebration
in this country anyway to acknowledge
what the hell we just did and are doing
here's my take on it as of today
i feel we won i feel like the war is
over
now it's not over way more work to do
right
but it feels like the kind of work
that's more like the marshall plan
i feel like we're you know as much in
the recovery phase
as we are in the fighting the war phase
at this point
so i feel like
something amazing has happened
when was the last time the entire world
was on the same page when was the last
time the entire world
had to fight the same battle
even if you took world war ii and you
say well in world war ii
you know the whole world got together no
it didn't no it didn't
the whole world was fighting against
other parts of the world
that was when people were fighting other
people that's what a world war is
people versus people this is the first
time
as far as i know the first time the
entire
humankind has ever joined
in the same side of the same war
can you think of it can you think of
anything like it
i can't in in many ways this is the
greatest thing humanity has ever done
in the sense of it has the communication
tools
you know the the ability to coordinate
as one giant entity
you know i wrote a book called uh god's
debris
years ago i won't give away the central
conceit to the book as lawyers like
us and not lawyers as authors like to
use big words
and i feel as if this was
the year the humanity became
in a small way just sort of glancing it
one entity meaning that
before this year you could say we had
seven billion people and they were just
separate entities yeah some of them
operated as governments and some of them
operated as
organizations but for the most part it
was just seven plus billion
individuals with some rules
and then the pandemic hit and suddenly
every single human was on the same side
yeah we you know we argue with china and
stuff but there's no question that both
china and the united states wanted to
beat the virus once it was out there
so i feel as if something
so big has happened that you can't see
it
because that could happen right
sometimes something can be so big
that it's invisible and the thing that
is so big is
that humanity just evolved into another
sentient being
that's how big it is that humanity
became
a new collective
sentient being first time
first time for all of us to be on the
same page
and you know of course there are
exceptions or people who never even
heard of the virus
living in uncontacted tribes and whatnot
but
but largely largely
we just became a one entity and
will they have lasting benefits i think
so think of all the medical community
people who now know each other
especially in the virology world
who now have met each other and shared
techniques and tools now have an open
channel to each other than never had it
before
right humanity
you're starting to compete with god
you've got elon musk literally getting
ready to put people
on mars what do you think we're going to
do when we get there
we're gonna terraform it
eventually now i don't know that you
know elon musk
has any specific plan for terraforming
mars
but it's gonna happen it's gonna happen
humans have reached the point
where we can turn a planet into a
different planet
think about it that's that's completely
within our
scope of probability it's not even just
a possibility it's a probability at this
point
the humans will terraform another planet
maybe in your lifetime the beginning of
it
so we have evolved into almost a
god-like
not equal to god but you know in some of
the
lesser abilities almost god-like
and believe it or not i'm not stoned i
see somebody asking in the
in the comments no no i'm not i know
it's amazing too optimistic
now i know some of you are on the the
opposite page you're saying to yourself
my god that's not what happened 1984
came early
the big powers that be have all
coordinated to give us this fake
pandemic they say
and the real reason is to consolidate
power
no it isn't no it isn't
none of that happened there there was no
meeting
where where like uh shadowy figures got
together and said if we
if we release this pandemic and handle
it a certain way
uh we'll get we'll concentrate all the
power in our hands
that didn't happen that didn't happen
and uh but a lot of people will believe
it happen
along those lines i've decided that
there's a great
need that needs to be filled and i think
i'm going to start filling it
it goes like this you've heard me say
before
that defense attorneys especially the
ones who are defending people
you're pretty sure are guilty are not
really serving just the client
a defense attorney is serving the public
because the public has a
tremendous need to know that trials are
fair
and that the the accused gets like the
most aggressive defense they could
possibly have
because you want that when you get
accused of something right
so when we like to hate the lawyers that
take the case
of somebody who's heinous you know a
serial killer and
you know who's going to defend oj so you
want to hate those lawyers for being
like on the side of evil
but they're not they're exactly the
opposite of that
they're on your side because if you
don't have those aggressive
defense lawyers you don't have anything
you don't have
anything if you get rid of them the
whole system is gone
right but look what's happened recently
we used to have the judicial system
which would be the only place you
could go to to be judged and then
a penalty assessed if you were
judged guilty but that's changed
now the judicial system is only one of
the places
that you can be judged for your alleged
crime
and punished it's only one of the places
now
the other place is in public opinion
because our social media and our
communications are so good now
we we've developed almost a shadow court
where you can be uh you can be charged
like dr seuss dr seuss is being charged
of
basically a crime against humanity
in you know even what's the word when
you're tried after you're dead
what's the fancy word for that put it in
the comments so i can remember it
and if he were alive he would be
penalized
right now what is it that
the judicial system has that this new
system that just
evolved this shadow court of public
opinion
what does it not have as a system i'll
tell you what it
doesn't have suppose you're accused of
something horrible
and let's say there's a big article
about it in some major publication
and you don't personally have a lot of
twitter followers you don't personally
write from a national magazine and maybe
if they even had you on they'd only give
you one minute if you went on tv
so you can't really defend yourself you
are completely defenseless
if you are if you don't have your own
platform now somebody like trump
can just create his own platform
everything he says
gets attention but the rest of you can't
how do you create your own platform and
defend yourself
against being uh accused tried
convicted and penalized losing your job
losing your friends losing your
reputation
what the hell do you do well i'll tell
you one thing that's missing in the
process
a defense lawyer where's the defense
lawyer
right once you're accused it's sort of
the end of the story
because you don't have recourse and so
i've decided that in some cases i can't
do
a lot of them i'm going to be that
defense lawyer
so i'm going to pick people who have
been accused of
heinous things and
i don't know how many of these i can do
but i'm going to
essentially act as the defense i'll have
them on as a guest
and i'll give them a non-limited time
to give me their side of the story i'll
push them as hard as i can
right it's not my job to i'm not going
to try to redeem people
right i'm not trying to fix them i'm
just going to give them
a voice because right now there's no
defense lawyer
and part of the reason there can be no
defense lawyer in the in the public
realm
is that being the defense lawyer would
ruin you as well
right your life your career your your
job all of it would be at risk
if you were to publicly defend somebody
who's accused of something
terrible so i'm gonna do it
because you know what if i if i get
accused of heinous things by defending
or somebody will think i'm defending
rather i'm just giving them a voice
uh if i'm accused of all those things
 everybody
 all of you i'm gonna do whatever i
want
and uh you're just gonna have to deal
with it so i'm in a unique situation
in which i'm hard to cancel i am
cancelable
i'm very cancelable but i'm a little bit
hard to cancel
and it it creates sort of a spiderman
problem
do you know what the spider-man problem
is spider-man famously says in one of
his movies
with great power comes great
responsibility
now it's not that i have great power but
i do have a
let's say a sort of a special
uh i don't want to call myself special
but
but the place i occupy is special
meaning that i can just get away with
more stuff that you can get away with
because i don't have the same penalty
problem so i feel as if i have to do it
i i feel like it's it's like this uh
this magnetic call that's saying okay
you know you
you can do this so you have to do you
get that
have you ever felt that that you're the
only one who can
see you have to right it's like there's
a
fiery wreck on the highway and the the
car is on fire and everybody stops and
they want to help
but everybody's afraid except one person
always in a pickup truck you don't have
to like this
but the one person who saves you usually
arrives in a pickup truck
i don't know why i'm not saying that
this would hold in all cases i'm just
saying
if somebody's going to save your damn
life
and you're and you're in a lot of
trouble the person who's going to save
your life
probably will arrive in a pickup truck
i'm just saying you you can interpret
that any way you want it's just true
they're going to probably arrive in a
pickup truck and one of those people
is going to say i will reach in that
truck and pull that person out
and i'll get you know third degree burns
and stuff but
i'll do that and the reason they will do
it is that they know they can
that's the only reason a bunch of people
show up
and everybody's afraid to reach into the
burning wreck and there's one person who
says i'll do it
and they have to they have to because
they can
that's it they're we're sort of built
that way you have to help if you can
so i didn't pick this place but i'm
going to be uh
defending some people that maybe you
wish i hadn't
okay so i'm going to be setting this up
and
as we go but we'll we'll bring a voice
to the people who
uh are most let's say most controversial
and we'll see where that goes all right
uh
now i tried it out a little bit with uh
i talked to nikki klein most of you saw
that interview
uh she was associated with the nexium
what people call a cult but they didn't
call a cult
and i thought that that went well that
was well received so i think i want to
do more of
that kind of thing all right
um here's the most
fun hypothesis speculation
i've seen all day christopher hill
tweeted this he's a good follow
you should follow him on twitter
christopher hill anyway
he tweeted a meme that shows a path
for trump to win the presidency
but it's way more fun than just running
in 2024 are you ready
all right follow this path and tell me
which part could not happen
all right is this something he could
easily do
tell me what wouldn't work on the
following
number one trump runs for the senate in
2022
from florida could he win
i don't even know who else would be
running right but could so here's the
first part could trump win the senate if
he ran in 2022.
i feel i feel yes i feel yes especially
in florida right
so that part seems practical i'm not
saying he would do this this is just for
fun
next if he had lots of coattails
because we saw that when trump was
was supporting other candidates they won
almost every time
so could trump based on let's say
whatever
bad job we think biden does between now
and then
and and the congress of course looks
like a bunch of animals at this point
could he win enough
bring enough people with him with his
coattails that the
republicans could take back congress and
the senate i mean congress do you think
he could do that
he kind of could i think he kind of
could
now everything depends on how well biden
does between now and then
but imagine a world in which biden
continues to fail
the things that biden does end up having
to be
the same thing trump did or it doesn't
work
right so take immigration and kids in
cages
biden either has to end up doing the
same thing trump did
or he has to fail
what are what are his other choices
right
so every time biden is in that situation
where he
either has to do what trump did or fail
he's just going to look worse and worse
as as trump will look better and better
so yeah i think it is actually possible
that trump could and again i don't think
he'll do this it's just fun to talk
about
he could run for senate he could win in
florida and he could have enough
coattails
he might actually flip the whole the
whole house
and the senate that's how that could do
it gets better
you want to hear the good part and then
trump becomes speaker of the house
you feel it yet and then trump becomes
speaker of the house
and takes nancy pelosi's job
i'm not done wait i'm not done
have i said anything yet that you can't
imagine happening
now again i don't think it'll happen but
is any part of this impossible it really
isn't is it
right it gets it gets better now trump's
the speaker of the house
and then he leads the impeachment
against harrison biden for promoting the
fine people hoax
and we know that uh votes for
impeachment just follow
party lines so it wouldn't matter if
that was a good case a bad case it
wouldn't matter if you think anybody
should be impeached for any of that
it would only matter how many
republicans there are
and if they decide to impeach both
harris and biden and by the way this is
fully impeachable
the fine people hoax is a very
impeachable offense in my opinion
it drives the country apart i mean it's
just the worst thing that's ever
happened in this country in my opinion
that was done intentionally anyway um
so now let's say he he impeaches
successfully biden and harris
who's the president
[Laughter]
that's right the speaker of the house
becomes the president if both the
president and the vice president are
impeached
trump would take the last two years of
biden's term
i'm not done yet i'm not done yet
and then in 2024 he runs for president
now again i don't think this is going to
happen and the main reason i don't think
it's going to happen
is i can't see trump running for a
lesser office as funny as it would be
i can't see him doing it and being a
senator is sort of a
it's sort of a it's less fun
than being president right so i can't
see trump doing it
but the fact that this path even exists
the fact that it even could happen is so
delicious
that i almost can't stand it all right
um i'm going to talk about uh some stuff
that will probably get me canceled
next are you ready this next topic
people get cancelled for even mentioning
it
so you may never see me again
and i'd like to begin by begging
to the gods of social media please
do not misinterpret what i say next
please let me
remain a vital part of the
social media platforms let me
let me exist please don't cancel me
um i'm going to quote again rasmussen i
told you you should follow them
they're making all kinds of news today
and they're tweeting a
story in one of a georgia local
publication
that says the following and before i
tell you this
have i mentioned that the courts
have found no proof of
widespread voter fraud
hear that hear that as clearly as you
can the courts have found
no proof no proof
of widespread widespread
voter fraud so let's all agree on that
that's just a fact don't cancel me don't
cancel me
[Laughter]
and so i give you the following fact as
reported
by rasmussen in a tweet
and there's a publication that reports
it uh
that georgia's chain of custody for the
votes the mail-in votes
is missing over four hundred thousand
million ballots
for georgia and then georgia
um the ballot transfer forms and they
show you the
the chain of custody so there's some
forms that need to be filled out
as part of the normal process of voting
in georgia
and what percentage of the mail-in
ballots
by the way i think georgia was won by
only 12 000 votes
so the the margin of difference in
georgia was 12 000 votes
but there are over 400 000 votes
where the chain of custody is missing
according to this publication
and the ballot transfer
forms show 78
of 89 000 absentee ballots from
dropboxes
were not transported to the registrar
quote immediately
as election code rules require
now i don't know what immediately
requires like what would it immediately
mean
i would say immediately would be within
24 hours
maybe if that feels immediate to me
um so we have two
alleged i'm not saying this
it's not me i'm just saying what other
people are allergic please don't cancel
me
um
what do you think of that now who's
working on fixing this
who's the politician who says well you
can argue about what happened but we've
already moved on
biden is your president but we'll fix it
for next time
we're not saying there was any fraud
we're just saying that there's a
transparency problem
who's working on that which which one of
our uh
important uh national or even state
politicians is working on fixing this
nobody nobody
not even trying if you thought we had a
real election
we didn't there was not transparency
without transparency
you didn't have an election does that
get me canceled
let me say it again if you don't have
transparency
in the election process you only think
you had an election
you didn't have a election you
had one you think you had
and that's it if there's no transparency
or insufficient transparency so
um i do agree that biden's president the
system has
installed him that should not change
through any anything other than a vote
or impeachment i suppose
but uh how do you ignore this
i don't know um
tom peters who you may know as one of
the most
famous business management gurus in the
world
had this to say about bernie sanders i
guess tom peters has lived in vermont
for a long time
or he used to he said speaking as a
former long-term vermonter
ho-hum bernie has never proposed
anything that is doable
as if my departure from vermont bernie
had accomplished
zero in his career other than to be in
favor of quote good things
and i think to myself i don't think
that's an unfair statement
that he's never done anything except
propose things that can't be done
now what's the difference between bernie
proposing things that can't be done
versus trump
proposing things that can't be done do
you know what the difference is
trump doesn't both trump and bernie have
the same quality
they both propose things that can't be
done
the difference is that trump doesn't
vaccinations you can't do that in less
than 18
oh okay i guess you did it right
getting some kind of a peace with north
korea are you kidding me you can't have
a
any kind of uh stability or friendship
with north
oh oh he did it
you can't possibly have a trade war with
china
and you know expect that anything good
oh trump did it
he did it so that's a pretty big
difference isn't it
they both promised the impossible but
one does it
now i know you hate this topic but i
always i have to throw aoc in here
because she's one of the few interesting
people to watch these days
aoc is she is she bernie promising
things that
really can't be done that won't be done
or
or is she trump
now she hasn't been in a position where
she can do the impossible she's
recommending the impossible
but suppose she were in a position to do
the impossible
could she do it trump did
bernie didn't how do you know
well i would not say it's it's any way
obvious that she could pull off the
impossible
i'm just saying it's hard to tell isn't
it sometimes you don't know who can do
the impossible
um but that's an open question all right
the other favorite story of the day is
that uh watching the this will be my
segment
democrats eat their own so i guess last
night bill maher
had charlemagne the god on
and you would see both of them as
associated with the left
right and i guess they were arguing uh
on the show about which of these
democratic
leaders is more rapey um was it
joe biden who was accused of worse
sexual offenses or is it
uh andrew cuomo and
to watch to i would i don't think you
could call
bill maher a democrat exactly but at
least in policy and
philos philosophy he's more aligned i
think
at least lately but watching these two
sort of big names in that space arguing
about which
democrat was more of a rapist or more
sexually
inappropriate not you know i'm
exaggerating with the rape claim
it kind of tells you where things are
going doesn't it
and um
so this is happening in the context of
you know dr
seuss getting cancelled the trump
vaccinations
saving the world and you know iran is
heating up and
if you see if you see bill maher and
charlemagne the god
arguing about which democrat is more of
a sexual abuser
do you really think trump can't win in
2024
because as long as tr as long as trump
stays sort of uh on the sideline but in
our minds you know these these little
press releases he puts out
hit pieces on karl rove and you know hit
piece on this or that
are kind of effective because it keeps
him in the news
but he's not making mistakes because
he's not in office right
you don't have as much to criticize when
somebody's not in office
so i feel as if trump just has to sort
of rope a dope
you know let let the other side punch
itself out so to speak
and he just has to walk into the job now
health of course would be the big thing
and let me say as as clearly as i can so
that
i have some credibility here i don't
think we should have presidents of that
age
i don't think trump should be president
at that age
and i don't think biden should be
president at this age
it's just too old and there's no way
around that
right now i'm going to reserve
a decision about whether trump should be
president
in 2024 because i think every month that
goes by
you have a better read on his health so
if it's a month before election day 2024
i'm going to be looking really hard at
whether trump it looks like he's still
operating
at peak performance or at least whatever
the peak was for
the first administration and if it's not
there
i don't know i i'm i don't think i can
back somebody who's mentally degraded
if that happens i don't think it's
happened but
if it happens i think you got to take
that into consideration
so as i said with the vaccination my own
decision will wait as long as possible
and let me ask you this do you remember
you were told
that the vaccination would have side
effects
and that you might have some flu-like
symptoms
you might feel achy and have a terrible
day for
maybe a day or so remember you heard
that
and now uh millions of people have been
vaccinated
how many news reports have you heard
of people having a hard time with the
side effects of the vaccination itself
it feels like there's a news blackout
doesn't it
doesn't it because even the people who
made the vaccination said
there's going to be a whole bunch of
side effects and it's going to be
unpleasant
where's that in the news i know
i know personally somebody who had a
really hard time with it
now of course he's happy you got it
right it's somebody who definitely
should have the shot
he had a hard day or a half but he's
certainly happy he got it
right now he's protected 90 million
people vaccinated
and the news is just silent
both the left and the right they're just
silent on whether
people are having a hard time with it is
that good
well if you were to look at it as is the
media
in charge of the country you'd say that
maybe that's good leadership
because you want people to get the shot
if they have a bad day they have a bad
day
right that's just the cost of getting to
the other side of this
but you would imagine that if it were
reported more aggressively
that fewer people would get the shots
right
so is the news intentionally managing
what we think about the shot
for the public good and i'm not even
sure what i think about that
would you be mad at your news
organizations
if they decided to help save the world
by
under reporting this thing that doesn't
make much difference
you know the side effects it doesn't
make much difference but if they
reported it honestly fewer people would
get the shot that's just the fact
right it feels like we're being managed
doesn't it
it feels very much like both the left
and the right news
have decided that they just don't want
to talk about that
because it wouldn't be good for the
world to do it
maybe or maybe the side effects are not
nearly as bad as we thought
which one is it
somebody says take ibuprofen after the
second shot
i don't know if that's a medical advice
so don't don't take that as medical
advice i'm just reading a comment
all right um
so here's a story
why don't you see if you can judge
whether this is real news or fake news
this comes from the daily mail british
publication
they say that back in 2012 a north
carolina
man hid a 10-inch revolver in his rectum
after being booked into jail he even
passed a squat and cough test
do you believe that in nine then in 2012
a a man who was booked into jail had hid
a 10-inch revolver handle and all
in his rectum now i assume it was loaded
because it would be hard to smuggle
bullets into jail
so you'd want to load it but here's my
advice to the next
the next prison doctor who does or guard
or whatever
who asked somebody to do a squat and
cough test
during the cough stand to the side
because i feel like the cough could fire
the gun
now imagine if it did
imagine if the guy you know i guess they
make you
strip and bend over and cough to show
that there's nothing back there
but what if the gun fired
could he escape from prison by running
down the hall
and whenever there a guard came after
him
he could quickly drop his pants turn
around
bend over cough shoot the guard
with the bullet that comes out of his
rectum and then
pull up his pants and then run to the
next rex doorway
i don't want anybody to be shot
i'm just saying that if he had
escaped from prison by coughing and
shooting bullets out of his rectum
it would be the greatest story ever told
that's all i'm saying don't want it to
happen
i don't want a criminal to escape i
don't want anybody to be shot
but if it had happened greatest story
ever told i think you'd agree
i think you'd agree it's a movie that
needs to be made
if this isn't a uh
if uh if what's his name carrie
uh if he doesn't make this movie
it's a waste a waste of talent
and there's a story about uh kirsten
cinema that nobody cares about
so we'll skip that all right um
i believe that i've said most of what i
want to say
and the only thing i want to say next is
this
many of you also follow me on the locals
platform
uh somebody says this sounds like a dr
seuss book
what would be the title of the dr seuss
book about the guy who escaped from
prison
by shooting bullets out of his rectum
i would say brown bullets and ham
i don't know can you come up with a
better one
top that i'm a professional so
it's gonna be hard to top that i know
brown bullets and ham
no brown bullets and spam brown bullets
and spam
jim carrey thank you yes jim carrey
should do the movie about the guy who
escapes from prison
with a 10-inch uh revolver
and here's the other i didn't even catch
this the first time i read it
the other part is that it's a revolver
it's funnier than it's a revolver
because that means if he does the cough
and
shoot he can actually feel the revolver
revolving in his stomach like
i didn't think that could get better but
it did
all right um i have a question for you
i've told you that what i'm going to try
to do with these live streams and
more so with the subscription service on
locals
locals.com where people in my community
get to see stuff that they don't get to
see here
if you were if you were on locals
are you getting your money's worth so
that's
that's the question are you getting your
money's worth in terms specifically not
in terms of entertainment
because i don't do it just for
entertainment uh do you get your are you
getting your money's worth
on the subscription service locals
people who follow me
in terms of life
uh let's say building your talent stack
and improving your life skills
and it'll take me a moment to uh
to see this okay i'm saying lots of yes
um because every now and then i need to
check in on that since my proposition is
that it's supposed to be helpful to you
i don't want to guess if it's helpful oh
good
i'm seeing almost all yeses uh
i say i see one now but that might have
been to another question i don't know
all right so for those of you who are
following locals the benefit i hope you
will get will be the micro
lessons that i put there each of those
is designed
that within you know two to five to
minutes usually in two to five minutes
you would add something to your talent
stack
that wasn't there before or reinforce
something that needed it and the idea is
that everybody watches beyond locals
will become more happy and successful
and i wish there were a way to measure
that i'll bet if you measure
the life outcomes of the people who
follow me on locals
compared to the general public that the
graph would be completely different
because just the feedback i get from
people
they're saying it's changing their lives
people losing
45 pounds people you know
people getting twice as much income
people falling in love
all kinds of stuff so uh check out the
other comments if you're wondering if
it's
worth it of course everybody has a
different reaction
but it looks like overwhelmingly the
people who are staying on that service
are happy all right um
that's all i got for today and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
right youtubers you've got me for uh
so you're asking what the bleep happened
to gutfeld
what do you mean i don't think anything
happened to him
um yes the local subscription is seven
dollars a month
i think the platform will be looking to
group subscriptions so you can subscribe
to more than one person
affordably
uh somebody's saying you said a few
weeks ago that trump could never be
re-elected to change your mind
yes yes changed my mind it's amazing how
easily you forget
that whatever the size of the uh the
drama for that week
is that you'll forget it in three weeks
so the the capital assault
i've already kind of forgotten and if
you're talking about
three four years from now it's just not
going to matter at all
what will matter totally is how biden
harris did
you know biden's mental capacity that
sort of thing
so if if trump stays healthy
and he and he doesn't have any
competition
except the ones we know now yeah he
could win
but i would say uh the country
would be far better off if some
more if some capable politician
emerged who could get elected who was
younger
but i don't see it happening who who do
you see emerging
who could beat trump in 2024
if you see somebody emerging then i'll
revise my opinion
but as long as he's not really he's not
competing against anybody
at the moment there's nobody in his
class he is absolutely alone
in his class wouldn't you say everybody
else you can think of
who is strong as a politician
they're still they're still in the the
they're they're not even in the same
layer as trump is not even close
and i've never seen that before have you
and you don't realize how big that gap
is until you see trump
talking in public again every sudden
every time you see him talking in public
even though he's violating the
fact-checking like crazy
there's something extra going on
that is undeniable there's just
something extra that he brings that
nobody else has
yeah desantis desantis is
doing a great job as a manager
and i hate to say that because i don't
have anything negative to say about him
whatsoever but when you see somebody
doing a good job as a manager
it doesn't feel the same as a leader
does it right because the things that
desantis did
that worked were just really good
sort of ceo decisions you know he did
extra good on protecting old people
he was right about how much the
closing the businesses made a difference
so he was
right on a bunch of stuff but he was
right kind of like a manager
uh he's sort of in that gray area there
i just don't know if he has that
that x factor he seems
he seems like the best the best
manager you've ever hired
but i don't know if he can if he can
define himself as
a little higher level than that that
would be the challenge
but i have nothing negative to say about
him could he be a good president i'll
bet he could
you know bet he could in fact i would
say that of
at least a dozen different people you
could give me a dozen different names
that i would say yeah
that could be a good present rand paul
yeah yeah he could be a good president
tom cotton yes he could be a good
president
but would they win all right that's all
i got for today and i'll talk to you
