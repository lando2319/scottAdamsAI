quite the
show you all came to the right place
come on stream in here and get
ready soon as I got my comments
working you can have the show of all
shows the best thing that ever happened
to
you all right
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and there's never been a
better time in the history of the entire
universe and that's about 14 billion
years as far as we know but if you'd
like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can understand with
their tiny shiny human brains all you
need is a cuper mugg or glass a tanker
chals or skin a Stein a canteen jugg or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine the other the day the thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous siping happens now
go how much better do you feel after the
simultaneous
sip
well I can't hear you so I'm going to to
rely on science yes there's more science
about coffee yeah more science so now
the science suggests that it uh drinking
coffee can uh improve your uh depression
so it can decrease depression it can
lower your risk of
suicide uh personally I feel like living
a little bit longer because of that
zip and uh it turns out that people
thought that coffee was maybe bad for
your heart or your blood
pressure but uh there's no long-term
negative turns out might be good for
your heart might lower your risk of
Parkinson's
disease and um just generally is good
for you in every possible way helps you
exercise more is there anything coffee
can't do no no there's nothing it can't
do that's called science and it's called
recreational science because when
science agrees with what I'm already
doing I call that accurate that's called
accurate science when the science tells
me to do something that I don't feel
like doing I call that H kind of
questionable I think we're going to need
further study on this
issue well there's more science that
shows their thinking
hurts well again
and maybe you hear this tooo often but
they could have saved a little bit of
money on this one if they had said
instead of spending whatever they spent
on the study if they'd simply DM me and
said Scott we're thinking of doing a
study does thinking hurt and I would say
oh don't do that study save your money
this one's free it does it hurts that's
why people don't do it it hurts so yes
believe it or not when people try to do
complicated things that require a lot of
thinking they uh they don't like it
because it
hurts now I would like to introduce A
New Concept based on this if the
assuming the science has any validity to
it have you ever noticed that there's
something interesting about Elon Musk
besides the fact that he seems to be
unusually
smart the other thing that really sticks
out is that he seems to have a high
tolerance for pain have you ever noticed
that he has one of the highest pain
tolerances I've ever seen you know so
his famous stories of not sleeping you
know sleeping in the office and this uh
all day long and working all day and
doing crazy hours and taking on all the
abuse from you know the critics and
everything
else um and so it makes me
wonder if you were going to evaluate
somebody's practical
intelligence their practical
intelligence it wouldn't be just their
genetic ability to think it would also
be their willingness to take on
pain literally meaning that it wouldn't
matter if your brain was awesome if you
didn't like the pain of thinking because
even if you're smart whatever you're
thinking about's going to challenge you
in a in a in a discomfort kind of a way
so my observ is that maybe what makes
Elon Musk more effective than other
people who maybe on paper would be
almost as smart is that he just has a
high pain tolerance and you you see it
in everything he does it seems to be
pervasive across all elements of his
activities I would say that I have that
going for me as
well um I don't have a high pain
tolerance for physical pain don't like
that at all I'm not a fan of physical
pain whatsoever but I have noticed that
I can handle more mental pain than the
average person so I think that helps me
I think it makes my whatever genetic
intelligence I have I think I can take
it further than other people because I
can handle more pain of that specific
nature anyway bright Bart has a big
story about the Shroud of Turin you know
the the burial sheet that allegedly
Jesus was wrapped up in after
crucifixion well uh Dylan Gwyn is
writing in
brart that uh scientists have figured
out that uh it might in fact the Garment
anyway might in fact be dated back to
the actual time of Jesus now the people
who had debunked this sheet being
related to the actual historical Jesus
um they debunked it because they did a
uh
uh their standard uh testing carbon
dating and they found out it was not
nearly old enough so when they carbon
dated the do the uh material the
scientists and this has been you know
I've I've known this to be true for
decades so for several decades it was
true that this was a hoax because the
Garment was not nearly old enough well
now researchers have used a different
method of dating it so rather than doing
carbon dating they uh use some kind of a
microscope and looked at the looked at
the details of it the fabric and then
they compared it to other known
Fabrics so they looked at things where
they knew they could date the fabric to
a certain time then they looked under a
microscope and said hey this looks like
the Fabrics from this time based on
whatever you know micro elements are in
there and they concluded that the carbon
dating of the uh of the cloth was
flawed now if you think this is a story
about whether Jesus is real it's
not I I don't have an opinion on that
and that's not what I'm I'm interested
in I mean it's interesting but I
wouldn't say that Jesus is or is not
real based on a piece of cloth so so the
question of whether Jesus is real
that's not part of the story right
that's just a separate story but did the
science the the part that interests me
is the science had misdated this for
decades allegedly now the people who
used the carbon dating may say that
theirs is right
but has anybody ever doubted that carbon
dating is
accurate if any of you ever
said how do they know it's accurate
how do you
know now the specific complaint with
this um this garment is that it had U it
was basically had too many uh pollutants
in it it' been it it wasn't a pure
carbon dating experiment so perhaps if
you're looking at a rock or a fossil you
might be more confident that nothing
polluted your experiment to date it so
the thinking is there was something
special about this government that made
the carbon dating not
work but we didn't know that for
decades if this is right now the other
question is is the new information right
I don't
know all I would like to introduce is
the idea that no matter how sure you are
that the scientists use their magic
tools there's still a lot of assumptions
going into this stuff and that data is
all made
up you know I've been saying this it
sounds
hyperbolic and it is but I I need you to
get closer to the idea that 100% of the
things you see in the news and 100% of
the things you see from science no
matter how credible that scientific
entity
is you should assume it's not
true now if later there's more
confirmation blah blah blah or if you
just have to make a pick because it's
one of those situations where you can't
just ignore the situation you got to
make a choice you know like with in the
pandemic you had to make a choice you
you didn't have the luxury of knowing
for sure you just had to take a
choice but uh just don't assume
automatically that anything you hear in
the news or from science is correct not
automatically it might be you should
take it seriously so you should
definitely take it seriously but don't
assume it's true because it came from
experts
meanwhile the University of Kentucky is
deand is disbanding their Dei
office because Republican lawmakers were
pushing some anti- Dei legislation so
they said to themselves well if there's
going to be anti- Dei legislation let's
get ahead of it and get rid of our Dei
office so that's a victory right I saw
some people in social media saying yes
it's a victory we want to get rid of
that Dei and we got rid of it well
there's some uh little extra you you
should know about this story number one
it's being reported by the
AP so how's your credibility rating if
it comes from the Associated
Press do you automatically think it's
true automatically think there might be
some context
missing or automatically think it might
be fake what do you think well the AP
wouldn't be on the top of my list of
reliable sources especially for anything
political but it did say to its credit
the AP did report that there would be no
job
loss way what they have a Dei department
and they're getting rid of the
function but there's no job loss because
the people in those jobs are being
folded into other
departments you know what's missing in
this
story the employees that were doing Dei
that will not lose their jobs but be
folded into other
departments to do what are they being
retrained for new
jobs or are they going to do their same
 job and they're just going to
get rid of the words Dei and just do it
from within a different
department the story doesn't tell
you that's the main thing the the main
point of the story is are they still
going to do this what I would consider
illegal Dei stuff or did they say oops
you caught us we're not going to do it
anymore you can't tell the story is
completely ambiguous about whether they
did or did not decide to get rid of
their
Dei I'm a little suspicious and so my
guess is that they just changed the
names and they're going to keep it
that's what I think what do you
think but it's in the news
[Music]
so it's in the news so I don't study it
we will talk about the DNC I'm just
warming you
up there's a another study by the the
medical Express is talking about this
that finds that young people
surprisingly are very influenced by
experts and although they are of course
influenced by influencers on social
media the good news that's reported is
that young people are more likely to
believe an
expert than some random influencer even
if they follow them on social media so
that's great news isn't it oh phw so
happy that young people will get their
knowledge from experts and not from
influencers that's all good
right
well let me give you a little lesson on
brainwashing
now if you're new to my lessons on
brainwashing I come from it from the
perspective of being a trained and
experienced hypnotist who writes about
persuasion all the time so it's my main
domain outside of cartooning I guess and
here's a brainwashing professional
tip if you can convince the public that
the news is
real and you can convince the public
that experts are usually
right then you can convince the public
of
anything let me say it again if the
public believes the news is usually true
and if the public believes the experts
as reported by the news are usually
right then they can brainwash you on any
topic instantly how do they do it they
just find an expert who who may or may
not be telling the truth to go on the
news CU then you've got an expert and
you've got the news and people will say
well those are two things that boost The
credibility obviously the news looked
into whether it's true or not before
putting it on I mean of course they're
going to make sure it's true you know
they're going to check with people
they're not going to put a bunch of BS
on so if the news put it on it must be
true and then the experts talking and if
the experts there and you don't hear
another expert you only get that one
expert or maybe a few experts on the
same side you say well the experts say
it the news of course checked it so it
must be true this is now my belief
forever now you add to that the siloing
of the news so that if you're on one
side of the news you only see your news
and you never see any other expert or
any other news you're now done that is a
100% bulletproof brainwashing machine
all the government has to do or the
Democrats is find anybody who can say
they're an expert and put it on the
news that's all the brainwashing there's
nothing else you need to do there's
nothing else you need to do there's no
extra step you just find an expert put
it on the news so we have a brainwashing
system that is really effective now I
don't think it's much different in other
countries but wow is this bulletproof
there's nothing you can do about this by
the way there's no defense against this
this is 100% bulletproof
brainwashing and it
works which doesn't mean that 100% of
things that are on the news from experts
is false just to make that clear doesn't
mean 100% is false it just means you're
always getting a version a narrative a a
propaganda biased version that's always
true but sometimes it might even be
accurate well how about is a
brainwashing well PolitiFact that's a
factchecking organization and somebody
called capital B I have no idea who they
are they've announced an election year
partnership to counter political
misinformation aimed at black
audiences so if you didn't know anything
about how anything Works what would you
say about this
let's say you saw it on the
news well you'd say huh that sounds like
a good thing because you don't want the
black Americans to be lied to nobody
wants that uh and so you've got two
entities who you don't know much about
but they're probably experts right I
mean you wouldn't have a group called
PolitiFact checking facts unless they
were some pretty good factchecking
experts you know what I mean so you got
some experts and then I read about it on
the news well so it must be true it must
be true that there's a misinformation
and they're going to clear it
up or if you know anything about how
everything works the the fact Checkers
are almost always fake literally just
fake and they're part of the
brainwashing
operation
always it might be you know on one side
versus the other but pretty much they're
in the bag now let me call out Snopes as
being recently a an exception to that
rule Snopes did in fact finally debunk
the fine people hoax the biggest most
dangerous hoax in American history and
so at least they're showing some
Independence I think that's worth
calling out I don't know why don't know
why it took so
long but it worth it's worth calling it
out as a sign of
Independence meanwhile the US birth hit
a new low so according to the CDC it's
reported in the
hill and I saw an interesting point of
view about this I wish I had written
down who said it it's just something I
saw on the internet and I saw Elon Musk
agreeing with it so forgive me for
whoever the smart person is who said
this before I said it so this is not my
original
observation but it goes like
this if you have have children you
immediately start thinking everything
about the
future now how many of you have had that
experience so if you have biological
children you just start thinking about
their future it's all just future
thinking because you're trying to take
care of your Offspring but if you're
single you're a little bit more living
in the moment it's like hey what do I
want
today now I that sounds right to me now
here's the risk the risk is that if
enough people are
single individually that might sound
like a perfectly reasonable choice in
our free Society not everybody should
have kids probably you know so so if
you're looking at it as just Freedom
it's like okay good we got more options
more
freedom but what would happen if 40% of
your public stopped planning for the
future and just plan to get through
their own life well they wouldn't care
about stuff like climate change because
they say what I say which is well I'll
probably be gone before that gets
me now that that's assuming that you
believe that it's a crisis I don't
believe it's a crisis I think it's a
manageable issue that's my personal
belief I wouldn't say that I'm 100%
certain but it does look like there's
some you know man-made
elements and that I think we'll get
through
it but uh forget about climate change CU
that kind of confuses the the whole
argument the argument is would the
United States fail for no reason other
than too many people not caring about
the future and my intuition and I think
Elon Musk as well is
yes yes the risk is not just that you
don't have enough people to create a tax
base to pay for the retirees that's a
big problem but the problem might be how
we think as a
and then how we vote we might not even
vote for the long-term benefit of the
country anymore because we' just be
thinking shorter term so that's sort of
a really big deal that I don't know how
to wait it it just feels like it could
be a big deal that we haven't talked
about anyway over in the UK um I see
Erin sarum from the Free Beacon is
reporting that
apparently uh if you say one of these
things in the ukuk you could go to jail
for quite a long time here are the
things you can't say out loud in the UK
without going to jail actual jail like
actual
jail all right here's one of them it's
okay to be
white
jail I'm not making this up this is
based on actual examples for real people
who went to jail here's another one
reject white
guilt
jail now remember when I said it would
be unsafe for me to travel to the UK do
you believe
me because apparently these the
statements you make are not about things
you're saying today it's about something
you've ever
said what do you think my social media
looks
like do you think there's any chance I
wouldn't be jailed in theuk okay I mean
if they cared if they ignored it I
wouldn't be jailed but if they wanted to
jail me in the UK have I said enough
online that would make me
jailable
yes quite obviously yes let me say it
again it's okay to be white and you
should reject white guilt I embrace
those two messages
100% so UK you
 you very much I'm never going to
come near your country I'll
never go there again I've been there
once and it was not impressive let me
let me just say the food in the UK is
garbage the traffic in London is a
disgrace and the whole place looks like
it's falling apart from Bad management
so no I'm not going to travel to your
 piece of country I'm only
talking about the government now I like
the people people are fine
and uh if I ever have any opportunity to
do business in the UK or to sell any of
my products there I'm going to try to uh
shut that down I don't even want to have
Financial interests even if I benefit
from them in the UK that no I I can't I
just can't have anything to do with your
country it's you're just you're dead to
me basically all right well speaking of
hate speech
um Obama spoke at the
DNC all right uh but also uh here are
some things that Biden said recently so
this is not Obama this is Biden we'll
get we'll get to Obama um he said how
can we be the greatest nation in the
world without the best education in the
system uh system in the
world Donald Trump and the Republican
friends they not only can't think they
can't read very well this is what
this is what Biden said about
Republicans that they can't think and
they can't read very
well and the audience laughed and he he
said seriously think about it look at
their project 2025 which is of course a
hoax uh they want to do away with uh a
part of Education which is not true of
course they're just
lies
but talk about hate speech is it hate
speech to say it's okay to be a certain
demographic white or is it hate speech
to say you shouldn't be guilty just
because the way you were
born that's hate of speech in the UK but
over in America you can have the
president say that half of the country
are
idiots and you know and he identifies
them as you know Republicans and that's
okay that's fine no problem well I do
appreciate that we have free speech so
if if I had to pick one of these systems
I would pick the one where Biden can lie
in front of the public and say anything
he wants about anybody and then we get
to vote so it's ugly it's
messy but I'll take the Free Speech
thank
you anyway um the DNC if you want to if
you want to know how well brainwashing
works there there's a great little
example that somebody pointed out that
uh Bernie uh so Bernie Sanders gives his
speech last night and a lot of it was
you know rich people are bad rich people
are bad do you think people cheered for
that you know the billionaires are
stealing your money rich people are bad
of course they did yeah yay rich people
are bad they should share their money
with the rest of us so then burning gets
done and then um one speaker later JB
priter gets up and starts mocking
Trump's business success and he tells
the crowd that they should take their
advice from a real
billionaire and they clap like oh yeah
the real billionaire yes yes we support
a real billionaire not that fake Trump
billionaire yes yes and and not only is
it real billionaire he's fat we love it
fat billionaires
yes but wait a minute didn't you just
clap for Bernie Sanders who said all the
fat billionaires should be uh boiled
down to render their fat into soap
products okay I may have be exaggerating
about that a little bit and uh it turns
out that it doesn't matter what you tell
the DNC
crowd apparently they're so brainwashed
as long as it comes from their own team
they're all on
board it's like hey everybody we we're
going to start chopping the heads off of
Democrats yes yes it's been so long
since I had my head chopped up
where's the line where can I get in the
line it's really weird to watch that
they'll agree with
anything you know if I watch a uh a
trump
rally I watch people agreeing with
Trump that doesn't seem weird to me even
when I don't agree with maybe the
specific topic it happens sometimes but
it doesn't seem weird because Trump is
typically just offering a common sense
solution to stuff and then people are
saying I like that Common Sense solution
what you don't see is one speaker saying
billionaires are bad another speaker
saying billionaires are good and getting
the same
Applause that's just weird that's creepy
weird to use their
language all right I've got a
hypothesis about all the hoaxing that's
happening at the DNC so you probably
noted that Biden had like six different
hoaxes that have been debunked from
these from the drinking bleach to the
Fine people hoax to the everything else
and then the other you're seeing that
the other speakers are repeating the
debunked the most ridiculous debunked
hoaxes now at first I said to myself oh
how can they be so misinformed or how
could they be lying so badly and you
know to Their audience you know all the
usual reactions you'd have but I'm
starting to think something else is
going on here because the the level of
hoaxing that they did was Way Beyond
anything I expected and here's what I'm
wondering
about is this
intentional do you think that the DNC um
the Wizards the people behind the
curtain who are the real persuasion
experts do you think that it any time
they said something like
this hey Comm Harris's policies are
unclear her track record is not
impressive and we're not letting her
talk to the
Press but it's the political season so
whatever we do the Press is going to be
talking a lot about whatever they have
to talk about can we change what they
talk about to make it less about the
errors that come Harris has and more
about anything
else yes we can we can have our people
do nonstop debunked hoaxes on TV all day
long until the Republicans go crazy
talking to each other and not the
Democrats because remember Democrats
never hear what Republicans say so they
can make the entire
Democrat Silo go crazy which
they have successfully done cuz I watch
it and I like my hair stands I'm like
damn it how can you be pushing the same
hoax a million times in a row and then
they keep doing it and I say to myself
wait a
minute one of your influencers is an
energy
monster do you recognize this
play this play and I'm going to call it
a play or an OP because it looks
intentional to me I don't know I can't
confirm it but as someone who you know
is uh let's say always looking at
persuasion plays the pattern I'm
recognizing is they moved from a talking
you into some truth into an energy model
it's the Trump model the thing that
works so well for Trump is he moves
energy he gets you excited about a thing
and you don't care about the hyperbole
the factchecking so Trump as
consistently won as an energy monster
meaning he can tell you 15 things that
don't pass the factchecking but if
they're directionally true and they get
you excited and it gives you something
to talk about we're all in you know as
long as it's in the right direction I
don't care about the details of whether
passed the fact check too much because
I've noticed it never
matters I I can't think of anything
Trump's ever told me or the
country that was both
wrong and mattered
can you I I can't think of an example
lots of things that I would say Okay
technically that's hyperbole that's not
exactly true but nothing that ever hurt
me it was always the right
direction whereas the Democrats seem to
be playing a different game it does look
like you know actually damaging stuff
like the hoaxes are just so bad it's bad
for division in the
country
so I think that the smartest people on
the Democrat side which are very
smart you you don't want to
underestimate them whoever it is that is
now advising the Harris campaign is at a
different
level all right the the normal level is
hey look at our policies they're better
than your policies that's regular
politics you don't need any Geniuses to
come up with those ideas but whoever
came up with the idea of let us let us
uh flood the Zone with hoaxes and make
the Republicans burn up all their energy
spinning about how these hoaxes are not
true it will use up all of their time
all their space and we know that it will
never reach Democrat
voters and that's what's happening uh I
spent a whole bunch of time debunking
hoaxes and I saw all all of the usual
hoax debunkers who do it with me and and
also just doing it on their own spending
all their time debunking things within
the
silo all that energy is wasted it's all
wasted energy and they did that to me
and I'm thinking okay I'm supposed to be
a little bit clever about this stuff
because I at least I pay attention to
the persuasion things and I think I got
had I feel like they they got me on this
one I'm G to score this I'm going to
score that a win on points for the other
team I think they won this round
and I think it's intentional I can't
prove it I'm not 100% on this but I've
got I've got like a 70 80% confidence
that it's an intentional plan to flood
the Zone with hoaxes that Democrats
think are true or at least
recreationally they think it's true
enough uh to have fun with it and it
just burns off all the Republican energy
debunking it I think that's what's
happening
and is working it's really working
well well the uh apparently uh the
viewership of the DNC is down 22% from
2016 I don't know if that's telling me
anything because I feel like television
watching is probably down 22% since
2016 am I wrong about
that I mean you know normal broadcast
television it's got to be down 22% since
2016 but
um if there's something else going on it
would be uh interesting because that
would say that Hillary Clinton got more
attention than K
Harris maybe I don't know I I wouldn't I
wouldn't put too much weight in the fact
that the viewership is
down well uh you all noticed that the
polls were saying that uh Trump was
going to win like crazy and no body
liked kamla Harris and then suddenly
everybody liked KLA Harris and she's
beating Trump in a lot of polls and you
said to
yourself is the brainwashing that good
did it work that fast that the Democrats
just said oh oh suddenly the worst
candidate we've ever seen couldn't even
make it past the first round in the
primaries is now the best
candidate and our best hope for winning
and blah blah blah and she's great well
here's uh here's the other
possibility
um so uh let's see pollster John mclen
was talking about this was it on just
the news I think it was
um said that there basically the
pollsters just started polling a
disproportionate number of Biden
voters yeah so John mcglaughlin a
pollster said this on just the news the
no noise television show
and uh so mclaughin is saying that all
they do is just over sample Democrats so
if you want your poll to say that that
uh Harris is winning all you have to do
is ask more Democrats than Republicans
who they're going to vote
for think about
that that's all it takes and then the
other pollsters who don't do it there
aren't that many but like rasmon for
example uh rasmon will look at it and
say uh no you oversample Democrats if
you don't oversample the the number is
Trump still
ahead and we'll talk about that um
actually let's talk about it now so
rasmason still has uh Trump up and
rasmason still has the generic
Republican beating the generic Democrat
by a good margin like Five Points um
that's the margin that in 2022 if I
recall correctly that uh rasmason also
had Republicans up by five and they
ended up adding nine seats so the the
current rasmuson poll which is
transparent about uh what percentage of
the public they're polling as Democrats
or Republic now keep in mind you know
I'm not the expert that can tell you
which polls are always accurate I I
don't have that ability but I can tell
what is transparent and rasmason tells
you
exactly their their mix and they say the
other people are gaming the
mix you can look for yourself you know
because even the ones that are gaming it
if you look in the the details it will
show that they gamed it it's just people
don't look at the
details so how could you be sure that
that's what's happening that uh that
the let's say the mainstream Democrat
leaning pollsters are gaming the system
how could you be sure that was true well
one way would be to see if it doesn't
apply to the polls that you don't think
would intentionally game the system so
the ones that uh that do show Trump is
ahead in a two-way race would be Fox
news rasmuson reports and
CNBC and all the other ones show that
Harris is a got a one to four point
lead now if you looked at these polls
Fox News Rasmus and C NBC would you find
any obvious
flaws nobody's mentioned any you know
it's not it's not for me to really know
that but I haven't heard anybody mention
it but certainly certainly rasmuson and
others experts like McLaughlin do point
out that the ones that are pro Harris
are very clearly gamed by oversampling
democrats
so I this isn't one of those situ ations
where you can be 100% sure from the
outside what's going on but it looks
very much like that's what's going on if
I had to bet on it I would bet this is
exactly what's happening that the
polling is fake when they get closer to
the real election all the pollsters will
want to finish close to the
reality in the beginning they don't need
to because you you can't really hold
them to it because you don't know what
the actual answer is in the end but once
it's close to the election
what what you'll find is that all the
pollsters will start pulling the right
number of Democrats and then suddenly
it's going to shrink to look like it's
really
close and I would argue that it's uh too
big of a coincidence that we're always
as close in our elections and if you
were some kind of intelligence unit or
deep State entity that tried to rig an
election the thing you would try the
hardest to do is make sure the election
would look close on Election Day you'd
want it to look as close as possible
that way no matter which way the
election
goes people will say well I didn't know
for sure the other one was going to win
it was so close so I guess I can accept
that it went slightly different than I
expected it's not that different so if
the system is gamed and
rigged you would guarantee if they were
good at it but and if they were good at
it you would guarantee that it would
always be close on Election Day if any
rigging is
planned but we're close right
now um so Comm Harris has proposed a 45%
long-term capital gains tax that'd be
the highest in history and also a 25%
tax on unrealized capital gains for rich
people but nobody believes that they
would keep it for rich people because
once you took all of the rich people's
money it wouldn't come close to paying
off the debt or paying all the things
they wanted you to pay for so they would
test it on the rich people if they get
away with it they'd have a model that
they could start moving down the income
levels so that's what people expect it's
not what she says it's just what
reasonable people expect that it would
get
extended so if you combined uh that 25%
tax with state taxes uh in many states
you'd be taxed over 50% on unrealized
gains unrealized gains now if you're not
a finance person let me explain
this the majority of my current net
wealth is in unrealized
gains meaning that for most of my career
in ear the early part of my career I got
some extra money and just put it in an
index fund 25 years ago now it turns out
if you had some extra money 25 years ago
and you put it in an index fund it was
first of all good for the economy
because my money is in the stock market
that's good for the
economy
but currently since I kind of spent or
donated or invested all of my income
after that I was kind of running on you
know spending it all basically as long
as other people were benefiting families
you know for kids and stuff like that
and
currently probably uh
80% of my net worth or 90% I think 90%
90% of my net worth is unrealized
gains just think about that the
government wants to take half of
it I I worked my entire life with the
specific idea that at this point in my
life most of my net wealth would be un
realized gains and then if I need it
I'll realize gains and spend it and pay
my taxes
so imagine working your whole life and
having the government randomly take half
of it that's the situation I'm
in now uh most of you if you're being
reasonable are saying something like oh
my tiny violin is so sad that you've got
this problem Scott because you know if
you're not rich it just sounds like a
rich guy whining which it is it is a
rich guy whining
but you can't really build a system that
that makes your most productive people
totally screwed you can't have people
who own farms and own businesses and and
have all this unrealized gains in their
real estate Etc you would be wiping out
Boomers pretty hard again once once the
standard gets moved down to lower
incomes and we expect that that would be
a natural
progression so how do people think about
that well Elon mus said this path leads
to breadlines and ugly
shoes breadlines and ugly shoes meaning
communism that's one of the funniest
comments on communism I've heard bread
lines and ugly
shoes now that's persuasive because
nobody wants ugly shoes especially
Democrats all right but here's my
question and to me this is hilarious
Harris still has some
billionaire uh
supporters how could you be a
billionaire and support Harris after she
just said she's going to take you know a
quarter of half of your or half of your
money yeah you know what I would do if I
were a billionaire supporter of Harris
you know what I would
do I would sell my I would sell my uh
NBA team right away
before she gets in
office has anybody done that is there
anybody who's a a major billionaire
supporter of Harris who has recently
sold
their sold their NBA interest so that
they won't have any unrealized gains
when she
becomes oh they have oh apparently
somebody did that oh well that's exactly
what I would do if I knew that was
coming because maybe I knew what the
advisers were telling her I would sell I
I'll tell you if I had an NBA team I'd
sell
that have we heard from Reed
Hoffman uh somebody said I I haven't
confirmed this but somebody said Reed
Hoffman wants to know more about
it how in the world how in the world is
Reed Hoffman GNA go in public and
support this
plan because he knows it's a bad idea of
everybody smart knows it's a bad idea
but it would be extra bad for him
specifically it'd probably take like a
billion dollars from him imagine you
Reed Hoffman and you you putting all
your time and money into this party and
then suddenly they come up with the okay
and um one last thing thank you for all
the help we really appreciate all the
donating you know and uh just one more
thing we kind of need you to
give up a billion
dollars I think that's what he's going
to work for so what would a reasonable
rich person say under these
circumstances well let's let's look at
Jason one of the four people from the
all-in Pod Jason is one of the ones of
the
four who most closely I think identifies
with you more left leaning than
right and he's been for the
Democrats not a trump supporter even
though others you know at least two
people on the Allin pod were Trump
supporters saxs and
jth and uh he said this in a post he
said if K Harris and Tim W go for the
wealth tax on unrealized gains that is a
unconstitutional and B disqualifying for
me
there you
go so here's what I I love about the
all-in
Pod it's not exactly
political they talk about all the
politics so the the topics are political
but the four of them are not really
political they're four super smart
capable people who just understand how
everything works now I think you can be
a super smart capable practical person
and be either a Democrat or
Republican until this year now you can't
do it
anymore now there's no such thing as
being a smart Common Sense well-informed
person and also being a Democrat you
can't do it this year because they're
they're fully into batshit crazy
territory this is not normal Trump as I
often say I can't think of a single
thing he's ever suggested whether
whether I liked it or not you know it's
not I'm not saying I like everything
that Trump's ever suggested but they all
fit into the category of common sense
you maybe you have to dial back some
hyperbole but it it ends up all being
directionally common sense but the stuff
that's coming out of the Democrats are
things that every smart person knows
would ruin the country everyone Reed
Hoffman would know Mark cubin would know
Jason knows they all know it so
if they still you know double down for
their team something else is going on
right now it could be just people don't
like to change their mind in public
could be
that could be something else I don't
know if there's something else is but
it's probably not
good so uh kudos to Jason for
simply being about what makes
sense like I I have complete respect for
that just be about what makes sense and
everybody knows this would be a terrible
terrible
idea all right so here's my take I think
this race unlike any other prior race
we've left the realm of
politics this doesn't feel like a
difference in political opinion to me
where every other race has you know you
got your Republicans you got your
Democrats they've got you know somewhat
different ideas so it's about politics
politics this is not about politics
whatever this is that we're observing is
common sense things like close the
border don't over tax you know don't
don't rape your taxpayers just ordinary
stuff don't get over excited about
climate crisis if the other countries
are not doing their part very basic
stuff common sense and if somebody says
to me but Scott why are you you
registered as a Democrat but supporting
Trump to which I say it has nothing to
do with democrat or republican I I don't
even really think about those things I
just look at well is that a good idea
yes okay I like it is that a good idea
no well okay I'm against it because you
can usually tell what a good idea is you
just look at the
incentives you look at what people have
done before that would be in that vein
that would inform you about the future
stuff it's not hard to know what is
common you know I I mock common sense
because we all imagine we have it but
there are some things that every smart
person will agree on right I've never
seen a smart person argue for keeping
the borders as porous as they are not
really I've never seen that even the
people who are behind it make sure that
they don't comment on it in
public have you ever seen Alex Soros
give an interview about how the current
rate and flow of immigration is a good
idea no no I mean he might be sort of
generally pro-immigrant but everybody
is so no all of the smart people are on
the same side and if you're a public
smart person you're going
first all right Elon Musk is a public
smart person boom Trump
supporter the you know sax and chth are
public smart people boom Trump
supporters bill akman is a public smart
person boom Trump supporter RFK
Jr
maybe you know what RFK Jr is he's a
public smart
person and uh turns out that uh Alex
Jones's reporting he has a source he
says that he believes that RFK Jr will
announce on
Friday and I don't I'm not seeing this
confirmed from other sources so use your
judgment about the reliability of the
reporting but uh he's thinking that on
Friday RFK Jr might throw in with Trump
and you know presumably there would be
some opportunity in the future for him
to work with the administration in some
capacity that would be unnamed
now does that sound uh like that might
happen I don't know let's look at uh
what RFK Jr is
saying
um here's something that RFK Jr said
that is not about this topic but I want
you to listen to how he
talks about this topic and you tell me
does that sound more like somebody who
would be a trump supporter or more like
somebody who would a standard Democrat
supporter right here's RFK Jr recently
quote the co pandemic was used to
fundamentally change the relationship
between US citizens and their government
the government's Public Health response
was not a medical response but instead a
test of technocratic power to see how
the population would respond to
totalitarian edicts masked as medical
intervention the government also
selected the lock down winners and
losers transferring nearly 4 tril ion
dollar of wealth from the middle class
and small business to Silicon Valley and
big box stores there have been no
Corrections and no apologies because the
government wants to be able to do it
again now he says that is why we're
hearing all the hoopla now about the
monkey box and bird flu and yet more
experimental vaccines we cannot let this
happen again we must
resist who's that sound
like now now now Trump has not said this
Trump has not said this but who does it
sound like well it doesn't sound like
Harris it sounds the opposite of
democrat it sounds more like the
Republican Bas it doesn't sound like
Trump because he hasn't said this as
directly as the bass does but the Bas
says this every day the the ordinary
Republicans say exactly EX exactly
exactly this every day is it a
coincidence that RFK Jr you know two
days before Friday comes out with
something that matches perfectly one of
the most emotional important issues to
the Trump
base doesn't look like a
coincidence how about his VP Choice
arcade Jr's V VP Choice Nicole shenan
uh what did she say recently she just
said KLA Harris's economic plans
particular particularly her flawed ideas
about price caps on food and the
misconception that farmers are
responsible for price gouging Echo the
very policies that caused listen to this
Echo the very policies that caused the
famine my family suffered through in
Mouse communist China our path forward
as a nation lies in supporting our
farmers who care for our land and
produce the real nutritious food we rely
on who's that sound like does that sound
like uh KLA Harris talking there no
because she's actually directly saying
that K Harris would turn us into a a
famine ridden death
country does it sound more like
Trump
well yes I mean it does sound more like
Trump but what it sounds even more like
it sounds like more than
Trump is Trump's
base right I mean Trump's Trump's in the
same domain as this idea but this
matches the
base perfectly so what if I told you
about RFK Jr one of the things that
makes him extra
interesting is that I said whether he
agreed with the Republicans or back them
or not I said he fully understands how
they think and feel do you get it now he
fully understands how Republicans think
and feel that doesn't mean he has to
agree with them all the time but he
fully understands how they think and
feel Nicole has you know done her
podcast um I guess you call it
campaigning it's which is good technique
you know she's a single
mom so she's having podcasts and the
people that she invites on her podcast
were people like me so I was on her
podcast so does Nicole understand what
Republicans think and feel even if
sometimes she would disagree with them
and the answer is yes absolutely she's
proven it and she's she she's done it
publicly she talked in person publicly
with a whole bunch of people on the left
and the right so yes she absolutely
knows what Republicans are thinking and
feeling do you want them on your team I
do yes you be on my team
please all
right um I think I had a couple things I
wanted to talk about
first all right so Trump went on the
Theo Von
podcast
um I I guess what's notable about that
is that uh Trump is really the the
perfect podcast guest isn't he when
Trump goes on a news show it's just
combat and the combat is kind of
repetitive and doesn't look fun and
you're fake news and then the fake news
makes him reply to a hoax and then he
says that's a hoax you're fake news I
mean it's all just the same thing but if
he goes on a podcast you don't know
where it's going to go and you you get
to really see the the real person in a
situation that's not scripted Trump is
great I I feel like every time you see
one of these you watch the podcast or
fall in love with him have you noticed
that whenever Trump does a podcast by
the time he's done it's just almost you
can see it like the podcaster doesn't
just enjoy that they had the experience
it's like they fell in love with the
 guy he does have that power he's
got the thing he's got the X Factor and
oh say it for the millionth
time as much as I love seeing him talk
to podcasters especially interesting
ones who are not your traditional ones
I'd love to see him talk to some
Democrats the voters only the
voters but my God how much do you want
to see
that I want to see it so much now I
don't necessarily think he needs to go
on you know Charlamagne the gods podcast
although I give charlot a lot of credit
he's an interesting addition to the
conversation right wherever he goes he's
interesting that's that's all I ask
right I think he's he's in it for the
right reasons as far as I can tell I
mean I think he'd like the country to do
better uh
Etc but I don't think he's the right fit
for Trump I'd rather he talk to just a
regular voter who was just curious and
just say
can you explain why you're in favor of
this and then just have Trump explain it
I would love to watch that I'd watch
that all day
long well according to Liz Harrington so
here's something that I see because I'm
plugged into a certain part of the
internet every single day I see one or
more than one uh reports about credi
looking I don't know how credible they
are but credi looking reports of
confirmed election rigging
now when I say confirmed election
rigging I mean that's what the report
says do I know that it's confirmed I
don't because unfortunately these are
the kind of claims I just look at and go
well I don't know who this person is
they've made some claims I can't check
them I don't know but they sure look
believable I mean they're persuasive as
hell um and there are a lot of them so
here's
one and there's a claim that uh over
6,000 votes were fraudulently inserted
into the Fulton County hand count audit
now if I understand this correctly the
allegation goes like this that the
machine count didn't match the hand
count and since they didn't want to go
public and say uhoh we're way off and
our hand count doesn't match our machine
count allegedly there's evidence I don't
know if it's proof but there's evidence
that what might have happened again I'm
going to say might and I don't know the
credibility of any of these
reports uh that the people doing this uh
this uh true up just double counted some
ballots so that they could have the two
systems
match
now is that
possible could it be as obvious as
somebody did a recount it didn't match
so they just rigged it so it did
match I mean that's really right on the
nose so those are the times I I get a
little suspicious it's a little too
close to too
simple I don't know so I'm going to
say I'm very curious about all of these
claims but it would probably be a huge
mistake to assume that all of them or
even half of them are are going to pan
out but what if some of them do I mean
there's so many you that that laundry
list persuasion thing where if there's
enough on the list your your automatic
common sense says well the list of
claims is so long that even if some of
these are not right there must be some
that are true I don't know I don't know
if that's true it could be they're not
that none of them are true but boy do
they look
true if if I had to bet my life on it I
would bet some number of these claims of
rigging are exactly what they look like
if I had to bet my life on it but that's
only if I had to you know I'd prefer not
because I'm not
sure but I always go back to whether or
not we've found any irregularities we've
designed a system that appears to be
designed more for hiding the outcome
than for revealing it so if you have a
system which appears in every way to be
more designed to hide an outcome than to
give you a real one I think that you
should assume there's a reason for that
and I do and that's different from
having any proof I just look at the
design of the system and say well that
design should give you a non-credible
election every
time you be the
judge all right
um let's see what else is going
on uh
so uh the uh IDF the Israeli military
has done some air strikes in Lebanon
against Hezbollah sites and there were a
number of different attacks let's see
they hit a weapons Depot and air defense
site and they took out some leader Abu
shash Hezbollah operative in some
buildings now does that sound like an
escalation well it's more than I've
heard Israel doing in one day in that
direction
lately so you know I always I always
start with the assumption that Israel is
smart and then I analyze everything they
do from that
perspective I think that usually works I
mean they're they're presumably there
are sometimes when they they don't do
something smart but it's my first filter
I I just say okay if you were smart what
am I seeing so the first thing I'm
seeing is it looks like they they
ratcheted up their attacks on Hezbollah
during the DNC do you think that's a
coincidence
do you think it's a coincidence that
Israel is going in behind the cover of
the news being you know saturating in
the DNC I doubt it I doubt that's a
coincidence now because my starting
filter is that Israel smart would they
intentionally do a little uptick in in
violence during the
DNC yes that's what I'd do it if it were
me that's what I'd do now
Israel has already decided that they
would rather have Hezbollah actually do
a serious attack because they need to
provoke it because the timing is right
now for their action because we'll be
between presidents right next several
months the leadership of the United
States is going to be a little shaky we
know that it's like I don't I don't even
know who the president is so from
Israel's perspective again if you assume
that they're just always operating from
smart
they would say to themselves this next
several months we can get away with the
most stuff in terms of public opinion
because we we'll just be diverted we'll
be looking somewhere
else and so they might be prodding
Hezbollah and Iran for a bigger
response so one possibility is that uh
Israel isn't just warning them to stay
silent but rather is intentionally
poking them because Hezbollah will now
have to send more Rockets which Israel
can then respond a little extra hard
again and then as hbel will say well I
mean we might as well just send a
thousand Rockets if you're just going to
keep doing this and then they send their
thousand Rockets the Iron Dome knocks
most of the men of the air and then
Israel has a free pass to get rid of
Hezbollah once and for
all and I think everything's heading in
that direction
and I think that the reason it seems
like things might be compressed is
because Israel will never have in their
whole history a better opportunity to be
super violent against the people who
would kill them first if they had a
choice so everything is suggesting that
it's going to get really hot there
really
fast but not
unless Hezbollah takes the
bait so I believe believe that Iran and
Hezbollah have decided to stand down and
maybe not do the super big response and
I think Israel is daring them say Hey
where's your big response how about that
big response how about we kill a couple
of your leaders how about now big
response how about that weapons Depot
gone don't you wish you had that big
response big response I'm not touching
you I'm not touching you that's what it
feels
like well there's more news about the
story about drunk kamla or the
allegations that she's drunk in public
and it's been captured on video a number
of times um I was looking to looking at
an article from V sexina and bispack
review and V is talking about this issue
and the people on the right making these
accusations but here's a sentence I that
made me laugh it said uh this is from V
in bispack review talking about Newsweek
and V says according to Newsweek the
drinking rumors began with Trump
campaign Insider James Blair who tweeted
tweeted basically about
it does that sound right to you that the
rumors about KL haris drinking started
with James
Blair is that check fact
check you've all heard of something
called the Gil Man Amnesia because I
talk about it all the time time that
that's that situation where if you know
the story like you have some personal
connection to a story you know the news
is always
wrong but if you don't have a personal
connection you think well that news is
probably true but every time you know
something you can tell it's false every
time is this one of those
cases well here's what I
know I know for sure James Blair didn't
start that
rumor any anybody want to disagree with
that now you all I would consider
somewhat Insiders on this topic because
you've been watching on social media you
know that how I and a whole bunch of
other people have been talking about
this for a long time and very loudly
before James Blair made the first
mention of it so I know that this is
fake news I know that James Blair didn't
start anything the in fact I know that
the reason he felt safe mentioning it is
that it was already saturated in social
media but Newsweek told you it's coming
from the campaign why would they do that
why would they say it's coming from the
campaign instead of it's coming from
every single Republican who seen the
videos well if they say it comes from
the campaign everybody knows that's
 because if they said something
no matter what it is if you said said it
came from the Harris campaign what would
you say You' say I don't even need to
hear it it's because everything
that comes from a campaign is always
always so if you say everybody who's
looked at the video has the same opinion
because she certainly looks whatever is
the truth a lot of ordinary people look
at it and say yeah it looks drunk to me
and a lot of those people are police
officers who've had lots of experience
with drunks people who have themselves
have had addiction who say yeah I
recognize it that's it people have
family members who have been in that
situation say oh I wish I couldn't
recognize it but I can so you're talk
talking about a situation which is close
to a
fact which is lots of people looking at
the videos and saying okay that's
definitely drunk and by the way if
that's not drunk it's a bigger
problem right
if that's not
drunk there's something wrong with that
woman and we better figure out what that
is so the fact that she has completely
different personalities when when she's
appeared like when you know I mentioned
when she was at the DNC did she look
drunk when she did her appearance at the
DNC no not even a little bit not you
couldn't even twist your mind into
imagining she was inebriated not even a
little that's why when you see the
videos where it very clearly looks like
she is inebriated it means something
because it's not a normal situation even
for
her so Gman Amnesia just know that all
the news is fake because every time you
see the
news that you know about that's always
fake all right Obama gave his speech
last night I watched the little clip of
it of course it was full of hoaxes and
lies and but here's what I
noticed he looked very uncomfortable and
awkward and
sweaty um so you know I guess maybe just
they couldn't figure out the
temperature that did they have an AC
problem I've never seen Obama look like
uh Richard Nixon debating Kennedy before
but he did he didn't look comfortable or
happy whatsoever so I was kind of
expecting to watch Obama just to be
impressed by his um skill you know I've
told you before
that uh I've always been impressed with
Obama as a politician you know like Bill
Clinton skill is skill right it's the
same thing I say about Trump you know
aside from policies you just have to
give them full credit for having
incredible skill
Clinton um Obama Trump incredible
skills which haris doesn't
have um was that militant all right got
a few more drunks in the
comments uh I feel like there was
something I haven't gotten to yet but
probably I did so ladies and
gentlemen that concludes my prepared
marks for today do you know that if
you're still looking for some
entertainment for the year that um my
book reframe your brain is changing
people's lives have you ever looked at
the uh reviews for the people who read
my book reframe your brain
they're incredible and and it's one of
those books that actually does change
your life um almost certainly I mean
it's it's about as guaranteed as
anything could be now what's interesting
is it's it's a book full of reframes
different ways to look at ordinary
situations and most of them won't be the
ones that you need but they'll make you
look like a a genius so if you read all
the reframes and somebody comes to you
someday and says I have this problem
you'll know what to say it's like well
once you reframe it this way so it turns
you into the smartest person in your
environment because you'll have reframes
for things in every category um and if
there's even one if there's even one in
the entire book that fits your situation
it's life-changing and I hear about that
all the time people message me and say
uh change my life you know this one
reframe and they're different ones
people have different reframes that hit
their hit their feels but if you don't
like that you can see you might want to
get the version two of had to failed
almost everything and still wi big not
much different from version one it's
