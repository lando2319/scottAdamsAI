everybody
wow
what a day it is
what a day it is
not good not bad it's it's just a day
but what a day
what a day wow
now
i had this weird realization today
see if anybody uh
anybody agrees with this
i realize that
there are a lot of things that start
with the letter c
that are bad
you got your coronavirus
you got your congress
you got cancer you got china you got
climate change
if you've got a problem and it starts
with a c
you probably got a pretty big problem
but the exception
the exception
coffee
yeah coffee is always your friend
coffee will never cheat on you coffee
will never lie to you coffee will never
steal your
wallet
coffee
is always your friend
it'll make you feel better when you're
feeling down
and
in case you were a racist
it'll fix that too because coffee is
brown and you'll love it
it's indirect but i think it works
so
make sure you get your coffee if you get
any problems at all and we'll do the
simultaneous sip in a little bit once
everybody gets past the commercial
breaks here on
youtube
well here's a uh cool thing that's
happening that you don't see coming
you know that virtual reality exists
and you know that uh um
ar exists you know
basically extending reality and uh mr
technology it's merging the real and the
virtual worlds
so they're all kind of in that same
domain but here's what you didn't know
so you knew all those things exist
and you knew that they would get better
but
how many of you knew
that the key to making them better is
two technologies that
now exist
um augmented reality yes ar is augmented
reality i forgot the word augmented
there for a moment
thank you
but the two technologies that you need
to know about are 5g and
what's called edge computing
those two things didn't exist
really until sort of this year right at
least in as scale
now what 5g gives you is more than 4g
right so how many knew that
4g would be
awesome but 5g would be a little bit
better
wrong
5g is not a little bit better than 4g 5g
is way better
than 4g
in fact it's so better
that it's one of the key things that
would allow you know
broad adoption of these ar and vr and mr
technologies
along with something called edge
computing where basically the your your
local computer is dealing with the cloud
and it's
it's offloading some of the process into
the cloud so that your local computer
seems to be processing faster
now those two technologies
when put together
give you the computing power to do real
you know real kind of impressive
virtual reality stuff
and putting it everywhere
now
one of the biggest things that people
are blind to
is when gradual changes become not
gradual anymore
and we've been watching the speeds of
your phone
get sort of gradually better it's like
well we got 3g well 4gs yeah that's
better it's quite a bit better
5g is a whole different game
so 5g changes everything and 5g is
rolling out right now
so you don't have to
you know it's not that far future your
next phone i think will have 5g
capability if you're in a metropolitan
area
you got 5g
um
so this is a gigantic gigantic deal that
will change everything about your
reality because virtual reality will be
better than the real thing it will
change all of education it will change
all of social interaction
just think about that
just think about the size of the
statement i just made
that 5g
will change everything
everything
work
education and your social life
will not even be
recognizable in five years
in five years
the the change will be bigger than say
the change of just the internet
that's how big it is well i mean it's
hard to compare things but i would say
the invention of the internet itself
that's the size of the change that we're
looking at with 5g
it just doesn't feel like it because
well it's just one more g
i already had four g's i'm just adding
one more g how big a deal could that be
not so big a deal but let's
let's have a simultaneous sip to the
future which looks kind of awesome in
many ways but all you need for that is a
copper marker glass of tanker chelsea
stein a canteen junk flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite look
what i like coffee
even though it starts with the letter c
i like it i like it
there are other things that start with
the letter c that i'm rather fond of but
we won't go into that
for now
for now
join me for the unparalleled pleasure
the dope means of the day the thing that
makes everything better
including your phones and speeds it's
called the simultaneous sip of the
apostolico
okay a little bit of heartbreak here
i just realized that i had set my coffee
not on the coffee warmer
but rather on the desk adjacent to the
coffee warmer
thus making the temperature of my coffee
sub-optimal
but i'm going to fix that later let me
tell you
i'm not going to go through life with
cold sips i hope you did better
did you all do better
i failed at the simultaneous set but i
think
i think your day will do better
all right
um i've got a tip here on how to hide
from law enforcement many of you will
need that
raise your hands if you have some reason
to escape the law
just me all right well that's
embarrassing
but if you'd like to escape law
enforcement i would
take the technique that uh
that the uh who is the
hands way up that the uh
the fiancee of uh what's her name potito
who is missing
apparently he told so law enforcement is
looking for him because he's a at least
a person of interest maybe
i don't think he's a suspect
but they certainly like to know where he
is and to talk to him i guess person of
interest is is not fair because he
hasn't been charged with anything
but they certainly want to talk to the
uh
to the fiance when the when his fiancee
disappears and is murdered
presumably
so where is he well he's hard to find
because he left home with his backpack
and told his family he was going to the
carlton reserve
now i'm not familiar with the carlton
reserve but apparently it's a very big
place
and if you take your backpack into the
into the wilderness of the carlton
reserve
turns out that it will be hard to find
you with drones and helicopters i mean
you can hide for a long time
so
there's my tip on how to hide from law
enforcement
no
not go to the carlton reserve you idiots
tell somebody you went to the carlton
reserve and walk out the door with your
backpack
but the last thing you want to do
is go to the carlton reserve
because that's the only place they know
to look for you
but if you wanted to go somewhere else
somewhere that's not the carlton reserve
a really good way to do it is to walk
out with a backpack
and tell your parents that you went to
the carlton reserve
you do that and they're going to be
looking in the wrong place for you for a
long time
so that's my tip on avoiding law
enforcement
well apparently apple has decided that
they think it's iphone can diagnose
depression and cognitive decline
so it's not it's not designed to do that
but they're looking at that
and they think it can do everything from
reading your facial expressions
is that creepy
your phone will look at your face and
say
smile why are you why are you so sad
basically your phone could turn into
like a creepy guy
women back me up on this
ladies
you know that guy in the office
who sees you in the office and says hey
smile
what's what's so bad today
yeah now that's going to be your phone
your phone's going to be a creepy guy
hey what's wrong you look like you're
sad
yeah kim back me up on that exactly
um
so your phone's a creepy guy what's
wrong what can i do for you
but it'll also uh
apparently it'll track
your speaking pace
uh the frequency of your your walking
your sleep patterns your heart your
respiration rates
do you think that your phone can detect
depression
yes yes
do you think that your phone could
detect a trend
toward uh moving from let's say a
happier state to a more depressed state
do you think your phone could pick up
that trend
uh-huh
i could build that app
tomorrow
it would be an app that does this
are you using your iphone
yes or no
if you say yes
which it could actually detect because
you're using the phone
then it would it would determine that
you're more depressed than it used to be
why
because you're spending time on your
phone
how much technology do i need to
determine the people who have a phone in
their hand are less happy than if they
didn't
not a lot
not a lot
maybe just yes no
phone in hand yes
depressed
yes
more depressed than you used to be yes
you're looking at your phone are you
more anxious than you used to be
yes
do you feel
that you're more disconnected from life
yes
do you feel worried about your body
image yes
do you like my algorithm it's called the
yes algorithm
if if phone
yes to all of those problems so iphone
so apple has
quite helpfully
they're going to build an app
to tell you how sad their phone makes
you
i'm not making that up
i mean i'm wording it differently than
they're awarding it but i'm not making
that up
apple is making an app
i i don't know if it'll be free or
they're going to sell it to you
it'll tell you just exactly how the
phone is ruining your life
and then here's the fun part
probably going to blame it on something
else
do you think the phone is going to say
according to the data that we have
picked up from you
your phone is making you depressed
throw it in the garbage immediately
probably not
probably not
probably say something like maybe you
should get more sleep
probably tell you to take a walk in the
forest
but i don't think it's going to tell you
that your phone is what's causing you to
be depressed
when in fact it's your phone
i mean with the services that it
connects to
now i don't know if you can get rid of
phones but i don't know
um
is there a problem with today's stream
on uh
on locals i'm not seeing other people
complain about it it might be
yeah it looks like the stream is fine
for other people
so it may be a local a local problem not
a locals problem
all right um
and how about cognitive decline so your
phone could actually pick up your
cognitive decline it could definitely
get that but
you know i think we'll just find out if
you're stoned
um
you know i i'm you're not going to
believe this but
i know this goes against everything that
you think is true but and this this just
blows me away apparently the fbi did
something that uh is damaging their
reputation i know
i know
when was the last time the fbi did
anything that damaged the fbi's
reputation
i can't think of anything can you
when has that ever happened
well i guess this is the one and only
time lately that the fbi has embarrassed
itself
i guess they raided a bunch of safe
deposit boxes in beverly hills without
enough evidence of wrongdoing
and got millions of dollars but
now those people are probably going to
be in trouble with the irs
but there was no crime apparently
related to why they got into the boxes
but they might there might be a crime
now because they found all this money
and irs is going to be asking some
questions
but
it's kind of embarrassing because they
took all this money and they didn't have
real good reasons for it i guess
now you're just talking crazy scott
um
all right
so that's the whole story
but i'm wondering what will the fbi do
next hmm
what next to the fbi
will they
burn down an orphanage
will they murder some senior citizens
will they just start shaking people down
for money on the streets
i don't know
i feel like
i feel like it's moving in the wrong
direction
seems like they used to solve crimes and
stuff back in the old days i don't know
what they're doing now
but they've got a little bit of a
reputational problem
all right
so uh and this next story this is going
to blow you away you will never see this
coming
you might want to sit down
because this will be the surprise of
surprises
i know i know this is going to be hard
to break it to you but believe it or not
the infrastructure bill
is stalled in congress
i know
i know who saw that coming
but the best reason the the best part of
this story is
why it's stalled i mean there's been you
know reason after reason after reason
why it's stalled but the new reason is
just the best
this is the best reason
turns out that congress has a
parliamentarian
who gets to decide if if they're
following the rules
and the latest infrastructure bill
didn't follow the rules
sufficiently that the parliamentarian
would even let them vote on it
now apparently and if i understand it
right the the problem is that they tried
to use a budget bill
to make substantial changes to um was it
immigration
and
that's not allowed
so you can't use the budget
to kind of be a backdoor way to make
major changes you can make minor changes
but you can't make major changes to some
existing legislation or systems just by
tweaking the budget that's that's not
allowed parliamentarian wise
but here's the thing
they didn't know that
who put the bill together
the people who put the bill together
didn't know
that it's not even votable
i mean dear god
they used to at least make bills that
they couldn't decide on
they've moved backwards
now they don't even know how to make a
bill
that you can even vote on
they literally couldn't craft the bill
to be votable
i think they're moving backwards
because in the old days it was just
you know we disagree on the bill
but we voted on it
and now they can't even figure out how
to make a votable bill
let me take you back
come back with me in the waybag machine
we're going back to the early days in
egypt
several thousand years ago
and we watched the egyptians build
pyramids
sophisticated
building they're building pyramids
i'm not sure that we've evolved in the
right direction because now we can't
even make a bill we can vote on
much less a pyramid
i don't know could you build a pyramid i
couldn't i wouldn't know how to make a
pyramid
but i also wouldn't know how to make
legislation oh no i probably would i
think i could have made legislation you
could vote on
i might add some typos and spelling
errors but i'll bet you could have voted
on it
i'll bet i could have accomplished that
little that goal
so yeah congress looking bad
so joy joy reid joy anne reed
was talking about this gabby potito case
the missing white woman
and referred to it as a missing white
woman syndrome
missing white woman syndrome now she
didn't make that up she borrowed that
from somebody else's
commentary
but uh
in a break from
tradition
i would like to completely agree with
joy anne reed
i know i know
she's right on this
do you think we'd be having this story
if she was not a white woman
an attractive young white woman
do you think
i don't think this would be a national
story
if she were just a black woman
exact same story but it's a black woman
are we talking about it
somebody says yes
you think yes
i
i appreciate your optimism
and and i respect it
i i would respect your disagreement in
this case usually i respect any
reasonable disagreement
but
i gotta go with joy reid on this
i i feel like you know you can't prove
it right there's no data that backs my
opinion but it sure feels like it
yeah she was a youtuber yeah okay
but i never heard of her
did you
it's not like we've heard of her right
and there are plenty of youtubers
people of color who are youtubers
i don't know i think joyan reed is right
on this one but i'll respect your
disagreement on that
um
china has decided they're banning what
they call uh or at least the translation
of what they're calling it is quote
 men
 men
men who are wearing makeup and you know
let's say in their words more effeminate
effeminate
dress
and apparently this is a
some kind of a risk to the chinese
system because they don't want any
non-conformity or at least not that much
non-conformity
and they don't want these
so-called men
now they're not stating the sexuality
which is interesting
so they're not they're not saying uh
it's bad to be gay
i imagine they have those feelings as
well but that's not officially what
they're saying they're talking about
just the outward
appearance of
some number of men
and
i'm thinking to myself
i wonder if china's going down for this
because you know
humans are funny you could do all kinds
of terrible things to human beings and
they'll be like okay i'll just get used
to it
but then you go after some things
and you don't think that's the biggest
thing and then people just go nuts
and maybe this is it
now i've told you that china isn't in
for big problems
i don't know if this is a big big
problem um
but
but
uh i could see the lgbtq community
which is i so assume in deep hiding in
china i can see them
maybe emerging
and
how powerful is the lgbtq community
i mean
you know maybe maybe they don't have the
option in china because there would be
too much uh too much pushback
but i feel like they're gonna find a way
feel like they'll find a way like there
there may be some amount of bravery that
that will push through i mean you'd have
to be super brave to
you know be an lgbtq
activist in china
but
people are brave
there are brave people in the world we
could be surprised
um
here's the weirdest story facebook
censored a uh a post
by uh bjorn lomborg
uh
you might know him as
as one of the people talks about climate
change and the economics of climate
change and points out that if you were
to objectively look at the economics of
climate change it doesn't look so bad
if you're if you were to be objective
and and to analyze it correctly
now
uh the lancet
pointed out that global warming
saves more people than it kills
this is in the lancet right this is not
conspiracy theory
this is not a climate denier
this is in the lancet
right
and i'll talk about project veritas
and in the landsat
they said
basically that more people are saved by
it warming up because the the most
dangerous thing is the cold
i guess the cold kills more people than
the heat
i didn't know that
so so far it looks like
global warming has saved a net
166 000 lives each year
so they're more deaths
they're more deaths from heat for sure
but there are more far more people saved
by it being a little warmer
now here's the funny part
facebook
sensor that
censored it
facebook censored
the lancet
not because that any of the information
was wrong
just think about that it's a scientific
a respected scientific you you could
argue how respected it is but certainly
in the upper tier
of scientific publications even though
they've had some major issues
right
and facebook
decided to censor them
and not because they were wrong
i don't believe i don't believe facebook
said this is wrong
because i don't think the data is wrong
or at least you know that's not the
problem
it's just that the narrative didn't go
their way i think
now maybe i'm missing something in the
story but i don't think so because i
heard this from bjorn himself he
messaged me on
twitter because twitter did not censor
it
so
we'll give the thumbs up to twitter
allow this content because it's right
it's just it's just actual data and it's
the lancet so twitter says yes
facebook censored it
i mean
my god
my god
um
now do the deadly virus hoax
somebody says all right
new york times has some fear porn today
says scientists have detected early
warning signs that a critical ocean
system is at risk
according to a new analysis a slowdown
in the network which influences weather
far and wide could spell trouble so the
essence here is that climate change will
change the
the nature of the ocean systems and that
could be cataclysmic
cataclysmic that sounds pretty bad
so that's what the tweet says do you
think the article says that
do you think the article
says anything like what this tweet says
that
a critical ocean system is at risk and
blah blah blah from climate change
nope
not exactly
what it does say is that the people
studying it don't see any signs that
we're in trouble
it could be because things are changing
so it is it is true that it's a risk
but it's not it's not sized
is it a one percent risk
90 risk
even the people studying are saying no
no don't say it's a risk i mean or don't
say
don't say we know this is going to
happen we don't know it might be a
problem might not be a problem that's
very different isn't it
so
this is clearly a case of turning a real
story into fear born
all right a lot of hallucinating people
have any of you been following me on
twitter lately and watched the comments
and you see how many people are
literally hallucinating opinions for me
i'll tell you the funniest ones these
are real people saying this in public
and cognitive dissonance is really easy
to spot when you're not in it
if it's somebody else's cognitive
dissonance it really stands out let me
give you some examples
somebody said today
to me
said you fail to recognize that vaccine
hesitancy is caused by the perceived
risk of the shot
what
so i'm being criticized
for failing to recognize that vaccine
hesitancy is caused by
people thinking that the shop might be
risky
what
there isn't a single person in the world
who has this misunderstanding
literally every person in the world
knows that vaccine hesitancy
is because people are worried about the
shot
how can you possibly hallucinate that
i'm on the other side of this opinion
now a lot of my uh
tweets today that my critics come after
me are like this one
where somebody states an assumption that
i have
and then about it except the
assumption that they give me is a
ridiculous and certainly nothing i've
ever said or thought or suggested so the
typical comment about bee today is
scott says
the moon is full of cheese
but the probes don't seem to suggest
that
and i think
well no i really didn't say the moon is
full of cheese
but why are you even thinking that
now there's a reason that so much of it
is happening today do you know
why is so much of that
happening to me
today
it's because of my tweets lately
which means that i've triggered
cognitive dissonance in a number of
people and they're playing it out by
saying literally ridiculous things
and imagining that somehow that's my
opinion
because if they attack my actual opinion
they'd have a problem
because they can't or they don't know
how
um
all right project veritas there's a
whistleblower video
in which a doctor in some hospital is
saying that the vaccinations are shed
those are her exact words the
vaccinations are shed
and that there's somebody in the
hospital who has some probably
myocarditis
from getting the vaccination at least
that's suspected the cause
now
is that a whistleblower
who is blowing the whistle and actually
also says that that person would not be
tracked
so i guess that's even the worst part
is that if there's a person who had an
adverse
effect
and as far as this doctor knows there's
no tracking
that nobody's going to pick this up
is that true
do you think that nobody is studying
adverse effects
because i think that they're doing it by
sample
what do you think
i could be wrong but my belief is that
the
you know there are some groups of
experts who have at least sampled
done surveys
and asked people all right you got the
vaccination how did you feel the week
after or whatever
don't you think they did sampling
now i do believe that they did not track
meaning count every person
count every person who uh got it that
sounds that sounds real i mean she's the
doctor she would know they're not
reporting it
if she says they're not reporting i
believe it
that seems seems credible
but don't you think they've sampled it
the doctor is silent on that
so i would say first of all the doctor
is
showing some ignorance
i think but do give me a fact check it
might be me showing the ignorance
my belief
and this is
this is not based on a specific source
but my belief is that we do track it but
we do it by samples not by trying to
count every person can somebody give me
a fact check on that
is there anybody here who would know the
answer to that
somebody says sampling would only be
during initial trials
originally but i think that we have
sampled after that and we would also be
sampling the people from the trials
right
were there not tens of thousands of
people in the trials
and would that not be enough if you
followed up on them to know how many of
them got a bad reaction and wouldn't
that tell you what you needed to know
so if you have that data would you
absolutely need to count the people or
would you trust the samples
all right
so i would say that that doctor doesn't
know the answer to that question
probably i don't think any of you do i'm
looking at your
um
look at your answers i don't think any
of us know the answer to this but i
don't think the doctor does either so
factor that in
very few people in trials no i think
there were like 40 000 people in trials
weren't there by now
probably different
different vaccinations but my question
is this for people who
but
i just saw a comment i'm gonna have to
deal with later
all right
then this doctor said that uh you know
the vaccination is causing a problem now
was this anecdotal information or or
data that you should make decisions on
all right there's a whistleblower doctor
with a video
project veritas who says she has
specific you know knowledge of a patient
or maybe two
that had
negative effects from the vaccination
she thinks
is that data
or is that just an anecdotal situation
and a doctor spouting off who might not
know how they track
stuff
why is this even in the news
does anybody know
why why is this even the headline
somebody says you know something is off
here no i don't
i don't know that if you're saying does
do these vaccinations have more side
effects than other vaccinations i
wouldn't be surprised at that
that wouldn't surprise me at all
but we're comparing that to the
alternative of no vaccination
the doctor was recorded without her
knowledge yes
yeah that doesn't make it a
whistleblower does it
but why is this even news
there's a doctor who is worried about
the vaccination side effects
probably lots of doctors are worried
about the side effects if you've ever
seen the side effect i would imagine if
you're a doctor and you had a patient
who had a side effect you'd be very
worried about it
even if it was just one
right
so
um
you're welcome
yeah i don't know is there might be
something in the story i'm missing but
one doctor who sees some
uh bad side effects from
the vaccination we already knew that
we know that there are side effects we
just don't know how many and this story
doesn't give us that right
is the only question is how many
do we all agree with that
there's nobody who's doubting their bad
side effects with vaccinations including
this one
the only question is how many
and that whistleblower thing didn't give
us any information about how many
so i don't know
what did we get from that
so you know the mystery of why china
seems to have no cova deaths or
virtually none
uh i i got a i saw a hypothesis on this
on linkedin
so a gentleman who has some connection
with china seems to have a little uh it
seems to have a hand on things over
there
said the following and he sounded
authoritative it sounded like he knew i
wasn't guessing
i'll just put this out here as
hypothesis okay just the hypothesis
number one
doctors in china don't test for covet
they just treat it
if you have symptoms for covet
they just assume you have it
and they treat you like you have it
including quarantine including whatever
therapeutics
but they don't
count it
so
one part of the uh one part of it could
be there might be plenty of covet but
they're treating it like the flu
they're just making sure that you
quarantine
and nobody talks about it it's like okay
you got this symptom
stay away from everybody for two weeks
and take these therapeutics and let me
know if it gets worse
so it sounds like they just don't count
it
they just treat it like it's cold
now
uh the other thing that this gentleman
suggested is that in china and i can't
confirm this right this is an
unconfirmed report
he says he seems to know he says he
knows this that the deaths are listed by
the comorbidity not by coronavirus so if
you've got
if you've got some advanced cancer
and you also get the coronavirus and you
die
in china they say you die to cancer
do you believe that i don't know that
it's true this is this is the
this is the report from one person that
i can't confirm
i'll bet they do at least some of them
maybe
and are they wrong would that be lying
yeah i'm saying in the comments somebody
says yeah that's logical
i would say that somebody who has
advanced cancer
and dies at the same time that they have
coveted it might have been the last
straw
but they died from cancer
right likewise somebody who's morbidly
obese
gets covered and dies
i feel like they died from obesity
like in my brain that's how i process it
i get that the last straw
and the the last you know causal
proximate thing was the covet
but it doesn't feel like that's what
killed them i mean just in my mind it
doesn't feel like that
so maybe in china they do count it
differently also
i'm told that the average age is younger
in china
the life expectancy is much less is that
true
i don't know that that's true but if it
is true you would have fewer 80 pluses
to die as a percentage but there's still
be so many of them in china
seems like that can't be part of the
answer
and then the of course the weight
of the chinese people there are very few
overweight people relatively speaking if
if the only thing that was different in
china was
they they basically don't have much in
the way of fat people
and doctors aren't testing for it so
they're not recording it they're just
treating it and they list the death by
the comorbidity
have we explained the whole thing
did that explain everything
i'm not quite there
i don't think that would explain
everything it doesn't feel like enough
but maybe part of it could be part of
the answer i don't know
it's it feels true-ish
let me say it's credible without
necessarily knowing that it's true
sounds credible i mean it just has that
feel to it doesn't it
somebody says vitamin d levels i don't
think that's
the big thing in china
all right maybe it's the green tea who
knows i've heard that green tea has some
properties
so far there's 675 000 coveted deaths at
least the way we count them here in the
united states
as
jonah goldberg was tweeting
caused some people to uh
respond
punky booster responded by showing the
actual mortality rates by age group
so for example under the age of 19 your
survival rate is 99.9973
it doesn't sound like much of a problem
does it
you go up the range get all the way up
to 50 to 59
and your survival rate if you get it is
still 99.73
again
it doesn't seem like that big of a
problem does it
but you get above 70
and
some suddenly you're in the range of
five percent of the people dying
over 70. now that includes people who
are institutionalized et cetera in
hospitals
now
i like this standard and i'm going to
adopt it so i i take this point that
these percentages say this is something
we should not be worried about
and so i'm going to stop worrying about
other things too
for example
i'm gonna stop worrying about uh gun
violence
because as a percentage of people it's
not really very high
gun violence
what percentage of people die from guns
it's gotta be pretty low
right as a percentage at least you know
in different certainly in my age group
how many people in my age group die from
gun violence
people in their 60s
like zero
so why why do i care about gun violence
should i
right how about drunk driving
should we should we have any laws about
drunk driving
because as a percentage
very few people die of drunk driving
very few so why worry about it
how about overdose deaths
yeah
lost in the rounding how many people 64
years old
that's my age how many how many people
died from overdose deaths age 64.
vanishingly small
vanishingly small so i'm not worried
about it
right
how about domestic terrorism
domestic terrorism what why don't we
report domestic terrorism
the same way as a percentage of
americans who die from it
why is domestic terrorism are our top
priority
when almost nobody dies from it
percentage-wise it's like nothing
all i'm asking is why don't we use the
same standard for everything
they're not the same i'm not suggesting
all these topics are the same but there
should be a reason
a reason we treat them differently i
just don't know what the reason is
yeah percentage dying from fentanyl tiny
as a percentage of all overdoses it's a
big percentage
but as a percentage of people in my age
group
nothing
practically nothing
yeah
so just think about that
i always suggest that anything is a
problem if it's a problem in its
absolute number or its percentage
it's a problem if either one of those is
a problem it's a problem
you can't say that the number is big but
i'm going to ignore it because the
percentage is small
that's not really
the way we think about anything really
let's talk about that vares database you
know the vares database that shows the
negative
potentially negative reports of people
who got vaccinations and then had a bad
outcome from the vaccination itself
well the various database as you know is
not
scientific it's just supposedly to raise
a flag in case there are big problems
that are so big that you don't even need
a study to see them
right looking for problems that are so
big
you don't need to do a controlled trial
to look for them they're like oh my god
everybody's reporting that their ears
are falling off or something
so then you do the study if if you saw a
flag raised so it's not science
but it's useful the various database
now the thing that's important about it
is that if you look at the numbers
reported you know from vaccinations in
prior years it's tiny little graph if
you look at the past year it's this
gigantic number
so we went from very few vaccination
reports relatively speaking to a big
number with these new vaccinations so
what's that tell you
go
what's that tell you the vares database
has a big big spike really big
based on this latest vaccination for the
covet what's that tell you
in the comments
uh well it does tell you it raises a
flag right
so exactly what the vera's database is
supposed to do
it tells you hey you better look into
this so we'd all agree on that right
point number one
the vares database does i think we all
agree
tell us that the coronavirus vaccination
is something we need to look at
everybody on the same page
it definitely flags that you should look
at it
now once you look at it suppose you find
out that the reports are all true
what if you find they're all true do you
then
um ban the vaccination
no no that's not how it works you would
still compare the benefits of the
vaccination to the reported and and
actually confirmed problems
so the fact that there might be let's
say
20 times
i'll just pick a number i don't know if
this is accurate let's say there are 20
times more vera's report for the
coronavirus vaccination
does that mean you should not take it
no
no nothing like that it just means there
might be 20 times more problems maybe we
don't know but maybe
but that wouldn't get to the question of
whether you should take it because you
still have to compare it to the
alternative all right now here's a
thought experiment you ready you ready
to have your minds blown by a thought
experiment
imagine this
imagine the legislation comes out that
every american
needs to eat one banana
okay every american has to eat one
banana
and
and then report to the vares database
the following week after eating the one
banana
any bad health outcomes
what would that year on the vares
database look like
everybody got a banana
everybody whole country everybody got a
banana
at the same time one banana
and then for the week or two after they
report to the vares database all their
health problems now remember if you had
a bad
headache that goes in
now you don't know that that was caused
by the vaccination but that's not what
the varus database does
the varus database just says
i got vaccinated
soon after i had this problem
it doesn't go to causation
what would the spike in that data look
like
well i think it would be through the
moon wouldn't it
if you were to track the health outcomes
from a banana would it look exactly like
the health outcome from the verse
from the vaccination
right
now in past vaccinations what percentage
of the country got vaccinated in any one
year
right in a typical year let's say 2014
just pick a year what percentage of all
humans in the country got vaccinated
five
five percent i'm just guessing somebody
says 30 really
oh yeah maybe maybe 30
yeah if you count with flu and
everything else could be yeah
um
but can you compare a year in which 30
get vaccinated to a year in which
seventy percent get vaccinated
i mean that's one difference right so at
the very least
you have to adjust your numbers for how
many people are getting any kind of
vaccination at all
and then look at the uh the banana
example
how many if everybody ate a banana 300
million people ate a banana how many
people would have a bad outcome within a
week
10 million you'd probably have 10
million people
with a banana related bad outcome that
had nothing to do with a banana it just
happened to be that week
our rw here so i keep telling you about
all the cognitive dissonance
rw says this scott let me help you out
quote i was wrong about everything for
the last year and a half about
coronavirus
speaking about me being wrong about
everything about the coronavirus i would
submit that i am the most right about
the coronavirus of any
public figure
do your own research find out for
yourself look at everything i've said
about the coronavirus from the start
and compare everything i've said about
it
to every other
pundit and i will bet you a large amount
actually that i have the most accurate
predictions
not 100
no but nobody got everything right right
would you all agree that everybody got
something wrong
um i said the vaccine is a therapeutic
right i said that i said from the start
that therapeutics would be what gets us
through this not vaccinations
and sure enough the vaccination is just
a therapeutic
right
i said that masks i said they were lying
about mask effectiveness
and they were
now
you you're arguing that maybe they're
still wrong about masks separate
question
what i predicted is that they were lying
about the masks and that was confirmed
nobody else said that
who was the first person in the world to
say we should close
travel from china
okay probably jack basaba but who is the
second person
me
me
way before trump did it
if you go right down the
i was the most accurate about the
pandemic i think by far
i don't think anybody was even close
if you look decision by decision
um
you advised trump i didn't advise him on
the coronavirus
um you were not better than z dog
really
i challenge accepted
somebody said i was not better than z
dog and z dog's very good if you're not
following z dog on locals and other
places you should
um
so z dog would be you know
at the highest level of credibility i
would say
for any of this stuff and i'll bet i'll
bet my record would be better than this
because i remember i didn't make a
prediction on everything
so if there were things that i didn't
have a strong feeling about i just
didn't make a prediction
but when i did
i bet i had the strongest accuracy
record of anybody in the public
check it out yourself
but make sure you don't leave anything
out right and make sure you you
accurately get my opinion
all right
i'm going to need to go in a moment
but i will tell you that my comment
about the vares database and the banana
example
was liked on twitter by a mayo clinic
professor vincent
rajkumur i don't know if you're watching
vincent but thank you for liking that
and i only point that out to say there
was at least one person who does know
what they're talking about
who agreed with my point
doesn't mean it's right but at least one
smart person
who knows what he's talking about agrees
with it just in case you wondered if
anybody did
all right norm's autobiography yeah i
keep hearing that i should listen to
norm's autobiography um i've listened to
exactly zero books on tape so i don't
expect that
that to change
um
yeah you can you could keep asking me
but i don't think it's going to happen
you were correct we had a massive
increase in the number of vaccinations
compared to pre-22 yeah we should have
your point is flawed
i love the people who just say your
point is flawed
all right that's all i got now and i
will talk to you
