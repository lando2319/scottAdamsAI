good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of your entire life
it's called coffee with scott adams and
this is the special
christmas eve edition
yeah
in case you didn't think it could get
any better it could be special
and let me remind you
that tomorrow a lot of the people that
you would see on a regular basis and by
regular i mean
let's say five days a week
you know nobody does seven days a week
like i do
but tomorrow a lot of them will be gone
but not me not me i'll be here
and not only will i be here but i'll be
here with a simultaneous sip a special
christmas edition and i'll all need then
and all you need now is a copper mug or
glass a tanker chelsea steiner canteen
sugar flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better
including the holidays it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now go
yeah that was that was it yeah
that was the stuff
well there's a report that a team of
astronomers have discovered
70 rogue planets
in the milky way
now they're rogue because they're
they're not they're not surrounding a
star
so they're not uh
orbiting a star
they're rogue planets
and they just discovered them i guess
we've never seen
70 rogue planets in the milky way before
but uh
i'm no fool
i'm no fool
70 rogue planets
suddenly appear
i think it's pretty clear that these are
death stars
and they're heading our way
so if you're worried about the
coronavirus or climate change
doesn't look like that's going to be
your biggest problem
70 death stars heading our way
allegedly
um i'd like to point out again that
every day this is weird
it's just weird
a coincidence really
but
we've learned in the last several years
and correct me if i'm wrong that
our intelligence agencies can't be
trusted the news can't be trusted or
politicians can't be trusted
in fact every institution in american
life has shown us that it can't be
trusted
except
our election system
now i guess we're all pretty lucky
because a hundred percent of our other
systems
are known to be fraudulent
in substantial ways
but our election system can i have a
standing ovation for the only thing in
the whole country that is not corrupt
oh
it's impossible to audit it by design
so it would be fair to say that you
wouldn't know if it was corrupt but it's
not
it's not
standing ovation
let's give it up for the election system
the only thing in america that is not
corrupt even though it easily could be
and there's no way to check
sarcasm
yes sometimes you can mock things
into happening when you can't reason
them into happening
and i'm going to mock into
existence
the belief
that our election system is the only one
without a problem
i'm going to try to sell that
only one
how about how about the uh
international financial
world
that's okay great right no oh oh there's
plenty of fraud
there's lots of fraud in the financial
world huh well at least our banking
system never made
what our banking system has paid
gigantic fines for fraudulent activities
well
okay i guess you can't change can't
trust the banking system
but thank goodness our elections
are first-rate
airtight
and uh
working
firing on all cylinders
um i was reminded yesterday that it is
unfair to go after somebody's appearance
don't you think
you know saying nasty things about some
public
figures appearance
totally uh inappropriate
this came to me after i mentioned that
the uh the 16 19 projects nicole hannah
jones
dresses like a clown
now she actually has like bright red
clown hair with the two puffs
and wears clothing that
sort of is evocative of the clown vibe
if you know what i mean
and
i do think that there could be special
cases
right
here's a special case
suppose and this did not happen but
suppose the surgeon general of the
united states weighed 600 pounds
would yet would it be appropriate to
mention his or her appearance
i think so
because it would be the surge in general
somebody who's promoting health and if
they weighed 600 pounds i feel like that
would be
something you could criticize
based on appearance
am i right
likewise if somebody is selling the
most clownish idea that the world has
ever seen
and they dress exactly like a clown
that has to be noticed
all right you can't have a clown
like
idea
and dress like a clown
and then asked me not to notice that
i mean i am willing to go with the idea
that
we shouldn't make fun of people's
appearance
in general
in
general but not in these cases
these are very special cases
you know you you give me clown material
and dress like a clown i'm not going to
ignore that
okay
uh
speaking of uh the golden age
i think it's the golden age for pranks
uh because somebody did this prank it
was a fake headline somebody faked a new
york times headline
uh that made it look as if teachers
were going to permit bullying against
unvaccinated children
so somebody faked a headline
this
for the new york times
calling on teachers to permit bullying
against unvaccinated children and uh all
the fact-checkers had to
had to fact check it as false because we
live in such absurd times that it was
believable
[Laughter]
so this is the golden age of pranks
where you can say anything
and just put it in the headline and
somebody's going to say yeah that
probably happened
that looks well within the realm of
something that could have happened
golden age for pranks
if you don't think i'll be taking
advantage of that
you don't know me
how many of you saw eclipse or the whole
interview of trump talking with candace
owens
did many of you see that it's getting a
lot of news today
now it's interesting how it's being
framed
of course because trump's involved so
it's it's highly polarizing
uh but it's
some people are framing it as though
trump
uh schooled candace owens on the value
of vaccines
but i'm not quite sure i saw that
i mean i watched it
but
what i saw was he made a claim trump did
that the people who were vaccinated are
having far better outcomes
but i didn't see her push back on that
did she
so it wasn't really a disagreement was
it he made a claim and it just
it was true
i mean it's compatible with science
whether it's true or not
and
she and then she brought up a related
question
about mandates and then they agreed
again trump doesn't like mandates
candace doesn't like mandates so they
agreed on that
uh but then she
she sort of started focusing i don't
want to say she moved the goal post
because i'm not sure that that happened
but she started focusing on the question
of should somebody young and fit
such as herself get vaccinated
and
i don't know that
trump had an opinion on that
so it was a weird kind of situation
in which
um some people imagined they were having
some kind of a disagreement
but i didn't see any did you
did you see any disagreement
i didn't see any
and
uh but i did notice that there is a i'll
talk about what we do and do not know
about the vaccines but um i think this
is
it sort of showed you why you need the
point counterpoint kind of discussion
and you don't want
a person interviewing one person
that that model just gives you confusion
right and we saw it again here but
people couldn't even tell what they saw
did they see two people agreeing or
disagreeing
i saw two people agreeing
what did you see
did you see two people disagreeing or
did you see two people agreeing on
everything
what did you see if you saw it
i mean that's pretty basic were they
agreeing or disagreeing
we can't even agree on that
yeah okay
and
a lot of conservatives have you seen
conservatives say that vaccinations
qui quote don't work
have you seen that
how many would you how many of you would
say that's true
how many of you would agree with the
statement and i'll we'll talk about what
that really means but how many of you
would agree with the statement
vaccinations quote don't work
agree or disagree
uh
mostly disagree okay i say yes on
youtube
okay
interesting because i'm still seeing
people i've seen more yeses on youtube
for some reason i think i think the
locals people have
uh
i hate to tell you but they're better
informed
[Laughter]
in general they tend to be better
informed at least on the topics i talk
about because you know we talk about the
same stuff
um
so
here's what i saw on fox news and i'm
not going to name names because it's got
there's got to be more than one person
doing this but i did see a prominent
conservative last night on fox news say
vaccines don't work
did anybody see that
i'm not going to name names
but did you see a prominent
conservative tell you that
vaccines don't work on tv last night and
it wasn't questioned
i don't think there was any pushback on
it
why would he say that
he would say that because you can still
get um
you can still transmit and catch the
virus
if you're vaccinated
but it seems that
some people may be to
i don't know manage their audience or
something
are saying that it doesn't work
when we know as trump pointed out that
it lowers uh hospitalizations and deaths
radically
or at least all information is another
side now how many of you would disagree
with this statement
that when the president said that
vaccinated people have better outcomes
that a hundred percent of the data
agrees with them
would anybody disagree with that
statement that all of the data agrees
there's no data that says anything else
would anybody
push back on that
that 100 of the data all of it
every data anybody's ever looked at
says the vaccinations drastically lower
your risk of death
does anybody see anything different
i haven't okay if you've seen something
different send it to me
but i think the president was on pretty
solid ground at least in terms of
agreeing with science you know science
could be wrong
no absolutes
i'm telling you that what i've seen
was 100 of the data on one side but i'm
asking you for an exception so
i'll take your i take your guidance that
i should avoid absolutes
right nothing's 100 that's correct
it's easy to talk in absolutes and it's
it's i like it when you catch me that's
one of the corrections i always
appreciate if i accidentally speak in an
absolute because that's never true
you know the absolute well i just use an
absolute to talk about absolutes
so let me let me just
escape that conversation
christopher hill on twitter said this
until someone answers the question
at what age slash bmi is it no longer
statistically beneficial to be
vaccinated against cover 19
all of this is a joke
well not all of it
but
isn't that a pretty big
a pretty big thing that we don't know
and isn't that a fair question shouldn't
we see a chart that's got
i'm designing on the fly here but i
think if you had an age on one side
and
bmi on the other on the other
axis
that you could
find the place you know the zone
where you're both old enough
and heavy enough
that you've got to get you've got to
worry
wouldn't that visual
we could produce that right we have
enough data at this point
and
if we haven't given that to the public
you have to assume that we're not
working with science
is that fair to say
that given that this could be produced
you know the crossover of age bmi to
know when when it doesn't make sense to
get
vaccinated instead we're just
vaccinating everybody
but that tells you that we departed
science right or does it
i i'm gonna i'm gonna take the opposite
argument a little bit later
i'm just priming you
okay
so it is very annoying that we don't
know that
um i made the statement
that uh i had fun with this one and i
have to admit this was a little bit
trollish
because i really wanted to get comments
and then read you the comments
so
so it was a little more trollish than i
have been doing lately i don't know if
you've noticed but i've been trying to
reduce the trolling you know where
you're just trying to get a big response
and try to make things
you know value added
although sometimes things are just
entertaining so i can't resist but
here's what i said and i'll tell you
some weird reactions to it i said our
collective awareness
is now almost
high enough and the almost is a key here
is almost high enough to realize that no
one used reason to make their
vaccination decision
fear made all of our decisions and we
rationalized it after the fact
to imagine otherwise is a denial of what
science knows about decision making
so here's the thing
it is irrational to say
that you followed the science
and made a decision about your
vaccination
do you know why that's irrational
it's irrational to say it doesn't matter
who you are or even what your argument
is it's always irrational to say i
followed the science
and then i reached my rational
conclusion
do you know why that's irrational
because science knows we don't do that
if you follow science you know that you
didn't do that
you can't have it both ways
you can't say you followed science and
reached reasonable
decision
if you believe in science if you believe
in science you know you don't have that
ability
you don't have the ability to reach
rational decisions
not in situations like this where
there's lots of complexity
and lots of unknowns it just can't be
done
we all got there by fear
now you're gonna say yourself
um scott i didn't
um yeah maybe other people did and maybe
only the people who got vaccinated
but i'm pretty sure i didn't
so here's my statement again
our collective awareness awareness is
now
almost high enough
to realize
so a lot of people who don't yet have
not reached that level of awareness
are fighting hard to
represent their point of view let me
tell you what it looks like
when people who are in thoroughly
irrational territory
try to rationalize
their irrationality
are you ready for this
here are just some comments i picked out
for this and i won't even tell you who
made the comment because i don't think
that's fair because it's sort of
everybody's in the same uh
same group here
so one user said to me i didn't use fear
at all just common sense
what's the first problem
there's no such thing as common sense
common sense is what you do what you say
you had when you have an irrational
decision
and then you rationalize it after the
fact
we know common sense doesn't exist
because you and i would have the same
opinion on everything
you and i would just use our common
sense oh we all agreed on everything
common sense absolutely does not exist
so here's the first
the first pushback that uh
against us uh he uses common sense and
he says my ability to see blatant lies
for what they are
and use an example that ivermectin is
dangerous that's a
that's a this user says is a blatant lie
uh told me everything i needed to know
about my decision
did it
did that one lie
allegedly this one person believes he
can identify lies
has common sense and didn't use fear at
all
what level of awareness is that about
his own place in the universe
it's pretty low
it's pretty low because we don't have
common sense you did use your fear and
you certainly don't know if ivermectin
was a lie
you might have a strong opinion but you
certainly don't know
at this point
all right let me give you another one
someone said
i disagree
vaccines typically have more time to
observe long-term effects
in other words we usually have more data
for vaccines these were administered in
record time with full understanding that
long-term risks were a question mark
i think one can reasonably refuse a
vaccine where the long-term
long-term risks are unknown what about
that
is this a rational take that you can
refuse a vaccine where the long-term
risks are unknown
is that is that a good take
since you don't know if the vaccination
is good or bad in the long term because
we don't have data
that therefore not taking it is it
reasonable
is it
no it's fear
you'd have to know the risk of the virus
which we don't in the long term and
you'd have to know the risk of the
vaccination in the long term we don't
know either one
so here's someone who doesn't know
either the cost or the benefit of the
decision
and is comfortable with the
reasonableness of his decision
without knowing the costs
and without knowing the benefits of any
of the variables that mattered
but so this is what it looks like when
you have a fear-based decision that you
rationalize after the fact i'll give you
give you some more
by the way once you learn to recognize
this
you'll you just see it everywhere
you'll see that people are just
rationalizing their fears and pretty
much that's all we do
almost all of what we think is our
common sense and our thinking is just
rationalizing fears
here's another one alright we know
healthy children that are at very low
risk a child is 10 times more likely to
die of cancer
i would say that is reasonably
sufficient information when you're
trying to make a decision against a
vaccine whose long-term risks are
unknown
it's a no-brainer for me
is it a no-brainer
so
how many of you would agree with the
statement that because children that are
super low risk
that therefore vaccinating them isn't
good for them how many of you would
agree with the statement
we should not vaccinate young children
go
how many of you agree with that
i'm expecting almost all of you to agree
with this right
agree agree agree don't know agree yes
yes yes yes now when you say you agree
the
i assume that your argument is
i assume your argument is
that it is not good for children
to take on the vaccine risk
when the risk that you're trying to
mitigate is so close to zero would that
would that capture your argument
anybody does that capture your argument
pretty well okay i get i'm getting yeses
on that
all right here's the counter argument
do you think there is one
do you think there's a counter argument
there is
and it's the argument coming from the
government
and it's a pretty good one
but they don't say it
out loud
because they can't
so
here's my take i think the government
has an actual pretty good argument which
is different from saying i agree
all right so i'm not going to agree with
the government argument
i'm going to simply explain it
as best i can
and then i want you to reassess your
opinion
based on new information okay
would you say it's true or false that a
child would be damaged by
the death of let's say one parent
true or false
the child's well-being
would be damaged by the death of a
parent
true right true
is the point of vaccinating children
to only protect the children
was that ever the point of it
did the government ever say we're going
to vaccinate the children strictly for
the protection of the children
never said that
right
i believe it was always part of the
overall strategy
of getting enough people to some kind of
herd immunity wasn't it
so
i believe the government's argument goes
something like this
again
this is not me agreeing with the
argument i'm just representing it
because you should see here both
arguments
if we let the pandemic spread through
the normal adult public a lot of
children would lose
a parent
now you could argue what what is a lot
right but you know maybe
let's say let's say if we didn't do any
mitigation at all
and let's say well let's be more
specific let's say we vaccinated adults
mostly but no children
and then the virus sweeps through the
children and it becomes you know they
spread it to the adults and even some of
them vaccinated my diet
not many
but the the argument is
um
scott do you really think we affected
the spread at all almost certainly
but not maybe in the long run
you know omicron's going to get us all
but i do think we probably pushed off
some of the delta that we could have had
there's no way to know right
but i would say that if you do all the
things that logically should have made a
difference
it's hard to imagine that none of them
did
and you know if you're looking at small
percentages as being something useful
you know it's always hard to tell anyway
um i would argue that the uh would you
let me let me ask you this
if uh if the economy goes down let's say
the gdp
and unemployment goes up
is that good or bad for children
if the economy does
less good than it could be good or bad
for children i'd say it's bad right and
pair and children get it the worst
because poverty really hits a kid hard
so the argument for vaccinating kids is
that we are intentionally
putting the young at a little extra risk
to benefit the older population
because and here's the part the
government doesn't say directly
because that's how you protect the
children
protecting the adults
is how you protect the children
it's just indirect
now it does absolutely
put children at the extra risk from the
vaccination itself
we all agree on that right
but the presumed trade-off is not the
kid's health
the real argument is the health of
society because society's health will
have a big impact on the kids
now
having said that
do you say to yourself yes scott but
society does not
does
not disadvantage the young to benefit
the old
right
we don't kill kids
to save old people
am i right
no of course we do we do it all the time
we massively do that
we've always
killed kids to benefit the old
this isn't new
this is the most basic thing society
does have you heard of the national debt
anybody
who's going to pay the national debt
it's not my old ass
i'm driving up the debt so i can live a
good life and you know leave children in
poverty
right we're doing that intentionally and
massively
we could not be damaging children more
than we are
those who believe that climate change is
catastrophic
does that mean that we you know raped
the earth and left destruction for the
children
well there's a big part of the public
who thinks we did exactly that
and is okay with it
uh how about
the
military
now we have a volunteer military right
now
but
if the came down it wouldn't be
voluntary for long
i mean if we got into a real war
like a big one
it's not going to be voluntary for a
minute
you know the
you're going to be drafted right away
so
every military is about young people
sacrificing for the older generation
every bit of debt is the same thing
every time we increase the social
security payments which increases the
debt sometimes
it's the same thing
all right uh what about abortion
is abortion good for the children
or is this something that uh
older people do that's bad for the fetus
you were waiting for that were you took
me long enough to get there didn't it
i know that i know that was the argument
you were waiting for
so
let me back up and be really clear
i i'm uncomfortable vaccinating children
like i'm i'm not going to be the one to
tell you that was the right decision
okay
but i think the government has a better
argument than you give it credit for
a much better argument than you give it
credit for
if if the government is trying to
protect the whole
as the way to protect children too
they do have an argument
it's not one i quite
i'm quite on board with
because
and why am i not on board with it by the
way
what makes me not on board with that
argument
fear fear
that's why
because
the the i would be afraid of directly
hurting the child
even if you gave me the argument that oh
but yeah yeah yeah i get it scott you
would be directly hurting some children
because there's always somebody who's
going to get hurt by a vaccination but
you have to look at the big picture
scott in the big picture people are
better off
nope
i can't get there
my brain can't get past
but you're hurting a child
right
so
the fact that my brain can't get past
but you're directly hurting a child
no way i can't i can't be okay with that
i can't think of this rationally
and i can tell you directly why i can't
because i know there's no way i'm going
to rationally
weigh the life of a child
i can't
i don't have that capability if you
think you do you're just kidding
yourself you can't
all right how about uh
here's somebody else who said you did
not use fear for his decision
he said in order to travel
internationally for my business which i
must do i needed to get the vaccine in
order to avoid mandatory quarantine
rules
so he says tell me scott where is the
fear in my decision mine was pure reason
do you agree with that here's somebody
who used pure reason simply needed the
vaccine for business travel
and wanted to avoid inconvenience of
quarantines
no fear at all wasn't afraid of the
virus wasn't afraid of the shot
no fear at all
no he was afraid of losing his job
this is uh this tweet is how to say
you're afraid without saying you're
afraid
of course he was afraid of something but
he never felt fear
because he had a way out
right
so i would agree in you know maybe some
technical way that he avoided any actual
feeling of fear
so when he says where was my fear i
agree there wasn't any
because he had a path
that in his opinion avoided the thing he
feared
which is losing his job
um
viva fry said uh
oh i did another tweet in which i was
talking about the uh what we do and we
don't know about
the virus
um and uh
viva fry was uh
questioning
whether uh there's any evidence to
suggest that vaccinations reduce the
time one is infectious
what do you think
is there evidence
that a vaccinated person
would spread it less than an
unvaccinated person
uh you're all wrong
all right so there was a piece of fake
data that convinced everybody that
vaccinated people spread it the same as
unvaccinated
the fake data
which was based on true facts but the
way it was
the way it was presented
is misleading the fake data is that
vaccinated people tested had the same
viral load as unvaccinated people
and then that was generalized to oh i
guess you can spread it
the same
except that we also know that people who
are vaccinated clear the virus faster
so if both the vaccinated and the
unvaccinated peak at the same amount of
viral load
which is what you've all heard
and i think it's true
but one of them declines fast and the
other one doesn't
which one would spread it more
i'm saying not true
but
can can you
[Music]
uh what about the immunes
uh vaccinated and unvaccinated or
treated the same in terms of isolation
yeah probably shouldn't but they are
um
okay well that's that's the argument and
um i believe that uh a hundred percent
of science agrees with what i just said
i'm making a big claim
and i gave that as an absolute to see if
you can
refute it right so i'm being provocative
by saying this is an absolute
in my understanding and i want you to
prove me wrong
because if you could prove me wrong i
would find that exciting
i mean it would be fun to be proved
wrong on this question
prove me wrong
i say a hundred percent of all the data
that we have
suggests that vaccinated people clear
the virus faster
check check just that
they clear it faster that that's just
the only thing you're checking
i i agree with the fact that the viral
load can be similar at the peak i'm only
arguing that one side clears faster
that's all
all right um
so
i all i did was google that question and
it popped right up
so um
i don't know why that's a question
actually
um there's a story that uh the biden
administration got this very credible
uh i um suggestion from a bunch of
people in the know
that they should in october they were
supposed to rapid rapidly fire up the
the rapid tests
but the administration decided to focus
on vaccines
and not go nuts with rapid testing
and now biden belatedly said oh i wish
i'd started earlier
and this is in vanity fair now vanity
fair as you know or you should know
is a very pro-democrat publication it's
an anti-trump publication
and uh
vanity fair is basically saying that the
the biden administration failed totally
and was was told clearly was told how to
do it you know it was all scoped down
here's what you need to do so that we
have lots of tests for christmas and he
didn't do it
and
do you think that incompetence can
explain that
do you think that incompetence
can explain why it didn't happen in
october
here's the tricky thing
i've told you about radical compliance
or extreme compliance as a way to stop
something you don't like
i feel like somebody in the
decision-making process
is following the rules during the
pandemic because following the rules
is making something happen
in other words keeping these tests out
of the market is good for somebody
find out who
because that's why we don't have them
the reason we don't have the tests
is because it's good for somebody that
we don't have them and that means money
follow the money
and what you find is you'll find a bunch
of bureaucrats who followed all the
rules and broke no law
do you see what's going on here
in order for a bureaucrat
let's say um hypothetically
let's say there was hypothetically some
member of the fda or somebody in the
decision-making chain
who wanted to stop
tests from being available
maybe they took a bribe from the
vaccination companies
maybe they took a bribe for one of the
approved early approved
test companies
i'm not saying any of that happened i'm
just saying work through it in your mind
what would it look like
when you look to find the corruption
what would it look like
it would look like following the rules
because all you'd have to do is just you
use the regular fda process and you
could guarantee that nothing got it
approved on time
right the reason we have uh vaccinations
quickly is that trump just kicked asses
until they change their process
but nobody kicked their ass to change
their process when it came to
making testing available
so all they did was follow the process
and then they said you know we should
have been better funded i sure wish this
wasn't so slow
but i guess we'll have to follow the
process and keep you all protected
the fact that they did not break their
process during the pandemic
is the is the best proof of corruption
you'll ever see
a hundred percent of the people involved
knew
that this was a pandemic and this was
the time
to reassess which of these procedures
make sense in an emergency
they did not do any of that
right
there's no reporting at all
that the government even once
considered bending the rule and putting
you know tests up to the top of the list
not even once
why
corruption
now i think that the government probably
couldn't see it
like if you were the boss
and you were in charge and you said okay
why is this taking so long
you would say all right everybody let's
have a meeting can you explain to me why
this is taking so long
and everybody in the meeting would give
you a reason that actually sounds really
good
there's a good reason it's taking so
long we're making sure it's done right
but all of those reasons applied to
vaccinations and we did it anyway
i don't think there was even a
conversation about bending the rules for
tests
there is corruption here it's obvious
it's glaring it's glowing
but it's also possible nobody broke the
law
weirdly all you'd have to do is follow
the existing procedures and you could
stop anything from happening
i've done it myself
i can stop something just by following
the rules
i have done it in my corporate days
quite a bit actually
cnn is actually saying that biden is
confused
uh he talked about uh ordering the
500
million test kits but he confused it
with a separate conversation about
therapeutic pills which were similar
numbers i guess
and at some point he realized he had
confused them and corrected it and but
even cnn is calling him out now for
being confused
and
it didn't look like he even understood
the topic
that well i have to admit biden's doing
better than i thought he would do
when he explains things in public even
when he gets confused like this
you know these are easy things to
confuse
i feel like he's better than i thought
i had pretty low expectations but i
don't think he's up to it just better
than i thought
so here's a summary of the
pandemic
that we'll always look back at the
pandemic
and i think what we'll be proud
that we saved the lives of so many obese
americans at the cost of our
children and our freedom
now why is it that we can't say that we
saved the fat
to save at the cost of the young
and the healthy
why can't we say that out loud
because we're too woke right
the trouble is wokeness just ruins
everything
the fact as many people on social media
have said the fact that biden
is not telling us to
exercise and lose weight
especially because he's actually a good
role model for exactly that
biden's been a healthy fit
weight
all the way to like nearly 80.
i mean that's a really good role model
he should take advantage of that
i mean we should be hearing about that
all the time
uh
anyway
how in the world is china going to host
the olympics
without crashing their economy
do you think that now i i did see from
uh
my
my nemesis chen who is on twitter we
interact a lot and uh twitter actually
labels uh him as china state affiliated
media
now chen has informed me that he is not
a chinese operative because he watched
my live stream he's not a chinese
operative he's just a journalist and has
been a journalist for a long time
i probably would have preferred a
chinese operative over a journalist but
that's just me that's just me
and
bachchan who is part of a china
state-affiliated media his opinions are
totally his own
totally his own he has not influenced
one bit
by
the mother country
not one bit
and he would like you to know that
um and he even says that the olympics
won't be a problem because china's so
efficient and uh
they've got things worked out in terms
of spectators and movement so they will
limit the
transmission to which i say my nose is
itching by the way sorry about that
um
to which i say
how is that possible
are you telling me that you're not going
to get one person with at least omicron
into that country who's even though
they're tested you know you assume
they're tested and quarantined and
everything but even with that
you don't think a little omicron is
going to get in there and once it gets
in there
won't the olympics just crash the whole
thing
and how many countries want to send
their athletes into that
toxic stew and then have them come home
and infect the home country
i feel like
i feel like the olympics
might destroy china
but they can't cancel the olympics can
they because they would lose face
if china canceled the the olympics it
would make it seem as if they can't
handle covid and the olympics but they'd
like you to believe they can do both
i feel like
china is hoping or maybe half hoping
that other countries will cancel the
olympics
so here's what to look for
dr dr dixon gayford
you don't look like a real person
i'm gonna block you
you look like a troll
um
so
here's what to look for look for the
chinese government
to
act as though they kind of hope other
countries pull out of the olympics so
they can cancel it i think they want to
cancel it but they don't want to be the
ones that cancel it
i think they want other countries to say
oh it looks too dangerous can we
postpone this and then they'll say ah
well if nobody's going to come
you know if we're not going to have a
full house i guess we'll have to cancel
it or postpone it
so i've got a feeling that china's got a
really big problem
and i don't know which way this is going
to go
but apparently japan just said they're
not going to send government people to
the olympics
it's not quite a boycott they're just
not going to send government people to
it
which china noticed by the way
jenny says no they don't want to cancel
well i'm not saying they want to cancel
like with all of all of their heart and
soul
i'm saying that they might be a little
bit on the fence about it
meaning that there's there are probably
some people there
who don't care about the olympics but
they do care about not crashing china's
economy
so they might be saying to themselves
you know
don't want to cancel them but if they
got cancelled i wouldn't complain too
hard
didn't they cancel the olympics in 80
uh i don't know
do we want a functioning global economy
and no war yeah
it is the best live stream every day you
are right jonathan i'm glad you noticed
all right um
the u.s pulled out in 80.
where was it when we pulled down
what country
oh russia okay
um
if they run out of food they'll be
coming for ours well there there's that
problem
all right uh let us uh
let us end here
um i didn't mean to talk about nothing
but
coronavirus but i feel like
yeah when you get these slow news
periods that
is going to be you know whatever is
already out there it's not going to be
new news it's just going to be more of
whatever whatever is out there
well
boo is doing great thanks for asking
2021 recap
yeah
um i still have a few more days to do
the recap
but
i'll probably be calling out some people
who
were especially productive and useful
on twitter
because i don't know if you know it or
probably you do know it but there's
there's sort of a
self-organized
army of people who send me
things every day on twitter
which
is amazing because i get to see sort of
the filtered good stuff so most of
people are sending me things are really
good at filtering
and that allows me to you know give you
better stuff here and maybe change the
world a little bit
all right um
there's a recent schellenberger tweet
string with good news okay i'll go check
that out
all right
that's all for today and i will talk to
you
tomorrow
