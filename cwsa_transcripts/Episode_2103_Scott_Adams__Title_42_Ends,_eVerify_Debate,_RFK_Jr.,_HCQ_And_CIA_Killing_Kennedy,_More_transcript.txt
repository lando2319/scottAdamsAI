do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adamson aren't
you glad you made it those of you
watching this live are having the
experience of your life
those of you watching it recorded well
you wish you were here when it was live
I'm sorry but it'll still be great if
you'd like to take it up to a level that
nobody could ever even imagine was
possible all you need is a copper mug or
a glass a tanker to Chalice of Stein a
canteen Joker flask a vessel of any kind
if fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dope in the
end of the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it ends with a big
ah don't forget that part go
ah
satisfying so satisfying
all right well
I continue to be amused by the best
entertainment on the internet which is
when Twitter's Community notes slap
somebody down
I'm still waiting for it to happen to me
I don't think it's happened to me yet
that I'm aware of
but apparently Randy weingard who's the
head of the biggest teachers union she's
now on her sixth Community notes
correction
six times in a row I think it's all the
same topic
I believe she's claiming
uh let's say does she put more energy
into opening schools than the critics
say is correct
so it's a question of whether she was
working hard to open schools or was she
working hard to keep them closed for the
benefit of the teachers
so she's got a story that she's trying
to sell that she was really trying to do
the right thing for everybody
and maybe that's true but Community
notes is having none of it so they're
fact checking the hell out of her
if you got fact checked by Community
notes
uh six times would you keep tweeting
I think it would be time to stop
tweeting after that sixth time
but boy there's vicious on her all right
title 42 ends Thursday that's that uh
coven related rule that allowed some
degree of Border controls now they're
many many many many
uh potential immigrants waiting to come
over
and I guess Texas is sending
reinforcements to the border and
uh federal government Biden sending
reinforcements to the border to handle
all these people
and here's a question I have
are those reinforcements there to turn
people back
or are they just processing them
because they're all going to have legal
claims right aren't they all going to
come in and say I'm uh I'm not an
illegal immigrant
I'm escaping bad things so I need
what's that called uh
uh uh what's it called when you come oh
Asylum yeah I need Asylum
so in theory all those reinforcements
are not there to stop people from coming
are they
or are they there just do more
efficiently process them as they come in
I don't I don't think they're there to
stop anything they might be guiding them
from illegal Crossings to
the legal Crossings or something but
here's a question I have this is this is
a
gives you an idea what weird things
enter my head
so we know that it's mostly the coyotes
beating the cartels or behind all this
human trafficking
so for every huge group of immigrants
trying to come across there's some
cartel person who's in charge
now here's a business question
if you have stopped at the border
does the cartel offer a rebate
or do they do they say all right we we
promise we'd get you across the border
and you've already paid us
and they stopped you at this one border
crossing but we'll just take you in
another one because you've paid
well see see most of you are most of you
are reflexively saying that there's no
refunds are you sure
are you sure
I'm not sure because the cartels are
such a business at this point that you
actually wonder if they've started
adopting
any normal business
principles would you not be more likely
to pay the cartels
if you knew that they would try a second
time if you got caught or they'd re
refund your money
right
so it might be from a purely business
perspective they might get more business
if they look like they're a good you
know firm to work with oh yeah we'll
give you a rebate if it doesn't work and
we'll try two or three times
it probably doesn't cost them that much
to try a second time
right I'm just wondering if you assume
that they're not acting like a regular
business
you're probably right
probably right you know they'll take
what they can get but they might
actually be
running it like a regular business it
might actually have rebates
and like discounts and if you leave
today 20 off
I mean why wouldn't they
if it works in the every other business
context why would it work on this one
I know I guess the only reason it
wouldn't work is if you knew these
people were all going to pay a large
amount of money and try no matter what
if people are going to come no matter
what and they were going to pay a
massive amounts well then they don't
have to offer any deals
but maybe they get more
if they offer a good deal all right
that's just my weird thought
uh so DeSantis picked up some more free
money and by that I mean he did
something that seems obvious but only
after he does it
and then you say to yourself why didn't
everybody do that
so
desensis of course is trying to do
things in Florida that would have some
national looking impact so that it you
know helps them in Florida but also
helps them if he runs for office which
people think he will
I still I'm still not convinced he's
gonna announce
I still think it's a jump ball on that
could go either way
I think he's waiting to the last minute
to make sure
and it probably just depends on Trump's
legal problems and poll numbers
I'm guessing it just depends on that all
right so what uh DeSantis did in Florida
is there some new legislation here
preventing uh
uh
Chinese citizens from owning stuff in
Florida except small properties and they
can't have it near Military
facilities and
um let's see
so there's a few other things he's going
to prevent China from doing in Florida
but I guess this would apply to some
other countries such as Cuba and North
Korea basically Florida doesn't want
foreign influence
in their education system
or ownership
of their too much of their property you
could have a little bit but they don't
want to
basically they just don't want this for
an influence in their state
now who would be against that yeah this
seems like free money because when you
describe it it just sounds like an
obvious thing to do
just seems obvious
so good for him that looks smart all
right here's the issue which I cannot
come up with an opinion on yet and I'll
tell you why it's really complicated
so Thomas Massey is tweeting against the
e-verify idea
which the e-verify would be a digital
way for all immigrants
to be in a system
and if they're not in the system they
can't get jobs
and the idea is that if people can't get
jobs
they'll self-deport because they're
coming here for jobs
now
let's go through just and also part of
e-verify
um
sort of unrelated but related is that
the U.S is looking toward maybe a fully
digital currency
so if you had a digital currency so
every transaction could be tracked and
you had e-verify
which eventually will apply to Americans
as well as immigrants one assumes
then the government would have
complete control that by pushing a
button or two they could just turn off
your access to civilization
which is a lot of power for your
government
that's a lot of power
now Thomas Massey white reasonably warns
us that giving the government any new
powers is dangerous and these specific
new powers are probably extra dangerous
because they're going to be watching
everything you do and they can punish
you with one button
so that's that's the reason not to do it
but if you don't do it
you'll be far far harder to know if
anybody's working in the U.S illegally
because it's easier to get you know fake
paper documents I guess it would be
harder for the to get the fake digital
documents
so
and I saw one story that's that says
that Florida already has problems at
construction sites because they already
have e-verified
can somebody fact check me on that did
Florida already implement e-verify
I see a confirmation yes
and it's already having an effect that
employers can't get employees
and construction companies are sort of
shutting down because they can't even
operate
now that's what would happen in
California
in California if everyone who was here
illegally
suddenly needed to be verified to even
work
that would be the end of
I don't know 30 percent of all
businesses in California
it's a big number small businesses so I
would guess that 30 of all small
businesses in California would instantly
shut
if we had you verify
because that's how we illegal the
systems it we have a very mature illegal
system
where it's somewhat easy for people to
get fake documents and under the current
system if you present fake documents to
your employer the employer is off the
hook did you know that the employer
doesn't have any obligation if they've
seen documents
because they're not supposed to be
experts on fake documents they're just
supposed to ask for them confirm that
they got them you know document that
they got the documents and then the the
employer is out of trouble
there's no legal risk after that you
just have to check the documents but
with e-verify I guess that changes
and my assumption is that you would have
to have somebody to verify in order to
have them as an employee
I'm guessing that's where it's going so
because otherwise would be no point to
it
um
so what do you think of this
do you think this is a slippery slope
that will be bad for all of us
or is it inevitable so you could argue
about it all day long but it won't make
any difference it's just going to happen
anyway
or is it a bad argument
so I tweeted back to Thomas Massey
who who tweet I'll give you his tweet
first he said
Thomas Massey said representative Massey
said I hear people say you verify it
will be so effective at denying
employment to illegals that millions of
them will self-deport for he verified to
work that well would require biometric
proof of identity for every American
and a cashless Society
and which is scary he says is this what
you want for your children
what do you think of that argument so
the argument
would be you know it's not just about
the undocumented immigrants it's also
about it's going to be all of us putting
our biometric information in there so
our fingerprints and our face prints and
all that stuff what about that
well
let me give you the best counter
argument I can
I don't have an opinion on this yet
I I might form one
but it's very unpredictable
so that my first part of the opinion is
it's Unstoppable
so therefore the argument
is almost irrelevant
it's Unstoppable
there there's no way we're going to be
using pieces of paper to pay people in a
hundred years
does anybody think we're going to be
paying people with pieces of paper in a
hundred years
there's no way to stop it
does anybody think that biometric
identification won't be the standard in
100 years
I mean we might be cyber cyborgs by then
but none of this is stoppable
does anybody think it's stoppable
it might be you slow downable you might
be able to delay it and maybe you want
to but none of this is stoppable so
that's the first the first part of my
argument is you can't stop something
with this much utility
that's the problem
the problem is that it's just too useful
for the government but people will find
benefit too
have you already reached the point where
writing a check
feels like you traveled back in time and
you're churning your own butter
all right
well the last time somebody asked you
for a cash payment with like dollar
bills
that was some you know largest amount
Beyond you know beyond forty dollars
didn't it feel just like ridiculous
because you've got venmo right you've
got PayPal you've got you know Google uh
Google pay
ing anybody a small amount of money with
money feels like I just went back in
time or something
so let me explain my own situation and
this will give you some insight
uh take me personally as a public figure
would you agree that I don't have the
option of hiding my identity in any
practical way would you agree
because I'm a public figure
right if I walked in some place without
my wallet
I could just say Google me
right
there's no doubt who I am
I'm 100 easily identical identifiable
with anybody who has a phone
yeah so you say you're Scott Adams huh
so you say so you say you're Scott does
we'll see well yeah you are Scott Adams
yeah obviously here's a 900 pictures of
you right here yep here's you talking
let's hear you talk yeah that's you
all right so
in a in an inefficient way
I've already been living in e-verify
life
which is my biometrics
literally the way I look
has already been identifying me for
decades and I can't go anywhere without
anybody who has a phone being able to
look at me and just check
now if you had a facial identification
app even easier
click
now that's individuals right
so you're saying but Scott that's
individuals it's different than the
government well I'm also using a system
for travel called the clear system have
you heard of that you go to the airport
and you just show it your face and your
eyeballs and that's your identification
and then you go to the front of the line
so my Biometrics already exists in that
system
do you think the government could get
access to it if it wanted
oh yeah it just needs a reason it just
needs a reason that's all and they could
ask for it
um
with my phone
when I turn on my apps usually I'm using
facial recognition
so Apple knows my face it's already got
my Biometrics in there you used to have
my fingerprint
probably that's still stored somewhere
because the old phones use my
fingerprint right
so I'm a person whose identity has been
public for years
and I can't really hide
I don't have that option
and and the money that I spend has
already moved from
a fair amount of it was Cash
you know actual dollar bills at one
point in my life you know those paying
people who are doing work whatever
but at this point It's All Digital
I can't remember the last time I reached
in my wallet and took out a piece of
paper
do you have the same experience it just
sort of doesn't happen
I don't pay with anything with a piece
of paper
so the only reason I have any pieces of
paper
is for you know very just random stuff
this is not even like a normal use
right now some of you are not where I am
so I'm not I'm not saying that my
situation applies to you here's the
point I'm going to make
I already live in a world where I have
no privacy
and my Biometrics are already recorded
in a variety of ways and I already only
use digital money
so all of my transactions can be tracked
has it been a problem
what problems have I encountered because
of that
I can't think of one
now it doesn't mean that you wouldn't
have a problem and it doesn't mean that
I won't have one someday and it doesn't
mean it wouldn't be worse if everybody
were in my situation right so you could
do a whole population not just one
person
but how about uh how about the idea that
if everybody's in this digital currency
and e-verify
that the government could just push a
button and and turn off your money
you realize that I got canceled globally
right
I got canceled globally
you know the Dilbert comic and it didn't
take any work at all
there was no effort whatsoever
we already have a way to cancel people
completely
right
now I only got canceled from things I
wanted to cancel me from they didn't
need to take me out of all civilization
because they don't need me to starve
right it if the government had turned
off all of my ability to make money or
interact with the world what would I
have done in response
I would have become a criminal
immediately
what else what do you do there's no
other option right so the government I
don't think the government is going to
want to create criminals
so even though the government could you
know tweak your money turn it off turn
it on control your employment
they'll think they want to
because it doesn't help them to create
new criminals if you're only option is
to rob somebody for money let me put it
this way if the government ever made it
so the only way I could make money is by
robbing people
I would Rob people
in a heartbeat
wouldn't you
I'd be robbing people every day
I mean until like I caught I suppose
yeah but I might also try to throw a
foment a revolution against the
government
at the same time I was robbing people
I'd probably be forming a
militia to attack the government
you know if they took me out completely
they would have created a super enemy
that they wouldn't want
so
here's what I predict
I don't think the government's going to
want to turn people's money off
completely with the rare exceptions of
perhaps like a let's say a criminal
who's on the Run
it might be a good way to Catch a
Criminal on the run but they're not
going to want to do it to people who
just have an option of working
if you have an option of having a job
the government wants you to make money
and pay rent and pay taxes so I don't
know that they're ever going to want to
turn it off it doesn't make anybody it
does make sense for anybody
all right so I'm going to agree with
Thomas Massey that the risk is real
and unknown
and you should be very cautious about
going into any situation where the risk
is real
potentially very large and unknown
however the counter argument is
there's nothing to stop it
there's no way in 100 years you're going
to be paying for things with pieces of
paper you carried in your pocket right
I'm not even going to listen to that
argument
and likewise your Biometrics are all
getting into the system in a variety of
ways you know we're probably
we're probably one week away from AI
being able to identify you every time
you know that right
Biometrics might not even make any
difference
do you know that if I if if AI wanted to
identify me
because I'm a public figure with a large
body of writing
I could talk to AI for 10 minutes
it could check my answers against all
the ways I've ever answered questions or
written things in the past because as a
large body of my work to pull from and
it would now
there's no way there's no way I could
artificially choose words
over an extended let's say a 10 minute
conversation in which I could avoid
being me
I only know how to speak one way
like even if I tried to pretend it would
be obvious I was pretending
so we may be appointed because of AI
where the whole identification thing
doesn't even matter
you know because AI will just know who
you are and where you are and it'll just
know you basically
so I'm going to say that
um I'm less afraid of this than Thomas
Massey
but his concerns are valid
which is not quite an opinion yet
to because to be an opinion I think I'd
need to get closer to we should do it or
we should not do it or we should delay
it I'm not there yet I'm recognizing the
the weight of his opinion
but I'm I'm not persuaded yet could be
I'm open to be persuaded on this
now here's what I tweeted back to
representative Massey one of my all-time
favorite politicians because he actually
tells the truth and he's smart
um
I advised him in a tweet I said that his
argument needs a story to be persuasive
and ideally a story that conjures up a
visual
because if you tried to persuade
somebody you don't want to use just a
conceptual argument such as do you want
your children to grow up in this world
foreign
like so I'm imagining a child
and then I might then I'm imagining that
my child is always easily identified
does that scare me
does it scare me that my child if
they're stolen from me can can be easily
identified as my stolen child
no that sounds kind of good
that my child will always be easily
identified no matter what context
and you can't change their identity you
couldn't change it if you wanted to
does that sound bad and then how about
that world where I'm paying everything
with digital currency
you do you think you can convince me
that paying for things with just a few
punches of a button is worse for me than
having to go to the ATM and get pieces
of paper to carry around in my pocket
it's not an argument
that has a feeling to it
do you understand that the concept you
can understand intellectually and I can
agree that there are risks there and
they're pretty big
I see that
but it doesn't that that concept doesn't
come into my body and if it doesn't come
into my body physically and can be like
a fear or a Elation or something
I'm not going to be persuaded
so here's what I would need
for the Massey argument to be persuasive
he needs to say all right here's your
here's your scenario
uh you did X and then the government did
X to you are you okay with that
no maybe yes maybe no maybe I disagree
with this example but that would be
visual
so for example it's like okay you go to
the ATM and it doesn't work
because you said something on social
media that the government thought was
inappropriate
so now your money is blocked because of
speech
now I don't know if that's a good
example
which is why I'm asking him for an
example because I don't know if there is
an example what exactly is the story
where where I run into trouble because
there's digital payments and the
government e-verifies
but what about the trucker rally
they turned off their digital money
but but you're making my point not their
point see your point is that in the
current system the truckers had their
money turned off I'm saying that the
current system already allows you to
turn off anybody's money
the government can turn off any Bank
they just have to have a reason
right so your argument is actually
supporting my case that we already live
in a place where anybody's money can be
turned off by the government
okay anyway
this is deep as we can get on that
uh
continuing to like uh Vivek ramaswamy he
appeared on I think it was Fox and uh he
had this to say I'm going to quote it he
said we're literally addicted to China
they push fentanyl via cartels across
our Southern border they push digital
fentanyl via tick tock
digital fentanyl very good uh
blackmailing Young Americans our
national debt is basically Financial
Fentanyl
and Vivek says the real Declaration of
Independence uh for the 21st century is
from the CCP
it's pretty good framing
the Declaration of Independence is from
China
that we need a new American Revolution
now that's
that's good persuasion
right because the Declaration of
Independence
don't you think of that as physical
I don't know maybe it's just me but I
actually see the piece of paper and I
see that the people with the old wigs
signing it and stuff
and and then I see the entire
Revolutionary War
you know I see the actual you know the
red outfits and the the marching with
the with the guns and stuff so that's a
very visual Declaration of Independence
if you're an American it's very visual
because you've been trained with all
those images
so that's good persuasion and then he's
uh he's packaging the uh addiction and
Fentanyl argument into finance and Tick
Tock and I like all of that
that's all good persuasion and it was so
good and because I'm a single issue
voter I retweeted his request for um
campaign donations
so
we'll see how he does now here's
something interesting RFK Jr is making
great interesting stories
so one story is that he's he's still
saying in public
that he believes the CIA was involved in
killing President Kennedy
his uncle
now
apparently he refers to tons of evidence
that was collected that all points in
the same direction but the story that
really got my attention
was according to RFK Jr
RFK
when when the president was assassinated
the president's brother who was already
attorney general right
he was attorney general at the time
the Attorney General of the United
States according to RFK Jr
called his contacts at the CIA to ask if
they did it
because he believed that was the most
obvious
people who did it
just just hold that in your mind
I'm not saying that the CIA did it I'm
not saying they did
I'm saying that the Attorney General
believed they did
you don't you could even take out the
part where they did or they did not
the person who knew the most about how
the country work really works
is the attorney general
I would argue that no one knows more
than the Attorney General
how really works in the real world
am I wrong
there's nobody who understands the real
workings of the government better than
the Attorney General
and the Attorney General
thought the CAA probably killed his
brother the president of the United
States
just hold that in your head for a minute
and that as of today RFK Jr still
believes it and also believes that the
evidence is very clear and convincing
enough so that he's got some confidence
in saying he's not crazy
right he has proven himself to be a good
you know analyst of complicated stuff
so
that's just amazing it just blows my
mind
and then when we saw that the
intelligence agents you know did their
fake letter about the Hunter
laptop you say to yourself
has anything changed
has anything changed and then you ask
yourself who told Sydney Powell that
there was a kraken coming and it had
something to do with Venezuela and uh
election machines and some General in
Venezuela where do you think that came
from
who knows but if that did not come from
some intelligence agency in the United
States I'd be really surprised don't
know don't know for sure
but I'd be really surprised if that's
not them
all right
um
so we do have a problem in this country
is that we don't know who's running the
country
it's kind of a big problem isn't it
I honestly don't know
because we say we tell ourselves it's
the Democrats right it's Obama and
whatever but I actually don't know like
legitimately
honestly legitimately I don't know
I don't know if the Democrats or
Republicans or anybody is in charge it
could be
entirely
the CIA it could be
just don't know
all right or they just or they just
anticip it could be that the CIA just
participates in lots of things you don't
know about but that would be short of
controlling everything
all right we'll talk more about uh RFK
Jude in a minute
well right now how about
um
he also was called out uh in some
interview about his opinions on
hydroxychloroquine
and the the nature of the questions was
hey you conspiracy theory Nut Job you've
been saying that hydroxychloroquine you
know might actually work but all the
science
says it doesn't and I'd never heard
anybody give a really good answer to
that I never heard anybody who was
pro-hydroxychloroquine
who explained it their position as well
as he did
so I'm still in the camp of the evidence
does not show it works
but maybe it doesn't show it doesn't
work either
so his uh his claim got this and I'm not
gonna I'm not going to back his claim
I'm just going to say it's the best
explanation that I've heard
that if you looked at all the
hydroxychloric wind space there are
three big randomized controlled trials
that look like the good ones
the good ones show it definitely doesn't
work meaning that the the deaths were
greater in the treated group than the
untreated group
did you know that that the three real
solid randomized controlled trials
just show higher depth if you use it
but here's what RFK Jr points out about
those three studies
they all use the same dosage rate
and it was all wildly beyond what any
reasonable doctor would give somebody
because you know it would kill them
or you know it put them at risk for
death so it was a the only thing that
was tested in those high quality studies
was a toxic level of it
now I I've heard other people say of
course that the studies were designed to
fail they've been hearing that forever
right so that so that was so far this is
just a common argument the studies are
bad the studies were designed to fail
but here here's why his argument is
stronger
he said he points out in detail the
three studies tells you that all three
of them use the same dose level which
automatically is very suspicious
because the dose level that all three of
them used
was something that an ordinary doctor
would look at and say oh no that's way
too much
and where did that come from
it seems like a little bit too much of a
coincidence that the three trials that
were the good ones the ones with a lot
of money behind them
that those are the ones where they did a
toxic level test now as RFK JR says if
you take those three out of the meta
studies and the meta-analysis would look
at all the studies that are flawed
but if you look at all the flawed
studies if they're flawed in different
ways you hope that those different ways
cancel out each other and maybe you can
tell something his argument is if you
take out the three studies they're
clearly wrong you end up with something
that looks like a positive result
what do you think of that argument
do you see any weakness in the argument
well I do
let me explain the weakness in the
argument
a meta study is a study of all studies
but you know what do you know what
people usually do when they do a meta
study
they say well all of the studies are
maybe a little bit weak or flawed or
underpowered but when we add them
together
you know that'll tell us something
but there's something they do before
they add them together do you know what
that is
they use their judgment to decide which
ones to remove from the study because
those ones are just so bad they have to
be removed
in other words it's not a science
if it were science I might back it it's
not science there's somebody who says I
will use my human judgment not science
not science I used by human judgment
because I know a little something about
this study but I know less about the
other studies
so just because I randomly know more
about this study and I know it's bad
I'll take it out
that's not science
that's not even close
so if you want to tell yourself that the
science shows hydroxychlorically and
works that is false
because of medicine meta-analysis is not
science if you want to use a if you want
to say that the science shows
hydroxychloroquine does work
that's not science either
so basically the mistake
that RFK Jr points out correctly which
is some of these big Studies have an
obvious problem
what about the ones that are left
they all have obvious problems so it's
basically nothing but studies that are
bad
how many bad studies can you add up to
get a good study I think the answer is
that's not a thing
right so while I would agree that his
um his defense of hydroxychloroquine
it's the best I've seen
for for a short tight
Public Defense
pretty solid pretty good job he's
persuasive but I'm not persuaded
so but to his credit to his credit he
only points at the evidence
he describes the evidence
you're still left with the question of
does it work or does it not but his his
criticism of how we decided it doesn't
his criticism of how we decided it
doesn't work is valid
so so I'm going to give him you know
three-quarters credit for a valid
analysis but I think there's another
level
that uh of uncertainty
so
that was interesting all right um
I think you're still hilarious that
reparations are being taken serious
seriously by anybody they're California
stuff and I've seen I've seen you know
tweets people saying uh actually Robert
Malone
you know Dr Malone famous from kova days
Dr Malone basically said unless you're a
person of color you should get out of
California
because of the reparations thing
can you believe that that like Dr Malone
one of the most famous people on social
media lately you just sat down right if
you if you're not a person to color you
should get out of California does that
sound like anything that somebody else
said
so it sound like that reminds me of
something
something I it's not coming to me
um
but
I can't believe
that we're letting this prank go on so
long
doesn't it feel like a prank on black
people
they really think they're going to get
reparations
you know that's not going to happen
right
is there even one person on this live
stream that thinks they're going to get
reparations at least the way it was
described were taxpayers just give them
a bunch of money in the check
now even if it's spread out over time or
anything no it's not going to happen
and the reason that you know why it's
not going to happen
it's too far
it's way too far
and it's just not going to happen
now if it did happen I would move out of
California and so would a lot of people
it would end it would just end the state
it would be there's no way that Newsome
could be considered a serious National
candidate if if California pays
reparations that's the end
would you agree that there's no way that
uh Newsome could become a national
politician run for president
if reparations go through under his
watch would you agree
that takes them out from being a
national politician
yeah
and I don't think he can stand for that
because he looks like he has some
Ambitions there
so
I feel it's cruel and probably dangerous
to let black people imagine that this is
going to happen and their imaginations
have been taken I would say
unethically too far
like to to let them imagine that this is
serious or that anybody's not laughing
about them behind their backs you know
I'm talking about the reparation
committee
to imagine yeah now remember I told you
that the biggest problem that black
Americans have
in my opinion is that they've trained
people not to tell them the truth
right look how many black Americans are
completely wasting their time on this
because there's no white American who
will tell them look them in the eye and
say you know you can study it all you
want it's not going to happen
not as long as I'm alive
do you know do you know how much energy
I would put into stopping this
yeah this is like clear your calendar
kind of stuff
yeah now this is not going to happen
this is not going to happen
and nobody will nobody will tell black
Americans anything honest
do you think it's in their best interest
to spend a bunch of time convincing
themselves that this is going to happen
is terrible for them
is not good for me but it's even worse
for them
for me it probably has no impact at all
because it's not going to happen
for them they're going to get all you
know worked up they're spent all this
time is for nothing it's all for nothing
and do you know why the white
politicians let you do it
because they couldn't tell you the truth
that's why because you've trained us
you've trained white people to lie to
you
so they did you got exactly what you let
you asked for now so far you might think
it's working it's like we're getting
exactly what we asked for we've got
those reparations committee this is
going well
no it's not it's a white trick
trust me I know white tricks
it's it's just to study it to make it
look ridiculous so it's easier to turn
it down
now the best thing that that happened
for nuisance perspective is that the
recommendations are absurd
and I think he knew that I think he knew
the recommendations would be absurd so
it's easier to turn down something
that's absurd but even better he doesn't
have to turn it down does he
no he can send them back to study it
better
and he can just keep doing it
do you think there's any end to how long
he can put them off just so you know
your committee recommendation is
interesting we're going to have to
commission a committee to look at it
all right so that's what's happening
there
so I told you about countercoa the great
thread
where at 2013 something suddenly
happened in the media and words such as
you know white privilege and systemic
racism went from hardly ever being used
in history to all the media was using it
all the time just massive spike in 2013
and then continuing on
so why
so I asked
so the the easy answer is that the media
did it
and the easier answer is that the medium
model changed so that you know
provocation got you more clicks and it's
just because the internet exists but I
think the internet existed before 2013.
and I think that
here's what I think
I saw a bunch of anti-Semitic people
saying Scott when you say the media
are you catching on are you catching on
wink wink the media George Soros the
media are you catching it now are you
getting it way quick no that's not where
I'm going
I do not believe and I you know I've
been behind behind the curtain enough
to know when something's complete
here's what's not happening
here's what what's not happening is the
uh the Jewish leaders of media companies
all getting together and saying let's do
some Jewish conspiracy stuff
that's not happening
that's not happening
you don't think I would know about that
seriously
I mean I I lived and breathed completely
in that world publishing
right media and Publishing that's where
I live it's the most Jewish environment
you could ever be in you don't think I
would have any hint
that it was a massive Jewish conspiracy
If there really was one
you don't think I would have picked up
on that
in like Decades of being completely
immersed in that environment
it's not a thing
it's not a thing there's a correlation
right there there's a high percentage of
Jewish you know owners and managers and
stuff in the media but
to imagine that therefore
you know they're all coordinating that's
not how anything works
you could also say that most of the
media managers are male
which I think is still true
but is it a male conspiracy
so a whole bunch of men in the media
right but are the men
you know coordinating to you know get
one over on the women
and the lgbtqs because they're
outnumbered
that's not happening there there are you
know there are other reasons external
reasons why there were a lot of men in
Media
and that's it
it's not part of a conspiracy of men
against women it's not a conspiracy of
Jewish media owners against anybody else
now are there individual members that
own the media who have you know A love
of Israel
sure
sure pretty normal
but it's not some giant conspiracy
so
who do you think is behind the sadly
media Spike
what's your guess sudden media spike in
uh
interest do you think well let me ask
you the first one do you think it was
organic
and organic would include the the
algorithms changed so people just
naturally wanted more of it and then the
media just gave them more of what they
clicked on
is it organic
doesn't feel organic does it some say
the colleges
but that the colleges doesn't explain
the 2013 Spike because it's too sudden
right college would be more of a you
know a long burn
to me there's only one thing that could
do this
only one thing
the CIA
I don't think anything else could do it
and is there any history in this country
of the CIA manipulating the media
oh yeah
it's like one of their primary functions
and correct me if I'm wrong it's
completely legal right
at the moment is completely legal for
the CIA to manipulate our media and our
minds
am am I wrong
it's not illegal
and and here's how it would happen
it would happen like this
somebody in the agency
would talk to publisher
and say hey
we'd really like to see more stories of
this type
and then the then the publisher of the
newspaper says oh I don't think so
right I don't see a market for that or
that feels like that feels like uh more
of a narrative than news
and then what does the CIA say
well
you know we have helped you in the past
quite a few times
well yes but what you're asking is sort
of unreasonable yeah yeah you know and
in the future we would be very friendly
with you as well there could be
opportunities that open for you
yeah and if those opportunities didn't
open well it's hard to know what would
happen to your business
yeah so you can imagine
there's not even a threat
it could even be less than that it could
be just we'll give you we'll give you
tips
uh here's the deal you get all of your
you know your news tips and Insider
stuff from us
I mean we've been keeping you in
business
we're just asking for this one small
thing
just give us some stories on this topic
all right so
um I don't know what caused that massive
Spike I do think that it could be a
change in the algorithms
somebody said that Facebook made some
kind of a change around then maybe I
think that's a uh possibility and then
the fact that people click makes more of
it Etc so it could be just a bunch of
things happened at the same time but I
would say the rapidity of it
suggests a intelligence operation
it's just what it looks like I have no
evidence beyond that
all right
um
what else we got here
there's a Rasmussen poll
that on RFK Jr and uh
53 percent of Democrats
and 61 percent of Republicans
have at least a somewhat favorable
opinion of RFK Jr
does that sound like a typo
let me say it again and watch your head
explode
all right RFK Jr is a Democrat
that's important to the story he's a
Democrat
53 percent of Democrats have a favorable
opinion of them but 61 percent of
Republicans
and 48 of uh not affiliated but those
are kind of fake
what's going on here
let me ask you this question
if this is true
that more Republicans than Democrats
like RFK but you know more than half of
the
Democrats also like him
if he got nominated
yes
how could he lose
I don't think you could lose if 61
percent of the other team thinks you're
pretty good
because your own team is going to vote
for you for sure right because they're
just not going to want the other teams
so even if if RFK Jr is not their first
choice as a Democrat they're all going
to vote for them
it's just whoever the candidate is
now that's mostly true of Republicans
but you only need a few people to cross
over
and it looks like he has them
it looks like he would actually get a
few people to cross over I I can tell
you that I've heard Republicans who have
been lifelong Republicans say this RFK
junior is interesting
have you
how many of you have heard you know Die
Hard Republicans and conservatives say
that they would give him a look they
would just give him a look
this is completely different than
anything you've seen in politics in a
long time I would say since Obama at
least Obama was like that in a sense
because I think there were people who
were more conservative said you know
what I'm going to give him a look
I'm just going to give them a look
at RFK juniors in that in that category
people are willing to give them a look
now it does make sense because he was
you know compatible on the coven
vaccination stuff
he believes the CIA killed Kennedy
that's pretty compatible with Republican
thinking at least some portion of
Republicans
um
he believes the borders should be
tightened
but he seems like he's actually serious
about it
like because he comes at it from a
logical place
I don't know
this guy's got a lot going for him that
Republicans are going to appreciate now
there are some big big wild cards I know
he's been anti-nuclear in the past
but I have not heard his updated nuclear
opinion and I would allow for people to
change their opinion I wouldn't hold it
against anybody if anybody went from you
know
anti-nuclear to Pro
I would only care that they're Pro now
and I might even give them a benefit for
being willing to change their mind like
it might even be a little bit of a plus
right
so I mean it would be better if they've
been here for a long time but I'm not
gonna I wouldn't hold it against anybody
that they got here eventually on nuclear
so I'd like to hear his update on that I
also haven't heard his Fentanyl
ideas and I'm a single issue voter on
that so
we'll wait for that
at the moment Vivek is the strongest on
Fentanyl and so he's got my support
um
I saw a tweet from
Ashley Sinclair
and she said this doctors hardly have
ever advised women that it may be their
birth control making them depressed or
even suicidal despite documented risk of
both on the pill instead they'll
describe an antidepressant
uh and that'll be your solution
imagine imagine being a woman
I guess for some of you that's easy
and you're on birth control the birth
control makes you sad and they give you
an antidepressant
you would have no libido left
should be capable of not getting
pregnant two different ways one is you
don't want to have any sex and the other
is if you did you wouldn't get pregnant
now this made me curious enough to do a
little searching because I said to
myself is it true that this link is well
established what do you think do you
think it's a well-established just a
medical fact
that birth control is associated with
depression
and it was something like a 30 greater
rate or something some big number
percentage difference
one article there was a Denmark study
and a big study because Denmark
apparently has good records of stuff so
you can study things there that you
can't study here
and accordingly they did find a big
percentage difference of of depression
of people who had any kind of
hormonal birth control but here's a
weird part
it included iuds
apparently people with iuds would get
depressed as well as people who took a a
chemical a pill
now that surprised people but then I
kept reading and it said that uh
normally uh 1.7 women out of 100 would
be depressed
so that was their Baseline but it went
from 1.7 and 100 to 2.2 which as a
percentage is pretty big difference
but it's still 2.2 out of a hundred
uh if there's something wrong with this
study isn't there
have you ever met a hundred women
you think you think if you randomly pick
a hundred women then only two of them
have depression
just two
out of a hundred
well maybe in Denmark
maybe they shouldn't be studying Denmark
so much I don't know is that true in
Denmark that only two out of 100 people
are depressed
in the United States it's at least 30
percent am I wrong
at least a third of women would say
they're depressed
or have some emotional mental problem
and I think that's low it could be way
more than that
so once again the studies and science
look worthless
so I don't think you can say anything
except that to me it seems obvious
here's my argument for why it's obvious
that it would make you depressed this is
the least medical argument you've ever
heard in your life
there will be no science
in what I say next and I'm still
confident of it
no science no studies no data to back it
still confident it goes like this
the single thing that humans are
optimized for by evolution is
what
what's the one thing a human be
reproduction right we're only optimized
for reproduction
we're basically reproducers
and it's the only thing Evolution cares
about it only cares about making more of
you nothing else
just survival and making more
now
if you take your most Basic Instinct
which is your reproductive Instinct and
you click it off
because your body knows it can't make a
baby
how does that not affect your mentality
how could that not make you feel like
you're not an actual human being in the
world
your most basic biological drive and
they turn it off
there's no way that's good for you
is it
now again I have no medical data to back
it it's not based on my Advanced Medical
degrees I don't have
there's no science to it
I'm just saying isn't it obvious
am I wrong about that to me that's so
obvious
that I wouldn't even need to study it if
you turn off your most Basic Instinct
what's left because you know you never
evolved
humans did not evolve to be happy
outside of their primary drive
that's why I tell people if they're
trying to be happy make sure you're
connected to the reproductive process
even if only symbolically
because at least your body and brain
will you know be connected symbolically
and that might be enough to trigger some
Happiness by symbolically I mean take my
example
so being a stepfather
connects me to the whole you know
bringing up children and stuff without
actually being a biological parent
so there are other things you can do
dating you know just being dating trying
to get married trying to have a kid you
know any of those things that are
contributing to the reproductive process
probably makes you happy
you know all other things being okay
that's probably what makes you happy
all right
um
so the walls are closing in so Comer
representative Comer says he's got
evidence of the Biden family receiving
money in exchange for policy decisions
and on Wednesday we're going to hear
that evidence
is anybody uh prepared to be
disappointed by the quality of that
evidence
does anybody think the walls are closing
in on Biden
we have one Optimist in the group
I I don't think that optimism is called
for
I will certainly pay attention I will
listen to that story
let me guess what it's going to look
like
we found a thing
which we don't fully understand could be
explained by more than one thing
but one of those things that would
explain it was that he sold something
for a policy decision
I feel like there'll be more than one
explanation for what we see
yeah there'll be some plausible
deniability right
so it might convince us as voters it
might convince us that there's something
there but I don't I don't think the
legal system is going to move on it
yeah we'll see
um I guess Biden has banned the New York
Post from some press events upcoming
because they were the the big hunter
laptop story people
I don't know if that's true maybe they
had some other reason but
it's disturbing
um
are you wondering how hard it is to move
our manufacturing from China well here's
an update uh India is going hard at
trying to become the the extra place to
manufacture but in case you didn't know
here are the other countries that are
trying to be that
you know China replacement for
manufacturing so India is number one
they're going the hardest it looks like
and having the best success but also in
Mexico
uh Vietnam and Malaysia
so keep an eye on those three countries
and the fact that Mexico is one of them
I I don't know how much effort the
United States is putting into
helping Mexico become a non-corrupt
place to do business
but I feel like it's the corruption
that's the only thing keeping Mexico
from being the dominant manufacturing
Hub am I wrong about that
well doesn't Mexico have everything
I mean it's proximity to the United
States alone
is gigantic it seems like Mexico has
everything or could easily have
everything so it's got to be the
corruption
that keeps it from being you know the
place for North America to move its
businesses
yeah it's got to be the narcos State
you're right
uh remember the other day the Wagner
group had pregosian was argued was
complaining in public which was weird
that Moscow was letting him down and the
the regular military wasn't giving him
weapons and he was going to withdraw and
stop fighting because they weren't
giving him not weapons but enough
ammunition and then the Russian military
said yes we will give you enough
ammunition and then progression back
down and he decided that he would not he
would not pull out because they promised
to give him ammunition
now what do you think happened next
[Laughter]
do you think pagosian got a whole bunch
of ammunition
do you think that the Russians who
promised him more ammunition loaded it
up on trucks and sent it off to them
no they just lied
that was it they just said oh absolutely
we'll give you ammunition we'll give you
all the ammunition you like we'll we'll
send you more ammunition than you can
even shoot
and then they just didn't
so everything that you worry about
Russia you know lying to the United
States or to Nato or anybody else
they're lying to each other just as much
so Russia has an enormous lying problem
you know maybe even worse than ours at
which they can't get anything done
internally because they're all just
lying to each other oh absolutely
I'll have that done tomorrow don't mean
any of it
so progressions mad again about not
getting his ammo but he's not at the
moment saying he's going to leave so
maybe he's still hoping
uh I thought this was funny Russia had
its uh annual Victory Day which is a
military
kind of parade and they scaled it back I
saw one headline that said they had one
tank
I didn't even read the story because
when I saw the headline that said they
scaled it back to one tank
I didn't want to read it and find out
that wasn't true
because I'm pretty sure that if I read
down there would be lots of other assets
there so so maybe the the one tank thing
the headline was misleading but I like
the misleading headline so much I didn't
want to know that it wasn't true it's
like yeah just one tank
Victory Day one tank
even if it's not true but to me the
Victory Day thing as progosian was
criticizing it as well
it was a really bad look
if you're if you're Putin
and your military says they don't have
enough ammo and they're going to lose
the war
and you're having a Victory Day
celebration
it's just a bad look
and then making your Victory Day
celebration more pathetic by having
fewer military Assets in it
makes you look like you're running out
of
like there wasn't anything Putin could
do there wasn't going to be a big
mistake on Victory day except canceling
it and he didn't do that
I guess canceling it would look bad too
all right
um here's a story I'm trying to keep you
up to date on
um I was pretty sure this was going to
happen but now it's happening you've
heard of this job called prompt engineer
for AI so if you have to ask the
question in just the right way and
sometimes you have to put a whole page
of prompts
to get a good answer what that means is
regular people will only be able to use
AI
for basically ordinary search stuff you
have pretty basic stuff but for anything
really useful
such as having it write code for you
that sort of thing you're going to need
somebody who's not only trained to know
that the code is is right
so you need a programmer
but you also need somebody who knows
psychology and Ai and is also good with
words
so it's this whole new skill to be a
prompt engineer so prompt engineer is
basically a programmer
they are programmers it's just that
instead of calling in a program they
call it a prompt The Prompt being a
bunch of English words and English
sentences
but it's code
it's the code that you have to know to
write on the fly so the AI will give you
a useful answer instead of a surface e
not useful answer
right so if you thought that AI would
make programmers obsolete it looks like
it's going to be the opposite it looks
like programmers will just use AI as one
of their tools but that AI isn't going
to make programs on its own and you and
I won't know how to tell it to do it
let me give you the current example all
right so years ago I was a programmer so
I've written a lot of programs
and so I understand yeah I understand
the basics even though I haven't been
involved in a long time
I wouldn't know how to write code with
AI
and as a casual user who doesn't work as
a programmer at the moment I would know
more than 85 percent of the Normal
public about how things work you know
just because I was once in that world
and I don't know how to do it
which AI would I use for that and then
if AI wrote me a code what would I do
with it
where do I put it how do I compile it
how do I get it into the Apple Store
I I feel like all these stories we're
seeing in in the Press
are all like a demonstration of a new
product
do you ever go to a technology demo you
know in in your corporate lives and
somebody will demonstrate the technology
and you'll say wow you know when can I
buy that well
you know we don't have one with these
features but you just showed me these
features well this is more of a
prototype but it works right well
working is working is sort of hard to
Define it is using a temporary database
than the real world doesn't exist but
it's more to show you what it could do
but it doesn't actually do that like I I
couldn't do that right if I own that no
you couldn't do that it's just a
demonstration of what maybe it could do
in the future so I'm feeling like all
these AI demonstrations
people will say look what I did I had it
write this code to do this and I'll be
like wow AI wrote you a whole bunch of
computer code that works I didn't like
it in a second impressive
but what would I do with that
so now I've got a page of code
what now
okay here's the code for my app
and now
I cut and paste it
right so there there's this a hundred
miles of technical knowledge
that you would have to have to make use
of ai's ability to write code
you're not going to get rid of
programmers you're going to need them to
use AI to do anything
because regular people won't be able to
do anything
at least in terms of writing apps and
stuff
AI can teach you all of this not yet
not right
now I don't I don't disagree that it
might happen but I can't see AI creating
Flawless apps that don't require a
programmer to debug them
or optimize them I just don't see it
happening
all right
um
to serve man is a cookbook
there's always got to be an NPC in here
somewhere
all right that ladies and gentlemen
concludes one of the most powerful and
informational perhaps entertaining live
streams of your entire lives
maybe the best thing you've ever seen in
your life possibly
so I'm going to say goodbye to the
YouTube folks thanks for joining
powerful and useful
and uh I might be doing a man cave
tonight for subscribers if you like to
get a little extra
by the way what what the uh let me just
tell the YouTube people a little bit
about this because I think it's so I
started doing a separate live stream
some evenings from my garage slash man
cave
in which we enjoy some legal adult
entertainment
and chat about anything we feel like it
but here's what's interesting about it
it sort of evolved from a presentation
where I try to have something that I
plan to say
to just hanging out
right I'm looking at the locals people
wouldn't you say because I actually I
turn on the live stream and I don't go
on right away because I'm preparing and
you know a few hundred people will
stream in and they start their own party
so by the time I go live the party's in
full flow and has nothing to do with me
and they start talking and they're just
talking among themselves I could barely
get it a word edgewise but it doesn't
matter
because uh people are
craving human connection
there there's a lack of human Connection
in society you're all aware of it I'm
sure and it's severe
it is severe and this little bit of
digital connection
that I enjoy with the other few hundred
people uh most evenings I'm doing it
more often than not now is really
satisfying
and I have to say
that when I started doing it
you know it would look like it would be
a lot of work if I did it all the time
but now I look just look forward to it
much the way I look forward to doing
this live stream so it turned into this
completely symbiotic
it evolved into
um a few hundred people who
essentially have a similar sense of
humor
uh let me ask this question to the
locals people wouldn't you say that the
single thing that binds the live stream
members together for the man cave is the
same sense of humor
it's kind of that right yeah and that's
kind of a thin connection right
but it's important
because if you can laugh with another
human being you feel connected you know
a good laugh with another person who's
very connecting thing
so we get together at night and you'd
have to be a subscriber to do to see it
and
we just hang out
and I think it's really useful
you know on a an actual mental health
level I feel like it's good for all of
our mental health what would you say
locals would you say is good for your
mental health because I think it's it's
gone beyond entertainment at this point
you know I try to be entertaining but I
don't think that's the benefit I think
the benefit is just the connection that
people are feeling
so maybe we'll see more of that
all right good that's all yeses it's a
big stream of yeses on the locals all
right I just wanted to share that with
you on YouTube and I will talk to you in
the morning
bye for now this will also be on Rumble
later uh rumble's not live though
