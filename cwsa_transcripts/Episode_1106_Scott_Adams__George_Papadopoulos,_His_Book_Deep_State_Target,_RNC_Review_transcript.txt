technology
george are you there
lined up you were you you
are audio only so they can only hear you
but they can see me
okay oh god i got it perfect perfect you
know i accidentally
set up a paris white live feed and i was
sitting on a couch staring into the
abyss
so all right well
we got we got it now um so it sounds
like you might be
you might be a little far away from uh
your microphone
how about you be a little closer can you
hear me oh that's way better
way better all right now george
uh i think most of my audience will
recognize your name immediately
and i'll say what the the book
uh text says when i look for your book
deep state
at target how i got caught in the
crosshairs of the plot to bring down
president trump
um and your advisor to
president trump's presidential campaign
and the first campaign
and you got pulled into something and
you wrote a book about it
and by the way i just looked at the
reviews of your book
oh my god you have good reviews i don't
know
i don't know if i've seen too many books
i have 86
5 star reviews that's crazy i mean i've
written a few books and that's
that's crazy so congratulations on that
thank you thank you
uh so george our big problem is that
we've got people who probably know the
details and some don't can you give us
the
the briefest outline of what happened to
you
and therefore kicked off the book
absolutely and thanks a lot for having
me scott it's
been a pleasure so basically i
had worked in dc for five years uh
leading up to joining both
ben carson's presidential campaign and
then donald trump's present
campaign a lot of people forget that i
actually joined uh ben carson's campaign
first
and at that time uh clearly the deck
was stacked against all the republican
camps even when i was on ben carson's
campaign there were
clear animus by the obama administration
state department officials
you name it they were all either looking
to what these candidates were up to who
their teams were
or find ways to basically infiltrate
their campaigns and we saw that
happen uh with donald trump's campaign
more vivid
than any other campaign and as soon as i
joined uh
donald trump's campaign that's exactly
when it seems the world's intelligence
community collapsed on my
lap while i was living in europe for the
first month i was on the campaign and
they were targeting myself
general flynn carter page others and it
just really
asserted efforts by not only the obama
administration but i also argue in my
book
of foreign governments who had vested
interests
in a clinton presidency that wanted to
the trump campaign and to assure that if
he did end up getting elected that he
would be handcuffed
and that's exactly what we've lived
through as a country the last two years
now to tell us without without all the
details because it's kind of hard to
compress it all
what was the first sketchy contact with
another person that you had
which was clearly some kind of an
intelligence or
uh or something that was just
sketchy who was the first person who
contacted you
before the post even knew that i had
publicly joined the trump campaign a
very shady operative who
is now at the center of probably three
different investigations
made contact with me in in italy
so this happened in early march and then
if uh who's ever read my book or who
knows the story somewhat
we'll see that individual who then
introduces me to the fake niece of
vladimir putin
uh he begins to try and uh infiltrate
the campaign through me he eventually
tells me
that hillary's emails and now he's gone
underground
for the last couple of years and he's at
the center of the durham investigation
now what is his nationality this is
maltese
individual i believe he's a dual italian
maltese native who had very
few if any ties to russia
overwhelmingly tied to the u.s
government to the british government and
other nato governments in um
now early on the first time he contacted
you
did you not sort of google him and say
there's there might be something a
little fishy going on here
at what point did you realize there was
something not right about him
well actually the way that i was reeled
in was
exactly because he wasn't uh overtly
fishy initially
when you google this guy initially
you'll see that he was a professor
he was connected to the state department
to the to various governments in europe
and he had really no connections
whatsoever to any hostile power so when
i first met him that's how i
actually was reeled in to meet him and
shortly thereafter that's when uh
his motives seem to be a far more
sketchy
so would you say that it is a fact that
the obama
administration quote spied on the
campaign
or would you say that that requires some
nuance
we we have to remember that there's an
active criminal investigation looking
into the so-called spying
the durham probe evolved into a criminal
matter
once information about this individual
joseph mifsud
was relayed to bar's office by the
italian government
now we also have evidence that various
spies were sent to meet
with general myself others on the
campaign
and stefan halper who is one of these
spies actually tried to
ingratiate himself within the transition
team
so clearly there was fine going on
against the campaign
the question now is not if there was
fine but was it illegal
and we've already seen a guilty plea on
the other side
and is there anything that you know that
were connected to
obama or biden personally or or do you
just know
in terms of that connection what you've
seen in the news like the rest of us
what i what i know is that the type of
foreign governments and foreign
officials that were involved in my story
from governments like italy
these governments are not acting alone
and they're not
working to set up americans abroad
working for presidential campaigns it
just doesn't happen
clearly directed to do it by the us
government the question is how high up
did it go
we know with the recent unmasking of
general flynn that vice president joe
biden was directly involved in the
unmasking of him
which which was an illegal act was biden
and obama involved in unmasking other
people possibly trump himself
that's something that attorney general
bahrain will and john durham still have
not exposed
that's something that i think we will be
seeing moving forward
if you had to guess how this is going to
end up when durham is done
what do you think is the outcome that we
should expect
let's say let me let me ask you
differently
if durham really got the goods so that
there was no doubt about what happened
what would be the outcome the outcome
and i've said this
for a long time now is that i think
durham is looking into a conspiracy case
a potential ricoh case
that involves a conspiracy
to not only fabricate evidence and
scenarios around trump campaign
associates
but to then utilize that fake evidence
to
finally spy on the campaign we now know
that the fbi
lied to the fisa court in order to
obtain those warrants against carter
page and others
and moving forward we're also going to
if
uh treason was committed as the
president himself calls it because
subverting democracy and interfering in
the democratic process in this country
is treason
and if anyone was at the highest level
in it they will be held accountable
and that's something i predict now how
do how do you how do you rule out the
other hypothesis
which is that the uh the folks who did
all this
had a genuine concern about russia and
they couldn't really know if there was
anything there until they dug into it
so that that would be their claim how do
you know their intentions
versus what they did because what they
did could be spun either way wouldn't
you say
this that's a good that's a great
question and and i and i would agree
you if there were true suspicious links
between the campaign and a foreign
hostile power but in the case
especially in my case and which at the
center of the durham
probe they're looking to see if this was
fabricated
if the entire story known as russiagate
was a
fake manifestation that you would find a
hollywood screenwriter coming up with
and that's why
this joseph mifsud who was at the center
of the
of the mueller report the horowitz
report uh where they were calling him
and dangling the russian emails to me as
i mentioned earlier
if he was really working with the cia
and other
friendly governments now if that is a
support
yeah now but suppose
i'm just speculating here imagining what
the defense or the explanation would be
on the other side
suppose they said we had real concerns
about trump and russia
because we we heard he had investments
and therefore if there's a money link
that's a real concern but we didn't know
how to get at that
so we went through a side door by sort
of creating a situation
but really it was to find out if there
really was something
because we suspect it was we just
couldn't get at it directly
now i don't know if that would be legal
or illegal but suppose they said that
how could you disprove that intention
because that's sort of a mental state
well we've seen actual consequences of
their attempt to circumvent the law and
to do
what i believe is a legal action where
you had this
fbi lawyer kevin kline essentially right
that's
carter page is not a cia asset he's
working with the russians so let's spy
on him and by extension
target the rest of the campaign we saw
will it
yeah but let's accept
that let's say they they confess yeah we
we fudged some things we we lied on the
investigative stuff
but our intention was just to get us
something that we thought was real
yeah we broke some rules we custom
corners but our intention was to find
something real we just went through this
weird side door that we really shouldn't
have
what if they say that well the the
beauty of our country is that we have a
constitution and the rule of law and you
require
you also require a an adequate predicate
to launch either a counter intelligence
or criminal investigation into an
american citizen
that citizens are protected by the
constitution and the bill of rights
and this is something so but george but
but george that
so that part we could prove we could we
could prove that they did or did not
break those laws and i think
it'll be easy to prove that they did
break those laws and that
that can't be overlooked but how do you
improve the
their intention because that it all
really it all boils down to what they
were thinking when they did it right
well it does and that's why uh we're now
only recently unearthing declassified
doc
people like senator lindsey graham who
have showcased
that people like bill priesthip this
high-level
fbi attorney lied under oath where he
said idea about the sub-source of steel
and that we verified everything
and uh this information that we had no
idea even existed
that even the senate didn't know existed
is only now worth
and it's essentially exposing their
corruption and possible
illegal action and that's exactly why
richard grinnell did such a duty to the
american public by
so much of this and what uh the director
of national intelligence
currently uh radcliffe is doing as well
so so so the the logic then is that with
so much cover up the fact that we know
we know there was cover-ups we know
there was
bad behavior to to get this going that
there's so much of it and so many people
were involved that
it's just hard to write it off as people
with good intentions
is that is that basically there's just
too much
too much evidence to assume that they're
all working with good intentions it
would be
sort of unlikely is that is that where
we're at and that's exactly
what i what i think and i think you're
absolutely correct here i i think they
try
to pass uh accountability and
any wrongdoing simply to kevin klein's
memphis fbi attorney
but shortly after his guilty plea like i
mentioned lindsey graham
went public and stated that he's
bringing in other fbi officials now that
they've learned new information that
they did not know
that clearly demonstrates that they lied
under oath and that this could not
simply have been a coincidence
looks like a concerted effort to
undermine a rival presidential campaign
and that's what
is at the heart of this new
investigation
all right and what uh in your book that
i said
has amazing reviews i mean i'm really
impressed if you look at
you know i i read a number of the five
star reviews and they're quite
blown away by your book so
congratulations on that so it's called
deep state target and if you want to
link to it
i tweeted it out so look at the top of
my twitter feed today
if you want to get a copy of that what
would be in your book
that you think would be one thing that
the general public
unless they were really really looking
into it but just the general public
who's following the story
what is it that they don't know that is
there is there a fact that you know
that may or may not be in the book that
that would just blow people's mind
they just sort of don't know it
argue and i and i think i lay it out
very strategically from a to z in my
book
that the old narrative was that the
trump campaign was colluding to win
argue and i lay out with facts and i
think daily and monthly
those facts are now being corroborated
by new declassified information
is that not only did the trump campaign
not collude with any foreign governments
or with the u.s government for that
matter but the obama administration
colluded
not only with the clinton campaign but
with foreign governments to
the trump campaign and that's exactly
why it's so
difficult for people to understand what
happened because
i'm showcasing a different
which is based in reality and which is
being based on facts being declassified
yet for three years the mainstream media
kept people
uh essentially uh and uh unable to
understand the reality of the situation
and that's why so it's it's almost like
a
a shock in awe effect when people really
start to find out what
really happened and i and i don't blame
them
and i'm still shocked so so george from
the
first moment i started hearing the story
and christopher steele and x
you know and x spook i said to myself
there's no such thing as an
ex-spy that's not a real thing
there's nobody who's an ex-spy because
they always know
your name they know who you are they
they know you got some connections
and favors you're never really an ex-spy
and and i thought well when is the press
going to tell me that
great britain is highly culpable in this
whole thing
and i kept waiting and they kept
presenting evidence
that great britain was involved but they
never said it
and i kept saying well why why don't you
say what's obvious
that great britain had to be involved in
this would am i wrong was great britain
involved in this in terms of
intelligence why is helping the united
states or is that not a fact
scott you're you're absolutely correct
and in my book
what i do is because remember i was
basing the first month i was on the
trump campaign
and what was the number one issue that
the uk was dealing with at that time
that the pres that the candidate
was very uh supportive of and that was
brexit the
establishment at that time clearly had a
motivation to find out
what trump and his team were up to
considering how outspoken
trump was for brexit to this day you see
how sensitive the issue is in the uk
and the president and i should say the
candidate when he would speak about
brexit
and i would meet with uk officials they
were extremely hostile
i was speaking to iran at that point
about how dangerous
the candidate was to british interests
around
the world and that's why i'm not
surprised surprised that
christopher steele was british alexander
downer was connected to mi6
stefan helper was connected to mi6
richard dear love was connected to mr6
and that's another example of it can't
be a coincidence
as you mentioned earlier and well now
but doesn't
wasn't there uh correct me on this
wasn't there some interest or
great britain certainly been it would
have been concerned
that trump was going to be too friendly
to russia
which would be a gigantic security
concern for anybody in the you know the
vicinity of europe so do you think that
was part of it
just they didn't want a president who
they thought perhaps mistakenly
would be a little too friendly to russia
if that's the case and i don't know i
can't
and i only speak about facts and then
when i would speak with the uk
government at that time they were very
concerned with brexit more so than
regarding russia now if that was indeed
the case they
probably forgot something over the last
100 years
actually 200 years of american history
and that's at the present
foreign policy in this country not his
not the diplomats
not the bureaucrats not the unelected
but the president
and they would have seen a predict
individual
who from day one going as far back as
2015
stated that having a working
relationship with russia and a more
i guess confrontational relationship is
in the us
interest and that's exactly what's been
playing out for the last couple years
and it's actually
safeguarding u.s interests throughout
the world
all right all right so this this is
fascinating i'm going to get on to
some other topics here george but uh
thank you
so much for uh joining if anybody's
joining uh late
check out george papadopoulos's book
deep state
target how i got caught in the
crosshairs of the plot to bring down
president trump as i said
the reviews for this book are just off
the chart so
it sounds like you should get a read get
it get that and take a good read
thanks george thanks for joining me
thank you scott appreciate it
take care all right that was excellent
let's talk about some other stuff
all right um i've decided to
uh to join with the professional
athletes so the professional athletes as
you know
at the nba walked out and then some
other sports
also walked out in solidarity and
they're walking out in protest
about social injustice and i've decided
to support them
not by walking out of course but but i
support their walk
out and indeed i don't support them
going back to work
until systemic racism is solved
so you might say to yourself hey
isn't a boycott or a strike one of those
things that you do
because you've got something specific
you want to accomplish
but and it's short-term i guess it
doesn't have to be
so the athletes have walked out and if
they go back to work
before systemic racism in this country
is
fixed i don't know what to think i don't
know what to think
apparently they don't care about
anything
all right we still don't have an answer
from the white house about why
saliva test drips are not
okayed by the fda i know there's some
requirement
that eased the restriction on reporting
which was one of the hang-ups but i
think that got blown away
so the i think i think the fda has now
said
the reporting is optional for some of
these types of tests
but i told you more than a week ago
that given that these saliva test strips
the kinds that would you
just do at home you don't need any kind
of healthcare professional
there's nothing that goes up your nose
because of saliva
you don't need a device this be like a
pregnancy test
now apparently these are easy to make or
easy enough
but and the math of it is even though
they're not as
sensitive as they like to say you could
you could test so rapidly and so often
that even with a less perfect test
you would end up having a much better
result because it would be frequent
and it would catch people eventually and
soon enough
so given that this is the primary thing
that could
that seems practical that could
stop the coronavirus in its tracks and
the
the white house has not and the fda have
not answered
the public and i'm just talking about
giving us an answer
either yes it's a good idea and we're
working on it
that'd be a good answer or no it's a bad
idea
and here are reasons that you didn't
know about which
could be acceptable but not
answering it um screams corruption
possibly impeachable did that sound too
strong
if it did let me say it again not
getting
at least an answer to the public and to
the press
about why these are either in the
process and we'll get these
approved pretty soon or why it's not in
the process and there's a good reason
without any answer either of those sides
it has to be
either corruption or something
impeachable doesn't have to be illegal
so um i think the trump administration
needs to
respond to that and again there are only
two possibilities
it's corruption or if it's being ignored
for some
other reason since they obviously know
about it it's got to be impeachable
whatever that reason is because the
public
has a very very clear
right to know what's going on there does
that sound too strong
because i mean it somebody says bye
now if they if they don't at least tell
us it's either corruption
or it's an impeachable something i don't
know i don't know what else it would be
because all they'd have to do is say
we're working on it we'll get back to
you and that'll be fine
you know i don't i don't need a specific
answer i need to know that they're
willing to answer
that's completely different yeah
impeachable because
it's such an obvious path
that if they don't at least tell us why
they're not taking it
we cannot assume that they're doing
their job on the single biggest
priority of the country all right so
that's the downer part of this
let's get to something else the
production i just i just lost about a
thousand viewers by saying that
that's for those of you who wonder if i
ever criticized the trump administration
so you can refer to that when you wonder
the tv production was amazing
so there was no competition between what
the rnc
and the dnc said now let me ask you this
you're trying to pick a president based
on competence
right you know does he hire the right
people
can they get the job done what do we
have to
compare biden and trump we have biden
who's never run a successful
presidential campaign
right being a senator is kind of easy
if i'm being honest because they don't
have to manage anything
except whatever their little staff and
the staff probably manages them as much
as the other way around
so biden has several has shown us
several examples of his ability to get
something
done in a management leader
way uh each of his prior campaigns which
were failures
like really big failures and then we
have his current campaign
which i think even even the people on
the democratic
side would would acknowledge it's done
very poorly
nobody would disagree with that right
but somebody's mentioning the five
dollar tests that were just approved
completely different those have to be
administered by healthcare professional
and it's a nasal swab so if it has to be
a healthcare professional that has
nothing to do with the the saliva test
strips which individuals would use
completely different application which
would solve coronavirus
versus the one that was approved which
is real good
but it doesn't come anywhere near
solving anything it's not it's not meant
for that
um because the volume wouldn't be there
all right so uh sorry i got interrupted
but i saw your
your comments there i wanted to address
that so the production was
great and if you compare that to
biden he ran one of the worst
conventions of all time no not one of it
was the worst
isn't that fair to say that the worst
convention
execution was the biden campaign
so now he's got three or four
failed presidential campaigns his only
leadership
management jobs that he's ever done that
we know of
then there's this campaign which he's
failing right in front of us
nobody would even doubt that i don't
think
and um
and now we see him organize his is the
you know even though he's not personally
organizing the democratic
uh convention he's still sort of the
the guy so if you look at what the
democrats can do collectively it was a
complete failure
now compare this to trump's performance
trump ran for president a few times but
really just dipped his feet in
you know but when he ran this last time
i think everybody would say it was a
great job great campaign
more effective strategically went to the
right states
did all the right things had the right
energy gave the best speeches had the
best crowds
and now you're watching the rnc that
both sides 100 agree
that the rnc just absolutely smoked
smoked the dnc in terms of production
quality
now once you've watched all of these
manager-ish leadership
organizational things and you've seen
that biden has only failed
that's all he's done there is no success
that is biden managing and leading he's
been involved with legislation
he's been a gopher for obama but he
hasn't really managed anything big
trump has he's managed very big things
and successfully
so that contrast is enormous so you got
that going on
here are some surprises from last night
what are the odds and this one this just
blew me away
so alice johnson who is is pardoned the
right word she was
released early on that first step thing
i think i forget the details but she
so trump got her out of jail before her
term was over whatever term he used for
that
and uh what were the odds
that alice johnson was
also an incredibly good public speaker
did anybody see that coming that was one
of the coolest things
that i don't know if it's going to get
much you know much
action but just the fact that
she was rotting in prison you know
no good to anybody well actually that's
that's wrong i guess she was very
productive
in prison with other prisoners which is
part of what got around
early so apparently she's a really good
person
but she's a great public speaker i mean
that was
really good that's hard to do if you
don't know how hard that is
to do what alice jones did you might not
quite
appreciate how good she was i don't
think she has practice
she so i don't know where she's going in
life
but i'd watch her she's got some game
david dorn's widow great on camera no
obviously they probably tested everybody
to make sure that they'd do okay and
they
recorded things so they could do it more
than once i suppose
but she was amazing on camera um
and then the president gave his what was
called too long
by both sides his uh his speech
here's the thing why was it too long
70 minutes now most now most experts
will say no you don't want to do a 70
minute
speech somebody said uh i forget who
that 13 minutes maybe you humor somebody
13 minutes is how long people can pay
attention
if it's nothing but you talking but i
don't think that applies to trump
i watched all 70 minutes didn't you
i watched all 70 minutes and
i couldn't pull my i couldn't pull
myself away
now i would agree that he seemed a
little lower energy than he normally is
and i think that's because they made him
you know or he agreed to read off the
teleprompter
he is not that excited with a smallish
crowd reading off a teleprompter that's
the two things you don't want to give
trump
a small crowd and a teleprompter
that's that's not his ideal condition
his ideal condition
gigantic live crowd no teleprompter
you know you know doing walking the the
wire without the
without the the help so
uh he was a little low energy but
does it the reason that was long is
because he had so many accomplishments
and he had so many legitimate complaints
about biden
he could have done a much shorter speech
if he had no accomplishments
but it took a long time to list all the
stuff he's done
a long time now i don't see how this
election could possibly be close
because biden is decomposing before our
eyes
trump's list of accomplishments which
we'll talk about how true or not true
they are
but it's a long list his list of
accomplishments
is very long and as somebody said in the
comments it does demonstrate
that he can stand and talk for 70
minutes late at night
and that's pretty good
all right um you know that the
the republicans nailed it in their
convention because i immediately turned
to
cnn to see their response and they were
in
full tds frenzy i mean they were angry
but the things that they had to complain
about were so few
that they had to be really angry about
really small stuff
so they ended up complaining about them
using the lawn of the white house and
the hatch act
literally nobody in the country cares
let me speak for
a hundred percent of the voters in this
country
what's the hatch act it's what
the president can't do what presidents
do which is campaign for reelection
in the white house i can sort of see why
that might be a law but
i don't care about it i wouldn't care if
obama did it
i wouldn't care if the next president
does it i couldn't care less
and by the way have you heard of the
coronavirus
you know it's a pretty good excuse to to
work from home it's the coronavirus
now uh of course the uh the participants
were mostly not wearing masks
and that became cnn story and i almost
wondered if that was intentional because
every time the president or the campaign
forces his opponents to talk about the
smallest
stuff they're not talking about anything
important that can hurt him
if all they're talking about is hey
those people didn't wear masks
and then rand paul and the others walk
outside
and they're immediately greeted by large
groups
of of people who are now socially
distancing and are all democrats
at least democrat friendly so
it first of all brings up the you know
the hypocrisy thing because
obviously there have been protests etc
without social distancing
but it does force them to talk about the
things that the citizens
care the least about yet it's true
that as the leader of the country
wouldn't it have been a better message
to show them without masks
or not to show them wearing masks as
modeling good behavior
i can see that i would say that's not an
illegitimate
criticism it's just not very big
so it could be true it's a true
criticism
but it's sort of a small one and here's
the funniest part
the president i think is playing this
strategically brilliantly so far
we don't know if they're going to be
able to maintain this but
the discipline it takes for trump
not to be too provocative during the
convention
think about it i don't think trump did
anything during the
entire convention that made that made
the critics go crazy
he played it straight and i don't think
they like it
because they need him to do some crazy
stuff you know tweet something
provocative
somebody so we can really dig in and
call him a racist or whatever we're
going to call him
and he just keeps telling us his
accomplishments
and that must be driving them crazy
because the accomplishments even though
they try to debunk them with
the fact checkers and stuff there's
still so many of them that the laundry
list
persuasion comes into play you know i
always talk about it when it gets used
against you
it's devastating because it's a whole
bunch of things you don't believe
individually but damn there's so many of
them must be something in that list
that's true
so the president likewise has a really
long list of accomplishments
if he tried to pick off a few and say
hey wait a minute
that one's not true or that one's not
quite the way you said it
people go well yeah but look at all this
other stuff
i mean that's you know suppose you're
right suppose that one isn't quite what
he says
look at all this other stuff so this the
the laundry list
persuasion is effective
even if you think it shouldn't be so uh
so they got that going on so the fact
that the president has shown
this much restraint even to the point
where they thought
is his his uh presentation was flat
it's pretty pretty uh good strategy
let's see if he can hold that
because by the way all he would have to
do and i say it like it's easy but it's
not
all he'd have to do is not intentionally
cause trouble between now and election
i don't see how he could lose because
he's gonna have to do
something wrong to lose this thing and
it's going to have to happen between now
and election day
if he doesn't do something that's an
unforced error between now and then
i just don't see how he loses it just
looks impossible
from today's perspective all right
so watching the uh cnn go crazy uh and
they were really worked up
it was funny to watch how agitated they
were like literally funny
i watch it as humor um
so here are the kinds of fact checking
that they do
on trump's speech so they had their
daniel dale
fact check come on he was he was all
worked up and he said that this is the
lyingest president ever he's a serial
liar and he had
over 20 lies in his speech but
listen to the things they call lies
and compare them i will in a moment to
joe biden's lies
and see if you can see if there's a
difference
for example they fact
check fact checked trump on his claims
of how many miles of the wall
he's built and they say hey you can't
count all that as
new all because that is wall that's
going in to replace
inadequate wall that was going to be
fixed anyway
now is it a lie when the president says
i have x hundreds of miles of wall
if it's also true that there was some
kind of barrier there before
could have been small fence or wire but
it wasn't working
is there a reason that you replace a
wall
i think you replace a wall because it's
not working
would they be replacing things that were
fine
so i would say it's quite a big
accomplishment
if you've replaced walls and little
fences and
minor barriers with something that
people can't get over
because why were those minor barriers
where they were and there are no minor
barriers in other places well it's
obvious because that was the critical
place
there are some places that most of your
volume is going to happen
and they plug those places with good
wall
good enough wall now is that
a lie well cnn says it's a lie
i believe that a reasonable person could
say yes
it's a lie by omission but does it
matter here's where i'm going with this
how is your life changed by the fact
that
he's improving wall that wasn't doing
the job versus
building brand new wall which would be
the wrong thing to do
because first you want to improve the
wall because that's where the traffic is
it wouldn't make sense to claim credit
for building new all
if you hadn't fixed the old wall first
so yeah i can see technically
that it's an over claim i mean not even
technically it's just a flat out
over claim because there's some context
left out
but does it bother you do you make less
money is the country less safe
let me give you another one trump
claimed credit for some kind of
veterans administration thing that he
did and the fact checker says no no no
obama got that going and what trump did
was some
minor revision that happened later
okay sounds like a little hyperbole
maybe a bit of an
over claim but how did that affect you
do were you less safe were did you make
less money
did somebody hate you were you hurt
nothing let me give you another one
so trump claims that obama
the administration spied on his campaign
that is fact-checked as false because
cnn says no no you don't use that word
spied
it was more like they had a reason to do
some uh
intelligence george papadopoulos i think
put some holes in that
but cnn's claim is really that the
word isn't quite right and maybe the
full intention hasn't been proven
but does that affect you
because whatever it is you thought about
that story
you still think today didn't change
anything did it
so trump's lies as they call him
as they call them or not fact not
passing the fact-checking
they all seem to have that quality that
they don't kind of matter
they just paint a picture that he's
doing his job
now let's compare that to joe biden's
lies
let's see if joe biden's lies are those
harmless kind
all right so joe biden has claimed
famously
that president trump called white
supremacists
fine people in charlottesville now
suppose
that the country believes that or some
portion of the country
is that harmless that is not harmless
that is the sort of thing that rips the
country apart
it causes protests in the street it
causes things that shouldn't trigger
riots to trigger riots
because it becomes the gasoline just
waiting for a match
maybe the match is these police actions
that turn out tragically for
for black people who got stopped by
police that might be the trigger
but the gasoline is this joe biden kind
of a lie
that the president is literally which he
didn't
praising white supremacists you can't
compare that to exaggerating about how
much
wall you got built and leaving out some
context
those two things are not the same one is
destroying the whole
freaking country ripping apart
everything good about this country and
the other one is just a salesman talking
about his product being good
that's it those are not the same
um am i on shaky ground saying that
that biden is lying well let me give you
a little preview of something that
you're going to see
you're going to see in about
you'll see in about an hour and 15
minutes
or maybe maybe you'll see anyway you'll
see a little later this morning
so i got a little preview from the
rasmussen reports and they did a survey
to see how many people believe the fine
people hoax
how much do you love this so far there's
an actual survey
by rasmussen reports you'll see you'll
see the official one in an hour so
i gotta i get a little preview and uh
apparently 73 percent of republicans
recall what trump actually said which is
when he disavowed the white supremacists
so they recall that he actually
disavowed them which is what he actually
said
but 59 percent of democrats remember it
the way biden does
in other words if you want to know
what is the limit of brainwashing you
just found it
because the perfect test is if
you hold up you i'll do an exaggerated
example if i hold up this pen
and say am i holding a pen
if everybody says um yeah we're looking
right at it you're holding a pen
there's no brainwashing but what if i
could hold up a pen
just as clear as this and say
there's no pen here and i repeated it
enough
and i controlled the entire media cycle
until
60 of the public couldn't see the pen
anymore right it's right here
and sixty percent of the public
couldn't see it is that possible
it just happened the rasmussen poll
found out that democrats who presumably
are mostly in some kind of a
silo of news that 59 of them
i'm gonna round that to 60 percent uh
believe something happened
even though they can look right at it
and they know it didn't
they can look right at it because you
can look at the transcript
it's just written right there but
they've all seen for the most part
they've seen the
the hoax version that lops off the
clarification
by the way if you speak a lot in public
as i do you know i do like an hour a day
without much planning
you very often will say something and
then you start talking about something
else
and you'll realize that that thing you
said a little while ago
needed some clarification because the
way you said it
could have been misinterpreted so you
double back you go okay just to be clear
when i was talking about x this is what
i meant
and this is what i did not mean just so
you're all clear in that most common
thing in the world
when when you do that though it allows
your enemies to lop
off the clarification and and go with
the thing that even you knew
could have been misconstrued that's what
happened with trump he knew it could be
misconstrued so he doubled back
without anybody asking nobody prompted
him he was just
he was just you know riffing and he
doubles back and says just want to make
sure
it's clear i'm not talking about the
the neo-nazis and the white nationalists
and then they just
lop that off so how many people were
fooled
by that edit 59 of democrats
were fooled by it so if you so if you'd
like to know
what's the limit of brainwashing for
something that can
easily be checked just google it
now it's i say easy but if you google
that you might get more
you'll probably get two of the hoaxes
for every one of the
you know the ones that shows the entire
thing
so it isn't that easy but that gives you
kind of a limit of how
brainwashed a public can be so 73
percent of uh republicans got it right
so even
even a lot of republicans think he
actually said that
what and but here's the kicker
if you want to know how this is going to
play in the election 54
of people not affiliated i i think
they're calling them they don't call
them
independents anymore because people
maybe because people are not that
independent when they actually vote
they tend to be consistent one way or
the other they just call themselves
independent
so i think maybe the new name for that
with rasmussen is not affiliated with
the either political party
so the people who call themselves not
affiliated uh
54 of them accurately know that the
fine p that the fine people thing is a
hoax
50 54 of people not affiliated with the
party
know that joe biden is lying about his
most
central campaign theme and
if they were concerned about trump being
not good with the fact-checking and so
they wanted the one who didn't lie
he's literally the worst liar we've ever
seen
worst not just in terms of quantity
i don't know if he's worse than quantity
maybe maybe trump
beats him on quantity but in terms of
how bad the lie is
really really bad that's like one of the
worst lies you could ever tell
so rasmussen is going to make a lot of
people have tds
because they're going to argue that it's
not
it's not accurate
that the president didn't call these
people
fine people but rasmussen cleverly
shows the text that he did so part of
the poll shows the actual
you know the poll results not the poll
but the poll results
show his actual words so there's no
doubt about rasmussen being right about
that interpretation
all right um 39 percent
of people pulled said they actually
believed uh biden
wow um
so here's a little uh oh and the other
thing that
biden lies about it of course is that
the president
suggested drinking disinfectant for
coronavirus
which did not happen i've described in
detail that he was talking about light
technology it's obvious if you see the
whole quote
but it's not obvious if they lop off the
introduction and the summary where he
clarifies that he was talking about
light
so what did the what did the mainstream
press do they lopped off the
clarification before
that gives it context as light and they
lopped off his last sentences
where he brings it back to light so you
know he was only ever talking about
light
all right so that's how that hoax is
created
and biden still pushes that now is it
dangerous
that the public thinks that the person
leading the coronavirus effort
thought ever thought that drinking
bleach which is what they
you know anderson cooper changes it into
drinking bleach
it's pretty dangerous it's pretty
dangerous to tell the public during a
pandemic
that their leader is actually that
that crazy that's dangerous because you
need the public
to comply when the when there's
something to comply with
all right um here's a little trick for
you that i used at my restaurant years
ago
and i've uh i've reconstituted it
and it's a persuasion trick and it goes
like this if there's somebody who's a
big critic of yours and in my old
restaurant days
i actually got a picketer so there was a
guy who
who picketed my restaurant because he
he got fired for something he didn't
like i forget what it was
and you know he deserved to get fired
but he didn't like it so he picketed it
and for a while it was really bothering
the staff
so i came in and i saw the picketer and
i said who's the mascot
and so as soon as i redefined our lone
picketer as our mascot
it just became funny and then nobody
cared anymore
and then he got bored and went away
after a while so
i've decided that jennifer rubin
is the mascot for fake news she's not
the person who just continually makes up
crazy takes on
trump because i don't know why
it looks like a mental problem but i
can't diagnose it from afar
i could just say what it looks like yeah
but
she she used to bother you right you'd
see a jennifer rubin
a story about trump and you just say
what
what what is wrong with you that you
would interpret it
such a such a bad way so stop thinking
that and just think that whenever you
see her
she's the mascot for the fake news it's
similar to
uh uh who's the uh
carl carl bernstein the worse than
watergate guy
if you only just listen to him
complaining about the president
he's the most annoying person in the
world because he seems so illegitimate
like there's nothing about him that
seems even a little bit credible he's
just a partisan
but as soon as i define him as the worst
than watergate guy
that they take out of the closet when
they need they don't have anything
they bring him out when they don't have
anything if you haven't noticed that
they only they only wheel out carl
bernstein
when there's nothing to complain about
and they just need somebody who will
complain anyway
it's like okay we don't have any any
meat
but carl doesn't need any he'll just say
it's worse than watergate whatever it is
so just think of him that way it's
funnier
if you're not keeping up with this uh
kyle rittenhouse
shooting in kenosha the the latest
videos make it pretty clear
that he's going to get off from any kind
of murder charge
because it's so it's so unambiguously
well i won't say unambiguously
but certainly in a situation where
reasonable doubt
is is the prime thing that you're trying
to prove or disprove
in a reasonable doubt situation all
three of the people that he shot
allegedly were
quite unambiguously attacking him now
maybe
there's some question about did he know
that he was in grievous bodily potential
harm
i would say he was because if any one of
those protesters had
say gotten the advantage on him the
other protesters would have
swarmed in so i think he has just the
most
airtight self-defense defense
there may be other issues about why was
he there with a gun he was 17.
so there may be some you know illegality
in that sense
but there really isn't much chance he's
going to get convicted of murder
based on what we've seen have you
noticed
that uh joe biden has a dementia smile
that he uses to stall for time when he
gets an
unfamiliar question that requires him to
think
watch for it and it goes like this so
you know biden sometimes
has angry biden look get off my lawn
you know hatchet get off my lawn i'm
stealing amy klobuchar's joke
about get off my lawn which was a pretty
good tweet
um so he's got his angry look angry
stern squinty
i'm squinty stern and scaring but then
he also has
his uh he smile too big
and laugh and laugh too hard and it goes
like this
uh joe biden um you know
a big part of the country knows that
you're lying about the
fine people hoax what do you say to that
now that would be a tough question
how does joe answer it for those of you
who are listening on podcast
this won't be nearly as hilarious as for
the people watching it on video
when i give my joe biden smiles
impression
and it looks like this first of all he
only smiles with one side
and then that one side is too big so
it's like
and he gives a smile and then he he'll
laugh come on man
come on man
so look for the over smile it's a total
total tip-off
that the dementia has slowed him down
and he's looking for a stalling
technique and so laughing about the
laughability of the joke
it is so laughable that question
so you'll see a lot of that nancy pelosi
has suggested that maybe it would be a
bad idea for biden to debate
because trump just lies and what would
be the point is debating with somebody
who's just going to get up there and lie
or take all your real estate on stage
and crowd you
what about that now i don't think that
that necessarily means
that joe biden uh has already agreed
privately let's say publicly he says he
wants to debate
but i don't think it means that
privately joe biden has decided he's not
going to debate
because here's the problem joe biden
probably thinks he can
or he's talked himself into thinking
that he can
debate i don't think there's anybody
on the democrat side who actually
believes he can
at least the people who are on the
inside and have good information about
him
i don't think there's anybody who thinks
he can debate
so pelosi by floating the idea that he
shouldn't debate from such a high level
of democrat power
makes you think that maybe it's already
approved but i think she's just
testing the idea i think she wanted to
see what the pundits and the public said
about it but i think it it's also
creating space
so that it wouldn't be some big surprise
if biden later said you know
there's no point in debating with this
big old liar
so i'm just going to cancel i think
she's just softening the room
so and i also think
that somebody doesn't know how to talk
to biden and tell him he can't do this
i think that's a real problem like an
actual problem for the country
i doubt there's anybody who can tell him
that he's not up to it and just be
honest about it
i don't know that they can do it
all right um did you see
biden try to get through an anderson
cooper interview he was doing by
zoom or something like it and it did not
look good
he joe did not look like he was
fully with it he bumbled a little bit he
answered the wrong question and threw in
his charlottesville
hoax for some unrelated question about
somebody else
it didn't look good and i felt as though
anderson cooper
was feeling quite awkward
feeling quite awkward because you don't
really know how to deal with that
speaking of rasmussen they also have a
poll result that says
51 percent of both democrats and
unaffiliated voters agree
that it is important for biden to
address the dementia issue publicly
this view is shared by 81 of republicans
so it's mostly republicans 81 percent
but there's a good little slice of
democrats and independents
who think you know if you add them all
together
38 percent of voters think to think
biden has dementia
so 81 of republicans want it to be
addressed
that just means they're suspicious
but 38 of all voters think biden has
dementia
and and people think that he can win
just the fact that anybody thinks that
he can actually win this thing
is crazy now somebody
smart said to me yeah but you know the
coronavirus performance is going to be
the whole story
and that's all people are going to care
about and you know
trump is not getting a pluses from the
public on that
or at least not from the democrats and
so he's vulnerable
to which i say it's not november yet
do you know how much is going to happen
between now and november
a lot and in all likelihood wherever we
are on the coronavirus we'll be in
better shape
either we'll be right just a few weeks
away from the vaccination
which would look like progress even if
you don't like the vaccination idea
we'll probably have some more
therapeutics
we'll probably have an economy of this
recovering a little bit better
oh here's another one of the things that
cnn calls a lie
from the president they say the
president says we gained x million jobs
you know since april but he forgets
he neglect not forgets but he leaves out
that we lost
22 million well does he need to put that
in there
is there anybody watching the president
claim that we've gained
9 million or whatever it was jobs in the
last
month or so is there anybody who doesn't
understand
without being told that we lost
more than that and we're just you know
making back some of our loss
is there anybody who didn't understand
that so that was fact jack the lie
because he left out the context that
everybody understands
so these are the trivial kinds of things
that cnn says are the president's lies
and then you've got dumbass biden
with his uh race-baiting you know
hoax that will rip the society apart
those are not equal all right
um somebody says did harris
speak yesterday i think she did but she
didn't get much attention
all right
um so
kamala's speech he's completely lying
well if you're looking for the
politician who doesn't lie
good luck good luck
there's still uh still buzz about
hydroxychloroquine
uh between now and november do you know
what's
also is going to happen you can have a
lot more
drug trials for hydroxychloroquine that
have been completed
some of them i don't know if there's
anything going on now but i'm hoping
there's at least
one of those gold standard types of
clinical trials
for hydroxychloroquine i don't know if
there will be
but what if there is what what if
between now and election day
there's a gold standard test for
hydroxychloroquine and it shows it works
or shows it doesn't work it's going to
be a pretty big impact
on the on the minds of voters whichever
way it goes
i do think that president trump's
going hard on china is devastatingly
effective
because biden is obviously framed as
soft on china and i think that's
fair framing i don't think that's
unreasonable and
i that alone is gigantic i mean that
would win the midwest
just by being hard on china and trying
to get the manufacturing back
trump also has a surprisingly good story
on health care
because he's cut enough regulations from
telehealth to
making the most favor most favored
nations that's not cutting a regulation
but
getting drug prices that are no worse
for the united states than anywhere else
these are some pretty big deals
so the rand paul attack i i don't know
that feels
a little bit political in the sense that
he wasn't attacked attacked
as in nobody was trying to hit him
maybe they would have if he had not been
surrounded by police
maybe they would have but i don't think
he was assaulted per se
i think there was just aggressive
protesters now i wouldn't want any
aggressive protesters coming at me like
that
and if i had a gun if i had a gun i
don't know what i'd do
if they surrounded me like that and i
didn't have police protection i'm not
exactly sure how that would go down
but it's definitely something to be
worried about
and somebody pointed out on twitter that
maxine waters
had called for this very behavior of
not letting these public figures be
unharassed in public
so democrats got to own this i think
so dr zelenko somebody says in the
comments
says there's a conspiracy theory to
squelch
the hydroxychloroquine uh
and uh
i i don't know about that we'll see i'm
still at a 30
chance the hydroxychloroquine works and
you know there was some
effort to suppress it um i saw the
question about jim gaffigan i'm going to
give an answer to that only to the
subscribers on locals
because i uh i know jim
and i met him spent some time with him
uh
and uh i'll tell the people on locals
what that was like all right um
and by the way if if you haven't watched
jim gaffigan's
stand-up comedy he's just about one of
the best ones
working today maybe the best could be
the best
working uh comedian
um
rioters are preventing voters from
reaching polls
maybe i don't know
yeah kamal harris gave a pre-bottle
speech and nobody cared
that's probably true oh uh just adding
to the
uh oh i forgot to tell you
uh so i had set a trap by
saying that joe biden's campaign has a
lot of satanic imagery i say
i said before and after and several
times during
that i'm not a believer in other words i
don't believe in satan
i don't believe he exists but there are
a bunch of coincidences
that could be confirmation bias probably
are
that look satanic in terms of the the
campaign and somebody pointed out that
on their logo they've got a pentagram
that's like the satanic pentagram
i thought man when you start looking for
it
when you start looking for it you sure
can find a lot of it
uh which again doesn't mean it's true
however there was a publication
which uh decided to
fact check me and some kind of some kind
of group that tries to fact
check people they think are on the right
and what they did is they lopped off my
uh
part about i'm not a believer so they
did the same editing trick as the fine
people hoax
same one as the drinking disinfectant
same one as the
over feeding the koi fish so it's always
the same trick
if there's a clarifier in there they
just edit that out
so they edited out my clarifier to make
it look as though i was saying with
complete sincerity that joe biden is
running a satanic campaign and this was
of course to make me look crazy
but that wasn't the play
the play was to get attention to that
idea
and if somebody else believes it well
that's on them
i already said i don't believe it so if
they see coincidences and they find it
compelling
well that would be all their own
decision because i do not
tell them to do that because i don't see
it there are just a lot of coincidences
that's just a fact all right that's all
for now and i will talk to you
later
