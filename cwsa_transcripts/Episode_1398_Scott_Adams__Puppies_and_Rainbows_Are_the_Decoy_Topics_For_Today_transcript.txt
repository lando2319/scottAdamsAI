foreign
hey everybody it's time for puppies and
rainbows yeah that's the decoy title for
today we're trying to game the system
with the algorithm because the algorithm
will demonetize me if I have any
controversial topics in it I don't have
any controversial content I mean nothing
that would get me booted off of social
media but it's very controversial in its
own modest way
so uh before we do the simultaneous Sip
and I know that's why many of you here
um can we talk about Floyd Mayweather
and Logan Paul getting ready to box
what is happening with the world
that Floyd Mayweather and Logan Paul
even can be in the same ring
it isn't one of them the best boxer in
the world
and the other one is Logan Paul
it's good entertainment and I have to
say that Logan Paul is a genius at
getting publicity and I also have to say
I was looking at the the video man he's
doing a good job with his Fitness but
you know what the you know what the big
story is
so uh I guess they're doing a little
publicity thing the weigh-in or whatever
it is where the the two potential boxers
are uh you know basically doing a visual
thing
and Logan Paul said and I quote talking
about the uh the the boxing match she
said tomorrow I break the effin
simulation
and beat the greatest boxer in the
history of the planet so even Logan Paul
is describing the fact that he will be
boxing the best boxer on the planet
he says he must be living in a
simulation
what do you think of that
so even Logan Paul is talking about
living in the simulation now if you were
him
and you had the life that Logan Paul has
had so far
wouldn't you believe you lived in a
simulation
because I don't know a ton about Logan
Paul
but it looks like
he just decides what he wants reality to
be and then it becomes that
right well let's let's have the
simultaneous up to that
you know and if you'd like to enjoy it
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
of tanker Charles it's starting to
canteen dragonfly vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dope immediate
of the day the thing makes everything
better
a little oxytocin
sprinkled in it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen now go
ah Ah that's right you made it in time
well the big news uh well before we get
to the big news I love political pranks
especially if they're funny now you saw
the story about uh aoc's grandmother
down in Puerto Rico and the AOC blamed
president Trump for her grandmother
still having a a sub-optimal situation
down there after the disasters in Puerto
Rico
uh so after AOC complained about her
grandmother's situation uh Matt Walsh uh
the daily wire he did a GoFundMe to
raise money for her grandmother so
it's funny because Matt Walsh is a uh
you know right-leaning critic of AOC so
so instead of complaining he just fixes
her problem
now the reason it's hilarious is because
the Republican brand is more about
fixing stuff
and the Democrat brand is more about
complaining about stuff now this may be
just my own impression right but it
feels like that it feels like one is
about fixing stuff and one is about
complaining about stuff so AOC complains
about stuff and Matt Walsh fixes it he
just fixes it except there's a wrinkle
in the plan
which is apparently uh somebody in aoc's
family rejected the money so the
GoFundMe people took it down and took
her money away
so imagine being
imagine being aoc's grandmother
and she's having a bad time and then AOC
who's doing great
is complaining about her grandmother
having a bad time and her grandmother is
probably thinking you know
you could probably fix some of this
I'm just saying
you're a AOC
I'm your grandmother
you might be able to fix some of my
problems if you really applied yourself
to it
I I feel like she was thinking that you
know I'm doing some mind reading now
but uh then Matt Walsh comes along and
fixes her problem here's a hundred
thousand dollars it's already pledged
right people actually put their credit
cards in there they pledged a hundred
thousand dollars so Grandma's problems
are fixed
and then Grandma finds out
and I don't know if this fact is true
but then Grandma finds out that somebody
in her family decided to turn it down on
her behalf
well there's your hundred thousand
dollars Grandma write down the crapper
so as as political pranks go
this was one of the best because number
one it didn't cost him anything because
the GoFundMe ended up getting canceled
the Democrats proved that they would
shoot themselves in the foot rather than
rather than solve a problem
they would rather shoot themselves in
the foot
than solve a problem and you've never
seen it more cleared cleanly laid out
here's my problem oh okay here's a total
solution completely done no ambiguity
no no nothing's nothing's missing you
needed some money here you go
and then they took it away
I mean you can't do a prank that works
out better than this although it's kind
of cruel for the grandmother and I wish
he'd gotten her money I mean the prank
worked the prank worked just as well
whether she got her money or not
so can she get her money
I mean it feels like Grandma should get
some money out of this she was part of
the she was part of the the show
all right so the Republicans had their
uh convention last night and Trump was
the the you know I guess the most
interesting featured speaker
and we're getting a sense now what the
Republicans will be pushing in 2022 and
Beyond for their main themes
so I'm going to run by you what I think
will be their main themes based on what
they've said so far and let's judge them
all right put your persuasion head on
persuasion head on are these good ideas
for Republican
um you know political interests
and it looks like these are the major
themes number one uh Trump said that
China is responsible for the virus and
should pay 10 trillion dollars in
reparations
now when Trump says China should pay 10
trillion dollars in reparations is that
good persuasion or bad judge's technique
have I taught you anything
well I won't wait for your answer
because uh it's good it's really good
persuasion
Trump is just good at this you know you
don't realize what good looks like
persuasion wise until until he comes
back into the headlines the moment Trump
enters the headlines
it's good persuasion again it's like
it's been missing the whole time and
then he comes in he goes well let me
show you how to do this again all right
you don't say
China we think maybe you owe us
something
you don't say I don't know maybe we
should look into this you don't say uh I
think they're a great economic uh
problems caused by China hand waving
hand waving China China that's bad
persuasion let me show you what good
persuasion looks like
China you owe us 10 trillion dollars
that's good persuasion all right the the
fact that it's a big round number
is perfect
it's perfect you can't forget 10
trillion how many of you will hear 10
trillion
and never forget it for the rest of your
life
you probably remember that number for
the rest of your life
imagine any other number that you were
to remember for the rest of your life
good luck
good luck come up with any number like a
number
that a politician says that you would
remember for the rest of your life
I'll bet 9-1-1 somebody says
yeah maybe maybe uh nine uh justices of
the Supreme Court but basically
there's almost no such thing
as a number that you remember forever
this you know unless there's like 9 11
event or something so Trump has this
amazing ability to just say 10 trillion
sticks in your head it's an insanely big
number
feels like it could be in the
neighborhood like your brain doesn't
reject it your brain does not say it's
too big it really doesn't
but it's so big so here's the magic of
Trump's approach
how do you come up with a number
that is insanely big
and your brain still says yeah it's
probably in the neighborhood
it's pretty close
he he took two things that can't fit
together
and he made them fit together and then
your brain can't release on it because
two things that don't fit together just
were made to fit together you don't
forget that
how do you do that
right he makes it look easy
because you're saying to yourself I
think you're making too big a deal about
this he just threw out a big number no
no
he's so consistent with the way he does
this right that's not an accident it's
not just throwing out a big number this
is designed it's designed in uh designed
to persuasion and designed perfectly
um the other thing that the Republicans
are going after heart is critical race
Theory remember Republicans like an
enemy everybody likes an enemy in
politics right but the Republicans their
enemies are going to be China
I give that an A plus for a technique
critical race Theory
that's going to get people to the polls
right
that's gonna that's gonna get people out
of their chairs so they know the things
that will get people to stand up and
certainly within the Republican party if
you say your kids are going to be
brainwashed to think they're inferior
that's going to get you to the polls
all right the other enemy is Dr fauci
Dr fauci is the face that the
Republicans and Trump in particular uh
they're going to put shauji's face on
the idea that experts should be trusted
in all cases
or that the experts are always right and
then and and he's also on the side of
the let's say the overreaction or maybe
over conservative say the Republicans
approach to the to the pandemic
uh what did he call Trump called uh
fauci a radical Massacre
a radical Massacre he wants multiple
masks Etc now as soon as you heard that
Trump said fauci is a radical Massacre
you knew that was a keeper right once
again Trump comes up with a phrase let's
just add line he's a radical Massacre
now everybody else has been talking
about fauci why did it take Trump to
come up with a nickname that's you know
certainly going to be the headline today
if it doesn't stick
he's got that gift and then of course
the Republicans will be going hard
against what they would call election
fraud
so uh that looks to be their four big
ones China critical race Theory fauci as
a stand-in for all bad experts and then
election fraud
um apparently there was some booing when
the Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and got
up there and I think the Secretary of
State uh rafsenberger got some booing
too and that that is shown as a is being
reported as evidence that Trump has
control of the Republican party what do
you think does Trump still have control
of the Republican Party
feels like it because he has control of
the public
he has control of so much of the public
that the Republican Party pretty much is
going to have to give him what he wants
unless something changes
um
so you know all the all the news was
about Trump this morning if you looked
at uh CNN the entire top part of the
news where all the important stuff is I
think it was all Trump stories
and and CNN was having a total Trump
jasm this morning they're like Trump
said what oh
Trump gave somebody a nickname oh
Trump accused China of 10 trillion oh
so they're just having this massive
serial orgasms over the fact that
Trump's in the news again one of the big
stories was uh Trump wearing his pants
backwards
what
so on Twitter there are all these
pictures of what appear to be Trump
wearing his pants backwards
now I don't believe he wore his pants
backwards let me just say that but there
is a photograph
where his pants don't have a zipper
it looks like it was it looks
Photoshopped it looks like somebody just
photoshopped the zipper out and the
story was about the wrinkles in his
bands and uh blah blah but uh I think
it's photoshopped because I don't think
he was wearing pants that have no zipper
but that's what the photograph looked
like
um
here is a hypothesis that I would need a
fact check on so Twitter user Adam uh
tweeted this at me this morning and I
thought it's worth mentioning can
somebody give me a fact check on this
and it's a an innocent explanation for
why Sunday morning voting might have
been limited remember when you heard
that the Republicans want to limit the
voting on Sundays to you know certain
hours and you said to yourself voter
suppression they're trying to keep the
churches from voting uh or moving their
people to vote directly after church
it's a trick to stop the black voters
from being effective
well one of the other explanations is
and when you hear this it's going to
make you mad
that nobody told you this before
now I think this is true but do me a
fact check because I can't say I'm
positive and it goes like this that in
some places uh churches are also the
polling place
did you see that coming
the church
is also
the polling place so you can't have the
church being a church at exactly the
same time and day that the church is a
polling place
so it turns out that this change might
have at least had something to do with
the fact that they don't want to make it
hard to go to church
give me a fact check on that is that
true that the real reason for the law
was to make sure that you had time to go
to church
and that they didn't use it as a polling
place on Sunday morning when you wanted
to use the church
for a church
is that all this was
now I never believe anything is all it
was right so even if there was a
perfectly good reason it might also have
an effect on you know suppressing some
votes
so I don't I don't think
um
okay I'm seeing people confirm it
oh some John says yes my polling place
is a church
so doesn't it make sense that you should
not make it illegal to do polling before
11 A.M
because that's when you're churching
is that the whole story
I mean is is that actually the whole
story
because I don't know
it doesn't feel like it could be the
whole story it just feels a little too
simple
but did we go this far without that
being a headline
did nobody nobody brought that up until
I saw it from a user on Twitter like
that wasn't on CNN
nobody on Fox News thought to mention
that has anybody even heard this before
how do we get this far
in the in the topic that I've talked
about in public
I've talked about this topic in public
and yet I heard this this fact or I
guess is a fact
this morning
how how in the world
I would consider myself
maybe you can judge me too
if you were to judge all the people in
this country in terms of how well
informed they are on political stuff
where would you put me
if you've watched me long enough would
you would you say it's safe to say I'm
in the top 10 percent
of citizens who are well informed about
politics would you give me that top 10
percent
because I feel like if you just pay
attention to it and it's part of your
job and you do it every day you're
probably the top 10 percent
right now it might be higher but for the
purposes of by a point
if I'm in the top 10 percent
and I didn't know about this Sunday
churches as polling place thing until
today
how uninformed are we I mean seriously
people I should be in the upper realm of
well-informed people and I'm not even
close
if I were to judge how well-informed I
am
yeah and let's say well-informed means
that you know enough about the context
of things to make good decisions I'm not
even close
and if you think you're close maybe you
should examine that
because I do this literally I guess you
could say I do it for a living you know
at least part of what I do and I didn't
know that it's like the most basic part
of the story I think
or it's or it's not true
all right
that's possible maybe it's not true and
I still don't know how did we get this
far
into the biggest story in the country
which is you know are people gaming the
elections and I don't know that that
basic fact about the Sunday morning
voting how do I not know that by now
I mean seriously
all right
um
Twitter is having a little fight over
there in Nigeria so what happened was
looks like the president of Nigeria
was uh blocked on Twitter uh because he
said some things that violated Twitter's
rules
and he said I don't know some part of
part of his population would be punished
for bad behavior so Twitter blocks the
president and then the president bans
Twitter in all of Nigeria
and then Twitter complained in a tweet
of course so Twitter policy tweet said
this we are deeply concerned by the
blocking of Twitter in Nigeria access to
the free and hashtag open internet is an
essential human right in modern society
we will work to restore access for all
those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to
communicate and connect with the world
hashtag keep it on
do you see any uh
Waterloo inconsistency
is ready inconsistency that is
highlighted by this story
well let me point it out for you
um
Twitter bans people for speech that they
consider over the line of their of their
terms of use
and they consider that entirely
appropriate
that Twitter makes the decision of what
is allowed and what is not allowed
Nigeria
has adopted Twitter's hypo Theory
that somebody can make decisions about
what is allowed and what is not allowed
because if Twitter can make decisions
about what is okay for the public and
not okay
why can't others what is it did was
there a constitution or
was there some kind of law or natural
law that says that Twitter is the only
group that gets to decide what is okay
and what is not okay for speech
no no Nigeria can do it too so if
Twitter could make those decisions and
Facebook can make those decisions
Nigeria you can make those decisions
right be and when Nigeria does it you
say whoa wait a minute because your your
decision about what to allow and what
not to allow is is a bad decision
that's not the issue
the issue is not whether it's a bad
decision
the issue is who gets to make it right
the decision is not whether Twitter
always makes the right decision
about who's on and who's out the
question is who gets to make it
who gets to make it Nigeria says we get
to make it
do they
yeah I guess they do
Twitter says we get to make it do they
yeah I guess they do
unless somebody else makes it for them
like in Nigeria now of course I would be
in favor of Twitter winning this battle
and getting access back to Nigeria so
I'm definitely backing Twitter over
Nigeria on this topic but I love how it
highlights
the problem with the philosophy which is
if some people can decide what you can
see
and it's up to them
and it's subjective
then other people can do it too all
right it's either all or none on that
subjective censoring
so I want to say this again because I
don't understand why it's not the way
it's framed nationally
so apparently the U.S the Biden
Administration and the U.S Department of
Justice they've elevated this ransomware
business to similar priority as
terrorism
now what they're doing is making sure
that all ransomware reports are reported
centrally and they'll have some kind of
a group that will look at it more
holistically to get a better idea of
who's doing it and how to stop it and
all that stuff now uh compliments I'll
give my compliments to the Biden
administration because I'm not a
partisan in uh in all things I'm
partisan in some things I guess
everybody is but I tried not to be
partisan on certainly
you know any kind of National Defense
things and if Trump had done this I
would have said it's the right decision
and Biden's doing it I'll also say it's
the right decision
to just make this terrorism
I will go a little bit further than
Biden's Administration and say that if
we determined that we could find these
people
and let's say Russia wasn't willing to
to uh to pick them up we should drone
them
so if we can find the bad guys the
hackers and they happen to be in Russian
territory we should kill them where they
stand
and we should send cop send copies of
the mission to Putin
show them all the video
tell them everything we did completely
transparently after the fact after we
killed them so we should kill them
and then we should build Putin Bill
Putin
we should send him the bill
for killing his citizens
now that's persuasion
bad persuasion would be just to kill him
on Russian territory
because that would be an act of War
right it's an active War to kill a
Russian citizen on Russian territory
I would think
so instead of making it look like an act
of War send them the bill
send them literally and itemize the
 bill say Putin this is what you
should have done
right these are your guys you didn't do
it we're going to kill your
people and we're going to give you the
 bill and if you don't pay it
we're shutting down all trade
pay the bill
now if you're story Putin is that these
guys don't work for you then let's let's
keep that story
we'll take care of it for you we'll send
you the bill you better pay it
all right that's how I do it I don't
think Biden will do that but you know I
do not I would not
rule out the fact that Biden's a badass
on this stuff
I don't know if he's going to be a
badass on China he's got a little China
problem
but I do think Biden has at least a
chance we'll give him a chance we'll see
what happens I think Biden might push
pretty hard on Russia we'll see
uh El Salvador made a big move today
so El Salvador's president he's going to
send a bill to his Congress to make
Bitcoin legal tender
uh in their country
so El Salvador will make it legal to
accept Bitcoin and I think part of the
reason for that is that people living
abroad can send remittances back home
more easily by Bitcoin now
I don't know how many
how many countries it will take or
businesses to accept Bitcoin before it
makes a big difference to the price but
this feels like a big deal it did not
however
uh change the price of Bitcoin
so I thought that Bitcoin might get a
little pop on this news but it actually
would last I checked it was down one
percent we'll see if it makes a
difference
um do you know what our system of
government has evolved into
you know I feel sorry for the founders
and it's a good thing that they stay
dead you know the founders of this
country because when they came up with
the Constitution and they designed our
system I'm not so sure
somebody says preach I did the same with
fentanyl yeah maybe so I put a put a
drone attack on their fentanyl dealers
and send them the bill that's not a bad
idea by the way the sending the bill
part is the persuasion
because when you send the bill that's
all anybody's going to talk about
if you Bill them there's going to be a
physical bill
and people are going to look at it and
they're going to look at the itemization
so billing Putin for killing his his
hackers or billing uh president XI for
killing their fentanyl dealers changes
the frame it changes it from we attacked
your country to we just did you a favor
you owe us
and it's a big deal
I think yeah we'll we'll never do
anything like that but that's that's the
idea of it
um so we have a system in which whoever
the leader of our country is always
selected at this point
the leader well even Congress I would
say uh they're all selected
based on who can game the election
system the best
uh there's plenty of documentation that
shows that Biden probably won
because the Democrats just did a better
job at using the legal system to get a
set of rules that favored their outcome
so it didn't really probably have much
to do with the voters preferences
probably had a lot to do with who gained
the system better now the complaints
from the Democrats are that the
Republicans are catching up and they're
regaming and you know reaching they're
changing the system so it might favor
them
but you do all this work to create a
democracy and have these elections and
basically the outcome is determined by
the people who who make the rules so the
the rule makers are the ones who decide
who got elected
um
but on top of that
when it's all said and done and you've
elected your leaders then the next part
of the next phase is ignoring the
leaders because the only person that
matters is Joe manchin
because as long as things stay really
close you know if Congress is really
close to even Republicans and Democrats
then the only person who has any power
is a person who's willing to sometimes
vote on the other side and that's Joe
manchin
so Joe manchin is the only smart person
in Congress because he's openly told the
world I could vote this way but I could
also vote that way
that's all you have to do when you run
the country
that's it
somebody says Kristen Cinema maybe maybe
another one yeah so
uh I don't know what's wrong with
everybody else in Congress all they have
to do is sometimes vote for the other
teams and then you're in charge of the
country
but I suppose you need to be more loyal
to your party these days so Mansion is
probably paying paying the price from
his own party
but it's a clever move I would have done
the same thing if I were in Congress and
I saw this opening
the way Mansion does
I would have said to myself wait a
minute wait a minute
can I understand this correctly all I
have to do is sometimes vote for the
other team and I can actually be running
the country
I would take that in a heartbeat
I would be all over that
I would run this country
if they give it to me I mean basically
it would be the whole country just
handing you the keys
and say could you can you decide for us
because we can't really decide Joe
manchin can can you just make up the
decision for us you know we don't like
all this representative democracy we'll
just let you do it
Joe manchin
so I did a little uh reading up on the
problem with meta-analyzes
so I've mentioned that uh you know the
story about Ivermectin the proposed
potential therapeutic for covid that
there is some suggestion that if you do
a meta-analysis which is you sort of sum
up all of the imperfect studies
that the imperfections can be sort of
smoothed out if you will speaking very
approximately here
uh if you add them all together and
treat them as one big study even though
they were individually imperfect studies
and uh Andres backhaus who knows more
about the stuff that I do had mentioned
there's some problems with
meta-analysis and I didn't know exactly
what they were but here's here's the uh
let's see the idiots version
the idiot's version is that if you were
to do a an analysis of studies so you're
looking at a whole bunch of studies
and you're deciding how to add them all
together into one big ball
you have a lot of decisions that you
make
um
oh I see your comments uh are Crowley
and I don't understand all that context
but maybe I should
uh so the question on the meta-analyzes
is that if you're looking at which
studies to include in your meta-analysis
then it's automatically subjective
so apparently one of the things you
might do is you say we're going to do a
meta-analysis of all the studies but of
course we're going to leave out any of
the pre-print stuff so the pre-print
stuff is the stuff that hasn't been you
know published in a major publication
and peer-reviewed and all that it's like
before that stuff happens so do you
include that
should you include stuff that's not
quite
far far enough along in the pipeline
because if you decide not to include it
you might get a different result than if
you included it
uh there might be other criteria where
you say well I'm not going to include a
study unless it's at least a certain
size has to have a certain number of
people or is done in a certain place or
they looked at it in a certain way maybe
in the beginning versus later on
so my point is that the outcome of the
meta-analysis is determined by the
person who decides what to look at
all right lose I see you saying I'm lost
let me see if I can do this one more
time clearly
if you're going to put if you're going
to look at a bunch of individual small
studies
to to kind of take their average
direction if you will
you still get to choose what's in the
average
and what you decide to put in there will
determine what the average is
so you can say to yourself I'm not going
to include this kind of study because
it's not the kind that looks good enough
or you could say let's include
everything because the whole point of it
is to average out
so the point is that you think you're
doing an analysis but you're not
it's a it's a an illusion of analysis
because the illusion is that there's
some kind of objective process going on
when nothing like that happened in fact
it was subjective because you chose what
you were going to look at and it was the
choosing what you look at that probably
determined the result now
here's the counter to the counter
if if every one of the studies
shows a strong effect in the same
direction
probably none of this matters right so
if if a hundred percent of the studies
showed that let's take an example I
don't think this is true but if 100 of
the studies showed that Ivermectin
worked really really well
it wouldn't matter which one you picked
because they'd all be the same
but if that were also true you wouldn't
need a meta-analysis
so here's what one expert said
the situation where you don't need a
meta-analysis is where it's so obvious
without one that you don't need to do it
but the moment it's not obvious
the meta-analysis also doesn't work
because that's when you put the
subjectivity into it
so the meta-analysis actually is
logically illogical
meaning that you either don't need it or
it doesn't work those are the only two
possibilities you don't need it because
it's so clear without it
or if it's murky it's really subjective
and it doesn't work
now
what's the counter to that uh and I
think in the Ivermectin study I believe
the counter is that they're all in the
same direction
that the entire point of it is that
there's nothing in the other direction
so in that case a meta-analysis I think
actually makes sense
but you can't trust it because of its
subjectivity or let me say this maybe
you didn't need the meta-analysis
so it fits that model you didn't need it
because they're all in the same
direction now fact check me on that I
don't know if they're all in the same
direction but I feel as if that was the
main point is that they were in fact all
in the same direction
um
and that
was some of the few things that I needed
to talk about today
um I feel as though
we're entering the summer where things
are going to slow down a little bit and
I would like to ask this question of you
I told you yesterday that in my town
there's some kind of a golden age
situation going on my Main Street turned
into a like a festival every weekend you
know with that the street is closed to
traffic and it's outdoor dining people
have their masks off people are so happy
they can't stand it
um oh thank you Ron I'm going to mention
that in a moment and
uh is anybody else having the experience
that their town is just insanely happy
right now
um
gun control is racist says uh marusha
that the Republicans should say that
yeah
um I'm not sure Republicans feel as
comfortable as you might imagine saying
that gun control is racist
um but I see your point yeah I can see
your point it's just that'd be a hard
message for the Republicans to take all
right back to your town
um somebody says Santa somebody says yes
in Texas no in Santa Cruz my town is
happy
Portland isn't very happy
New Jersey not so good I see a yes from
Karina
um
no I'm in Canada I'm sorry not in Canada
Canada is sad
uh all the Canadians are complaining
here I'm gonna Canada is not too happy
uh
yes Jan says a lot more people around
walking that's definitely true
where is Jack ma yeah that's a good
question
Montana is great New York City sucks
Connecticut good Atlanta definitely New
York City is back baby
um Wichita has been great for a while
Philadelphia is the pits sorry Missouri
yes
all right well it looks like we're
coming back folks we're coming back how
about taking a moment
take a moment for me to go back in time
do you remember about this time last
year
people were afraid that the entire
economy
was going to fall apart all right
and it didn't
it didn't
and we did rally
and we beat this damn thing I mean I
think it's beaten even if it lasts
forever I mean we're back to nearly
normal at this point and we're looking
good
so I feel like we all live through
something amazing and I think we'll all
be changed because of it and changed in
lots of ways
but I think the Golden Age
is just going to impress itself upon us
whether we like it or not and I so feel
that the pandemic was some sort of
system reboot
that the pandemic did more than anything
I've in my life to just change
everything
about the way you think about people you
you had to re-engineer your entire life
from scratch
um and I would like to ask you this
question how many of you
are having trouble rebuilding your
friend Network and social network is
there anybody who lost their social
network during this pandemic whose needs
used to rebuild it and you're saying
we're all my friends I need some friends
now
just want to say in the comments that if
that's a common problem or not
Kevin says oh we're getting a lot of
yeses to that yep yep yep
all right so I was going to do a micro
lesson on that oh there's a lot of yeses
wow I'm sorry about that so I feel I
feel the same situation I feel like I
have to uh intentionally rebuild rebuild
my social network because it just
completely shrunked and shrunk to the
family
um
let me tell you a system for doing this
I was going to do a micro lesson on my
locals Subscription Service on how to
make friends would you like that I'm
going to give you a quick little lesson
on how to make friends
uh and
I actually wrote it on my whiteboard
over here which
you can almost see
I shouldn't have shown you that other
one I guess
um and here's the technique
number one make you friends don't think
of it as a goal think of it as a system
it's the same process I use for
everything a goal a goal approach would
be uh I think I'm going to identify
somebody I want as a friend and I'm
going to try to make that person my
friend
that doesn't really work it's hard to
just say well I I think I think you'll
be my friend I'm going to make you a
friend
I don't ever see that work
so that would be a goal approach and it
just doesn't work here's the system
approach it goes like this
number one have defined interests
become the person who cares about X now
X is up to you could be politics could
be a sport could be a hobby could be an
interest could be a Cause
find something
to Define you so that when your friends
describe you they say oh if you met
Scott he talks about politics he plays
tennis
become a stereotype here's why
as soon as you become known as the
person who does X whatever X is then all
of the other people who like X are drawn
to you and they have a reason to talk to
you and you have reason to talk to them
and your friend will say hey I know
you're interested in X you should you
should meet my sibling who also likes X
or my ex who likes X
so be the moth be the flame that
attracts The Moth
don't be the moth be the flame be the
person who says here is what I am and
now I'm going to attract stuff
so first of all have a defined interest
that other people recognize and that
will attract people of like interest so
that's the first part of the system next
be valuable
be valuable you would like to live in a
world in which friendship is based on
some let's say
um conceptual value that you'll just say
you know
I like people
people are good I like Bob Bob's a good
person Bob's my friend
I'll tell you how a goal is different
from affirmations in a minute
um
friendship is a transactional situation
your family might not be in your family
you might have something close to
um you know complete love without any
restrictions but friends are
transactions now you don't want to think
of it that way but I'm sorry it's just
true it's always true your friends are
people for whom you provide a value and
they provide a value back if that's not
happening get rid of your friend
unless a sport I suppose they're giving
you value and you're giving them nothing
that'd be okay for you but it's only a
friendship if you both know what you're
getting and you're both delivering it
for example you might be valuable
because you're funny
and people say I love being around a
funny person you might be valuable
because you're you're an empath and
people say man when I have a problem I
sure like talking to X you might be
valuable because your home is a good one
for getting together you might be
valuable because you're an organizer
you're the person who brings everybody
together you might be valuable because
you have lots of friends and people want
to be your friend to have access to your
network of friends but make sure you
have a value if you're not offering a
thing of value why would anybody be your
friend
seriously why would they be your friend
you it's not because your your inner
your inner you your soul is so good
forget about that nobody can see your
soul nobody can see your inner thoughts
people can see what you do
so do something valuable
for the people you would like to be
friends with if you can't do something
for other people don't complain you
don't have friends
they need you to do something for them
that's how it works so get over your
your romantic Notions that friendship is
based on some you know Connection in
your soul it's not that at all it's just
people have stuff in common who have an
interest and a value that is an exchange
that's all it's transactional but
there's nothing wrong with that the the
world has gone on forever exactly with
this system you don't have to be the one
who bucks it use the system
yeah don't don't fight the system use it
it's been tested for you know hundreds
of thousands years
um
you should also either join groups or
organize them
so find a group of people who are doing
the thing that you're interested in and
join that group the best way to make
friends is simply by doing the same
stuff with people that you didn't know
that well and then you get to know them
you got something to talk about oh you
do ax I do X let's talk about X and then
you're on your way so if you can't join
a group that is of interest to you be
the organizer
are you worried that if you're the
organizer people will say no to you
here's the trick
don't say to one person would you like
to do x with me
because if you get turned down for that
that feels kind of personal doesn't it
would you like to go to a movie with me
that's tough for some people to ask
nobody likes to be rejected so don't do
that instead be an organizer and say I'm
thinking of going to movie X put out a
message to your network does anybody
want to go with me
that's it I I'm going to do something on
this day who would like to join me
then you don't know who turned you down
nobody has to answer
it's just the people who want to join
you say yes if you get nobody joining
you nobody even knows
nobody's going to know if you went to
the movie they just know you put it out
there
that's all if they didn't go they didn't
answer that's all they know so there's
nobody turning you down
and there's nobody saying yes well I
mean somebody might say yes but
so don't ask one-on-one
organize a group put in an offer offer
to host offer to create an event around
something be the organizer and next
thing is diversify and prune
don't think that your process of making
friends is to get some friends and then
you're done
no good
your process of making friends should be
a continuous process where you're adding
new friends all the time and you're
diversifying so that if you lose a
friend ah you got 10 more you lose
another friend you still got 10 more
because you added a new friend
what you don't want
is to have two friends and then one of
them gets pissed off at you and you lost
fifty percent of your Social Network
because you made one person mad right
diversify
10 friends 20 friends 30 friends that's
what you're going for and if you get to
ten and you say to yourself well that's
enough friends no because you need to
prune friends too
how many of your friends are just users
they're they're just toxic
are you getting rid of the toxic ones
because they're taking your time
you've got to get rid of the toxic ones
and some and people can become toxic
even if they didn't start that way so
you got to get rid of the toxic ones and
the only way you can get rid of toxic
friends is to have Diversified your
friend portfolio so that you can grab
one and say ah toxic get rid of it and
it doesn't even change the average you
don't even notice it it's just better
right so diversify grow your friends and
prune viciously
prune pruned viciously
um
and the other tip is there are people
who are good organizers and connectors
you probably know some if you know 20
people probably maybe only one of them
or even fewer could be zero maybe one of
them would be the person who knows lots
of people and has parties and introduces
you to people
if you're going to put any interest into
a person
find one of those all right
find one of those the organizer the
person who has lots of friends and then
how do you make that person your friend
do you call them and say hey be my
friend nope
that doesn't work and plus they might
say no you don't want to do that offer
them something
if there's somebody who's a good
organizer have a party and invite them
if you invite an organizer to three
parties at your place
there's a hundred percent chance and
let's say the organizer goes three times
to your place there's a hundred percent
chance that you will get invited to
their next party and that's the one
that's the good one that's where all the
people are because that's the organizer
that's that's how you do it
um
you you find the people who are the
highest value connectors you make sure
you put more attention toward them than
other people because they're the high
value
so somebody says I'm the toxic one then
the other thing you ought to work on
because that's that's a good comment is
don't bother to make friends if you're
an
okay
work on that
if you know you're an or you
know you're you're not very let's say
generous to your friends your problem is
not ability to make friends
the problem is if you made friends
accidentally you know your work friends
or the people that you just met casually
it doesn't matter if you're going to be
an there's no there's no point
all right so that is your uh your goal
for today now the the reason that
systems are better than goals is because
a system is something you can do every
day
so what I just described is stuff you
could be working on every day right join
a group organize a group
send a text to that organizer person
just to you know remind them who you are
that sort of thing and whereas a goal
you know you might do nothing that day
on your goal and you just feel depressed
but the system you can just work every
day to join a gym right there's
something you can do every day join a
gym people with common interests you'll
probably run into something
and then all your friends asked to
borrow money well that is a very
negative comment
um
any friends in any mafia organization
that is a weird question
now uh the question was asked what's the
difference between an affirmation and a
goal it's an excellent question and I
like to put it this way a goal would be
I'm going to get that promotion at work
very specific right I'm going to get the
promotion that just opened up at work
an affirmation would be uh I will become
wealthy
the affirmation allows you to be wealthy
in any way
that it's not restrictive so that's
what's good about it
a goal would be I want to get that
promotion at work you only have one
thing
what are the odds that everybody gets
that one thing they want well not nearly
as good as the odds of something good
happening
something better
so your affirmation should be in the
direction but not too specific so let's
say you want to be in love
a goal would be I will be in love with
that person
is that always a good idea or would it
be better to say I will find love
or I am loved or I'll have a robust
social life
anything like that
let me tell you a real live situation
that happened that makes me wonder about
the simulation
without getting into details the other
day I was went into town and one of the
people with me was talking about a
certain other individual in her life
uh uh and you know there'd been some
some uh situation there
and as she was talking about this one
person in her life who was a problem
that one person walked directly past us
there was only one person we were
talking about one person who was a
problem to this one person I live in a
pretty populated place right there are
millions of people that live around here
but as she was talking about that one
person and was walking in a part of town
in which neither of them would normally
be
that one person
that she was talking about walked
directly past us
now how often does that happen it
happens a lot right do you notice that
things like that happen a lot now you're
saying it's a small town but it really
isn't
because
the entire time we were walking we saw
nobody else we knew
nobody
so hundreds and hundreds if not
thousands of people and saw nobody else
that we knew
except the one person we were talking
about
yeah and and you see people say yeah
that happens to me it's one of those
things that just makes you wonder about
the nature of the world doesn't it
happens a little too often now when uh
Jake Paul
I'm sorry Logan Paul when Logan Paul was
talking about his upcoming fight with
Floyd Mayweather
um yeah and I guess that's coming
tomorrow
and Logan Paul says I'm going to break
the effin simulation
do you think that Logan Paul has noticed
that his own life doesn't seem to con
correspond to anything that statistics
would suggest
because how in the world do you become
Logan Paul in the first place
I mean that's not easy but once you
become him
how in the world do you get a boxing
match with the best boxer in the world
like how in the world oh it's tonight
people are telling me that that the
boxing matches tonight now I get I get
that it's an exhibition and I get that
people would expect Mayweather to to win
but how in the world does any of this
happen I mean really
what's my null hypothesis for the
simulation I asked that a different way
um
yeah is it a cage match or a boxing
match
I'm not sure which but I gotta say
um
the reason that people like
Logan Paul and Elon Musk
and and even me
I think the reason that we believe in
the simulation is that our lives don't
make sense
does my life make sense
those of you who have been watching me
long enough let me just ask this
question
does my life make sense like based based
on just what you've observed you know
you don't even have to know my inner
life just look at what I've done
you know what I've been involved in the
things I've touched does any of that
make sense
it kind of doesn't does it
I see yeses and no's but in my mind
it's too coincidental like it doesn't
make sense
unless we live in the simulation
um
do I have a null hypothesis for this
simulation
can you explain what you mean by that so
tell me what you mean by a null
hypothesis for the simulation you mean
an alternative an alternative to it
um
all right so I'm asking you to ask the
question in English as opposed to a
science wonky talk
will I be your friend absolutely
I might I might not contact you often
but I'm totally your friend
oh prove it's not true well why didn't
you just say that
yeah how could How Could You disprove
the simulation in other words is there
something that is there something that
if true
would prove that the simulation uh is
not true and I think the answer is that
can't happen
because if we're a simulation
then the simulation would prevent it
from being being disproved I mean would
be built into the simulation that you
can't disprove it so I don't think that
the normal rules of disproving things
could be applied
to the rule of rules it will be the only
time that you would not expect it to
work I would think
uh
well somebody says can you prove
something doesn't exist you could prove
something's not true
that could be done
um
but you can't always prove it doesn't
exist
for example I could prove you know that
I don't have something in my hands
right now
but I can't prove that I won't be you
know hit on the head with a rock next
week
so that's the worst example you ever
heard just forget I forget I was talking
all right
um is truth singular I don't think so
you can't prove reality yeah I mean by
its nature you can't really
all right do you have bad analogies
forget all of my forget all them yeah I
had air in my hands damn it
you can't prove there isn't an invisible
pink unicorn in the room with you
yes
all right that's all for now and I will
talk to you
tomorrow
