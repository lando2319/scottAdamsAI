good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure you've never had a better
time today and if you'd like this
experience to go up to levels that
nobody can even understand they're so up
there in the stratosphere all you need
is a CER marar glass a tanker gel s a
canteen Jugger flask a vestel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine end of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous
seabs now
go good morning Brunswick Georgia we've
been waiting for you glad you're in the
house well I have two themes for today
theme number one the gears of the
machine we're all able now to see what's
really going on in the
world way differently than we did last
year so I've got some stories about that
and
also dad's coming
home dad not a specific person I'm not
talking about Trump necessarily I'm
talking about Dad energy and you're
going to see that in the stories today
as well well let's
begin remember I told you that there
would be hit pieces on me in the coming
years
because the more the more hit pieces on
me the less credibility I'll have going
into the election here well Forbes is
out on the hit piece uh I'm one of three
people that they'd like you to know
their careers have been destroyed and in
my case Forbes says it's because of my
racist rant but also Forbes mentions
without details it's not the first time
I've been
racist that's right without offer
offering any link or
detail forb says it's not the first time
I've been
racist maybe you could give me an
example of that because I don't think I
was racist that time either anyway so it
doesn't matter what forbs says uh Forbes
is sort of the Poor Man's the
Atlantic that only makes sense if you
really follow the media World Forbes is
the poor man's the Atlantic
and the Atlantic is the poor man's
turd so it's like
turd the
Atlantic and Forbes Forbes used to be a
great publication but I think it got
sold and turned into woke
 all right uh Joe Biden says he
wants to issue a pardon to all the
current and past marijuana users Federal
pardon so it's only a federal pardon
but at
last my long nightmare is
over you know I've been a fugitive from
the federal
police for loow these most of my life
but it's good to know I got a paron from
Joe Biden so I'm definitely going to
endorse him and and vote for him now
because I got this weed paron he's also
giving out uh big raises to federal
employees I wonder if an election year
is coming
up he he's going to have he's going to
have to bribe so many people to get
reelected but anyway we got a weed
pardon it's still
illegal so rather than just making it
legal he does a weed
pardon all right
whatever
now correct me if I'm wrong but there
was a little uh there was a flurry of
trump being called a dictator and they
said he's Hitler he's musolini he's poot
he's Stalin he's
Putin and and then I started making fun
of it by saying it's more
cowbell every time they say another
another name of a a new dictator it's
like more cowbell because it's just
stupid you all the dictator stuff so I
don't think the more cowbell thing had
any effect on it but did it seem like
the the dictator thing already ran its
course like it wasn't working so they
pulled back does anybody feel that or is
it just because it was Christmas so they
said it
less I felt like we we wouldn't be
through this like wave of dictator
dictator and it made no difference and
did you see there was a post uh it was
probably untruth but it made it over to
X from Trump in which he had one of
these uh you know these Graphics that
shows your social media what words are
common to your social media experience
and the words that he he published about
himself were had like dictator as one of
the big words so even Trump is just
treating it like a
joke and I think I think that once the
other side realized we were going to
treat it like a joke yeah word cloud it
was a word cloud that dictator so the
fact that Trump would actually post that
himself because it's so
stupid kind of tells you it's not
working so that would be an example
of Dad's home or dad's coming home
because it's not so much it's about
Trump I'm not necessarily saying he's
Dad it's just the
energy it's very dad energy to say
you're a dictator and then Dad says yeah
I'm a total
dictator what's for
dinner isn't that Dad energy cuz Mom
does doesn't say
that right it's just such a dad thing to
say oh you're being such an unreasonable
dictator well yeah I guess I
am yeah Embrace and
amplify more
cowbell well IBM is being sued by
America First for race discrimination
against white people and
asian-americans and it's based on uh
James O'Keefe and his OMG
uh business he's he had a video
undercover video of the CEO of IBM now
if you didn't remember America First is
a group that Steph Miller put together
that um creates basically lawfare on
behalf of
Republicans because as you know
Democrats have done a good job of using
lawfare against Trump and various other
people on the right and so it's sort of
a uh a response so now there's an entity
Steven Miller's entity that will
initiate
lawsuits wherever it makes sense I
guess so do you remember how uh Mike Ben
and others told you that what the
Democrats did is they would create all
these uh non-government
entities that would coordinate with each
other to make it look like a small thing
was a big thing or to make it look like
somebody had support for their thing so
in other words on the Democrat side
they'd have all these fake fact Checkers
and fake Watchdogs and fake think techs
right and it's just this whole
constellation of Nos and everything not
part of the government but if you were a
uh a journalist and you wanted some
support for your story you
could say well this fact Checker says
this is not true you know but the fact
back Checker is sort of artificial and
astroturfed so as part of the Democrat
strategy to have all these
non-government entities that look
semi-reasonable to the people who aren't
paying attention so it looks like
there's a big you know uh obvious
movement in One Direction or
another well apparently the Republicans
have caught on because now you've got
this you know the OMG group is kind of a
watchdog group with their undercover
vide
but they wouldn't be nearly as nearly as
effective if you didn't have separately
Steven Miller's Group which is going to
sue those people not all of them but you
know that might might Sue some of
them dad's
home right so no more are the
Republicans going to let the let's say
the opposing team do whatever they want
now there's going to be a apparently
there's a big pocket book on that side I
don't know who's funding it but uh
they've got enough money to sue the
people they want to
sue so there you go so
um my other theme about the gears of the
machine now that you understand the
gears of the Democrat machine you can
see that the Republicans are building up
something like a response using these
non- government entities to add
intensity and power to a
message
well here's my segment I'm going to call
backwards
science backwards science backwards
science and that's uh to quote um
Michael
Kon when the news says that uh wet
streets cause rain because they don't
know how cause and effect
works well here's a provocative
statement I don't know that this is true
by the way so I'll take a fact check on
whether this is true
but uh John Arnold on X says that
vitamin D offers perhaps the most
poignant example of the problems of
observational studies in all Fields all
so here's his claim so I need a fact
check on whether this is true the claim
is almost every retroactive
observational study shows a strong link
between vitamin D levels and health
outcomes would you
agree that from whether it's covid or
anything else whenever you see a bad
outcome and you check their vitamin D
levels they're low it seems like for all
kinds of stuff so
naturally naturally what would you do
about that well you would recommend the
people supplement their vitamin D so
that they can avoid these
problems how many of you remember that
during
Co I
said there's going to be a vitamin D
correlation but it might not be
causation it might simply be a
convenient way to know if you're
susceptible in other words low vitamin D
might be a good way to know that that
anything could get you but it's not
necessarily true that if you raised your
Vitamin D it wouldn't get
you so the statement here is that almost
every randomized control trial of
vitamin D supplementation shows little
to no
benefits so in other words it is true if
your vitamin D is low you're far more
likely to have a bad Health outcome but
it is so far not
proven that raising your vitamin D makes
a
difference isn't that interesting now I
did see a denter say that in the co
studies the randomiz controlled trials
did show that it made a difference so
there was some push back on
that but it might also be that it worked
for Co but maybe didn't work as much for
other things maybe I don't know so what
we don't know is whether vitamin D is
just telling you that there's a
potential health problem or it's the
cause of
it so backward science uh I'm still my
take is I'm going to still supplement
vitamin D because I don't
know and my doctor told me to do
it so I don't think it hurts you I
haven't seen any evidence that it hurts
you so I supplemented
mine uh New York Times is suing uh
Microsoft and open AI because it says
that the the AI trained itself on New
York Times material perhaps even more
than other material so New York Times
thinks that their material maybe was a
little bit of an extra focus of the
training and that that's unfair and it's
a copyright violation they're trying to
say I don't think they're going to win
I could be surprised I don't think
they're going to win
but
um what do you do in a world where you
can write a book as I have and then you
could go to Ai and tell and ask AI to
summarize it and then it will because it
read the whole book I did that with
somebody else's book I'm not going to
mention the book but there was a book I
was interested in but never had the time
to read so I just so I asked Chad GPT to
summarize it for me and it wasn't the
greatest job but with some followup
questions I definitely got the gist of
it and so 10 minutes driving my car and
just talking to my phone you I just put
the phone on chat gbt's you know
listening mode where it's just always
active and I just have a conversation
with it about a book that I hadn't read
now did the author get paid for that
nope nope I I managed to absorb the
content of somebody's book without them
getting a
penny is that good on one hand it seems
good because then everybody can have
access to information and Isn't that
cool on the other hand couldn't I have
done the same thing just with the Google
search it it was a bestselling book
right so if you do a Google search on a
best-selling book somebody's going to
summarize it
and if you go to Amazon somebody's
already written The Cliff Notes version
you know the summary as soon as I write
a book somebody writes the fake version
of the book and it appears almost
instantly right yeah my book has all
kinds of fakes past books as well all
kinds the the summary version don't buy
the summary let me tell you why you
shouldn't buy the summary for my books
more more to the point than other
people's books because when I create a
book I use
persuasion and persuasion is a
cumulative thing meaning that repetition
matters and how you sort of build the
persuasion matters so if I write a book
that says here's a bunch of good things
you should be doing it'll make you more
successful and more happy there's no
point in writing that book if you don't
do those
things so I have to make it
persuasive so that the process of
reading the book is what makes you more
like ly to do the things if you read the
summary of my book you're going to see a
summary of good ideas and you'll have no
inclination to do them because it will
have removed actually the an equal
important part of the book part of it is
what you should do and part of it is
getting you inspired to do
it uh all summaries of books take out
the inspiring part and leave you with a
oh there's a study that says this is
good and that's not going to help you
that
much all right well Kanye who I call yay
has issued an apology to the Jewish
Community he did it in
Hebrew how many American Jews can speak
Hebrew like
10%
5%
most you say
most Amer American born
25% I would think I would think most can
do a little
bit they have to they have to get
through that to
get um yeah okay well I don't know they
answer that question so maybe it could
be a lot more than I thought it was
could be a higher percentage I don't
know how many are
fluent I know they have to memorize
certain passages and stuff for their bar
mitzah and bat mitzvah but beyond that
beyond the bar mitzvah and the Bat
Mitzvah how many people are fluent who
are uh Jewish and born in
America right I'm seeing very low
numbers anyway whatever that is so yay
gave his apology I'll give you the
English language
version and let me see we're we're just
going to evaluate this on the technique
of the
apology so I'm less interested in who
likes yay because of it or whether he's
a bad person you that's separate
conversations uh let's just see if his
apologies I
good so there are two parts of it uh
first of all so the first thing you'd be
looking for is how unambiguously you
apologize right you don't want an
apology that says I'm sorry people felt
bad that's a terrible
apology I'm sorry you felt bad this is a
fake apology
because it says you're not really sorry
for the thing you did you know you just
feel bad that people feel bad about it
um so here's what yay says quote I
sincerely apologize to the Jewish
Community for any unintended outbursts
uh caused by my for any unintended
Outburst doesn't the sentence doesn't
make sense I think there's a translation
problem uh caused by my words or actions
it wasn't my intention to hurt or
disrespect and I deeply Reg regret any
pain that I might have
caused uh and then he said I am
committed to start to starting with
myself to learn from this experience in
order to ensure greater sensitivity and
understanding in the future he
added all right let's break this down do
you think the first part of the
apologize or apology was and by the way
nobody's going to accept the apology I
don't think it'll make any difference
let's just see how he
did do you think the apology sounded
sincere sincere yes or
no I'll tell you where he lost
it it's the last part that takes all the
sincerity away you tell me do you think
this last sentence was written by yay or
by a PR person who told them to say it
here's the sentence who wrote this yay
or a PR person quote I am committed to
starting with myself to learn from this
experience in order to ensure greater
sensitivity on understanding in the
future not a chance he wrote
that himself not a chance that's
not his wording no so as soon as you see
this came from a PR person the all the
benefits are
gone at the same time he's trying to
sell an
album so I'm guessing that selling an
album involves working work with the
marketing department of some album
publisher right he's not he's not
self-publishing is he he doesn't
independently publish his music or does
he does he maybe he
does I'm assuming he has to work with
some other PR person who said we can't
work with you unless you do an
apology and it looks like they wrote it
for
him yeah it looks like they wrote it for
him so uh I mean the fact that he
approved
it probably suggests that he does feel
that a sincere andology was
appropriate so I feel you know I feel
like his head might be in the right
place that he didn't want to offend
people and he feels bad about it and
he's sorry about it probably but I would
say the technique of the
apology uh is so PR professional that I
think he lost he lost that X Factor
reality credibility
part we'll see if any more comes to that
well bjn lomberg tells us that the
hurricanes have become at least the ones
say in the US have become less frequent
in current years that would be the
opposite of what climate change
predicted um that would be the opposite
right now Gears of the
machine do you now all understand that
there's no such thing as a complicated
climate model that can predict things
such as hurricane rates in the future
you all get that now right I think
before there was a point where you
thought well maybe maybe it can predict
that but now it can't that was never
even a possibility there is no such
thing as a as a model with lots of
variables
that can predict the future does not
exist so I think this is a big change
heading into
2024 I don't know if I'm in a bubble
well I am in a bubble but I don't know
if it's because I'm in a bubble that I
think that the belief in climate model
predictability has now gone to
practically nothing does it seem like
belief in
models has decreased
is that my
imagination do do you feel do you feel
that the persuasion coming from the
climate people is far less look at my
model and far less oh it's warm in this
place and and now it's sort of it's
pulling back the persuasion a little bit
because it's not working like the
persuasion is not matching the outcomes
and it's just really really obvious
now yeah so I think this is another case
where we see the gears of the
machine
and dad's coming
home um I guess Rebel news had an
article and I saw Ian miles Jong posting
it so there's a new analysis is
predicting that by 2030 49% of adults in
the United States will be
obese and about a quarter of adults will
be severely
obese there is no word if the 2 4% who
will be severely obese answer polls
exactly the same way I think these it is
a different
25% but you know what my first take on
this was when I saw that by 2030 49 well
basically half of all adults will be
obese I thought we were already
there if you were to subtract New York
City and Los Angeles from the
base I think we'd already be there
I don't know how much you travel but if
you travel to um the Midwest or Upstate
New York or
Texas it certainly looks like more than
half of the people are obese but if you
go to La and you do a bunch of list you
say a media tour you can spend all day
in Los Angeles without seeing an
overweight
person it's the damnest thing you know
you'll see people with eating disorders
all over the place but I remember one
day I went to a uh a breakfast meeting
with some uh Hollywood types producer
types and I remember what they ordered
for breakfast and it was like it was
just like the size of you know two coins
on a plate I mean literally the entire
Mass if you had like scooped up all the
mass of the entire size of the breakfast
and just squeezed it a little bit it
would have been the size of of an acorn
that was the entire breakfast basically
the mass of an acorn and when I looked
at the people across the table no body
fat perfect BMI how do you get a perfect
BMI you hardly ever eat because if you
eat American you know poison food you're
going to get fat now how do you think
the uh
news will frame the fact that Americans
are becoming obese
well I think they'll say things like
they're getting older your age has
something to do with it they're going to
say they're uh smartphones are making
them less active right what is it
they're not going to
say yeah they're going to say oh zic
might be the PO what are they not going
to
say they're not going to say our food
sources are obviously
poison I like to say compromised I like
like to use poison for alcohol I like to
say
compromised they won't say it do you
know why the news won't say
it same reason the news doesn't attack
big Pharma because big food pretty big
advertising pretty big advertising
so can you see the gears of the
machine half the people are so going to
uh basically eat compromised food and
have horrible he Health outcomes but our
news business because it depends on the
Food business for advertising they'll
never tell you that you might never see
a
story that suggests that our food is
compromised I'll bet you'll never see it
you're never going to see a story that
says perhaps and I don't know this to be
true there might be a lot of people who
have problems with
wheat I don't know the degree of it
Beyond Celiac but apparently weat has at
least three different kinds of reactions
you can have to it that are
negative and Celiac is just one of them
so we could be part of this bigger story
as
well now did you see how carefully I had
to say that I have to say I'm not aware
of any science that would say there's
anything wrong with wheat because if if
I don't want to get oprate remember what
when Oprah got sued by the uh the cattle
people something about hamburgers or
something
yeah so if you make a claim even if your
claim could be backed up you get law
fair down a
business so I have to make sure that
when I talk publicly I say I'm not aware
of any science that says wheat will be
bad for you I'm not actually that's true
I am uh I do promote people removing
things from their diet at least long
enough to test it so I suggested for
example to my
uh audience that they should just try a
couple of weeks without wheat right now
every time you say gluten you're saying
the wrong thing let me be clear if you
say oh
wheat might have a gluten sensitivity
you're on the wrong page you're on the
wrong page it's a thing the gluten thing
is a thing but if you don't understand
the gluten is just one of three three
potential problems a person could have
with with wheat it's only one of them if
you don't understand that there's others
you're missing the bigger story now
again I'm not aware of any science to
suggest that eating wheat is bad for you
I'm no scientist I'm no doctor but I do
suggest that because there's a lot of
let's say uncertainty around
it that you can at least see what it
does to you so when I took wheat out of
my diet which I did recently um all my
joint inflammation back pains and
everything just went away and this is
after years of having major inflammation
now is it because of the wheat I don't
know I don't know I know that after
years of no progress getting my
inflammation to go away a few days after
I stopped eating wheat it was gone and
never came back so that's all I know but
that doesn't mean it's science right so
I don't want to be sued not talking
science
just an anecdotal thing so let me let me
ask you I asked the number of you to
give it a try and a number of people did
in the comments how many of you quit
wheat for a few weeks or a month and got
some kind of benefit that's
obvious I'll just read the comments yes
now there a bunch of people say no but
I'll just read the yeses yes yes yes yes
yes yes yes all right so I'm literally
really reading the number of yeses that
are going by yes yes yes
yes yes lost 10 lbs yes less Stander
analogies six years ago yes yes yes yes
yes yes and
yes now is that science no no could it
be a placebo effect yes yes it could
be what's the smartest thing to do if
you don't know should you go research
and do your own research and study the
science I would recommend against it
because I wouldn't trust any of the
science about
food because I think the food industry
has a little bit too much control over
food science the same way Pharma has a
lot of control over Pharma science so I
would just take it out of your diet and
see if you feel different here's my
here's my uh
proposal if wheat is a problem for you
specifically you will really really
notice it in two
weeks that's my proposition it won't be
subtle you'll really really notice it
now you could test it by taking out for
two weeks put it back for two weeks see
if it's different and if it really is
then go back to getting rid of it so
don't treat it like you know treat it
like you don't know but it's easy to
test
so um in other news related uh the news
is reporting that alcohol consumption is
way down so apparently the entire
alcohol
industry is just getting the kicked
out of it why is that well part of it is
the Gen Z I think is uh drinking far
less um part of it is people like me and
I'm by far I'm not alone but I'm I'm one
of a whole bunch of public figures who
now say publicly and often that they
don't drink even one
drink I've never heard so many people
say just casually in casual conversation
I don't drink as in I don't drink at all
I've never heard so many people say as I
have in the past year yeah and maybe oh
you know what maybe Trump is the reason
do you remember when um uh men wore hats
you know in the 60s and then JFK came
along and he didn't wear a hat and then
hat the whole hat business disappeared
could it be a coincidence that in the
age of
trump uh a very famous
non-drinker that drinking goes down now
what I haven't seen is that there's a
Republican versus Democrat difference if
you saw if you saw Republicans drinking
less but not Dem
Democrats then you might think it's
Trump but that hasn't been
tested here's what I think it
is I think it's a little bit that the
science is
turned the science is turned so they
used to say oh a couple drinks a day or
one drink a day might be even healthy
for you now they don't say that because
that was never true now we know that you
know even one or two drinks is probably
bad for you the other thing is uh
the other thing is the pandemic may have
changed some behaviors I don't know
you'd imagine it made people drink more
but maybe not I don't know if if you
stopped socially drinking because you
stopped being
social and I think that happened to a
lot of people I think a lot of people
drank socially and they just stopped
being social and the the drinky just
stopped at the same
time I think some of it is
weed uh weed being more prevalent being
legalized in a lot of places I think
some number of people replaced alcohol
with weed but it's not really quite a
replacement you know weed is not not
really a social party drug in my opinion
you know I I only I only use it
medically
medicinally and I don't recommend it to
anybody who would only use it you know
for uh fun don't recommend it for that
all right
um
a lot of people are
saying I feel good about
itess is uh going to look very different
in
2024 Believe It or Not th this will this
will are you ready for
this you won't believe this next
story I'm not sure I believe it but I've
got I got to see it
um so Peter bagian is uh posting that
MGM is releasing a film that suggests
Hollywood is disting itself from
wokeness now there's a movie about a
black
author who writes a book and I guess it
didn't do well so as a uh practical joke
or just kind of I haven't seen the movie
so I'm just intuiting what it's about
from just some hints so it looks like
the black
author decided to use us wokeness to get
his book published but he was doing it
cynically so he cynically wrote the
wokest book he could and then all the
white people wouldn't crazy for it and
it made him really mad because he like
damn it like I'm actually a good author
see I'm I haven't seen the movie so I
think this is the the essence of it so
it's a black guy who's getting too much
credit for being a black guy and not
enough credit for just being a good
author
so it's basically it's a comedy it looks
like and it looks like it's a broad
attack at wokeness and the the uh the
people shown are white people who are
just a little too happy about promoting
the black woke book that was actually
not even a real book yeah so uh what's
interesting about this is I can't
imagine this content ever could have
been a movie three years ago
so it does suggest that there's a shift
because this got green lit in
Hollywood
now it's only a partial win because it's
still a movie that primarily features
black people looking good and white
people looking like
 so so sort of it's only a
partial win but but the partial win is
that the black hero of the movie is sort
of condemning the wokeness and mocking
it himself
so that's pretty good but it is yet
another movie in which the white people
are idiots and the black people are
awesome now I'm going to give you a uh a
recommendation for some content I think
I told you I was watching a series on
Netflix called the Diplomat with Carrie
Russell wow is it good oh my God it
might be one of the best written casted
directed best
scenery it is so good so good now if you
give it a chance let me tell you this
I've only watched the first three
episodes I if you're tempted to bail out
in any of the episodes you have to see
the last minute of every
episode that's all I'm going to tell you
if you don't see the last minute of
every episode you won't know what
happened it's so freaking
good
however
however it's about a white guy being the
evil guy and the strong woman being the
hero and the white president being kind
of needing to being managed by his uh
black female uh chief of staff and the
other black guy who's helping the white
woman yeah
so uh
I'm going to say this about it the
quality of the show is so good that the
wokeness won't bother you too
much and I haven't seen anybody do that
before like the most of the the woke
movies are just garbage because you
can't get past the woke part this is
actually just so good you'll just like
it now here here's what I didn't mind
about
it I hate the action shows that show a
98b woman beating up a 250 PB man who's
a hardened
criminal I just go really right I I get
that even if it's a male hero they're
beating up more people than one person
could beat up like I I get that
everything's exaggerated but at least at
least if you watch Reacher you know the
show Reacher it's also a series on uh on
Amazon
um Reacher is this gigantic guy with
muscles who looks like he can ab
absolutely beat up a room full of people
so when he does it you're like oh that
looks about right but if he were a 98
pound woman I'd be like come on come on
right
so that said amazing and and and let me
tell you it's about the the Ambassador
is about the Ambassador part and the
political part which is really well
written but what what has sold me on it
is the the marriage relationship between
the the husband and the wife oh my God
that's so good the writing is the
writing is spectacular it's just
spectacular and the acting the acting is
just as good as writing it's amazing
yeah you can almost uh the the guy who
plays the
husband uh he does such a good job of
acting better than I've ever seen him
I've seen him before I don't know his
name but he's somebody you've seen
before his acting in that part is so
good you can almost hear him thinking
while he's doing it thank you
writers because the writers gave him
like
gold that they gave him such good lines
that it's just crazy anyway nothing
about
that um The Wall Street Journal
Board is saying the Dei is being rolled
back so the Wall Street Journal doesn't
have any problem having their board you
know which represents sort of their
brain brand in a way uh come out and say
the Dei is and it's being
rolled
back that's a pretty big deal they don't
say it's but you read between
the lines it's pretty clear that they're
not pro
Dei um how about anything else oh axos
same day axios is reporting uh that the
anti- Dei movement is expanding in
politics business and academics so on
one day the Wall Street Journal and
axios both reporting that a Dei is being
pulled back in its at the same
time that Hollywood is doing an anti-
wokeness
movie how much are you liking 2024 so
far like I know I know there's going to
be some challenges there might be some
black swans and some things you don't
like but there's a lot that's looking
good in terms of Trends a
lot uh Kyle Becker reports uh that the
Air Force is fighting back against uh
their uh I guess the new rules is they
can't be racist anymore and they want to
they really really want to be racist but
they're not allowed so here's a
statement from the Air Force
Academy uh says if we lose our limited
window to reshape the racial diversity
of each incoming class it would affect
our ability to meet the war fighting
imperative of Fielding a diverse
inclusive
Force
what wait
what what do any of those words
mean have I ever explained my phrase
word
thinking this is the classic word
thinking word thinking is where you try
to make some kind of
Point by putting words together where
the grammar works and you read the
sentence you go okay I know what all
those words mean and it looks like your
grammar is okay but I have no idea what
you're saying because there's no logic
to it but listen this is a phrase that
was the best uh it would affect our
ability to meet our war fighting
imperative of Fielding a diverse
inclusive Force there's no such thing as
a war fighting imperative of Fielding a
diverse inclusive
Force what does that even
mean imperative for what is the
imperative to win because I it doesn't
look like the imperative is to
win do you actually have a military
academy that doesn't have a as their
main imperative
winning I would think winning would be
right at the
top no no it's somewhere down the list
after your War fighting imperative of
Fielding a diverse inclusive force all
right the fact that the Air Force has to
weak ly and stupidly and incompetently
defend their
racism is a real good sign because they
couldn't do it they didn't have anything
there was there was no push back just
words words in a sentence well I have a
good reason why you guys shouldn't be
racist oh yeah oh yeah well how about my
counter which is words in the sentence
which have grammatical Integrity how
about that where's your reason I don't
need reasons I have words in
sentence all
right uh how about uh this news uh I'll
put this under the news is fake and no
one knows anything about
anything so John LEF laf I don't know
how to pronounce this French looking
last name L it might be leor but it
could also be le le it could also be
L I think I pronounced that correctly
and he points out in the post on X that
the New York Times had a headline in
March
2019 so during the Trump
Administration uh it said that 76,000
illegals came over in a month and we're
reaching the breaking point so the
crisis was reaching a Breaking Point
under Trump when 76,000 illegals came
out in one month wow that's a lot that's
a breaking
point I'll see how many came over uh
this month
since well since October 1st uh
730,000
so uh under
Trump one tenth as many people coming
over was reaching the breaking point
under Biden 10 times that amount is not
a real problem who says it's a
problem don't you aren't we an immigrant
country come on it's seasonal it's
seasonal people don't you know it's
seasonal and by the way we're handling
it fine there's no problem here at all
so that's your New York
Times yeah the New York Times says
76,000 is a crisis 730,000 is a it's a
minor problem we're working out I don't
see why you'd complain about that
Etc now I remind you of my earlier story
about New York times's suing uh AI chat
GPT and Microsoft because they they
trained it too much on New York Times
material well here's some of the
material that AI learned from so did AI
learn that uh 76,000 people coming
across under Trump is a
crisis did they did they learn that from
The New York Times well if they read the
New York Times They did because that's
what it
says but not so much 730 that's just
that's just being kind to people
basically I don't see how AI can ever be
smart I just don't see
it like I I get the basic idea that AI
is still in its infancy compared to what
it will be in you know mere weeks I get
that I just don't see it doesn't seem
like incremental
Improvement could get you
smarter how is it going to be smarter
than people
if it learns from people I feel like the
more it learns the Dumber it will
get am I wrong if if you took a a human
and said human I'm going to teach you
about the World by sitting you in front
of the news and you can learn about life
from The New York Times and the Atlantic
and
Forbes so here you go you got Forbes the
Atlantic and the newk your times learn
about life it's all you need to know
it's all it's all right there you that
would make you stupider that wouldn't
make you smarter so how in the world can
we have ai that's smart if it's learning
on
stupidity well speaking of stupid things
the EU is uh ramped up their attack on
uh Elon mosque essentially they're
calling it going after
X and they're launching uh formal
infringement proceedings infringement
doesn't even make sense like why why are
they even calling it
infringement when you hear what they're
complaining about there's no
infringement even in the story it's like
it's so ridiculously obviously just
going after
musk and they're blaming him for uh uh
failing to counter illicit content and
disinformation a lack of transparency
about advertising and quote deceptive
design practices
and they vow to permanently shut it down
if the platform doesn't immediately ban
alternative
media alternative
media who are they talking
about
me me I I am literally alternative
media now they're probably thinking Alex
Jones and Tucker more than
me but Tim
Po I I guess Tim P can't be on X huh
because he's what too scary Russell
Brand yeah
so let's get back to my theme the gears
of the machine do you see the gears of
the machine so American Media needs to
get Trump out of the picture musk is
running a free speech platform which as
a side effect is not going to be
suppressing Trump or his followers
so therefore musk must be removed how do
Democrats do that well if they don't
have a legal means to do it and they
don't they they create amide
entities and those amide entities can
act in all their lawfare out identity
ways to help them attack in this case
they're obviously weaponizing the EU let
me ask you this do you think the EU
would be making these actions against
musk if the United States government
specifically the Democrats had not asked
them to do it or even threaten them to
do
it now I don't think the EU would even
care would
they I doubt it no this is
clearly obviously the gears of the
machine
showing that it's a illegitimate attack
by the EU European union and is purely
political and it's anti-free
speech and it's
anti- ethical moral anti everything
that's good it's just purely
yeah now would you have would you have
known this five years
ago five years ago if you heard the EU
was going after musk would you have
realized it was all about Trump and
America probably not but now the gears
of the machine are really obvious aren't
they you know Europe Europe might need a
hand from the US maybe this is what
they're doing in
return all right uh here's an
interesting thing so somebody I guess
some people are getting banned from X
for breaking the law which is supposedly
the I think the only line that Elan mus
says you can't cross can't break the law
and the law says I think I didn't know
this was a law but you can't Advocate
murdering
civilians is that
true I didn't even know that was a
law is there a law against advocating
murdering
civilians yeah I'm not aware of it I
don't know what law that would
be so I suppose it would be inciting
violence
right but here's my problem so let let's
try to un let's try to let's say move
the fog out of this
issue so let's say somebody says
um suppose somebody said which people
did say um the response to Gaza from the
IDF should be total annihilation of Gaza
is that a case of asking for civilians
to be
murdered what would you
say oh solic solicitation to commit a
crime of violence well that's not
solicitation I wouldn't call this
solicitation but maybe somebody
would so what do you think is that
calling for the murder of innocent
people if you say the response to Gaza
should be to turn it into a parking lot
I would say
yes to me that seems like calling for
war
crimes but that's only that's only if
you interpret it
literally suppose you interpret it the
way normal people talk in the normal way
then it just means go hard at Gaza but
don't kill any babies you don't need to
kill right yeah as if you see it as
hyperbole it just means go hard at
whatever country you're mad at it
doesn't mean pave it it doesn't mean
nuke it it doesn't mean kill all the
people but it could certainly be taken
that way so there's a weird gray area
there so when Elon says you know that
you don't want to call for murdering
people I had to ask myself if I had done
that so let me tell you what I've done
and then you tell me if I've called
for uh murdering of innocent
people I said that I'm 100% supportive
of
Israel's uh reaction to O oober
7th even if I might not do every single
thing that they do
specifically I'm very in
favor of them doing what they need to do
now how could they possibly reasonably
do what they need to do without lots of
casualties of
non-combatants nobody knows any way to
do that and you could do what you can do
but realistically it's a war zone you
know non-combatant are going to be dying
so if I say I'm in favor of military
actions which guarantee innocent people
get
killed have I not called for the
destruction of innocent
people I would say I
have now that's not the point of it I
don't want anybody innocent to die and I
wouldn't want anybody to do it
intentionally but I think we have to be
a little bit realistic
that if you're calling for you know
major military action against Gaza you
know what that
includes I'm not going to say that
doesn't include innocent people getting
killed it does it absolutely includes
massive
hardship uh wounding death absolutely
but I'm in favor of it because the
alternative is worse in my
opinion or at least the alternative for
Israel's worse which is the subject
company
country so um I agree with Elon that
having a standard of not violating the
the law is a pretty good standard and
maybe the best you can do so I don't
know that I have a better way to do this
but it is a little bit
dangerous I I feel that I'm you know I'm
towing the line but I'm just only barely
on the right side of the line I feel
like it's just you know I could very
easily accidentally slide over the line
yeah um and then uh musos was sort of
challenging and said which which of the
accounts on X have called for the murder
of
civilians and he was given given many
examples but the many
examples would be in the category of say
Laura lumer saying they should you know
basically pay of
Goa now do you think when she says that
she really means kill all the men women
and children
who are non combatants I mean yeah you
have to put a little bit of judgment and
reading comprehension into I say no it's
just normal Hawk talk when there's a
military action this sort of the
ordinary
stuff all right but I agree it's a bad
idea to say it I just don't think you
should be thrown in jail for
it there's a scientific breakthrough
where they uh I guess some scientists in
Sweden found a way to add electricity to
soil although I think they're talking
about Hydroponics so I don't know what
they mean by soil but they if they add a
little electricity to the uh growing
medium it boosts the productivity by
50% so if you have an indoor
Farm they've got a technology that can
boost your production
50% now I feel like 50% now obviously is
not immediately being implemented there
might be some problems Etc but I feel
like there'll be more of this there'll
be more of these uh breakthroughs and
getting more food out of an indoor farm
and I remind you that Elon musk's uh
brother uh Kimble musk has a company
that makes indoor farming he has some
layoffs so they're not doing well but in
the long run you're going to need to
grow food on Mars so whatever Kimble is
doing would create probably at least the
base for what something like Farms on
Mars indoor Farms on Mars would look
like so anyway I'm just going to point
you to the fact that there might be huge
improvements in indoor farming that
would change
everything um scientists have figured
out a way to use a near infrared light
to cause vibrations in cancer
cells uh via something they inject into
your body that is likely to vibrate
because of the light that destroys 99%
of cancer cells in the lab not in the
person and so you probably ask yourself
how did they get that infrared
light inside the
body well they don't give any details
but I think it's obvious they put the
infrared light into a liquid uh Clorox
and then you drink the bleach you drink
the bleach no don't drink bleach that'll
kill you don't do that no no but uh
apparently you can um I'm told by people
in the comments that this near infrared
light if you shine it on a human it has
the quality that can penetrate the
surface so it turns out you can
inject
light into a box
body yeah the drinking bleach hoax was
once again Trump was
right uh Bill Bar says uh he warns about
an abuse of government if Trump gets
elected do you think that there will be
an abuse of government if Trump gets
elected I think there will be abuse of
government no matter who gets elected
because every president tries to abuse
abuse the office until they get
stopped correct me if I'm wrong every
president lately tries to do executive
orders and tries to start
wars that aren't quite Congress
approved right so uh abusing uh you know
abusing the law is sort of built into
being the president these days now it
doesn't mean there won't be counter
forces so the issue is not whether a
president would try to uh abuse
government power because they will
definitely try to do that the question
is whether the checks and balances are
good
enough and the answer is
almost they didn't quite stop uh Biden
but I do think they stopped
Trump you know I don't know which abuses
of power he didn't the first four
years well speaking of bad things the
Michigan Supreme Court has rejected the
attempt to take Trump off their
ballot
so uh which state was it was it
Wisconsin no uh
Minnesota um said he's off the ballot
but Michigan said he's on the ballot
Colorado sorry Colorado so Colorado
ruled the lower court did or one of the
courts not the Supreme Court
uh okay I have to admit I get so bored
when I talk about all this court and
stuff that I Leave Out All the
clarifying
details like what's the state what's
Federal yeah which state is involved you
know which court is involved uh but just
suffice to say that Colorado is trying
to keep Trump off the um ballot and
Michigan Supreme Court wasn't having any
of it so he'll be on the ballot in
Michigan now I I'm going to put this in
my gears of the
machine uh case do you
think if it were obvious that Trump were
a insurrectionist and it's obvious that
that's reason to keep him off the ballot
don't you think Michigan would have kept
him off
too I mean the fact that there's one
state who says oh no this is
and then there's another state that's
trying to keep him off the ballot if the
only thing you knew is that one state
said it was okay and another one said we
don't think it's okay what would you
do you would keep you would try to keep
them on the ballot if there's even one
state who looked at it carefully and
said yeah I think he needs to be in the
ballot I think that destroys the
argument for another state that says the
opposite because we always want to air
on the fact we want to air on the side
of letting the voters decide
right so if there's one state that says
let the voters decide and there's
another says we don't want the voters to
decide the Supreme Court and
indeed the the citizens themselves
should as one say in that
situation where there's that
disagreement you have to let the voters
decide you just can't let the Court
decide in that situation but I think
we're adding in that direction
well V ramaswami says uh he's going to
make some news January 15th that must be
when the Iowa uh is it caucuses do you
call the Iowa is caucuses right not a
primary per se do I have the right words
for that they a caucus so V is
predicting a win a win in Iowa is that
possible do you think V could uh pull it
out
it's not
impossible yeah it's not impossible he's
he's talking like he has a better idea
what's going to happen then we do it
would surprise me if he's telling you
this and doesn't think there's at least
a chance it'll happen I think he thinks
there's at least a good chance it'll
happen we'll see the the caucuses are
funny he must be getting a good he's
probably getting a really good reception
there and so he's got a feeling in his
stomach
but at the same time uh he stopped doing
tv ads for his campaign because he
thinks they're kind of stupid and
unproductive but when you stop doing tv
ads even though the reason he's doing it
is that they're stupid and unproductive
and they could put the money in better
places what uh what rumors do that spark
well of course as Sparks the rumors that
he's winding down his campaign and he's
really running for vice president which
he says
he doesn't run for number two I mean he
uses his own words for that but he says
uh you know he's not running for the
second spot
now I think he's telling the truth that
he's running for president I'm sure I'm
sure he's telling the truth that he's
running for president
but uh does he have a plan B well V says
he's not a plan B kind of guy he's
running for president and that's exactly
the right answer it's the right answer
if you are only running for president
and it's the right answer if you're
not it's the right answer either the way
because you shouldn't say you're running
for vice president even if you were now
I think he's legitimately trying to win
the
presidency and like the rest of us he
probably thinks that Trump is uh only
inevitable if the other side lets them
run and there's some question about that
so and well there's lots of questions
about Trump so V you know positioning
himself as the strongest replacement
should something happen to Trump is real
good
strategy good
strategy so we'll we'll see what happens
um I would not rule out that he
surprises in Iowa that could actually
happen the caucus caucus situation is
weird so it could
happen um the amuse account on X one of
my favorites
amuse uh talks about the movie hidden
figures you remember the movie hidden
figures it was about some uh black women
who worked for NASA when we were trying
to go to the moon and they were
instrumental in a very important way
that history
ignored and uh they didn't get their
due well it turns out a lot of that was
just made
up made up so in the movie they they
have to use uh separate
restrooms in reality NASA was never
segregated well during those days it
wasn't they they actually were just full
employees who were fully recognized and
did a real good
job so that's the truth the truth is
that NASA treated him like everybody
else and they did a real good
job but the the uh sort of Dei version
of it where the the ladies are the
oppressed Heroes that somehow persevere
against all this discrimination sort of
a fake version but did you know that the
Department of Education uh paid to have
it uh distributed to all the classrooms
so they could learn
history that's right is presented to
children as
fact well it was presented to the entire
public as fact so do you think our
children learn real history or is this
the history that the people in charge
want them to
learn no children do not learn real
history and they probably shouldn't I'm
not sure this is a good idea but you
don't want to teach children Real
History they can't really handle that
you need to give them the brainwash
version all right um speaking of which
so netanyahu's uh talking about der
radicalizing Gaza but he does point out
that
um both Germany and Japan were
effectively
deprogrammed so as long as they had
control over the school system you just
wait 20 years and you've reprogrammed a
generation so uh I will once again back
netanyahu's Instinct that you very much
can reprogram kids and I will once again
say doesn't work with adults you know
under 2 you just tell them that the
older people are screwing them they're
just stealing your money and they were
always lying to you and young people are
just primed to believe that they'll
believe the last person they hear saying
that the one before was lying to them it
just doesn't work with adults adults are
too locked into their
opinion yeah so netan Netanyahu is right
they absolutely could introduce uh let's
say moderate
Islamic clerics and imams or whatever
whatever they are uh to actually teach
in the schools now I think they would
have to bring in somebody with religious
credibility so the leaders of Hamas you
know of course make an appeal to
religion but they're not religious
people themselves like they're not
professionally religious people you
would need
professional you know religious people
to deprogram the kids cuz they needs to
come from God right basically you need
to say look uh these Hamas leaders they
misinterpreted
God you know they they tried but they
misinterpreted so we're the experts so
we're telling you that they got the God
thing wrong and that what you need to uh
be doing is you know be nice to your
neighbors and that's what God wants so
you could definitely reprogram youth
that's a very practical thing what you
can't do is uh rebuild Gaza and let it
run the way it was can't do that so
Israel will have to have um complete
control over the security situation in
the West Bank in Gaza that's where
they're headed and they're going to have
to have complete control over the school
system and without that they don't have
a chance but I think that's where it's
heading all
right uh
um ladies and gentlemen this concludes
the best live stream you've ever seen
and would you agree with my themes that
we can see the gears of the machine more
clearly than ever before for example we
could see that the Biden crime family
was doing exactly what we thought it was
we know that the 50 people who signed
the laptop letter uh we're part of an
intelligence op on the on the public we
certainly can see that clearly now we
know that all the woke
stuff was from the start and
really just a power grab and a and a
grifter kind of a thing we we know that
ESG was how some rich white people tried
to make themselves look like Heroes but
was never good for the
country any part of the country
and we've seen that even the election uh
integrity
is coming under some let's say
uh pretty rigorous questions at the
moment so I although there is no proof
that the election was
rigged here's something that nobody's
ever argued with me about this is the
ultimate kill shot when I say well uh we
do know that every single institution in
America is corrupt and we've learned
that if you didn't already know it we we
learned it
recently except for all of those
elections huh all 50 states all run
clean good for us because everything
else was corrupted and we know it but
not all of those elections 50 separate
highly political highly valuable most
important thing that we do in this
country ah was so lucky that all of that
went perfectly and We Know It And we
know it see that's the good part not
only did it work perfect perfectly the
elections but we know it we know it you
know you might say to yourself Common
Sense requires that you couldn't
possibly know if somebody cheated and
got away with it all you would know is
that you didn't catch it so you might
say to yourself no we only don't know if
anybody did it but
no we're being told that we do know that
it didn't happen because we didn't look
for it and didn't find it
and for a while people were buying
that people were buying that it didn't
exist because we didn't look for it you
know very
hard so I think that I think that fairy
tale is leaving people's minds
so um YouTube thanks for
joining and I will talk to you
tomorrow bye for
now
