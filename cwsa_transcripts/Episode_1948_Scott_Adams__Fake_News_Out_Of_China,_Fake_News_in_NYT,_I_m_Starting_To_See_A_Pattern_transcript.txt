foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a finer moment in your life I
know you'd probably like the birth of
your children maybe your wedding day but
those are nothing compared to this
experience and if you want to take it up
to yet another level and I know you do
all you need is a
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
but it's gonna happen right now go
ah yeah that's good
that's good
well let's talk about some things
um a Twitter user named Peter Wang
stop it
that's his actual name don't make fun of
him
just because his first name and his last
name are a penis
Peter Wang
that is no reason to mock him that's not
kind don't do that because that's not
what this is about
Peter Wang had a very good tweet
um
which was neither about his Peter or his
Wang
but he said quote
um I just had a 20-minute conversation
with chat GPT that's a an artificial
intelligence that's available to the
public about the history of modern
physics
if I had this as a tutor during
high school and college OMG I think we
can basically reinvent the concept of
education at scale College as we know it
will cease to exist AI will be your only
user interface to everything including
education
yes
yes Peter Wang
you have nailed this
the only thing I want for education is
AI
now you say to yourself but Scott
AI will not be as good as a human
teacher who's reacting and all that to
which I say you are right
on day one
on day one
happens on day two
of AI versus all the human teachers
on day two
AI or well not technically day two but
let's say year two on year two
AI has already tried uh 3 000 different
ways to just to explain something
and attract who got the best test
results based on which way it chose to
explain the same topic
once I found out that people got much
better test results when it explained it
this way it starts doing it that way
from now on maybe test it a little bit
just in case it can do even better what
did the human teachers do
during that year when the AI went from
I'll just guess what will work to oh I
have great data and I know exactly what
worked and this gets better test results
what did the human teachers do
differently
they introduced a some gender
reassignment classes or something I
don't know
but but I'll tell you what they didn't
do is know exactly what worked and what
didn't and then change change to what
worked but hey I did
by year three
no human classroom would be able to
compete with AI because AI would have
tested
you know very completely all the way
through test scores to know what worked
and what didn't and then it would be
over
the the only interface I want for
anything is AI
I don't want to do a Google search where
I open a web page and there's a little
box I gotta find the box and type in my
little thing and type it right and I
don't want any of that I want to be
walking to my car which is a
self-driving car and I want to say I
wonder when the next Warrior game is Hey
when's the next Warrior game and next
Warrior game will be Tuesday or seven
o'clock
that's that's what I want I just want to
say it and have the answer appear in my
earpiece and yet it won't be my car
right I won't own the car and I'll be
happier
I don't think anybody I don't think any
of you quite understand
how right Klaus Schwab is about not
owning things and being happier if he's
the one who said it I think he did
let me let me give you a little insight
from being rich
you ready for this
so I've I've experienced not having
money you know the first part of my life
and if I experience having lots of money
and one of the things I like most about
going on vacation
is what what do you think is one of the
things I like most about
being on vacation
getting away from my money
because my money bought all these
complications I've got a car that's
breaking down I've got 600 you know
pieces of appliances that are not
working at my house I've got leaks I've
got I've got mail coming in I've
got to clean the house I've got a dog
it's all because of money right when I
go to vacation I'm actually escaping my
own money it's a vacation from my money
so if you're telling me that you know I
want to own a lot of things like being
in my name because that's what will make
me happy you've never experienced going
from poor to rich
if you've ever gone from poor to rich
you know your doesn't make you
happy
right you're still going to buy it
because you can right
I was watching I was watching a video of
Andrew Tate by one or three new Bugattis
or something because he's got some big
Fleet of of expensive cars they look
very happy
he seemed very happy when he was doing
it but I think only the buying it and
the talking about it makes him happy and
maybe driving it two or three times but
then after after his he gets through his
happiness
and that is part with his other Bugattis
does it still make him happy
or is it a little bit of work
to have maintenance and you know storage
and everything for yet another car
I don't know yeah maybe it does work for
him he seems to have a good system
but uh if you believe that having a lot
of stuff makes you happier I guarantee
you it doesn't
you'll still get them like I'm not
saying I'm going to stop buying things I
want I mean I just bought a electric
guitar that clearly I did not need and I
liked it I really enjoy every time I
look at it makes me happy
but it's also a pain in the ass right it
adds a whole bunch of complexity to my
life
all right
um yeah AI will be everything
I've got a question about the Snowden
and Assange issues about Assange mostly
but
the question is whether they should be
pardoned
why wouldn't we have a trial
is the belief that our our uh our
justice system is so unfair that we can
have a a trial that the whole country
watches
because that's what I yeah I've seen a
lot of yes so
now I agree with you
that our justice system can be biased
and not give us the best answers but we
use it for everything else
like why would you make why would you
make an exception for this one thing
don't you think the government itself
would be on trial
you know here's my take
um
I don't know the whole details
of what Assange and Snowden did I
haven't really heard the argument from
let's say whoever wants to prosecute him
the CIA Etc
so I mean I've heard the basic argument
that it put people at risk and it was
theft of materials and stuff and then
the counter argument is was just
journalism
so I'd like I'd like to see the uh I'd
like to see this case played out in
public
now I get that you don't trust that this
specific case would be handled right
however
I feel like if the whole country is
watching it's a lot harder for anybody
to you know play fast and loose with the
rules
so
as much as I don't want to see somebody
put at risk if they have not committed
any crimes
I don't know what they have done
like I'm a little hesitant to go full
pardon without knowing exactly the whole
details of the arguments
but I'd like to know the arguments
so you're saying the government on trial
would be a closed-door trial I'm saying
somebody's shouting at me there would be
a closed door trial do you think it
could be
do you do you think that you could put
Assange on trial and say we're going to
show some things to let's say the jury
but the public can never know these
things because they're Secret
well if if that's the case then there's
no way to have a fair trial
because I think transparency would be
pretty important
now that would be interesting I would
think that that would be a Supreme Court
situation
because that would not be equal justice
would it
I I would argue that equal justice
requires some amount of transparency for
the entire public not just the people
involved in the trial but of course
there are plenty of cases where you do
have to have that
uh privacy
so I don't know I I'm I'm biased toward
having the trial
because I think it's terribly unfair to
Assange
if it turns out no crimes were committed
it's terribly unfair
but
but he put himself in the position where
he was trying to create a public good
and put himself at risk
would you agree that he knew he was
doing that the dosage knew he was taking
a risk
he was doing it for the public good
maybe his own reasons too but and I
think this is more of that
I would like you know I hate to put
other people at risk you know he should
make his own decisions but he did make
his decision to be in this domain
and if a little bit more risk on Assange
could produce yet more benefit of the
kind that even Assange would like us to
have
I don't know
I don't know it would be
it'd be real interesting to have as a
trial
I I understand the argument for just
pardoning him I totally get it
but I feel like there's more benefit the
country could get by just knowing more
about this situation
all right
the Iran protests apparently the New
York Times is reporting fake news on
this
so Iran has this thing called a morality
police unit I guess they're the ones
that make sure the women are wearing
their proper headgear and stuff and they
were the the
sparking point that caused the protests
because they arrested some woman and she
died in custody I think is the story
so the protests are raging and they they
started with
you know being against the morality of
police but I think it generalized now to
the regime
so now the the protester as much about
the regime as they are about this
specific problem
so what the regime is doing
wisely
is they're saying oh oh now that it's
about the entire regime maybe we could
go back and solve that little problem
you were complaining about you know that
morality police problem let's get back
to that let's not let's not overthrow
the whole regime
let's just go back and talk to that
thing we weren't going to talk about it
before but maybe we can talk about it
now because you seem to be protesting so
much
so Iran apparently said they would sort
of reconsider or they've suggested that
they're going to put this uh this
morality police unit on pause or suspend
them the New York Times I guess reported
that like it's true
foreign
I think people were a little more wise
about Iran including the Washington Post
are reporting it as something they said
they'd do which is a big difference
something they say they'll do versus
something they'll do big difference big
difference
so we'll see how that works out
but it looks like the regime is pretty
worried about their their survival
or they wouldn't be giving up anything
would they
I mean it seems like the regime is
pretty hard-nosed about you know this
morality stuff I mean it's pretty
Central to the whole theme
I can't see that they would back down on
the morality stuff unless they genuinely
thought the entire the entire regime
could be overthrown
so we might be closer to a total
overthrow now here's the most
interesting story it's a few days old
but maybe you didn't see it
when Iran played the U.S in the World
Cup a few days ago and the U.S won
the Iranian protesters cheered the
defeat of Their Own
team
because they they viewed their team as
really being a tool of the regime not
really
a team for the people of Iran
and so they were actually chanting and
cheering America's victory over an
Iranian soccer team
did you ever think you'd see that
oh
and
um you know how the Iranians like to do
the death to chant you know death to
America death to Israel you know there's
always death to somebody everybody's
chanting death to somebody and I just
had this image in my head of the Iranian
protesters chanting death to ourselves
death to ourselves yay America
and I thought who who predicted that
like show me somebody who predicted that
the Iranian population would be chanting
death to ourselves this time
they didn't literally say that but you
know that
it was a sense of it
um
could it be
could it be that the combined actions of
you know the several Administrations
that have had this weird Hands-On
hands-off approach to Iran could it be
that it worked
could it be that the pot the young
population of Iran is so pro-american
that you're giving the even though the
the sanctions are a hard touch I think
the Iranian people came to see it as a
war against their regime and not against
them
I don't know how that could have been
better
namely any American outcome or even
Israeli outcome name me a better outcome
than the citizens protesting their own
government and being in favor of the
United States I mean at least
you know specifically in terms of the
the World Cup but you have to think that
generalizes right they're not going to
do that unless they've got some general
good feeling about the United States and
the and the Iranian protesters are
directly asking for U.S support for the
protests
so
Maybe maybe just stay in the course
putting that consistent pressure on Iran
but not going too far
could it be that it was exactly the
right play
I mean when was the last time you ever
heard me say that and could it be that
it was exactly the right play across
multiple
um
Administrations
you know both Democrat and Republican
because I don't think it hurts
to have a little uh Trump tough love
in between some democrat Administrations
I don't know it looks like it might have
been exactly the only thing that could
have got us to this place that maybe is
a better place
Maybe
never know
all right
um there's news out of China
that manufacturing orders for Chinese
manufacturers are down 40 percent
now this is widely reported
manufacturing orders down 40 percent
I'm going to call on that
yeah that sounds like and
here's why
and see if anybody anybody has the same
background
for this number one remember I've got a
degree in economics and you know an MBA
so on economic stuff I'm a little bit
better than guessing you know there's a
lot of domains in which I'm pretty much
guessing but in economics I'm not
totally guessing I've got a little bit
of insight there
and I also did a lot of financial
reporting for years in my corporate life
so you get this you get a feel about
numbers
that usually you can call on
stuff
before you know why like you could just
look at and say no
I don't know why this number is wrong
but that number isn't wrong that I mean
that number's wrong
so I saw two different numbers one is
that something like there's a 21 you
know decrease in U.S orders or something
and I would believe a 20-something
decrease in business in China that feels
about right
but if 40 collapse
If This Were true
and the manufacturing orders for all of
all of China's Manufacturing
if that were down 40 suddenly
there wouldn't be any other news
there wouldn't be any other news we
would be in a global depression
at a scale we've never seen ever
am I right is there anybody who knows
enough about economics
and you know they have enough let's say
facility with numbers
that that 40 number seems obviously
wrong
wouldn't you agree to me that seems
obviously wrong like way wrong
now my
uh so I'll make another here's another
uh very outside the
mainstream
um
outside the mainstream prediction my
prediction is just the data is wrong
that's all my prediction is the date is
wrong now apparently there are multiple
entities
who are confirming it you know it's not
just one company with data but that's
not good enough for me
that number is so obviously wrong
it's just really obviously wrong that
there's something that might be
affecting all of the reporting
I don't know what it is
but there's no way 40 is true if would
you buy the do you buy the premise that
if that number were true
the whole the whole world economy would
have collapsed by now it just can't
happen that fast
I'm
so I mean we're we're going by feel here
right we're just going by experience and
by feel
my experience and my feel is that number
can't be real
can't be I wouldn't want it to be real
like I I want us to pull out of China as
quickly as possible but that's faster
than possible in my opinion
so I don't want to go that fast I just
want to make sure it's happening
all right
um
yesterday midday
I was already commenting to friends that
yea was being too quiet
and I didn't think we could go a day
without
some new controversy
well he he did not disappoint so by the
end of yesterday yay had used Instagram
to post a lengthy message in which he
said I'm sort of paraphrasing it here
but he said am I the only one this is
yay talking about Elon Musk he goes am I
the only one who thinks Elon could be
half Chinese
that's the first sentence
his first sentence am I the only one who
thinks he loved can be half Chinese
now
is he insulting China
or Chinese people
or is he compliment them let's let's
finish
all right he goes am I only the only one
who thinks Elon can be uh half Chinese
have you ever seen seen his pictures as
a child now I have not seen his pictures
as a child But
Otto does he look Chinese
which is hilarious because it's going to
make me look for his pictures as a child
you know I'm going to look for those
pictures now right I have to see it
because I you know I just have to see it
now
and
and then the year goes on take a Chinese
genius and meet them with a a
South African supermodel and we have an
Elon and then then if this wasn't bad
enough he goes they probably made 10 to
30 elons and he's the first genetic
hybrid this talk
and then he goes well let's not forget
about Obama and then he makes a Obama
joke like Obama was a hybrid as well
ah
now do you see the pattern
do you notice the pattern yet so this
was the the audio that's um from my
earlier presentation where I talked
about the pattern of yay is picking you
know whatever whatever is the most
outrageous thing you could say and then
saying it but he's also consistently
doing the following thing
he's consistently treating groups
like you can talk about them as if
they're one group without the obvious
knowledge that all the individuals are
individual
now he just did it again
and he just slipped it through because
you're thinking about Elon and you're
thinking basically you're thinking
about the accusation that Elon might be
half Chinese
but you also say to yourself wait a
minute
did he just say that
Chinese people are smarter than average
he didn't really say that
but
you know the the sort of Chinese genius
reference kindness at it kind of said it
now what do we do with the fact that
once again
he is he has created a group of people
like their one entity
you know like like the Chinese people
are extra smart
what do you do with that
[Laughter]
yeah he's basically already pushed you
past the Overton window
he he just treated an entire group of
people like they were one thing and you
didn't even notice
[Laughter]
because he's done it to such an extent
that now he can just make you think past
it and you don't even notice you don't
even notice if you don't think he's
making his point you're missing the show
he's totally making his point
that he can say whatever the he
wants as long as he's willing to pay for
it
and he's willing to pay for it with his
whole career
so as long as he's willing to pay for it
he gets to be the only person with free
speech and he's going right at it he's
going right at the third rail and he's
just standing on it and just like daring
you to question him because he's ready
for the fight
and he actually has the
he has The High Ground argument in a
weird way Leia seems completely opposite
but he is somehow
completely unexpectedly taken The High
Ground
which is if it's freedom of speech he
can say unpleasant things
if he believes him
right the nobody's ever accused him of
lying has anybody ever accused the a of
lie we just think we don't like his
opinion it's a little dangerous
but so is a lot of free speech pretty
dangerous now what did Elon say in
response to uh
you know being accused maybe accused as
even the wrong word because that's like
a biased word uh let's say the
suggestion
that he's half Chinese
well Elon
is I don't know if you've noticed he's
smart
so what did Elon say when he was accused
of being maybe accused is the wrong word
because then it sounds like I'm saying
that that's somehow a bad thing and
that's the opposite of the point
right the the point being it would be
potentially a good thing
so the the suggested he took it as a
compliment right he said I take it as a
compliment
is that the right answer
oh yes
oh yes
you know the the thing about
the thing about musk that you don't
notice here's here's more dog not
barking stuff
you know you notice you always notice
when anybody makes a mistake right
just stands out
the thing you don't notice about Musk is
how often he doesn't make a mistake
like where other people could have
easily stepped in it and he'll just Boop
just misses it that when you watch How
often he doesn't make a mistake that a
smart person could have made
that's where his Real Genius is well
that in engineering I guess but
like uh when you notice how how deftly
he handles these things like the way he
handled his ex-wife's comment with just
the little uh the little the little
weird icon it was just perfect all right
again there were a hundred ways he could
have done that wrong
but he picked the one way that wasn't
wrong
and he does that fairly consistently
all right
um
were you aware
all right how many of you know the
following facts uh tell me who owns the
New York Times go
who owns the New York Times this is a
test of general knowledge
big family some people saying a big
family somebody says Murdoch somebody
says Mexico
somebody says Carlos Sims
the answer is
not Bezos not salzburger the answer is
the richest guy in Mexico
uh Carlo Sims now does he own all of it
or like a control in interest
yeah Carlos Sims if you haven't heard of
him he's like the big billionaire one of
the richest guys in the world
and he owns it
um now that's the first question Carlos
Sims owns the New York Times okay
now I want to see if you can answer the
second question who was a famous notable
investor
who invested in Hunter Biden's
uh entities
Carlos Sims yeah same guy
so the same billionaire who owns the New
York Times
which is very friendly to Biden
it is also investing
in Hunter Biden's entities
now can you give me a fact check on that
I just saw it on social media yesterday
and other people were mocking me for not
already knowing that but somehow I
missed that that somehow would slip by
yeah and now tell me how many of you did
not know of that connection
tell me if you didn't know of the both
of the connections that that the same
person on the New York Times as invested
with a hunter
some of you knew but only a few right
and somehow that slipped by me
now
here's what um here's where you can
learn when you spend a little time
behind the curtain as I like to call it
when you see the news the news reports
what happened
generally they try a little bit to tell
you why but they don't get that right
but sometimes they can at least get
right what happened
right the part that they never report is
the personal connections and the
business connections below the hood
so if you open up the hood everything is
a different story
because you can see oh this billionaire
runs this politician
but also owns this entity
and then this politician said something
good about this entity oh now it makes
sense it's just the politician working
for their boss
right so it's a whole different picture
as soon as you know who knows who and
who's investing with who and all that
stuff completely different everything
you think you know about the news it's
all wrong
because of that
because you don't know who knows who and
who's who just had coffee with who and
who's talking about starting a business
with whom and all that who's married to
him yeah marriages marriages are a big
part of it
uh Wall Street Journal to its credit uh
did report on the hunter laptop story
both before the election
credit all right
Wall Street Journal
give them a little little sitting
Ovation credit where credit is due
uh we spend a lot of time on this live
stream mocking the news organizations
but in this case the Wall Street Journal
got the correct story at the correct
time they were not Bamboozled and they
did not try to fool the country
so good on them that that my my highest
praise for just doing the job they're
supposed to do and now
open up the hood all right oh wait
what's under the hood
Murdoch yeah so it's really a story
about one guy
right it's not really a story about The
Wall Street Journal it's a story about
one guy who allowed his publication to
write that story
that's about basically what happened but
to his credit he did allow real news to
come out so that that was a service to
the country
um and here's something that the Wall
Street Journal reported so this is the
editorial board and they said we now
know and no is the key word
so this is the Wall Street Journal
saying we know this we're not gassing
we now know that the Clapper Brennan
claims were themselves disinformation
and that the laptop was genuine and not
part of Russian operation CFS CBS News
recently waddled waddled in two years
later with a forensic analysis of its
own and concluded it is real now I would
like to give a second sitting ovation
to the uh to the board at uh Wall Street
Journal for using the word waddled in
the sentence
CBS News recently waddled in two years
okay that was the right word now
let me give you a little writing tip uh
this is in my mind because I was just
writing this tip somewhere else in in my
upcoming book
one of one of the filters I use for
writing
is that if I'm writing a humor piece
first I'll write it just to say what I
want to say and then I'll go back and
I'll change the words into the funny
versions
so here you can see instead of instead
of CBS News recent recently you know
entered the conversation
waddled would be the the word that you
put in if you're trying to make that
funny
now here's the second part if you're not
writing a humor piece and this was not a
humor piece
use just one
in like a in like maybe the page just
one funny word
that sticks out like waddled
will will make your brain spend a whole
bunch more time on their point
so that one word
bought them
40 percent more attention
one word and so that's my writing tip
for you if it's if you're writing humor
go back and look for all the funny words
you could replace with your ordinary
words if you're writing for a serious
point one good waddle you know one good
interesting word
can really put a little uh flavor on a
good point without detracting it into
humor so very good tip there and uh and
also by the way if you'd like to become
a better writer you should read good
writers The Wall Street Journal is very
famous very famous damn it
they're famous get rid of the ferry
The Wall Street Journal is famous for
good writing
if you want to learn how to write well
read the Wall Street journals
all right
um
but here's my question
how do Clapper and Brennan ever show
their face in public again
now that the Twitter files Revelations
have come out
how do they ever appear in public again
now everything they did as far as I know
is legal right
because lying to the public is legal
you know it would be too too much of a
problem to arrest everybody who lied so
you can't really have a law like that
so it was probably completely legal
but can you think of any examples where
the things that would be legal for every
citizen except somebody who maybe had
some job
that's a thing right aren't there
examples where
uh you know something is legal for me
but maybe it wouldn't be legal for
um an ex person of Congress yeah what
there's talk about limiting Congress
from uh let's say doing some kind of
lobbying for a few years but that
wouldn't apply to the rest of us right
it would be a law just for a person of a
certain job
here's a law I would like
I think that if leadership not Rank and
file but if leadership
of our Intel agencies run an intentional
hoax even if they're ex leaders if
they're ex leaders too if they run an
intentional hoax
for the purpose of changing an election
outcome
that should be the death sentence
now I'm not recommending
anything happen to Clapper and Brandon
as far as I know there what they did was
legal and I'm a I'm a stickler for the
Constitution
no matter how disreputable it was no
matter how awful it was and it was as
bad as anything I've ever seen it was
legal
and and I'm gonna I'm Never Gonna Leave
that standard right if it's legal you
don't touch them
but we really need to reassess the law
let's make a law that says if something
like this happens again it's the death
sentence
because it's not like regular people
when your own Intel agencies turn on
your country that's got to be the death
penalty
right that's not that's not the
Department of Agriculture lost some
money
that's not uh the head of you know HUD
um you know expense some things you
shouldn't have expensed
this is this is the worst thing that
anybody could do because the you know
our trust in our system
is very importantly connected to trust
in our intelligence agencies you can't
separate that so having the heads not
just people who work for intelligence
but having the very heads of them run
run a hoax against the American people
that changed probably had an effect on
the election outcome that's as bad as
any kind of treason I could imagine you
know short of actual physical violence
yeah it's a violation of oath even if
they're out of office I think so let me
ask you how many of you would approve
not not retroactively that's no fair
can't you can't punish those two guys
because they followed the law
unfortunately
uh but how many would agree with making
that the death penalty if it happened
again
leadership only not not Rank and file
yeah
I mean if treason
treason instilled the death penalty
right
that hasn't changed has it
I mean if treason is the death penalty
how is this different
and to me it looks like treason now the
difference of course is that it wouldn't
be treason in favor of a foreign country
but
if it's if it's overthrowing the
election it's not that different
all right
did you know that uh there was a there
were two antifa groups that had until
recently been allowed to operate uh with
abandon on Twitter
uh one of them is the uh antifa feces
group and the other is the antifa urine
group I'm using the tactical names uh
and each of them were dedicated to her
toward getting their people to collect
their own feces and urine to uh use and
protest and throw at people and leaving
places
so so Elon Musk I guess banned them
so
so if you wondered uh what is the
purpose of antifa
um
it's a apparently to produce
um
so they're not useless you know you
think of antifa as like not part of
capitalism because what are they
producing
well they're not producing any products
they don't make any iPhones but
apparently the antifa people they do eat
food that was purchased with the work of
other people and then when that food
that was purchased with the work of
other people are put into their bodies
and they can manufacture it into a
valuable
component either antifa feces or antifa
urine and those two things are valuable
Commodities and protests as part of the
democratic process so if you thought
that antifa was worthless you're so
wrong they're like little factories for
making
for making protest materials antifa
feces now if you'd like to get like a
good jar of antifa feces for your
protest they don't have a website now
because they're off Twitter well they
probably have a website
so I think you could find them so it
makes a good gift if you're looking for
a gift for somebody in your family whose
leans left uh you're thinking ah they
have everything what they don't have
would be a big jar of antifa feces to
use at their next protest and maybe they
need that
so that's something you could do
have you has anybody noticed a more
racist getting back on Twitter
I've noticed it a little have you
like just a little but it was like I
felt like it was fleeting and hasn't
really affected my Consciousness and
said
so so what I noticed when musk first
took over
is that there were some people who were
wanted to immediately test the limits
so some racist said some racist stuff
maybe they got kicked off maybe they
didn't but maybe they got bored I don't
know it doesn't I would say My overall
Twitter experience is Kinder and gentler
what would you say
but the left might say it's because it's
people who agree with you that got back
on there
so far it so far Twitter does not set my
uh stomach on fire like it used to every
single day like I my brain would just be
on fire from something I saw on Twitter
like every day I usually do some Trump
related thing but that hasn't happened
in a long time
foreign
who has blocked more people Sam Harris
or Scott
do you think that you could embarrass me
into blocking fewer
do you think that there's something you
say here about free speech that would
that would make me want to listen to a
greater percentage of compared
to nice people who have something useful
to say
yeah there's somebody over on YouTube
who's trying to shame me into unblocking
people that I wanted to block
no I wanted to block them and and you
know that I also block my supporters
right
I block my supporters on Twitter who say
I'm finally waking up
because you're not my supporter
that's the last thing I want to hear
from you
so I do block people for saying that I
don't block them I'm locals because
they're usually joking on locals I know
you're joking
but on Twitter you're not joking so I
block those and by the way if you do
joke about it on Twitter I'm still going
to block you because I can't tell the
difference
yeah all right
um
I was looking at the Twitter terms of
service
and I was wondering specifically
about Elon musk's suspending of yay
now yay got suspended because of that
logo right they had a
it looked like the Star of David with a
Nazi logo on the inside
what do you think the logo was supposed
to represent
interpret interpret the logo in your
opinion
it was a it was a swastika okay and
anything else
so you saw you saw some violence Maybe
maybe some suggested violence
but what about the Star of David part
was that just to further insult the
Jewish Community by doing the most
offensive mashup you could possibly do
was it art some people say it's art
well
here's how I interpreted it now I'm not
saying my interpretation is correct
but
that's how art works right if you look
at Art people interpret it differently
so I'll tell you my interpretation
when I saw if you look at the larger
context of what EA is doing this the a
Nazi symbol surrounded by a Star of
David
says to me
that yea would like to bring together
the people who are least likely to ever
come together
that's what it looked like to me now you
might say Scott that's the stupidest but
that's what I but that was how I
interpreted that was actually my first
impression
my first impression was it was the
opposite of hate
it was hey
even the worst people should at least be
able to come together
and I'm going to take the two most
objectionable things at least together
they're objectionable not individually
in one case
um
and I'm going to make you think about
could the worst least likely people ever
find a way to come together
now if you say to yourself well Scott
that couldn't possibly be the message
he was sitting next to
Nick Fuentes
he's a black rapper
who has partnered with Nick Fuentes
he literally is his logo
like he's the Star of David with a not
with a swastika now
you know in a in a general sense that
the the analog the comparison there is
unfair I know but you see what I'm doing
okay so if my interpretation my
interpretation was that it was a uh
it was a very challenging way to say we
need to figure out how not to be enemies
about everything
that's what it looked like
now Elon Musk interpreted it as a sign
of hate so he took him off and so I
wondered what do they what does the
Twitter terms of service say well did
you know that the terms of service of
Twitter specifically prohibit
uh hate symbols being in your profile
did you know that
you can't put a hate symbol in your
profile
now it's not pro it's not prohibited in
your feed which makes sense because you
could put a hate image in your feed
because you're talking about it you see
you see the point that doesn't mean
you're necessarily supporting it because
other people tweeted yes the symbol and
they were not kicked off because they
were talking about it but if you put it
in your profile you're saying this is me
right I associate with a symbol so
that's banned
now Didier put his symbol in his profile
I don't think he did did he he may have
tried
no it was only in his feet
so which which Twitter terms of service
would apply to that
none
that I'm aware of
well it didn't it did it in sight
violence
because inciting violence is your
interpretation
my interpretation was it was a call to
call to Unity even with the people who
are the least likely ever to find Unity
the the number one least likely group to
find Unity
that's what I saw
so why does one person
Elon Musk why does his opinion of what a
symbol that had never existed in that
full mashup form well I guess it had
existed with the railings but that's a
different story
why does one person get to decide that's
a hey symbol where if I had been the
head of Twitter I would have said I
don't know that's ambiguous
and it's in the feed it's not in the
profile
so if it's ambiguous and it's in the
feed
in terms of service don't touch it
you say it's not ambiguous
I told you I I interpret it in a
different way
how can you argue it's not ambiguous
do you think I'm lying to you
do you think that I really didn't
interpret it that way
no I actually literally did
so you can't argue that it's not
ambiguous I just told you I have a
different view of it than you do thus
proven and ambiguous
now you can say that most people don't
see it as ambiguous and that's why musk
could ban it and everybody agreed with
them I agree with you that most people
would not see that as ambiguous I agree
with that
but it is ambiguous because I disagree
so that's fact
yeah if you buy Twitter you get to
decide the content all right so here's
my bottom line on this
if you own Twitter
you have more than one Master you have
to serve
one master is Twitter it's a company it
needs to run as a you know an entity
that can survive
but you're also a human being you're a
citizen of Earth and a citizen of this
country so you have you have a different
responsibility
that's even bigger than your own company
which is
you know to the uh the citizens
I think musk made the right
citizen decision
in other words he cited he saw something
that could be hate that most people
interpreted as hate and he took an
anti-hate stand and as a human
very good
very good
I I support Elon Musk as a human being
who took a strong and fairly rapid
stand against what looked like hate
as a human being a plus
as a protector of free speech
a little less clear
so when I said the other day that he
 up on this decision Elon
I do think it's wrong on a freedom of
speech level
how many agree with my take that he was
wrong on the freedom of speech level
number of people agree
all right
now do you think freedom of speech in
this case
should have overridden what I think is a
genuine
good intention to keep people safe
do you think freedom of speech should
have been the higher
the higher standard
okay I think reasonable people can say
yes it should be the higher student so I
respect that opinion
and I'm not going to disagree with it
but I'm going to say that I also respect
somebody who would
put Humanity above a concept
I respect anybody who would put a I just
might have I might have chosen
differently I might have
but I do respect that opinion on a human
level but I don't think it's technically
the right freedom of speech
decision
yeah now and then I would be especially
happy if someday yay clarifies what he
was up to and it turned out to be you
know an acceptable clarification and
then he was let back on
then I think the the loop would be
complete and I would be happy with
everybody's performance
I'd be happy with everybody I'd say okay
you you did what you thought you needed
to do you had good intentions we fought
it out and here we are and maybe we
learned something in the process so
that's the most optimistic thing I can
say
um
and there's not much else going on
can we get some new news
please could could we have something
else going on
well yeah did mention loving everybody
yes
but he didn't he didn't complete the
circuit and say how loving everybody
can be made compatible with the things
he's been saying and tweeting yeah he
hasn't quite done that
intentionally I think intentionally
because he would know how to do that of
course
um
someone should announce for the
presidency
how many of you think that Trump can
still win
how many of you think Trump can win
I would say that he's not demonstrating
a will to win
if he were demonstrating a will to win I
think that I would say well
you can never count them out and no
obstacle is too big and you know if he
if he survived grab him by the and
all the legal challenges and you know
two impeachments if he survived all of
that
and he still had to fight in him then I
wouldn't count him out
but
the evidence suggests he doesn't have
the the will
uh for whatever reason and I don't think
he has the Family Support either and
that probably makes a difference so I
don't think he has the will to push
through it I think he might be able to
get
the nomination but he doesn't have any
chance of winning in a general
I don't think
that's my prediction
now if he doesn't if he runs in the
primary I don't think DeSantis will run
against him
even though DeSantis could beat him in
the primary because DeSantis would be so
wounded by the fight that I don't know
it would be like a
what do you call it a pureic victory the
kind where you win but in the long run
you wish you hadn't because you got so
crippled in in the winning that you end
up dying in the long run
um
so I guess the real question is whether
Trump goes ahead and gets into the
primary
what do you think do you think Trump
will actually run in the primary all the
way through to the nomination
it would be his character to not quit
wouldn't it it would be within his
character to not quit and it would be
good for True social probably
to have so probably just for his
business interests he probably has to
play it
so I think he's gonna
get into the uh
primaries now here's another uh wild
card
we imagine Trump at full speed but when
we think of DeSantis we think of him
running his state
when you think of those two things you
think of trump winning easily right
Trump has full strength
versus mostly we've seen the governor at
full strength as just a governor
but what we haven't seen is DeSantis
going full strength at Trump
what would that look like
because I don't think anybody's ever
done a good job
of going after Trump
because the left goes after him with
hoaxes and the right says okay that's
just a hoax okay that's just fake news
okay that's just you know leaving out of
context right so when the left goes
after him you just dismiss it because
it's just silly they're usually missing
the point they're lying but if DeSantis
goes after Trump
it's going to be on solid Republican
you know argument
and that we haven't seen
we haven't seen any conservative make
the good argument against Trump
but DeSantis could I think he could
bring it home so you don't know what
kind of impact that would have
here's the other thing you don't know
what kind of advisors
DeSantis would have
because if you're looking at desantises
his native ability is very high
but you also don't know who's advising
him
right if his advisors also go up to the
presidential level you know I guess he
gets maybe even better advisors you
don't know what that turns him into
you can turn into anything
so I don't know it would be
I think it would be a disservice to the
people of Florida
if DeSantis ran because they're pretty
happy with their governor and it would
you know take him out of the job for a
long time
so
Trump's advisors have been
either bad recently or he doesn't have
any
or he's ignoring them
so we'll see
all right ladies and gentlemen is there
anything I've missed any big story this
happening that I forgot to talk about
I don't think so
the World Cup well
uh what about
uh U.S lost right
to
who do we lose to
we lost to Netherlands the Dutch yeah
uh did you watch the US play the
Netherlands
the the US looked like a high school
team playing a professional team
every time the U.S team like would have
the ball and you say oh here's the part
in soccer
where the U.S team makes these clever
passes and beats their Defender and does
something you didn't even think was
possible and then they make an attack on
the goal and then you'd watch the Dutch
just like take the ball away from them
like they weren't even playing somebody
at the same level
you saw that too right
yeah as soon as you turned it on you
said to yourself uh
these don't look like the same level at
all not at all
uh
North Carolina substations attack
so there's a story about
a bunch of power substations in North
Carolina that were attacked as if it
were some organized attack
but I don't know that that sounds more
like individuals yeah that sounds like
drunk rednecks or something that doesn't
sound like the beginning of a revolution
to me
uh
oh Kyle Rittenhouse is going viral after
asking if Twitter files will reveal any
hidden censoring against him
you think Kyle Rittenhouse was censored
or accounts talking about him
I don't know
I didn't notice it
I saw a massive
tweeting uh on his
you know in his favor you didn't see
massive pro-written house tweeting like
it was everywhere
like I I didn't see any
so I'm not saying it didn't happen
because what we know now suggests that
it did it suggests that every major
topic probably had a little bit of
that problem but I didn't notice it
oh you were you were suspended for
tweeting free Kyle no you weren't nobody
was no one was suspended for hashtag
free Kyle
that didn't happen so don't tell me that
happened because that didn't happen
um
so I'm going to tell the locals people
uh something
uh dog and tree related
after I get off of YouTube because I
can't tell you the YouTube people
I give the locals people their
subscribers so I give them the the
secret stuff that so far they have not
shared outside of locals which by the
way do you know how amazed I am
so this will Amaze you you two people
the so I've got over 6 000 subscribers
on the locals platform
and I often ask them not to tell anybody
the things that I'm telling them and so
far I don't think it's ever happened I I
can't think of one example where I told
somebody on locals you know don't tell
anybody and that it actually got on
Twitter I haven't seen it once and I'm I
am so impressed I am so impressed about
that the odds of that were just shocking
yeah and and
um
I think I have sort of the perfect size
of a subscriber base because it's still
very personal you know I see the same
characters and we interact if it were a
hundred thousand I don't think it would
be nearly as
fun
yeah six thousand is a really good
number under 10 I think I'd like to keep
it for sure
all right
um YouTube I'm gonna say goodbye and uh
Spotify and all you folks and I'll talk
to locals a little bit
