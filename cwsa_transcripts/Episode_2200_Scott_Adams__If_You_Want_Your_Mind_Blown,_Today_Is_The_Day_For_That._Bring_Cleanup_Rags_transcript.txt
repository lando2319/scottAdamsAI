dude
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
times two you might see behind me a
white board but don't be confused it's
two-way boards two white boards today
yeah I know settle down settle down do
white boards but if you'd like to
put your mind at a level that is equal
to the content you're going to see today
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
of tanker Chelsea Stein a canteen jogger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the end of the
day the thing that makes everything
better or is called the simultaneous up
it happens now go
there we go
yes everybody have an equitable morning
we will settle for nothing less
lots of stories today
I'm not sure the Zuckerberg versus musk
fight is going to happen I think
Zuckerberg is saying that musk is not
serious enough and
he doesn't want to do a practice fight
at his house and
so it looks like maybe that's off I
don't know but we'll keep an eye on it
RFK JR says that the media is hitting
him harder than Trump
he says I like this quote if I believe
this stuff that's written about me in
the papers and reported about me on the
mainstream news sites I would definitely
not vote for me I get it he said
which is totally correct if you believed
what the news said about Kennedy
uh uh you wouldn't vote for him
but I remind you how often is the news
about public figures accurate
the news about never
not even ever
there's always context left out there's
always a bias in the reporting there's
always stuff that nobody could possibly
know that matters yeah so nothing you
see about RFK Jr is going to be true if
it's in the news
at least not true completely it'll be
maybe true facts but out of context that
sort of thing
all right I have a conspiracy theory to
add to the mix do you feel like there
are enough
do you need a new conspiracy theory yeah
uh but you're going to have to help me
out on the fact checking on this because
there are so many legal cases going on
that I'm starting to get confused what's
a Biden case and what's a trump case and
which Trump case is it and is it the gun
charges or is it something else
so
uh wise I'm getting Jack Smith and wise
confused what why is
is the one who did the uh sweetheart
deal for Hunter right
is that right
what so Weiss is the one with a
sweetheart deal for Hunter now Weiss is
also the one who's been chosen as the
uh what do you call it the Special
counsel
right
so here's the sequence of events that
didn't make sense
uh so Weiss was a trump appointed
prosecutor correct give me a fact check
of that Trump appointed
right Trump appointed but then brought a
Biden related sweetheart plea deal
to the courts and it was so bad that it
was thrown away
so how do you explain that why would he
be a professional
and even a you know possibly you know
not too Lefty but why would he do
something that so obviously was
you know imperfect
I don't know the answer to this but I
would tell you what I would do in his
situation
just to give you some context
all right let's say you put me in
Weiss's situation
and my boss Garland
says you have full approval to prosecute
in any state you want and you have all
the resources you want and nobody will
bother you
and then you find out none of that's
true hypothetically
you find out that you can't actually do
whatever you want you don't have the
power and they lied to you and they did
not help you the entire time how would
you play it
would you reside
some people would
it's not what I would have done
do you know what I would do it's a
little thing called Embrace and amplify
yeah once you see it
you put me in his job and you know what
I do
I would put together the most absurd
ridiculous plea agreement
I'd make sure that all the idiots who
were trying to block me and stop me and
influence me thought it was the best
plea deal they'd ever seen
and then I would go public with it and I
would let it blow up in my face
just the way it happened
I would put together a deal so absurd
that the public would be signaled that
there's no justice going on
and that's what happened and so absurd
he couldn't guarantee that a judge would
throw it out but he had to know it was
an option
and what would happen if the judge threw
it out
while there would be a lot of
conversation and winter about what was
going on
and then
the that I think he was probably
subjected to would come to light
and what was the net result
he got more power
he got more power
now I understand the argument that oh
isn't this convenient you know just when
Congress wanted to look into things it
becomes a special counsel so that they
can't yes that is very convenient and it
might be the whole reason
could be wouldn't rule it out so maybe
the whole the whole thing is just to
keep Congress from finding out what's
going on but the other possibility
is if you put me and Weiss's job and
then then I found out I couldn't do my
job and yet it was my job to go
embarrass myself in public like I really
had
I wouldn't do it
I would not play along but I wouldn't
necessarily resign
I would stay to destroy the system
that's what I'd do
I mean I think that's just a personality
thing but if you put me in that
situation what I would do would look
exactly like what he did but my
intentions would be to blow it up and
just show how corrupt it is
now if that's what happened and then the
result of that is he got the power he
always needed in the first place
you might see something like an
interesting outcome
however today we find out that the
so-called diversion agreement where I
think they take a the classic case for a
diversion agreement as I understand it
is
that if somebody's an addict but
non-violent
sometimes you'll divert them into some
treatment and don't treat the crime like
you might have because it's a
non-violent situation
so to me this is a perfect situation for
a diversion agreement
like he is non-violent
there's not much chance you know he's
going to do that exact same gun crime of
lying on a Federal Form what is he going
to repeat that crime I don't think so
so you need some kind of you know the
justice system needs to be involved he
wouldn't like a diversion either
but it seems like the right application
and now there's some thought that the
diversion part was separate from the
plea deal
so that the at least the gun charges
would be treated in a diversiony way I
think that means he gets treatment
counseling something like that doesn't
get to keep his guns I imagine
so I think that's what the legal system
should be doing for somebody like him
but the you know the rest of the plea
deal I suppose that's a bigger question
all right um
so I'm just going to throw that out
there as this might be an embrace
Embrace and amplify it might be it looks
like it
Jordan Peterson says he's creating a new
College online
isn't that like one of the best things
you've heard lately
the Jordan Peterson is trying to create
an actual Accredited Online University
that wouldn't have all the flaws of
current education systems you know the
the wokeness and ridiculous courses and
stuff like that
um but he thinks he could get the course
of a bachelor of the cost of a
bachelor's degree down to four thousand
dollars
if it's online
now I don't think online is as good as
in person but maybe with AI it will be
fairly quickly maybe it will be because
if you had an AI to ask questions
you know in in addition to the whatever
the lecture look like and the homework
might really help
I mean we might be where online is
actually competitive and he's you know
Jordan Peterson would be exactly the
person I would hope
would be involved in this sort of thing
because he can see the whole field you
know he understands
Academia of course but he also gets the
whole psychological political
you know situation so we could put
together something that made sense
so I like that
but I would like to amplify and add to
this conversation a little bit with some
white boards that are coming up don't
get too excited oh yeah it's going to be
good it's going to be good
but I asked this question on my live
stream in my man cave last night and I'm
going to ask the same question to you in
this group
because I think it's relevant to Jordan
Peterson and his creating new colleges
online question number one
you're an employer
and you're looking for employees you've
got two candidates and they seem to be
identical one is a white candidate one
is a black candidate but on paper they
seem to have just the same background
and experience so you can't tell but
the black candidate mentions that he's
building a talent stack
and he prefers systems over goals
and you immediately recognize that he's
read my book how to filled almost
everything and still went big
who do you hire
which one do you hire
the one who read my book or the one who
didn't
well read it and is implementing it
racist says white white person and now
you would hire the black person because
the black person had
acquired a set of skills
that very clearly signal a serious
person who is very likely to do well and
you would want to work with him
so I put that out there as uh evidence
that there already is a strategy
for people to succeed but
why don't they
you know what's holding things up if we
know exactly what it would take
for any individual be they white or
black or brown or anything else
we know how to do it
why isn't it happening well that's what
the white boards are going to teach you
are you ready for this are you ready to
have your mind blown
some people on the locals platform my
community there have seen some of this
but you're going to see it all put
together in a way they haven't seen
either
so the first part you may have seen
it's a
it's an idea by a philosopher Lao Sue
he'll try to get rid of that
there we go and allowsu said many years
ago he said uh watch your thoughts
because your thoughts become words watch
your words because your words become
actions watch your actions because they
become habits habits become your
character and your character is Destiny
now I'm going to update this Lao Sue
was a very smart guy apparently but he
was smart before we discovered how to
make AI work
so there's something we have to update
on this
words and thoughts
turns out of the same thing
whoops so AI taught us the large
language models that all you have to do
is look at the pattern of words
and if you applied the right technology
to it just the word use alone would
produce intelligence
but before that we imagined we had some
kind of you know reason and thoughts and
stuff that was independent from our
words
but AI kind of put the lie to that which
is something by the way hypnotists have
known forever
hypnotists know that the words
are what are activating you
the thoughts are really word
combinations
because we think in words
right your thoughts right now your
private thoughts are in words if you
were to change those words
what would happen
well if you change the words so I'm
going to treat you words and thoughts as
one thing because AI taught us that
right so if you change your words you're
going to change your actions because
that's how you're built
that's the only way it can work
the things you do are literally based on
the frequency and combination of words
in your programmer your head your brain
so to reprogram a person from something
sub-optimal to something that they would
want
all you do is change the frequency
and arrangement of words
do you know what this is called
if you change the frequency and
arrangement of words and and what you're
doing is trying to change somebody's
actions what's what's that called
wordsmithing no
reframing yes
could be hypnosis that's exactly what
hypnosis is
hypnosis is not a lot of people if they
watch movies they think it's about the
watch this clock they think it's about
the voice of the hypnotist it's not the
voice
it's not the mannerisms although those
those are helpful parts of the process
it's actually the frequency
and the arrangement of words
that's hypnosis
that's it
that's enough to change somebody's
entire brain and their actions their
habits their character and then their
destiny
so if you could optimize the words in
your head
blah blah blah let me give you a real
concrete example the other day I was
showing this to somebody
and the person said that they they were
working on a problem they had a fear of
rejection
right there they were considering doing
something it was somebody considering an
action which would have been almost
certainly good for them right a very
obvious you know just a really obvious
thing to do that would be good for you
but couldn't get the action right
because of the fear of rejection
that ladies and gentlemen is word
poisoning you say to yourself well
there's some bad thoughts there no words
are thoughts
words and their combinations
and their frequency
is your thoughts there's no difference
once you get that
you unlock this power
until you understand that your words are
a programming language that you can
change on your own
you can't you don't have access to the
stack
right and then what I heard when I heard
the person say to me fear of rejection
I had this thought
I don't use that word for anything
anything
I'm never going to let that word in my
head
when I heard it I I like I recoiled I
recoiled the actual word hurt me
it was like I don't want that in my
head
I will never use that word
because I don't want to
stop myself from acting
do you know what I say in those
situations
this is going to be great
this would be great because keep in mind
that in all of the situations I'm
talking about mine or anybody else's
people know what they're supposed to do
am I right
don't people almost always know what
they're supposed to do it's just hard to
do it and the reason it's hard is
because you don't have your words right
if the words in your head is the word
rejection
you're not going to do this whatever it
is if the word in your head is this is
going to be great this will be excited
this will be interesting by the way
curiosity is one of the best replacement
words
if you have some negative words and you
want the easiest way to replace them
replace them with curiosity words I
wonder what's going to happen well this
will be interesting I am fascinated
about how today is going to turn out
you put those words in your head you're
going to act you put the r word in your
head I'm not even going to say it again
because it's such a damaging word
or the f word
f-a-i-l nope not when I say it's not my
vocabulary I mean that I've consciously
made sure that if it comes up it's not
about me
that's you know I'm talking about a
system failure or something like that
all right so
how many of you are sold on this as a
good way of understanding the world
just just give me a a halfway point
is this a good way to understand
what you see
right I think most of you say yes got
one now all right so now I'm gonna so
hold on to this thought that words not
thoughts
words are what unlock habits okay words
and the combination of words is the only
thing that unlocks habits not thoughts
just the words
if you don't get that you don't get
anything
right
now let's explain the world
this by the way would apply to
other people more generally but I'm
going to give you a specific problem
so we have a problem let's say you're
let's say you're a black kid and you
want to succeed in this world and you
want to do it the way everybody succeeds
the way everybody succeeds is they
imitate people who have successful
patterns
so you look for somebody who's 60 you
think and you say what are you doing to
succeed and then you try to do that
that's how everybody does it everybody
everywhere now every once in a while you
might produce a Steve Jobs right Steve
Jobs does seem magical it's like he was
inventing things that other people
copied
now I don't think he actually invented
anything but he was better at noticing
patterns so he might be you know like a
real exception where he's inventing
patterns as opposed to following them
but the rest of us follow we would
follow him right she'd say what did you
do all right let's do more of that
but because we have an industry that
tells you that well these all have
something in common the Dei the CRT the
ESG one thing they have in common is the
words
that there were slaves
their systemic racism
there's black and there's white
and that there is a oppressor class and
an oppressed class
those would be you know that's an
example of the words right so don't
think too hard about the specific words
but you would agree
that all of these ideas these Concepts
are built on words
you agree so far it's a it's a word
related set of thoughts as everything is
so these are not these are not uniquely
about words
any three-letter Concepts I put here
would also be supported by their sets of
words
these sets of words create what I call
the glass imitation ceiling
meaning that if you're a young black kid
and you're asked to imitate successful
people
you're going to be looking at the people
that you have been taught or your
oppressors
who can do that who could imitate the
repressors
I couldn't
if you said the only way you can succeed
is by imitating your oppressors or a
life of crime
I'd pick the crime
I would
I'm just being honest if you put me in
that same situation the the mental
emotional
um impact of having to imitate my
oppressor
there's just no way I'd do it
I would I would take up a life of crime
before I did that so that's the
situation you're putting black kids in
and again if anybody's new to me I'm
never talking about all black kids I'm
never talking about all white people
anything I'm never talking about all
black people anything or all anybody
anything
people are amazingly different from each
other but this is just a good conceptual
framework so here's what I think has to
be fixed
uh Black Americans have an imitation
ceiling they simply can't do the things
that other people would do but
the tools are all there
the tools are there I mentioned my book
had it failed almost everything and
still went big my new one that is also
coming out I think this week if the last
technical Parts work with the online
publishing but
those would be two examples of books
that would tell anybody how to succeed
because I've organized the words and the
books
to make that happen
the books are also hypnosis in the sense
that they're built they're built to be
persuasive as well as you know
utilitarian
how do you fix this
I'm going to tell you I have no idea I
have no idea how to fix it the only
thing I'm sure of
is that it has to be fixed by the people
who are involved which is not me
this is something that can't be fixed
from the outside no matter how good your
intentions are no matter how good your
skill is
and no matter anything it doesn't matter
how many resources you have there are
some things that have to be fixed from
the inside
and I feel like every time you put
outside pressure
on a group that's already in a say
victim and oppressor model that outside
pressure depending on who it comes from
let's say it comes from somebody like me
is it helping
I don't know I I don't have a good
argument that would say it would help
might actually make it worse
so somehow Black America needs to figure
this out
you know how do they either create
enough black successful people or
stories about them so that young black
kids have lots of role models that they
can imitate
this is the basic setup
you don't know how much your problem is
systemic racism until you deal with the
fact that people are not pursuing
individual success
because they feel like it's denied to
them or where it would be unpleasant to
copy somebody
so
that's my understanding of the world did
it help
all right give me some feedback did this
tell you did this give you a framework
that
you can at least say well I could
compare this to some other points of
view
there's a big difference in the comments
on YouTube versus all right for those
who said no
uh I guess it would be hard to ask the
question so I see more yeses than those
but I think the nose may be
um
yeah I mean I have a theory about the
nose
I think the nose are people who don't
want this to be useful
I think there are a lot of people who
just want
they want their drama
they they want their hate
you know they want their helplessness
you can get real addicted to that stuff
so
you're you're welcome to your feelings
all right Norway is going to be finding
meta
for their targeted advertising as you
know meta used to be Facebook
and uh
their entire business model and other
online models is that they can give you
an ad that's targeted just for you but
Norway says no to targeted ads sort of
on a I think it's a privacy issue
but they're going to find a hundred
thousand dollars a day
for Facebook and Instagram's business if
they keep doing it now
whatever Norway does is not going to
make or break meta
but
it makes you wonder if this is something
that could catch on
would you agree that targeted
advertisement is by definition a
violation of your privacy
feels like it I mean I understand the
argument
but you know there are lots of
situations where you're trading a little
bit of privacy for a little bit of
utility so you always have to measure
well I gave up a little privacy but I
got a lot of utility so
I don't know Norway might have the right
idea on this this one I think this one's
open for opinion but
um I'm leaning toward Norway but more
generally I don't understand how how
medicines stay in business
like have you ever seen a business in
your town
that seemed to defy economics to such a
degree that you think it must be a money
laundering situation
because they couldn't possibly stay in
business for 30 years with the business
model That You observe it's like okay
you're selling decorative
I don't know doilies and you've been in
business for 30 years and I never see
anybody in your store you're like
something else going on there I think
right
uh but that's how I feel about meta
I don't know anybody who's happy about
using it
now Instagram of course is is a monster
and what's you know WhatsApp is a
monster so they have they have sources
of revenue but the the main business
which I would say would be the the
Facebook part of old and now the the
virtual reality stuff I think those are
dead
those both feel like dead men walking to
me
I don't know how they could survive
but we'll see Zuckerberg Zucker has been
right before Zuck has been more right
than me
so if I'm being if I'm being reasonably
humble
well he's probably got a better grasp on
this than I do
you think that uh history repeats
how many how many would say this is a
fair fair statement history repeats
it now we can't repeat
care repeat here's the problem with
history repeats Which history do you
pick
suppose you were looking at history
repeats and you're looking at the news
from 2015 to today and you wanted to use
that as your model for history repeats
which version of History
would use the version that says that
President Trump was a coup planner and
insurrectionist and then you would say
well that'll happen again or would you
use the version of history that says
that was always fake news and that
nothing like that happened
they're both history
and they but they point in opposite
directions so if history repeats which
one do you pick
you see the problem
the problem is you get to pick the
history you like
is the opposite of science
if you get to pick the version of
history that supports your point it's
not because history repeats is that you
cherry-picked a little story that
probably wasn't real to begin with
because history isn't real
and then you try to generalize it now
history repeats is ridiculous but we're
you know we were brainwashed into
thinking use the thing
the only part that I would say history
repeats is the human human
motivations are always the same
so for example if you created a large
organization that with no transparency
and a lot of money is involved
what what's the likelihood that it would
eventually become corrupt 100 percent
100 so that's a that's case of history
repeating but it's within the special
case of yeah people always act the same
so instead of saying history repeats
change that in your mind to
People Are People
follow the money
follow the money will take it all I mean
follow the money gets you the whole the
whole the whole answer
it's just always going to be right
so that's better than uh history repeats
but I mentioned this because somebody
else's San Francisco in a doom Loop in
other words is it just going to keep
spiraling down into nothing and somebody
used the example of Detroit is it going
to become like Detroit when
manufacturing left and my answer is no
it's uh San Francisco is not going to go
to nothing
and neither will Maui
because Maui and San Francisco have a
lot in common
that the weather is unusually you know
good and even even though San Francisco
is like cold for California famously
foggy and stuff people like it I mean
something that people like
so
now if you have the best locations in
the world
follow the money
follow the money
the money says that you always build
along the coast
you know there's just always going to be
money for that now yeah there might be
you know some companies leave and
there's lots of disruption and stuff but
San Francisco isn't going to be
abandoned
there's just too much money involved in
that location of course it'll be rebuilt
of course it will come back
and Maui's the same nobody's going to
leave Maui you know unrecovered way too
much money in that
so yeah but Detroit
once manufacturing left Detroit who had
an interest in putting a bunch of money
into it to build it up
you still have Detroit weather
all right uh so follow the money you
don't say history repeats
so I've got a another
Theory
so you probably saw the news that
Biden's been at the beach for a few
weeks and then he was asked about Maui
and although I think he has put out an
official statement he was asked for
comment alive and he said no comment
about Maui about the fire that destroyed
Lahaina and might be the worst disaster
we've ever seen of Fire
no comment
here's my interpretation
if you were Jill Biden
and you had been either asked by others
or you decided it was time and you were
going to tell Joe that he's not going to
be president and by the way I do believe
that Jill can just tell him that does
anybody disagree
I believe that Jill has his wife has the
decision of whether he runs or not and
it's not Joe's decision and I'm not
doing the old oh the wife you know the
wife's in charge it's not that I'm not
doing the old uh
um she's always been the puppet master
I'm not doing that
I'm saying that in any copy the older
one is
need to make this decision for me
conceive it that way but in a realistic
sense
when it comes to you know the big
decisions of life
Jill's the decision maker
in my opinion that would be obvious by
this point I don't think it was obvious
uh four years ago
four years ago I think Joe was in enough
you know in enough control that it was
more like a partnership
in other words that both Jill and Joe
had to be on board which they were it
looks like and then they could go
forward but this time if Jill is not on
board that's the end of it
now if you were Jill
and it was your job to tell your husband
that he's not really going to run for
president again
how would you do it
and where would you do it and when would
you do it
you would do it right now
you would do it on his summer vacation
and when you were done
what would Joe's frame of mind be
because remember
it wouldn't be his decision it would be
his wife telling it telling him that was
the decision
and when and when he's asked about
Lahaina
after he's been told he's not going to
be the president
how does he respond
well one way he might respond is no
comment
not because he doesn't care
but because he checked out
and that his mind is entirely upon his
own situation right now which would
suggest a decision has already been made
so here's my here's my uh front running
of the news
the decision is made
by Jill
has been informed
and you'll find out probably much later
now I could be wrong
pretty easily but that's what it looks
like and I base this on pattern
recognition if you put me in this
situation you said all right your Jill
and you're gonna have to break the news
to him and he's not going to like it I
do it on his summer vacation
when he has lots of time away from the
regular work to process it
I do it when he's away from everybody
else because if he doesn't take it well
you don't want a lot of witnesses
and I would do it exactly at this time
so there's enough time for a replacement
to get in
uh without it being too embarrassing
what do you think
I think to me it is screamingly obvious
that from the here's the modeling point
if you put a political model in this
you can't see it
if it's only a political model it's a
little bit invisible if you put a
relationship model on it it's obvious
huh if you put a if you put a
relationship filter on this it's obvious
she must have told them she must have
told them in the last two weeks
that's what I think so we'll test so
this will be a good test of my
predicting
you know nothing's 100 but I feel pretty
confident about this one
um that I think the relationship filter
is screamingly obvious on this one
well we'll see and also anything could
change
all right uh it's all Ben Shapiro and
some other smart people say that the
special counsel that's been chosen
uh can't be chosen from the government
employee and that's what they did
so did they just sort of decide to
ignore the I don't know laws or statutes
or is there actually a counter argument
to this because to me it looks pretty
cut and dried you can't pick them from a
government employee he is a government
employee they did pick him
can somebody explain that to me
it's not a law it's a statute
so is it a suggestion but not a
requirement
oh they violated it before
it's a regulation not a requirement
so who can who can violate a regulation
anybody who's the Boss
I don't know so I don't know if that's a
big story or not probably not
um
[Music]
do we need to talk about the Georgia
situation and
Trump's perfect phone call
now the perfect phone call to me looks
just like the drinking bleach hoax the
fine people hoax it's entirely based on
intentional misreporting isn't it
they changed the words of what he said
and then they changed the context a
little bit if they didn't change his
words his exact words and his context it
looks completely different
so I guess that's all I would say about
it it's the same trick of taking your
amount of context
all right remember every single day I
tell you
that Rama Swami Vivek won the the news
cycle again
well here we go again
um one of one of the viral videos is a a
pansexual lgbtq reporter for some
publication
um
got the conversation or asked the vague
some questions quite politely and the
vague's answer
was so perfect and complete and off the
cuff like he wasn't reading from notes
or anything
and he talked for a while I mean so it
was a really complete tight little
package that it became viral just
because it was the best answer anybody's
ever seen to that question
imagine being so good at answering the
question
that people make you viral just because
your answer was so good you just look at
it and go how did you even do that that
was so good
right and that was just one thing he did
I mean he was rapping the other day
um
but then he also makes news by being
sort of the only one who's saying and
I'll I'll I think this is him his actual
words uh Ukrainian State Affiliated
companies multi-million dollar bribe to
the Biden family so he's he's calling it
a bribe and he's saying somewhat obvious
that this should have affected his
decisions on support for Ukraine's war
and he says it directly
which again makes news and I think it's
a perfect Fair perfectly Fair
um framing of the situation
he's not saying that there's a specific
you know any specific decision but this
this clearly would put you in a conflict
bribery looking situation which he says
is impeachable
I looks impeachable to me
I mean it looks like the most
impeachable thing of all time it's like
perfectly impeachable
what was it
um so there it is again yeah Vivek day
after day after day wins the news cycle
now how did DeSantis do in Iowa
DeSantis looks like somebody who already
decided to quit the race
right because the the other the other
people are they they still have a second
bite of the Apple because they still
have the vice presidency that's sort of
up for grabs and then you know another
chance at the presidency DeSantis is not
really
a possibility as a vice president would
you agree I don't see any way that
DeSantis would be a vice presidential
shortlist
so if DeSantis thinks he can't you know
make it to the top
he it looked like a whole lot of giving
up this week it looked like maybe he's
already decided
that you know he's just going through
the motions because he has backers and
you know they told him not to quit yet
but of course I suppose everybody's
waiting just to see if Trump escapes all
of his legal
problems
but uh I think Vivek will be the
if the if Trump went away I think Vivek
would rise to the top immediately as a
person who would get the Trump votes
right
um so Trump went after his uh judge that
he's going to have for her alleged bias
in her past statements about Trump and I
would agree that her past statements
about Trump to me
show a bias against it has anybody read
her comments because that one party she
talked about other people in January 6.
in some public statement and said that
yet Trump remains free
Now that statement is chilling
because it's a very clear statement that
she believes that he should not be a
free man
before seeing the evidence just based on
what she saw in public
now
here's the situation
so the media spent how many years like
six years seven years brainwashing the
public
mostly Democrats brainwashing Democrats
into believing that Trump is a
traitorous racist sexist
am I right
he's a traitorist racist sexist the news
has been telling everybody mostly
Democrats this for years
and then the person who is randomly
chosen
happens to be a female black immigrant
right the very groups that the news has
been telling everybody
should be the most
the most outraged that he even exists
now
as I said in my tweet if science were
real and I'm pretty sure it's not at
this point
and and the scientists were not
useless weasels
don't you think there should be some
scientist like a cognitive scientist who
should say under these specific
situations you absolutely cannot have
an immigrant black female judging Trump
now this is not a comment about her
qualifications you got to hear this
clearly I have no reason to believe
she's not a great judge no indications I
also understand the judges could have
bias but still do their job
do we agree this is not a comment about
her as a judge not about her
it's a general statement that if you put
anybody in this situation
cognitive scientists if they were not
all frauds and weasels and pieces of
would be going public and say look look
this is really a special case you've had
the most powerful brainwashing forces
brainwashing half of the country into
believing that he's this massive monster
a racist sexist immigrant and hating
person
and then you randomly pick a female
black immigrant to be his judge and the
rest of the country is supposed to watch
this and say oh that looked fair to me
no problem here
I absolutely think that you can't remove
bias from you know juries and from
judges because we're humans
and I absolutely think that even with
those biases you can still get the right
result
but that's what the bias is at like
normal levels
we're not looking at anything normal
the the Trump derangement syndrome is
very real it's been studied there's no
question that it's real and when you see
the comments of the judge about you know
he's he's still free after January 6.
you cannot imagine that this would look
like a fair trial to anybody who's
paying attention
and I think that the justicism has a
obligation to not only try to give
people a fair trial duh but to make sure
it looks like it
make sure it looks like it this doesn't
look like it
and Trump is calling it out because he's
the only one with the balls to say the
obvious it's really obvious that this is
not it's not looking Fair now again
am I saying that she she is not a
professional enough
to be fair I'm not saying that at all I
believe that her intentions in all
likelihood would be to be as Fair as
possible
I would I would assume that
but I don't think that from a scientific
basis from a scientific perspective you
could put any female black
immigrant into this specific job with a
specific case
of trump he's the exception this can't
work
this this can't work and the only reason
we've gotten this far
is because scientists are
cowards
do you think there's even one cognitive
scientist who would back this
just one
anywhere in the world do you think
there's one cognitive scientist who
would say yeah I think this is a
situation where you know as long as it's
transparent and every you know judges
are taught to be independent
so this should be fine do you think so
do you think you could get one actual
professional to say that about this now
they'd obviously say it about uh trials
in general
right in general
we do the best we can but this is not in
general this is a very specific
situation that violates every historical
precedent there's never been a president
like this
who has been the subject of massive
media brainwashing
right massive and you could prove that
the the brainwashing is even intentional
you could probably find quotes from you
know news Executives Etc that would
prove that it's not accidental is it an
actual brainwashing operation
when you saw the uh the fake laptop
story that it was Russian disinformation
when you see that 50 in in past and
current intelligence people signed a
letter
is that ordinary brainwashing
is that is that like a rank and file you
know you know all of you could do it no
no that is that is military grade
that is military grade brainwashing
that's not commercial grade commercial
grade is advertising
right right now I'm doing commercial
grade persuasion
but the the government does military
grade
that's what the laptop persuasion was
that was about the Russia collusion hoax
was that like commercial grade no that
was military grade that was absolutely
military grade how about the uh
fine people hoax
the fine people Oaks do you think that
was just commercial grade
no no that was military grade
so you're looking at military grade
brainwashing
that has clearly affected one segment of
the country more than others I would
argue both sides are being brainwashed
but in different ways right it's not
always it's not always the same level of
danger depending on the brainwashing so
for example Trump is brainwashing his
team into believing he did better than
he did but we just call that politics
and we expect that right but Trump does
a good job he actually has people very
convinced of his of his successes which
by the way he did have a lot of
successes
all right well this is completely unfair
Trump is 100 right I agree that he
should go as hard as possible at her
um in most situations I would say no but
in this specific situation
of trump and years of massive
military-grade brainwashing yes he
should go right at this as hard as he is
totally agree did I talk yesterday about
Bill Maher apparently he knows the the
fine people hoax was a hoax
so he said it on on his uh Club random
he actually said
that he doesn't like being a gas lit and
that this was obviously a made-up thing
but even though he knows the story is
fake
he still seemed to believe I don't want
to read his mind but based on what he
said he seemed to indicate that he
thought Trump actually said something
like that by his defenses you know
that it's sort of taken out of context
or something I don't know but he
actually didn't say it
like like Bill is almost there
he thinks he did say it but it was like
over interpreted or misinterpreted or
something like that you know or or no
here's what he said
I'm sorry I'm I'm botching this story
what Mara said was that Trump had so
often clarified that he disavowed Nazis
that that should be taken as more of the
truth than the one thing he said that
didn't sound good
now that's not really the argument
the real argument is he didn't ever say
it
and literally he said aggressively
clearly and immediately the opposite of
what was reported
that's really different than oh he has
said before he disavowed them so you
should take you know you should take
that as true that's that's the weakest
not quite accurate defense but at the
very least
at the least
Mar knows he's being gaslit on this
topic
that's progress
that's a little bit of progress not
nearly the entire story was reversed and
faked but it's progress
all right
um you've heard people say that the
windmills the offshore windmills are bad
for the whales and maybe some of the
other sea life
and I never knew what to think about
that but one of the things that I use as
my my BS filter
is when the science matches observation
right so we have uh in our own Community
here
we see you Erica so we we have a real
life human being that I can verify as a
real life human being
who says they've seen their 61st dead
whale on their Beach
61.
this is one person with one beach
and offshore there are apparently some
newish windmills
can you imagine any Beach that ever had
61 dead whales I don't know what the
time period is but I imagine just a few
years
yeah that doesn't look like a
coincidence does it
because I don't think there were 61 dead
whales where there are no windmills
so the so I'm going to say you know I
didn't see the whales
and I wouldn't understand the science if
I saw it
but when you've got the science and the
observation
matching like that
and then you've got Michael
schellenberger who's you know he's on
this case and he's he's basically
untangling it for you if you've got
those three things happening
schellenberger has weighed in he's done
the work he's very highly credible very
highly credible
you've got observation that's through
the roof you know if you saw three
whales with three whales
tell the story I don't know
three seems like a lot actually if I are
the three whales you know that would get
my you tell me this 61 whales
61.
I'm not going to ignore that and then
the sign seems to back it so you've got
three points of credibility here
that's unusual that's an unusually high
level of credibility now
I don't want to say it's 100 proven
because nothing in our world ever is but
wow
I wouldn't worry about this one you know
those signals are pretty glaring
all right
um
do you think that the world the the
world has more fires or fewer fires
Bjorn Lumberg
says that uh you're talking about the
reinsurers so some people are saying hey
um there must be more natural disasters
caused by climate change because the
reinsurers don't want to be in the
insurance business so they're afraid
that the climate change will be too bad
do you see anything wrong with that
argument
so the things we know is that the
insurance business the reinsurers the
insurance business is too afraid
of climate change risks
from natural disasters so that must be
pretty credible that climate change is
real
must be real because the insurance
companies are the the most realistic
players anywhere
because they don't get the the insurance
companies go out of business if they're
trying to Gaslight you they can only use
real numbers as best as they can
understand them because otherwise they
go out of business
they can't just make up
so did they just make stuff up here
let me tell you what's missing from the
story how many of you know what's
missing from the story that changes it
totally
what's missing from the story
price of Real Estate
price of real estate let's say you're in
the insurance business and somebody
builds a house on the ocean and that
house is worth half a million dollars
you say yeah I mean if something happens
to that house we can afford to
pay that half a million dollars and then
a bunch of people build on on the shore
and each of them is half a million
dollar house let's say and the insurance
company still says well that's more than
I can handle like that's a lot of houses
but what I do is I I sell my insurance
into What's called the reinsurer market
so basically you you can spread your
risk among other entities so even if all
of the homes there
when you know got taken out by a
hurricane if every one of them went
you're still okay because you you didn't
take on all the risk yourself you sold
some of the risk to other people who
shared it in the risk so everybody's
okay
so far everything's good and everybody
has insurance now
let's say that the risk of climate
change makes the risk of your house
going away your half million dollar
house goes up 30 percent
can you still get insurance
oh probably
yeah you probably could
now let's say that your half million
dollar house turns into a 20 million
dollar house
because maybe a little bit of it is
inflation but also houses are rebuilt by
even richer people who want you know
Ocean Beach
so now the insurer now the insurer says
uh I can't even Insure One house
there there's the real estate's too
expensive I can't even and even if I try
to ensure you know a bunch of houses and
try to spread that risk with the the
reinsurers it's too big it's just the
numbers are too big
so
that's always left out of the story
the price of real estate should make
Insurance impractical at some point
because they they can't charge enough
to be sure they'll get their money back
now when when insurance companies say
they're pulling out
you you haven't interpreted that to mean
they don't want to sell insurance there
right nothing like that's happening the
insurance companies that are pulling out
they totally want to sell you insurance
even no matter how big your house is
but they want you to pay a market rate
for it and there's no way you will
it's just too expensive
right so the when you see the story is
about insurers pulling out make sure
that you're also seeing the context that
the cost of real estate is so so high
that it's hard for an insurer to just
even afford losses at that scale
and then some of it you have to think it
might be uh brain brainwashing about
climate change so they may have
convinced themselves is really about
climate when it might more be about the
cost of real estate going up
all right
all right
um but there are not more fires or
catastrophes that's mostly media
all right um DARPA is developing a
screening tool to detect risk of suicide
primarily in service people because did
you know this since 2001 more than 30
000 U.S active duty members and Veterans
have died from suicide
thirty thousand
that would be uh
three-fifths the size of the Vietnam War
which was fifty thousand
wow so I'm not sure I knew how big a
problem this was you know I hear in the
news all the time that military suicides
are higher than ever you know that's
alarming
but I wasn't really aware of the scale
the the scale is way different I mean
now add the PTSD people the people who
are living a life you know maybe they
wish they were dead
that's a lot of people who are
dead like
that we don't count as victims of a war
you know and maybe that's a problem
maybe we should be able to calculate how
many people are going to commit suicide
after any military action and maybe we
should say all right this military
action is likely to you know take five
thousand lives today and thirty thousand
over the next 20 years or something like
that
foreign
but there's a interesting side element
here the tool that they're going to use
to screen for early signs of suicide is
actually a scan of your brain
so they're going to ask you questions
that would be relevant you know to the
topic of taking your life and then they
would look at your brain and see if
you're lying so for example if you if
you said hey Bob
you've been complaining a lot things
aren't going well have you ever thought
of taking your life
and then Bob says no no no
now if Bob says yes then the screening
process has already worked oh we found
one Bob just said yes he thought about
it
but if Bob says no
they can look at his brain
and they can tell if he's lying
so that would be another yes
so then Bob can get some help maybe
now on one hand I say to myself wow this
would be amazing if you could shortcut
this problem and get them the
achievement they need which as a patriot
I'm especially interested that anybody
who went to war or was any part of the
war machine they should get everything
that they
they can get
um
but the scary part is they're building a
lie detector
so instead of that the ones that are not
allowed in court you know the standard
lie detector I think you know they're
not allowed in court and the reason
they're not allowed in court is that
they're not reliable
the way a lie detector works and I
probably shouldn't give away the secret
the way a lie detector works is fooling
you into thinking it works
that's the active process the active
process is not the machine reading your
vitals the active process is the person
who uses the machine
bsing you into thinking it's going to
work
because if you think it's going to work
and then they ask you did you kill the
hobo
and you're like I'm
hooked up to this thing it's totally
gonna it's gonna get me it's gonna get
me it's good then your vitals go crazy
on the machine
and then the operator still not a
science
still not a science because you could be
going crazy for an unrelated reason you
may be afraid that you would get caught
right the real problem might be that
you're afraid of getting caught and that
elevates your vitals
so that's what you know that's just one
reason they're not allowed in court
because they're not science right so
along the not science level so let's say
that the the person knows they're lying
and and so their vitals go crazy
and then the operator says
well yeah the the machine has caught uh
deception
uh would you like to modify that
statement
and then the person's like
maybe I can say something that's not
exactly admitting it but maybe maybe I
can beat the machine and then they try
to lie a little bit more
and then the operator says okay that was
an obvious lie
let me let's say it is
uh it appears that you're sending all
the signals of lying
and then you just watch the person how
they react right so the the idea is to
convince somebody that they've been
caught lying
and then they'll maybe confess
right but if you walked in knowing that
that's how it works
if you put me in the machine
it wouldn't matter what the machine said
you know if the operator said to me oh
it's going crazy I say what would you
expect when you use something that's not
based on science
and you put my life at risk with the
machine that you know is not even
allowed in court because it's not
reliable if that thing gives you
the wrong indication you're going to go
tell people I'm guilty you think I'm
going to say here all come and and and
and put up with this pseudoscience why
don't you read my goddamn horoscope and
decide if I should be in jail
all right so that's how that's how my
lie detector would go I would attack the
lie detector guy and I would make him
defend his non-science and I'll put him
on trial and I would tell him he's a
liar
I'll say are you telling me this works
well you know there's an indication that
overtaught no does this work well you
know many people have used it in many of
you situate no
does this work
and he'd have to lie to me
so I would actually make the lie
detector guy lie to me
and I would just say look
this but it's all and this
guy's a liar
here's what he said it's on tape because
they would usually videotape the the
thing just in case so you say look I've
got him on tape lying he says this
works
we have we have a hundred years of
science that says it doesn't work and
this guy just told me it does
so you know you got a liar here you're
worried about my life this guy's uh this
guy's on video line
all right so that could be a problem if
they come up with a actual lie detector
that works unlike the current models hey
let's talk about that Ukrainian
offensive
so the name Victoria Newland
comes up in the news all the time mostly
on social media seems
and I hear all these accusations
of her what what are the accusations
that she's I don't know neocon and she
likes Wars or something
is that what we think
all right so here's something uh Glenn
Greenwald pointed out
in a tweet he said the U.S began openly
touting NATO's expansion into Ukraine in
2008 under Bush
that was when now CIA director Bill
Burns wrote his memo warning that was a
red line for all Russia not just Putin
all Russia and would trigger war in
Crimea and Don Bass
and then Greenwald West says Greenwald
says guess who was the U.S ambassador to
Nato then
Victoria Newland
so Victoria Newland was Central to the
NATO expansion in Ukraine
and then was Ambassador to Ukraine
was she ambassador to Ukraine
um
or U.N ambassador
I know so here's what I I'd know and
what I don't know what I know is her
name comes up a lot when there's
something sketchy about Ukraine or war
or Russia
um I don't have any personally I don't
have any specific accusations
is there a specific accusation where
people just think she's too Hawk hawkish
is this sort of a generally two hawkish
situation
I'm not exactly sure why she's being
blamed of
right but apparently she is a Russia
expert
which is a Russia expert
do you know what I said was the cause of
the war does anybody remember what I
said was the cause of the war
or the cause of our bad relations with
Russia in general
in my opinion
it's because we create too many Russia
experts
and the Russia experts have to do some
Russia stuff and cause some Russian
stuff to happen
so I think we're creating the people who
create the problem
because they they need to have a
narrative they need to justify their
life's work imagine if we created these
tens of thousands of Russia experts like
Victoria Newland
and then we made peace with Russia and
they became an ally
they all lose their jobs
or or they have to at least retool you
know and maybe find a way to use those
skills but
I think we're creating a system which
guarantees war with Russia and the
system is we keep making Russia experts
now I'm not sure I'm not saying we
shouldn't have Russia experts but at
some point if you've produced an
abundance of Russia experts you can
guarantee a war with Russia
let me let me put it in a different way
if we had an unusual number of
I don't know North Korea experts
do you think that more people go into
the foreign services and become Russia
experts or do more of them try to become
North Korea experts
do you know why we're not at war with
North Korea
probably because we have not created
enough North Korea experts to have
something that they need to do with
their life
probably because if you're a rush expert
at least you get to visit Russia which
could could be cool
if you're a North Korean expert you're
not even get going to get to visit the
place you're an expert at
so you know why would you even go into
that line of work honestly I think
Victoria Newland might be part of my
larger larger
framework that we create too many people
who have to make it their job to create
a war with Russia
so she just might be one of those
she has family from Russia
yeah I don't know which way that would
affect her maybe that would make her
less liking Putin
depends how they're depends how the
family was doing I guess all right
ladies and gentlemen
this completes my prepared remarks is
there a topic I missed today that is uh
vitally important to you
yeah so starseed is asking the right
questions so questions I would ask
because Victoria Newland seems important
to the understanding of the larger story
wouldn't you want to know what her
connections are
I tried Googling her
and it's just page after page of
official government stuff
that doesn't look like he's telling me
anything because the real questions are
who's she married to
right
who's she married to if she's married I
don't know if she is who is she married
to uh what associations is she a member
of
and what do those associations do
typically
um
and uh you know what has she done in the
past that might be relevant or
controversial
so there's a whole bunch I'd like to
know about her just to understand the
situation but I don't have an accusation
so I'm not accusing her of anything I'm
just saying maybe we got too many Rush
experts
all right
ladies and gentlemen I'm going to say
goodbye to you over on uh
all right so I'm getting the
anti-semitic thing over on uh YouTube I
gotta pause for a second okay
for all of you anti-Semitic people
um
while I don't condemn thought crimes
uh I don't want to see it
like you don't have to put it here
but let me let me give you this little
framework if you're anti-semitic and you
think the Jews are coordinating to take
over the world
I would like to give you a reframe on
that so I'm going to reframe some of you
anti-semites antivira anti-semitism
and it's going to happen right now right
in front of you it won't work for all of
you but I'll pick up a few of you so a
few of you I'm going to cure right now
how would things look different
if the only thing about the Jewish
Community is they put a big emphasis on
education
and you know Career Success
how would that look different from every
observation would they for example go
into industries that pay a lot and are
great jobs such as the entertainment
industry
yes would they have more control over
the industry than maybe another group
they had less less attention to
education and Career Success of course
so all you need to know is that the
Jewish Community has been super
successful as school
that's it every other observation would
look like that
so everything you think about oh there
must be some coordination and some
Jewish thing no how about it's a group
of people who put a emphasis on the
stuff that puts you in those jobs
and then they got good jobs and then you
say hey wait a minute there are too many
Jewish people in high levels of
government
how would there not be
how could that not happen there are also
lots of people from Harvard and Yale in
government jobs is it is it a Harvard
conspiracy
because there's so many Harvard people
in government now it's just an
indication that there's a certain people
who are trying to get those jobs and
they're doing the right stuff
so
the only thing I would ask you is if
you're if you've been spending too much
time online you're going to get all the
the pattern people
oh look at this pattern
oh it's funny every time there's
something bad happening why do I see so
many Jewish names in the leadership
because they have a concentration of
people who like to go to school get good
grades and get good jobs
if you can't eliminate the obvious fact
that people who try to succeed and do
all the right things do in fact succeed
there's your whole explanation
uh
I have worked and I'll give you my
personal
experience
so I've worked in mostly public
publication publishing the book World
syndication
can you imagine
how many Jewish professionals
I deal with you know as my normal work
all right it's it's saturated like most
of My Success
most of it is because I worked with
really good Jewish Executives and
professionals
who were trying to make me successful
because that's how they do their jobs
and now they're successful
but I've spent a lot of time
you know saturated in that community
I've never seen anything that looked
like a conspiracy
and I'm pretty sure I would have
like I've never seen anybody
discriminate anything against me because
I was you know not Jewish I've never
seen anybody coordinate
at all I've never heard of it I've never
even heard of anybody like oh the the
Jewish Executives got together and did
some Jewish stuff never once
do do Jewish Executives like Israel
yeah
yeah what is that a news flash or
something
would they would they say things in
public that would be supportive of
Israel and it would sound like they were
on the same team yeah
yes of course
like you're just you're looking for
conspiracies where
uh it's hard to find now let me uh so
that I don't look like I'm you know just
completely crazy to you does it look
like the uh Jewish let's say lobbying in
the United States is effective
yes
yes why why would it be effective
same reason you've got a whole
community of people who focused on
education
have really good communication skills
because that's what education gives you
also very you know
career oriented so they have good jobs
so when they talk you listen to them
because they're in the kinds of jobs
where people listen to them
and they like Israel
and so there's a whole bunch of people
who do things that you know are not bad
for the United States necessarily but
you know they have a Israel benefit to
them
it's all transparent
I mean this is transparent as you could
possibly see Israel is one of our
closest allies
and we'd probably like to keep it that
way
so
yeah so uh watch the comments and you'll
see the people who can't handle the
refrain they're they're just going to go
with the the insults to me would anybody
like to uh live out their troll like
anti-semitic uh wet dreams by saying
something shitty about me
this this would be the time to do it
yeah
uh and you're debunking what now I'm
just telling you that you're seeing
conspiracies where you should see a
group of people who are just doing the
right things for success and and
succeeding and of course they might like
Israel above average
big surprise
all right so enough on that uh YouTube
thanks for listening I'll see
