Saturday and we're going to have a good
time you're going to be so glad you're
here later when you talk about it to
your grandchildren you'll be
like I was
[Music]
there good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee Scott Adams because
that's what it is but if you'd like to
take this experience up to levels that
nobody can even understand with they're
tiny shiny human brains all you need for
that is a cover mug or glass a tanker
chal orstein a canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind see I made that sound
like a stage play joyed be now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine here
of the day thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens just about now oh
so
good so so
good well new research according to
scitech daily shows the oceans absorb
more heat than previously thought huh
let's see the climate models are good
the way they are but also they have
misdiagnosed most the heat in the
ocean do you know where most of the heat
is it's the
ocean 90% of all the Earth heat is in
the
ocean and that's the part that they got
wrong they got wrong the ocean heat part
but hey those climate models are good
they're so good yeah yeah let's make
some trillion dollar decisions oh by the
way the variable that's 90 % of it we
got that wrong but we're going to fix it
oh it'll be right next time nothing to
worry about
here meanwhile uh Israel has struck Iran
in another pretend War a pretend war is
where you make sure you don't hurt
anybody and you make sure you don't
destroy anything that's too valuable and
you make sure that whatever happens it
doesn't cause more fighting and doesn't
do anything useful
whatsoever so pretend war is
Raging oh
no I hope the pretend War doesn't extend
into a pretend nuclear
attack or something so it looks like we
don't have to worry about World War III
right away but if I were
Israel and I were looking for a time to
attack my enemies in a way that was
maybe more than other people wanted me
to I would do it the week before an
American
election so I don't know what Israel has
in
mind uh apparently they're not planning
on a decapitation strike but if they
were planning on it uh this would be the
week to do it now I don't think they're
planning on it because they've already
done their retaliatory attack in a
theatrical fake way that nobody thinks
is a military way but uh Anything Could
Happen still a week before the elections
now one of the funniest things in the
news is is that when the LA Times
decided that
uncharacteristically they would not
endorse any candidate now you thought
they're going to do what they always do
which is endorse a Democrat C Harris but
they did not and that caused at least
one of their editors to quit and who was
who was praising the editor who quit
well one of them was a a writer for the
Washington Post Jennifer
Rubin a very famous well-known political
writer and uh Jennifer ruin was uh quite
vocal on X and she was shaming people
who didn't quit because in her view if
you work for a newspaper that decides
not to endorse anybody this time well
you should just
quit did I mention that Jennifer Rubin
works for the Washington
Post and
then she had a little bad luck right
after she went public saying that it's a
you're you should be ashamed of yourself
unless you
resign should your newspaper not endorse
a candidate this
time you know where this is going right
The Washington Post her employer the
next day decided they would not endorse
a
candidate now J rubman is on record as
saying that anybody who has any
character whatsoever would resign
immediately so she resigned immediately
right right people make sense she went
public saying if you are ever in this
exact situation you're working for a
newspaper your newspaper decides not to
endorse conel Harris you
quit and and she didn't quit Glenn
Greenwald is having a wonderful time
just spanking her in public for her lack
of response lack of disavowing her own
employer and just pretending like maybe
none of it
happened am I seeing
something all
right so um here's my take on it why
would Jennifer ruin who works for the
Washington Post say that you should you
should quit your employer if your
employer doesn't do it and then then her
employer doesn't do it and she doesn't
quit why would she do that well I have a
hypothesis maybe Washington Post is who
pays her but maybe that's not her
boss you didn't see that coming did you
maybe she's paid by the Washington Post
but maybe they're not her boss
maybe her boss is what all the people
who are smarter than me say is the I
don't know deep State
CIA it's long been rumored that the
Washington Post is not exactly like a
regular newspaper but rather an entity
of the deep state in some way and that
if you thought it was a
newspaper something like the LA Times
that's more like a newspaper then you
should expect the people who work there
to like the other people who work at a
newspaper but if it's true and I'm not
smart enough to know this but if the
people who are smarter than me are
correct and the Washington Post has
never really been a real newspaper it's
been a propaganda entity then Jennifer
Rubin doesn't exactly work for the
newspaper so you shouldn't be surprised
if she doesn't resign CU she doesn't
have a problem with her
bosses you know what I mean she only has
a problem with the people who pay her
and if they're willing to keep paying
her what's the
problem all right keep an eye on
that um so Leonardo DiCaprio is endorsed
to K Harris for president and also
Beyonce showed up at her rally last
night and people were sad because
Beyonce did not sing she only talked for
four minutes because you
know if I know Beyonce is going to be
appearing I say to myself oh I hope she
talks and doesn't sing no I don't say
that but um I just have a question um
have all of Diddy's regular party guests
now have they all endorsed Harris see
Leonardo DiCaprio he was Diddy's
favorite beon say yeah uh Inner Circle
okay is there anybody who's been invited
to any of did's parties who had any
opinion other than ker as a good
president let me tell you let me tell
you nobody can be better than
that well do you think it's a
coincidence that everybody invited to a
diddy party is very Pro comml Harris is
that a
coincidence
maybe maybe could be anything's
possible all
right according to study
finds uh over 60% of the people surveyed
said that the election this year is
going to damage their mental health
60% but do you think that is evenly
distributed no gen Z 66% so 2third of
gen Z thinks they'll be mentally
disabled by the
election Millennials 64% genx
63% uh 46% say they have feelings of
anxiety 37% are stressed
out
now is this because the candidates are
so bad is that why everybody's stressed
out well not exactly no not exactly the
the reason it's so stressful is because
we have a media a business model that
makes more money if they make you more
stressed out so the more stressed out
they can make you the more money they
make basically it's like one of those
old Star Trek episodes do you remember
there'd be like the original Star Trek
there would always be some alien
entity that would be feeding on their
anger and hatred so would try to make
them angry and and hateful and they
could feed on it
somehow but that's our media the the
media wants you to make you angry and
hateful and and anxious and sad and
that's how it sucks the money or the
attention out of you and then get money
from it so of course people feel like
that but it probably has little to do
with what's actually happening and a lot
to do with how it's being handled by the
media well the Gateway pundit has uh
this question on one of their headlines
is she drunk
now imagine being running for president
and people legitimately are asking it's
not it's not just it's not just
campaigning people are legitimately
asking when she talks to the Press is
she
drunk now I ask that question a lot and
I actually it's a serious question I
actually don't know I'm not saying it
just because it would be a you know
expedient way to make her look bad and I
like the other candidate it's not that I
mean those things are true as well
but she looks drunk to me she looks
drunk now I keep asking myself if this
is some kind of confirmation bias but
the reason I don't think so is that she
doesn't always look drunk in fact most
of the time not so you know 80 90% of
the time not a not a trace of anything
that you say but there's yet another
video um that the Gateway pundit
surfaced where if you look at her she's
just got that that drunk face where it's
sort of like her face is moving before
she answers the question and then it
takes her a long windup to get into the
question
well well
I W say and then have you ever noticed
she enters the word salad but then when
she thinks she's nailed it at the end
she has that satisfied look on her face
but you real because you're not drunk
that she didn't nail it at all so it' be
like uh what what would you do about
taxes
well ah um and you know she's thinking
about to start and then she's like um
middle class it's got to be some
fairness and uh and uh trumps and
Nazi then she can s look at her face it
I nailed it nailed
it yeah so good I I feel like I might
say it again oh my God I nailed
it it it's the it's the look like she
nailed it that kills me that's also the
thing I hate about Tik Tock and
Instagram reals where the attractive
woman you know does her little act in
front of the camera but then the last
thing she does if she laughs at
herself like I'm not serious you're like
I'm beautiful I'm beautiful oh I'm so
beautiful look at my butt oh I'm so
beautiful then beautiful and then the
last
thing and then she turns it off because
it's not serious people it's not serious
oh my God does that great me when I see
it well I get the same thing from KLA
so worst case scenario is that uh that's
her natural way of acting the best case
scenario is that she's drunk a
lot so there's that um she was full mind
reader as you know the Democrats do uh
normal people would say my opponent has
this policy but I have a different
policy my policy is better in a variety
of ways let me list them that would be
what normal people would say if you're
losing and you've got absolutely no way
to win what you do is you
imagine something in the other person's
head so she said at her uh most recent
rally just imagine oh and uh I'm going
to emphasize theatrically the word
stewing so when I read her quote I want
I want you to uh watch my theatrical
rendition of how she sells it oh do she
sell it are you ready
just imagine the Oval Office in three
months it's either Donald Trump in there
stewing
stewing over his enemy's list or me
working for you checking off my to-do
list oh nail it look how clever that was
oh I I want to Fat myself on the back so
badly right now but I don't want to
because I said he was stewing and I'm
doing my to-do list it's the stew list
versus the to-do list W it just keeps
getting better I'm killing it I'm
nailing it up
here
okay let me tell you the energy I'm
getting from this Trump goes on Joe
Rogan Kam says uh Beyonce not
singing here's the energy I'm getting uh
I'd like to do my impression of trump
now this is this is my um
theatrical Just Energy impression right
this is not something that either of
them have said directly they've you know
they've been in the general territory so
here's what it feels like but it's not
what they're actually saying
Trump uh on Joe Joe Rogan I'm thinking
about replacing income taxes with
tariffs as as was done in the McKinley
era
so that's the energy I'm getting from
Trump here's the energy I'm getting from
K Harris he's putting cats and dogs and
all of his enemies in a stew a
stew a
stew that's the energy I'm getting from
her um Trump we need better border
security
Harris he's going to put you in a death
camp like Hitler he's going to put you
in a death camp
Hitler that's that's the energy I'm
getting so to me Hara sounds more like a
bitter ex-wife every day whining about
Trump only thinking about
himself where do you hear this the
most you're talking to your friend who's
in a bitter divorce and your friend says
he complet the
sentence it's your friend is female
she's talking about her bitter divorce
from her husband is a is a narcissist
that's correct yes the ex-wife always
calls the husband a narcissist and what
does the narcissist always do that's
different from other people he always
complete the
sentence is always thinking it for
himself about himself right it's all
about his selfish
needs ladies and gentlemen this is not
what politicians are supposed to be
saying this is what a bitter ex-wife
says about every husband that has ever
been left they're always a narcissist
and they're always just thinking about
themselves and that's what she's settled
on but she also has and I think her
unhappy female base must love it they're
like yeah my my ex-husband's a
narcissist too let's get them
both let's get them both
so it might work who
knows um so I have coined the term H
Mary so a Hail Mary is when a football
player the quarterback throws a last
ditch uh you know it's the last second
play into the end zone hoping just by
luck somebody on his team will catch it
and win the game in the last second
that's called a Hail Mary based on you
know the religious praying to Mary
basically but the H Mary is where you
pretend that you're seeing Hitler
everywhere but it's sort of a tough one
because you have to pretend that the
nation of Israel can't spot
Hitler so you have to pretend oh totally
Trump is a Hitler and and yes Israel
loves him so much they're naming towns
after him
but here here's the reason the entire
nation of of Israel they can't spot a
Hitler I don't know why it's weird you
think they'd be good at
it but according to
keris they're supporting a
Hitler don't even know it so I feel
sorry for Israel having gone through the
Holocaust and now so close to going
through another one and don't even
recognize the Hitler that's
Rising not only that not only does
Israel not know it but a 100 million
voters in the United States no idea no
idea they Hitler is rising as uh I think
it was chriso pointed out do you really
think a 100 million people are voting
for
Hiller is that what you really believe
that well he said half the country do do
you believe that half the country is
voting for
Hiller which by the way the more I
thought about it um remember Chris
nunu's father was famous for being
literally a
genius I assume some of that trickled
down because that's the smartest I've
ever seen anybody answer that in public
the smartest politician answer for the
Republicans is do you really think half
the country is voting for
Hitler I mean
really it's the really thing
really really you don't have to use
really if if you're implying it but
really you think half of the country
looked at this and they said oh there's
some Hitler I got to get some more of
that is that what you actually think is
happening or is it more likely that
brainwashing and hyperbole is is in the
mix I think it
is and so the H Mary play is to blame to
accuse accuse him of being Hitler sort
of a desperation attempt but it's funny
because there are some uh Democrat
candidates who are trying to tie
themselves to
Trump because they think it'll help
their chances of getting elected so
there are some Democrats Bob
Casey
um and so Senator Bob Casey and
Wisconsin senator Tammy Baldwin they're
both running ads in which they're um
overtly it's not as subtle they're
embracing uh trump-like policies and and
saying so directly
now are there two Democrat Senators who
are supporting heler or is Harris just
full of and making stuff
up well I think it's all
pathetic now compare that to
Trump who did three hours with
Rogan and by the way uh the the Harris
campaign said they were talking to Rogan
but they had a a scheduling problem
a scheduling
problem he he has an audience of 50
million people who are exactly the
audience she most wants to talk to to
convince young
men and she had a scheduling
problem is that the president you
want okay you're you're only two and a
half hours by car away from his office
he said yes he would almost certainly
you know move his schedule around yours
and it's exactly who you want to talk to
and is 50 million and it's the most
important time you could ever do
it oh I got a scheduling problem yeah
that that's the president you want to
solve all your big problems the one who
couldn't solve how to get on Joe Rogan
when he's invited her and and she's just
a short car ride away oh I couldn't
figure it out now that was a lie of
course um some people are saying that he
wouldn't agree to some
restrictions that sounds likely but I
don't know if they actually had that
conversation or if the if the Harris
campaign was just um maybe pretending
that they were interested so that later
they could say yeah we were totally
interested but something came up is
which is what they
did so Trump does three hours on Rogan
then he goes and does a whole
rally do you know what we don't talk
about
anymore remember when we used to think
the age would be an issue and that Trump
you know maybe can't keep
up he's obviously has more energy than
Harris does I mean he's clearly doing
far more than she is and when he does he
does cancellations they're strategic so
if you see Trump cancelling something
it's because something better came
up he doesn't cancel things because he's
just he was tired it's something better
came
up
so anyway so Trump goes on so you
compare the the things that Harris says
let's see she's mind reading that he's
selfish and that he's going to be
heiller so that that's her main closing
argument
literally
hallucinations now compare her literal
hallucinations to what Trump says at his
rally he goes on there he goes
uh no tax on tips no tax on overtime and
no tax on Social Security benefits and
then he asked the crowd to cheer for the
one they liked best
come
on come
on come on do you know how perfect that
is well let me explain the technique
that he wrapped into that one little
message first of all he listed three
things that are you know certainly
popular with some people no tax on tips
no tax on overtime no tax on social
security that is laundry list
persuasion which is not logic it's just
really persuasive so you hear three
things at least one of these things is
going to appeal to you right at least
one of them is going to appeal to you so
you've got something to like and then he
says cheer for the one you like
best oh my God he's getting them to
think about which one they like
best that's thinking past the sale the
sale is I've got three things for you
you know the sale is what what do you
like of the three he's already getting
you to cheer for the one you like better
the best meaning that he you've already
decided there's something on the list
you like he just wants you to Che cheer
for the one that's the best meaning that
they're all good but what's the best
that is
perfect persuasion communication but it
gets
better he combined that with asking them
to do something the do something is to
cheer for the one you like the best if
you can get your audience to do
something it doesn't matter what stand
up do the wave cheer cheer for this vote
for that raise your hand any of those
things that is really really really
really good persuasion because if you
can get somebody to move their body on
demand and then watch all the other
people move their bodies on demand in a
similar way even if they're competing
for which of the three it's a similar
way you just hypnotized
while were there 10,000 people I
mean if you were to write a book and I
have it's called wind bigley second
edition about how to do persuasion you'd
put that right in the first
chapter and that's his closing argument
he's peing he's peing his closing
argument is the sharpest cleanest most
succinct most easily understandable most
actionable most
activating most summarized most
perfect you'll ever
see I mean maybe maybe there's a a cidy
who could do better but my God my God
this is so good you know just from
persuasion I'm not even talking about
the economics just from
persuasion uh I mean you can't get
better than
that all right um but comell Harris is
not nearly asle clear As Trump is uh
however she has some good news too she's
been asked to be on the cover of a major
magazine you may have heard it it's
called vague so it should be on the
cover of vague no it's not vogue vogue
is a different thing Vogue is more about
fashion uh vague is more about not being
able to explain your
policies cover a vague magazine yep dad
joke that's your dad joke for the day
well are you ready for some maybe really
big
news it's possible that you woke up this
morning and you did not
hear that some news was made in the
courts or possibly you heard it but you
didn't know its
importance you ready for this this is a
big one if you haven't heard it yet get
ready for some good news all
right the fifth Circuit Court just ruled
that ballots must be received by
election
day
period and any state that says you can
count those ballots after election day
if they've been received after election
day is violating federal
law
and now this is specific to three
states uh Mississippi Louisiana and
Texas however
since it's the uh fifth Circuit Court it
will certainly influence all the states
because every state that's thinking that
they want to do this is going to look at
the Court's opinion and say oh
 all it takes is one lawyer to say
um
hey hey uh fifth circuit and we've got
to we've got to conform because we know
that if we take it to the court the
court will say the same damn thing they
said last time we just told you we told
you it was true for three states did you
think we were going to say the other the
other states are fine do do you think we
were only talking about three states
we're the fifth circuit no if we say
three states can't do it because it's
illegal it's illegal everywhere right so
there's that you know tiny bit of
technicality to it but in a practical
sense the ability to cheat by including
uh things that came in after the
date may have been taken
away now there's still some you know
maybe some ways that you could gain that
system for example they didn't say you
couldn't count after election day they
said you couldn't receive and and
include in the account the certain
things that came in after but is anybody
going to really know when it came in
is there a way to just keep counting and
say it's going to take us four days to
count them all and then they're still
trickling in and then they just count
them
all and then somebody says but you're
not allowed to count them all and they'd
say I don't even know what you're
talking about well we think you counted
ones that came in late really well no we
didn't no we're pretty sure that you
counted once that came in late really
take it to court all right we will so
they take it to court and what's the
court say say you don't have any
standing or the court says how many do
you think they did and and you say well
we don't have time to audited it but we
think they did but do you do you have
evidence that it would have changed the
outcome well not not evidence because I
don't know how many I mean maybe and
then the court will say maybe so you
don't have standing and you don't have a
claim that it would have changed the
election get out of here so don't be too
happy about it before you see how it
could actually play out in the real
world because remember we don't have a
system that can catch and correct an
election
mistake mistake as in
rigging so that's the most important
thing you need to know if you if you
believe that we have a system that can
catch and correct mistakes in our
elections you're in a whole different
world that you know all of your
assumptions are wrong we don't have
anything that can do that it is designed
so you can't do it it's designed so the
courts largely don't have to determine
who the winner is which you know has an
appeal so Trump goes on Rogan for three
hours and one of the things he uh as I
noted he did float that idea of tariffs
instead of income tax I don't
believe there's really a chance that
that can happen and only because it
would be such a big change and we
wouldn't know how much money we'd be
getting and uh your products would all
go up um by tremendous amount you'd
still be paying your taxes it's just
that when you bought a piece of gum it
would cost
$112 so so you're going to say to
yourself he's taking away my income
taxes I love this until you buy a piece
of gum and it's $12 and you go oh I get
it you just inflated all of my all the
prices for all my goods so I pay the
taxes that way well at least you'd have
the option of not buying
things but that's not ideal so I don't
think that's going to happen I love the
fact that that he's you know even at his
current age I love the fact that Trump
would think of a brand new
entrepreneurial out ofth boox idea and
just loaded out there I like that part
the fact that he's mentally flexible
uh I love the part where uh Joe Rogan
called out all the hoaxes so Rogan
called out by name the very fine people
hoax the Russia gate and then I think
Trump added the the blood bath you know
there's going to be a blood bath for
hoaxes now so so Rogan actually said
quote the very fine people hoax the
Russia gay hoax all these things you
tried to pin on you it's a it's a clear
distortion
how do you think I feel about
that let let me read that sentence again
and then for those of you who have been
with me a
while you tell me how I feel about this
Joe Rogan potentially 50 million maybe
more maybe a 100 million people are
going to hear it and he says to Trump
with nobody chatting over him plenty of
time to hear
it as clear as day the very fine people
hoax the Russia gay hoax and then Trump
threw in the the uh the bloodbath
hoax my work is
done my work is done seven
years of pushing the the the public to
understand that the fine people hoax was
a hoax now of course other people work
very hard on this too with Steve Cortez
and uh you know he he he wrote a fine
piece on that uh Joel poock um has been
all over it since the start and the
three of us you know have have made sure
we stay in touch whenever we we hit on
it so that we can all three hit it at
the same
time and all I wanted to do was to make
it common
knowledge and I wanted people people to
refer to the Fine people's situation
with the word hoax and I wanted somebody
to be able to say the phrase find people
hoax and have enough people listening to
it know what that means where it didn't
need to be
explained it didn't need to be explained
people Joe Rogan called it the fine
people hoax and nobody needed to have
that
explained he used the word hoax he
didn't just say they lied about what you
said he didn't just say they edited it
he called it a hoax the fine people
hoax this is everything I was trying to
do and then he landed it a week before
election and he put it in front of 50
million
men and the men who don't know that that
was a HX or that they lived in a hoax
ocracy just found out from one of the
most in credible people in the United
States Joe
Rogan do you think that's
persuasive yes that's a 10 that's a 10
out of 10 that's exactly the Right
audience in exactly the right frame of
mind a week before the
election it's exactly the right two
people Joe Rogan and Trump because Rogan
is the sort of the height of credibility
in terms of you know he's not lying to
you he could be wrong like maybe maybe
you like some you know specific uh you
know conspiracy theories that you don't
like but he says that clearly too you
know he tells you what he's doing it
recreationally and when he's doing it
seriously so the most credible person to
the most important demographic which is
young men and people are going to watch
that show just laid it sound like a
fact we're done discussing it it's a
fact it's the fine people
hoax and if you don't mind I'm going to
take a Victory lap because when you work
that
hard to get something done that's this
big and it
lands I feel
great I just feel great today so
Joel and
uh Steve
Cortez good work good work
guys and to all of you who have been
forwarding it and boosting it all these
years good work to you appreciate
it all right meanwhile in the hill I I
did a little test to see if people could
find uh the brainwashing part in
that
um so here's something in an article by
Brett samels
um now if you're writing for the hill
and you're one of the writers is it fair
to assume that you're probably college
educated it's kind of rare for a famous
writer to not be college educated Matt
Walsh is probably the you maybe the best
writer I know who's not technically
college
educated
um but here's something that uh that was
said by Brett Samuels talking about
Trump um
Trump said on Joe Rogan about the 2020
election he didn't get into it deeply
but what Trump said is uh quote what I'd
rather do is uh we'll do it another time
I would bring in papers that you would
not believe in other words evidence of
of riging in 2020 allegedly according to
Trump and then this is what Brad Samuels
the writer in the hill he summarizes it
this way he says uh the election was so
crooked Trump said at one point
repeating the false claim that he did
not lose in
2020 the false claim that he did not
lose now remember the claim is not not
that the system didn't pick Biden he's
not arguing that he's arguing that if
the system had looked at the votes
correctly and counted them correctly and
and without any rigging that he would
have won now of course Brett Samuels
understands that context
but BR anels
interjects that he did not lose in
2020 does he really not know that that's
unknowable you can't know who won we
don't have a system that produces that
kind of information not even close in
fact it's designed so you couldn't
possibly know who won the election you
know what the official numbers are but
you don't know anything that went went
into it what's behind it you don't know
if it anything was faked you don't know
if anything was
hacked so what would make this Highly
Educated writer say something that's so
obviously so obviously not true I mean
like super glaringly incredibly
obviously not true because everybody
who's got a college education knows that
everything that has technology and it
can get
hacked right if I gave you a quiz and
said hey do you think everything
important can be
hacked they would all say yes for
example there's a story that uh Trump
and Vance's cell phones have been hacked
by
China did you hear that that's brand new
news so if China can get into Trump and
Vance's cell
phone and China can get into as
Christopher race as maybe our entire
infrastructure
does Brett Samuels think that our
election systems are
impenetrable of course
not like why would you why would you say
it in public when when if anybody asked
you that question you'd say of course
not everything digital is
penetrat the I mean just look at the
fact that when
Iran uh Iran's nuclear program was taken
down by a a cyber
attack what could have more Security on
it than your nuclear facilities
especially if they're secret nuclear
facilities and somehow Israel penetrated
that so if you think election systems
are the one impenetrable
thing where' you learn that which
college told you
that all right I'm going to go deeper on
that
um but first so Mark cubin has this this
fascinating position so he's supporting
Harris but he is very much against her
idea of an unrealized gained on uh
unrealized gains tax where you get tax
just because your assets increased in
value and uh Cubans take on that is it
would be terrible for the economy it
would destroy the economy but don't
worry because she's definitely not going
to do do
it her campaign begs to difference to
differ and they say oh she's definitely
going to do that so imagine being her
you know one of her main
supporters and and in order to support
her you have to say out loud in public
multiple times no she's not she's not
going to do that thing that's right at
the top of her list of most important
things she's going to
do now is that
fair is it fair to say that don't worry
about that it's not going to happen
totally don't worry about that it's not
going to happen because she can't do it
herself and there's no way that the
Congress is ever going to agree to it
there's not even any chance there is
zero chance that Congress would approve
that so yeah he's
right but he's also supporting somebody
who's saying something that's clearly a
lie she's not going to do
that now you might remember that I did
something very similar
in 2016 when Trump was saying I'm going
to deport every single illegal alien and
people would ask me Scott how can you be
in favor of that there' be people who
have been living here as Americans for
you know decades and you know they're
here with their kids they've had
children in America they pay their taxes
how in the world are you in favor of you
know deporting them and I would say he's
not going to do
it and people would say it's his number
one thing
it's the it's the main thing he talks
about and I would say he's not going to
do that it's hyperbole he's going to
deport as many people as he needs to to
get the you know the criminals and and
the ones who are the most problem out
and when you get the criminals out the
public is going to say uh now we're
thinking about other things so he never
really needed to deport 20 million
people or whatever the number was then
he needed to close the border enough
which he did he needed to deport the
worst people enough of them which he did
and then America being the reasonable
place it is said oh okay well it doesn't
look like it's the end of the world now
so yeah okay some of us wish you'd
deported more but you know it's not
bothering me at the moment and I've got
somebody to mow my lawn and somebody's
picking the fruit and all right we could
live with it now that made sense that
was just hyperbole but there's no I
don't think there's a
hyperbole way to say you're going ATT
tax unrealized gains that's sort of
binary because there's no amount of
taxing of un unrealized gains that's
okay not any amount that's completely
wrong whereas some amount of deporting
clearly made sense some other amount
made less
sense anyway so that's
happening
um Trump also said he'd released the uh
JFK files and I love this the statement
he said uh quote um I can't tell you
whether this is what Trump said to roken
I can't tell you whether or not they're
going to find anything of Interest
meaning in the JFK files but I was asked
not to do it and I thought that was a
reasonable ask but now I'm going to do
it I'm going to do it very soon Trump
said do you know what that means
so let's put this together and see if
you can predict what happens
next so the files
exist Trump wanted to release them
somebody presumably the CIA said bad
idea could you please not release these
Trump maybe not knowing everything
that's in there possibly said all right
okay that's reasonable I won't release
them now he says he will and and I
suspect he might so now put it Forward
what happens
next well one possibility is they
assassinate
him like
JFK because that would solve the
problem and that's probably what the the
files say is that the CIA killed JFK
probably don't know for
sure but
probably but here's what's more likely
because if they assassinate him it's too
on the nose if they assassinate him
there's going to be violence right the
the public is not going to take that
laying
down let me be as clear as I can I don't
recommend
this but if Trump gets taken out by our
own people a week before the election or
you know even before getting sworn in or
anytime after um the guns are coming out
right I don't I'm not recommending
it but let's be honest if they take Trum
out Trump out the guns are coming out I
don't know what'll happen I don't have a
prediction but the guns are coming out
so just think about that again not
recommending it you know if you take
your gun out you're probably going to be
dead or in jail so highly not
recommended
but it's just a fact you that that would
be a level that you at least a third of
Republicans would say well that's a line
the line was very clear we could not
have been more clear where the line was
we didn't have to say it out loud but we
couldn't be more clear where the line is
so the CIA knows
that they they know it be too big risk
so what's going to happen game it out
let me tell you what's going to happen
those JFK files are going to be
accidentally
deleted now you might say are you
 kidding me there's no way they
can just accidentally delete them yes
they
can why do you think you haven't seen
the Epstein files why do you think
you'll never see the Diddy tapes why do
you think uh Hillary Clinton could uh
what was it uh White washer clean washer
files and throw them away why is it that
the uh why is that there some ballots
that we can't look at that are behind
the locked
door it's all the same the the Democrats
have a very long history of literally
just saying oops I lost it I was sure it
was behind this door oh oh There were
files oh we recorded over the files so
I'm going to make this prediction for
the first
time Trump will try to re re release the
JFK
files you're not going to see the JFK
files they're going to be
deleted and I'm not even sure it's the
wrong thing to do because whatever is in
there is really
bad and I'm sure it's not too far from
what we assume is true right so we're
we're acting as if we're assuming we
know what it is anyway but uh no you're
never going to see the JF files they're
going to disappear or you're going to
get some files and you're going to know
things are still redacted or still
unavailable and that will be the good
stuff but even if Trump says give me
every one of those files you're not
going to see
them because obviously whatever whatever
is at stake is just too big too
big well uh there's a a writer for the
Atlantic George
Packer um George
Packer wonder what his middle name
is George
Packer I don't know what his middle name
is but it could be something funny
anyway he writes for the Atlantic which
is a propaganda Outlet pretending to be
something else and uh he claims that
Black and Hispanic voters are shifting
toward Trump but uh that's not the real
story it's not about race it's more
about education and that uh
the fact that the Black and Hispanic
voters on average are lower uh have
lower educational accomplishment than
other groups uh that's why they're
moving so it's not about their color or
identity it's that uh Trump only
attracts the
uneducated so that's what an educated
person wants you to
know well and he said quote he says the
sharpest divide in our politics today is
education whether you have a college
degree degree or not uh that's the
likeliest determinant of whether you
like Trump or
Harris well I pity the highly educated
in America because they are also the
most brainwashed all right so here's the
hypnotist filter on that opinion as a
hypnotist I can tell you the following
is true for
sure uh highly educated and smart people
are really easy to
hypnotize uneducated people can be h
too but there's a little bit of a
difference in how they operate for
example if the government says something
that's ridiculous on the surface what do
uneducated people say about it they go
well that looks like a lie because it's
absurd on the surface and they figure
the government usually lies and they can
get away with it so why wouldn't they do
it again so the so the so-called
uneducated people get the right answer
almost every time because the government
is lying to you almost every time even
when the thing they want to do is good
for you they still have to lie to you to
sell it right maybe the infrastructure
thing was good but if you call it a I
don't know saving the green new world or
something you can get people to say yes
so even when it's good for you they lie
to you so when the uneducated people
hear something from the government they
automatically say well that's another a
lie I don't know what's true but that's
probably not true and then they really
really have a good track record of being
right now let's compare that to a highly
educated person who's getting their news
from The New York Times Ah that's some
smart stuff there that's some oh you you
read the New York Times you're you're
reading smart stuff written by smart
people and you're getting all that smart
stuff into your smart head wow you're so
smart and then you cross check it with
some other things because you know you
don't want to rely on One Source
educated don't do that the educated will
look for multiple sources so in addition
to the New York Times they might go to
let's say the
Atlantic yeah and then they might go to
let's say the Washington
Post and then they turn on the TV and
they look at
MSNBC and they say I pity those
uneducated people oh my God they're so
darn dumb they don't know that the
election was
fine in which I say oh wait a minute the
dumb people according to you the the
uneducated people they know that every
digital system can be hacked and they've
never heard an argument for why you have
digital systems in the first place if
they're slower more expensive and less
credible what do all the educated people
say ah I read the New York Times and the
Washington Post in the Atlantic and they
all say the elections were
perfect so I'm glad I'm an educated
person because I get all the right
answers I hate to be like those
uneducated people hey how about those
vaccinations how about those masks
listen to science people listen to
science oh I think I'll go out and
measure accurately the temperature of
the
planet because I read in the New York
Times and the Washington Post on the
Atlantic that you can do that and they
get an accurate
answer no there there is a structural
reason why the educated people know the
least there's a like a a design reason
our system is designed that if you're
educated what do you get more
of
brainwashing you get more of it and and
if you think that if your view of the
world is that the smart people are
living in this world with lots of
brainwashing but they but they have this
little force field of smartness around
them so so all the bullshit's bouncing
off oh that's not happening no now if
you're living in a complete immersion of
brainwashing you're
brainwashed so the so-called uneducated
simply by paying less attention to the
the sources of of brainwashing they're
not reading the New York Times they're
not reading the Atlantic they're less
brainwashed so on the big stuff they're
more often
right and they're right because the
brainwashers are always lying even when
they're trying to do what they think
might be a good thing they're still
lying
so
um a a highly educated voter would say
something like uh thank goodness our
election systems are never hacked the
way the uh phones were hacked for Vance
and Trump that's what the educated
people would say thank goodness the only
thing that never gets hacked is our
voting systems the uneducated say oh it
looks like everything gets hacked who's
right the
uneducated of course they're
right of course they're right it's not
about IQ it's not about IQ it's not
about
education it's about how much
brainwashing you you absorbed the more
you absorbed the Dumber you got and the
educated absorbed the most by far
because they don't they don't even know
that their sources are
brainwashing so you might ask me Scott
but what about all those exceptions
because there are in fact educated
people who support Trump to which I say
there's a reason for
that it's because the
hypnotists got him man at the
brainwashing when you when you listen to
the people who have gone over to Trump
listen to how they
talk uh Bill Amman says this I believe
the fine people
hoax and as soon as I found out what
they did with did to me with that that
it was just a bad at
it then then that opened him up to all
the other brainwashing and then it was
easy for him to say oh my God yeah
Trump's the obvious choice how about uh
Elon
Musk he knows which things are
hoaxes how does he know well he heard it
from people who knew he looked at what
they said looked at the original stuff
and realized oh the people who say it's
a hoax all
right right how about the Allin pod guys
you know three out of four
anyway I don't know their I don't know
their transition story but I'll bet at
one point there was somebody who was a
hypnotist who had surfaced something as
a
hoax and then it came to their attention
huh is this a hoax people say this might
be a hoax then they look into it sure
enough it's a hoax and then they're run
hypnotized and then all the other
brainwashing becomes um part of their
part of their vision
so this of course is the hypnotist view
of the
world but my my belief is that the
intelligent people on the political
right have a set of
hypnotists actually literally chain
trained hypnotists who are a little bit
more immune from brainwashing because
they can see the gears of the machine
like you can see it coming at you so you
could go oh that's one of those things
it's easier to avoid the brainwashing
when you see all the mechanism if you
think you're watching the news well then
you fall forward pretty quickly but but
if you can say oh you're doing the
laundry list uh you're doing the thing
where you're making us uh act at the
same time you're doing the social proof
thing and you're doing the making me
think past the sale nice job that's
that's a good job and that's there's no
brainwashing there because you see all
the
mechanism now I've
trained a lot of you to now see the
mechanism and I bet all of you would say
yeah I can see it now you know not every
time maybe you're not all experts but
you see it more often than not um I
think that the biggest story of why
smart people are coming to the political
right
is the hoax uh the people calling out
the
hoaxes and and so again I would also
call out Mike cernovich Jack babic you
know you could come up with I'm sure uh
you could come up with 10 more names of
people who are calling out the hoaxes
but a lot of that came from hypnotists
first it's just you wouldn't necessarily
be aware of
that
anyway um here's a recreational Claim
about the
election all right so beware of the
Krakens
so a kraken or also as we've learned uh
the Buffalo Run is a play in which if
you're trying to hide something and the
other side is on to you you feed them a
fake story to ruin their credibility so
when they start talking about the real
one the people go ah you lied the last
time so look out for the bad guys giving
you fake election rigging
stories that you talk about and then you
find out oh they made that up and then
you're done but here's one that uh I
don't know what to think about it so I'm
going to create it I'm G to say it's a
recreational belief meaning I don't know
that this is true but it sounds really
cool and it goes like this this is one
you've heard before but it's just so
interesting so Drome Cory is writing
about this in the American
Thinker that there's a a PhD Andrew
pette who looked into U I think it was
the New
York New York New Jersey Ohio Wisconsin
Pennsylvania some other states and he
examined their uh their voter
registration
databases and he discovered he says an
algorithm and I don't know how well I'll
I'll describe this but he says he can
see the
code and so I mean he's just looking at
it he he's not
speculating his claim is I'm looking
right at it and and this code would do
the following things now remember this
is a recreational
claim if if I were to put in odds of it
you know checking out and being in
context perfectly low but that would be
true of all the big election claims any
of them
individually I don't know probably not
but overall it's a system that
guarantees is is rigged I think you just
don't you won't necessarily know how but
our current system guarantees rigging
because it's not auditable fully anyway
so here's what he
claims that they've got an algorithm
which would allow them to add false
voters to the voter roles now normally
that wouldn't be a problem because if
they're false voters they would be
called in the normal process of getting
rid of Voters who have moved or died or
things like that but they put a bunch of
false ones on there and then the
algorithm
allegedly uh covertly tags them for easy
retrieval later so that would be
something that allegedly he could see in
the code that they're treated special
and that uh they can the false
registrant meaning the fake people on
the voter roles can then request absenc
ballot absentee ballots because the
system thinks they're real because
they're on the voter roles but they're
really being sent to fake people who are
going to fill them out then the fake
ones are gathered and they fill them out
as Central
places and then the uh false voter
records are updated to reflect the false
votes and then after certification the
false voter records are manipulated to
disguise their purpose and
history so the claim is that you can
look at the code and it's the same in
all in these several States not all the
states but several States and that you
could just look at the code and you
could see it's obviously for the purpose
of rigging
election now the reason that I don't say
this is proven this is true we got them
is because it's probably the 10th time
I've heard a story that sounds like this
with different details but oh we
found the truck full of ballots but we
lost it
you know it's going to be like that so
I'm not sure I believe this one but it's
out there so sharing it with you the
larger picture is if we don't know if
that's true or false how do you know if
anything else is true or false about the
election so ladies and gentlemen those
are my comments for today a wonderful
day of news it's been and uh I'd like to
talk now to the private wonderful people
