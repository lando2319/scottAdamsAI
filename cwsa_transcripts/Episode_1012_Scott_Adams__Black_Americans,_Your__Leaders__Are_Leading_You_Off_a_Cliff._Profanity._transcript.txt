I'm pom pom pom pom pom pom yes you're
surprised to see me at this time of day
but I had a message that has some
timeliness element to it so I thought
I'd jump in here and and deliver it a
way for a few of you to come online
before I get going this may be the last
day you ever see me because the odds of
me being canceled forever in the next 10
minutes are pretty high I listen to a
little bit of charlemagne and that will
be part of what I wanted to talk about
alright so the title of my periscope
today as I said I was going to give some
advice to black Americans now it's not
really advice and I don't believe an
advice per se and the reason is you can
give people information and they can
make their own in their own decisions
and certainly it would be presumptuous
to make advice for some community you
are not a part of so when I say advice
you should just see it as context maybe
some new information maybe something
that you hadn't considered before but
don't take it as presumptuous because
it's not really advice you're gonna do
whatever you need to do I'm just gonna
tell you some things that maybe you had
not considered it goes like this and by
the way I warned you that there would be
some profanity right there's going to be
some profanity so if you've got any kids
in the room probably want to probably
want to get him out of the room so let
me start with the good news
Martin Luther King was really good at
this stuff
you remember his I had a dream speech
how perfect that is because it takes
your mind to the future you can
visualize it a you know dream where
everybody is treated fairly and it was
also accurate because it wasn't true
that things were good at the time but it
was true that everybody dreamed of a
time when it would be better so not only
was his message
perfectly appropriate to how people were
thinking in other words it is fit what
they were already trying to think we're
thinking both white and black everybody
was thinking well I'd like to get to a
time when it's all working so I I point
that out because he was an unusually
effective leader but also his persuasion
technique if you're looking at the
actual tools of persuasion very very
good not only did he match conservatives
by being as religious as they were took
the high ground didn't use violence I
mean basically persuasion wise he was
excellent but that brings us to today
and we don't really have a Martin Luther
King who's in the arena at least not one
I've noticed and let me say this as
starkly as I can and by the way if you'd
like some context I've been complaining
about president Trump's let's say
leadership in the last few days on this
on the protests and the riots so this
will not be directed strictly at the
african-american community because it's
just as true for Trump but your leaders
are incompetent your leaders are
incompetent that's the problem
the problem is not really anything else
it's not anything else if you had good
leadership you could identify and work
toward fixing problems that would get
you everything you need you don't have
that you don't have anything like that
and here is what your I guess it comes
off as leadership whoever is leading
black lives matter especially here's
what they're doing wrong have you ever
heard the phrase selling past the close
it's one of the most famous sayings and
persuasion and it refers to the fact
that let's say you're a salesperson
you're trying to sell somebody on a
product you get them to say yes and they
take out their wallet
selling past the clothes is when you
keep selling after they said yes because
there's nothing good that can happen
after that because you've already made
the sale the only thing that can happen
if you keep talking is you lose the sale
it's one of the most basic and strongest
persuasion recommendations in the world
don't talk past the sale the sale is
done take the money take the money what
happened when everybody saw the video of
George Floyd the sale was concluded that
was the sale the sale was white America
do you understand how bad this is and
most avoid America probably didn't
probably didn't understand it then we
saw the video the sale was made you made
the sale what did you do after the sale
you protested no problem with that
protesting make sure everybody hears it
make sure you reinforce it peaceful
protest excellent good idea a good way
to reinforce the sale that you've
already made make sure some action
actually happens maybe a good time to
come up with some specific
recommendations do you know what would
be the dumbest thing you could
do the dumbest thing you could
do after you've made the sale a riot set
on fire the of the people who agree
with you set it on fire and then oh it
gets better
and then you're incompetent
leaders who I'd love to help literally
literally I'd like to help if I can help
let me know
but you're incompetent leaders
have once again decided that their best
play tonight
Monday night is to have the protests
again which will bring the Lunars again
which will bring anti-fog again what are
you going to be watching on social media
all night tonight you're gonna be
watching young black men and women
commit crimes all night so all night I'm
going to be watching black
people commit crimes
you incompetent leaders why are
you doing this to your people
why do you hate black people you
black leaders because you're you're
leading them right off the cliff
let me say this as clearly as possible
if there are riots tonight and it's
planned by black lives matter to have a
peaceful protest I get that part I know
the plan is for peaceful but you
know what's gonna happen you know what's
gonna happen if you do it again tonight
now that you know I'm out I'm out I will
never do anything productive for the
black community again period done will I
ever hire a black person well in public
I have to say yes don't I but black
employment is done after tonight
now if it stops tonight I think we can
recover like if tonight goes well
because I think the police are getting
smarter there there may be joining in
with the protesters you've seen some
examples of that honestly the best thing
the police could do is March with the
protesters think about the best thing
the police could do is actually just
break up and March with the protesters
why because then there would be a
policeman or a police woman right where
the looters are the looters and the
police would be in the same place and
then maybe they could do something or
the police could say to the peaceful
people
hey those looters see way you can do try
to talk them out of it just otherwise I
have to arrest them I'm standing right
here their looting right in front of me
can you guys talk them out of this
my help so tonight might go well it
might maybe a little trouble maybe maybe
we figure out how to do this but if
we're watching more pictures of black
people setting on fire breaking
 windows you're losing you're
losing hard you're going right off the
 cliff I want to help you I want
to I want to help white people want to
help you've made the sale you
made the sale stop it up
who are your leaders let me tell you who
your leaders are and I'm not sure this
is anybody's fault it's sort of a
default situation if you don't have a
you know a real leader you end up
following a podcaster right it's
probably bad enough you listen to me but
you might know that rush limbaugh
again trying to help what is lish what
is rush limbaugh trying to do today
trying to help because he saw
the video he says this is terrible how
can I help
rush limbaugh goes and seeks out the the
best qualified voices to speak for the
black community so he's got you know
somebody who can speak with some weight
he finds Charlamagne tha God and has a
polite discussion with him which could
have been great think about it and that
could have been quite a moment rush
limbaugh Charlamagne the great same side
same side all they had to do is find out
what the two of them could do to move
the ball forward so what happened
instead rush limbaugh asked shall they
mean the god what can be done what
practical things can be done what what
real practical things can be done what
did Charlamagne tha God say to the
question about what real things can be
done he said that you have to I'm
paraphrasing but this is pretty close
you have to dismantle the entire system
of white supremacy that's it
you have to you have to dismantle the
entire system of white supremacy
Sharla being the god where's that button
is there is there a lever that I pull
because that's a little nonspecific it's
 worthless
it's worthless it's just words
there might be true words I'm not even
saying if they're true or false they're
 worthless we're having riots
shit's burning people are getting killed
and Charlamagne the great the person
that the black community at least some
of them have turned to for some kind of
a leadership voice the best he can
 do is dismantle the entire
system of white supremacy yeah where do
you start where do you start is it
hiding under my couch do i do i do i
vacuum under my couch do i kill somebody
do i put somebody in jail do i change a
law what does it mean useless
useless useless oh my god here's
what you should be doing now I'll take
this out of here here's what you
could be doing you should and advice are
obnoxious words so I'm not gonna give
advice and I'm not gonna say should I'll
take those words back because people
have to make their own decisions what to
do but here's the here's the information
I will give you if you want to make the
sale make things better change some
things the President of the United
States is waiting he's just waiting give
him an idea what happened when somebody
took to the president the United States
the idea of prison reform he did it he
did it he did it because it was a
specific idea there was well thought out
you know eventually they they figured
out how to do it and then he signed it
what better time would there be to come
up with three to five specific
suggestions
take him to the president and say we
don't know if these are the final things
but these are the ones we want to focus
on maybe work through it do a little
more research you know do a test maybe
but how about these five things where
are your five things you got you
got you know like a million people
marching in the street does anybody have
a typewriter typewriter dating myself
its ass everybody have a keyboard or a
 pencil to write something down
you got some ideas write them
down we'll take a look at them I will
take a look and I will sell your idea
for you in fact if you can't find a
 black leader who wasn't
completely incompetent and obviously you
haven't because everything that's
happened in the last few days is nothing
but incompetence and by the way I'd say
the same thing about our government at
the moment so it's not about black
people
it's is we have this weird leaderless
situation who is the leader of Anti Fog
mostly white people right who is the
leader no no I have no idea they don't
have a leader right they're a leaderless
organization well so are the Democrats
and so are the Republicans at the moment
the whole country is leaderless
if you need one uh happy to help I mean
I don't want to be the leader but I
happen to help if you can find somebody
who can bring some specific suggestions
to the president I'll even go further I
will guarantee that if you can give me
three to five you know well thought-out
ideas even even if they need some work I
guarantee it will get to the White House
guaranteed there's not even the
slightest chance that won't happen all
right so if you want to be helpful
you've got a clear path you've got
you've got a clear highway where
everybody's agreeing they just need some
specifics
just give them some specifics something
to wrestle with something to work on all
right but if instead of that your
leaders have decided to walk you off the
 cliff by having yet another
night of nothing but video of black
people committing crime
because that's what's coming don't
expect any help in the future
right just speaking for myself but one
imagines that there are other people
having similar feelings I've offered a
lot I've taken a lot of
from the right for even having a
conversation with black lives matter all
right
how much did I get for just sitting
down and talking to you no Hawk Newsom
from black lives matter and see if we
can figure out something that would be
useful it turns out that Hawk Newsom was
 useless because he didn't want
to he didn't want anything that was
useful in the end he just liked the
issue so he was addicted to the issue he
was not committed to any kind of
solutions at least that's my opinion
after working with him but I took the
chance I took the personal risk of
working with black lives matter to try
to help because I thought I could there
was no interest in solutions that I
could find really couldn't couldn't find
any interest in solutions and in fact
that was somewhat confirmed by my
interaction there you know I heard from
some behind-the-scenes stuff that the
worst thing that could happen is a
solution right because they need the
issue not the not the solution so let me
say it as clearly as possible tonight's
the last night tonight's the last night
if burns up tonight if windows are
broken tonight I don't care if I empty
Phi held the hammer if black lives
matter organized protests anti-fog shows
up with a hammer I'm out and and I don't
know if I could get back in but if you
want to walk off the cliff tonight's the
night so let's see how
incompetent your leaders are tonight see
if you follow them walk right off the
 cliff go ahead because this is
this is the biggest mistake the black
community has ever made by far by far
nothing's even close
so I wanted to do that give that little
bit of context that I won't call advice
because that's presumptuous you really
need to know how white people think if
that's who you're trying to persuade and
I believe that's the problem right you
are trying to persuade white people
you're not trying to persuade yourself
if you want to persuade white people I
just told you how stop selling past the
clothes give us some suggestions we're
ready all right I'm just repeating
myself now I'll leave it at that I'll
probably be canceled in an hour and I
will talk to you well I don't know if
I'll ever talk to you again
