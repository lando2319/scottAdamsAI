better too
yeah didn't see that coming
sneaks up on you that's how they get you
savor it savor it okay now we can go on
dr funk juice good to see you
um i'm in a good mood today
for no particular reason
do you ever have that happen i think
it's just a good night's sleep
you get a good night's sleep and
suddenly the world is a wonderful place
even when it isn't
let's talk about all the news such that
it is
uh elon musk tweeted today
that uh the most entertaining outcome is
the most likely
the most entertaining outcome is the
most likely
now i wasn't sure if he was he was
pairing that tweet
to an earlier tweet of his own in which
he said that
he'd invited kanye to talk within the
clubhouse
app it's an app where you could have
audio conversations
and uh so he may have been referring to
that specifically but
somebody somebody noted the similarity
in our thinking
now is the similarity in our thinking
because one of us influenced the other
or is it because we are both uh let's
say
uh interested in i won't say believers
but uh interested in the simulation
theory
because if we are a software simulation
there might actually be a reason the
most entertaining outcome is the one
that happens
because in other words we might be some
you know multiplayer game in which
interesting elements are introduced
intentionally
either by an ai or by a game designer i
guess
so there's an interesting question
somebody says is elon musk a hypnotist
well let me let me point out the
following
uh elon musk was originally part of the
paypal
founders that included reed hoffman
and um why am i forgetting there for a
second uh
the other trump supporting billionaire
whose name i'm just forgetting for a
moment
but you notice that uh there was a
surprising number uh yeah peter thiel
sorry
uh peter thiel there were a few others
but those are three famous ones who went
on from there to
larger fortunes let me tell you
those three people have a very deep
talent stacks and
i i can say from personal contact
at least in two cases that they just
understand more more topics than other
people
and part of what some of them understand
i would think all three of them
is the is the topic of persuasion
and they do all seem to understand it i
think reid hoffman
was one of the maybe the person who came
up with
the scheme for uh suggesting friends on
social networks
you know how where you know if you have
some friends
you'll suggest other friends and there's
some other techniques like that
so if you look at the success of a lot
of their products
the the psychology is built in
when elon musk builds into his uh
his cars the ability to have uh
what is it like a poison gas protection
mode or something
he's replacing the need for
advertisement
by simply being interesting now how many
people are smart enough to do that
but consistently to just get rid of
advertisement
but to consistently just be interesting
so people can't stop talking about you
you don't need advertising then
well he does that right and you see him
doing it across his whole line
so when you see the various things that
at least three of the founders of the
paypal
situation you see what they can do
and you see that they bring the skill
set to different areas and they just
keep succeeding
over and over again it's not an accident
it's not an accident it's partly because
their
skill stack is so deep it includes
understanding the psychology of
situations
so i would not say that he was a
hypnotist per se but his
skill set definitely overlaps with
psychology
and if you've got somebody who has an
engineering brain
think about this if you have an
engineering brain
which musk presumably was just born with
and developed
over time and then you add to that
the understanding of psychology and what
motivates people
you can be a billionaire too you know
do you know the reason i'm not a
billionaire
because i'm not an engineer if i were
also an engineer
instead of just somebody who talks about
them i feel like i'd probably be a
billionaire
because if you combine you know high
level engineering that
the kind of creative entrepreneurial
type that that a musk or a
teal or reed hoffman have if if you
if you take that skill set you combine
it with understanding
people you're done
you're done that pretty much covered the
whole freaking
world so it's not an accident that
somebody like
musk succeeds you just look at his
talent stack and say well yeah
how are you going to hold that back
so i would say that it is
it is likely that people who believe in
the simulation
and what i say believe i just mean the
statistical
understanding that it's a trillion to
unlikely there were a simulation
but you can't know for sure um at least
we can't know yet
for sure i think we will i do believe
that there will come a time
when we can develop a a test or a
scientific
uh way to look into it and we'll
actually know
if we're a simulation i think that's
ahead of us
like literally we will know because
we'll figure out a clever way to
to test it um
so that's that um
you know i said on twitter today that
most of what passes as politics these
days
is little more than well-dressed people
misinterpreting what the other side said
and a lot of people came in and said
willfully
the other side is intentionally
willfully misinterpreting what the other
side said
and i'm here to tell you that that's an
illusion
i used to believe it myself i used to
see you know one political side saying
something that was obviously a lie
and i'd say to myself well they know
they're lying they're doing it for
effect
but they know they're lying i don't
think so anymore
clearly in some cases
clearly in some cases they are lying but
the more i spend time with people who
are genuinely arguing their case
the more it's obvious to me that the
difference in news
coverage you know who sees what news
completely determines your opinion
so the people who only watch cnn they do
believe cnn when it says that the fine
people
hoax was real why wouldn't they
if the only news you had seen said that
the find people hoax was real and you
saw all these credible looking people
saying it and saying it every day for
two years
and it's all you saw would you be lying
when you repeated it
you wouldn't be you wouldn't be lying at
all you would actually freaking believe
it happened
all the people who were telling who
believe the the the drinking
bleach hoax or the injecting
disinfectants oaks
all the people who believe that really
happened believe it because their entire
news
universe covered it like it happened
they treated it like it was a real thing
that happened
why wouldn't they believe it so
this is a big deal in terms of your your
understanding of the world you live in
those people that you think are
willfully lying to you
and intentionally telling you an untruth
they're not some are yeah i'm not gonna
there's no absolutely here right some
are
but not ninety percent i'll bet you a
solid at least 90 literally believe
the things they're saying literally
and in fact you could put a gun to their
head and say look
all right i i've got a magic gun that
will go off
if you're lying they would stick with it
at the risk of their own life i do
believe that they believe the things
they're saying
most some not but most
all right um and by the way if you were
not a trained hypnotist it would be hard
for you to get to that place
you you would you would still think well
it's still
obvious it's a lie isn't it obvious you
don't even need another news source
to know that the president did not call
neo-nazis fine people
you don't need a news source to tell you
that didn't happen
right common sense would tell you that
didn't happen but it's so easy for
people to buy into their team's
uh narrative that i do believe they
believe it
mostly um here's just a throwaway
thought that i like to
inject into the universe every now and
then
there are a number of things that we
argue over politically
that we don't need to and i would argue
that immigration
is one of those weird uh weird issues
where the way we're
approaching it is super um
disruptive and uh you know it makes us
fight with each other about where
immigration should be and what's
what's right and who's really the nazi
yeah and all the crazy stuff
but what if what if let's say i'm
president
the day i become president and people
say what is your immigration policy
i say i'll figure that out here we're
going to use a system and the system is
going to be this i'm going to get the
smartest people
bipartisan economists and i want them to
tell us what measures we should look at
in the economy or crime or maybe drugs
etc
uh which measures should we look at to
decide
how much immigration to let in in any
given year and from what countries
why don't we just have a set of rules
this says if the
the gdp is over four percent
which would be really good then you let
in a little bit
more workers because you're going to
need workers if the gdp falls
or unemployment reaches a certain rate
you cut it back
because you don't want to be competing
with your internal workers
what if i'm president and i present you
with that proposition
and say look let's let's take you and i
out of this
why am i arguing with you when neither
of us really know the right answer
do you know the right number of people
to let him to make the economy
better versus the versus too many
do you know that how would you know that
how would you possibly know
what is the right number of immigrants
to let in you don't know that
i don't know that so pretending that we
know the right number
is just like a stupid argument it's just
two stupid people who don't know
anything arguing with each other
with their stupidity nobody knows the
right number
but if we got this bipartisan group
together
and they said look under these
conditions you let in more
under these conditions you led in fewer
under these conditions you let in
let's say more people with technical
degrees from
india and other countries under these
conditions you let in more workers
it should be fairly objective now the
people who come up with these standards
could easily be wrong that's how
economic things are right they're not
usually
that good economic projections and you
know any kinds of
triggers and stuff like that they're
always going to be really gross
but at least it would keep us from
fighting with each other
wouldn't it be better if we were all
just fighting with the algorithm
and saying hey i don't think you should
be four percent
maybe you should take that down to three
and a half
that would be that would be a far more
unifying
argument to have so why am i arguing
with
another citizen when we should be on the
same side
right we should be on the same side we
should be arguing about the process we
shouldn't be arguing about the people
as soon as you're arguing about me
you're on the wrong topic
let's figure out a process a system that
works
like as a at least as rational even if
it's not perfect
if i ran for president i would do it
without telling you what my policies are
and i would win here's how i'd do it
i would tell you what system i would use
to arrive at my decisions
and that's all i would tell you i
wouldn't tell you what the decision will
be
i might you know predict what i think it
will be
but i won't tell you what it will be
i'll tell you that the way i'll deal
with it
is i'll bring in the people on both
sides
i will publicize it i will actually
broadcast
my conversation with both sides
we'll have some iteration where i've got
some questions and they have to come
back to me with some answers
and when it's all done i'll i will
present
both arguments as president
i will present the argument that i
disagree with as well as i can
first first so i would present
first the argument i disagree with and i
would do the best job i could
of genuinely selling it and then i would
say
we understand why people think of this
because it's pretty strong argument
then i would say the full argument for
the other side let's say the side i've
agreed to back and i would say
this is a good argument too and when i
compare these two good arguments
i i feel that this one has a little more
value
here's why we can't know which is better
because it's a complicated world and
predicting things is crazy
but we can know this one has some
qualities that we're looking for as a
country perhaps or maybe some
risk management qualities that we would
all appreciate
i'm pretty sure i could get elected
president without telling you what any
of the decisions would be
because the moment i tell you what the
decision will be you should stop
trusting me
immediately because between the time
that i say this is what i would do
and the time that i could get elected
and do anything about it there could be
a lot new information
i might find out things that i didn't
know i might become president and get
the secret information and
you know the home the homeland security
information i didn't know before and
changed my mind
so i'd rather tell you here's my process
i'm going to try to follow the
constitution got some basic
basic rules of you know what is fair and
right for the world but basically i'm
going to let people argue it out in
public
and i'm gonna i'm going to give full
attention
to the minority argument or the argument
that's not going to win
full attention yeah you have to give
them complete attention
otherwise you're not credible
that's what most of our politicians are
doing wrong today
the the best political way to
sell something is to sell the the other
side's argument
first that makes you look credible
if you can explain the other side's
argument as well as they explain it and
even better it would be better
right if you can explain the other
side's argument as well as they can
explain it
and then you tell why your argument
might be a little bit better than that
well at least you're credible at least
right you're not trying to just be a
manipulative
you know dick which is pretty much every
politician at this point all right
so that's all fantasy because i know
that's going to happen
we're learning now that president trump
was way sicker with the coronavirus than
we thought they were actually thinking
about putting him on a ventilator
which as you know is usually the end of
the road
meaning that once you're on the
ventilator you don't come back
and he was close to that they say what
do you make of the fact that we didn't
know that
what do you make of the fact that the
white house apparently was lying to us
about the severity of our leader's
condition
what do you make about that somebody
says is it true yeah that's the first
question the first question is is it
true
can you believe it yeah you know that
it's the right question but there's
there are some specifics to it that make
it sound
real uh i i'm completely
on board with all of you who say you
can't trust this automatically
so don't trust it automatically it could
be fake news
but my my detector tells me
it's not and my detector is
telling me that the details are a little
too detailed uh and it's a medical thing
it just doesn't feel like the kind of
thing that they would lie about
and if they did you probably would have
already heard the other side saying no
that's not true
he never had it was never that bad so
there seems to be a lack of any pushback
although the president's not in office
so he doesn't have an official pushback
machine
but it looks true enough to me
if i had to bet on it i bet it's true
now if it is true is that an impeachable
offense
because i don't recall that pence was
ever put in charge
and how how coherent was
president trump when he had uh 80
percent
where or his oxygen was in the 80s near
death
or near high risk of death so
i feel as if almost everything that
they're going after
trump for to uh to impeach him
is not nearly as bad as things we know
he did
or if this is true we know he did it
i feel like the public needed to know
this
and i feel like this is really bad if
it's true
again i can't assume it's true but if
it's true it's really bad
the other part of the story that makes
me interesting interested is that
they tried hard to get the regeneron
drug and
it looks like maybe it worked in his
case trump thought it worked
but where are we on regenerons do we
know that works now
is that is that randomized controlled
trials have proven it works
and are we making enough of it and who
makes it i have lots of questions about
regeneron because
does it work do we know that
why aren't we making more of it if it
works so well
so your news is failing you on a pretty
big point
there um
here's something that is bugging the
 anime today
there's something that's just bugging me
a lot today
just a lot and i can't say it's
necessarily
important i mean it might be it might be
important
and it's this
jamie raskin senator raskin
brought up the fine people hoax and sold
it as if it really happened you know the
idea that
trump had actually said that the
neo-nazis and racists were fine people
now if you watch any of my content or
you're associated with
any content on the right you know that
that's debunked you know that the hoax
is caused by
cutting off the part where he where he
clarifies he's not talking about them
without any prompting trump clarifies
i'm not talking about the neo-nazis
and the you know the other races so they
just cut that part out
and then it makes it look like the
opposite like he was talking about them
um so so raskin brings that up
and i say to myself if the trump
legal team doesn't start
by debunking that simply by showing the
part that they left out
if they don't start by debunking that
they're worthless and they shouldn't be
paid honestly
if trump hired lawyers who don't go
after this
the single biggest hoax used as a
you know a foundational point in the
entire defense
if they just gloss over that
if they just act like oh well that's
what you say now here's what we say
about something else
if they let that stand
they should not be paid seriously they
should not be paid
you know trump always gets uh
gets a lot of heat for not paying
subcontractors and some of his lawyers
thought they wouldn't get paid
but i don't hate the fact that there's
somebody out there who doesn't pay for
bad work
i don't hate that have you ever had any
work done on your house
was it all great was it all terrific
all the subcontractors your plumbers
your electric they all did great work
right
and but they probably got paid no matter
how good their work was
if trump being a builder who needs to
you know make a profit if it was his
habit not to pay people who did bad work
i just like that some people exist to do
that because i can't personally do it
i'm still going to pay for the bad work
right because i just don't need the
trouble
but i don't hate it if that's his habit
now of course you don't know if that's
why he's not paying you know you wonder
if he's just being selfish or he's just
getting away with it because he can
who knows so i don't have any details on
this but
um i do think that people who don't do
the job
should not be paid and if they if they
let this go
i would say number one that trump
deserves to be
impeached not in a legal sense
but if he leaves trump's supporters
exposed
on this hoax if he lets the world who
now has to pay attention because it's an
impeachment trial
they can't just skip it cnn can't turn
it off
you get you get how good this is cnn
can't really change the channel now if
trump's lawyers say we're gonna make you
watch the entire
find people hoax video for the first
time
they can't cut the commercial because
that would make it a bigger story
and if they sit there and let you watch
it the entire country is going to find
out
that one of the most basic things i
believed about trump
never happened now
if trump allows his lawyers to skip this
then trump right he's leaving us
exposed at
us being anybody who ever said anything
good about him for four years
so let me say this again as clearly as i
can
trump owes his base
doesn't he and nobody would argue with
that right
trump's base supported him
even when things were tough trump owes
his base
a similar consideration and his base
is very exposed right now because that
fine people hoax hangs out there
like like this cloud over all of our
heads
as if we somehow supported a president
who had supported neo-nazis
that didn't happen we didn't support a
president who supported neo-nazis
we supported the president who condemned
them in clear voice
without any prompting that's what we
supported
now if he can if he tells his lawyers
look i don't care if i win or lose this
thing
but you're going to fix that
thing that's all i'm going to ask of you
i don't care if i get impeached and
removed probably not going to run for
office anyway
but you've got to fix that thing
that's all i'm going to ask of you
because you got to do it for him
you have to do it for trump but you have
to do it for us
all right it's not just about trump the
rest of us are on trial
us being again anybody who ever said
anything good about trump
we're all on trial and if these
lawyers
let this opportunity go by and they
don't debunk this thing in front of a
captured audience of the public they
are worthless and should not be
paid
should not be paid if they let that go
now um i tweeted just before i got on
that if i were defending the president
even not as a lawyer
just me i could win his case
from the starting position that his
lawyers have today
in fact it would be hard to lose
because all i would do is say all right
let me tell you for the first time
you've ever heard this
how the left has manipulated information
and created hoaxes and one by one
i would debunk each of the popular
hoaxes about this president
but here's how i would start the first
hoax i debunked
would be a biden hoax why
well i told you earlier in this live
stream if you can't
describe the other side's argument
then you're not credible you have to be
able to describe the other side
and biden was the subject of a hoax
perpetrated mostly by the news on the
right
that he had once recently said that
signing eos is what a dictator does
and then he signed a bunch of eos he
never said that
he said that a certain type of thing you
couldn't do with an eo
and that you would be a dictator if you
tried but that there were other things
that of course you could do
eos about and he did so that's an
example of
complete fake news about biden and i
would start with that
i would literally defend biden against
one of his
you know more aggressive claims against
him
and then i would say look how the right
believed that
because their news source told them it
was true
and they did believe it right and then i
would say
this same technique has been used
against president trump for four years
let's run through some examples i would
show the fine people hoax i would show
the drinking bleach hoax
i would show the feeding the overfeeding
the goldfish hoax
i would show the covington kids hoax
and i would show the brand new
swalwell hoax swalwell showed a tweet
as part of his argument against the
president uh yesterday he showed a tweet
from a woman who said
that if i believe she said if trump
wanted they would quote
bring the cavalry swalwell presented
that
as cavalry meaning military meaning
violence
it turns out that cavalry is a prayer
group
that's right the woman whose tweet was
mentioned
said um we're a prayer group
we were saying that we'll bring our
prayer
all right so i would show the world
the swalwell i just made this up and
showed it and a context
and that that's how all of the hoaxes
are created
they're all created by removing context
and likewise the impeachment of the
president is made
by removing context specifically the
context of
do it peacefully and then they're doing
another trick that i don't know
i guess i don't know enough of the
history of this trick to know whether
legally this makes sense as a legal
strategy but they're doing what i call
the
the tapestry approach to blaming the
president for inciting violence
and the tapestry approach says this
there was no
one thing he did it's really a whole
bunch of things he did
that you would maybe think are unrelated
but once you've looked at them you know
together as a presentation
they form a tapestry of incitement to
violence
which guarantee the capital assault was
going to happen
so that's the case that they're making
to which i say
is that a thing is the tapestry approach
to inciting violence when did that
become a
credible legitimate argument
because i don't think it is is it
i mean in in what world is it the
accumulation of unrelated events
which caused a specific incitement at
this point
and we ignore all other variables like
all the other variables that caused
the capital assault to happen we just
ignore all of them
it's just trump here's what i say
ask yourself this number one would
would there have been an assault on the
capital if
we have a credible news industry
well here's what would have happened if
we had a credible
news industry they would have reported
hey it looks like this election was fair
enough and that we've done audits where
we can
and there's no specific claims that we
can
try trace down that look like uh there's
real so we the
respected and credible news
organizations
think that it's time to move on and just
have a biden administration
suppose the news had been
not fake news and aggressively fake news
for the last four years
would the people who assaulted the
capital
have believed the election was fixed
which is what they believed or would
they have said oh man
everybody in the news is telling me it
was fair enough
i guess maybe it was do you think that
this could have happened
in a world in which the news was trying
to be fair
because i don't think cnn was trying to
be fair
i really they weren't trying msnbc
they're not really trying to be unbiased
so um let me give you
a little flashback to years ago i took a
test called the gmats now the gmat is a
test you take to see if you can be
qualified to get into a business school
to get your mba one of the questions
that was on the test or types of
questions
that they've now removed and they've
removed it for a good reason
and i'll tell you why they would give
you a scenario a little story of a
business person who had a problem
and then they would say what is his
biggest
problem in other words what does he need
to solve
to make whatever he wants to work work
and there would be several things in the
list and i would look at the list and
i'd
pick one and then i'd look at the answer
guide because i was practicing and i'd
get it wrong
and i think i think the answer guide is
wrong
because it's my opinion against theirs
just my opinion my opinion is that this
was the most important thing
the answer guide said it was something
else with no explanation
now here was my argument if
in order to solve the problem you needed
both
things to be solved it wasn't
one big problem if you solved it then
everything else would take care of
itself
it wasn't like that there were multiple
things that every one of them had to be
solved
for the solution now if you need
all of them to be solved or you don't
have anything
which one's the important one right
none of them another none of them is the
important one
they're all equally important because
they're they all have to be solved one
hundred percent or you can't do anything
so that kind of question got thrown out
uh on the the gmats uh
because they were just subjective it was
obvious after a point that you could
just argue about what was the important
one
and and nobody would know the difference
and then i was going to tie that back to
an earlier point which i don't remember
at all
so in your minds if you can remember
what i was talking about just before i
started to talk about the gmats
figure out a way that that made sense
with whatever the hell i was talking
about
and now imagine that i was coherent
because i'm not right now okay
thank you for the help of the tapestry
yes so the tapestry uh
um prosecution imagines that
each of these things happening is
somehow you know the important one
and that you know that you can somehow
suss out of all of the things happening
you know that the fake news is priming
us one way
the democrats themselves are priming the
the public another way
trump is priming people a certain way
and then how about this
why are we arguing that trump incited
the public
did you see that happen it looks like it
right
it looks like trump said stuff about the
election and that incited
the public let me let me blow your mind
now
that didn't happen you thought you saw
it right
you thought you watched trump saying
stuff about the election
and you thought you watched people
getting worked up about it
and you thought you saw them attack the
capital over it
it didn't happen here's what happened
trump's base got trump incited
trump was just one of the people incited
his base was who was incited
do you know why his base was incited and
believed it was a fake
election is it because trump said so
no you idiots not you i'm
talking about other people you're the
smart ones
no no trump believed the election was
was stolen because his base believed it
why did his base believe it because it's
believable
and we live in a world in which is
perfectly believable
and is and what their expectations were
violated because they expected to win
and then they didn't get one now does
that mean they're right
well we don't have evidence that they
were right or that they were wrong
we have a non-transparent system which
has not been fully audited
we can say for sure that there's no
court proven evidence of massive
fraud we all agree with that but your
by your illegitimate press and your
illegitimate politicians
have told you just by repetition
that if you can't find evidence in a
hidden system
that means there's no problem that's
stupid
that's just stupid if you can't find
evidence
it just means you can't find it doesn't
mean it's not there when i go look
for ketchup in my refrigerator and i
can't find it
have i proven it's not there well if i
were good at looking at things it would
be close to a proof
but i'm really bad at looking at things
if i open my refrigerator i can't find
the ketchup
it's just a guy thing it's just a sea of
noise in there i
i can't find the ketchup but that
doesn't mean it's not in there
it's in there i didn't put the kitchen
ketchup in a drawer
right it's in there i just can't find it
so i haven't proven it doesn't exist
because i can't find it
and that's what we've been sold that the
ketchup doesn't exist because you can't
find it
oh by the way you also haven't opened up
the door
to look for it because it's a
non-transparent
system um
again i lost my train of thought i'm
sure it was really good
i shouldn't uh digress so much all right
um but i could win i could totally win
the president's case from this point i
would just make sure that
people understood that there are uh
that the tapestry of causes are not just
trump causes there's an entire tapestry
of his base
believing that the the election was
fraudulent and why did they believe it
because they live in the world in which
everything they've been presented has
been a lie
the fine people hoax the drinking bleach
oh you just go down the line
so the people who said the election was
fair are the same people
roughly speaking same not really the
same but feels the same
as the people have been lying about for
the last four years why would they
believe it
and what what possible reason would
anybody have
to believe that a non-transparent system
run by serial liars with
gigantic interest in falsifying the
result
would have been fair and free what
exactly would be the reasoning for them
to accept
that uncritically now it could be true
i want to say this as clearly as
possible i personally
don't have any proof of widespread
election fraud
do you do you have any i'd like to see
it if you have it
i don't have any i've seen statistical
indications but i don't think that they
hold up in court
those statistical indications may be
enough for you i'm not even sure if
they're true
much less you should interpret them the
way you might be interpreting them
let's talk about uh mike lindell in his
video in which he says there's 100
proof that we know the election was
fraudulent
there were a number of claims he made i
recognized a number of them as
having been debunked but there was one
claim that
uh he he held out as his strongest claim
his absolute proof he called absolute
proof and
i asked on twitter for people who had
any
debunking sources to his claim
the claim was that there is documented
evidence that you can see
chinese intrusions into our voting
system
that there are logs showing the ip
addresses and the ip addresses clearly
come from china
and that you can trace what those ip
addresses did
once inside the system and what they did
was flip
votes from trump to biden now that's the
claim on the video
by um lindell so i asked people on
twitter
if that's true you know has anybody
dealt with that or tried to debunk it
and the evidence i got is that the
source of the information
is not mentioned and i said
what are you telling me that the the
absolute proof the 100
proof the the log of data that is the
100
proof there's no indication where that
log of data came from
apparently there isn't so
what kind of credibility do you put on a
it's a very detailed thing by somebody
who is allegedly an expert in this
but the source of the data
is not mentioned
what what kind of credibility would you
put on that
zero zero yeah the right answer is zero
even if it's true even if it's true
the amount of credibility you should put
on it is zero
because when somebody says here's my
data from a source
unknown that's the end of the
conversation
that is the end of the conversation it's
not the beginning
it's the end don't tell me about your
data that you
got from your secret source mike lindell
i love michael lindell by the way a big
fan of his
uh pillow as well as his company and and
what he's done
but um and he's a great salesperson he's
he's clearly making an impact on the
election
or at least on the politics of it
but we need a source mike lindell
we need a source for that data or it's
not helping
it's not helping if you don't have a
source
all right so
let's see if the uh impeachment trial
does what we hope it would do
i'll bet it won't um
governor cuomo's getting a lot of heat
today's
new report is a his advisor one of his
top advisors or his top advisors
admits that they were hiding uh the
number of deaths in nursing homes in new
york
because they didn't want to get in
trouble
what yeah they're saying it directly
so the cuomo administration at least his
aid and i assume the governor was part
of this decision
they they admit at least on a phone call
somebody admitted that they hid the
information
to keep it out of the press
now the excuse was that trump was
putting uh
legal pressure on them and because they
had legal pressure on them
they didn't know what to do and they
sort of panicked basically
because they didn't want to go to jail
but they
also didn't want to lie and if they had
a choice of lying or going to jail
it looks like they chose lying because
they didn't want to go to jail
now that probably wasn't a wise decision
in retrospect we but people do make bad
decisions under pressure so
i don't doubt that that's what was
happening sounds reasonable i don't know
but it's reasonable um so
should cuomo be impeached for that
well i don't think i would buy his book
about how to handle a
how to handle an epidemic or a pandemic
uh i feel like that should hurt his book
sales a little bit
but i'm trying hard to stick to
my original philosophy that i had at the
beginning of the pandemic
that our leaders would make big mistakes
and we should forgive them in advance
because there's no way there wouldn't be
big mistakes in the fog of war
and guessing what works and guessing
what doesn't work
there had to be big mistakes but this
one doesn't feel like the other mistakes
does it
it would be one thing if you underplayed
or overplayed masks or you thought
hydroxychloroquine was a
good risk management thing but this
feels different
doesn't it this doesn't feel like a
mistake that had anything to do with the
let's say the fog of war it looks like a
mistake of somebody just covering their
ass
because they got caught in a mistake so
it's the covering your ass part that
is really the unforgivable part
i actually do forgive still i know you
don't
but i'm going to stick with my
philosophy and not change it which is
that
our experts really didn't know what to
do and
some of them were going to do the wrong
thing this nursing home thing was
clearly a mistake
but it was a mistake you kind of
expected
you know so i don't think i would judge
that as harshly as many of you do
even though people died even though it
was a mistake even though you probably
should never be reelected
yeah you prob that should probably be
the end of your political career
but still put it in context
uh interesting story there's a
ammunition
i don't know if they're wholesaler or
retailer they must be retailer
but they sell ammunition and it's a
phoenix ammunition f-e-n-i-x
and then in parentheses kulak i don't i
don't know what the real name of the
company is
but they have a new policy in which they
won't sell you ammunition
if you check a box that says you voted
for joe biden
they won't sell you ammunition
and i thought to myself is that legal
it is right that's legal
or is it can somebody tell me if that's
even illegal or legal
because biden voters do not fall into
any protected group right
they're not necessarily women or
minorities or anything else
so and the reasoning is that joe biden
is trying to destroy their company
by making it hard to buy ammunition and
so he doesn't want to support
their voters i feel like that's fair
i feel like it's fair but i'll tell you
what else it is
it is also elon musk brilliant
this is elon musk brilliant because how
much advertising does phoenix ammunition
need to do now
none they can just take whatever their
their advertising budget was and just
throw that away because they don't need
advertising for a while
this is brilliant this is how to
advertise
because do you think conservatives are
going to love this company for this
decision
oh yeah oh yeah i don't identify
conservative
but even i love this company for doing
this
because they're completely within their
rights i think
right i mean i need to fact check on
that but i think they're within their
rights
and if they are this is a perfectly good
statement and they say directly we don't
want your money
if you were a biden supporter we we'd
rather make less money
than sell ammunition to people who are
trying to put us out of business
it's not a bad play it's pretty clever
all right in the category of the left
eating their own because they don't have
as much
trump fodder to go after
here are the latest ones a writer named
nathan robinson
who used to work for the guardian
had tweeted that the canceled culture is
nonsense
because everyone who gets quote
cancelled ends up on their feet and they
get book deals and
and they come out fine and so his point
that
point is that there's not really a
canceled culture per se that's sort of
overblown well he was just fired from
the guardian for writing about u.s
military aid to israel
a little bit politically incorrect i
guess
so he got cancelled
um joss whedon who is
no friend to president trump uh
but very successful uh director type has
been blamed
by many people for uh being a horrible
person to work with
and uh more more people who have worked
with him are coming out to try to cancel
him as being
here's the latest claim
on one of the movies i guess buffy the
vampire slayer
there was a rule saying that he was not
allowed in a room alone with
uh with this woman michelle who i think
was 14 at the time
he wasn't allowed to be in the room
alone with her
okay that says something so we don't
know which of these allegations against
him are real and which are not but there
sure are a lot of them
sure are a lot of them uh but he's
getting cancelled by the left
so the left continues to eat their own
in an amusing
way which we enjoy
uh somebody says uh phoenix
i guess it's phoenix f-e-n-i-x ammo
already sold out
we'll get some more ammo guys we'll send
some more business your way
you know as i have
promised you i want to be part of the
solution
to this cancel culture now just a small
part i've got
you know 600 000 whatever followers on
twitter
so it's you know medium small but
every time somebody gets canceled for
something that's just purely
i'm gonna i'm gonna promote them i'm
gonna let you know
so that if you have a choice about where
to spend your money maybe you throw a
little let the people who got canceled
and you support free speech that way
so uh if you hear of any other examples
of people getting canceled
let me know and i would i would include
in this
just just to show how fair i am i'm
going to include in this nathan robinson
who got fired from the guardian who
didn't even believe in cancel culture is
real
but he's obviously a high-end
writer and i think that nathan robinson
should get a job offer
and i'd like to see him come out well
just like he said other people who got
cancelled dead
just because he might be more i don't
know if he is actually
but if you imagine he's more
left-leaning i'm not sure if that's true
so don't take that as true
but if he is that shouldn't make a
difference
he got cancelled people who got canceled
let's support him now if joss whedon
gets canceled that's because he's doing
criminal horrible things i'm not going
to support him but if he just got
canceled for freedom of speech
uh or supporting the president or any of
that stuff
then i think we should uh throw you a
little money
put a little money your way all right
um
nationalism was over uh well i'm not
going to read the second part of that
that's pretty provocative thing you're
saying there
all right let me see this question uh
scott scott scott did you hear msnbc's
nicole wallace
suggesting drone striking u.s citizens
recently
yeah i think the context was uh
malicious right
so the context was if there was some
militia that was
a domestic terror organization
i'm not sure i take the drone strike
thing too seriously don't make the same
mistake
that that the left always makes which is
to take everything as literal
i don't believe she means use a drone
strike against people who voted for
trump
right i don't believe she means that i
think she means if we could identify a
genuine
fbi certified domestic terror group who
might actually go
kill people that why would you treat
them differently than any other
domesti than any other terrorist group
so i think it was more of a
it was more of a conceptual point it
wasn't really about drones striking
any americans so i will use the same
standard
to defend her that i do when other
people use hyperbole
it's just hyperbole in fact i think
there should be a cabinet level position
and it should just be me in that cabinet
to explain to people how communication
works
literally just to explain how
communication works
because people think they can read minds
based on what you say
oh i see what you say but i'm going to
read your mind and then read into what
you say a completely different meaning
there needs to be a cabinet level
position of just to explain to the
public that that's not a thing
they don't have mind reading ability
yeah my book
loser think that's over my shoulder here
talks about this a highly successful
book which you should
be reading people are loving it and
yeah it would be the ministry of truth
no it wouldn't be the ministry of truth
because the ministry of truth would tell
you what's true
and of course that would be a problem
because people should decide for
themselves what is true
i would only tell you how communication
works
i would only tell you no this person is
using hyperbole
it's a common form of communication it
doesn't mean
she wants an actual physical drone to
kill
actual people when biden says that some
eos would be dictator-like
he doesn't mean all eos he means
the kind that you shouldn't do the kind
that you need a congressional vote of a
certain kind
so that's what i would do i'll just
explain how talking works
i would explain that if the context has
been removed
then you can't understand it you have to
get the rest of the context just simple
stuff
and just act like the public doesn't
understand that because they don't
they don't understand that video is
mostly a lie
people still think that if they saw it
with their own eyes they've seen truth
but in the world of 2021 and 2020
if you saw it with your own eyes on
video it's probably fake
it's probably out of context probably
more often than not
all right department of speech precision
yeah maybe who's my favorite drummer
um you know i'm developing some favorite
drummers but uh but i don't have one yet
all right that's all for now and i will
uh
talk to you later
all right youtubers uh
okay there is no evidence that i have a
favorite drummer
that is correct
i don't know if i would be a good press
secretary because the problem with being
a press secretary
is that you have to basically you have
to say what your
boss wants you to say you don't really
get to say whatever you want to say
so being handicapped by having to say
what my boss wants me to say
would largely make me ineffective at
that job
because i'd really need to do it my way
or i wouldn't be that effective
all right that's all i got for now and
i'll talk to you tomorrow
