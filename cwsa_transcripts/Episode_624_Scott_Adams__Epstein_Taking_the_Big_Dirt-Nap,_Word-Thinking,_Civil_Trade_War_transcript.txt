[Music]
hey everybody come on in here
it's time for coffee with scott adams
it's a very special coffee with scott
adams
because well why not it should be
special
hey jack good to see you everybody
come on in here take a seat
we've got things to talk about yes yes
we're gonna be talking about stuff but
first
you know what you want you want the
simultaneous sip
and if you'd like to enjoy simultaneous
sipping with people all over the world
with good intentions the dopamine hit
that gets you going
all you need is a copper mug or glass
starting a chalice a tanker
a thermos a flask a vessel of any kind
filler with your favorite liquid i
like coffee hey thomas
join us now for the simultaneous sip
oh
well so i know you want to talk about
uh jeffrey epstein taking as
as my late father used to call it the
big dirt map
so has there ever been
a more suspicious suicide nope
it is the world's most suspicious
suicide
now how hard is it to kill yourself in
jail
well i don't know i i suppose if you
tried to
hang yourself for something maybe that
would work
but i would think that the surefire way
to do it is
i can't imagine that they don't have
access to drugs
in jail don't you think
some kind of drug made into into his
his cell now here's the interesting
thing
epstein is the only person in the world
i can think of maybe you can think of
another example
can you think of anybody else in the
world that a hundred percent of the
people in the world
including epstein wanted him to be dead
have you ever seen anything like that
i've never seen a situation where
everybody wanted somebody to be dead
including the person
he wanted to be dead his victims wanted
him to be dead the public wanted him to
be dead
even the people who were his friends
they definitely wanted him dead
because he could he could be talking
about the situation
now of course the rumor mill will
crank up and people are going to say
it's those clintons
you know epstein was just about to out
them and
and then those clintons had him killed
in
jail maybe
maybe you know if i had to bet on it
i'd bet against that i would say that
the most
obvious explanation is that he wanted to
kill himself
um oh somebody says he hung himself
already confirmed by the new york post
i we're still early on in this
so i wouldn't assume that the early
information is accurate
but somebody said cardiac arrest and
somebody said hanging
and are those the same if you cut off
your supply of air do you have cardiac
arrest and therefore they're similar i
don't know
so your filter is on fire scott
somebody says so
in this case my guess is that he hung
himself or killed himself
one way or the other but he may have had
a lot of encouragement from a lot of
different people
there may be something or somebody on
the outside that he cared about
that you know he wanted to spare some
pain he probably thought he had no
chance of avoiding jail
so i think he probably took the path
that made most sense
now you might be asking yourself
how do you kill yourself by hanging
if you're already on suicide watch
what does it mean to be on suicide watch
if nobody say if nobody's watching i
would think the minimum requirement for
a suicide watch is
somebody watching to see if there's any
suicide
so there's something strange going on
here and it's possible
that the guards the guards may be in on
it
and this is the weirdest case because
imagine if you will
that we someday learn that somebody else
was complicit
let's say we learned that somebody else
either turned around
so it could happen let's say a guard
maybe somebody slipped him a rope
does anybody care about prosecuting
anybody who might have helped him i
don't know that anybody helped him but
it's it's likely that somebody had to
turn around or look the other way
or provide an asset like a rope or
something
maybe but personally
i wouldn't even really care somebody
says it's 100 murder
what if it is do you care
you could poke me on a jury trial and
say
okay here's the video the forensic
evidence
100 evidence conclusively proving that
this prisoner killed him do i care
i'm afraid i don't i'm afraid i don't
care
because if you kill somebody who wants
to die and 100 of the planet earth wants
him to die
that's what i call a special case
you know i think we all agree that you
want the laws to be applied equally
except in this case can't we have one
exception
where the laws are not applied equally
and
i would say you know you can limit it to
this case say all right
how about the laws apply equally whether
you're rich or poor
you know black or white male or woman
the law should apply equally
okay but one exception just one
exception
if you happen to be an accused serial
pedophile who wants to kill yourself
and a hundred percent of the people on
the planet earth also want to kill you
including your best friends
maybe then we turn the other turn around
and just let it happen
all right we'll be jabbering about that
a lot uh obviously
yet um it might leave a hole in the
investigations to find out who else was
alive
who else was involved i think what this
will
leave is that his assistant and
and the women who were victims are the
remaining
witnesses but keep in mind that
uh epstein probably was never going to
be
his own witness so i don't think he
would have told us anything
that we needed to know to know who was
guilty of what
i believe all the evidence would have
come from other people anyway
so i don't know that this makes any
difference unless he had secrets
that people thought he was going to
spill in return for
some kind of reduced sentence but i
don't see any kind of reduced sentence
when you're 66 and you've
you've been accused of such things i
mean what would that look like
you know get it down to 20 years so that
he's only 86 when he gets out of jail
yeah so i'm not sure that anybody
worried about
why he knew all right maybe they did
let's talk about some other things
um oh and then i guess we have to
mention that epstein
implicated george mitchell and bill
richardson i've seen himself but one of
the victims
how how reliable do you think that is
if you hear that one of the um so-called
victims
i won't say so-called let's call let's
call the victims
um if you hear that one of the victims
so now that he's dead you don't have to
say alleged so
epstein's dad's we don't have to say
he's an alleged pedophile we could just
call him anything we want now he's dead
so we can call the victims victims that
are not alleged victims
so one of the victims said that george
mitchell and bill richardson
were somehow involved in all this stuff
does that sound
credible to you i'm gonna say
no i'm gonna say no
doesn't mean it's impossible but it's
also not
impossible that you know you and i were
on the airplane
i wasn't but maybe you were prince
andrew i don't know that any of these
names are credible
that doesn't mean that it didn't happen
you know you can't say i can't prove a
negative i can't prove something didn't
happen
but when i hear the victim naming names
um i i just don't leap
to guilty i just don't leap that
so he's with ken delay
so i think i would suggest that you do
the same
if evidence comes out later that
suggests there are specific people who
are guilty of specific things then maybe
you could take that more seriously
depending on the evidence but if you
have
one person whose credibility has been
questioned
naming some names i don't think we can
quite
leap to guilty same with dershowitz
dershowitz has pointed out that the
people
accusing him have long histories of
literally making up accusations
so if you ever get accused of a heinous
crime
you want to be in dershowitz's situation
which is the person making the
accusation has a long history
of lying and accusing people of stuff
that's your ideal situation
so i think dershowitz risk if that's if
if it all comes down to one person's
claims and then
one or two people and they're not
credible i would say he's in good shape
um so let's talk about
bill maher and i guess bill engel was on
his show
and they both agreed that maybe a
short-term
recession i don't know how long the
short term is for a recession
would be better than keeping trump as
president
to which i say what exactly is the
danger of trump
i don't know exactly what that's
referring to
because all of the noise about him being
a white supremacist
is largely coming from the other side i
don't know a single person not a single
person who's a republican
or a conservative or a trump supporter
i'm sure they exist
but i've never met one who believes that
trump is a white supremacist
never met one but the entire other side
believes it to the point where it's a
national story
so whose fault is it is it the fault
of all the people who are looking at the
same evidence everybody else is and say
um i don't see it it doesn't look that
way to me
or is the is it the fault of the people
who are
uh suffering tds because their news
sources have
have triggered them into a state of
continuous
rage and unhappiness whose fault is it
seems to me it's sort of a shared fault
people who say that
the way trump speaks he should know
would cause this sort of reaction i
would agree with that
to a degree there there are some things
the president says and the way he says
them
that i hear them and i say oh i would
have said that differently
but that also applies to everything else
he says
there isn't a single thing that this
president has ever said
that i listen to and i say well that's
just the way i would have said it
and so we live in a world where i don't
know if you can get the good without the
bad
you can't really you know hire the
politician that has all the good stuff
and no bad stuff
it'd be great if you could so trump has
this mixed bag
in which he gets people very worked up
and makes them unhappy
and causes you know civil uh civil
distress at the very least that's real
i think if you're a trump supporter you
should not discount that to zero
you know in terms of how important it is
it's a big deal
you know the uh the national
mood and mind is quite affected by the
things he does
but if you were going to here's the the
mental exercise that i ask people to do
imagine that everything that trump said
had come out of the mouth of obama
or just a democrat but you know pick
obama just because we all know him
suppose obama had said
that the immigration on our southern
border is
so bad that it's an invasion suppose
he'd said that
oh that's right he did
did anybody complain no because it came
from obama
but when president trump said there's an
invasion people said well
keyword invasion must mean you're a
racist
if if president trump spoke of a
rodent infestation in baltimore
but let's say it was somebody else said
it let's say it was a
famous civil rights hero
would that bother you no because when
representative cummings used exactly the
same word
speaking of exactly the same situation
nobody was bothered so
we have all of this up all this evidence
of of
trump saying things that are sort of you
know close to something that somebody
else could have said
but if someone else had said it you
would have interpreted it
differently is that trump's fault
is it trump's fault that he uses the
same language and talks a similar way
but it's continually taken out of
context for political purposes
a little bit it's a little bit his fault
because he could choose different words
things that are harder to take in a
context but it would also
make him look like every other
politician and i don't think people
wanted that
i think people said here's a politician
it looks like he's going to break some
dishes
but when he's done we'll get some stuff
that other politicians
couldn't get for us so when trump drops
a dish and breaks it
do you say you got to get rid of this
president or do you say
no that's what we signed up for we
signed up for broken dishes
because we wanted something bigger than
broken dishes in return
and and most of his supporters would say
he's delivering exactly
that with lots of broken dishes just
like we expected
all right let's talk about yang i i
praised yang for being the only person
that i could think of
who hadn't grotesquely lied
in the process so far but
people pointed out to me that yang
recently got cornered into the question
of whether
trump is a white supremacist
an actual white supremacist and yang
used weasel words and basically said yes
you know he tried to word it in a way
that that made it depersonalized
but i think in the end he failed he did
a really good job
i mean he made a heck of a try to say
well
if somebody acts a certain way and talks
a certain way
then you know people are going to take
it a certain way
which is different from saying he's a
white supremacist right
he's just observing other people's
reaction to trump
and describing him that's fair
all right when yang said well you know
people are taking him
that way that was a fair comment people
are
taking him that way why yang leaves out
i think disingenuously is why
why we're taking him that way is because
people like yang
go in public and say he's a white
supremacist
that's why people take him that way i
don't believe that people would have
reached that opinion on their own if the
news had simply reported what's
happening
instead of what they imagine he's
thinking
so yeah we talked about epstein for the
people joining us
live i'm not going to circle back to
epstein but you can see it in the replay
so i would say that yang has now lost
his authenticity
it was sort of the only thing good about
his campaign it was really good
authenticity is really good and it
seemed to indicate some independence of
thought
some originality um some competence
a lot of things we like so yang has
always been
interesting i don't think he was
complete enough to be a politician
because he sort of concentrated on his
ubi thing
but by joining the people who have to
call
the president a white supremacist
because apparently that's
the new litmus test so you can't be the
democratic
candidate unless you call him a white
supremacist
now a lot of people like donnie deutsch
let me just say it donny deutsch
if i found that if i heard that donnie
deutsch
had died in a jail cell i would think
the same of him
as i think of epstein i'll just let that
sit out there for a while if donnie
deutsch
died in a jail cell he's not in jail i
don't think he's committed any crimes
that i know
hypothetically if he died in the jail
cell
in whatever whatever way suicide or
murder
i wouldn't feel bad because in my mind
donnie deutsch and epstein are the same
guy
in my mind see what i'm doing here
i'm doing what donnie deutsch is doing
donnie deutsch said
hey if you support the president you
must be a white supremacist
that's probably
i would say i'm not going to say it's
worse than serial pedophilia because
we consider that the worst of the worst
that's sort of a 10 and a 10 right
serial pedophilia on the badness range
it's a 10 and a 10.
donnie deutsch going on television
and consistently saying that people who
voted for trump
are white supremacists
is a 10 it's a 10 and a 10. and so
my complete lack of sympathy for epstein
dying in his jail cell i would share
because i think what donnie deutsch is
doing is on the same level
of pure evil now some people are going
to say hey
he's not pure evil it's just what he
believes he would like to help the
country
etc maybe i suppose
you know everybody who's a monster has a
reason
if you talk to epstein do you think
you'd say yeah you got me
if you were alive do you think he'd say
yeah you got me
i'm a monster i'm a monster do you think
epstein would have said that
no he would have said well i was giving
these girls money
they didn't seem to mind everybody wins
that's what he would have said right
epstein would not have said
yeah i'm a monster you got me likewise
donnie deutsch has a perfectly good
explanation for why
he's trying to create a race war in the
united states
because he thinks it's true now if you
ask donnie deutsch
do you believe in the uh the fine people
hoax
what do you think he'd say you say he
believes it
he is either suffering from tds
or lying we can't tell because we can't
read his mind
but in terms of the badness of what he's
doing
in public and regular on a regular basis
uh labeling how
you know 60 million people as white
supremacists
is just about as bad as you can get
10 out of 10. now i don't want anything
bad to happen to donnie deutsch in the
same way that i don't want anything bad
happen to
anybody but i'm just saying that on a
moral
uh level he is similar to epstein
so um let's talk about some other stuff
i saw a story on cnn i was watching the
fake news on cnn
and i forget the details but there's
some i guess there's a
mine that had been closed for
environmental reasons
and trump met with the ceo and now the
mine is going to be opened
and there's a risk to 80 miles of river
that could be you know polluted and all
the while you know all the fish could
die or whatever so the
cnn was presenting it as an econo as a
environmental catastrophe and that there
was a reason it was closed in the first
place
and now the trump administration is
opening it just for
commerce and money and all the wrong
reasons and it's going to destroy
the environment so i'm watching this
news and i'm saying to myself
wow if any of that's true
that's pretty bad i i wouldn't support
the administration polluting 80 miles of
river
to open a mine i'm sure we don't need
the mine that much
can't be that many jobs that's an
environmental disaster
so i was waiting for the other side of
the story
yeah pebbled mine that's right pebble
mine it's called
um and the other side of the story i
thought
was gonna look something like this it
never happened so i don't know
but i thought the other side of the
story was going to be
the company figured out a way
to not pollute they have some new
technology
they're going to do something
differently and maybe they promised the
the government
that they would use their new technology
and they would watch the river
and if and if their new technology
didn't work they could detect it pretty
quickly
and then they would you know shut things
off because it didn't work
so you know you could do a little bit of
pollution and say oh we thought there
would be none but there's a little bit
stop everything so i was waiting for
that side of the story
i don't know that it was a sound like
that but it feels like it would have
been something along those lines don't
you think
do you think that when the president met
with the ceo
the ceo said to the president hey you
know we were polluting like crazy
we'd like to do that again do you mind
if we pollute like crazy
we can create a thousand jobs or
whatever the number is
do you think the president said huh
pollutes like crazy
destroys 80 miles of river for sure
or at least a big risk but a thousand
jobs out of 360 million people
totally i'm in i'm down let's open that
thing
do you think it went down like that
because that's sort of what cnn suggests
it's the fakest of news now to be clear
if that's what actually happened i don't
support that
i think you'd have to reject that pretty
strongly
but i don't know that it happened i
don't know what happened because the
reporting was only
one side of a story that has two sides
what good was that
all right um
i'm amused by this litmus test
who was it was i forget who it was was
it biden people were
yelling onto the stage that he has to
who is the candidate who was forced to
answer the question
whether president trump was an actual
white supremacist
uh let me back up a little bit here i'm
amused that that's a litmus test and
they're all going to have to answer that
question
because it should be the question that
disqualifies you
oh is it delaney it was the lady so
delaney i guess is the one who was
resisting
the longest and using that kind of
language
delaney has a big problem which is his
face
he just doesn't have leadership face
there's something goofy about his face
as far as i can tell
he's very talented and reasonable so if
you could
take delaney's set of talents
and move them to a better face
you might have something now i would i
would hate to
i would hate to be the guy who says we
should judge people by their looks
because i don't think we should
we we don't we don't elect handsome
or beautiful presidents we generally
don't right they're not good looking in
general they tend to be older et cetera
some are better than others obama was
good looking
bill clinton was good-looking-ish
kennedy was good-looking but we don't
elect him for that reason that said it
certainly matters
the the look has to be at least
presidential and serious and all that
or where the voters have a problem with
it yeah goofy looking
um i think that can work in business as
long as you're performing but
for politics that's tough and
and i don't mean to be cruel
uh he probably knows he's goofy looking
he probably knows it um
and i say that as someone who's not
attractive
so when somebody like me says that
someone else is not attractive i'm
talking about my people
my people are the attractive men in the
world
so if i talk if i say another man is
unattractive
i'm talking about my people so keep it
in context
um the dumbest thing that the country is
doing
is considering a civil trade war
literally a trade war in which democrats
will not buy from
any company that has a republican
connection and vice versa
can you think of a worse idea can you
think of
any worse idea
than a domestic trade war and we're
actually
we're actually heading in that direction
now i don't believe in the slippery
slope so i don't believe that it's
actually
going to go to that but we are
perilously close to it
and i thought to myself well thank you
nancy for saying that
and i thought to myself is there anybody
in the country who's smart enough to
know
that you probably can win a trade war
with another country
but you really can't win one if it's
internal
because it's your country if one side
wins and one side loses
is still all the same country there's no
way that can be good
as a civil war but
i do think there's a way that you could
convince another country to give you a
better trade deal
a little bit of trade war might uh get
you there
somebody says such a moronic statement
well must be a democrat
i'll get a block carla i don't know who
you're talking about
but on this periscope
and in the world of scott
if you make a comment that is just a
personal comment about somebody
i'm not interested so you can make your
personal comments somewhere else
but if you talk about policy or ideas or
thoughts and
that involves personalities that's good
now even when i talk about
somebody's appearance um
again i'm not trying to be unkind it's
just an objective fact that people look
differently
and people react to that um
i want to i want to introduce a phrase
that i invented yesterday
i call it your game path game as in a
video game
game path and it it involves the idea
that we're a simulation
and not an original species most of you
know the idea
that it's very unlikely well let me
back up the simulation theory says that
we will eventually reach a point where
we can create
computer simulations of people who
believe they are people and have full
lives
within computer software but they will
believe they're humans
they'll look like humans they'll act
like humans they'll believe they have
free will everything else
and that it's very unlikely that
that we're a real species because we
know that once you can do that once
probably we'll do it a bunch of times
and there could be a billion to one
more artificial realities than there are
original species if there are any
original species at all so simulation
theory says
we could be real we could have evolved
or god could have put us there or
whatever your belief is
we could be exactly what you see and
we're real maybe
but it's a trillion to one against it
so i take the odds of a trillion to one
and say okay we're almost certainly
a simulation if we were a simulation how
would you build it if you were the
programmer
if you were the programmer and you were
building this simulation
i think you would give some characters
special something
some of your characters would be
background characters or npcs
they're not really thinking people
they're just background
others might be real people who put
their personalities into an avatar
and so you know how you meet some people
and they seem
extra alive have you noticed that
have you ever walked around the corner
looked in somebody's eyes that you'd
never met before
and knew they were important to your
life
i've had that experience most of you
have usually you end up marrying that
person
um but there are some people who are
just extra
present so imagine that it's a
simulation some of the characters are
based on real people or managed by real
people or whatever
and some are just background so that's
the theory
so what i'm introducing is what i call
the game path and it under
and it assumes that each of us have a
challenge
within the game that is the simulation
and the reason i introduce this is have
you noticed
that there's some problems that you have
in your life
that repeat beyond what could possibly
be a coincidence
have you noticed that that some of you
will get the same type of problem
one after another but entire other
fields of types of problems you won't
get at all
i'll give you an example um
i've only been to i've been south of the
border
a few times i'm i'm in mexico right now
getting ready to leave
the last time i was in central america
was costa rica
and it was the worst trip of my life
because on the last day before i had to
fly
i got a severe bacterial infection or
stomach flu or something
and i had to i had to fly back home
sicker than i've ever been sick and so
when i knew i was going to come here
i'm in cabo i said to myself
i really want to go there's only one
thing i fear which is getting a stomach
flu
the day before i travel it's the only
thing i'm worried about
it's the only thing today i'm traveling
yesterday i had a severe stomach ache
yeah i don't know if it was montezuma's
revenge or food poisoning or what it was
but i was really sick yesterday
and i woke up this morning feeling a
little bit better i think i can travel
but one of the odds now when you're when
you're at a resort
all the the water is purified and
you don't you don't really have access
to anything that should give you
a stomach flu from drinking the water
it's all very protected little enclave
we never left
we never left the you know confines of
the
of the purified water and it's mostly
bottled water etc
um yeah somebody says oh my god you
created it
maybe i may have manifested it by
thinking it too much
because what are the chances that the
only thing i was worried about
was exactly what happened what are the
odds
the only thing i was worried about i
wasn't worried about getting mugged i
wasn't worried about the airplane going
down
i wasn't worried about anything just
that one thing
and then it happened it happened on the
day that i didn't want it to happen
if it happened on the first day i'd say
well sometimes you get sick when you
travel but i'm glad it was the first day
yeah somebody said oh michelle's saying
my husband got montezuma's revenge in
cabo
well montezuma got me good um
so there's that but i want
i want you to keep this in mind when you
observe your life
do you see that there are certain sets
of circumstances
that just over and over and over happen
to you
beyond what chance would suggest maybe
you have a game path
maybe there's a specific challenge
that your simulation that you elected or
whoever programmed it elected for your
character
so maybe it's not a coincidence but also
maybe you're manifesting
so lots of possibilities i just want to
throw that out there
now one of the things i'd like to
suggest is
um i believe that i am unusually
free from let's say judgmental
judgmentalism or bigotry
because i believe in the simulation and
because i don't believe in free will i
think free will is an illusion
so when i see people doing things that i
wouldn't do and i don't like it
i don't say i hate that person you're a
piece of crap
i think well i wouldn't do that i'm glad
i'm not in that situation
i'm glad my brain is not organized in a
way that i would have to do that thing
this other person is doing
so i tend not to judge people and it
gets me in trouble
because i don't even judge you know that
donnie deutsch and epstein
what i've said is i don't have any
empathy for them
because objectively speaking what
they've done is you know
horrible for the world in a very similar
way
but i don't judge it because i think
that they are also
victims of having no free will they
believe what they believe
they think they're right and they don't
know the difference just like the rest
of us
we're all just trying to get by so i
also have a
have a thought that bigotry at least
ethnic
both ethnic i guess both ethnic and
gender bigotry
don't have the same utility
that they used to have if you imagine
hundreds of years in the past
you didn't have any way to know much
about another person
so if somebody from another ethnicity
walked up to you you'd say i
don't have any way to check you out the
one and only thing i know
is what kind of person you are and i've
got some you know some bias about
people who look like you so i'm going to
apply that just for safety
just to be cautious but now we live in a
world where
all you need is somebody's name and you
can check their entire social media
history you can check on people
very at a detailed level so you don't
need
prejudice anymore you don't need bigotry
about individuals because
i have a life straw with me but i didn't
use it for everything
um so you don't need bigotry the way you
maybe felt you needed it hundreds of
years ago
because bigotry was a terrible tool for
judging any individual it was very
ineffective but it was the best you had
now we have every other means of finding
out about people
we can you know hire them for on trial
bases
that it doesn't work out you make a
change so we have all kinds of different
mechanisms now where we can judge
individuals
we just don't need to judge groups of
people anymore
what would be an exception to that rule
immigration from countries that do not
have good records
that would be an exception in that case
um and you saw that with the muslim ban
the administration's decision it was to
use
bigotry is that the right word
certainly they were using pattern
recognition
and some common sense to say here's a
group of countries that we don't know
what we're getting because they don't
have good records we might not even be
getting the
the citizen that we think we're getting
you know it might be
a fake person you just don't know so in
the cases
that are fortunately rare where you
can't determine
anything about an individual for sure
then some gross very unpleasant
decisions
at least have utility you may still
because you're a good person say i'd i'd
rather take a little risk
than to treat people like that that
wouldn't be unreasonable
i think reasonable people can disagree
on that but
let's just say that for most situations
and most people
bigotry doesn't really it's just
outdated
because you can know as much as you want
about an individual
that's all you care about right when
you're hiring somebody you're not hiring
all the people who look like them you're
just hiring that person when you're
marrying somebody you're not marrying
all the people who look like that you're
just
marrying that one person so if you know
about that one person you're all set
and um i think that would be a useful
way to
see the world
somebody says somebody on here says that
third world countries have low iq levels
irrelevant that's my point would it
matter to you
that the average of any group no matter
what group you're talking about
has higher or lower iq it wouldn't
matter
because you're looking at individuals
and we do have the ability
to to judge whether individuals are the
the ones we want in the country
that they go to college if we have merit
based immigration
we could just look at their record so we
wouldn't have to
you wouldn't have to guess about an
individual based on the people who look
like them that's just antiquated
we have better tools now don't need to
do it
um somebody says yes because low iq
equates to more violence well you just
missed everything i just said
if you know about individuals then you
can make decisions about individuals
that's what the president wants to do
but we don't live in a world where you
have to make
decisions based on groups
just it's antiquated we have better
tools so
bigotry lost its utility
and if you still think it has utility
that's sort of on you
you know that's sort of on you
with the exception of countries that
don't have records and you can't tell
who the person is
that's that's the special case all right
uh so i
posted a blog post today actual writing
i don't know how many blog posts i'm
gonna write
i just did a few while i'm traveling uh
this one is on how we're using word
thinking
to make decisions
somebody says come on scott was there a
point there
come on scott what's that mean
[Music]
um what countries don't have records
countries such as syria don't have uh
reliable records a lot of stuff that got
destroyed in war so there aren't that
many of them but
they exist
can i deprogram donnie deutsch i doubt
it
because he's he's committed himself in
public
to a position and once people commit in
in public it's pretty hard to change
their minds
um yeah it looks like the traffic's
pretty high today
has there been someone somebody's asking
has there been someone in the past that
does what you do
or are you unique scott well everybody's
unique
i i'm not sure exactly that what that
question means
if you mean is there anybody who has
intentionally tried to
present a rational position of
the world surely such people must exist
i can't think of one
why did rome fall immigration somebody
says
is that why rome fell
i don't know about that
so have you noticed um this is the dog
that doesn't bark
so it's it's been national news that um
the find people hoax is raging
again it's been in a whole bunch of
publications
and all the talk you've seen about it
all the news coverage
do you notice something missing what is
missing
from all the conversation about
the fine people hoax what's missing
me i have
i am for most of the coverage
i think except for the coverage on the
right perhaps but when the left
talks about the hoax they don't put me
in the story
now think about how much trouble i've
caused
on the fine people oaks i
i'm one of the three horsemen right with
steve cortez and
and uh joel pollock the three of us have
been
out front debunking this hoax
so if you're telling a story about you
know how this situation happened
how do you leave me out of the story how
do you not
invite me on your show to talk about it
i'll tell you how you look at what i
wrote and you say to yourself
oh crap we can't have him on the show
but i'm going to say something that's
the most immodest thing you've ever
heard
are you ready i think you know me well
enough by this point that it won't
bother you
your opinion of me won't change even
though this is going to be unpleasant
get ready for it
go gird your loins whatever that means
gird your loins
why is that even the same here's what
i'm going to say
i don't think there's anybody more
persuasive than i am
certainly not on this topic now there
are more persuasive politicians
trump would be one but if you're just
having a conversation
and you're not trying to be the leader
which is a different type of persuasion
if you're just talking about a topic
you can't get much more persuasive than
i am
i think there's nobody who is willing to
take the chance
of putting me on the air because i would
obliterate
the fine people hoax at least for some
people most people don't change their
mind
regardless of the evidence but
i i don't think it's a coincidence
that nobody wants to put me on the air
and that nobody wants to interview me
do you remember how many people wrote
about me and contacted me
when i had my little uh what do you what
do you want to call it
my little uh public scandal a few weeks
ago
all of them like there was press all
over the place
that wanted to interview me tried to
reach me tried to get a quote
and it's because i'm a minor celebrity
and i said something
provocative in public on a political
topic it was political just because it
was in the news that's the only reason
and because
people associate me with saying good
things about trump so the politics was
sort of
accidentally associated with with uh
my thing
but you know that in my entire you know
famous life since i've been you know
known to the public
anytime i say something provocative my
phone starts ringing
because people want to write that story
about the minor celebrity who says
things that other people don't think is
true
it's the story that news organizations
like
better than all other stories
did they contact me none
zero zero on the left so i'm going to
say that
there was no media on the left who
wanted to talk to me
saying in public that one of the primary
beliefs in this country
isn't true and it's easy to prove think
about that
nobody doesn't that tell you
that they know it's not true doesn't it
do you think that cnn believes
that they could have me on the air and
that wouldn't go
poorly for them they know it would go
poorly
by the way i'm not sure if i would say
yes to any of those offers
because the problem with actually i know
i wouldn't say yes
so if a tv network said i'd like to have
you on
you know our segment is four minutes to
talk about your views i wouldn't
accept that because in those contexts
um the game is to run out the clock
and then end with something that doesn't
change anything so if i were to be
interviewed on cnn it would look like
this
scott tell us what you think uh let me
interrupt you
and by the time i was done i would have
gotten
60 of my message out they would wrap it
up with well we're not convinced and
then
go on so being on a time limited
format would be useless you can't really
determine anything that way
likewise agreeing to an interview in
which somebody else
paraphrases what i've said has no chance
of being persuasive
because the paraphraser would remove
the persuasion because they don't want
it to be persuasive
so i can't do a standard interview on
this
the only way i can do it is by writing
my own blog
doing my own content in whatever length
it takes to tell the story
and then hope that that gets some play
all right that's about all i have to say
about
um today
the joe rogan podcast yeah
joe rogan would be one of the few places
that
that any idea would get a fair hearing
think about that
if i said to you what what media outlet
is likely to give somebody a fair
hearing for
let's say a non-standard opinion not
many
joe rogan is one of them and then name
the second one
uh right who's the other one
uh well there are lots of podcasts that
that could do it plenty of podcasts but
you don't know of them
they they tend to be more obscure
all right oh candace yeah candace has a
long-form
show but she's also associated with the
political right and that's the group
that doesn't need to be convinced
yeah oh dave rubin this is a good
example dave rubin but now he's
associated with the political right
whether he likes it or not
so you're right so if you were thinking
of who could actually tell the story
i would say dave rubin and joe rogan
would be the top of the list
of people who could get that out there
all right
any questions
yeah you know this whole clinton body
count thing
yeah i would say you know i did the sam
harris
show and i did not think
that i could be persuasive on that
because the the topic
seemed to jump around a little bit yet
there's a certain amount of jumping
around you have to do for the benefit of
the audience to keep it interesting
so even in the long form it's hard to
make a point if other people are talking
um
breaking news russian skilled epstein so
think about this
what are the biggest beliefs that the
people on the left
have held that are the most important
beliefs
they believed in russia collusion which
has been debunked
meaning that they still think it
happened they believed in the
fine people hoax i mean that really is
the alpha hoax
that makes them believe all the other
ones that are just sort of well
why'd he use that word the other ones
are so weak
that by themselves they wouldn't have
much meaning but once you have the fine
people hoax
it gives people license to say you know
when he said infestation
even though he was talking about rats i
know what he was
thinking so if you kill the alpha hoax
the fine people hoax the others just
lose their power
because they're all fueled by the same
hoax
then what about climate change
what's the biggest hoax about climate
change now i'm not the person
who's going to tell you that the
scientists are wrong
i'm not going to tell you that co2 has
nothing to do with warming i'm i'm not
going to tell you the
earth is not getting warmer i'm not a
scientist
and i don't trust anybody who is on this
topic
nor can i evaluate their work
independently so i'm solidly in the camp
of
sounds important we should pay attention
to it but i don't i don't know what to
think
because i'm not qualified no matter how
much effort i put into it
i could not and i put a lot of effort
into it i spent a year
tracking down left and right opinions on
this
to see if i could form an independent
opinion and couldn't
because both sides lack credibility and
i can't judge them independently
so but here's something that i can judge
because both sides agree
and i've said this before but it's worth
repeating
the side that thinks that climate change
is
cataclysmic has estimated that in
economic terms it could take 10
off the gdp in what 70 years i think
let's say that's true let's say that
worst case
economic prediction is exactly accurate
that's telling us it's no big deal
because a 10
reduction in what the gdp would have
been in 70 years
remember everything doubles every 10
years it's just
the way stuff works um so
now let me let me reverse that i was
going to talk about something else but
let me just say that in 70 years
if if at the end point of that 70 years
our gdp
was 10 less than we thought it could
have been
you wouldn't even notice so in other
words
the people who are most concerned about
climate change the people most
incentive incentivized to give you a
scary story have put their best people
on the case
and come up with the scariest story that
it'll be a 10
hit to gdp that we wouldn't even notice
because that hit is you know spread over
70 years
it's not even like the hit comes on the
70th year
which you know maybe would count a
little bit the 10
has spread over 70 years it's like a
little bit this year
a little bit this year you wouldn't
notice any of it
and that's that's the horror story so i
would say
that based on the climate
scientists consensus about the economic
danger and i think they all buy into
those numbers
that that's shown as a hoax in terms of
not in terms of the science because that
part i can't evaluate
but a hoax in terms of how bad the
problem is in the future
now i haven't looked into this myself
but i understand
that michael moore has come down on the
side of
green technology being a scam
my understanding is that somebody he's
closely associated with
must have been his director or producer
for his earlier films
made his own film about green technology
he went into it thinking that he was
going to show that this is the way to go
green green green and discover that it's
all a fraud
that if you look at say electric cars an
electric car
is a coal is a coal powered car
[Laughter]
an electric car is a coal powered car
because the coal plates
coal plants make the electricity the
electricity goes into the car it's a
coal powered car
but the public sees it as green
technology
now of course if all the other sources
of electricity changed
well then it wouldn't be a coal powered
car but nobody knows how to get there
except for nuclear power
and that's apparently not on the
the green people's list so my
understanding is that the film is going
to come down hard
on on green technology being the way out
now combine these two things roger moore
who has
you know did i say roger moore
um what's his actual name
moore michael moore roger was in the
title of one of his films so michael
moore
i don't mean james bond who would be
roger moore
but michael moore
is credible he's credible on the left
and if he says something
that the people on the right like to
hear well then he's credible on that
side
so suddenly you have the most credible
person you could imagine
who would be believed by both sides
which is very rare
um and but let me let me pause to give
michael moore a compliment
i would say that i disagree with roger
moore
as much as i agree with him so i'm not
on his team but i'm not against
everything he says
it must be called out that he saw trump
coming before anybody on the left did he
he understood the population he
understood the voters
and he understood trump as a showman
because michael moore is a showman
i think he got trump the way other
people didn't
um and so he uh and so i give him credit
and if it's true i'm still waiting for
some verification but if it's true
that michael moore has looked at the the
data and made a u-turn
on green energy i think you have to
respect that
you gotta respect that so
uh so here's some respect for michael
moore that you probably didn't expect
from me
um now is that enough if you take
michael moore's debunking of the the
green energy
market if you add that to the fact that
the people who are
promoting um climate change risk
their own numbers disprove their major
theme
that is cataclysmic indeed their own
numbers show
we wouldn't even notice is that enough
to say that climate change
is a hoax even if it's true that co2 is
causing warming and even if it's true
we wish it weren't i think yes
i think yes so it seems to me that
the three pillars of the republican
not the republicans the democrats belief
if they came down to three hoaxes
there's the russia collusion hoax
the fine people hoax that says we have a
white supremacist president
and then the climate change hoax
and here again i'm only talking about
the economic predictions
being the hoax part because their own
numbers
show that it's no big deal you can
confirm that by the way
go go look at the united nations most
recent dependable numbers according to
them
and they'll tell you it's a 10 hit in 70
years literally
wouldn't notice now there will be a lot
of changes over 70 years
but change is inevitable
so think about that is there anything
like that on the republican side there
might be
yeah maybe maybe if i thought about it
for a few minutes i could come up with
you know the three big hoaxes that drive
the uh
drive the republican party well actually
it isn't too hard
one of the one of the hoaxes is that
i think one of the hosts is that there's
no way we can get to universal health
care
i don't think that's true i think it's
true that nobody has
like the plan that could work but we're
a pretty resourceful place
you know if you tell me here's the
challenge
you know have universal health care for
everybody in the united states or
insurance anyway
could we get there i think we could
i don't think we can get there just by
raising taxes
but i think we could get there so
uh i don't know how long it would take i
mean it might take 20 years but i think
we could get there
all right um
how can we form public policy with so
many hoaxes
good question well the way we do it is
poorly that's what we've seen so far
and that's why i always suggest until
you're
sick of hearing it
i suggest that we always favor plans
that we can
test if you can test it
in a small way that doesn't hurt too
much
then that's a good plan a good plan is
when you can test small
anything else is risky might turn out
your way
might not turn out your way but if you
can't test this small
it's risky um
have you ever seen a child scream in
terror when someone tries to remove a
band-aid
okay i don't i don't know the context of
that
oh yeah uh i heard rush
limbaugh talking about uh joel pollock
uh challenging biden
in iowa and
um it's it's good that rush is on the
same page
now i spent i can tell you that for most
of my early life
uh rush limbaugh seemed to sort of
republican
and he wasn't really my cup of tea but i
still listen to his show a lot
because he's really good at what he does
you know rush limbaugh no matter what
you think of his politics and you know i
understand half the country
despises his politics and maybe that
makes him dislike him too
but you can't you can't uh avoid the
fact
that man he's good at what he does same
with hannity
hannity you you can dislike him all you
want but man
is he good at what he does they both
have these
serious talent stacks that just that
just work perfectly
all right um
he's a good speaker you don't watch
hannity do you
somebody asked well um i watch all of
the
i watch all of the major news programs
on the major
networks cnn and fox news so i watch
them all
rush considers himself an entertainer
yeah and that's that's
i i'm glad you said that because that
was the first time i understood
who rush was because i think years ago
people were saying hey you're so good
why don't you run for
office because i think he could have won
don't you think
if if rush limbaugh had run for office
maybe not now but there was probably a
time
he could have run for office he probably
would have won he was good
but he said no i'm not a politician i'm
an entertainer
and then i understood it all he's an
entertainer well of course i knew that
but
but knowing that he that he labeled
himself an entertainer
kind of put it in a nice package he's a
great entertainer
even if you don't like his content even
if you don't like his political opinions
he's a great entertainer
all right did i see kamala's new bus
i think that's a fake video there's a
there's a video of kamala coming out of
some office and getting all excited
and then it switches to a picture of a
police bus
and you know it suggests that it's her
new bus with like police logos on it
i think it's just a fake video i would
not assume that was real
i'm sure it's a fake video um
we talked about yang already
all right i think that's about all we
got and i'm gonna
talk to you tomorrow have a great day
