hey everybody
just in time i like that some of you are
so punctual
you know punctuality is a sign of
character
and how many of you were taught by one
of your parents
or maybe both that uh
on time is late
how many of you were taught that if you
can't show up on time
you can't do anything you better show up
on time
that was drilled in to be um we had a
tradition that uh
my family my mother said you have to be
home at five o'clock
to eat dinner every night no exceptions
so wherever you were
you know if you didn't have a cell phone
or whatever no excuses
you had to find your way back to the
house at five o'clock
every night seven days a week no
exceptions
it was a great rule doesn't work in 2021
though well if you'd like to enjoy this
program to his
maximum potential and i know you do all
you need is a couple of marker glasses
tango chelstein
canteen juggerflash vessel of any kind
filled with favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now if you will for the
dopamine of the day the unparalleled
pleasure it's
it's called the simultaneous sip and i
don't think anything's ever been better
it's going to make your whole day are
you ready for this
this is going to be one of the best one
of the best here it comes
go
ah did you hear the millions of
coffee cups and vessels
being quenching people's thirst at the
same time
all around the world well no because
there weren't millions of them but
someday there will be
some day we have mere hundreds of
thousands
today
the george georgia passed some new uh
voting rules including uh requirement
for id
even for voting by mail and of course
democrats are calling this a jim crow
law
which works really well because most
people don't know anything about history
and they say to themselves
i've heard that phrase jim crow pretty
sure it's bad
oh this is one of those well that must
be bad
but if you actually knew your history
you would not see
a lot in common with jim crow laws
which were pretty aggressive and racist
and people who just want id for voting
now here's the question
watch the dog that wasn't barking
you ready one of the things i like to do
when i talk about the news because
nobody else
does this is to tell you what you didn't
hear
that's important so the story is sort of
sort of incomplete wouldn't you say
if this piece of information is missing
and it goes like this
there's an assumption here that your
poor uneducated people the ones who
would have the most difficulty getting
identification
because it actually costs something to
get identification you got to get your
birth certificate that might be
like 175 dollars you got to travel
somewhere
you got maybe take a day off of work
whatever
if you're working and but the assumption
is
that if these people voted instead of
being shut out from the system
they'd be better off
isn't that kind of a big assumption that
if these people who don't have
identification
voted that they themselves would be
better off
do you believe that because
i i think i'd like to see some evidence
of that
isn't the entire reason that the uh
united states
is not a democratic system
you know we're we're we have a
democratic elements within the republic
is it the whole point of a republic
that giving the the masses full control
and let let the majority just win every
time
well they're more of you so you win
wasn't that the whole point
that the that the masses can't be
trusted
you want the smarter people who actually
care about them
to be the ones making the decisions so
there is that concept and so i would say
we should at least
test the assumption that even if all
these extra people got to vote
let's say we help them get ids or
whatever it took
that they would be happier that they
would get what they wanted
do you think that's true do you think if
you let
uneducated people because
by and large these are the least
educated part of the population
now you don't have to be uneducated to
be poor but
you know on average that's where it's
that's where it's going
so i don't know i think there's some
basic
assumptions in here that need to be
challenged
we uh we like the concept that you know
everybody gets to vote
there's nobody who's against that but
shouldn't we at least challenge whether
there's any purpose of it what do we get
out of it
yeah we want everybody to vote everybody
agrees on that
and why why
do we want everybody to vote to get a
better outcome
right or at least get an outcome that
the the public
says is credible because the right
people voted and
everybody could did so i think we should
test our assumptions about why we care
about
anybody voting you know why can't
children vote
is there a reason that we don't let
children
let's say toddlers is there a reason we
don't let them vote
and what is it what is that reason
can you think of any reason that school
children should not
vote what would be the thinking
well i believe the thinking is that
they're not they're not as
capable right is there any other reason
that you can think of why would we deny
the vote
to an 11 year old now i'm in favor of
denying the vote to an 11 year old but
i'm asking you what's the reason
isn't the reason that we think the
quality of the decisions
would not be helped by letting 11 year
olds vote
right and and don't we believe that the
11 year old here's the key point
right so here's the key point don't we
believe that if the 11 year old
were allowed to pursu pursue
you know their own interests that they
wouldn't do it right
isn't that the assumption because
otherwise we'd let them vote
we say oh you know what's good for you
and we we want what's good for you too
so go ahead and vote and you'll have a
greater chance of getting what's good
for you
nobody thinks that because you know an
11 year old isn't good
at knowing what's good for them they're
not going to understand the topics
they would be easily misled let me ask
you this
are people who are let's say 11 year old
kids
or and this is i realize this is
offensive but i'm going to do it anyway
i'm going to lump the uneducated adult
population in
and say are they better off
could could you make the case that
making sure
more of that that group voted and again
this has nothing to do with race
i'm going to talk about race in a moment
but for now we're just talking about
people who are uneducated and poor
and there are lots of them of all types
do we get a better result
because people who are the most easily
duped got to vote
and i don't think you would doubt that
would you well no that's not true maybe
senior citizens are
as easily duped and they do vote so
that's
i guess that's a problem too all right
so i think we should at least
test the theory that the republic form
of government is better than the other
kind
because letting everybody vote even if
they weren't really that interested and
not that informed
it's not really the republic model as
much as it is
a straight democracy model and we should
decide which one we like better
um let me ask you this
do you think that poor and i guess the
poor part is irrelevant to the question
but
let's say under-educated people do you
think
under-educated people should make their
own
legal and medical decisions now of
course they can
that's their right are some advantages
of that right
but do you think that the uneducated
person who goes into their doctor
and the doctor says well you've got a
bad case of x
and here are the pills that will take
care of it two weeks you'll be all set
definitely you have x definitely these
pills are going to make you better
here you go should the poor person just
say you know i don't know medicine i
think i'll just take your advice
would they be better off with that
because the doctor doesn't necessarily
have your best
interests in mind right it's still sort
of up to you to make your decisions
that's the way the system works
but i think a uneducated person who is
uneducated about let's say
medical science might want to just take
the advice of the person who has their
interests
in mind at least enough of their
interest in mind
how about should an uneducated
uneducated person make their own
complicated legal decisions
why not why not just because they don't
know how
why would that stop them it's their
right and the answer is
no they shouldn't they should wait for a
real lawyer to give them some advice
and then they might make some decisions
about whether they want to take the
advice
but you want somebody smart to help you
with the hard stuff
right that's why we have a republic to
send the smart people up to do the
things that we're not going to get into
the details on
ourselves all right
that's enough on that um
then let's talk about the the racial
part here's the part that's missing
that i wonder why it is so the
assumption here is that the georgia
voting rules will disenfranchise
and or reduce the at least the
percentage
of black voters and that could change
the entire outcome of the election
so it's important and i ask you this
do do we win or lose elections
based on the percentage of a racial
group
that voted for you is that how our
system works
oh you got elected because you got you
got the greatest percentage of a
specific
racial group like if that's not the
system the system is just the greatest
number
right whoever gets the most votes
it's not a percentage it's whoever gets
the most
we just compare two sets of votes which
one's bigger that's the whole system
but we're talking about like percentages
of this group and
percentages that we should check
ourselves every once a while
and here's a question i haven't seen
answered
are there more poor white people
who don't have ids or poor black people
now as a percentage it's not even close
percentage-wise i think it was like 25
percent
of black american citizens don't have
regular id
now i don't believe that's true but it
is a statistic i saw
i have trouble believing it's 25 i can't
believe it's even close to that actually
if i had to guess that put it closer to
10 or 15
just it just feels like you couldn't
possibly be 25
but again uh if you're if you're not
close to that population maybe you just
don't see it it could be just invisible
to people like me
so here's the question why are we
talking about the percentage
of black people that aren't voting
shouldn't we talk about
the number of people who are not voting
no matter
what they are does that is that really
the important part
the you know the percentage of a racial
group
now i get i get the point right you'd
want every group to be
represented but we don't have a
constitution that requires that
where in the constitution does it say
that among
ethnic groups there should be similar
rates of voting
the reason it's not part of the
constitution is it wouldn't be a good
idea
even if you could do it easily i just
don't know that that would be a good
idea
maybe the people who vote should be the
ones who care
and are well informed and as well as
they can be
um here's here's an interesting comment
all right so andrew on youtube he has
this comment
he says i'm a black immigrant and know
plenty of poor black people
he says i've never met anyone who
doesn't have an id
so there's a you know a black adult
immigrant in the united states who knows
lots of
poor black people doesn't know anybody
doesn't have an id
have you ever met anybody who doesn't
have an id now part of the problem is
maybe you just don't meet the people who
don't have ids
like the people who don't have ids
probably meet each other
and the people who do have ids probably
meet each other
but i can't tell you the last time i had
a conversation with somebody who even
might not have an id you know somebody
whose situation is so
so bad in society that you could
reasonably think
i'm not even sure this person has an id
when was the last time you had a
conversation with
anybody like that right
probably not um
and so i'm not sure that just because
you haven't met any that that's telling
you much
however to the point that there was a
stat that said that something like 25
percent of black americans don't have id
that couldn't possibly be true could it
could it i mean i'd really like to know
if it's true
because if it's that high that does
change my opinion on the whole topic
right it's one thing to say which i am
saying
i don't think there's a constitutional
reason that percentages of voting need
to be equal
it's just not in the constitution but
at the same time if 25 of black
americans can't vote because they don't
have ids
that's way too big that's so big you got
to do something about it right
like if it were a small problem you just
say ah you know
but a big problem if it's true so i
guess
we don't have the fact check on that in
a way that i
believe it but what i would like to see
in the number that's missing is the
number of
uh white people just the number the raw
number
compared to the raw number of black
americans
who don't have id and therefore can't
vote
which one is bigger which number is
bigger
because i don't believe the 25 number
but but do you think there are more
raw numbers of white people who are poor
and can't vote because of id or more um
somebody says you're a racist you don't
understand
so somebody's calling me a racist in the
comments a typical thing
first of all you may have missed the
story that i self-identify as black now
i am allowed to do that and i take that
right as my own so first of all i can't
be a racist
because i self-identify as black so
that's the first thing
second thing is uh i'm not only not
racist
i'm pro-black super
pro-black in fact i've spent quite a bit
of time and
my own money trying to make the world
better for
specifically for black people and you've
seen me do it i've
done quite a bit of work even in public
now
um so so first of all it's not possible
right so by definition you can't be a
racist
in this country if you're black and
that's one of the reasons that i
self-identify as black so that i don't
have that problem
and some of you are
i know what some of you are saying right
now some of you are saying
i think this is a gag right you're not
really
self-identifying as black are you that's
just a joke right
nope nope it's not a joke
i'm literally self-identifying as black
i do have black dna
so i don't know how much you need but
the rules say that you can self-identify
i don't make the rules i'm just and i've
told you before
one of the most persuasive things you
can do is follow the rules
exactly as they're written i am
following the rules
exactly as they're written exactly
and if that changes the rules
well maybe the rules weren't good but
don't blame me for following the rules
i'm going to follow them sincerely if
that makes anything bad for you
well you'll have to deal with that um
let's talk about north korea bad
persuasion
so here is the position of the biden
administration and they're not the first
ones to have this position
but think about how stupid this is
these are actually elected politicians
who are theoretically they're capable of
doing stuff like this
and here's the american position that
before we are willing to negotiate with
north korea
their leader has to agree in advance to
a humiliating defeat in the negotiations
in advance we won't negotiate to you
until you agree to lose the negotiations
in this context it means agree in
advance
to give up nuclear weapons now
is that a reasonable thing to ask is
that a reasonable position
because who is it that wants to nuke you
in the first place
i'll tell you who wants to nuke us
people who insist that they lose
before we're willing to talk to
them
yeah they should nuke us maybe because
we're acting like we deserve to get
nuked
if anybody ever deserved to get nuked it
would be a country that says yeah we'll
only talk to you if you agree to a
humiliating defeat
before the first word is spoken
that's not smart what did trump
do instead trump said
if you make a move in our direction we
will wipe you out
but we'd love to talk how'd you like to
get together
compare those two they are not even
close in terms of the right approach
persuasion-wise one of them is
obviously the dumbest thing
you've ever seen in your life
we'd love to negotiate with you because
it's very important to both of us
and if we don't negotiate with you there
could be a nuclear war
that's how important it is to negotiate
with you now
having established that it's a vital
planetary
importance here's how we're going to
approach it
we're not even going to talk to you
until you agree to lose and not only
lose
you have to lose the most important
thing in a
visible very high visible humiliating
way
so that's our opening position are you
serious
can we get any dumber how could that
possibly work
now i heard a hypothesis this morning
that i kind of liked i'm going to toss
it down here and see what you say
speaking of tossing it's uh the the
username on twitter who came
who suggested this uh
i i don't know if i want to read his
name in public but it's on twitter so
i'll just read it so it's user named
fudge tosser
and he tweets this about
our opening position of negotiations
with north korea
and when i point out that it's an
impossible ridiculous
failing and advanced position to say you
have to lose before we start
this user says and listen to this it's
actually
a good hypothesis he says it's
intentional
in other words we're intentionally with
north korea is not strategically
desirable
huh and then he goes on he says
uh it gives us an excuse to keep forces
in the neighborhood
huh that's not about it that's not a bad
hypothesis is it
because it would explain why we would be
doing something so stupid in public
usually you try to hide your stupid
stuff right but why would we be so
stupid in public for so long
this is not a bad hypothesis that we're
literally
not trying to have peace with north
korea because if we did we wouldn't have
an excuse to keep forces there
on the border of china basically or near
it
and um
and then this user went on to say that's
why john bolton sabotaged
trump's peace summit by going on tv just
before it and saying the libya model was
one way of dealing with the north
which did sort of sabotage things
and maybe john bolton was just thinking
the last thing we want is to take
forces out of south korea at a time when
china is militarizing the area
and i said to myself that's not bad
as a hypothesis is it that's not bad
because we probably do want some kind of
military presence
uh in that area as china is rising and
you know very military uh
let's say they seem to be indicating a
high military interest
in controlling the whole area
interesting i'll just put that out there
what do you think
somebody says good it's a good strategic
move
um it's a good strategic move under the
under the assumption that they don't
nuke us
accidentally nuke us or sell the nukes
to somebody who would or
sell the technology to somebody who
would
so it's definitely dangerous but maybe
there is a strategic reason
you never know
i keep asking this question and maybe
this is also something that somebody
smarter can explain what do you think
given that china is by far our biggest
you know future
challenge wouldn't you think that we
should be working on a military alliance
with
russia instead of having a military
alliance nato against russia
shouldn't we be looking to have a
military alliance
with russia because how else would china
be
you know kept in check because just
their
their pure size would suggest that if
you
fast forward 50 years china owns
everything
so it seems to me that we should be
smarter because the one thing i like
about putin
are you allowed to say that you know i
guess i'll have to say he's a murderous
dictator
and he's all bad but there is one thing
that makes him useful from the
perspective of
the united states which is he's a
pragmatist
you kind of know exactly what putin
wants all the time
right you know when he does something
provocative with with syria or whatever
we don't wonder why he's doing it
it's like oh you want warm water parts
and
blah blah so he's completely transparent
and operates more like
a more like a crime family boss
meaning you can make a deal with him and
so he's not he's not based on you know
some religious or dogmatic thing he's
just
doing what's good for him doing what's
good for russia so i feel like that's
exactly the guy you can work with
right now that doesn't mean he wouldn't
try to put one over on us even if we
were
on the same side etc but every now and
then you have to check your assumption
you know you wake up in the morning and
you realize that russia and the united
states have nuclear weapons pointed at
each
at each other why
why why
well we have ours pointed at them
because theirs are pointed at us
and theirs appointed us because ours are
pointed at them
but neither of us have a real reason do
we i think there might have been
in the past but i don't think there is
one now
and indeed the biggest i would think the
biggest threat for both russia and the
united states
would be a rising china to me it seems
like
obvious we have to go this way like
necessity will push us together in the
future
so why not just do it now like like
let's skip
10 years of being enemies because we're
gonna end up on the same team
i just feel like there's no way around
it just like world war ii
right in world war ii there wasn't any
question
we're gonna be sort of on the russian
team against the nazis
and it looks to me i'm not comparing
china to the nazis
they both had concentration camps in
which they put
ethnic minorities to eradicate them in
genocide but i'm not comparing them
i'm not comparing them they do have a
little similarity but i'm not comparing
them
all right um so
here's something i'd like to point out
there was a
survey if you can call it that that the
chicago council on global affairs
published
and they're asking americans about their
attitudes about china
and they the way they do it they ask the
question is they have this
thing they call the feeling thermometer
question
allowing responses on a hundred pound
scale ranging from very warm
and that would be a favorable feeling
about china of 100
to very cold which would be zero nearly
1200 americans came back with an
average response that was well according
to this article
freezing at 32. so in terms of
um and it looks like that's at an
all-time low
or at least i don't know it looks pretty
low
and here's the thing i'd like to point
out do you remember
back in 2016 i was telling you that
trump
was very persuasive do you remember that
and people said to me well where's all
his persuasion
you're saying he's so persuasive but
show it to me
where's his persuasion where is it let's
see him persuade me he's not persuading
me i don't see any persuasion
he spends four years telling you that
china is the biggest problem in the
world
and then then a survey comes out that
suggests that americans think china is
the biggest problem in the world
that was trump now
i've said this before um now i'm
that's not to say there aren't plenty of
um china hawks you got your
tom cottons your you know your changs
your gordon changs etc
so there are plenty of high-profile
people who are also
um you know railing against china but
they don't have the same skills
and i believe that they wouldn't have
moved the needle you know
a uh gordon chang tom cotton
are excellent in terms of command of the
facts and
and being smart about how they think of
it in a practical way
you know highest level thinking and
knowledge
what i don't see in either one of them
specifically persuasion skills
the way i see it in trump trump is a
persuader
he will change your mind tom cotton
might tell you something you didn't know
gordon chang will tell you something you
didn't know
maybe frame it a new way but i don't
know
if he has the persuasive specific skills
like like trump does now i told you
before
that there's a weird thing i've been
tracking for a long time
which is that whenever i'm involved in
persuading anything
it always goes my way and i can't tell
if i just am good at picking the right
topic
so maybe i'm just good at picking the
right side and
then my team wins but it's only because
i was on the right side it wasn't
because i made any difference
but i don't think there are too many
regular citizens
who have persuaded with actual
persuasion tools
against china more than i have since
2018.
i'll bet you if you looked at a graph of
feelings about china
you would see that in 2018 when my
stepson died
of fentanyl overdose which i blame on
china
i think you would see that around 2018
there's a fairly sharp
change in the opinion of china i don't
know that
but i'll bet you'd find it and it
wouldn't be an
accident just putting it out there
let's talk about that big old ship
that's stuck in the suez canal
which is weirdly interesting it's way
more interesting than
i think and here's the question
i would ask you because i'm a little bit
obsessed about the engineering to get
that thing out of there
can you string tugboats together
how many tugboats could you string
together
because it seems to me um let's see if i
can
if i can do this with you let's see
let's say this
phone here is the boat the ship
and it's it's going let's say it's uh
let's say it's going forward which will
be up in my example
and then it gets turned sideways and it
gets wedged
now the front part of the wedge
presumably would be deep into the sand
and it looks like they're trying to dig
it dig out the front
the back is also on the bank but i would
think that the bank
maybe isn't dug in so much on the back i
would think the front
because it like dug in is probably way
in there
so getting the front out seems hard
getting the back out seems easier and i
feel like they're working on the front
so that's the first thing i'd ask
is are they working on the right side
the second thing i'd ask
is how many ships and or tugboats
can you string together to increase the
power of them all
is there a limit because the limit might
be you know that the
i know the the chain at the end would
break or something
because there wouldn't be enough but it
seems to me
that you could chain enough boats and
maybe you could throw in a
you know throw in another freighter in
there to get the weight
right and just pull on that thing from
the back
i wouldn't try to get the front out i
think that's a mistake
i would pull on the back because that's
probably wedged in the least
and if you get the back out i think you
can you the front will come out
that's my guess so i'm just going to put
that out there it's just an engineering
question
why can't you just string a bunch of
tugboats together until you have enough
of them
like how many would it take because
presumably
you would have unlimited resources to do
this right
and there must be you know ton of
tugboats in there
get a hundred of them somebody said blow
it up
i think the problem is that the cleanup
would take as long as getting it out of
there
all right um
rutgers university is going to require
uh vaccinations to go back to in-person
classes
we will expect a lot more of that i
would expect that traveling will require
vaccinations
at least some kinds of traveling i'm
thinking schools will
require it because the teachers unions
will just say
got to do it or else we won't go to work
i feel as if
society will have enough places that you
have to be vaccinated
that a lot of people who wouldn't have
gotten it are going to say ah
i still want to function in society i
want to go to my gym
so might as well do it
i think that's the way it's happening um
now as i mentioned earlier i identify as
black now and dr interracial
on twitter who's probably watching this
right now hello doctor
uh held up a copy of my and by the way
dr interracial is exactly what it sounds
like it's an interracial marriage
one of them is a doctor apparently uh i
don't know which one
this is the doctor but um there's a
doctor interracial
and let's say that it's the the husband
i'm not sure that's the case but
he held up my uh my book had a failed
almost everything and he tweeted
my my new favorite self-identified black
author
now it's as i said it's a black man
who's
doing this tweet and uh
i think it's working now part of that
tweet thread asked why i can't be
or should i be on the new york times
best-selling black authors list
i didn't know such a thing existed but
apparently the new york times has a
special car mount a little best-selling
list just for black authors
and uh dr interracial and his wife are
asking
why am i not on it shouldn't shouldn't
my books be on that list
well maybe at the moment they're not
selling enough but in theory
what would make me ineligible for that
list would the new york times get to
would they be the ones who get to
identify my race
because that's not their rule right if
you ask the new york times how does
it work is it you the new york times who
gets to say what
ethnicity i am or or racial makeup or do
i get to say that
i think they would agree that i get to
say it right
i'm not joking if you ask the new york
times
would they not agree with me that the
individual gets to
identify the way they want to be that's
right i'm not making that up so by their
own rule
would i not be eligible for the new york
times best-selling black authors list
and if i'm not how do they explain that
now if they explain it because they
think i'm just joking
let me say again i'm not i'm not i'm
following a real rule
because it advantages me if you live in
the united states and there's a
a real rule you know that everybody
agrees with it doesn't have to be the
law per se
but everybody agrees with it you can use
the rule
it's available to everybody there's no
rule that says i can't use the rule
because then it would be useless if you
can't use it
um
right they'd be racist for admitting
omitting me based on their own
definition of things
um now as i told you before one of the
best ways to change
rules you don't like is to use them
and adhere to them strictly so here
you you're watching me do it i've given
you examples before where i've broken
systems
this is a good hypnosis persuasion trick
you can break any system
by following its rules the only way any
system works is if people are bending
the rules all the time
because there's very rarely can you make
a system that works for all situations
so the only way you can make it work at
all is to be
doing a lot of bending the rules and all
the strange situations nothing almost
nothing
is the exception to that so if you want
to break
a societal rule follow it
and don't make the exception just follow
it
and it will break on its own
um yeah you know there's interesting
news on the dna part about the
neanderthal
genes apparently the neanderthal genes
can tell you a lot about your likelihood
of a bad
covet response but it's not as clean as
if you have it or don't i guess there's
some subcategories within the
within the category that could make you
good or bad based on
on that all right let's talk about
vitamin d there's a
new meta study with uh 50 different
studies that
overwhelmingly show overwhelmingly like
overwhelmingly the studies are all on
the same side
that if your vitamin d level is good
uh you'll have better outcomes with the
coronavirus and
by a lot now most of the studies are
just showing the correlation
so you got to be careful correlation
doesn't mean causation
and it also doesn't mean that if you
just took
more vitamins you would necessarily be
better off but i think it's a good bat
so i do take d3 so i take vitamin d
just because the risk is zero but the
upside might be life and death
so of course i take it but i don't know
if the thing i get over the counter
makes any difference
there's some suggestion that maybe it's
you know
could be good but it's not a big big
thing
the thing i'd worry about here is
that the correlation is fooling us
because it is true that
people who are unhealthy in general for
whatever reason
if they're unhealthy for any reason they
almost always have low vitamin d
so since unhealthy people are who the
people who die of covet
it could be just a coincidence that they
also have low vitamin d
but it's a strong enough correlation
and the risk of taking it is so low
that i think you'd be literally just
stupid
not to try to supplement your your
vitamin d given that it has other
benefits that are more
more obviously true according to science
so get your vitamin d
but um i don't know that that's you know
like the magic bullet or anything like
that
all right how many of you
oh let me let me uh get a i'll give you
a lead into this one
um there was a user named peter
online who in one of the twitter
conversations
mentioned two bad things about president
trump
the fine people hoax and the drinking
bleach hoax
except poor peter didn't know both of
them are hoaxes
and then poor peter had the bad luck of
running into user
magician and magician
uh quite courteously
showed him the transcript of the fine
people hoax to know that it was a hoax
and then the transcript of the the
drinking bleach oaks
to see that he never said drinking
bleach he always talked about light and
that's all a hoax
now what do you think peter did
when he realized because it's not you
could just read it right
he doesn't have to wonder if he was
wrong you should read it it's obvious he
was wrong
what do you think he did did he say whoa
whoa i was not aware of these facts
and now that you have informed me and i
can see the transcripts
i change my mind those are no those are
no true stories at all
those are hoaxes do you think that
happened
with peter no
because it never works facts
are completely unpersuasive and always
will be once you learn that
you understand the world if you think
that facts can change somebody's mind on
politics
you haven't been paying attention
because it doesn't
so um
so after that uh i weighed in myself
and i noted in my tweet the poor peter
and i used narrator voice narrator
this was the moment that peter realized
he had been
double rupard double rupard
now you all know that being a rupard is
based on
vox writer aaron rupar i think that's
his first name
r-u-p-a-r and it became an actual word
in the urban
dictionary it may have been removed by
now but it was in there
as someone who passes around
um edited videos that are misleading
and does it intentionally and so i said
that poor peter had been double rhubarb
two hoaxes now i'm gonna
i'm gonna re-emphasize something i said
before because i didn't think i
said it well enough as i thought about
it and it goes like this
words carry persuasion
now you kind of knew that but i'm gonna
i'm gonna
add a little to it which is that every
word is like a little
unit of logic or persuasion i guess you
could say
better better to say persuasion they're
not necessarily logical
but words carry their own logic and
reasons
and explanations just by being a word
and so if you can create a word like
being rubard
you can imbue it with a credibility that
it never
earned because words do that they just
absorb
things like credibility they absorb lack
of credibility
a different word they absorb things
that they don't earn and there's no
logic to it they just absorb them
so by creating an official word for this
you let the word absorb the credibility
that it doesn't earn
and it makes your your persuasion better
simply because there's a word that you
and the person you're talking to have
both heard
to describe this thing so that's why i'm
pushing the rupard thing
so much not because it's funny and it
you know makes makes fun of this one
individual
but because you actually are creating a
packet of persuasion
that can just sort of live there forever
after i leave
like if if the rupar things stayed as a
general reference i could walk away
and it would just stay there as being
persuasive forever
so words are packets of persuasion think
of them that way
um here's another
uh hoax how many of you have followed
the
nexium sex cult story
most of you know what that is right uh
keith renery is in jail right now for
unrelated things had nothing to do with
being a
cult specifically but just things he was
accused of and convicted of
um but how many of you think it's true
that there was such a thing as a sex
cult
now some of you know that there was a a
subgroup associated
with nexium but wasn't nexium per se but
some of the same people
and they had a subgroup called das uh
doesn't matter what it means and that
that subgroup had up to 100
women i think only who um
some of them agreed to get a brand
now when you hear that you say well
that's a cult
and some number of them had a personal
uh physical relationship with the leader
keith rineri but it was a consensual
well-understood relation set of
relationships
what nobody was forced to do anything
now you say to yourself
but what about the what about the brands
if somebody's in a group then scott
scott scott i know you're not calling
them a cult
but if they're getting branded
they're in a cult well let me give you
some details
when you heard that they got branded
what did you think of
you thought of a branding iron didn't
you and you thought it was like
like cattle and then somebody put it
over the
hot coals and it was glowing for a while
then somebody held down the person
and they were like
and there's like the smell of burning
flesh
might be a little fire coming up off of
it like in your mind it's pretty
it's pretty bad right well it wasn't
exactly a branding iron
it was a cauterizing pen
it was a cauterizing pen
which apparently is not that uncommon
for people who get tattoos to get this
treatment
because it's actually closer to a tattoo
than it is to branding a cow
it's closer to a tattoo and it ends up
with a little bit of a scar tissue that
you can barely see
that's it now is that the way you heard
it
when you heard that the women were being
branded
and do you remember seeing pictures of
the brand
how big were the the pictures of the
brand
well if you look at the picture this
looks pretty scary
that's a it was a pretty big brand but
you never saw the whole person did you
you only saw close-ups of the brand
didn't you you never saw the person
so you could see the size of the brand
little thing
it's just a little thing
so so just know that you've been
manipulated
to think that they were branded like
cattle
no they had the option of having a
little
tattoo like brand you could call it a
brand
because it you know disturbs the skin in
a semi-permanent way
and or you could call it permanent that
would be a better description
um and they did it because they wanted
to it was just
part of the things that were offered
some said yes
some said no that's it
now does that sound like a cult 100
people
they had this option some said yes some
said no
does that sound like a cult but that's
not the only definition of a cult
one of the definitions would be that
you're not allowed to leave
did that apply to anything in nexium or
in dos the subgroup nope
no people did leave people joined
people left the the definition of a cult
is he can't leave and the people left
were they
were they uh punished no
they just left because it's voluntary
you could join
or you could leave and and by the way
there's no evidence
that they couldn't leave nor was there
any
court case about them being a cult
in other words the courts didn't deal
with the question of are you a cult or
not because that's not a law
there is not illegal to have a cult if
they had been one
now what is the other definition of a
cult the other definition is that the
cult members are
cut off from the rest of the world they
can't have contact
don't want them to get any bad ideas in
their head
was that the case with either the nexium
or the dos
not really they did have a a secrecy
agreement that you had to agree to
before you joined
and part of that was this collateral
thing where you had to give them
something embarrassing
to prove that you weren't going to be
talking about the the group
because if you were talking about the
group it wouldn't sound good to other
people and it's just not good
so you want to have a private group and
part of the
mechanism for that as they say give us
some embarrassing
things about you that if you talked you
know would be dangerous
now they never released any of it and
people did in fact leave
but there was never any you know
intention of releasing any of it
because it wasn't a blackmail operation
it was part of the
psychological buy-in process now when
you say to me
scott i think you're being a little
facile here
if somebody gives you blackmail material
and you're supposed to do something or
else
it'll be used that's just blackmail
isn't it
aren't you aren't you trying to spin
this a little too hard
well no
no because it was just a bunch of people
doing what they wanted to do
nobody was ever punished for anything if
anybody had
ever been punished for anything
then you'd have a pretty good case oh
yeah if they tried to talk to the
outside world they got punished that
never happened
if they tried to talk to the outside
world they'd be ostracized
well the the only secrecy was about you
know the group itself
what other group has secrecy
well how about alcoholics anonymous the
anonymous is
right in the name it's not unusual
for groups that are voluntary groups to
want to stay anonymous
it's probably i don't know hundreds
thousands of them
right how about the masons
do the masons have some secret things
that they
they tell you you can't tell the outside
world yeah
but it's all a voluntary group and they
can be there or not be there they can
leave or come
so here's my point
there's no evidence that's ever been
presented
that nexium or the subgroup dos
met any of the qualifications of a cult
and yet probably every one of you
believed that that was a cult
it didn't meet any of the definitions
nor did any court rule on it it wasn't
even a question
there were just some specific
allegations that might have been true
and they might have been false
but that was the subject of the court
case so
when you say it was a cult
it's a hoax it's just another hoax
somebody says aa is not a cult no i'm
not saying that aa is a cult i'm saying
that
i'm saying the opposite of that i'm
saying that alcoholics anonymous
is not a cult but they do have that
secrecy thing
because it just has a function there's a
purpose to secrecy
it's useful right so that's my whole
point is that
alcoholics anonymous is not a cult
just because they have secrecy nor would
the dos
be a cult just because they had secrecy
that's a fairly common thing
businesses have secrecy right businesses
say don't tell anybody our
our intellectual property secrets
secrets is nothing
that's not anything about a cult
all right um
somebody saying the dnc is a cult
well i've written that uh the democratic
and um republican party
are evolving to become a cult because
you know remember the definition of a
cult is that you can't leave without
being ostracized
if you were a republican and you left to
join the democrats
would you have a penalty yeah you would
you would have a penalty if you left
your political party
the the people you left would be pretty
pretty bad pretty mad and they would
probably make you pay
so that means the definition of a cult
right the definition of a cult is you'll
be punished if you leave the group
how about being cut off from the rest of
the world
cnn yeah the the democrats have created
a media enterprise that effectively
cuts them off and if they watched
imagine being a democrat
and your your family they're all
democrats
and you're the only one home at the
moment you turn on the tv and you say
i think i'll give this fox news a try
i think i'll just give it a try nobody's
looking i'm a democrat but i'll just
give this fox news a little try i'll
just
sample it and then you start watching it
you say
wow the production values are pretty
good
oh i kind of like this host oh these are
some facts i hadn't heard before
this is a point of view i had i had
never seen
and you're happily you're a democrat and
you're happily noticed that
you could guess something out of fox
news and you're watching
and then your family comes home and they
see you sitting there watching fox news
and you're all super democrats but
you're sitting there and you got caught
fox news it's on right in front of you
how does that go
how does that go do you have a good day
after that
or did they mock you until you will
never
look at that channel again they will
mock you
until you never watch that channel again
you won't even watch it when you're
alone
yeah does that meet the definition of a
cult
it's exactly the definition of a cult
that they keep you from other
information
aggressively they punish you if you
leave
true right
and and they create a they create a
narrative
that is disconnected from reality
do they do that yes they do
the definition of a cult is met exactly
by the two political parties not one
more than the other
not one more than the other hear that
clearly
in terms in this one way just in this
one way
they are identical you can't leave them
easily without some kind of penalty
they keep you from the other information
and they have a narrative of the world
that is disconnected
in some ways from the real world now i
know that the republicans are saying
well
but the republican narrative is closer
to truth
and the democratic is closer to crazy so
that's not the same and
i feel that too right
like i do feel that the republican
conservative
let's say systems are more complete
they they consider human motivation
especially
so they seem more realistic but i would
argue that they're only more
functional they're not necessarily a
better picture of
reality and that both of them are
probably a little disconnected from
reality
because humans can't see reality we're
not designed to see reality
we're designed to create a subjective
picture of reality
that we treat as reality that's what
we're designed for
so to say that the republicans are the
ones who get it right
and the democrats are the ones that get
it wrong is to misunderstand
the nature of reality because you don't
know what's right and wrong
and you don't know what's reality but
you can tell
what works and i do believe that the
republican
slash conservative set of ideas
are far more functional and that they
work
and you can implement them over and over
again and then
observe that they work for example
competition
it's hard to think of any situation
where you introduced
real competition and it didn't make the
thing better
right it's pretty consistent so in that
way
the the republicans are more let's say
they have more of a passing association
with
reality than democrats because they have
a narrative that isn't real i would say
that republicans
like all humans have have narratives
that are not real
but one of them you works like one of
them consistently is repeatable
and one of them consistently fails every
time you do it
that's the difference all right
um but i just in case anybody's new to
my
new to my broadcast here
i'm left to bernie but better at math
meaning that i'm not
i'm not wed to any policies of either
group
i look at them individually and look for
what's practical
and a lot of the democratic stuff is
just great ideas
that are not practical all right
that i believe represents the totality
of the magic and majesty
of coffee with scott adams i don't think
it could have been better
i think you'd agree maybe it gets better
every single time
i don't want to say that i don't want to
jinx it but it feels like it gets better
every time
and if you learn something today
oh my goodness somebody says mike
lindell is starting a new web platform
wouldn't that be interesting do you know
what mike lindell should call
his new web platform i don't know if
it's like a social media platform or
whatever
he should call it pillow
am i right am i right no maybe it's
taken so we can't use it but if he
started a social media platform
mike lindell it should be named
just one word because you don't want to
be like the facebook
you just want to be facebook you don't
want to be the twitter
you just want to be twitter and you
don't want to be my pillow
you just want to be pillow
you see you're trying to dress it up
with pillow talk
i get it pillow talk is clever it's
catchy
but here's my well let me ask you
let's do a branding survey we're here
we're helping
mike lindell i don't know if he needs
any help but
uh if you had a choice
of uh just pillow
for the name of your social media
network or anything with pillow extra
like pillow talk pillowcase my pillow
which one's better the pillow
all right let me give you a lesson on
branding
here's the first lesson almost everybody
is bad at it
that's why you need to know almost
everybody
probably 99 of the world is really
really bad at this kind of a decision
um so i'm looking at your answers and
you can see they're all over the place
yeah they're all over the place but
there are quite a few people who are
saying the pillow by itself i think i
may have led the witness here
i may have influenced you but yeah
pillow is right
and you'll see lots and the reason the
pillow is right
is that it fits the form better
if you're in if you're an experienced
internet user and you hear
that there's a network called pillow
talk
or you hear that there's a network
called pillow
which one do you assume is more
competently built
pillow mean you might not be right
but your subjective feeling if you're an
experienced
uh experienced internet user you would
recognize the name just pillow
to be put together by people who knew
what they were doing
am i right that you would reckon and
how about this just the people who are
really
really uh part of the internet like
you're a real digital native
you know you really spend some time
maybe you've worked on a startup
maybe you've even been involved with
technology if you're really in that
world
and you hear that it's the one word
pillow you will think that more capable
people are working
on that that's my hypothesis
all right um
sounds like zillow yeah and it's like i
said it's
it's probably already trademarked
there's probably enough things named to
pillow that you couldn't use it but it
would be great
it'd be great if you could a red pillow
oh damn it that's good red pillow
red pillow is pretty darn clever
but i would still call it pillow and
then i might have like
features within it or subcategories or
groups and maybe one of them could be
red pillow that would be
that would pretty pretty great all right
that's all for now i'll talk to you
tomorrow
all right youtubers you got me for
another minute
um today i posted on my
locals channel how to deal with impose
imposter syndrome i think it just posted
i had it scheduled
imposter syndrome and how to have better
self-esteem
and the day before i had posted some
tips on dealing with criticism that
people are telling me
is the best thing i've ever done i don't
know if that's true but
people are really really happy about it
a lot of people saying it's life
changing
uh how do you make a billion dollars
it's easy start with two billion
and buy a boat you see i combined two
old jokes there
um why are you so infatuated with nexium
i think it's interesting on every level
because nexium is a
uh i connect to it on a whole bunch of
levels
one is that it's a persuasion
story so that's that's my sweet spot
the other part is that it's a fake news
story
my other sweet spot and the other part
of it
is maybe the thing that interests me the
most
which is uh i've told you that i spend
and always have since i was young uh if
i find somebody who has accomplished
somebody
or assists can't talk for a second
if i see somebody who is very successful
or very capable i love to dig in and
find out why
like what are you doing what's your
technique what are you doing that works
and then the keith renery situation
at least looking from the outside
because we can't know too much about
what happened there but from the outside
it appears that he had
uh an unusual skill set and i'm very
interested to know it could i learn
anything
from that right you don't have to use
your powers for
for evil right if you if you think
that's what happened
um but having power is power so i would
say that
uh and i'll tell you something that
sounds horrible
but i do know people who have studied
mind conf and various
you know nazi stuff just to learn
technique
persuasion technique in fact it's fairly
common i would guess that
intelligence people who are involved in
persuasion they've probably all read
you know the nazi propaganda so
it's it's a it's very useful
to just find out what people's technique
is no matter what you think about what
they did with the technique
it's useful to know so there are many
many points of
interest there and then some of you know
that i
um
all right sorry my cat's making things
hard here
um did i defend the indefensible and
clubhouse no i think i'm going to
reschedule that for next week
i'm just having a scheduling issue
best color for persuasion somebody says
what's the best color for persuasion
well it depends on the topic so you want
to match your color to the topic
and to the mood um
that that's the answer so there's no
such thing as one color that's
the right color for all of the different
purposes
at the moment if you were going to put a
button on a website
and you wanted more people to click that
button
i think burnt umber like wins whenever
you compete
so if you do a rapid test where you say
i'm gonna
give people a bunch of different looks
of the same website you know the
everything will be the same except the
color of one button
you will consistently find that people
will push the
burnt or burnt umber you know kind of
the
the bad orange before they will press
other but
other colors so there are some that you
can just test
they get more clicks and it has more to
do with uh
yeah burnt umber it has more to do with
uh
just testing it to find out
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
