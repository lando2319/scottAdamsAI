hello youtube let's see if this works we
had a little technical
difficulty before i'm just going to do
one topic uh
on this one it's about china and it's
based on
a unscientific poll that was done by a
china file
and they talked to 121 people who were
china connected
they were scholars and journalists and
former diplomats etc
and they asked them if they were likely
to visit china
after the pandemic restrictions are off
and
40 percent of them said they probably or
definitely would not
and some of them were concerned about
the safety
being jailed on trumped-up charges
some of them were afraid of uh who knows
what
but i would say that the best way to
take down china
is by the following sentence china
is not safe for business because risk
is different in each domain in the
military risk
means something very different and you
might want to take a big risk in the
military if there's a big reward
or you just have to in your personal
life
you might take risks with your hobbies
and your extreme sports and stuff
and that's common people do that in
their personal life but in the domain of
business
people don't like risk because if you
take a risk in business
and it's a risk everybody knows is a
risk it's a well-known risk
and it doesn't go well what happens
you get fired or you look like an idiot
so once it becomes known or just a
standard
business phrase that china is not safe
for business
in a variety of ways then that should
pretty much put business china out of
business
it will take a while but once other
countries realize that the risk of ip
theft the risk of imprisonment the risk
of them spying the risk of them
getting access to your communications
it's just not worth
doing business in china because these
risks are so well known
if you take a risk that that's not known
and it doesn't work out
well you know nobody's going to fire you
for that
you took a risk it didn't work out
nobody knew but if you
know that working in china
is not safe and it doesn't work out
you get fired this used to be the case
with
uh using ibm equipment
back million years ago when i worked in
the corporate world
it would be said that if you um bought
hardware from ibm
you'd never get fired because it either
works
or ibm comes in and makes it work but
it's always going to work
so you're not going to get fired because
it didn't work ibm will take care of
that
their competition well the competition
might give you a better price
but you don't know for sure it's going
to work because they're not ibm
that was the thinking back then now
things probably have changed
but once that becomes a thing
once it becomes known that something has
a risk
to it it's really chilling in the
business world
and china has gone way beyond the point
where you could say
that way beyond the point where you
could say
that it's safe so that's the point
i would just like to say one other thing
to the people complaining about the
the audio just remember
jesus king is the audio is fine
even when it's not because sometimes
it's not
but i also don't care that so there's
your tip for taking down china
and i wanted to test to see if the
reason i had technical difficulties
before
was because of the content or because of
the technology
so this will be a test of that so that's
how to destroy
china just make it a a well-known fact
that china is not safe for business
which is completely true
completely true so you don't have to lie
about anything and there you are
there's your kill shot for china in
china if you're listening
and i think you might be you really
shouldn't have killed my stepson
with fentanyl you're up there
because i'm coming for you and if you
don't get me first
i'm going to take down your whole
 country so
china is not safe for business and that
is something you're going to see a lot
more of in the next month
and i will talk to you tomorrow
