no Savor that
you don't get to see that until later
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization and
possibly some of the animals
if you'd like today's experience to go
to levels that nobody could even imagine
because it has a whiteboard
did I mention it
a whiteboard
and if you'd like this experience with
the Whiteboard
to be the best thing that ever happened
all you need is a cover of my girl glass
a tanker Chelsea style and a canteen
sugar flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine today the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
well we'll go private here at locals
it's better if you don't ask me to go
private during the middle of the
simultaneous sip save that before or
after is good
well let's talk about the news
it's all light and Breezy and not too
many people died at least in a news
making way probably the same amount of
people died yesterday as every other day
but they were sadly they were not
newsmakers
so my rule about death
if you know you're gonna die anyway
shouldn't you make some news
I mean not bad news you don't want to
kill anybody but you know
do it a little bit interesting
add a little bit of something something
yeah
whatever all right so uh
according to Elon Musk is changing the
name of Twitter
to X
it will be X
let me be the first person to say the
NPC comment are you ready what will the
NPC say
is it x rated
it's X-rated
you ready for that uh what else will the
NPC say
can I can I use it if I don't have an
ex-wife
yeah I will expect that soil and green
is people
that's the important thing all right
apparently there's some god-awful movie
called Oppenheimer
and when I say uh God awful
there are three big criticisms of this
movie
number one it's like three hours long
somebody says three hours long
do you know why movies are three hours
long ever like what what is the reason
that there would ever be a three hour
movie
you know there's only one reason right
no not for the Oscars nope that's not
why
it means that the uh the director has
too much power
that's what it means
a a good tight movie like a 90-minute
movie
usually is because the uh the studio had
the edit power
so they just said we're not going to put
out a three-hour movie that'd be crazy
so they just knock it down to something
you'd actually want to watch
but if you have a really high-end Best
Director ever and maybe some Stars
then the studios has to eat whatever
they produce
so it might be an oscar-worthy
tremendous thing but no way in hell I'm
going to watch it
no way in hell I'm gonna watch another
three hour movie as long as I live this
is my promise
my promise I will never watch another
 three-hour movie do you know how
many times I thought that was a good
idea
quite a few
quite a few
I've fallen for that trick oh dozens of
times I don't know how many three-hour
movies are but I think I've seen them
all
I'm not going to fall for it again I'm
going to take a stand
this could be the best movie ever made I
will not watch it three hours that is
not fair
that is not it's not even respectful
it's not respectful of the audience at
all anyway but that's only one thing
wrong with it I saw an Internet that
this movie doesn't have enough people of
color
and there's no woman speaking and moving
until 20 minutes in
so I mean
yeah I mean you want Morgan Freeman to
be playing Oppenheimer I know you do
but you can't have everything you want
so apparently just because Oppenheimer
was a real person and he wasn't a person
of color that that somehow that seemed
reasoning enough
to make him a white supremacist
now they don't call him a white
supremacist I just assume
because he's white it was just natural
natural assumption so a very big mistake
to make this movie about a real live
white man and they cast a white guy to
play the part it's like ridiculous in
2023.
so the Hill houses a story about a study
in the Lancet
that uh getting a proper hearing aid for
older people can reduce your risk of
Dementia by 48 percent
isn't that amazing
48
difference just getting a proper hearing
aid
now
this fits with everything else we know
about dementia
how many times have you heard that the
people who retire and stop reading books
and stop challenging themselves they
have a worse time of dementia
it's pretty well understood thing and
if you quit your job early this is
actually one of the biggest reasons
that I don't plan to retire
you know until I'm a total embarrassment
because I know that that's the thing
that keeps me alive
the the fact that every day there's
something in my day that I say to myself
oh God I'm gonna have to do a lot of
thinking
like today is one of those days there I
have a very complicated task I have to
do later I have to change my password on
four separate sites
don't ask why it has something to do
with publishing
but do you know how hard it is for me
with the way my brain is wired to change
four passwords which is a simple process
right they'll all have a simple do you
do you know the odds of me doing that
correctly and do you know how long it
will take
an ordinary person changing a password
five minutes
five minutes stops this is an all-day
this is all day for me I have to
actually block out a full day to change
four passwords because I know that of
the four there's no chance that all four
will work
one of them will tell me that I've
already opened an account
and I've used every password that can be
used and I can never use another
password because I've used them all and
by the way
they're not sure that my username is
real anymore
right I mean I'm making that one up but
it feels like you can't do a simple test
like change four passwords all in the
same day
it just somebody's going to send you the
message to to your spam
you're going to look and it won't be
there
and you'll wait and it just will never
be there there's some Services I think
it's open table
I I hope I had an Open Table account for
the app like many years ago but now I
can never use it again
because it gets in that mode where it
thinks you already have an account but
it won't let you in won't let you change
password I forget what it was it was one
of those situations where you literally
you could never use it again
unless you pretend to be somebody else I
guess
anyway
um
so it makes sense to me that hearing
aids would improve your prospects of not
getting dementia because it's just one
more input
so my belief is that the more input
you know the more things coming through
your ears and eyes and senses and you
know your brain and all that that that's
the only thing that keeps you from
getting dementia it's just how much is
going on
and uh so keep that in mind
it's not just the hearing aids it's just
everything you do with your brain
all right well uh oh sad news sad news
it turns out that the Washington poop I
mean the Washington Post The Washington
Post it's only in the Dilbert reborn
comic uh that's called the Washington
poop uh the rapper is actually working
at the Washington poop in the Dilbert
reborn comic which is available only by
subscription if you subscribe on Twitter
or Scott adams.locals.com anyway Jeff
Bezos is uh reportedly he wants to take
a more direct interest in the business
that he owns the Washington Post
uh because they reportedly lose a
hundred million dollars a year
due to failing subscriptions
huh
What would
what would cause a business like the
Washington Post
to lose customers
let's say there they're a news entity
news entity what would make a news
entity lose customers well competition
competition would do it does it look
like there's a lot more competition for
news
not a serious competition there is but
not serious
so it's probably not the competition
well is it because they probably have
very high expenses maybe not no
could it be
that the news entity is more famous for
fake news than real news
could it be that when you think of the
Washington Post
or I say to you well the Washington Post
has a political story today about Trump
what's your first thought oh there's
some useful news fully in context
accurate I'm sure in which I will learn
something that's useful to me as a
citizen in my decision making while I
vote
no no use you tell yourself it's fake
news because it always is you know
depending on the topic it's always fake
news
so you're not going to believe the
science lay report because that's
probably you're not going to
believe any of the politics or the
opinion
what else do you use newspapers for
to find out the same thing that you
could see in a tweet you know there's
something new style of you or something
what else is there
well there's celebrity news news about
public figures
and we'll talk about how often the news
about public figures is accurate because
on a day when the news is talking about
the news
the news about the news is that the
Washington Post is losing a lot of money
wouldn't it be interesting to
be on a live stream that teaches you how
to spot the fake news even better which
would make the Washington Post go out of
business faster
anybody in for that does anybody want to
help me put the Washington Post
completely out of business simply by
teaching you how to better spot fake
news that's all I'll do that's the only
thing I'll do I'll teach you how to
better spot fake news and it should put
the Washington Post completely out of
business you ready
that's coming up I'm going to do the
whiteboard in a little bit but let's do
some other stuff first
uh so I saw a tweet from Owen Greg gory
and about a Newsweek article about
researchers from the University of
Colorado
uh they found about 500 different genes
that directly influence what we choose
to eat
including those involved in our
experience of taste
so it turns out that your genes
will determine what you like and would
also presumably
it makes sense it follows would have a
big impact on who's overweight
for example
I like sweet stuff sometimes in the
right context but I don't like it enough
to seek it I wouldn't look for it yeah
maybe I'd eat it if somebody like forced
me to be polite it's like oh I made this
myself oh did you you made it yourself a
little bit of it in my mouth to show you
that I'm supportive
so I do eat sweet things and sometimes
even like oh that was tasty uh but I'm
not really drawn to it
now I've always believed
that was genetic
because I observe people around me and
you could look at how quickly they they
come to get the food from the moment you
tell the room full of people that the
food is ready
watch you lines up first every time
you'll be the same people if you have
the same set of Friends when the pizza
comes see which friend gets to the pizza
first it'll be the same ones every time
that they they they seem to have a
genetic you know craving or preference
for food that I simply don't have
now some of it is you can train yourself
to get rid of some Cravings especially
for sweets by just staying off them for
a long time if you stay off your sweets
for a long enough time they don't even
look like food anymore
you've probably not had that experience
but if you do stay away from sweets long
enough
it doesn't look like food
you like your brain just redefines it as
oh that's some kind of like
entertainment
right if I want entertainment at you
know some risk to my health well there
it is but you don't see it as food you
see food is food and you see dessert as
entertainment as you should
but uh
I wanted to add to this that science is
finally catching up to where hypnotists
were 40 well actually 50 to 100 years
ago
there are things I learned 40 years ago
in hypnosis class from just a hypnotist
without the benefit of any science that
are just being discovered is true or
have been discovered in my lifetime
in my lifetime
science discovered that alcoholism has a
genetic base
or is anybody here old enough to
remember before that was obvious
did what you didn't know that uh
honestly you didn't know that
uh yeah I think you're kidding right
everybody knows that alcoholism has a
genetic base right
I thought everybody knew that
um so yeah it runs in the family it's
easy to demonstrate it's genetic now
as a hypnotist
I knew that long before science did
because you could just help people who
are you know driven by different desires
and they were not you know they didn't
come from nature people were just driven
by different urges it was obviously
genetic
so that's something you know I knew long
before
when the large language models were
introduced you know the the AI that we
have now
um
and I said what you're going to learn is
about people
you'll learn about AI but AI is going to
teach you more about people and what it
taught us was exactly what I was waiting
for for 40 years
the humans are nothing but pattern
recognition machines it's all we are so
they reproduced our intelligence just
with pattern recognition
if you don't realize that people don't
think
we don't actually reason we just
imagined we do
now I do think there are some non let's
say non-emotional topics
where people can get to something like a
reasoned chain of cause and effect and
you know something closer to science but
in your daily life you don't do anything
like that your daily life is just
pattern recognition and cognitive
dissonance and confirmation bias and
then reinterpreting what you did as
smart after the fact
you do it first and then you tell
yourself it made it there was a reason
you did it that's actually what you
learned in hypnosis
but science is just catching up do you
remember the first time you heard that
there was a part of your brain that
doesn't activate
until after you've decided to do
something like the actual reasoning part
of your brain isn't even involved until
just after you make a decision it's a
rationalizer
all right now science has demonstrated
that that you actually rationalize after
your emotional decision
but hypnotists learn that on this like
day one all right people are completely
irrational everything you think about
people thinking and using reason and all
that complete illusion nobody's using
reason at all
you know except in the limited case of
maybe balancing your checkbook you know
doing some actual science you know
there's some reason there but not in
your daily life in your daily life it's
just patterns and urges and genetics and
stuff like that and their Free Will is
an illusion
by the way if Free Will were not an
illusion I don't think hypnosis would
even work
I don't think it'd be a thing
it's very much a thing
so
so I I could anticipate thanks to
hypnosis training that the large
language models would have a limit
and the limit would be they're not going
to get too much smarter than us
because that's it that's what
intelligence is it's just it's just
pattern recognition
so
uh that was interesting all right now
apparently Apple AI is coming and maybe
sooner than we think uh it it appears
there's a possibility I think this is
unconfirmed the Apple may have done a
lot more work on AI than they've told us
and that may be by Fall you'll see Apple
products coming out with you know uh not
just AI
but some are speculating really really
good AI
because I don't think apple is going to
roll it out unless it beats the out
of the other products would you agree
with that
that probably a probably Apple has had
something that's about as good as chat
GPT for a while I'm just speculating but
guessing they're too smart
to not be have done something right
there's no way they waited until chat
GPT came out I don't believe that
but we do see they didn't put it into
Siri
so you know my guess is that they're
waiting for something that's like a
leapfrog or you know it's a level better
than what you're seeing on the market
just speculating it could be less than
what's on the market
we'll see but it's a big big deal and
it's coming and I will remind you when I
talk about companies you should ask me
if I forget right if I'm talking about
some big company's prospects for the
future you should ask me if I own stock
if I forget to tell you right so I owned
Apple stock until recently for for years
I owned it I got rid of it because of
the AI risk I don't recommend you follow
my advice
because it looked to me like they were
behind on AI but you don't really know
you don't really know it's it's entirely
possible that
um
the Apple will you know triple in value
because of AI
it's also possible that the App Store
model disappears with AI and that
anybody can make a phone
so here's here's the other thing the
other thing I predict
is that we're not that far away from a
phone that's just a screen
and all it does is talk to the internet
and that's about it so basically your
phone would just be what got processed
on the internet and then got sent to
your phone but there wouldn't be any
brains in the phone
so if you lose your phone you go to the
store you pick up another one and you
put in the same password you have it on
the lost phone
and it just pops up it's your phone
to me it seems like that's the future of
phones
and the only thing that would prevent it
would be you know ubiquitous access to
the internet which we now have
a variety of ways
so
so I think there's a existential risk to
Apple
with AI
at the same time if you're going to bet
on you know Apple's performance from the
past being indicative of the future what
would that be
what would you call it if you used the
past performance of a company to predict
the future performance what's that
called there's a word for that
using the past performance of a company
thank you yes the word is stupid stupid
is the the actual tactical term
for imagining that you could predict the
future by the past
you know how uh history repeats
no it doesn't
who the told you history repeats it
can't repeat it doesn't even have the
possibility it's not even one of the
possibilities yeah there's some patterns
that you'll see over and over but
history can't repeat because there's
always a different starting point even
if you put the same pattern into it
you're starting from something new so
you're going to end up with something
new
all right so I don't know what's going
to happen with apple but I think that
the
um the reason I owned a big chunk of it
until recently is that it operated like
an index fund
do you get that it was such a big Stable
Company with so many lines of business
that it could have a really bad time
with any one product
and you know probably they'd be fine
but AI actually takes a risk to a
hundred percent of their product line
in my opinion now again it could be that
the risk
managed properly in an apple way the way
they always do could be the thing that
triples or 10xes their their stock price
but the risk is not like it used to be
right so only a little bit of Apple
probably makes a lot of sense oh
that's advice
yeah the only advice I'd like to give
you is diversification
I feel like that's fair right because
that's what everybody would say is a
good thing so if you're looking at Apple
maybe you think of it in terms of
diversification that's the only thing
I'll say about it now I do own a QQQ
you're an index fund which has Apple is
a big component so I get the secondary
effect either way
so I'm not completely out
all right I saw that uh
CNN's merconish was talking about the
popularity of Joe Biden and saying it
was the second most unpopular president
in modern history Jimmy Carter was the
most unpopular
so what does it tell you
when CNN and subrakash in this case is
talking about Joe Biden being the second
most unpopular president does that tell
you that CNN is in the bag for Biden
no this does not feel like a story they
would have done before
I don't believe they would have done
this
when he was running against Trump or or
a negative story in general
and we also saw that the
uh Jake Tapper interviewed the IRS
whistleblower
did he think you'd ever live to see that
Jake Tapper
interviewed a highly credible
IRS whistleblower
who has the goods on the bidens can you
even imagine that that happened in the
world you live in
the only thing I can conclude is that
CNN has very much decided they don't
want Biden to be the the guy they have
to defend for the next four years
imagine being CNN and saying oh
we're gonna have to defend Biden
while he's just crumbling into dust
we're going to look ridiculous you got
to give us somebody we can defend right
give us give me give us anybody who
looks better than Trump to at least you
know the base
so it does look like the uh all
indications are that the uh Gavin Newsom
Switcheroo is in full play
does anybody think it would be anybody
except Gavin Newsom
can you think of one name
of who the at least you know let's say
the the alleged deep State Democrats who
else would they want to put there
yeah
let me let me make your prediction for
you that I will die on that Hill you
ready
Michelle Obama will never run for
president
never
Michelle Obama will never run for
president
here's another one RFK Jr will never
ever be on the same ticket As Trump
there's no chance of that
and every time I see it on you know on
that on the internet somebody say hey
I've got an idea because everybody
thinks they thought of it
how many of you thought you were the
first ones to think of I got an idea
what if
just stay with me what if Trump picked
RFK Junior as his running mate
how many of you thought you thought of
that for like before anybody thought of
it
no some of you did
it's never going to happen not there's
nothing in our world that could make
that happen
all right
uh but if I'm wrong about it then I will
eat crow
right in front of you and admit my
weaknesses
oh probably not all right
um so yeah it looks like the Democrats
are gunning for the bidens in my opinion
the only reason that Biden wants to be
president is so he can pardon himself in
Islam
I honestly don't see a second reason do
you
because do you believe that Biden thinks
the only way the Democrats can win is if
he runs
no do you think that this is what he
wants to do at his current age
no
no the he he looks like a desperate man
he's acting like he's desperate to stay
out of jail and keep his son out of jail
now
what do you think would be uh president
Trump's main incentive for running for
office
also
to Pardon himself
so
ladies and gentlemen may I
may I let's say humbly suggest
that if you live in a country which is
on the verge of nominating two people
who's at least among their top two
reasons for running for office
are there only way of staying out of
jail
that's what we've done
so congratulations public
we all did that we hey give yourself a
Pat in the back you're part of a system
that elevated the only two people who
shouldn't be running for office right
now in fact you could scour the country
looking for somebody who would be a
worse Choice than somebody running for
president to stay in a jail
now in my opinion
the the Trump charges at least are kind
of trumped up but they're they're still
there
right I I think that they're you know
minor infractions normal person wouldn't
be prosecuted that kind of thing
but they're still there
how in the world did we get ourselves in
this position
ladies and gentlemen
we did this didn't we do do you think
you could really blame the media for
this one
because you know
exactly what's going on with both these
candidates you know you know you did
this intentionally everybody who
answered a poll tweeted about a
preferred candidate if it was either one
of those
I mean not not every one of you
individually obviously but when I speak
about you I mean the public
yeah I I think blaming this one on the
media is going too far
I think I think we got to take this one
I think the public has to accept
that with full full knowledge and
completely conscious
we chose to have a presidential race so
far
in which the two main candidates are
just trying to stay on a jail
that's a real thing
right now I do think it's Trump's best
bet is to get elected and pardon himself
and I don't think he did anything that
should be jailable at least nothing I've
seen
yeah uh well uh the difference between
the two candidates is that Trump has a
second and third reason
right Trump's second and third reason
would be Revenge
let's not pretend that's not part of it
because you and I and some of the others
want that same Revenge
your revenge on the system
if not on individuals right I want
revenge on the voting system
I want revenge on an election system
that is designed not to be credible
it's designed that way
is not designed to be believable is
designed to not be believed because it's
not auditable
fully you know there's lots of lots of
parts that are auditable but it's not
fully auditable and it wouldn't be
impossible to be fully auditable
and we want it to be so it's got to be
intentional
it's got to be intentional our system it
has to be designed to be not credible or
at least to be riggable
you know the same thing
so designer's Destiny I would assume
that given our current design of the
election systems the rigged election is
a guarantee from the design
the design guarantees it it just doesn't
tell you when or how much
so it doesn't necessarily change the
election it doesn't necessarily change
any specific collection
but is guaranteed by Design
is Destiny
all right
here now your lesson on how to identify
um fake news here's a new rule
the the quote
taken out of the middle of a sentence
now I've told you that quotes any kind
of a quote by a famous person a public
figure is usually in a context
so you already do that right if you saw
as one sentence you'd say oh that's
probably out of context
but worse than that
is the few words taken out of a sentence
so it's bad enough that it's a full
sentence taken down of let's say the
paragraphs around it
but you can go to another level and take
just two words
out of a full sentence what are the odds
that if you if you see a report of a
public figure this is the important part
of the public figure not just somebody
you know public figure
and they're being uh demonized on social
media and in the news over two or three
words from a larger sentence
how many times is that going to be real
a few words from a larger sentence
basically never
basically never you want some examples
sure you do
RFK Jr is in trouble for as the hill the
publication the hill says that he used
he said that kovid was quote now this is
the Hills
words that they picked out of his
sentence and the sentence was picked out
of a larger context and the words they
picked out was ethnically targeted so
those are the koi words you said that
that the code was ethnically targeted
what do you think might have been left
out of the sentence I don't know the
answer to this but if but if he said
that the covid was ethnically targeted
is it possible and I don't know I'm just
asking is it possible that he said you
know the way it looks
it acted as if it's ethnically targeted
did the rest of the sentence say it
looks like it it acts that way or the
outcome was as if
those all mean different things same
words
but what is just before them and what
after them completely changes the
meaning
because if you found out that RFK Jr was
simply raising an eyebrow
saying um we should understand why this
affected people in different ethnicities
differently and then he makes a separate
claim that's connected
that the U.S has been investigating
let's say ethnically targeted
um
bio weapons
we should imagine the other the
adversaries would be doing the same
now even if there's no evidence that
anybody ever did any experiments on
ethnically targeted bioweapons
even if there's no evidence
don't you think it might be true
I mean if you if you were in that job
wouldn't it occur to you that it'd be
better if it didn't kill your side
that'd be like right at the top of the
list of things you'd look into you know
it would be a big variable
so
if we observe as RFK Jr points out that
different ethnic groups may have been of
course all data about covet is sketchy
but the data suggests
that maybe some groups had a completely
different experience wouldn't you want
to know more about that in the context
of a world and which probably everybody
who's doing bio weapons research is at
least looking into
ethnically targeted stuff
so
here's the rule
if you see a partial quote
so it's got to be a partial quote taken
out of a sentence so it's not even the
full sentence
it's the person complaining is uh paid
to complain
are the are the people who write bad
stories about RFK Jr's comments are they
paid to complain
yes the writers the writers who work for
an entity that if it didn't support the
side that reads it the most they would
lose all their money
right so if CNN started reporting all
the same things as Fox News they would
go out of business
so there's somebody to make money
from the the story they're putting
forward the narrative right so it's a
partial quote
it's there the people who are promoting
it or making money directly or
indirectly assume there's an e at the
end of make and it involves a public
figure
now the public figure thing is the real
key
right because you don't see this so much
about you know your neighbor
so you did a public figure RFK Jr is
perfect
so they use him as the vessel for which
they you know put their in from
every side and then they blame him for
it
so they make up a bunch of ridiculous
they pick a public figure and they blame
the public figure by taking two words
out of an entire you know conversation
two words
do you think that's ever happened before
are there any other examples in the news
in which somebody took a partial quote
and made something of it well
how about this I saw a tweet just today
coincidentally from Ibrahim Kennedy you
know ibrum Candy because he's uh
CRT and Di and ESG kind of proponent
so does Ibrahim Kennedy make money
from saying provocative things yes
that's his job he writes books he's
abundant so he basically makes money
and then um
the quote is something about a positive
it's about a public figure
right so it's coming from somebody who
makes money
it's about a public figure
in this case DeSantis and Florida so
Florida is like you stand in for a
public figure but it's really DeSantis
so you got your public figure and now
where's the partial quote you ready for
the partial quote
this is uh Ibrahim Kennedy's tweet and
slavers defended slavery by claiming it
was a positive good
yeah the the two words in court are
positive good
uh for black people I don't think
anybody said that
correct me if I'm wrong but he's get
he's putting a quote
positive good around something that
actually nobody said am I right
isn't he using the quote as an example
of what people are thinking he's not
using it as an actual quote am I right I
believe no I believe nobody ever said
those words positive good
now I only know that because I pay
attention
I've read this about this story enough
to know that was never in the story
suppose you didn't know that
wouldn't you assume he's quoting an
actual person
who said slavery was a positive good you
would assume that right
remember what followed the rule
it's a partial quote
it involves a public figure
all right so you're all of your antennas
should have been up
um and then it goes on
as a positive good for black people
today Florida's Board of Education so
now the board of education is sort of a
stand-in for Florida and DeSantis so
it's really about a public figure right
if DeSantis had not been the driver of
it this wouldn't be a thing
um
and then it said that the Board of
Education in Florida approved new black
history standards for
enslaved people and saying that the
enslaved people the black people
developed skills that and here's the
partial quote could be applied for their
personal benefit
sometimes slaves learn things that quote
could be applied to their personal
benefits what do you think the first
part of the sentence was
what do you think the second part of the
sentence was now what do you think the
context was
now I don't know but I'll tell you the
context I heard
that if you were a slave and you were
working in the field that's like the
worst work
and you'd learn let's say to how to shoe
a horse
like you watched somebody and you you
learned a skill to shoe a horse you
could improve your situation from the
worst thing in the world to slightly
less worse
still slave still terrible everybody
agrees it's the worst thing in the world
but at least you got out of the field
by learning a skill
and then
presumably when you know slavery ended
maybe some of those skills could could
be used productively now does anybody
think
that whoever was saying the sentence
could be applied for their personal
benefit
is there anybody who thought that that
meant
well you know they had a pretty pretty
good I'll tell you you think you've got
a good well let me tell you how happy
those slaves were no nobody's saying
that and you know nobody's saying that
right so there's your fake news
partial quote about a public figure from
somebody who paid to make trouble
there isn't the slightest chance
that any of this is true not the
slightest all right now for your uh just
to round out this point
there are a lot of sources of
information but they do not have all the
same credibility and while I think my
audience understands it you know which
things are more credible than others the
the general public needs a lesson
now I'm going to show you roughly what
that lesson should be
okay so I'm going to kind of do it on
the Fly here
but there are lots of ways that we learn
things and they're not all equal
let's say you see there's a scientific
event or let's say activity in which
they produced a pre-print paper preprint
so somebody says yep we did this study
it's a preprint what level of
credibility would you give a pre-print
study and that means there has not been
peer-reviewed
close close to zero would be the right
answer right close to zero but how many
people would know that
Who would know that do you think the
general public when they hear there's a
study and it's written up in a preprint
do they know that that has no
credibility
probably not right they probably think
it's over 50 percent don't you think or
maybe they probably think it's about 75
likely because you know scientists
scientists
now suppose that same thing got
peer-reviewed
what's the credibility of one anyone
peer-reviewed scientific journal give me
give me your number your estimate of
just generally
credibility
it's less than 50 percent
your common sense would put it way above
50 percent but it's been studied right
it's been studied by a lot of people you
can't reproduce
half of the things that you know pass as
peer-reviewed do you know why
do you know I peer-reviewed has such a
bad record
because peer review is
it's just complete
the the person who does the peer review
is just basically looking to see if it
looks like science
that's about it they're not checking the
data they're not going and recollecting
the original data all they're doing is
saying okay you had some data you say
it's true I'm not checking
and then you did this manipulation with
it and you look at it and go all right
it looks like somebody who knows what
statistics are did it so you got data
they say is true statistics that I
haven't looked at in great detail but on
the surface it looks at least they did
the math right and then they say it's
peer-reviewed
that gives you almost no Comfort
whatsoever
so peer review is a completely nakedly
broken system has been forever it's
widely reported at this point but if
you're not a nerd who pays attention to
the news how would you know that
how many people that you stop on the
street
and you said peer-reviewed scientific
journal How likely is it right
the only thing most people would say 90
percent
75
it's actually closer to 40 or below
right how about anonymous source
let's say it's in a really fine
publication like the New York Times or
the Washington Post
The Washington Post let's say they have
a story with a anonymous source what and
let's say it's about politics
specifically it's about politics and
it's negative for one political figure
zero yeah the the correct estimate is
zero I don't think I've ever seen one
that was true
can you remember one that was ever true
ever I don't remember any
so if you're not a certain age
you haven't seen that many times that
this comes and goes but I have I've seen
enough I don't think any of them were
true so on the surface if you see a
Washington Post story from an anonymous
source you should just laugh
that's the right approach just laugh
they're not even trying how about a
video
let's say there's a news story and they
just show you the video so you can see
for yourself you can hear for yourself
well what percentage would you put on
The credibility of a video
um thirty percent
maybe 30 percent
uh somebody said 30 I'd agree with that
that that's where my personal estimate
is around 30 even if you're looking at
it even if you're hearing it and even if
it's completely accurate about 30
because what they leave out
is what happened just before the edit
and what they leave out is what happened
just after
that's how you got to find people hoax
and the drinking bleach Oaks those were
videos and the Covington kids hoax right
and also the uh Trump overfeeding the
koi fish
all of them are the same the same
technique the video is real it's exactly
what what is there is exactly what
happened it's just the beginning and
then we're taken out to change the
context
all right
how about a full quote as opposed to a
partial quote so it's a real thing
somebody said
that part is established let's say with
documents or whatever and so he says
somebody said it's not a partial quote
what credibility do you give a full
quote
no more than 20 percent
credibility no more than that
because a full quote still has the
problem of being taken out of its larger
context do you know why something is
news
this is the Scott Alexander observation
which changed my life
that this little this little piece of
knowledge I've said it before but it
fits in this context
the reason something becomes news is
because it's not true
do you understand why
the reason it's in the news is because
it's not true
because things that are true don't
surprise you they're not newsworthy
they're not
so the only thing the news does is
something that will make you go what are
you kidding and reality doesn't do that
too much or not enough to sustain the
business model so if you see something
that let's say you read tomorrow that
Hunter Biden was found on the side of
the road
cannibalizing a stray dog he was just
eating it with his bare teeth and that
was his story
what would be your impression of the
likelihood of that being true
you should immediately say no the reason
it's a story is because it's so wildly
implausible that your brain explodes
when you hear it
so the more the more like Hunter
cannibalizing a stray dog with his bare
teeth the more of the stories like that
the less likely is true right is the the
reason that's in the news is because
it's untrue
so once once you get rid of the model
that if it's true
and important that's like a direct you
know path to the news
not if it's boring
if it's true and important it does not
become news not automatically because
nobody cares let me think of something
that's true and not in the news
um pollution doesn't seem to be getting
worse in America have you have you seen
all the big stories about the pollution
at least overall you know In Pockets yes
but overall
no it's not a story this is just sort of
a good thing that's about what you think
it is and that's about it it's a big
deal I mean the actual environment that
you have to live and breathe and drink
it's a big freaking deal
but it's not news
because it's just what you expected
but the day you get Hunter Biden eating
a strayed dog with his bare teeth on the
side of the road last news it just
didn't happen
all right
how about a whistleblower under oath one
whistleblower under oath with no
documents to back it up one
whistleblower under oath with no no
backup
no supporting documents and no no
friends who saw the same thing
credibility
50 percent
yeah yeah if you say less than 50 I
won't argue with you so I'm saying yes
missio 20 to 50 that's that's about
right
if there's no supporting evidence just
one person
not good enough
suppose you have two
suppose you have multiple whistleblowers
and they're both under oath and they
should have the same story
where are you now
yeah you're up around 75 90 aren't you
and then the whistleblowers produce the
documents
emails and the documents
agree with both whistleblowers under
oath
you're up you're up close to 100 I'm
going to say nothing's 100 but you're up
to 95.
yeah it might even be 99 right
exactly
all right so here is what I would love
to see
as a standard for the news imagine you
had an AI news bot and you told the AI
all right look at all the other
headlines and stories and the other
Publications
uh take them and compile them
and then put a grade on them for
credibility
so it would collect all the stories of
the like the Abram you know Candy quotes
and the RFK quotes they would say uh
okay give that a you know give that a 2
out of 10 for credibility
yeah we'll give this one a you know give
this one a one and you know maybe maybe
this is a zero I will give that one
whistleblower uh
you know a five out of ten two
whistleblowers will give us seven or an
eight and two whistleblowers with
documents boom tab
ten doesn't mean 100 but 10.
how much would you love
to see the stories you're seeing with an
overlay of The credibility based on the
quality of the evidence
now another one would be the other one I
use is uh are the left and the right
reporting this story the same
that's a really good one right so if if
the left and the right will say there's
a hurricane
probably a hurricane
a very good chance very good chance if
the left and the right say uh Trump made
a giant mistake and then they you know
showed to you in the video and the
documents and everything probably true
because even you know even his friends
say it happened
but suppose one entity says it happened
and the other entity says it actually
didn't happen
did it happen
and it goes either way so it could be
CNN says yes Fox News said no or doesn't
cover it or or the reverse Fox News says
it happened and CNN just says it didn't
you need both of them to say it before
you can be confident
doesn't mean the one source is wrong
but you shouldn't have confidence
in any anything that's only from one
side the other side says it didn't
happen
because you do see examples where one
side is just purely lying and it did
happen
it did so it's not 100
but the only thing that gets close to
100 is when the enemies agree on the
facts
then you're pretty confident but not
great
all right uh Kamala Harris said in a
tweet the extremists want to replace
history with lies talking about the uh
the slavery and the slaves benefiting
somehow from
from learning skills allegedly and she
said extremists want to replace history
with lies and we will not stand for it
and then in Florida she stands with them
blah blah did anybody tell Kamala
that Satan news didn't start in 2015
when Trump came down the escalator
they're actually people who are you know
modern adults
who like can wear suits and you know
look good and they can get jobs and they
went to college and everything
actually went to college
and somehow
believe that history is real
how many of you think history is real
I mean the big events are but I'm
talking about the interpretations
of why
it's not real
let me tell you something that most of
you won't believe but a few of you will
if they wrote the history of the last
six years that I've been involved in
politics
they wouldn't even be close
because the things that are really
driving things are completely unknown to
the news I don't know how any historian
would find out like I see things
regularly
that that describe why things are
happening that you know I can I can
determine her High credibility kinds of
stuff and it's nothing like what's in
the news the news is completely
disconnected from why anything happens
they're a little bit good on what
yeah hurricane did happen
uh the electoral college did vote right
that kind of stuff the Supreme Court
made this rule that's good but the why
of why anything happened
that's not in the news that's always
unknown to the public
and I know more wise than historians
I mean there there are major major
stories that I personally know are not
real and never will be real because the
thing that they don't know they'll never
know
right because if it was involved and how
they did it so I personally know that
the history of my lifetime will be
ridiculous it'll just be stupid it won't
even be close
and you believe that the Ancients had a
better process
I mean it's it's straight to say that
history is written by the winners but
it's even beyond that it's not just the
winners it's the person who wrote it
I mean I guess you have to be a winner
to even get the job of writing history
but it's not even the wedding it's just
that it's individuals it's humans if
some human with
getting paid
yeah maybe somebody wants to write a
history book and all they want is to get
paid so they make some stuff up
so it's not even just winning it's that
people do it humans write history You
couldn't possibly be true
let me design the system for you all
right let's design the system we want a
system that records accurately all the
major events and reasons for them in
history all right good all right that's
what we want to do now let's design a
system to get that done
all right we're going to pick people who
get paid no matter whether it's true or
not we'll call them historians and uh
they will be just as flawed as they are
in every other element of human
activities
and then we'll assign them to get us our
accurate history
who makes that system
design is Destiny right our our history
making and recording process is designed
to make them all lies
you get that right it's not designed to
be accurate it's designed to create lies
that create the narratives that drive
civilization and by the way I don't even
know if that's a problem
so here's where I you know give you the
old switcheroo it might be better to
have fake history
in fact I could make a pretty strong
argument the fake history is way better
than real history
because it means that somebody said you
know we can accomplish this or you know
the world would be better or the country
will be stronger if we just sort of
decide this is our history
because what you do in the past or I'm
sorry what you do the decisions you make
next are almost entirely driven
by not just your capabilities but who
you think you are
how important do you think it is to my
future decisions just everything that I
Define myself as a patriotic American
like in your mind you think well that
doesn't really affect too many things
except you know maybe your Vote or
something but I would argue that it
affects everything I do
my my definition of myself
as a patriotic American
that informs littering
right like I've got a piece of garbage
in my hand and I'm walking down the
sidewalk does an American Patriot
just drop it on the sidewalk
do I litter
no because that's not who I am
I'm an American
right and I take that seriously
and all the history of what an American
is
which is you know pure propaganda right
I've just been programmed the way every
kid who was programmed so I've been
programmed to have this feeling of
America sort of you know special and you
know we we're if we see a problem we
solve it actually that's that's maybe
the single most important part of being
American
you see a problem
and then you just go solve it we're
we're really big on problem solving yeah
as opposed to history right maybe in
Europe it's more about history
but in America it's like that's broken
that's just broken let's fix that right
away fix it so I see the you know the
garbage in my hand and I'm looking for a
solution which is the garbage pail
so that's just part of being an American
if I didn't think I were an American I
think I might drop the garbage on the
ground
I don't care it's not my country
so I don't think you understand how
important history is
to give you a definition of who you are
and then that informs all of your
decisions even even stuff like working
hard and obeying the law
that's American right I mean you could
easily imagine if you didn't have that
programming you'd wake up into the
system and say all right what's easier
stealing or working
huh steel looks good
so the civilization requires on some
kind of agreed upon lie
about who we are and why we're here
I'm not sure you did the truth
all right
um Elon Musk tweeted the scariest answer
to the Fermi Paradox that's the question
of why we haven't seen the aliens if
there are so many of them allegedly the
scariest answer to the Fermi Paradox is
that there are no aliens at all
there that we are the only candle of
Consciousness in an abyss of darkness
to which I say
kind of a downer today
kind of a downer
but uh I added of course if we're a
simulation
which I think we are billion to one odds
we are then being alone would be the
normal State just like a video game
right if you play a video game it's
limited to the you know one planet or a
few planets maybe but it's not the
universe
so the the nature of a video game or any
simulation that we would build is that
it would be limited in its scope and you
wouldn't need other aliens on some
planet we never go to
so
it seems to me it's just more evidence
of being a simulation and
but that doesn't mean you're alone
it means the opposite
it means that there's a Creator
Dimension and maybe those creators had a
Creator Dimension about them so actually
if we're alone it's more indicative of
being infinitely
uh surrounded by Creator Dimensions we
just don't have access to them
so it's like being alone on the other
side of a wall
right there's somebody on the other side
of the wall it's just you can't touch
them and deal with them but we wouldn't
be technically alone and maybe our own
creators are watching
that's what it feels like
my my actually lived experience is that
there's somebody watching
how many of you have that you might say
it's God or somebody else or maybe your
spirit guide but how many of you have a
ongoing feeling that there's some entity
that's watching you I totally have that
and I I don't have religious belief but
I have a strong feeling of being watched
that always have
from from my earliest memories as a
child
I was sure somebody was watching now
you'll call that God and I won't argue
with you
but the simulation Theory gives you a
Creator as well it's just a different
form
all right
also the simulation Theory I like
because it
it explains you know
everything all right enough of that
uh
I had the greatest day today so far
do you know how long I've been arguing
that when somebody debates with an
analogy you know the analogy is the the
logic of their debate and I keep saying
no analogies don't prove anything and
then you would say yes they do they do
prove something in this case it works
it's telling you you know history is
suggestive and patterns and blah blah
the analogy is important and then I'll
say again no it isn't you just imagine
that that's Pure Imagination analogy is
just a different situation it tells you
nothing
so I've lost every one of those
arguments would you agree
can we agree I've lost every one of
those arguments people really like
analogies as an important part of the
debate
would you agree
or maybe you think I did win
but I've got the kill shot today you
ready
um when I was talking about the
simulation
um
let's see somebody tweeted this somebody
named share Adventure one on Twitter was
mocking me and said simulation theory is
religion for nerds
my how things have come full circle
simulation theory is religion for nerds
now here's what I did in the old days in
the old days I would say your analogy is
flawed
because one is based on faith religion
and the other is based on statistics
totally different
and that would totally convince you and
change your mind right no it would have
no impact
debating the details of an analogy will
never win your debate
never
so you want to hear what I did instead
I'm so proud of this
that I swear I'm going to sprain my arm
from patting myself on the back in about
a minute
I'm just so happy
all right so after I saw the tweet that
said simulation theory is religion for
nerds instead of using my usual
anti-analogy thing I said
I tweeted uh analogies give you an llm
level of intelligence in your arguments
get back to me when you achieve AGI
good
ah
you feel it
do you feel that
yeah now granted nine out of 10 people
will not get the joke
nine out of ten won't even know what llm
is or AGI but if you went and looked it
up it would be pretty funny
so if anybody's not familiar with those
terms they're AI terms llm is our
current model of intelligence which is
we know to be nothing but a pattern
generator
that's what analogies are analogies are
just I recognize that pattern
but real intelligence the kind we
imagine to be like human intelligence
but I think we're imagining it is called
AGI it has some other words too
so instead of arguing the analogy I'll
simply note that that's an llm level of
AI
and I don't deal on that level
but if somebody wants to upgrade to AGI
that's actually thinking
and not just based purely on pattern
recognition now that's a debate I'm I'm
all for
so I love the fact that this comeback
requires somebody to do research
it's like homework not only am I going
to disagree with you I'm assigning you
some homework you're going to have to
study up on this to find out what I just
said about you it's like the perfect
tweet and I would like to authorize all
of you to steal that tweet you can even
say it's yours I'll give you a full full
rights to it because analogies Must Die
we must take analogies at a public
debate because it's just too
unproductive
so
come back to me when you're AGI
all right so I uh Greg got fill a quote
on competence I'm just going to read it
because I liked it so much
it's kind of a kind of a chaser for
today
uh so Greg duffel tweets every absurdity
today can be traced to an abdication of
Gatekeepers for competence
New Hampshire pedophile elevated to
public office so these are the examples
absurd diversity hires for the military
to VP
uh you know the VP being a diversity are
we're told our standards for efficacy
are oppressive but the replacement is so
destructive it will take years to fix
now
I feel like this is a vague effect
am I right
now that you have a credible uh
presidential candidate
who is saying that you know the the
the affirmative action hiring
is ruining our capability as a country
because he can say at least not getting
canceled and he's showing his work he
shows his work he makes great arguments
it allows the rest of us to play in this
sandbox
now I think that maybe in a smaller way
I'd I helped as well by getting canceled
we're saying stuff that everybody thinks
so this is Vivek saying things that
everybody thinks that everybody thinks
that if you focus on something that's
not competence
well you'll get exactly what you
designed the system to give you
right design is Destiny so if the design
is we're going to favor your immutable
characteristics not your competence
you get what you pay for
so I just love I guess the I love the
quote I love that he said it and tweeted
it but I love most that Vivek allowed us
to do this just speak our honest
opinions we're not always right
I'm not going to claim that you know
Free Speech makes me right but damn I
want to be I want to be wrong in public
if I want to and I want you to tell me
I'm wrong and then show you work and
maybe I get smarter but absolutely I
want the I want the free speech expanded
and you know once again
Vivek he's changing the world
without being elected
who does that
Trump the only only Trump I can't think
of anybody else but running for election
he's changing the world
now I would say RFK Jr same thing
RFK Jr I'm not even sure he expected it
or thought he could get elected he
actually speaks about getting his Free
Speech back via process of being a
presidential candidate he says that
directly that he would be he would be
too censored saying the things he's
wanted to say forever about you know
health and environment and everything
uh that he has to be a presidential
candidate to have any chance of all of
not being
squelched he's right
but how much do we owe Vivek and RFK Jr
right now a lot
big debt big debt to those two
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen is what I
believe will be the finest entertainment
that you've seen
today
so far
um yes so X so test so I'm sorry Twitter
will become X
and uh
uh what do you think of that
what do you think of Twitter becoming X
my understanding of it
is that it would be the beginning of
turning Twitter into the everything app
right
so that so X actually is a perfect name
for something that's the everything app
it's also got the X Factor
it's easy to remember easy logo it's a
good choice it makes me wonder why it
didn't exist now
um correct me if I'm wrong there's no
current stock that starts with X right
let me check I don't think there is
Xerox or Xerox
oh xerox's acts oh that's a problem I
wonder if he has to buy Xerox
what would it cost to buy Xerox so they
could get that X
uh
SpaceX yeah we got a SpaceX
he likes his exes the Tesla Model was an
X
so he's put an X and everything he's
done he's clearly been shooting for X
for a long time
text X
oh yeah there's an X in text yeah
that is car models were S3 XY sexy
uh
all right Grimes is X oh yeah he's got a
whole bunch of x's
yeah there's lots of x's and Hunter is
X-rated
X is U.S steel no it isn't is it
