foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
today with more colorful t-shirt yeah
that's why you're so happy as soon as
you saw me in my colorful blue t-shirt
you said my God it matches your eyes so
well and makes me happy just to see it
but if you think you're as happy as you
could be not even close not even close
We've Only Just Begun and if you'd like
to take it up to the next level all you
need is a cup of mug or a glass of
Tankard chaucers die the canteen's
younger flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called
the simultaneous sip it happens now go
ah
I believe everybody but Erica
participated Erica
all right
next time a little bit quicker with the
mug that's all I'm saying a little bit
quicker with the mug
Erica
all right um
I was watching uh YouTube yesterday the
Y files one of my favorite new YouTube
shows about all kinds of weird things
and Mysteries and such
and they had this long program about all
the Giants
that have been found around the world
did you know about that apparently
they're just all kinds of uh burial
sites where they've dug up bones and
found that they were giants
you know like hey there are eight feet
tall nine feet tall you're routinely
over seven feet tall
but I learned something about giant
bones this is something I didn't know
all over the world these giant bones
were being dug up and often sent to the
Smithsonian
so you'd ask yourself
um is the Smithsonian full of giant
skeletons and the answer is no
many giant skeletons have been sent to
the Smithsonian and they keep losing
them
[Laughter]
sometimes they sometimes as the news
reports said the bones once once exposed
to air crumbled back into dust oh
we had those giant bones we had them and
right before our eyes
they turned into dust and not just some
giant bones
but there were giant bones all over the
world that as soon as they hit the Air
Boom what's weird is that they wait
until you take a picture
that part I wasn't expecting
so you'll you'll unearth them you'll
carefully remove the dirt with little
brushes until you've got this nice giant
skeleton you'll take a bunch of pictures
and as soon as you're developing the
pictures uh
the bones they dissolve into dust every
time so we we don't actually have any
giant bones but they've been found all
over the world
now I have something to add to the story
I grew up in Upstate New York and I
forget what town it was maybe somebody
remembers it was the town of a famous
giant hoax
and somebody was it a pilt down man
I'm feeling like that's what it was
built down man
um but but somewhere near me with
Champlain maybe Champlain
I think that might have been it I think
somebody got it
um but we were told the story about a
giant that had been discovered and uh
Cardiff maybe Cardiff why does that
sound familiar
I don't know but it's fairly common in
fact it's one of the most common hoaxes
that they found giant mountains my guess
is they've been finding giant bones in
every civilization forever
and they've all got you know giant myths
and stuff however
I would like to just add this little bit
of Hope
I'd like to I'd like to think that there
were giants
I like to think they were so big it
explains how the pyramids got built
they just like picked up one block at a
time like a giant or something like that
you never know
maybe there were giants I sure hope
there were but probably fakes
speaking of fake news
here's the treatment the CNN gives RFK
Jr
so I'm going to read you the headline
and then I'm going to read you what he
said
because they quote what he said
do you think that the headline of what
he said matches what he said in the same
article
will you be the judge here's a headline
by Abby Turner and Andrew Kaczynski and
CNN
it says uh Robert F Kennedy Jr
repeatedly suggested that chemicals in
water are impacting sexuality of
children
he repeatedly suggested so here's a
keyword suggested
that the chemicals in water are so he
suggested they are
and then you read the article for his
own words
it says you know experts dispute the
claim blah blah blah but uh Kennedy told
CNN's gay files his theory is that quote
sexual identification and gender
confusion
among children could be from their
exposure to quote
endocrine disruptors found in the
environment could be
could be
so he basically said there's a
correlation or something that should be
looked into
and that the headline turned it into
repeatedly suggested that chemicals in
water are impacting sexuality of
children
now suggesting that they are
that's kind of similar to could
I mean it is
but when you separate the suggested
from the r in the sentence it's like you
forget the suggested and you get to the
r
it completely reverses it
if you said to me there's a guy who's
who's worried about something in the
water that doesn't belong there and
there's some indication I'm no scientist
but some indication it could have a
correlation with their sexual hormones
should be looked into
is that is that crazy is it crazy to say
that a chemical that we have some
indication would do this exact thing
this exact thing
and it's in the water
shouldn't we look into it
at what point did RFK Jr say he's sure
that it's the problem
you did not
you never said are you sure
he said there's a correlation there's a
reason to look into it now the experts
apparently have said they looked into it
and found nothing but that's a separate
question
so CNN fake news being their usual CNN
fake news selves
nothing new there
um Tim Scott so I'm getting a little
heat online because what he was asked
about uh I think it might have been
Pierce Morgan asked him what he was
going to do for black Americans and his
answer was I look forward to presenting
a solution that works for all of America
so Tim Scott did not take the debate of
what he was going to do special for the
black population of America rather he
was going to do something that works for
all Americans of course I saw him being
criticized by
you know at least one black influencer
who was saying of course he's going to
do nothing for us those Republicans
they're doing nothing for us
well I have exactly the opposite point
of view I think Tim Scott
and the Supreme Court and a number of
other people
have finally
finally
allowed I'll say aloud that's you know
the wrong word but you know what I mean
that black Americans can be treated as
full citizens now
I don't think that was true even a year
ago I feel like Black America got the
biggest promotion
since the end of slavery
in the sense that now they they are
fully competitive
fully fully considered in every way the
equal of everybody else and nobody's and
people just stopped after asking the
question
so the question of what to do special
for Black America is one way to be
condescending and to guarantee that
discrimination continues because if
you're treating one one group of people
like their retards
sorry I shouldn't use the r word uh and
that's what was happening that's exactly
what was happening we're treating one
group of citizens like they couldn't
compete how about we treat them like
they can how about we treat everybody
like they can how about we stop being
 just for a little while
stop being condescending
stop being condescending how about
everybody can do fine just just let them
do their thing they'll be fine I remind
you that whenever black Americans have
had full and free access to markets
they've dominated
they've dominated right Sports you know
when black people couldn't you know
couldn't even participate in sports in
America
well as soon as they could participate
fully dominated music
probably didn't want to you know sign a
black musician at some point in history
because they were black today dominating
dominated the energy fashion dominating
entertainment and dominating
so why don't we just say
let everybody compete
just let everybody compete that's where
we are now so Tim Scott is exactly right
you know he's doing the politician
version of it let's treat everybody the
same but I don't think it means the same
as it it has in the past
I think there's genuinely a promotion
involved here I feel like finally we can
just forget it all as all of the going
forward stories about everything from
reparations to any kind of special
treatment I feel like I'm not going to
cover them the same
because I feel that that's condescending
do you even imagine that we should be
doing that or that you know you need
these special you know special
accommodations for one group
filing full respect full citizenship
full promotion
to me it feels like the greatest thing
that's happened honestly since the end
of slavery
that's you know that's a psychological
effect that's happening inside my head I
don't know if any of you are having the
same feeling let me ask you is there
anybody here who's had the same feeling
at all
as it occurred to you oh my god finally
like this long march toward equality we
finally got there
now it will be bad for some individuals
everybody knows that there will be some
individuals who don't get that you know
extra extra leg up
but in the long run this is where we
needed to get it was always going to be
messy
so it's not perfect
but this is where we had to get
so congratulations to Black Americans
um you might not be happy about it but I
think it's the best just I think it's a
great thing honestly
all right here's some good news
everybody wants some good news today how
about we only do good news today are you
ready for this
it's really actually pretty good the
news is serving up some delicious stuff
today right in no particular order
in no particular order
jobs Market in the United States looks
surprisingly strong
and if jobs are good you're usually okay
uh today the news is saying that
inflation it does look like it's
permanently using and it does look like
some amount of the inflation was
transitory
some of it was so apparently we're we're
getting back to normal on inflation
we're not there but it's heading in the
right direction uh the news is saying
today that a recession is less likely
than we had imagined at any prior time
in fact Biden says probably won't even
have one
how good a news is that
that we might have missed a recession
about Banks recovering I guess there's
more earnings coming out for the smaller
Banks so we're not so sure if the
smaller banks are solid but apparently
the large Banks and I would argue that's
the most important part the large Banks
look to be solid they actually have a
year that
looks pretty solid
so our banking looks like it'll survive
we're there's still a little wait and
see on today for the smaller Banks but
it looks like it's going to survive it
looks like the economy made it through
the pandemic
um almost everything is pretending
positive I believe we're producing more
energy I believe the price of gases down
to where it was pre-pandemic there's a
lot of stuff going right
a lot of stuff going right and do I have
to mention that you're no longer have to
wear a mask on airplanes you don't have
to get your vaccinations to fly
mortgages are crazy
your interest rates are crazy that's not
ideal
but I think the more I think the housing
market was overheated
even though it's bad for people trying
to buy into the housing market I feel
like we needed those higher interest
rates
because didn't you think a bubble was
forming and real well probably did in
real estate it was just going up too
fast
there was no way that was sustainable so
even even the higher interest rates
they're putting a drag on housing
probably was the right thing
so there's a lot going right
here's another piece of news
well I guess it's not all good news
there's an over-the-counter birth
control pill that got approved
so now you don't need your doctor to get
your birth control you just get rid of
the counter
um I don't know if it said you have to
be over 18. I didn't see that did
anybody see that do you know what age
you can buy it
is there an age
limit for the new pill
probably no right
because it's over the counter
well I guess it could have an edge
restriction
yeah anyway I don't know about that but
as we've talked to in other live streams
I am of the belief that the birth
control pill changes the personality of
the person taking
how many of you would agree with that
statement that birth control changes the
personality of the person taking it so
most of you think that's true now I'm no
scientist so I'm not making it a
scientific claim this for me it's an
observational claim just observational
um
all right so
uh my second question is is there
another country I can go to where they
don't have the pillow over the counter
because I'm not sure I want to live in
this one anymore
because
you know
I hate to say it
but
um I was listening to a
Instagram reels yesterday in which some
influencer type was talking about some
studies and I've heard about these
studies but I wonder if they're debunked
so if there's any debunkers here maybe
you've got time to Google it while I'm
talking
has it been debunked the women changed
their preferences for what kind of man
they like
who they're attracted to based on
whether they're on the pill or off the
pill
so I saw that claim
as far as you know is as that studies
did it stand up to peer review and
everything I'm seeing some no's and some
yeses so I'm going to say that's a baby
I'm not sure that's true
you know all science is questionable
these days so that you know the fact
that it was a study would be no more
than 50 percent chance it it's true
but I I tend to lean toward it because
it looks true to me in my life
so I don't for what that's worth
all right
well we'll see if that uh destroys
America or not
uh Elon Musk was uh asked about aliens
again
and oh let me just finish that point the
the belief was that women who are on the
pill
are looking for a guy who's
um like a beta male provider
and when they're off the pill they're
looking for the alpha man we'll just you
know rock their world
is that basically the way it was
supposed to go I don't know if it's true
don't know if it's true but it seems
like it would be
you know I guess logically I can't see
how it wouldn't beat you
are you the same person when your libido
is low
you know if you're a man let's listen to
the man's equivalent
when I feel my libido is low it changes
my entire personality
and when it's high it's just I'm a
different person completely
so why would that be different for women
than if they're if they're sex hormones
in in any way
are adjusted seems like it would it
seems like it would ease out through
your personality I I've noticed that on
days when I have a lot of inflammation
in my body you know just general
inflammation from exercise or whatever
that I'm in less good mood on those days
have you ever had that like your body is
sore and it makes you cranky
right
so it seems like they're just all kinds
of things which could have some smallish
effect on your body
that actually changes your personality
and fundamental way
so we are messing with people's
personalities I think
all right Elon Musk was asked yet again
about the aliens and he said uh quote I
have not seen any evidence of aliens
which is a problem it means that life
and Consciousness might be incredibly
rare maybe we are it at least in this
galaxy now people quickly pointed out
because I tweeted this they quickly
pointed out
um how would Elon Musk know if there's
any aliens
because the the amount of the universe
which has been mapped or that we could
see light from it or we could check it
out directly as you know lesson way less
than one percent right it's
the tiniest fraction of one percent it's
like so much less than one percent I I
don't even know how many zeros there are
before the one it's a lot
right the the massiveness of the
universe can't even be held in your head
you can't even you can't describe it you
can't put a number on it it's just
overwhelmingly large
so to say that we
um
to say we haven't seen any
would you say that's no indication
whatsoever
of whether or not they exist
is that fair
not seeing them has nothing to do with
whether they exist
you know then there's the counter Theory
that they would have had at least some
if there were anybody out there here's
the counter theory if anybody out there
was there was an other life is probably
about one
right
it would be the least likely thing is
that there are only two of us
I would say that's the least likely
possibility is the whole universe had
two just two planets one seems more
likely than two because of how unlikely
it is
but if you could have two I feel like
you could have a lot of them right it
means it's not that uncommon
so if you had a lot of them and you also
had 13 billion years for some of them to
advance and maybe some of them got a
little head start
imagine what human civilization would be
like in just 100 years
just imagine that human civilization is
just 100 years from now
we'll be colonizing space we'll have ai
I've been it's unimaginable how much how
advanced will be
maybe we'll even have a way to go to
those other stars without the
restrictions of you know of physics I
guess so
it would take so little so little for
you know some other planet of uh
creatures to be more advanced than us it
would just be the easiest thing I mean
what are the odds that they're exactly
as advanced basically none
so they're either going to be more
advanced or less advanced
and if there's a bunch of them some of
them are going to be way more advanced
and they could have reached uh the they
could have reached our planet by now or
signaled us or seen us or something
no matter how many there are and how
advanced they are it still doesn't
overcome the vastness of the universe so
there could be gigantic galaxies that
are fully like teeming with life like
the entire galaxy not just the planet I
don't think we'd necessarily see them
so I would agree that we don't know
but I would say there's one situation in
which
um we are almost certainly the only
civilization
and that's it for a simulation
because if we're a simulation we're
built like we would build a video game
when when you buy a video game
is not the domain of the video game
fixed
you can't go beyond what the programmers
created
and and they would never create a video
game that you could play but separately
there's another video game of a whole
other world but you can't get to it or
see it
the programmers wouldn't build that
other world that you couldn't get to and
can't see
and they certainly wouldn't put people
on it that would be a huge waste of time
because the players can't see it
so that's what our real universe is like
there's no way if we are a simulation
and it's probably a trillion to one
answer we are if we're a simulation it
wouldn't really make sense that the
other planets are occupied they could be
there's nothing that would prevent it
but there's also no reason that they
would be occupied because you might
limit the game to like one Galaxy or
something
so
the simulation theory is the perfect
explanation of why you haven't seen any
other aliens
doesn't mean it's true it's not proof
but it is consistent with us being a
simulation and it's very inconsistent
with a universe teeming with life
because life is common
so again no proof but things that lean
you in One Direction
most also predicted that we might be
five to six years away from AI super
intelligence now there's no definition
for what super intelligence means but I
think he was talking about smarter than
people
does that sound right to you five six
years
here's what it sounds like to me
I believe that Elon knows as most of the
people in the field know that these
so-called AGI or the advanced general
intelligence that they're trying to
reach as opposed to the current version
which is just pattern recognition AI
but nobody knows how to make it
so
I would say the predicting one will have
um you know that fully AGI intelligent
AI That's exactly like predicted when
you have Fusion
in order to make it work somebody would
have to invent something that they've
never invented before
and how can you predict that
how do you know that in five or six
years
somebody's going to invent a thing that
never existed and nobody knows how to
make now
I mean that's a pretty big leap
you might be right I'm not saying he's
wrong but and and I and I also agree
with him that if you go out five or six
years
pretty much anything feels possible
so oh it's it's a reasonable estimate so
he's not crazy with his estimate but I
would say this
there is some chances not doable
and I'm still on that page
I don't think you can make intelligence
and here's here's the summary version of
why
the reason you can't make something
smarter in a general intelligence way
than humans
is because our own intelligence is an
illusion
in other words you're trying to make
something in the real world that's
better than an illusion
the illusion didn't never existed
so you can't be something that didn't
exist
by creating something that's even more
unlikely
I don't I don't think I did a good job
of that but intelligence is is
um an illusion
so sit down with your smartest friends
on politics and have a conversation will
you walk away thinking wow I got smart
friends because they agree with me you
know not everything but we we agree on
so much that God those are some smart
friends I really think they're following
the news and paying attention right
now go to the opposite group let's say
it's whatever the opposite of your
politics is have the same conversation
on the same topics you're going to walk
away thinking they're the dumbest people
you've ever met in your life
do you know why because you believe
you're smart
you believe you're smart so you're using
your own your own intelligence as a way
to judge the other intelligences oh the
ones that agree with me
brilliant very brilliant ones who
disagree with me you idiots you fools
that's human intelligence
and worse that's human intelligence at
every level of human intelligence I just
described a PhD
PhD you know most educated human you
could have
a double PhD you put them with their
friends they think their friends are
brilliant put them with the people who
have different political opinions these
guys are idiots read some science
right so how are we going to judge that
uh how do you make something
that doesn't exist they're trying to
imitate something that doesn't exist in
the first place so I think it's
logically impossible
all right but we'll say I'd love to be
wrong yeah if there's anything that you
know I'd like to be wrong about it'd be
that
all right uh there's some more noise
about raps
and I think Tim poo will notice this and
some others did I saw Jack Wasabi
tweeting about it and uh Jack said
Washington Post New York Times Bloomberg
and rolling stone are now not referring
to January 6 as an Insurrection or even
a riot why because they are now
defending Ray Epps
so rayaps is suing Fox News for accusing
him of being an instigator uh he's on
video being an instigator
but you know Fox News I think may have
gone further and said he was a Fed
um now he denies all that of course and
uh now the news is when they're when
they're defending Ray apps against Fox
News they're calling January 6 quote and
I see you can actually see the
screenshots of this those entities are
calling January 6 rallies demonstrations
and protests
that's right when they wanted to uh
when they wanted to impeach trump it was
all insurrectionist coups all just
insurrectionist traitorous coups but the
moment they're defending the guy who was
actually one of the main
protagonists like is that the right word
for this
suddenly oh it's not an Insurrection
it's not a coup it's not it's not a riot
it's a rally and a demonstration it's a
protest it's a protest
now the amazing thing is that they can
do this right in front of the world
and unless you follow Twitter
you probably didn't notice
you know all of us watching this are in
this weird little tiniest of little
bubble which is people who actually pay
attention to the political news
neighbor has no idea this happened right
do you think your neighbor knows that
the entire fake news industry just
changed their framing to fit today's
narrative
they don't know that I mean we know
because they're sharp observers I
wouldn't have even noticed right I do
this for a living basically I wouldn't
have noticed
but I'm glad Tim Poole did I'm glad Jack
posabic noticed because they told me and
at least I you know interact with this
material so I saw it and I can tell you
but your neighbor doesn't know this your
neighbor does not know this this is like
one of the the most important things to
know to understand your world
if you don't understand that the entire
news industry the mainstream news anyway
in lockstep just changed their entire
narrative that was the strongest
narrative for two years two and a half
years it was their strongest unified
narrative and they dropped it like that
the minute it wasn't convenient
meaning they never intended to tell you
news they always intended to tell you
propaganda
because you don't change the prop you
don't change the news
you do change your propaganda
um if you believe is a fad nothing will
convince you he's not I'm not I don't I
don't necessarily think he was a fad
I don't know if I've ever said that have
I ever said that I don't necessarily
think he is
but the way he was treated seems to be
clearly different from the way others
were treated
and there's no explanation for that
what do I tell you when the government
doesn't explain something
they're guilty
they're guilty now that doesn't mean
they are but you should you should have
as an operating assumption that when
your government isn't clear with you
they're hiding something and they're
guilty they're not like people
people are innocent until proven guilty
that's what makes civilization work you
take that away it's a big problem
the governments are the opposite of that
through the flip side if a government
isn't being transparent you should
assume they're guilty that's the the
best working assumption for the health
of the Republic you should assume
they're guilty so the way they're
presenting themselves is as guilty
parties you should accept them in their
word or accept what they're telling you
which is if they're if we're being weird
about it
that's the message the message is not
the words
what the government says in words is
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
that means nothing just ignore the words
just watch what they're doing
We're not gonna we're not going to tell
you about them
okay now we know now we know how to act
we don't know the truth
let me be clear about this we don't know
the truth but we know how to act
and that's all you need you only need
the only thing you need is to know how
to act and then your gut so if the
government is treating us like they
can't tell us you can act like it's true
I don't know what you do about it you
know make sure you vote or do something
like that but do something that's you
know healthy and legal ideally
all right um
in me and I saw this report but it was
only on a tweet without a source
somebody give me a fact check on this
is a fact that the Department of Justice
notified apps that it would seek to
charge him criminally for January 6.
I saw that reported but I didn't see it
in a in a news source I just saw it on a
tweet is that true
because I haven't heard that
he claims it his lawsuit
I don't know
um said he was charged to me oh did he
say that did rayap say he was charged in
May
or is somebody saying he's they think he
was
he claims that in his lawsuit all right
so somebody in the comments okay I'm
seeing several people saying that his
own lawsuit claims that he was
um he was looking at charges in May
okay so maybe there is something
happening there that we don't know about
um and of course all of this the
mainstream media are supporting apps
because apps is going after Fox News who
is the competitor to the other
mainstream media now ask your neighbor
does your neighbor know that the
mainstream media ganged up to try to put
Fox News on a business because Fox News
is the primary
um spoiler to them being able to control
the entire narrative
it's basically the narrative and then
there's Fox News now you also have your
breitbarts and your your other entities
but in terms of total impact
you know Fox News is the one that can
change the narrative right away
so to me it just looks like a
competitive battle that people think has
something to do with news it's not bad
news they're just trying to yeah there's
Newsmax and there's some others but in
terms of size Fox News has got a
commanding leader all right it's a tough
time to be a Russian Commander I saw a
tweet from Paul San
ing he said one top Commander is
disappeared and other was killed in an
airstrike and other accuses leadership
of treachery after being fired and the
fourth former Commander was gunned down
while on a jog it's a hard day for
Russian military
and then the Wall Street Journal says
the kremlin's effort to weed out
officers the suspected of disloyalty is
broader than publicly known duh
is there anyone here who didn't know
that Putin says search for Traders might
be privately larger than has been
reported
is that the big surprise yeah you don't
think Putin was a little bit concerned
about the coup and possible Traders oh
yeah he was so it was a bigger effort
than you think and according according
to some people
at least 13 senior officers were
detained for questioning with some
released and maybe 15 suspended from
Duty or fired
so can you even imagine
the amount of consternation in the
military over there
because
if you had done something you know
traitorous or not
or not
don't you think you'd be worried to
death that he thought you did
because somebody just has to say you
know I think that general you know I
heard him talking
how much evidence would Putin require
before he killed his own General
if you went to Putin and said you know I
probably shouldn't say this but Igor
Igor was talking some about you is
it was very traitorous it was kind of
traitorous the way he was talking well
did he do anything no he didn't do
anything yeah I mean I'm not aware I
wouldn't know for sure I but I heard him
talking man he was talking about
you
you don't think Putin would have that
person arrested fired or killed of
course he would because Putin cannot
take chances
he cannot take chances
if somebody is maybe a traitor
they're probably already dead
so don't you think that the Russian
military
has people within it who are jockeying
for promotions by Whispering about their
boss
oh yeah because they're just like every
other large group of people
you put any large group of people
together and some of those people are
trying to kill the others
every time if the group is large enough
right there's always somebody trying to
kill somebody else in the group it's
humans
so yeah probably probably there are a
bunch of Russians in the military who
are using this as an opportunity to take
out leaders who are mean to them
leaders who are mean to them leaders who
are in their way
for a promotion and leaders who might be
doing things such as you know how
they're waging the war that they don't
like
now how is Putin supposed to tell the
difference between somebody who's just
trying to get rid of a competitor and
somebody who's really dropping a dime on
a on a Trader
you can't
so if you're Putin what do you do
there's only one smart thing to do
is get rid of every single person that
anybody has whispered might be a problem
anything short of that would be bad
dictatoring I mean Kim Jong-un wouldn't
put up with it
and he's lasted a long time
yeah so yeah so you have to get rid of
like everybody who's even got like the
stain of once talked to somebody who was
a who is a traitor
I know how big this effect will be
but I keep telling you that there are a
whole bunch of a whole bunch of
variables in Ukraine and Russia where
there's something that's teetering on
the edge of changing everything
but it just keeps teetering and it
doesn't ever kind of fall off right
because we're teetering on the edge of
somebody's going to run out of enough
weapons
teetering on the edge if somebody's not
going to lift people
teetering on the edge of you know just
everything but one of the Teeters is
that the Russian military could be close
to collapse
in terms of having a you know a let's
say a command line that is obeyed
so
I doubt it if I had if I had to bat I'd
bet against the military collapsing
um but probably they're probably there
are 12 different things over there that
are teetering on the edge of changing
everything
so it's hard to predict
all right uh FBI is uh Christopher Ray
testified to Congress
and if you think that he did everything
he could not to say anything useful or
newsworthy you're right you're right
um can you tell us about X oh that's
still under investigation I can't talk
about that well can you tell us about
why
oh uh well I I don't know that
information but I can I can get back to
you I could totally get back to you well
how about Z
how about Z that's not ringing a bell I
don't even I have no recollection of Z
um well here's a document that tells you
all about the FBI's knowledge of Z oh oh
that's he that's the uh-huh right now I
remember
so apparently he was just as worthless
as you could possibly be which
unfortunately is also smart
unfortunately he played it exactly the
way
you probably should because it didn't
create much problems for him and he
didn't make too much news but a little
bit of news he did make is uh
and Russia occlusion and as Glenn
Greenwald pointed out on Twitter
that Ray basically said that the Russia
collusion the whole
situation the whole Russia occlusion
hoax should not have happened
so it's basically an acknowledgment that
the FBI was behind running a giant hoax
and now the new director says you know
that shouldn't have happened that was
bad behavior
have you seen all the people prosecuted
or fired by did Ray do anything did Ray
bring anybody up on charges
no
no he's admitting the biggest crime in
the United States
is admitting it yeah that happened
and then follows up with there will be
no
you know he didn't say this but we can
observe that there's no legal follow-up
what does that tell you
how in the world do Brennan and Clapper
stay out of jail
now I guess they're smart enough to know
that lying is not illegal
so they just lie in the news and that's
legal enough I guess but how in the
world can there be there's no charges
you can't find anybody involved in that
whole that whole hoax there's not a
single person
the only person who got charged didn't
even leave it lose his legal license
still a lawyer
that was the worst thing that happened
you still got a job
all right
um
and then when Ray was asked
you know if if he'd tell us about
whether there were FBI people on January
6 he refused to answer that what is your
reasonable assumption if they had of the
FBI refuses to tell you what role the
FBI may or may not have had with
undercover provocation of the event you
won't tell you
you have to assume it's exactly what you
think
doesn't mean you're right but you should
act like that's the case
so when you're deciding what to do you
know who to vote for or whatever any
decisions for your decisions you should
assume they're lying and that they were
behind January 6. I'm not saying that's
true
I'm saying that your operating
assumption based on the way the
government has answered the questions
that's that's the reasonable working
assumption does not prove anything
but you should operate on the Assumption
of guilt the Assumption of guilt for the
government because only people only
people get the Assumption of Innocence
not governments government's got to
prove it you're going to have to be
transparent or guilty
actually let me put it that way
with the government there's transparent
and there's guilty
that's it
that's it there are no other categories
transparent or guilty what about the
election
was the election sufficiently
transparent for as a citizen are you
happy with how transparent our elections
are
no no so you should assume that they're
faulty
doesn't mean they got the wrong answer
doesn't mean they're rigged doesn't mean
that
but you should act as though that's true
you should act as though it's true you
don't need to know as soon as you think
you need to know whether it was true or
not you're on the wrong page you've
fallen for the propaganda you don't need
to know if it's true you are you are
absolutely appropriate and within your
logical reasonable rights
to assume it was rigged because of the
lack of transparency
and you should apply that standard to
every part of the government
hey where'd that Ukraine money go
well we can't really tell you or show
you
what do you assume you should assume
somebody stole it
and you should act like that
even if it's not true
you should act like it
all right
um let's talk about the cocaine cover-up
I just like saying that because cocaine
and cover-ups sound like two words that
should go together the cocaine covered
up
all right in the cocaine cover-up
um I guess the Secret Service
is going to meet with the house
oversight committee to explain why they
won't reveal who brought the cocaine
into the White House
uh reportedly there are fewer than 50
people that had the right security
clearance
and if it's only 50 people
and if you had security cameras
everywhere and they haven't told us that
they didn't
you'd assume that they do
what should you assume about this story
given the lack of transparency
get given the lack of transparency
what is the only reasonable thing to
assume
for some reason all the comments Went
Away on YouTube
I can't tell if I think YouTube is still
live
but no comments are showing up
so I'm assume you that you're still
alive if anybody on the locals platform
has another device open could you check
that
because all the comments just
disappeared but it looks like it's a
live feed
all right let me know I'll look up in a
minute oh here we're back we're back
comments are back yay
all right everything's good all right so
assume that whatever's happening with
this cocaine is a cover-up and the worst
case scenario probably somebody somebody
in the administration and they don't
want to add them
probably
um I will add my other hypothesis are
you ready for this hypothesis
in 2023 there's no such thing as
powdered cocaine that doesn't have
fentanyl in it uh people on Twitter said
without much knowledge to back it up oh
but the elites can get the good stuff
no the fentanyl is the good stuff you
don't need better stuff than that the
reason fentanyl is in everything is that
people like it
if you think if you think that in 2023
there's only the problem of people who
don't know there's fence a little drugs
that's a big problem that's a really big
problem but also the addicts are looking
for fentanyl did you know that
uh the addicts are not trying to avoid
it they're looking for it because it's
really good
that gives you good high
so in fact they actually go to they go
looking for a fentanyl they're not
looking
for heroin they're actually looking for
fentanyl now that's the addicts that you
know the serious people
so here's what uh I think they're not
telling you there's almost no chance
that there was no fentanyl in it
everybody agree there's almost no chance
that there was zero fentanylene in 2023
all the powdered stuff has fences
and if there were if if none was in it I
feel like they'd say it
I feel like they would tell you you know
and there was nothing else no fentanyl
for sure
because that would be an important fact
right because of the political nature of
fentanyl that would be a politically
important point on the story
but they don't tell you one way or
another
have you have you seen any major news
entities say what I just told you if
it's powdered and they're calling it
cocaine the odds of it not having
fentanyl or vanishingly small
but yet it wasn't mentioned it wasn't
mentioned
so here's my prediction
that they know ad fentanyl in it and
that's why they don't want to talk about
it
now
I would also add this story is totally
unimportant
this story has no importance to us we
don't believe the Biden Administration
is full of drug addicts you know with
the exception of Kamala Harris who's
obviously inebriated in public every
time you see her
can I say that directly
oh here's something that the mainstream
media won't cancel me for
I'm going to say something totally uh
inappropriate and provocative in public
and now that you know I'm a disgraced
racist according to the media they would
certainly want to report on this
wouldn't they so I'm saying as clearly
as possible is my belief that Kamala
Harris is inebriated
basically every time you see her in
public
now don't you think that's the sort of
thing that you would expect to see in
the mainstream media as
conservative pundit whose disgrace
cartoonist is trying to get up some kind
of story with his stupid conspiracy
theories that Kabula Harris might have
done some drugs or had a drink after
launch
do you think they'll do you think
they'll take me off
I mean it's pretty provocative to say
that the vice president is obviously
inebriated every time you see her
that's a very big claim
do you think the mainstream media
ignores me when I make claims they're
ridiculous
no they don't they don't ignore you
because they use public figures
to
basically as vehicles for their own
message so the story is never about the
public figure the the story is about you
know the content around them that's
that's the story so they would
definitely use me they would use me as a
pawn
to get out their message that you know
people are telling lies about the vice
president
but they didn't
it's kind of kind of the dog not barking
isn't it
yeah do you see the mainstream media say
oh man can you believe it they're saying
the vice president's taking drugs
think about every single thing that
people on the political right or people
have an audience on the political right
think of all the things they say that it
that the left says are not true
well the writer claiming this again but
it's not true they're saying that the
Russia collusion was a hoax but we think
it wasn't right every every important
topic
they tell you that the right is wrong
and why but not this one
not this one
have you seen anybody in the mainstream
media say why do they keep saying the
vice president is drunk when obviously
she's not
kind of missing isn't it kind of
obviously missing
yeah just saying
all right
um
did I warn you that RFK Jr would look to
let's say tweak his climate change
beliefs
to make them more palatable
to the rest of the country
now I don't know if that's happening but
I'm going to read you this story
apparently in some event yesterday I
guess RFK Jr was saying this that
climate change is being used to control
us through fear
what
that came out of his mouth
RFK Jr said
quote climate change is being used to
control us through fear
there you go
[Laughter]
remember I told you that he was going to
modify his messaging on that and he was
going to make it he was going to make it
compatible with the right and you
thought that was impossible didn't you
didn't you think that was impossible
you did not think that could be done you
said he's he's a he's a climate change
guy he's just gonna you know live and
die on climate change the right doesn't
like that so therefore he can never be
acceptable to the right because he's
wrong on climate change
climate change is being used to control
us through fear
one sentence
and he got you back at his side
one sentence
that's all it took now is he saying that
CO2 is not warming the Earth
did he hear that part no no because
that's hard to argue
you know that's a chemical reaction so
it's a little harder to argue that CO2
would have no impact
so instead of arguing that
here's what else he says
so after he says climate change is using
is to control us through fear he says
freedom and free markets are a much
better way to stop pollution
pollution you say
pollution
so when he's talking about climate
change he pivots to pollution and CO2 is
not exactly a pollution
I mean it kind of is but kind of isn't
so who is it who talks about climate
change in terms of pollution and
um control
pollution and control and free markets
who does that sound like
yeah Donald Trump
that's right
RFK Jr actually made his climate change
opinions compatible with Donald J Trump
now they don't believe the same things
as far as I know I'm not saying it's
identical I'm saying that for political
messaging purposes this is freaking
impressive that's really impressive I
did not think
that he would do this well
now he's probably going to talk about it
a lot more he'll get tougher questions
especially from the right so I don't
think he's I don't think he's fixed it
but he has demonstrated he could
he's demonstrated that he he could
actually he could actually bring the
country together of that question
think about that
think about the fact that he's offering
I mean it looks like an offer to me it
looks like an offer to bring the country
together on climate change and and he
just demonstrated he looks like he can
do it
yeah that's that's almost as like
mind-boggling as when we first found out
that uh Trump's team with Jared was
going to make peace in the Middle East
at least you know not not Iran but other
countries
didn't that seem like oh my God that
doesn't even seem possible
and and they did it but RFK Jr is doing
something like that this looked
impossible
but he's he's taken a bite out of it I
don't know if he's going to make it work
but he's got a big bite out of it
all right uh there's the news in the
Wall Street Journal about China
apparently China is not getting the uh
foreign investment it hoped
so the amount of foreign investment this
year was 100 billion last year uh in the
first quarter and now it's 20 billion
so foreign investment has fallen off the
table for China and I wonder what the
reason would be well according to Wall
Street Journal I'll just read what the
Wall Street Journal said
I want you to see when I read what the
Wall Street Journal says about this
situation if any of it rings any bells
or
remind you of anything that anybody's
ever said before or
anything like that yeah just just free
your mind and see if this reminds you of
anybody
so Wall Street Journal says the
perception that doing business in China
has become much riskier is choking the
flow of capital into an economy already
struggling with weak private investment
in consumption
so doing business in China has become
what was it was that much riskier much
riskier
NPC Jester says Scott is backpedaling
I'm back battling
I hope that was a parody was that parody
I think it was parody
you do know that I've been telling you
since 2018 that China was too risky for
business
that was me
I use those words China is too risky for
a business I tweeted it I said it
sounded loud told my friends
here's the Wall Street Journal
China has become much riskier
much riskier and everybody sees it so
they're not investing now
huh
who could have seen that coming
did I predict it
or did I cause it
did I predict it
or did I cause it I told you I was going
to cause it in 2018.
I I
called the I called the wall
I pointed to where I was going to hit
the home run over it
and now you're watching the ball
across the wall
was it a prediction or did I cause it
I don't know
I don't know
I have no idea
but
it was a hell of a prediction
if I didn't cause it it was a hell of a
prediction you're gonna have to give me
that
can you give me at least the prediction
are you willing to give me that
I'll I'll hold off on causation
yeah all right good
but uh
chairman she shouldn't have killed my my
stepson
that was really too far
that was too far
so now you can just
suck it
all right that's it for today that's uh
my show for the day thanks for joining
YouTube I gotta go talk to the awesome
people on locals a little bit more
and
stay awesome
be amazing don't trust your God
