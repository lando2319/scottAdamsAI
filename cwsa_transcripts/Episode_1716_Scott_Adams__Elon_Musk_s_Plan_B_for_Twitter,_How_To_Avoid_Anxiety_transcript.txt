vocals platform by the way sometimes i
go late but they get good stuff and
would you like good stuff too
so here's the situation
i woke up this morning
like i do every morning
whether it's a holiday or a weekend
whether i'm healthy or sick happier or
unhappy
because
i like to be here for you
because i like it
if i didn't like it i probably wouldn't
do it as much right so i like being here
and that is the first benefit you get
this morning
don't you prefer being with people who
want to be there
if you think about it
if there's one requirement you ask of
people to be around you just one thing
just enjoy being there
that's it
it's not really hard
just show just show me you enjoy being
in the room with me and
i am so happy to be around you
that's all it takes now that is a little
tip for the day
you say to yourself
how can i make the world a better place
just show me you're happy to be in the
room that's all
now
how would you like to take that advice
multiply it by a hundred
before we're done here today that's
what's going to happen and it's all
going to start around the time of the
simultaneous sip that will be the
the launch pad
really the beginning of something so
special so amazing that you might even
forget it's easter for a minute
oh then you can return to your religious
beliefs but for a moment
for a moment
you could have a profound spiritual
experience right after the simultaneous
hip
and all you need for that would be a
copper mugger glass of tanker chalice or
stein a canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any kind
except for a cave with a big rock in
front of it which i understand is not so
good for containing its contents if you
know what i mean happy easter
join me now for the simultaneous sep
it's the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit go
ah
yeah
wow
yes
jesus is not the only person
who has risen
i believe that
my spirit has
has risen too
feeling quite good
how about you
anybody feeling better than you did
10 seconds ago a little bit right
you started feeling whatever you were
feeling wherever your baseline was and
then simultaneously happened
probably i don't know
somewhere between 5 and 37
improvement just that that quickly
so you're somewhere in that range
here's something that i've been hearing
a lot
how many times have you heard a
conversation that goes roughly like this
i have a lot of anxiety
okay not yourself you know somebody else
is talking
i have a lot of anxiety
anybody heard that lately
is there anybody in your life
who has told you that they're
having anxiety
well it seems to be some kind of
uh giant
epidemic that's
coming across the country
now
do people with anxiety sleep well
they do not
they do not and the reason that they
don't sleep well is because
why is it that people with anxiety don't
sleep well
what's the anxiety right
the anxiety
causes them not to sleep well now what
would be
something that might cause you
to have anxiety
well i'll tell you one thing that really
can
limit your ability to function well it's
not getting enough sleep
so there are people who complain that
their anxiety is preventing them from
sleeping but also their sleeping is
preventing
them from getting over their anxiety
because they're so not well rested that
they're anxious and then you put those
two things together and they just keep
getting worse and worse until you're
depressed
now
what do people who are anxious and can't
get to sleep do
when they're not getting to sleep
it's 20 22
and it's you know it's
it's 11 00 p.m and you're thinking
wouldn't it be great if i were asleep
about now but you can't sleep so what do
you do
probably take out your phone
start looking at some
viral videos maybe check some text
messages
right
and
so if you figured it all out now the
anxiety
causes lack of sleep the lack of sleep
causes
you to use the smartphone the smartphone
causes you to
become anxious which causes you to lose
sleep which makes your anxiety worse
which there's really only one thing you
can do if you have bad anxiety
you need to distract yourself
with the phone
so one way to cure your anxiety is to
distract yourself by using your
smartphone
which gives you anxiety
and keeps you from sleeping and then
have i made my point
let me i'm going to tell you a story
this sounds unrelated then i'm going to
bash them together i'm going to marry
them right in front of you and they're
going to have a baby idea
seems like a completely unrelated story
here it goes
i've been eating especially
clean lately meaning you know far fewer
additives more natural
and
feeling really good
so the the clean diet is definitely
every day i just feel a little better
just physically i can tell
but one day
my
i guess my cockiness and how well things
were going with my diet caused me to eat
an entire bag of chips
because
i don't know if anybody ever told you
this but
chips
the ones with the little ruffles in them
it doesn't have to be the ruffles brand
but the ridges
they're really good
has anybody told you that i mean they're
really good
and i have pretty good willpower
i i pride myself on being able to you
know have some discipline in a variety
of areas
but nobody's perfect
and with all of my powers
have i mentioned how good potato chips
are with the little ridges
oh my god
they're so good
that
they do the commercial where you can't
have just one right
but that applies to the other brands as
well
you can't really eat one chip
do you know how many times i've
literally tried to do that
i've actually tested it
i'll walk over i'll take out the one
chip and i'll eat it and they'll say oh
it's like exploding with pleasure in my
mouth i'm so happy i'll never need
another chip as long as i well one more
chip
isn't going to kill me
right two chips there's really a
difference between two chips and one
am i right
not really not really if i said somebody
ate two potato chips would you say oh
that's so different than the person who
ate one potato chip no difference
and is there really a difference between
three potato chips and two i don't think
so and what if you get up to a larger
number like 50 potato chips
if you've eaten 50 potato chips in a row
is it the 51st potato chip that's going
to make the difference
no
but it'll be delicious
so there is actually no reason
to stop eating potato chips until there
are none left
that's logic
so i was following that logical path
that day uh from first chip to
bottom of the bag
and this was after eating really cleanly
for a few weeks
guess how i felt
not only immediately when i was done
but the next day
the entire next day
it just completely threw me off my
my healthy path
probably had you know mental impact
probably had energy impact i actually
looked different in the mirror
with my shirt off
right if i took my shirt off i'm like
uh i thought i'd been making some gains
lately but
not really
one day later
after the the chips have had their their
time to work through the system and the
salt i guess
i look the same
you know so it lasted one day but the
the amount of impact
that one deviation had was just so
noticeable but only because my palate
had been cleaned
by a good diet now suppose my diet had
always been sketchy
sometimes it was good sometimes it
wasn't during the day i might have a
healthy thing but
you know he's something less healthy at
night
i never would have noticed
that the potato chips kicked me in the
ass
or
because everything else would be kicking
me in the ass
also so it would just get lost in the
noise so it's quite an experiment
to eat clean for two weeks because most
of you could pull that off right
i mean it's really hard to eat clean
forever
you know i've tried it's really hard
but you can do it for two weeks almost
everybody could and just see what
happens
you will be amazed
how hard it is to have something
unhealthy in your body after two weeks
of not
just immediately you're like oh what the
hell why did i do that
even even things like simple carbs
that you thought were harmless it's like
ah some french fries
if you're if you're eating clean
those french fries will really have an
impact on you and not in a good way
although they'll be delicious they might
be twice as delicious if you haven't had
them in a while my
um all right
so here is my uh big
big putting it all together there so the
people who have anxiety have not figured
out that the things they do
influence the way they feel
and and how consistent that is if you
look in your life the people who can't
figure stuff out
like they've got a problem and they
can't solve it
they have somehow missed
the central lesson in life
that the things you put into your body
have an influence on
how you feel
and as as dumb as it is to even say that
because when i say it every one of you
say well obviously
obviously the fuel you put into your
body makes a difference but people don't
realize how much
i think everybody understands the things
you do to yourself have an impact but
they don't know how much it's the how
much that matters and that's what the
potato chip story was about
if i had not taken out the other
distractions so i could see what just
the potato chips did i would have no
idea
no idea how damaging that was to me i
just thought i would have felt bad all
day for a variety of reasons that i
would never be able to understand
so
when you meet somebody who's successful
here's a little uh
here's here's a little hypnosis for you
i'm going to hypnotize you right now
by telling you something that you're
going to remember
that will then be reinforced in the
future
all right so it only works if you're
willing to let it work
but every time you encounter somebody
who's
successful
in any realm
the question you've got to ask yourself
is does this person believe
that the things they put into their body
have an influence on their performance
and watch what happens
now it won't be 100
you know not every person but you're
going to see something like
80 to 90 percent of the successful
people
are very strongly keenly aware in a way
that informs all of their actions
that the things they're doing to their
body
influence their happiness their anxiety
their health their fitness
their capability their energy
everything
everything
how many of you have at least once since
you've been watching me
and i mentioned it all the time because
i've got a big birthday coming up so
i'll be 65 in a month or so
how many of you have wondered
how i can
get as much done as i get done
and stay let's say at least mentally a
little bit young
do you ever wonder
and
the reason is that i'm really really
careful about what i put in my body
and what i put it through now i don't
get enough sleep
so that's something i'm working on that
has more to do with you know just
current events has nothing to do with um
so i don't have a problem sleeping
i have a problem finding enough time to
sleep
which is a whole separate problem so i'm
completely aware of my need to to sleep
more and probably i'll take a long nap
as soon as we're done here
but uh
the the people who
make it a lifestyle
to understand that everything they're
putting in their body is making a
difference that they can notice it's the
it's the difference you can notice
that's the part that makes the
successful people stand out because they
they just know that you're an instrument
sort of like a race car
you know imagine the best race car
driver in the world but the car is
poorly maintained you could never win
anything
but if you had the best maintained car
probably you don't have to be the best
driver in the world to win the race if
you have the best car or best maintained
so
um
there you go can elon musk
win in his
his goal to buy twitter
well he's mentioned the plan b and we we
know that the board has a poison pill
and maybe the
government will try to stop him and
maybe there'll be various pressures put
on them in various different ways to
make him back off
but
if you know anything about
elon musk's past business adventures
there's not a lot of quitting in him is
there
do you remember the time that elon musk
quit
you know he tried to do something and
then it was hard and so he quit well i
don't
i don't know i i feel like
regular people give up once in a while
but
it feels like
it feels like nothing makes him quit
certainly not being near bankruptcy
certainly not having to work 20 hours a
day
certainly not
you can imagine the pressure that was on
him when he was near bankruptcy after
being rich
but it doesn't seem to stop him
so
can we imagine that elon musk would
simply be dissuaded
because it's difficult
i don't think so
does anybody believe that he'll he'll
stop his whatever he's trying to do
because it was difficult
i don't think so right so you're not
going to scare him away
so let's assume that whatever happens
isn't him saying you know i took a run
at it but i got other things to do
probably not i i feel like he's already
you know got his teeth into it and
it's it's pit bull time like he's not
gonna let go
whatever happens it's not gonna because
he let his jaw loose of the target
so here are some things that i've
learned in the last day because i don't
know really anything about this area
of mergers and acquisitions
so smart people say
that if you sue the board of directors
for rejecting the offer
you're not going to get away with that
and here's why
because the board of directors is only
responsible for picking management
they're not responsible for the decision
and i thought to myself damn it
that sounds like that's probably right
right so if management makes a decision
i suppose you could say the board should
have replaced them or something but
they'd have to have a strong reason and
i don't think we've seen that
and here's here's the real killer
you can't even assume anybody's doing
anything wrong at twitter the board or
the managers or anybody
unless
they have no argument for rejecting the
offer
all they really need is a good argument
and the board of directors is not
responsible for knowing who has the
better one really they're responsible
for picking management
but they're not really responsible for
double checking management's decisions
on everything
you know maybe it's more of a longer
term or is is this manager capable and
you know that sort of thing
so
it seems unlikely
that management of twitter could not
make an argument that twitter would go
up on its own
with or without elon musk to the amount
that he's willing to pay
do you think that they would have any
trouble making that argument
because it's a mark it's an argument
that's made all the time oh yeah we're
just we're putting into place our
advertising strategy
it hasn't been fully rolled out but wait
when that's rolled down look at our
internal documents our internal
documents have been saying for a long
time as soon as our new ad platform
rolls out i don't know if they have a
new ad platform i'm just making up the
part about the ad platform but they're
going to say something
they say oh this management plan we've
rolled out you can see that even on
paper we say we're going to double our
stock price in five years
why would you take a 20
instant gain when you could have you
know double it in five years it's better
so
it should be
fairly easy for management to make the
case that
you're better off just sticking with a
stock the way it is
but
suppose
elon musk decided just just make it
really
uh
hard on the board of directors
could he just make everybody's job hard
enough
by bringing everybody into discovery
bringing them all into the process
because probably he wouldn't have to do
too much explaining and if he did his
lawyers would do it
but you wouldn't want to be running a
company and having to fight off
the biggest lawsuit of the world
from you know somebody who's not used to
losing
so it could be
that he just makes it so unpleasant
to be a board member or a manager at
twitter that they just say you know we
just got to do something besides
fighting in court against the richest
guy around
so let's just give him what he wants
right so maybe he could wear him down
i doubt it
that doesn't seem likely to me i don't
think he can sort of
pressure them
that direct way
but
what if the only thing he asks is for
the board and management
to allow
the stockholders to directly vote on
whether the offer should be accepted
so there's there's a word for that but
we don't need the technicalities
so it's a thing you can do that the the
board and the company
can uh put the vote out to the people
and the people can vote and and if
everybody says that's what it's going to
be then that's what it is whatever the
vote is that's what happens
now let me ask you this
do you think that elon musk could
successfully sue
if they don't put it out for a vote
ah now that's a different standard isn't
it
because it's one thing to say oh we
definitely know that elon musk offer
makes more money than continuing the way
we are nobody really knows that
so the benefit of a doubt i think is
always going to be with management
because it should be probably
but what if he says all i'm asking is
that you let the shareholders decide
what's good for themselves
how in the world
do you argue against that
because it's not that big of a
distraction compared to all the lawsuits
the lawsuits would be a big distraction
but if they just put it out to a vote
that's somewhat routine i assume you
hire somebody who
manages that for you so it's sort of
pretty straightforward twitter could
just you know cue up that process pay
some entity to do it
pretty simple
i think that's much harder
now again remember i don't know the this
field of law or
or economics at all
so i'm just sort of using
you know the best guess and thinking it
through seeing if we can second guess
what's going to come
it seems to me
that elon musk will be successful in
forcing it to the shareholders as a vote
what do you think
do you think he will be successful in
forcing the vote
i think he might be the most influential
person in the world right now
yeah
yeah i think he can
you know remember he doesn't have that
problem of either being on the left or
on the right
he's so ambiguous
because he's he's all in on you know
electric cars and climate change and
solar power
but he doesn't tolerate fools
which makes the right think that he's on
their side
he's just not into nonsense unless it's
funny like the only the only nonsense
that uh elon musk appears to tolerate
is stuff that makes you laugh
and you know how do you hate that which
is part of why you're so influential
because you can't look away
he's got the the trump technique
of being so interesting in a funny way
in an entertaining way that you can't
look away
and the people you pay attention to are
the most influential
they're not you don't pay attention to
them because they're influential
they're influential because you paid
attention to them
it shouldn't be that way but that's how
you're that's how your brain is wired
whatever you think about the most
is the most important to you
by the way i've said that before and
every once in a while somebody's saying
my god that
you just simplified everything
that's it
whatever you pay the most attention to
for whatever reason could be you have
ocd could be somebody who's forcing you
to look at it such as the fake news but
whatever reason you got there
it doesn't matter how you got to paying
attention to it
once you pay attention to it
suddenly it's it's a big important thing
in your brain even if it isn't
even if it isn't
all right
um
so elon musk has talked about a plan b
do you think the plan b
is getting the
shareholders to vote
or is he talking about a plan b if it
doesn't even
get to that because maybe even that
could be blocked
what would be
let's just think logically
elon musk's stated purpose
for wanting to buy twitter is that it's
the the lever to free speech in a
practical sense not not a legal sense
but in a practical sense it's the
strongest lever for free speech and it's
not working right he wants to fix it
so his goal is gigantic because fixing
free speech as he said directly and
often
if you don't have free speech democracy
democracy itself
and capitalism and everything that we
hold to be useful just doesn't work
so he's trying to fix the most important
part
that sort of lubricates everything
do you think he's just going to say oh
i took a run at it
i guess free speech is gone sorry about
that
here's what's interesting
if you were a normal person and you
tried to take over twitter and it didn't
work
you'd probably
just get interested in something else
right you just go somewhere else because
it didn't work
isn't that what normal people do
but if your overarching if your
overarching goal is not to own twitter
i don't think elon musk cares anything
about owning twitter i think he wants to
fix the free speech thing
it looks to me it looks genuine
i mean you could be wrong right you
can't really read minds but on the
surface
and really even under the surface it
looks like he really actually wants to
fix free speech
so if he can't do it by buying twitter
what is plan b
what is plan b
if he can't fix free speech
because of twitter
let me tell you what it's not
starting a competing network
it's not that
no it's destroying twitter
which he could do
he could destroy twitter
do you know what he'd have to do
he'd just just ask all the conservatives
to stop using it
that's it
it'd be gone tomorrow
because the reason twitter works is it
has both sides
twitter works because
it grew up in a day before the the two
sides were so polarized that it was
seemed impossible to be on the same
network
now if you started any network today it
would either be the conservative one or
the the liberal one so all elon musk
would have to do is say
all right twitter
if i can't buy you you need to go away
because you're hurting freedom of speech
and the way you're going to go away is
i'm just going to ask conservatives of
which i'm not i mean you could say i'm
not a conservative
but if you are a conservative why the
hell would you be on that network you
should starve it to death you should
kill it
it would be gone in a week
because it would go down well i mean
it wouldn't be gone so let me
back up on my hyperbole a little bit
because sometimes you take me too
seriously and should because i if i'm
not clear you have every right to do
that
um
he could probably drive the stock price
down 30 percent
by just threatening to do it actually he
doesn't have to do it
you could say plan b is to encourage
anybody on the right to stop using it
he could just say it
and the stock would go down 30
because do you know what the left
believes about the right
that they'll do anything like that
the the left believes the right will do
exactly that kind of thing
and they would also understand that
twitter would lose all of its power if
it's just the left talking to the left
you know is
it's got to have that battle to be a
functioning company
so that's my so my take is this
that uh plan b might be
different ways to buy twitter
but i think the real plan b is if he
can't buy twitter under any of those
ways
that he's going to drive it out of
business
and then they're going to reconsider
selling it to him
maybe at a lower price
because if he takes the stock price down
30
and he's got a perfectly good argument
and reason for doing it
and he's telling you exactly what he's
doing and he's showing his work in
public and it has a public good purpose
behind it which is
you know helping speech
i think he does have the power to drive
them down 30 and just keep his boot on
him as long as he wants
and i don't think the management could
survive
that permanent fight
on the other hand it's election season
coming and nobody wants to get off
twitter and we're all addicted so even
elon musk cannot beat our twitter
addiction
which i think might be closer to the
truth actually but does the left know
that
the left might say to themselves oh my
god he's going to put twitter out of
business
and that's our main lever to power
because twitter
influences the journalists and then the
journalists have to write things that
twitter approves of basically
so
all right
um
next category uh i don't think putin um
is going to win the nobel peace prize
i've been thinking about this for a
while they've had a lot of controversial
winners in the past
but i
i don't know i'm not going to bet on
them i don't think penn is going to win
the nobel peace prize this year
now
i'd love to tell you i'm not 100 sure
i'm not 100 sure
but if i had to bet
i mean i wouldn't bet he's not in the
top five
but
i mean
he is denotifying ukraine
he says
and apparently you can win a nobel peace
prize
uh just for
what you say you're doing in some cases
you don't even have to do anything you
can just say you're doing it and that's
that's good enough sometimes
but i don't think you'll make it into
the top spot but i think maybe top five
top five
um
so the wall street journal editorial
board
is talking about california they're
they're floating in california my wacky
state
to limit the work week to 32 hours in
other words making it illegal to work
more than 32 hours unless you're paid
like overtime time and a half or
something
what do you think of that idea
what do you think of
making it harder for uh everybody to get
anything done
well
i have a mixed opinion
mixed opinion
um and let's call it the uh the bill
gates uh photo session
theory
i once talked to a photographer
professional photographer who was
photographing me for some
article
and
i i always ask the photographers who who
else they photographed because they have
good stories about famous people they
photographed etc
and
um
it's so hard to read your comments and
tell the story at the same time
so
about oh about
how much work you can get done
so if you go from a 40 hour work week to
a 32 hour work week do you think
productivity will change
the bottom line is it depends on the job
bill gates used to say to the
photographer
the photographer would say you know i'm
going to need about an hour
to get the lighting right make sure that
we're getting lots of pictures so we
could pick the right one because this is
going to be for the cover of a magazine
and it's at least an hour so allocate
about an hour to the photo shoot
and bill gates would say you have 10
minutes
and the photographer would say
no whoa whoa i can't do anything in 10
minutes 10 minutes i'm not even gonna my
camera won't even be out of the bag
seriously this is for the cover of a
major magazine we only have one shot at
this this cannot be done in 10 minutes
and then bill gates says
you have nine minutes now no no no no no
it can't be done can't be done
[Laughter]
cameron
can't be done you have to give me a few
more minutes and bill gates will be like
eight minutes
click click click click click click
click i i don't know if i'm getting
anything click click click click click
and we're done and he'll get up and walk
out
now
do you think that
they don't get a good picture that they
use on the cover of the magazine
they do
every time
every time so what does bill gates know
that the photographer doesn't know
that if bill gates makes him do it in 10
minutes he'll do it in 10 minutes
do you know how many times i've seen
that played out
because it's one of the things that
i hate to say but if you're
if you're sort of in the public eye
you often have to limit people's time
because you know they're they're trying
to get a piece of your time
and i do all the time
and it works
pretty much every time
whatever people say they absolutely need
to get a job done
you can say some fraction of that just
like captain kirk
you know it's like the star trek you
know
scotty give me warp six i cannot give
you orb six cabin i can only give you
what four if i give him any more than
what four i will polypot is not made for
warp six captain
and then the captain will say give me
warp six scotty
and then somehow
scotty figures out how to give him warp
sticks
so
when you look at the
on the surface when you say
hey if you limit the work week to 32
hours
it's going to be a lot less
that you accomplish
it's going to be really bad for
capitalism but it kind of depends on the
job i can tell you that there's no job
i've ever had
that i couldn't that i could not have
reduced from 40 to 32 hours
pretty much anything i've ever done if i
had to
right it's only a problem if i add
writing a book or something and then
then there's not much i can do
um but yeah
any kind of uh thinking
cubicle job you could probably do it in
32 hours but as somebody said uh does
somebody think that uh a tesla
factory worker can produce the same
number of cars
in 32 hours as 40
well
probably not
so if it's a assembly line situation
yeah you just
pay more for less productivity so that's
not good
so it depends highly on the job i don't
see how it could ever be practical to
have a
four-day work week
it seems like that should always be
optional
let me give you another story when i
worked as a
salad chopper
yeah that was a job
i think i was in college and i was
working at a big resort in the back
kitchen
and we would have to prepare you know
tons of salad because everybody came in
at the same time in the resort and so we
would just be an assembly line of
chopping lettuce and chopping vegetables
and stuff
and i think there were
maybe five of us
and one day uh one of them quit
and so the boss came in they said she
said
uh here's the deal
i could hire somebody else and then
we'll be back to full staff five people
and then you would be doing same amount
of work you're doing now and it would
cost me the same amount of money but it
would be some extra work
to hire somebody
however
if you'd like
you can do the extra work among
yourselves
any way you want work longer hours work
harder just figure it out and i will
take that extra employees pay and i will
distribute it equally among the rest of
you
have you ever heard of that
talk about something that you remember
forever
like you'll remember that forever now
she was she was the owner of the company
right so she and her husband owned the
resort so she could do what she wanted
so she liked running and that was the
operation that she ran she ran the back
kitchen
and uh
oh somebody says it happened happened to
their dad yeah
interesting yeah and i gotta tell you
the
those of us who remained we were good
employees you know we were the ones who
showed up and did the work and it wasn't
hard
i gotta say i never even noticed
the difference between four people and
five people doing the work i never
noticed
it i i guess you know mentally i thought
i better work harder or something but
i don't think i worked an extra hour and
i don't think i sweat an extra you know
drop of sweat so yeah you can you can
absorb things pretty quickly it's
surprising
here's the dumbest story of the day
dumbest story of the day here's the
dumbest story of the day
uh florida has this rule about a law
that says you can't put critical race
theory stuff in school textbooks
and so a number of textbooks have just
been rejected
by florida
because they did have
critical race theory mentioned
mentions in them and here's the weird
part they were math books
so there were a bunch of math books
submitted
for approval that were rejected
because somebody in florida said there's
too much critical race theory
mentioning in the math book
now why is this the dumbest story in the
day
well
as axios writes so axios reports on this
and they say worth noting the education
department described the review process
as quote transparent but did not name
the rejected textbooks nor provide
examples of passages that failed to meet
the criteria
what
what the hell kind of story is this
i'm keeping it pg because it's easter
what what kind of a news story tells you
that there's a controversy over critical
race theory in math books and doesn't
give you an example was it the first
thing you wondered was
what would be an example of a racist
math book two plus two equals three
because you're
poor
ah
how does that even
look
now
i have to give credit to axios because i
did read this story in other
publications that she'll remain nameless
and they didn't call out the fact
because i was looking for it and
couldn't find it
but only axios calls out the fact that
the entire heart of the story which is
can you give me an example of this
a supposedly racism-related math book
you really really need an example for
this story
this story doesn't really
doesn't work without the examples does
it now maybe they're good examples
i wouldn't be surprised you know there
could easily be
word problems that inject some social
opinion in there could be
but i kind of want to see the examples i
can't judge this story am i supposed to
be angry about this
or am i supposed to be you know angry
that the
that they were blocked
how in the world am i supposed to have
any opinion on this
this is ridiculous
we're seeing examples over on youtube
uh jimmy has five racist classmates one
gets expelled how many races are left
that the only thing i can think of is
exactly that because what is in the math
book except
word problems right
it's got to be it's got to be something
like uh there were four
four white people and three people of
color at the class
uh
three people randomly are expelled how
many races were expelled
what else is it
come on i mean seriously is there is
there a forward or introduction to the
book
that that gets into critical race theory
maybe
maybe because every every possibility
you can think of is sort of ridiculous
so you can't rule anything out if all
the possibilities have to be ridiculous
there's nothing left
so
oh well so that's the dumbest story of
the day the day of the day
all right here's my last little advice
because it's easter and because i want
you all to be happier and more
successful
this will be a weird little reframing
that will
change some of your lives
now again when i do this some of you are
just spectators and you watch other
people's lives get changed
and some of you will actually be the
ones whose lives are changed you might
not know who you are until
you hear the topic
and here's the topic
things that are learnable
but you might not know it
are the things that you see other people
do and you say oh god i wish i could do
that how does that person do that
and you think to yourself they must be
born just born with that ability
if you believe that you're really
missing out
on your best opportunities let me give
you some examples do you think that some
people are good at small talk
and some people are not and it's just
it's just sort of the way you're born
a lot of people think that they think
that small talk is something some people
could do and some people can't and it's
just sort of baked
in but
it's not
it's 100 learnable
the dale carnegie course among others
can teach you how to do it
i teach you how to do it and my book had
failed almost everything and still win
big i steal it from dale carnegie i give
them credit
but
it's just a simple technique now i'm not
going to teach it to you here but it's
basically just showing interest in
people and asking questions that's the
essence of it and it's so simple
not only not only is small talk
learnable
it might be the most easily learnable
thing you've ever met
there's no layers
it's just showing interest in people and
asking questions that make sense it
takes you about five minutes to master
the skill of asking questions that make
sense and then you're done and then
everybody thinks you're awesome and
you're good at talking and they love
spending time with you they don't
realize that they didn't ask anything
about you
they just remember
that it was fun talking to you why was
it fun
because you got to talk about what you
wanted to talk about
you got to talk about yourself and they
acted interested if you act interested
in what somebody's talking about and
it's about themselves they think you're
their best friend
so how about making friends
is making friends
something that's i just some people can
do it like i don't know how it's like
magic
they just got the charisma
no
no it's learnable
it's 100 learnable
and
easy
easy to learn it's not so easy to
implement but it's all doable right you
have to put a little effort into it but
to learn how to do it
let me give you an example
did you know for example science backs
this up if you want somebody to treat
you as a friend if you share a secret
with them
they automatically start defining you as
a friend
because you did you did what only
friends do
now the trick is don't share a secret
that's going to get you in trouble
share share like a little one with the
assumption that it's not going to be
kept a secret because nothing ever is
yeah we're we're in a post-secret world
you just can't assume anything's a
secret
but
if you give them something that's
relatively harmless
you can turn somebody into a friend now
that's not the only technique
but it's not much harder than that
you do the dale carnegie thing of asking
questions and showing interest
you share a secret
and then the only other thing is you
share an activity
that's about it that's it
have you noticed that most of the people
you're friends with is because you bet
in some kind of association or group or
activity
that's all it is you put people in in
groups
and they
to eat toward each other you know people
who just have natural interest in each
other and then you put a little bit of
technique
learn how to make small talk learn how
to invite them over and host oh learning
how to host
now there's something that's completely
learnable
i when i became an adult
i wanted to learn how to host people
which unfortunately meant at the time
learning how to serve alcohol in various
ways so i learned how to serve a whole
bunch of different alcohols and various
ways
i later i learned not to drink alcohol
but before i learned not to drink
alcohol
it was very handy to know how to do a
social event
so very
very learnable how about avoiding
embarrassment i've done some micro
lessons on that on the locals platform
again it's something dale carnegie
literally teaches you how to avoid
embarrassment not how to avoid the thing
that triggers it because that happens
naturally you can't avoid that but how
do i care about it you're just like oh
that was fun
i am literally at the point where when i
embarrass myself like in a really bad
way
i think it's awesome
i just laugh at it i was like oh my god
that's really embarrassing
that is awesome
and
you can actually get there and some of
it is practice some of his technique
some of it is how you reframe things but
it's all learnable and you wouldn't
think so
how about love life and dating
do you think you could just learn
how to be better at dating
yeah
yeah totally
absolutely do you think you could learn
how to get somebody to say yes to a date
yes
yes completely learnable
you know if you think it's not
look into it how about uh
fitness
do you think do you think people are
just naturally fit and some people
aren't
well some people who are not fit
would like to believe maybe that some
people are naturally more fit and of
course there's a wide difference in
you know people's physicality for all
kinds of reasons
but
there's not really anybody who can't get
fit unless they have a serious medical
problem
right that's completely learnable
and i would argue
and and certainly this has been
reinforced recently
i would argue that the thing you need to
learn
to be good at fitness is learning how to
learn about fitness
just learning how to learn if you just
keep your your filter open
and you experiment an a b test and say
well i got bored with this exercise i'll
try this i'll hang around with people
who know how to do this i'll ask them
some questions it also makes good small
talk by the way one of the very best
things for small talk is asking people
about their fitness or
you know or sporting
activities they love to talk about it
and you often find the commonality there
so
fitness is one of those things that you
should treat as an information problem
that's what i teach you and how to fail
at almost everything and still went big
my gigantically influential book
if you treat it as an information
problem you will succeed guaranteed
if you treat it as a
willpower problem it's like i've got to
push myself to hurt myself you'll almost
certainly not succeed
because you know people don't like to
hurt themselves so if you keep hurting
yourself you'll find a reason not to do
it
i got too busy to exercise
but if you use it as an information
problem
you will learn how to for example
use putting on your footwear to motivate
you to actually work out when you didn't
feel like working out it's a little
trick that it's in my my how to fail
book and they're just a bunch of other
little tricks
that once you learn them
it actually becomes easy to exercise so
it's an information problem very
learnable if it were a will power
problem i don't think he could learn it
can you learn to have more willpower i'm
not even sure willpower is a real thing
but you can learn information so reframe
it as information you'll succeed same
with diet diet is completely an
information problem which we
accidentally feel like
is a willpower problem
or how much you like ice cream cream
problem it's not
it's a it's an information problem it's
a learning problem so you can learn
how to eat things that are delightful
and you will enjoy
and that are good for you
you just have to learn it it's not
willpower
um
how about uh being more likable would
anybody like that
how would you like to be not the person
that people go uh
i think i'd like to fill my drink uh
nice talking to you or would you like to
be the person that everybody's
interested in totally learnable
learn how to learn how to tell some
interesting stories
learn how to show interest in other
people
learn that people care about
people more than objects or concepts
if you're doing small talk
don't talk about the concept of the
constitution versus
marxism
you know that the at most that's a tweet
that's not a conversation
not if you want somebody to like you
i mean you do find nerds who love
talking about nerdy things but you know
that when you see it and that's fine
if you both love it yeah go nuts but
watch people's eyes if their eyes are
starting to close
talk about people
the best person to talk about is
the person you're talking about
you talk about that person you're
talking to talk about their family their
relationship their boss
people
that's all people want to hear about
they want to know what people do people
are weird
people
suppose you had a dream last night and
you thought it was really interesting
who wants to hear about your dream
nobody
but the exception would be a quick
summary
i do think it's interesting when people
say
i dreamt i i stabbed you last night
i want to hear about that you know the
details not so much
or if somebody says they had a sex dream
about you well yeah you want to hear
about that don't you of course you do
but you don't need the details of yeah i
was somehow i was in an elevator but
really when it opened
there was my classmates from seventh
grade and
they were standing on a prairie
and then the prairie turned into a
department store like no
no
no this is a learnable skill
here's here's what to learn don't tell
people about your dream
here's another one
oh last night
i had the best meal
this potato
was it was just seasoned just right and
it was just delicious i i don't think
i've ever had a better potato
no
no
no
do not talk about
something you tasted no
because the other person can't taste it
and they've tasted their own food
sometimes they liked it never tell
people about your food
it's bad enough that you post it on
social media but at least as a visual
appeal yeah i can see why people post
food on social media i get it
but if you're telling a story
you don't even have the picture
[Laughter]
imagine how much you don't like it when
you see a food picture on social media
and then imagine it was only described
it was just text
how hard is it to learn what's boring
how about asking you about your job
hey uh bob
uh how's work
uh well
i gotta tell you
can you believe that the rgb system went
down exactly exactly when we need to
submit the pdq
and then the pdq
it's the old technology
and i tried to talk to larry and larry
is saying no it's the new technology i'm
saying to larry what do you call new
this is like five years old and this
time
no
no
no
if somebody asks you how your job is
this is the correct answer
it's great
hey what are you what are you doing
later
do not talk about your job
in fact
just to make the point i i knew somebody
who remained nameless a a top executive
who
was in charge of the syndication for you
know peanuts and dilbert and lots of
interesting things
and when he would be on a flight
if somebody would try to engage him in
conversation and say so what do what do
you do for a living
he would say he worked in insurance
because otherwise he had to talk about
these interesting people he knew for six
hours and he wanted wanted to read his
book
so
talking about your job is just deadly
but know it it's something you can learn
there's no skill whatsoever i'm sorry
there's no natural ability
that matters in any of this
this is all learnable and so what i'm
trying to tell you is there's a whole
bunch of stuff you think you can't learn
other people have some natural advantage
they don't
sometimes they get to it by you know
luck or imitating their parents or
something so they get to it in a weird
way but you can get there too just learn
it
here's my inspirational tale that i've
always thought about all my life and i
don't even remember who told me this but
somebody long ago told me a story about
somebody who was probably my age at the
time
and the person was described as very not
attractive
all right so definitely nothing to look
at
but
was hugely successful with women
and that was the essence of the story
that somebody who really had nothing
going for them physically which is
hugely successful do you know how
this person was successful
somebody said great personality
maybe
but how did that great personality
arrive
do you think that person was born with
it
here's what i think
and this is the part i didn't tell you
in the story
this person
was really good at dancing
so he could go somewhere where there
were women
he could grab a one
and go out and dance and he could leave
and he could spin her around
and
do you think that he was born with the
ability to do that
nope
nope
he was simply
he simply learned how to dance a very
critical skill if he wanted to
compensate for the fact he didn't have
much going on
physically
so did it work absolutely so could he
learn to be popular in dating yup
yup
he just learned a specific skill and it
just took him right to the top of the
heap
now
he also had another skill
he would
let women know
how much he liked them
now you say to yourself well that
doesn't seem hard
it is
it's hard to do it non-creepy and in a
way that the woman actually appreciates
there is a skill to complementing which
was another micro lesson that i did to
how to complement it without sounding
creepy it's a skill
so if you can dance
and you can compliment a woman so she
really feels like that was like the best
compliment she got today and it rings as
true
that's that's the important part that's
the ring is true
but if you can pull that off
you can make a woman feel amazing
and they'll remember how they feel
before they'll remember how you looked
they'll remember how they feel
so that was largely his trick now of
course he probably had some other you
know micro
tricks within that maybe he knew how to
persuade maybe he learned sales
maybe he
yeah maybe i don't think he was nagging
somebody's mentioning that i don't think
he was doing that but
now this this person might not even
exist and if i knew with them maybe i
wouldn't be as impressed as the person
who told me the story maybe it is
morphed in my mind over time but one of
the things i tell you is you should
always have a story
that is like your operating system
so that when something comes up you can
go to your story
so if something comes up like hey
you know you want to be more popular
with other people well
my story is i can learn that
that's my story because my story is this
this guy that i don't know who it is and
maybe he doesn't even exist but that's
my story oh
you can overcome incredibly things you
wouldn't think you could overcome
by just learning
skills and they're not even hard skills
so
remember these tips for today
everything you do to your body makes a
big difference
if you want to succeed do good things to
your body and learn how and if you want
to really really take it up a level in
life in terms of your enjoyment and your
effectiveness just understand that all
of those skills are learnable
and
and as soon as you think somebody has
natural ability well they might
but you can learn to do the same thing
with a minimal amount of learning it's
not even hard
so
because
yeah because this is easter and the news
is almost non-existent because it's
easter
i thought i would leave you with some
something that feels good
so that today you can go forth
and uh make other people feel happy as
well
uh
there's some funny memes going by on the
locals platform
all right
um
youtube
have a wonderful day
um and if you don't if you don't know
how
well you can learn
see you tomorrow
