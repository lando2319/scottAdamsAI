hello everybody
what a great day this is unbelievable
i'm coming to you unshaved unshowered
and dressed poorly it's just the way you
like me
yeah you do it's uh it's true the more
comfortable you are the happier you are
and suppose just hypothetically
you wanted to enjoy this experience
which is
the doorway to the golden age which i'll
be
developing as a thesis in a moment but
to get ready
to be absolutely ready all you need is
a couple of mugger glasses tanker
jealous just line the canteen jugger
flashing a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dolma bean
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's the beginning of the golden age and
it happens now it's called the
simultaneous sip ready
go
oh yeah
so here is the thesis i'm about to
develop
that we have entered the golden age or
a golden age maybe we don't have just
one
but that the amazingness of our time
is completely concealed by
what what you know
fake news that's right fake news if we
did not have
a fake news industry assigning people
opinions
we'd be in really good shape right now
and i'm gonna walk through the headlines
and i'm gonna give you a sense of how
misleading things are right now
things are way better than ever i think
i i would bet that this moment is the
best moment in human history
i think so let's look at the headlines
and find out what kind of
horrible problems the news is reporting
that was weird um
one of the big headlines that's trending
is that apparently
elon musk used somebody's meme
without permission yeah that's one of
the big stories today
just just try to hold that in your head
one of the biggest stories
trending on twitter right now is that
elon musk
used somebody's meme without giving them
credit
that's real that's one of our big
problems today
all right other news three different
agencies put together they're launching
some
astronauts into the international space
station
other news a device just created
oxygen on mars a little bit
but it's a start we just flew we
we the civilization let's say
just put a helicopter on mars
that just happened all right so there's
some of the good news now you're worried
about biden's climate plan
destroying the economy and taking away
your hamburgers
and you're worried about his tax plan
robbing your
robbing your wallet but i don't know if
either of those things are going to
happen and if some version of them
does happen people are really good at
adjusting you know i remember when taxes
were higher under
uh was it clinton the economy was great
right now i don't like higher taxes i'm
not a fan
but it is true that we're not terribly
good at predicting what happens
when taxes go up and down we're just not
good at it
warren buffett famously said that he's
never made an
investment decision because of the tax
rates
think about that the most successful
investor buys and sells
companies uh he's never made a decision
based on the tax
rate it's either a good deal or it's not
and even the taxes doesn't seem to
change things because he's looking for
really good deals so that
you know taxes won't make the difference
so you might not see a gigantic
difference
right now the stock market's looking
pretty strong
looking pretty good actually
warren buffett does sell somebody says
he doesn't sell
he holds for the long term but he does
sell companies that's a real
thing he does fairly frequently actually
he reduces his stake and stuff
so i'm going to count on the republicans
in congress to do what they need to do
to stop or modify biden's
climate and tax plans and if something
happens in that realm we're not going to
die
we're not we're just not going to die if
any of those things happen we'll adjust
we always do here's a little news from
alternate juror on the floyd case
i didn't realize this but apparently the
alternate jurors
don't know their alternates until you
get right
i guess really close to deliberation did
you know that i don't know why i didn't
know that
but it makes sense because if if you
think you're an
alternate the whole time then you feel
like you're wasting your time
then maybe you don't pay attention so
much so
it's actually kind of smart that they
don't tell you who are the alternates
until
they're ready to deliberate so one of
the alternates who was released before
deliberation
said the following and it needs to be
read in its exact quote
so you can understand it and this woman
said i had mixed feelings
oh the question was did you want to be a
juror
and this released alternate said i had
mixed feelings
there was a question on the
questionnaire about it and i put i did
not know the reason at the time was that
i did not know what the outcome was
going to be
so i felt like either way you're going
to disappoint
one group or the other i did not want to
go through rioting and destruction again
and i was concerned about people coming
to my house
if they were not happy with the verdict
uh sounds like we don't really have a
verdict here
does it in the sense that is there any
chance this won't be
reversed on appeal i think dershowitz
says
this is sort of a fairly obvious one
that will be reversed
i don't know if you can predict those
things that well
but to me it looks obvious and i'm not a
lawyer
so what's that mean it means nothing if
it's obvious to me
but do you believe this is the one
the one juror and how lucky we are that
she was released and she was only on the
alternate
do you believe for a second that the
rest of the jurors were completely free
of this thinking
because if they were thinking what would
happen to them
based on the decision that is not a fair
trial
but here's the weirdest thing about this
whole
george floyd thing uh as most of you
have noted
it should have been the most and i think
it will be actually in the long run
uh should have been the most healing and
unifying thing that ever happened in
this country
tragedy of course we had no no
disrespect
to the floyd family but it's because
it's tragedy
but sometimes tragedies can have a
perverse
you know good impact if it causes you to
fix something
later and i think this was a perfect
example this was
this is one example where white people
and black people looked at the video
largely had the same opinion largely you
know there's always somebody
25 of the public will disagree with
everything
but largely white people black people
people of color of all sorts looked at
the video and said
that ain't right whatever that is
that's not right
but because the fake news uh forces us
to
take sides it looked like it was more
disagreement than it really was
but rasmussen has some polling numbers
about how people feel about the verdict
and here you go democrats if you add
together the agree and somewhat it
somewhat agree you could argue whether
it's fair to do that but
i'm going to do it in this case so i'm
adding together the people who are
leaning toward agreeing and agreeing
and democrats 87 percent of them said
they
um they agree with the verdict
87 pretty good now what typically
happens when most of the democrats are
on one side of
anything typically republicans are going
to be on the other side
but not this time 58 percent of
republicans also agreed or somewhat
agreed
with it and that's a pretty strong
majority it's not 87
percent but it is two sides that are
both
strongly on the same side
when was the last time right
really when was the last time that both
republicans and democrats were strongly
on the same side
now imagine if you would scrub down the
effect of the
fake news it's probably just about the
same
if you took the fake news uh effect out
where it sort of drives people to a
to a team instead of looking at the
facts this is probably pretty close
pretty close to something everybody
agrees on somebody in the comments is
saying 911 was the last time i don't
know if that's true
but might be
let's look at some more will the
question rasmussen asked also is will
the floyd verdict make
race relations better
21 of everybody uh this is
likely voters not everybody in the world
but likely american voters
21 said it would make race relations
better
31 thought it would be make things worse
that feels like also a difference in
what
what news you're consuming that doesn't
feel like a real opinion does it
it feels like an assigned opinion a
little bit but there's not much
difference
they're both way less than half they're
both down in that you know quarter or
third range
and here's another one how much did
politics influence the outcome of the
chauvin floyd trial so i added together
the people who said it
politics influenced it a lot and the
people who said it influenced it
somewhat so these are people
you know sort of leading in a direction
or in that direction
gop said that 71 was 71 percent of
uh republicans or
yeah conservatives i don't know it's
about the same
i'm speaking in messy terms gop
conservatives etc but that world 71
percent of them
said politics influenced the outcome
and democrats also said 48 of them said
that
so a little less than half of democrats
but 71 percent of the
conservatives and republicans said that
uh
in politics was in it so i would say in
this case
both sides are strongly 48 is a lot of
people
so even the democrats are kind of
strongly accepting
that politics was a big part of it now
the people who said that politics was
not part of the decision
did they mean it this is the kind of
question
where people kind of answer the way they
want the poll to turn out
i don't know if it's exactly what
they're feeling
or if they want the public to think that
politics did not
influence the outcome because i can't
really believe
you could get more than one in four
people because the one and four will say
anything
but i can't believe that three out of
four people would disagree
on the question of whether politics had
an influence
i feel like anybody who acted like it
wasn't the case was probably acting
that's just speculation
all right so my point is that the
country is
fairly fairly unified
the george floor floyd thing did
something to
uh white minds that was invaluable
i would say for the benefit of the
country certainly invaluable if you were
a black
american and you've been trying to make
this point
and and the point is do you understand
you know what it feels like what what
the life is like
you know what daily life is like what
kind of fear there is
and how real this is do you understand
it white america and the answer before
george floyd was
not really not really
i mean we could hear it we could hear
you talking about it but
you know that's not really persuasive
you can look at some data
and data isn't really persuasive but
when you see it on the video and you see
it over and over again
even though to and i know you're going
to say this in the comments
even though the video might have been a
little misleading
might have been a lot misleading but it
exists
so i'm not going to talk about the the
factual element of it i'm going to talk
about how it makes you feel
and i think that this was the best
um if if george floyd and his family
well let's say his family wants to feel
that his death had
meaning it really did in a positive way
you know you hate to celebrate somebody
who might have had a criminal past and
was on drugs etc
um i'm not condemning him for that stuff
either
i'm just saying normally you don't want
to celebrate somebody who's got a
checkered past
but the truth is that his life for
whatever reason
became the the most
the most accurate communication of
how one group americans were feeling and
the other group
couldn't couldn't feel it couldn't see
it
and then that gap was closed by this
process
is that good for the country i'd say yes
because anything that increases
understanding at such a fundamental
level
and on something that's so important to
the psychology
and the experience of life it's a really
big deal
and i would say that it supports the
golden age hypothesis
that um the the news won't let us
believe this
but this was in fact
probably the most unifying experience
this country has ever had
doesn't feel like it does it because the
news just
wants it to be you know a constant uh
fight
but this was the most unifying thing
i've ever experienced
you know you could say landing on the
moon in 1969 was unifying
but not in the political sense
let's talk about lebron james
um you know a lot of conservatives are
beating up on lebron
especially since he made uh i think he
would
admit it's a mistake he tweeted when the
young lady was shot recently by police
when she was in the act of trying to
stab another young woman
um and lebron was incensed by that and
tweeted that that
that police officer who did the shooting
was next
as if you know he's going to be targeted
but when people looked at the video they
said uh
that looks like he just did a good job
and saved somebody's life
that doesn't look exactly like anything
like the floyd thing
it looked like good police work not bad
police work
so lebron deleted his tweet i think you
probably realized
you know it was a little bit too much of
a claim on that one
but here's my here's my take on lebron
when you're a sports superstar
you're kind of pushed to be a leader
and that's not necessarily what you
signed up for i mean you know it comes
with a job
but i don't know that he equipped
himself
or has the right talent stack shall we
say
for political conversation now does he
have the right talent stack
for basketball oh yeah
i mean ridiculous he has every talent
you could ever have
you know psychologically mentally mental
strength
uh your physicality training dedication
i mean he has
he has the whole freaking package but
what do we know about what he has
learned or what education he's had
and communicating leading understanding
the world
it feels like it's a little short
doesn't it
now not being unkind this should not be
seen as a criticism
because i have great appreciation for
lebron
not only that he's um
i think he's genuine meaning i don't
think he's trying to fool anybody
right he's completely transparent
there's no clever trick or anything to
it
he's telling you exactly what he feels
you can disagree with it
you can think he's you know maybe not
quite as sophisticated in his opinion as
it could or should be
but i don't think you should doubt his
intentions have you ever seen anything
from him that would suggest his
intentions are bad
and i feel like that has to matter right
i just don't think you can judge people
who may do things differently than you
would do them
if they have the same intention you have
which is to make things better
right now okay i'm seeing people
criticizing lebron for being dumb blah
blah blah blah
but let me ask you this is he so much
different
and i'm going to make an argument here
that he has the same
problem that trump had and i use that
analogy
knowingly provocatively what was the
biggest problem that trump had as
president it was the fake news wasn't it
if if the fake news didn't exist what
would
trump's uh term have looked like
completely differently
you know you would interpret everything
you did in a different light if fake
news didn't exist
but fake news does exist and it's
affecting all of us it's not just
affecting
you know ex-presidents lebron
is a victim he's a victim i mean it
seems weird because he's a
zillionaire famous athlete top of his
game
but on this specific thing i believe
that the fake news created in him
a set of feelings and emotions and
beliefs that made it easy for him to
misinterpret this next event
the shooting of the young woman i i
think his filter
was just off a little bit and he knows
it
i mean he knows it now but his filter
was a little off but was that his fault
was it is that lebron's fault
that the entire news industry is feeding
fake news and he believed
or he sort of bought into the emotional
package is that really his fault
i don't know i don't know i feel as
though
um i think we should give him a break on
this he's got skin in the game
he's trying to help he pulled back his
tweet when people complained
he's being responsive he's fully
transparent
i say give lebron a break i feel he's
one of the good ones
even if you would have played it
differently now i see some complaints
about him
supporting china blah blah that's a
different story
and i feel like you can treat them
separately you know we'll talk about
that
someday but um you know that that's a
tough one
all right but it's a different story let
me ask you this
uh if we're trying to figure out if this
is
the golden age and by the way
keep in mind that my larger theme for
today is that we have achieved the
we're in the golden age but we just
can't see it clearly
because of the fake news
this lebron story is all positive
but somehow it turned negative because
the way we like to argue about stuff
having a famous sports star who is very
concerned about
an issue of great concern is not a
problem
the fact that he didn't play it the way
you would have played it maybe he made a
mistake in public
looks like he's doing what he can to
correct it that's not bad
this is the sort of conflict you want
you don't want no conflict
you want productive conflict and this is
it
all right um can both of these
statements be true
here is me screwing people's uh
psychology up
to try to in a productive way i'm trying
to
i'm trying to shake up people's thinking
and i asked these
this question on twitter and man you
should look at the comments
talk about uh
yeah somebody says that lebron should
apologize to the officer
or he should wait until there's an
official ruling
right um yeah i think an apology would
be called for
but um that's a small problem at this
point
all right so can both of these
statements be true
number one systemic and direct racism
are serious problems in america
now i'm not saying that you believe that
necessarily some of you don't
i happen to believe it's true um
as i define it right everybody defines
these things a little differently
but as i would define these terms
definitely true
that there's systemic and direct racism
and it's a serious problem in america
number two can this also be true at the
same time
that being black in america in 2021
which is important to the point
is an economic advantage if
and if it's important here if you
approach it strategically
can both of those statements be true
that there is lots of racism and a
serious problem
but being black in america is an
economic advantage
if you approach it strategically now
what that means i'll just give you one
example
a strategic way to approach it would be
to become try to become let's say you
had a background in communication and
i don't know political theory or
something
what would be the most strategic thing
you could do if you were black in
america
in 2021 and you wanted to find
your advantage become a republican
right have you noticed
it's hard to notice that 100 of black
republicans are doing well
has anybody noticed that i mean
obviously i'm lying when i say 100
because nothing's 100
but whenever whenever i see anybody who
has a
a republican point of view and is also
black
how well are they accepted by
republicans
100 tim scott is you know gonna give
some
big speech uh if he ran for president
could
tim scott a black republican
could he become elected president in
this party of all these
racist republicans of course he could
totally he just has to have the
philosophy
republicans don't give a rat's ass about
anything
but are you following the same set of
rules do you like our constitution
are you going to take it seriously we're
done
you know a little religion on top bonus
bonus didn't need it wasn't necessary
i i don't bring you any religious
beliefs and you accept me
most of you are conservative or
republicans if i know my audience
so it's really easy
to be you know not a hundred percent
compatible with the republican thought
but if you buy into the constitution
part and the
you know self-determination and some of
the just basics of
of you know taking responsibility
republicans love you there's no problem
at all
and it's just the fake news that would
make you think this would ever be
a problem now let's say that you're
black in america but you don't want to
become a republican
you know there's some issues there what
would be another strategic thing you
could do
get your education as best you can our
school system is terrible
but as best you can and then find out
that corporate america prefers you
every time because corporate america is
under diversified
they know they have to fix it a
qualified black candidate walks in the
door
gets the job every time is first in line
for a promotion
right now that doesn't change the fact
that maybe there are infinite
small businesses that would discriminate
and
you know if you go into the i'll just
pick one random example
if a black man walks into a korean uh
grocery store in an urban area can the
black guy get a job in the korean
grocery store
sometimes yes but there might be a
little extra racism involved in the
hiring i don't
so nobody would doubt that but then just
use your
strategy and go where it's the opposite
where you would be
picked first strategic advantage
so i put this out here because it's the
fake news that wants to hide
this important point which i believe
is a good indicator of the golden age
somebody says that's why you didn't get
promoted scott yeah if you're
white in america and you're in a
corporation
you do have a disadvantage that's just a
fact
it's a disadvantage um but
if you were anywhere outside of that
corporate world maybe it's an advantage
because maybe racism works in your favor
somehow
it's not obvious how but i could i can
imagine there's an argument there
so there's that all right
what would happen i'll just just put out
this idea what would happen if the
people who don't believe in hoaxes in in
both the left and the right got together
now it's not going to happen because the
fake news will keep us apart
but both parties
are trying to paint uh the moderates in
the party
as belonging to the extremists who are
crazy and believe in hoaxes
all right so there there's some crazy
hoaxes on the right
there are some crazy hoaxes on the left
and both sides would like you to believe
that their opponent is all the believers
of hoaxes when in fact it's probably
just some
now what would happen if the people who
don't believe in any hoaxes
left or right decided to get together
could they move the needle now i don't
know if it'll ever happen
but we are seeing as i'm seeing this in
the comments too
we're seeing that the fake news business
is losing a lot of its power
because people like me people like tim
poole
glenn greenwald you know anybody who
would be more independent
is becoming a growing force and as those
into
independent voices get bigger the power
of the fake news will just
it will start to look increasingly
ridiculous
i mean it looks pretty ridiculous now
yeah bill maher
free thinker so i think the free
thinkers
are maybe starting to organize
you know i have to tell you there's this
thing going on under the hood
you know the thing that you don't see in
which the
independent thinkers are self-organizing
meaning that people like me uh
are being introduced to other people
like me
and there's this sort of network forming
an informal network of people who just
know other people
who are not hoax believers and
it's a thing now how powerful that
becomes
i don't know but i can tell you that if
i see another independent voice
you know whether it's a matt tybee
whoever it is
that i will amplify it you know if it's
a good point and it's an
independent voice i'll amplify it
likewise a lot of those people will
amplify me
and so you're seeing you're seeing a
growth of the reasonable middle
that you don't notice yet because what
you can't see
is how networked we are
and as that networking increases it's
all under the hood you can't see any of
it because it's just one to one
you know some person introducing
somebody etc
somebody follows somebody on twitter you
don't see it forming but there
is a big reasonable
non-hoax believing center
i don't want to say intellectual that's
too smarmy sounding
but there's something forming and it's a
good thing
all right
bonsai sharma in his tweet
he's a that's twitter name is banzai
sharma uh talks about a new pew research
in which uh banzai says this the survey
tells you a lot about how democrats
think now i would add to that
because of the opinions that have been
assigned to them by the media
and bonsai goes on says they are
terribly concerned about gun violence
so the the survey shows that gun
violence is
at the top of uh concerns for democrats
so they're very concerned about gun
violence but they're not much concerned
about violent crime
so this is a the democrats came out in
the poll
right at the top gun violence yet the
the issue of violent crime very low
and a bunch of stuff in between that
they care about more
now is this not an obvious case
where you can see that these opinions
are manufactured by the fake news
because the fake news has told them to
care about guns but it didn't tell them
to care about violent crime
if it had those two things would be at
the top
but because of the way the coverage
works these two things which really
should have been
they should have moved exactly together
they got separated
one's at the top and one's at the bottom
it's actually
laughably absurd to imagine the
democrats are forming their own opinions
on these topics
it's obvious they're not the the press
coverage
completely you know made two things
which are the same
the top and the bottom of the survey and
you can see it as clearly as day
so i feel as if
the people on the left can't ignore
forever
that this is happening and you know the
people on the right is happening too but
you know since i don't have an example
to show you today
actually i will show you an example
later believe it or not i do have one
so jake tapper tweeted today that it was
a year ago
that he and then he showed the video
that is rupard
rupard meaning that is edited to reverse
or change his meaning and the rupard
video
seemed to show president trump
suggesting
you know drinking or ingesting
disinfectants
for covet that of course never happened
what happened was that trump knew about
a new experimental technology
involving uvc light in which it would be
injected by trachea
into your into your trachea by a
ventilator-like device and there was
talk about
maybe you could extend it into the lungs
but that wasn't what was being worked on
at the moment
so trump actually knew more than dr
burks about
this new experimental thing
that's just the fact because he talked
about it
very specifically you know could he use
a type of light
inject it into the body it was in the
news that month
i tweeted it i know it was in the news
because i discussed it
on periscope and i tweeted it a few
times
so it was a real thing trump knew about
it dr burks
did not and so the news treated it as
though berks
who did not know about it was the smart
one
and the trump who actually knew about it
was the dumb one
they totally rupart it they reversed the
meaning
and the way that they did that is they
edit out
the beginning of what trump said where
he clarifies he's talking about light
says it directly and then he makes a
bunch of comments blah blah blah
and then at the end he bookends it by
making sure you knew he was talking
about light
if you take off the end and the
beginning where he clarified he was
talking about light
all you have is the middle in which he
uses the word disinfectant
and then that became the fake news all
right
if you didn't know that um
so here's what gets interesting
so i of course tweeted this to correct
it and i included the article
showing that researchers at cedars-sinai
uh
were actually testing it it has a name
it's called
heel light platform they were inserting
it into the trachea exactly as i said
and but here's the just mind-boggling
amazing thing
when i went to look for a link to
include in this story
because it was a twitter exchange i
found the usa today
fact check on it and i'm still shaking
my head because it's like
this is amazing all right here's how usa
today
no friend to the president president
trump i mean um here's how they
handled this do you think that they said
oh president trump was completely right
there is a technology that exists
do you think they did that let me tell
you how they handle the fact check
and if this doesn't make your head
explode
i don't know what will all right you
ready for this
this is mind-boggling all right um
so here's the claim so usa today sets it
up this way
the claim that researchers are exploring
a medical device that would use uv-a
as a potential tool for treating
treatment in covet-19 patients
is true according to statements from
cedar sinai medical center
so they start by saying that it's true
that this technology exists the one that
president trump was referring to
but the presentation of that news
includes a false headline
because it's premature to say at this
point that the technology is quote
to be used
as a treatment so apparently there was a
hollywood l a news headline
that said the that it was to be used as
a treatment
but it was only being tested so they
fact-checked it as
false because some headlines
which had nothing to do with what trump
said just somebody wrote a headline
somewhere
so the headline had the wrong use of
words
for a true story which president trump
was right about
in the context of his own advisors and
the entire news industry
being completely wrong about here's how
that fact check should have run the
president made a claim about some
technology or asked some questions about
it
it exists here it is
interestingly his advisors the experts
were unaware
of this thing that trump knew about
accurately
that's what that's what the fact check
should have said but they found
some way to turn it false
and the way they did was launder it
through an obscure publication called
the hollywood la news
never heard of it to say that their
headline was slightly wrong
and therefore the fact checking
says it was a false claim
what it was the most
true claim ever and they found some
weird way
to make some element of it that had
nothing to do with trump
untrue when you see how much torture
they have to do to themselves
to make trump look bad i tell you
history will not be kind to the fake
news
all right here's another one uh there's
a this this is another rupaur
so there's a video in which bill gates
is talking about
the economic uh profit from vaccinations
whoa that's trouble right
because bill gates is pro vaccinations
and he's talking about the 20 to 1
economic
profit oh this is bad
right because this indicates that he's
in it for the money
and so then safety's not important
that's what it says right so that's what
somebody sent to me and said well scott
do you keep defending bill gates in
effect
but here he is in his own words saying
he's in it for the money
no no he didn't
this is a rhupar the video in which he's
talking about the 20 to 1 economic
benefit
is for society not for bill gates
he's saying that there's a 20 to 1
economic advantage for any
country or society that vaccinates it's
obvious that's the context you don't
even have to go
research it anybody should know that's
the obvious well not anybody
here's where it helps to have a
background in economics
he couldn't have been talking about
himself it's just ridiculous to imagine
that that was the context
so i don't even have to research it to
know the context with society
and i tweeted it if you want to look for
yourself so here's somebody who got
totally rupard
they saw a video and a context and
believed bill gates was saying in his
own words he was in this vaccine thing
for the money
let me say something as clearly as i can
if you think bill gates is in any of
this
anything anything he's doing right now
if you think any of it is for his own
personal profit
you're really misled i mean you're
seriously
you're on the wrong planet because he
doesn't need money
that's the one thing he doesn't need
he's trying to give it away
he's giving away ninety percent of his
wealth and he's talking other rich
people into doing the same thing
nothing could be more opposite than bill
gates is in it for the money
there is no more false claim that's ever
been made
in the history of the world than bill
gates is in it for the money
in 2021 obviously when he made his money
he was in it for the money
here we see craig
hell no he's a eugenicist
there is no evidence of that and if you
think that he's a eugenicist
in in light of zero evidence of that
and lots of evidence that he's sort of
left-leaning and
wants everybody to do great it's amazing
that you could have that opinion just
amazing and i would say that you're not
in the group of reasonable people who
don't believe hoaxes
if you believe q anon is true if you
believe
that uh bill gates is in it for the
money and he's a eugenicist
um and i'm seeing people yelling in all
caps
open your eyes look at my track record
of calling out hoaxes and then look at
your own
compare all right if i'm wrong about
this
and this one's easy this one's not hard
bill gates is not in it because he's a
eugenicist
he might like birth control
that's pretty far from being a
eugenicist
right a lot of people think birth
control is a good thing
and they don't believe they're
eugenicists
somebody says abortion is eugenics well
you can disagree all you are with
abortion uh but you're making crazy
arguments about bill gates anyway
so bill gates is helping the world but
half
half of republicans think he's got some
evil plan
uh here's some more good news david
boxenhorn is reporting on this a lot on
twitter
that mrna vaccination the the platform
the and the the technology looks like
there's a new vaccination that looks
promising
77 effective against malaria
wow so one of the things that's going to
come out of this
pandemic is that this mrna
technology might cure a bunch of other
stuff and malaria's
right at the top so malaria kills 400
000 people a year so if you take a 77
bite into that that's a pretty good deal
let's see the other thing that's good is
i believe the public is finally coming
around to understanding the news is not
real
and that's a big deal because if we keep
believing the news
is even intended to be real as
inaccurate and
unbiased you're going to be real
confused in life
you have to you have to achieve that
level of understanding that the news is
not even
intended to be real before you can
make any progress really i mean you'll
just be locked in you're
in a weird little fake world if you
think that's the case
but technologies or services like sub
stack where independents
can say what they want locals i'm an
investor in that
locals is another subscription service
where i can say what i want
you would believe the things i can say
on locals that have never gotten into
the wild
i was complimenting the people who
followed me in locals the other day
because i've i've said and done some
pretty provocative things
that you just couldn't do on twitter
without getting cancelled
but that group has not released any of
that to the wild
somehow they've they've been and there
are thousands of them right
64 6500 followers
on locals and none of them have copied
my
content from there and put it in twitter
where i would get canceled now i don't
know how that's gone so long without
that happening it feels like
you know some bad apple will get in
there somehow and just to do that
but so far it's completely worked
and i'm surprised
so the economy is doing great we were
worried about
the deficit but i just don't know how
much to worry about that
we've got doctors on video now we didn't
have that a year ago
so you know medical advice at least is
is going to be
more universal we've got remote work
i don't think people are going back i
think remote work is a thing
it's going to have a good effect on
traffic i think that the
school choice thing just hit a is
starting to come into its own
you know corey deangelis especially
doing a great job persuading on that
i do what i can but it does look like
both the left and the right
are saying uh we need more school
options or better schools school's a
mess
there's even an lgbtq activists
who say that the current public schools
are no good because they get bullied et
cetera
i agree with all of that i think the
lgbtq community
as well as conservatives as well as lots
of people
need more options they need more options
now i'm not saying that you want
separate schools for lgbtq that seems
like a very bad idea
but wouldn't it be a good idea for some
people
to have the option right and
um there does seem to be some movement
on this um
the teachers unions so we'll see a lot
of work to be done
um there don't seem to be any wars on
the horizon
am i wrong about that you know the news
is sort of working hard to find to find
us a war
but they're failing they they can't they
can't get us into war in afghanistan
we're done with it
the middle east it's a flare-up now and
then
but even iran it looks like that's going
to be israel's problem maybe
and it'll be it'll be a short process if
they decide to
to take out their nuclear facilities i
feel as if
we have never been safer
um i think that russia and ukraine will
not turn into a world war
i think that china and the south pacific
sea will not turn into a world war
because the the superpowers with nukes
just don't want to fight each other
i just don't see it's going to happen so
yeah you know israel dropped some bombs
on some
syrian missile batteries that that'll
happen forever
but um yeah even if you look at the the
hottest of the hot spots
you know taiwan ukraine
none of them look like they're going to
become a world war
and none of them look like they're
necessarily going to bring drag america
into it
we'll see i mean anything could happen
right
but i feel as if we're in the most
peaceful time
maybe of my life let's hope it holds
um you know you've got the abraham
accords in the middle east
we're probably one ayatollah away from a
better situation with iran
the ayatollah isn't going to live
forever now whoever replaces them might
be just as bad or worse
but at least that's an opening something
might happen
and i would argue that people are
starting to understand the subjective
nature of reality
do you remember five years ago the first
time you heard the idea of the
simulation
it seemed ridiculous and it's already
entering the mainstream of thought
do you remember when you first heard
that the news is fake
you probably didn't believe it but now
you know it's true
how many times have you thought
something was true and then had your
mind completely changed you know a day
or a week later
a bunch of times and i would i would
argue that our understanding of
our reality as being subjective
is more so than it's ever been which is
a good thing
nextly not a word but let's say it is
nextly i'm going to claim that the
idea of systems versus goals is really
big
and it has changed america
does anybody want to argue with that i
want to see some pushback of that
it's a big claim so i'm saying that my
book had failed almost everything and
still win big
has changed so much
in america that it's a major force
that it actually is something that you
can talk about as being a big deal
and a trend i think if you saw how many
books
it influenced and how many people talk
this way now
that didn't used to five years ago if
you said
passion was the most important thing for
success what would people
say they say yeah that's true you need
your passion
what do they say now now they say
passion is
right if anybody talks about it at all
there's about a fifty percent chance
they're going to talk about it
negatively
five years ago it would have only been
positive it's a big big change
now i'm only part of that but i am part
of it part of the
passion being overrated what about the
fact that persuasion is more important
than facts
what was the most important five years
ago you
everything was uh facts don't care about
your feelings right
let's get the facts the facts are
important five years ago
how do people feel today today pretty
much
everyone knows that the facts don't
matter when we talked about the george
floyd
uh case the shoving case didn't
everybody agree
that the facts would not be the
determinant of the outcome
what have you ever seen that before the
left the right
everybody we all agreed that people
would ignore the facts
even though this was one of those case
with cases with more facts than just
about anything
yeah micro also talks about uh
passion being bs etc right yeah
so i would say the you know not taking
you know some kind of universal credit
for any of this i'm saying that i'm part
of
a larger trend of systems being more
important than goals
habits being more important than
objective
subjectivity of our experience passion
being
these are all things that really weren't
big five years ago but they're big now
and i think i'm uh one of the larger
reasons for that um
let me see what you said the fact that
he didn't die of an overdose
got a shove and convicted well
i don't understand that comment all
right sorry about that
uh okay my devices are all talking to me
today
all right so that's what's going on and
i would say that we are entering
the golden age we're putting stuff on
the moon
we don't have a war happening my
my stocks are higher than they've ever
been
and i would say that our understanding
of the world is better than it's ever
been
and i believe that our uh
our our racism level in this country is
the lowest it's ever been
and going lower i would say it's
trending lower now you could argue
but no they've just replaced it with
racism against white people
that's true that's true
there's way more racism against white
people but we can handle it
right we can handle it it's not it's not
the worst problem in the world
it's it's annoying it's inconvenient
and probably some people are going to go
to jail that didn't need to so
you know but it's not the biggest thing
that's that's happening
all right uh somebody say it's the
golden age until
i love this coffin uh
brian says it's the golden age until
fred
franz ferdinand gets assassinated
uh you are totally right things can
change in a moment
just like that but
um i believe that the pandemic was
absolutely necessary
to get us here what did the pandemic
give us
a whole bunch of new technologies for
handling pandemics
that's pretty big a whole bunch of new
technology for
vaccinations from malaria to god knows
aids
what's next that's gigantic
remote work as now as standard as
opposed to an exception
that's really big that is so so
big i mean i've been writing about
cubicles for 30 years
a lot of people got out of their cubicle
really recently that's
big and like i said the floyd trial put
people on the same side
it's the first time white people really
really got to
to feel the emotional
part of the argument you know not just
statistics um
yeah and the economy is doing well and i
think we've never been better
school choice would we have would we
have as much school choice
if the pandemic hadn't messed up the
school
habit no
if you would we have uh would we have
doctors available by video
across state lines nope these are all
things that happened in the last year
because of the pandemic the pandemic
is a crisis which created
amazing opportunities which are
permanent
this is the best time we've ever been in
now unfortunately like everything it is
not distributed
evenly it is not distributed evenly
tj says wow delusional talk
what part is wrong tj see i would argue
that anybody who thinks things are bad
is being hypnotized by their new source
the news only exists by telling you bad
news
the news could not make money telling
you good news
and i have also a hypothesis that every
time a new
video camera is added to the world you
think the world is worse
because what is the video camera going
to show you good news
never video shows you bad news
that's what's interesting good news
isn't as interesting
oh sure we see some puppies and stuff
but mostly bad news
so every time there's a new camera that
enters the world
there's a new possibility this people
will see more bad news
so your impression of the world might be
at the all-time worst
the world itself is at an all-time best
so those of you are saying my god this
guy's crazy
everything's falling apart can't he see
it
no i can't i can't see it because it's
not there
the world is by far better than it's
ever been
not even close and this year
the one we're entering we hate the masks
we
you know we honor the the dead if you
will the the people who did not make it
through the pandemic
but the fact is this this shook the box
in exactly the way the box needed to be
shaken
and we've never been in a better
situation
all right yeah if you're not
looking for the golden age you won't see
it
if you're believing the the news you'll
never see it
where the where china has the most power
on earth this is your paradise
well tj did you say that about japan
in the 60s i did
was it the 60s 70s 80s whatever it was
when
when it was obvious that japan was going
to be the world power
because they were they were growing fast
and you know you could just look at the
curves and say uh oh
japan's going to eat our lunch they'll
have all of our technology
what happened didn't happen did it
didn't happen at all why is china doing
so well
stealing our technology they're doing so
well because we're letting them
what happens if we stop letting them
meaning stop letting them steal our
technology
stop import exporting our jobs stop
buying their
cheap stuff stop letting them abuse our
industries
what happens if we stop because
even biden's you know going to be
cautious about china
yeah if you straight line any problem
oh china's getting bigger if nothing
ever changed
pretty big problem but something always
changes
so don't worry about a straight line
trend it always changes
and i would argue
that if you're worried about one of
those problems you're probably consuming
too much news from one side
although the china thing is real uh it's
it's easily handleable in my opinion
japan does not want to kill us and
somebody says that china does
not true china doesn't want to kill
anybody
where did you even get that china wants
to dominate
and china wants to control its own fate
but do you think china wants to own
denmark
i don't think so i don't think china
wants to own denmark
i i think their ambitions are really
about their area
just like everybody else's
bobo says uh oh is this a racist comment
let me read it first
what is your opinion on hypothetical oh
this is so provocative
free therapy for black people sounds a
little racist hold on
as a form of reparations
well you're making a big assumption
there
you're making a big assumption that a
that somehow black people will be extra
benefited from therapy
i don't know that that's the case i
would guess that everybody needs therapy
lately
but i don't think therapy is the right
word or the right way to frame it
uh could could black americans be
happier
if their situation were presented to
them in a strategic framework
which gives them all the opportunity in
the world it's just there's a bunch of
things that are still bad
or a victim framework in which
everybody's doomed
so we should certainly go from victim to
strategy
but i don't think therapy is the right
approach
that's just insulting and racist
feeling even if you didn't mean it that
way
somebody says so fentanyl is not a
problem well
fentanyl is a big problem yeah so the
country is not free of
problems uh
but you know i think we'll we'll figure
a way around all of it
do you believe china is trying to kill
us with fentanyl oh
that's true yes but i would say that
that has more to do with uh
harming us economically i don't think
china wants us dead
i think they don't care but they want us
less powerful and
fentanyl is part of that so yes they
they are
they are the cause of death in america
that's true
and it has to be dealt with all right
that's all i've
got for now and i will talk to you
tomorrow
