hey
everybody come on in here I am only
recently
awakened so I might be a little Dopey
this morning and by that I mean dopier
than
usual
so let's start with um Senator McCain
who's passed away and
we wish the best for his family and
honor his
service I know some of you have
competing opinions but we won't talk
about them
today all right so there's a story
forming that might be the most
interesting story in the world that I
haven't seen
reported so I'm going to report the
story as I see it forming
and I want to see if uh you think I'm
crazy or if it's the only thing that
matters and it goes like
this do you remember when the president
got elected and there was a lot of talk
about whether he was going to go hard to
put Hillary Clinton in
jail and pretty much everybody said that
would be a bad idea even if you could
because you don't want to become
president and then immediately jail the
person you ran against I can't think of
a less healthy thing for the
Republic so it seems to me that although
there were plenty of avenues to
pursue uh there were there were enough
things that looked illegal to the
untrained eye and maybe the trained eye
as well that there were plenty of
avenues they could have gone and even if
there was nothing there that she did
illegal that we could
see we already know from the president
Trump experience and from every other
experience where you have lots of
Investigations if you dig long enough
you can find
something so you had this situation of
the president I believe holding off and
and playing soft with Hillary Clinton
even though he didn't need to but
because it was better politics better
for the country probably wouldn't get
that much
support um so it would be you know
impractical to go after
her now fast forward to
today today we have a situation in which
many of um of Hillary
Clinton's personal friends and allies
for
decades appear to be organizing
to put president Trump out of
office now here's the interesting
part you see President Trump going
really tough on Jeff
sessions but not firing him interesting
right he's going really hard at sessions
especially for not going after Hillary
but he's not firing
him and then we see uh everything from
David pecker to uh to wasberg
you know uh having immunity to Cohen
having immunity and people are saying
wait a minute the you know the the vice
is closing on the
president let me ask you this and I
haven't seen this I've not seen any
reporting on this
what would happen if they actually got
the president on something
serious well between the time that the
president knew that he was going down
this is hypothetical let's imagine that
they found something in his his business
or something that was
problematic he would have a number of
months of being in
power before they before he was
technically out of
office what would he
do well I think he would employ mutually
assured
destruction not of the world but of of
Hillary
Clinton it seems to me he's setting up
the situation to make it clear that if
he goes down he's going to have plenty
of time to take Hillary down and here's
here's how he' do it fire Jeff session
and there's there's tons of political
blowback but who
cares you know because this would be the
point where it doesn't matter anymore he
has nothing to lose he's going to fire
Jeff sessions he's going to put somebody
in if he can get them approved who will
do nothing but take Hillary
down
so it seems to me that by threatening
Jeff sessions but not moving on it he's
sending the clearest message possible
that if the Deep State takes him out
he's going to take Hillary
out but maybe even
better if they take him out and let's
say he doesn't have time to take out
Hillary the next Republican is going to
do
it right it doesn't matter who the next
Republican president is whether it's uh
Pence or somebody who gets elected in 8
years or 12 years it doesn't matter how
long it
takes the next Republican is going to
take Hillary
out because you have to you don't really
have a choice do you I mean you could
run on that platform just say look uh
I'm just going to do one thing I'm going
to get elected I'm going to appoint a uh
special prosecutor and I'm going to take
Hillary out just
just to even things up uh I think the
the desire for Revenge would be so high
that it might
happen anyway here's here's my
prediction my prediction is
this if the
president Dodges all of the bullets that
seem to be heading his
way then I think that Hillary Clinton
will not be
prosecuted I think that if the president
if if they do find something that they
can drum him out of office for or
prosecute him for after he's out of
office I believe the Hillary is going
down and I think that there's nothing
that can stop it because it would be
Priority One at that point now if he
gets rid of sessions I think um there's
a problem there because you have to get
the next attorne Attorney General
approved by Congress and presumably they
would you know stall if they could
but does it take a bare majority I'm not
sure the rule there because if it's just
a majority the Republicans would say all
right this one's on
You full majority we've got a new
attorney general attorney general only
has one job take Hillary
out um now that might also take out the
Deep State as
well but I think Hillary is now in the
crosshairs and you may have noticed that
the president has one named her she used
to be crooked Hillary two words but
lately he's gone to calling her crooked
and you know who he's talking about so
he's now she's like he's like Sher and
Madonna and
Elvis just one name just
crooked all
right this does sound insane Scott which
part of it sounds insane do you think
there there's any chance that Hillary
wouldn't go down if president Trump goes
down there's no chance I'm telling you
now if president Trump goes down
Hillary's going to jail for her own
crimes not for anything that had to do
with Trump it's it's a
guaranteed
100% Hillary behind
bars if Trump gets impeached and
actually removed from office so that's
my that's that's my theory um so which
is a good reason to imagine that he
won't be taken
out now I saw a study somebody tweeted
to me recently saying that uh there's a
brain
difference between Republicans or let's
say conservatives and
liberals and that one of the key
differences is
that uh
cons
conservatives excuse
me the
conservatives
are uh more triggered by external threat
so if there's something from outside the
country for example that's an external
threat whether it's communism or nuclear
stuff or Russia or whatever um in theory
conservatives are more triggered by fear
of something from the
outside so it makes sense that
conservatives like a big
military and likewise it said um
slightly different point but that
liberals um are happier in situations of
uncertainty in other words you don't
know exactly what's going to happen and
they're fine with that and a couple
examples of that would be um open
Borders or
socialism the the two things
that those have in common is what the
hell is going to happen if you do those
things and Liberals are more likely to
say h let's give it a try in other words
they like they like variety they like
Risk they like uncertainty or at least
they can deal with it better so that's
very powerful because if those things
are true it
suggests um ways
to yeah it suggests ways to uh persuade
so it suggests that President Trump's
approach of saying immigration's going
to get us and terrorists are going to
get us close the borders close the
borders it suggests that that's exactly
the right message for winning the
nomination but that it's
problematic
convincing um the other
side
so but it also suggests some
opportunities take for example
Healthcare you might be able to sell
healthc care without explaining the
details at least explaining it to the to
the left so you could say for example
hey we're just going to use the um
technical achievements and better
thinking and be smarter and we're going
to try some experiments with Healthcare
and the left would probably say oh yeah
experiments we like that
uh let's try a few things let's do some
things we've never done before so you
could probably sell a a thing you've
never done before would be easier to
sell to the left so there might be some
ways to use that all right I believe as
I've just been reminded that you have
not en not yet enjoyed the simultaneous
Sip and
so if you could Raise Your Glass raise
your mug your vessel full of beverage
and join me for the simultaneous
sip oh that's
good yes my chalice thank you for adding
that to the mix I raise my
chalice you know there's a sentence I've
never said before I raise my
chalice um
it SCS in panic mode about what about
the
presidency um I'm still of the
camp that people are panicking about the
presidency but that the risk is far less
than you think and let me give you some
examples so we're talking about the risk
that David pecker of the inquire has an
a Secret Safe full of secrets about the
president well that's probably true but
that's not going to kick him out of
office even if we saw the safe full of
secrets what difference would it make
cuz it's all going to be personal life
stuff but more
importantly on what basis would the
special Council
have to make a case about any of that
stuff so in theory the special counsel
will not publicize any of you know the
personal stuff that's in the safe cuz
that's not their job they're not into
personal stuff so you're never going to
hear about it from the you the special
counsel and David Becker he has no
reason to tell the world who else is
going to look at
it so it seems to me that there's
probably a safe full of secrets that
will remain a safe full of secrets yeah
maybe somebody whispers about it
somebody else saw it big deal so I think
the safe has no risk
I won't say no risk cuz that you know
nothing has no risk but close to
zero then you've got the risk of Cohen
that Cohen knows more than we already
know but I think he would have hinted
that or said that and so far Mueller
hasn't even talked to Cohen as far as we
know sounds like there's not much risk
there at
all yeah at least nothing no smoking G
nothing that we can see and Lanny Davis
doesn't seem to be hinting that there's
anything special that Cowen
knows then you've got wasberg who got
immunity to testify but it looks like
the immunity was just limited to stuff
we already knew about
Cohen so the wasberg thing it's probably
a big
nothing um and what would happen if the
wasberg Thing extended into the finances
of the Trump
Corporation well that's the red
line I think if they cross that red
line um everybody knows that's when the
Deep State goes down and that's when
Hillary goes to
jail I think quite literally if you see
the special counsel going after the
Trump taxes the you know the Trump
business I think that's when Hillary
Goes to Jail that's when sessions gets
fired that's when the new attorney
general or the acting attorney general
comes in now let's say the acting
attorney
general would be which would be
Rosenstein right let's say he doesn't go
after
Hillary he gets fired who's third in
line it doesn't matter that person gets
fired too if they don't go after Hillary
so the
president can pretty much guarantee that
Hillary goes to
jail for the s in exactly the same way
that the special prosecutor if they just
kept digging everywhere in the world
they'd find something that looks
illegal so I think that's probably the
mutually assured destruction line and
I'm pretty sure that Mueller and
everybody else knows where that line
is you and I know where the line is
right it's pretty it's pretty certain
they know where the line is so given
that the biggest risk RS are the ones I
just
mentioned and they're actually a lot
smaller than you
think because wasberg isn't going to be
talking about anything we don't already
know about or Müller doesn't already
know about Cohen's already shot his wad
there's probably nothing
left and Pecker's safe will probably
remain locked because nobody cares about
that stuff from a legal perspective it's
just not important
so and then Amarosa is completely
discredited even CNN stopped talking
about Amarosa you know even they can't
sell her her stuff
anymore so what would be the the risk if
those are the biggest risks I see them
as closer to zero than
50% you know nothing's everever
z00 but I think his risk is closer to
zero than to
50% did you see I don't I can't tell if
it was a fake headline or not but on
MSNBC there was the whatever you call it
the Chiron or the the label running at
the bottom of the
screen and it literally
said uh Trump worried about Trump is
worried about pecker
Elite Trump is worried that pecker will
leak something like that
really worried that pecker will
leak well that's pretty good was it fake
that might have been fake whether it was
fake or real it's just as
funny all
right so the rest of the uh news cycle
will be dedicated to stories about John
McCain coupled with stories about isn't
President Trump a terrible person for
not saying that McCain was a
hero let me tell you how I feel about
that President Trump and John
McCain were legitimate
enemies they were they were legitimate
enemies they didn't like each other
politically
and it's pretty obvious they didn't like
each other
personally would you be happier if the
president was a big phony and came out
saying you know glowing things about
McCain because he
died I don't know that I would like that
better you know I think we all agree
with
honoring uh veterans and honoring his
service and I did that in the beginning
of my uh periscope in case you missed
it but would you want the president to
be a gigantic
phony and to say things that you know he
didn't mean I don't want that I don't
want that at
all um I think the president played it
exactly the way I'd want he said
something so it's better to say
something than nothing and he showed his
empathy for the family because he
doesn't have any beef with the family
and they're the ones who are both alive
and suffering the most so if you're
going to say something that was a
sufficiently respectful thing to
say and all the rumors that are going to
be floating about the bad things that
mcain allegedly did you're just going to
see every good and bad thing about him
today so um I have
I'm having trouble creating an
opinion so you can like you can like the
parts about McCain that you know about
you know his his service for
example you can like all of that and
respect all of that but there a lot of
accusations that I wouldn't know if
they're true or false wouldn't have any
way of
knowing um
now here's something about Trump that's
interesting this seems like a
dichotomy and it goes like
this um president Trump has kept more
promises than perhaps any candidate ever
for
president at the same time his record
with the fact Checkers is the worst
we've ever
seen but I've AR ued that he is
always and I think this is true I think
it's true that it's always true
directionally
accurate
and um yeah I'm going to give you a uh a
whiteboard talk
here I wasn't planning to do this so
we're a little bit unprepared
you don't need to know what this
is that was me trying to learn the
J to play the drums
unsuccessfully all right so let's say
you're trying to figure out who's a
genius and who's an
idiot all right
a g a genius would be somebody who when
they're trying to make a
decision would you they might start with
facts and they might use their sense of
reason and
then so they they'd start to make their
own decision say let's say their own
decision they would use facts and
reasons
um and then what would they do to
persuade I'm going to leave that blank
for
now um how would an idiot persuade now
an idiot would persuade with um things
that were untrue they'd fail the fact
checking fail the fact
checking big time
and they would probably use a lot of
hyperbole which you might
call
BS so that's how an idiot would persuade
right they would they would use a bunch
of things that were not true they
wouldn't use facts and reason and stuff
like that but how would a genius
persuade well a genius would persuade
with all kinds of reason and
facts
right so a genius would make a decision
based on facts and reason and then they
would persuade you using facts and
reason right but an idiot would just
have no
facts and then they would use bunch of
BS because they're just
idiots this is your General way of
looking at the
world but I would suggest to
you that that's an idiot
too so I'm fooling
you they're both
idiots so the reason that this person is
an idiot even though they're using facts
and reasons to make their own decisions
using facts and reasons to
persuade why are they an
idiot because this doesn't
work smart people will know this doesn't
work doesn't work if you want to be back
to
genius you want to borrow this
stuff you want to use
Hyperbole and
Bs Etc because it works then you can be
a
genius so now you've made now you've
made decisions based on facts and reason
but you know you can't persuade anybody
so you have to exaggerate use hyperbole
use fear that sort of thing and then
you're a genius but let's say you are an
idiot what would an idiot look
like now I'm going to change it up for
you I got I got to this the long way
sorry let's say an idiot would also use
facts and reasons because idiots don't
know the difference between accurate
reasons and uh that you know an idiot
thinks they're facts and their reasons
are also good so they think they're
starting with us and then they would use
their facts and their reasons to
persuade you but it wouldn't work
because it never does and their facts
and their reasons are wrong so if you
see somebody making a decision using
what they think are the facts and the
reasons and then trying to persuade you
using what they think are the facts and
the reasons that's probably an idiot
because this doesn't work and these are
probably wrong even if it was right it
wouldn't work even if they had the right
facts and reasons because they're not
persuasive
so if you're looking for a genius
looking for look for somebody who makes
their own decisions based on facts but
when they're talking to the public
they're usually
hyperbole um and so
and
so um what you have with President Trump
is this weird
dichotomy this this is something I
should have planned ahead of time
because this is maybe the worst white
board presentation I've ever
done but with President Trump you've got
somebody
who's I got to get better markers
you've got somebody who's failing the
fact
checking more than anybody uh failing
fact checking more than anybody ever
[Music]
has at the same time he's getting
more success he's getting a lot done and
he's got he's a you know he's using his
hyperbole
H Etc so it's not it's not a coincidence
that he's failing the
factchecking and keeping all of his
campaign promises so success in this
case means just his
promises
and I've made the claim that even when
he's failing the factchecking he's
directionally accurate which is what the
hyperbole is and I'd love to
hear I'd love to hear any counter
examples so there probably are some I
just can't think of any I'm trying to
think of a situation in which um I'm
trying
to trying to think of a situation in
which when Trump got a fact
wrong that he didn't get it wrong in the
right direction in other words If he if
he had a fact that was exaggerated or he
said the crowd was bigger than it was
are there any
situations
where um somebody said Hitler was a
genius not true because Hitler started
with incorrect facts so that would that
would not be a situation of a
genius
um he took credit for no Airline
crashes but again when when you see the
president taking credit for things that
maybe his actions were not directly
about what does that
cause you know what's the what's the net
effect of the president taking credit
for something good that happened that
maybe wasn't entirely his
doing well it it doesn't pass the
factchecking but it makes it makes
people think oh things good things are
happening in this country and when
people are happy and they think good
things are happening they invest and all
of a sudden things start working well so
it's perfectly good form for any
president to take credit for things that
weren't exactly things they did it's
very good form they should do that
whenever they can even if other people
say that's not real still works it's
still good
persuasion the birther thing was good
persuasion that didn't didn't pass the
factchecking but at the time he was
trying to become a prominent voice in
the country which he did partly through
that he was trying to bond with the base
which he did and um he was trying to
weaken the president which he did so
that's a perfect example so the birther
stuff didn't pass the factchecking but
Direction Al it accomplished many of the
things he wanted to accomplish and then
when he needed to he said okay I looked
into it you're welcome uh turns out
there was no
problem
um all right I'm just looking and uh so
TR somebody tried to give me an
example uh Trump Tower wir Taps yeah the
wir Taps are an example of something
that was perhaps not technically
factually accurate but it is true that
his campaign was being
surveilled so he was persuading in the
direction toward accuracy even though
the facts were
wrong uh he was forced to give up on the
birther issue
so I I'm not disputing that I'm saying
it didn't matter
that he accomplished what he wanted to
do with the birther issue it made him
prominent it weakened the
president it
worked
um e so somebody said does ethical
matter well let me give you let me uh
give you uh two situations you've got
two leaders one of them passes is the
factchecking and because he's not a very
inspirational leader the economy goes
down and some people starve to
death in this scenario that that leader
is acting perfectly ethically they never
lie but they're also not very inspiring
somebody starves to death let's say
another leader uses some hyperboy gets
people excited gets the economy going
but doesn't pass the
factchecking net result people make
money people have jobs the economy is
better and people
eat which one of these two acted
ethically one of them fed the poor one
of them killed the poor but in order to
feed the poor you had to exaggerate a
little bit you had to you have to lead
you have to get people's minds and their
emotions moving in the right direction
so which of those was the ethical way so
when you say but is it ethical I say
according to whom you know who's who's
uh who's deciding what's ethical I
usually favor keeping children
alive that's just me you might say I'd
rather that kid died rather than hear a
lie I would rather not hear a lie all
right so let me let me give you uh let
me summarize this this
way um the
truth has two
components the
accuracy other words how close is it to
the
truth uh and the
direction so for example if the
President says there were 50,000 people
at my rally and let's say the actual
number was
30,000 the accuracy would be let's say a
a D
minus but the
direction in this case the direction is
lots of people are excited to come to my
rallies the direction is an
a directionally speaking having 30,000
come to your rally you know packing the
place would be totally
directionally accurate if you said
50,000 or 30,000 doesn't really change
anything except how excited you are
about the president the accuracy would
be a D minus you know if he said 50,000
instead of 30,000 that's a pretty big
difference right which of these
matters which one matters the one that
matters is the direction
the
accuracy never
matters so you've got an entire news
industry talking about the accuracy of
what the President says and the
accuracy almost never
matters the direction matters every time
and it matters a
lot how much do you hate hearing that
cuz that just this just messed up
everything you ever believed about
ethics about the truth about reality
about this President all right I'm going
to I'm going to say it again because I
likeed it so
much except I'm going to write it
bigger so here's the truth has two
parts
[Music]
accuracy and
accuracy and
Direction
accuracy for leadership purposes now I'm
not talking about engineering I'm not
talking about math I'm not talking about
any of the technical fields in the
technical Fields the accuracy would be
really really important okay so there
are plenty of fields in which accuracy
would by by far be the important thing
Medical Science
Etc but when it comes to politics and
Leadership the direction of your
truth is what matters the
accuracy almost never will matter Almost
Never So when you're watching let's say
a let's say a President Carter Jimmy
Carter if Jimmy Carter comes out and
says you know there's a malays in the
country and I don't think things are
going to go that well and it looks like
I'm going to have to raise your taxes
and I don't know what to do about it and
I guess I guess we'll always have
terrorism for example he didn't say
those things but imagine if he had and
let's say that they were all perfectly
accurate what would be the result of all
of that accuracy
Well we'd feel bad we we wouldn't try as
hard it just it just wouldn't feel like
a good
country what if he had said sure things
have been bad but look at all the great
things I'm doing things are turning
around it looks like it looks like the
terrorists are on the run it looks like
Iran is going to cave in any minute it
looks like our military is the best ever
and America is having its best day we're
going to make America great again what
if he had said all those things well
they might not be technically accurate
suppose he said look at all I've done
for the economy but you thought to
yourself well that wasn't you Jimmy that
was sort of the last
president it would still be
better if hypothetical Jimmy
Carter exaggerated because it's just
better leadership now if he exaggerated
in the wrong
direction let's say he said you know
this country is follow apart it's in the
toilet everything's going to blow up in
a in a couple of days that would be
heading in the wrong
direction that would be the worst
problem you could ever make not only are
you inaccurate but you're inaccurate in
the wrong
direction so you can you've got two
directions so as long as you're going in
the right direction with your Truth for
leadership I'll better put
leadership cuz it will be easy for
somebody to take this out of context
this would be a great one for taking out
of context if any of my critics are
watching this is just perfect for taking
out a
context all right
um is it good persuasion for media to
criticize his
accuracy well it hasn't worked yet has
it have you noticed that the number of
inaccuracies the president has doesn't
seem to have a
top have you noticed that if you were to
graph let's say the media's claims about
the president's levels
of
inaccuracy over time you know he started
you know being inaccurate according to
them and it's like ah it's through the
roof all the number of inaccuracies and
times he's past the fact checking it's
through the roof what has it changed
ched what has changed I mean what what
did it
hurt
nothing do you remember I told you from
the very beginning that none of this
would matter and that um I I'm seeing
more and more articles and I think you
have too how many times have you seen um
articles lately saying that the facts
don't matter anymore you've seen that
headline a bunch of times right articles
facts don't matter
we live in a Posta
world this is what people are
discovering this is what I told you in
2015 would be the way um our our public
Consciousness would move we'd move in
the direction of understanding that at
least for
leadership accuracy of your facts don't
really matter and one of the reasons
that the facts don't matter is that we
don't even agree with the facts s
are if we were to you know take the if
the Liberals and the conservatives were
to form groups to let's say majure
anything to
measure um let's say how much of the
economy president Trump was responsible
for or how much of U unemployment was
affected by this President versus the
other would the experts
agree they would not so what what is the
point of
accuracy when nobody agrees what the
accurate situation is anyway I'll bet if
you took the
3500 factchecking failures that the
president has done since the beginning
of his uh his term and you said all
right let me take this list put together
mostly by liberals and handed to the
conservatives now I want you to grade
the people who graded grade the
graders um
and my guess is that you get very
different ideas of the truth so the
accuracy not only doesn't matter but
people don't even agree what is accurate
it's a it's a something you want to be
important but isn't the direction the
direction of the persuasion will always
matter if you're saying something is
more versus saying something is less
that matters all right um I see a lot of
people of telling me I should
watch the bill more show that must have
aired on Friday night something
about uh Shapiro on that show and I will
watch that um I think I'm
scheduled to talk to Ben
Shapiro um my the the soft cover version
of wind bigle will come out uh in the
end of October I think I think the end
of October
and I'll be doing a a little bit more
media then and I'll be uh talking to Ben
Shapiro at some point in the next couple
of
months
um what about Joe Rogan well I'll talk
to him anytime you want it's not up to
