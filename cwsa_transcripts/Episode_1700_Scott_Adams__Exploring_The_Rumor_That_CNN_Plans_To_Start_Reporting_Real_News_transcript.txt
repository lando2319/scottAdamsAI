that's the sound of me not
putting multiple papers
on my desk
yes my printer is still being a problem
but welcome
to the best thing that ever happened to
you
we'll be going to
plan b
oh my goodness
is plan b not working
doesn't seem that it is well we'll make
this work i swear to god
well that's weird
apparently i have at least two technical
problems happening at the same time
i hope your day is better i just have to
do something here now
in order to make the technology work
perfectly
it's going to require the collective
affirmations of all of you and i'd like
you to join me now in something called
the simultaneous sip
because if i can
capture all of the goodwill and
vibrations from all of you
it might be enough to make my printer
work and we're going to test this out
live all right
um
i'm going to cue up my printer and then
i'm going to see if the simultaneous sip
makes it work
for the first time are you ready for
this experiment
we're going to have to i'll tell you
what i'll do since the printer will take
a moment to tell me whether it's working
or not
this could be exciting
we'll do the simultaneous sip
simultaneously all right
now before we know the answer all you
need is a couple of marker glasses to
tank your chelsea stein canteen sugar
floss a vessel of any kind fill me with
your favorite liquid i like coffee join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure the
i don't think it's working
it's not working but let's have the
simultaneous sip anyway
that's all we need
go
now
one of the questions you might ask
yourself is scott
how do you
handle the risk of embarrassing yourself
in a live setting
to thousands of people
and the answer is i don't really care
i i've noticed
uh over the years
that when i have a really good plan
and i'm really like i'm on point and i
think i'm nailing it
sometimes people like it sometimes they
don't
and that i've also noticed that if i'm
completely unprepared and everything
goes wrong
sometimes it's great
sometimes it's not it's completely
non-productive
i'll tell you when i first learned that
i first learned that
i did i did reboot it i rebooted it just
before i went live
the first time i learned that
preparation doesn't seem to matter as
much as you think is when i started
cartooning and i only had an hour to
make a cartoon before i went to my day
job and if i didn't do one in that hour
i'd fall behind deadline
and i found that sometimes i'd come in
there and i'd have an idea and i'd have
the full hour to develop it and it'd be
pretty good
sometimes not
and other times
55 minutes would go by and i'd have
nothing
but i had a rule that i always had to do
something the same rule the beatles had
by the way the beatles had the same rule
if they started a song they had to
finish it
they couldn't wait till the next day
they had to finish anything they started
so i had a
analogous rule which is that i would
have to do a comic within an hour
no matter
how many minutes were left when i
decided i had to charge through and
finish it
and i found that the
the
five-minute
comics were exactly as popular as the
one-hour comics there was
there was a total difference in the
audience
and that ladies and gentlemen
is a lesson
you don't really know what's going to
work well sometimes just winging it if
you know what you're doing
works too
i
however have
three backups
i have my printed copy that's not
working
i have my
phone as my backup for the digital copy
which apparently did not sync with my
notes from my other system
a second technical problem
but am i am i dissuaded by that no
because unlike you i have a third backup
which is already fired up right over
here
so
if you have enough devices and enough
coffee
you can make anything work it's true
story number one
employment looks good weirdly
so um
the new pandemic you're a low of 3.6
percent uh unemployment
that's actually great isn't it
so
here's the interesting thing
so this is in the the realm of
predictions
i've said to you before
that there's one uh economic measure
that if that one is working you can kind
of figure that everything else will work
out too maybe a little slower but if you
can get one thing right
it's the most important thing to get
right and that's employment
because the difference between having a
job and not having a job is a gigantic
difference
it's it's adding to the system versus
subtracting from the system
so every job is sort of a big increment
in goodness
so at the moment we have
actually a really good employment
situation
but
here's the test to the prediction
so remember the the rule is
sort of scott's rule i guess
i didn't invent it but
we'll say it's mine for now that if you
get employment right
you know you don't have a lot of
unemployment everything else will work
out
now is that true if you've got pandemics
and inflation and
you know ukraine
stirring things up and supply chain
problems
well that's the test right this is sort
of the ultimate test of that
predictive variable
and i'm going to stick with it
so i'm going to stick with
employment being the most predictive
thing
if the employment numbers had been bad i
would be panicking a little bit
going to be honest
going to be honest if the employment
numbers were going down
as fast as inflation was going up
i'd be spinning in this chair right now
but when i see inflation going up i hate
it i mean everybody's taking a bad
haircut right now and you know
you can't all afford it
so
that's bad that's really bad but it's
not as bad as unemployment would be i
mean not even close i don't think so
let's uh track that and see if that
still
comes true so some more fake news or is
it
there are reportedly seven hours
of call logs missing from the white
house
call logs
said call logs too many times because it
was january 6 and and trump
was doing who knows what because those
missing records but turns out there were
no missing records in the sense of
deleted
so nobody deleted anything
the the records are
an exact record of what they should be
recording it's just that they don't
record every phone
that's pretty much the whole story
so the story went from yesterday
uh it's like a watergate situation with
you know missing missing call logs
at the most suspicious time
and then it morphed into oh it looks
like you used some other phone
okay
now if you are the president
or any
any ceo or any leader trying to let's
say make sure there's not a digital path
to you
wouldn't you just borrow somebody else's
phone
yeah i realize you so trump was asked if
he used a burner phone
a kind of phone that um is not
associated with a person it's just sort
of a short-term phone you use
criminals use it drug dealers use burner
phones
uh cheaters use burner phones that sort
of thing
so
he he was asked that trump said he he
didn't recognize the term or he didn't
know what a burner phone was
and then john bolton threw him under the
bus and said he talked about burner
phones with me
so
um
is there a story here
yeah
like this this feels like a whole bunch
of nothing
doesn't it
suppose we know that trump used some
other means of communication
either directly or indirectly
you know here's how i imagine it going
the way i imagine it going
is trump standing next to somebody who
has their own phone
and saying can you call so and so and
say this or that
i mean that's sort of the way i imagined
it like i don't imagine that there are
necessarily
direct phone calls from trump to
somebody that would be
you know
implement incriminating in any way
but who knows you know one of the one of
the things that
trump has done so well for years is
avoid digital records
he doesn't use email for example
and
that's that's gotta work in your favor
as some level of business
you probably shouldn't write anything
down
at some point you should only whisper to
people you know in a secure location
that's it nothing else
the way putin probably does it
all right so here's my favorite story
from this is uh on fox
fox website
uh so of course one of my favorite
things about the news
is watching the fox news cnn you know
battle with each other and and how they
frame the other the other side because
it's it's the one
it's the one situation where you can be
fairly confident
that they're not really hiding their
bias
which doesn't mean they're always lying
i'm just saying that you know they don't
do it to inform you they do it
for competitive reasons
and uh so this is hilarious according to
fox news
uh it's talking about how uh zucker
uh the disgraced
[Laughter]
they call him the disgraced ex-ceo
so i think it's funny whenever anybody
calls anybody else disgraced
as if there's anybody famous anymore
who's not disgraced
everybody's disgraced to somebody so
does it really mean anything to call
somebody disgraced i mean i get it i
know why they're they're saying it and
and i i would agree with the description
but you sort of a little bit overused i
feel like everybody's a little bit
disgraced for one reason or another i'm
sure i've disgraced myself a few times
i'm pretty sure i'll disgrace myself
again before the end of the day
anyway i love that word in politics
and uh
so here's how fox
writes it in an attempt to restore cnn's
credibility so that
this is making you think past the sale
so you're supposed to uh just sort of
agree that it's an obvious fact that cnn
has no credibility so according to fox
news in an attempt to restore cnn's
credibility
they talk about the new leader licht or
light i don't know how to pronounce it
is expected to attempt to pivot back to
straight news after zucker allowed the
network to take on a partisan liberal
approach that has struggled to attract
viewers during the biden era
i love how they say it now
who exactly is expecting this
so fox news is writing it like you know
these are facts
you know if you didn't if you didn't
stop and slow down to read the actual
words
you'd sort of accept it as this is
common knowledge
that they're a disgraced network
they need to restore their credibility
and the new guy is at least thinking
about he hasn't decided
he hasn't made the decision yet but he's
definitely
definitely maybe thinking about
reporting real news
so that's that's that fox news frames
oh that was funny
[Laughter]
um
do you remember as i do
think back
you know maybe a year or two
do you remember what it was popular to
say
that uh uh
anybody would be better than trump
you know anybody would be a better
president than trump and one of the
reasons that people would defend biden
you know i'd say you know biden's too
old what about you know forget about his
policies
can we really have a president that old
isn't that unsafe
and people would say i swear to god
they'd say
anything's better than trump
but i'll bet they didn't think they'd
get to test that hypothesis did they
turns out
turns out we're testing the hypothesis
we're literally finding out if anything
is is is absolutely anything better than
trump
so
you know normally you would think that
you would say that as sort of a
framing question
you don't think that you get to actually
scientifically test it
so we found the the firs the furthest
thing from something that you could get
here's something
here's biden
let's see let's see if anything is
better than trump
so far
so far i think trump is beating the
furthest thing from something
but maybe maybe i'm being subjective
about that maybe
um
so i've seen a few people speculate and
i was having the same feeling joel
pollock said this
and i'm seeing some other writers pick
up on it
that it seems like the mainstream media
is trying to get ahead of the hunter
biden laptop story
that they had been suppressing and
behind
until now
it seemed like somewhat of a sudden
shift
as if
as if they've been informed as
something's coming
meaning that they need to get ahead of
it because it'd be a little too
embarrassing to have never mentioned it
if for example and this is hypothetical
if there's an indictment coming down
it's starting to look like uh
foreshadowing doesn't it
if this were a movie script
and you and you saw the uh let's say the
protagonist of the movie if you saw them
flipping through the channels and all
the news anchors started talking about
this story for the first time and you
knew you knew that that was unusual
wouldn't you see it as foreshadowing
definitely it looks exactly like it now
i don't think it's the same reason i
think it's maybe just
that they're softening up the public for
what's coming maybe
the other possibility is that the
decision has come down
to get rid of biden so that he's not a
risk for running
because what if
what if
joe biden said he wants i mean he said
it publicly but what if he really said
he's going to run again
what would the
democrat leadership do
if biden
who is the president after all
what if he said he wants to run again
he could make it happen could he not
i think he'd get the he'd get the
nomination
i don't know
i don't know that the democrats could
allow that to happen so it looks like
the hit has been put on biden himself by
the democrats
am i wrong
i i feel like they put the hit on them
they have to take them out so they have
a chance of you know developing somebody
who could be more of a longer-term
leader
under the mold of whoever is molding
whoever
somebody's molding somebody over there
i'm sure of it
yeah
the 25th is knocking you say all right
here's a question that i've been
wondering you you know we keep hearing
about the 50 former and current
intel officials who signed the letter
saying that the hunter laptop thing was
russian disinformation
when they must have known
that it wasn't
or they must have known that they
couldn't know
whether it was or it wasn't
now
how do you get 50 people
professionals
to tell a horrendous lie in public and
then sign it
what exactly were they getting in return
or
or is it worse
did somebody like john brennan i'll just
pick him as a random name
did somebody just ask them to do it and
then they just did
is
are were all of those officials so
afraid of whoever asked them to do it
that they knew that doing it
was good for their careers
and not doing it was bad for their
careers
in other words were they blackmailed
because that's what that is right
now do you have to say the words or are
they all in the business where they know
how things work
remember schumer said they've got a you
know thousand what
100 ways from sunday or something to get
back at you
so do you think that
people in the intelligence world
need to explicitly threaten anything
they don't need to explicitly threaten
anything because they're all on the same
page
so somebody such as i'll just pick a
name at random john brennan
if somebody at that stature
were to ask them to do something that
they didn't want to do and didn't feel
completely comfortable with
would they feel that they had to do it
anyway
and
isn't that blackmail
if you don't explicitly say i will get
back at you
is that necessary
does the crime of blackmail
require an explicit threat actually i
don't know the answer that all right
there must be
there's probably a hundred lawyers
watching this right now if somebody's an
attorney
do you need
the threats or the blackmail threats
spelled out
or can it be so clear to anybody who
would understand the situation that
it still counts as a crime
because you've set up a situation where
it's very clear
that black male is in play even if you
don't say it
that'd be hard to prove wouldn't
oh that would be extortion somebody says
i don't know about that
why pay blackmail if there's no threat
because there's an implied uh cause and
effect
so it doesn't have to be a threat you
could just understand that under this
situation this bad thing will happen to
you you just have to know what could
happen that's all
all right
give me an answer to that
so looks like russia is propping up the
ruble but here are a couple things that
i learned
one of one of the reasons that the gas
is still flowing from russia and russia
hasn't tried to use that as a weapon
is that they don't have pipelines to
sell it anywhere else
so just as europe is trapped
by having to buy
russian energy
and russia is trapped for the time being
and accepting dollars and euros they
want to accept rubles but they can't
because they're mostly operating on
long-term contracts that were signed a
while ago and here's the funniest part
apparently russia has decided to honor
the deals
during war
i mean it's literally you know economic
war on top of military war
and the very people that putin's at war
with
their their energy companies are saying
oh yeah we're going to honor the deal
you know we're not going to just change
the deal and say you have to pay rubles
no no there's a deal
and i'm thinking really
is that the way it works
do they follow the contract
in this situation
i don't know
but i guess one of the reasons they
would follow the contract is that
there's no reason to break it
and the no reason to break it
is that they don't have options
meaning they can't sell it anywhere else
there's no other pipelines they can't
sell to china because they don't have
the infrastructure to deliver it and it
wouldn't be easy to fix it it would take
a long time
so
so russia is trapped and europe is
trapped so russia probably wants to use
it as a weapon but can't
because they don't have alternatives and
europe would like to use it as a weapon
by not buying it
but they can't because they don't have
alternatives
and then biden's going to release this
gas from the
uh
the reserves the emergency reserves
that every expert everyone says will
make no difference at all
am i wrong
literally every expert says this will
make no difference at all oh it might
make a difference if there's an
emergency
if there's an emergency you're going to
miss it because he might use a third of
it or some big number and then we'll
have to fill it back up at a higher
price i mean it doesn't look like
anything
it doesn't look like anything that
biden's doing is right
does it
you know i'm sure i'm a little biased
there
did you now all right we'll check your
fake news because the fake news is not
all on the other side
let me say it again
you and i
may have been victims of fake news too
not just other people not just other
people
and here's one that maybe we didn't all
know you know we keep talking about this
keystone
pipeline
did you know that there are two keystone
pipelines at least two
one is completely done and working fine
so nothing happened with that one
recently but the keystone xl
is the one that was going to be built
but hasn't it's not close to per yeah it
wasn't even close to being done
so therefore not
when biden closed it down it shouldn't
have made really any difference that we
should see now
it could have made a difference in the
long run globally
a lot of it wasn't even going to be
domestic
so there was you know basically
um that story may be overblown
so for those of you saying hey look what
biden did you know if you'd kept that
pipeline project going you know or gas
prices would be less or whatever
but probably not
probably not
however
uh energy prices don't move on actual
supply and demand as much as the
expectation
of supply and demand which i hasten to
say because i know i'm being watched by
real economists
the expectation of supply
and the actual supply are kind of a
blended concept in economics
you get that
so it's it's a finer point
uh yeah i'm not sure it's useful for the
general public but the the actual supply
and the expected supply don't really
have much of a difference
when you're pricing stuff
okay you're welcome
see i can adjust i can adjust so that
adjustment is based on specific feedback
that i thought was
useful
and
so when biden does things like
any kind of energy project in public
what should be your first
thought hey
people might expect
less energy in the future
so it changes expectations changing
expectations has an effect on
effectively what we call the supply
and so
collectively the things that
biden did are signaling a lack of supply
in the future
so it's not an actual supply chain it's
a
an expected supply chain and that could
change the the price
so where trump did everything right
psychologically
biden is doing everything wrong
psychologically if you believe that
wrong
means producing less energy domestically
all right
um
i have a theory that all wars are going
to be drone wars from now on meaning
that
um
the thing that will matter
is how well your drones are performing
and how many you have
and that that will be the dominant
weapon because it has to be right it
kind of has to be you have to think
there's a limit to
manned
aircraft
right there has to be a limit to how
many human aircraft there can be because
as the number of unmanned aircraft goes
up they're all they're all vulnerable
and
there
there's no way that ground to base to
anything
is going to compete with drones if you
have enough of them
so you know of course there are ways to
jam drones and blah blah blah blah
but ultimately
there's going to be a
somebody's going to take out the jammer
and then the drones take over blah blah
blah so to me it seems that drones are
going to be the thing that predict who
wins which also means economy in some
ways or who who's supporting you with
their own economy
and
here's my take on ukraine
going to the white board
as some number of drones
some number
whatever that number is
ukraine wins
meaning that
let's see if i can get you a better
picture here
meaning that
the only thing that is going to predict
what happens with ukraine next is how
many drones
have been delivered and how many of them
can be you know
actually used
and we don't know that number do we
why is it that we don't know that number
isn't that the single most important
thing
because if they have enough drones of
the right kind yeah and i'm talking
about the small suicide drones i'm not
talking about the i'm not talking about
the big ones the turkish ones that are
very expensive i'm talking about the
small ones
if they have enough of them
um
they win right they win in the sense
that at the very least
russia can't um
can't conquer them now there's news that
there was a russian uh let's see
i think it was a fuel depot
attack within russia
you know so over the border from ukraine
and that the ukrainians did a helicopter
attack
in the homeland of russia
now
there's a lot in that story
number one
number one
um
if they're going after fuel
that's more indication that it's a war
of uh starving the army right denying
them food and ammunition and fuel
now do you think you can do that with
drones and helicopters if you get the
big stuff
so i isn't there sort of a an 80 20 rule
at play here
that you don't have to eliminate all the
fuel
you have to eliminate some percentage of
it right
you don't have to eliminate all the food
just there's some percentage you have to
eliminate they would just stop the army
wouldn't it
because it would just distract them they
just have to eat
so
how many drones would it take
to keep an army from retreating
because
here's what i'm most um curious about
does zelinski seem like the kind of guy
who would take a draw
you know would he go into a battle and
say i'll take a tie
is there anything we've seen in his
personality his career the way he
presents himself is there anything about
him that says i think i'll play for a
draw
i don't think so
so i'm at least open to the possibility
that he's after putin and the way he's
going to do it is by destroying the
russian military
in ukraine
and i think he can actually do it
and all it takes is some number of
drones because so here's the argument
the argument is this
if ukraine can take out big fuel depots
and obviously they can
because i would think a fuel depot is
the most
vulnerable thing there could be
what could be more vulnerable
to drone attacks and helicopter attacks
than
a fuel duplo a fuel depot seems like it
would be the ultimate target
so if you take out the big ones
can russia adjust enough with you know
workarounds and small ones
i mean
they may be you know
three fuel depots away from stalling the
entire army in ukraine
making it impossible to get out
and what happens when they can't leave
and they can't eat
i think i think ukraine just starts
starving them and picking them off
there there may be a play here
that zelensky is actually going to
try to take over russia
and actually just run the whole thing
because
i know it's crazy it's crazy but think
about this
if zelinski could destroy the russian
military
don't you think putin's gone
how would he survive that
if he actually destroyed it
and i think he actually could
now destroy it doesn't mean literally
again it means trapping it in the
country and just keeping it there it's
it's done
if it can't get out it's as good as dead
it wouldn't have any purpose
so yeah so
let me let me allow the following
i'm i'm probably not the military expert
you need to be listening to
can we agree on that
can we agree
that for military uh
military predictions
i'm not really the one you should be
listening to
all right
we can all be on the same page in that
now you understand that i i've confessed
this before
that
i speak with more confidence
than maybe you know my internal process
is matched to because part of it is
presentation
so don't confuse the presentation which
i do confidently
with my opinion of what's actually going
to happen which is more of a statistical
thing
statistically speaking i'd give this
five to ten percent
but that's bigger than you would right
i think you'd give it zero percent
and i'm saying there's something
happening here that makes me think this
all right let me let me defend the ten
percent number one how hard is it
with your opinions how hard would it be
to trap them in country to trap the
military now that they're already
degraded
and we know exactly the limited ways
they can get out right if the roads are
taken out or mined
or the ukrainians have enough drones to
stop whoever's in the front of anything
i and they can take up the energy i
think they can stall them
now somebody says the threat's a threat
of nukes well i wonder about the
strategy of not making the guy who's
trying to kill you angry
i mean i get it i get it that if putin's
pushed into a corner he might use
tactical nukes
but i don't think so
because i think using tactical nukes
would end him for sure wouldn't it
or it would reduce his chances
of survival and we don't actually think
he's crazy do we i mean he'd have to be
literally crazy to do that i think and i
don't think we think he's literally
crazy that was more propaganda
speaking of propaganda
this is really interesting a little out
of uh
context here but uh stefan collinson who
usually writes about trump and how bad
trump is and i always think of him as
cnn's uh paid propagandist
because he's an opinion
an opinion writer so it's it's fair to
do what he does right it's just opinion
and it's you know it's presented that
way so so i think that's fair as long as
he's presenting it as opinion and he
does
but he's changed um
here's well let me just tell you what he
said today has nothing to do with trump
but just keep in mind
that on cnn in my opinion so this is
just my opinion he's sort of their go-to
propaganda guy you know go write some
bad stories about trump sort of thing
but now he's saying that western
intelligence agencies are waging a
psychological war over ukraine
he says directly with russian president
putin an expert at the genre who is now
effectively taking a dose of his own
medicine
sorry so stefan coulson is talking about
how
the western intel people are using as
much misinformation
to get at putin
as putin is using misinformation to get
at us so they're playing the same game
and he says the united states and its
allies are painting a picture of a
bogged down demoralized and
dysfunctional russian military taking
disastrous losses on the battlefield and
are simultaneously conjuring a vision of
growing political tension inside the
kremlin
they claim the russian leader is
isolated poorly advised and lacking real
intelligence on just how badly the war
is going
now
correct me if i'm wrong
but did not
stephen collinson just say and i don't
think i'm over interpreting this
am i
did he not just say that the message
that is known to be he's characterizing
it as disinformation
matches exactly
cnn's um reporting
on the war
so is he not basically saying the cnn is
part of
the disinformation campaign
because what cnn is reporting is exactly
what the
intel people are telling them which is
hey
we've got this secret insider
information that putin's not getting
good information inside as if we know
that
as if we know that
right
and it's kind of
weird meta
self-referential thing that's confusing
me
so the cnn guy whose job it is again in
my opinion
is to write opinion pieces that are
completely biased
is writing
an opinion piece
in the context
of fox news saying that cnn may be
trying to report straight news
and collinson is reporting something
that looks to me like straight news
and the straight news is
that all the news people have been lying
to you
because intelligence people have been
feeding them bs
which surely they knew
surely
surely the media companies knew
that they were getting propaganda
surely the media companies know that
when somebody says hey
we've got some information from
uh putin's uh bathroom
like he was scribbling a note while he
was on the toilet and we saw the note
and it says that he's not getting good
information from his generals no we
didn't
no we didn't
we
the people who are in the media
professionally who have done this for
years
they know that when you hear in the
context of war when you hear that
there's trouble inside putin's inner
circle
they know that's not real
but did they report it to you as though
it were not real
did they report it to you as something
that is obvious propaganda
it could be real
but that you should judge it as probable
propaganda
i don't believe they did
if i'm wrong please correct me
but i believe the media reported these
as if
it was a report that you should take
with some
you know not a grain of salt necessarily
right
so
is it true
what fox news is saying that cnn is
going to start
being straight with the news and
actually tell you
what's really happening
i don't know
here's a question that i wonder about
why have there been no ukrainian drone
attacks in moscow
now when i say in moscow i mean not
against civilian targets
but there must be you know government
buildings that you could
explode with a small suicide drone
now you might say to yourself scott
scott scott it's not easy
to get a ukrainian and a drone into
russia
to which i say can you really tell the
difference between a ukrainian and a
russian
[Laughter]
there are no ukrainians to speak russian
really well
i'm pretty sure there are pretty sure
there are
and you can't get a drone that would fit
and that literally would fit in the
suitcase
literally you fit in the suitcase
you can't get one of those
and one ukrainian
within two kilometers of moscow
to take out i don't know their politburo
or something or at least put a bomb
there
because all it would do really it
wouldn't you know ideally would kill no
civilians who would just
make news
don't you think that the citizens of
russia would start asking questions
if government buildings start blowing up
in moscow
and i'm trying to think
why isn't that happening i'm not
recommending it
so again
sometimes my my tone gives you a
misleading sense of my opinion my
opinion is
i don't know
again i'm not a military expert
but it seems to me
yeah if the only risk is the risk of
nukes i don't think that would do it
do you
do you think
blowing up a few government buildings in
moscow
would cause putin to nuke anything
i don't think so
i don't think so at all
now again
we also don't know right
so
do you want to take the risk
maybe not
maybe not
but if they're
if zelensky is willing to do a
helicopter attack
in russian territory which he just did
actually the second time if they're
willing to do that
are they somebody says false flag i
don't know if you take out
a depot that big as a that would be the
worst false flag
if you're going to pick a false flag
that would be the worst one you could
pick
all right
here's some interesting things
uh or are there
um
the the hunter uh laptop story is funny
jack passovic uh has tweeted a number of
times
that uh i don't know it's been
some
long number of months
since he offered the full copy of hunter
hunter's uh laptop you know a copy of
the drive
to the media including jake tapper as
cnn and nobody's ever nobody's ever
taken him up on it
what's that tell you
now
though you think they at least want to
look at it
even to report that is fake
don't not don't even care
don't don't even want to get a copy
i don't know
now um
i i also saw a glenn greenwald article
about matt gates
and how long has it been since the matt
gates allegations
it's been a while right
a year over a year right
so it's been over a year
and the only part of the story that's
been verified
is the part of the story that matt gates
sent
which is that they were being
blackmailed that's now verified fact
there have been no charges
against matt gates it's been a year
so
[Music]
what do you make of that
um
yeah he got canceled hard
you know you watch one person after
another get taken out
and
you wonder who's next right if you look
at the landscape of all the people who
were sort of
making a lot of noise for trump in 2016
most of them seem to have been taken out
by now now a lot of them made it easy
sometimes they make it easy
but
wow yeah jim jordan there's a hit piece
on him as well i mean i don't know i
don't know what things are true and what
or not so
i neither i neither condem nor
defend anybody who's been accused of
things i have no idea what they did or
didn't do
i'm just noting that they all have hit
pieces and they were
prominent supporters of trump
um
now
apparently
i don't know if you knew this but uh the
ukraine
i don't know if the ukrainians are part
of this or just the uh the allies
trying to come up to some way some way
to make a
non-nato deal
uh for ukraine so there'd be some kind
of security guarantee
but it would not involve nato
and i was trying to come up what would
be the perfect name
for a
let's say a security guarantee situation
in which russia had already vetoed
nato as being that entity so it'd have
to be something that's no no it's not
nato no
no
it's not nato it's something like it
so i would call it
nieto
nieto
not nato
it's the one that was uh
hey
that's not bad
nieto
i'll leave you a moment to
save savor and relish that pun
and you're welcome you're welcome
oh lord
all right
is there anything else that i have not
covered is there any story and please
don't ask me about disney
i don't know if there's anything i've
cared less about than the whole disney
blah blah blah blah
i don't care
i don't know why
now
i was a little surprised that uh you
were all here on time
um
it's a little surprising
because once congress rolled back that
whole daylight savings time thing
yesterday
you know once they moved the clocks back
last night i thought today i'm going to
wake up
and like half of you aren't even going
to show up at the right time
but apparently
many of you
are on top of it and you adjusted your
clocks last night so that you would be
on time for this and for for work
what
oh oh it's april fool's april fools
somebody says my spirit animal is a
tortoise
i don't quite know how to take that
but i'd like to put this horrible
thought in your mind
everybody reminds you of an animal
you just haven't figured out which one
yet
and once you see it
you can't unsee it
i uh i once described somebody as a
uh a monkey in a human costume
and uh
and by the way it was a caucasian human
i was mocking just
just so you don't think there's a racial
element to it because it wasn't
and uh once you hear it it's all you can
see
it's all it's all you can see after
after you get that in your head
um
corona dropped off the map
didn't it yes it did
all right so uh let's let's do a uh
a vote here
now remember reality can never be
settled apparently even science can't
settle reality for us
so
we've gone through the entire pandemic
and now we're sort of at the other end
of it i think
was alex berenson
mostly right or mostly wrong
go
alex berenson now remember he was banned
by social media for
a lot of uh contrarian opinions
in the comments was he mostly right or
mostly wrong
i'm saying
mostly
rights mostly
mostly right
mostly rights
and what would be some examples of what
you think he was mostly right about
what would be an example of something he
was mostly right about lockdown's not
working
we all thought that
masks don't work
natural immunity is good
mass weren't effective during omicron
vaccination leak
lab leak
interesting
all right
who do you think was the most accurate
um
predictor
let's say predictor
during the pandemic
who is the most accurate predictor
on the on the locals uh network there's
only two answers people are saying
themselves and sometimes me
uh
joe rogan alex jones the youtube answers
are completely different
trump tim poole
uh
i only only one person on youtube says
me
that's the difference between the
subscription network and the open
network
yeah well you know here's the thing
we're gonna have to we're gonna have to
make do with the fact that it cannot be
settled
is that that is so unsatisfying to me
it's terribly unsatisfying
that it can't be settled
uh i would i would say that my record is
the best by far
because i'm pretty sure everything that
alex berenson got right i got right
i'm pretty sure
i can't i can't think of
oh we disagreed on masks but not we
didn't disagree on mandates
so i agreed that if they worked they
didn't work well enough i mean once
once we got past the first you know
initial phase
so i think he was wrong about the
science of masks but right that they
didn't make enough difference in the
real world the way people actually acted
yes on locals people actually pay for my
opinion as is being said on locals right
now
and so they're more likely to
think that they're paying for something
that has value
so cognitive dissonance would cause
people on a subscription network
to believe that you were more right than
you actually are
right that bias should be something
you're actually feeling if you're paying
for it
uh oh number of deaths
yeah
so a number of people say that i make
every kind of prediction and then i can
uh
and then i can confirm it right so how
many would agree with that
characterization of me
that i'm someone who makes all kinds of
predictions i guess maybe on both sides
of issues so then i can then i can claim
i'm right
what would be an example of that
i'm seeing enough yeses that i'm taking
it seriously but what would be there
there are lots of yeses but less than
those
what would be an example of that
there probably isn't i have to
ukraine
well by ukraine i took the i took the l
on ukraine that doesn't count if if i
explicitly take the l
then you can't say
how do you how do you criticize that
if i make a clear prediction then say i
was very wrong
i mean
don't don't you know
take yes for an answer
vp vice president
yeah you know
i think it's fun to talk about having a
prediction that's wrong but that the
reason you made it was still the right
reason it just didn't work out i mean i
think that's fair
that's not really flip-flopping
all right
um
oh that one
yeah
the the the the skirt one
that's that's a longer conversation but
that's probably the best one that's
probably the best example i'll give you
that one
all right
uh and now
ladies and gentlemen
i was lambasting berenson well i still
disagree with him on all the things that
i disagreed when i landed
will you say atlanta
i don't think that's true now i have
said
from fairly early on i think you can
confirm
that i said that the alex berensons are
valuable
and that you need them
like they could be right and they could
be wrong but you need you need those
rogue doctors the mcculloughs and all
that so i don't know if they're right or
wrong
i'm not qualified pretty sure you're not
either
but
um
you definitely need the pushback that's
like that's a creative tension
oh does uh i'm being asked if michael
shellenberger has a chance
uh to win as an independent
in california
and the answer is
nobody else would
so
so let me let me be
let me give you the the best answer i
can give you
could michael schellenberger win
what looks like you know against all
odds win of being an independent and win
in california
and the answer is nobody else could
nobody else could
so if you're saying to me scott you know
nobody could do that i'll agree 999
with you nobody else could
but nobody else could have moved the
needle on nuclear energy either
hear what i'm saying
he's already done things that didn't
look possible
so if somebody does things that don't
look possible
yeah when do you bet against them
all right
and remember california is pretty
thirsty for solutions
and you've never seen a more specific
solution oriented
candidate i'm pretty sure
somebody can correct me on that but for
a major office say governor
has there ever been somebody as a
prescriptive who somebody who's
literally written books
describing the solution
multiple books and describing solutions
specific to san francisco in in the
latest book san francisco
so we've never really seen this
now my understanding is that the way the
california elections work
uh is that
there are so many people registered as
independent that if you actually got a
good bite
of the independence you would make it
into some kind of a runoff
so because of the way our system works
because of the dire hole that we're in
because there's never been a candidate
who has a bonafide left leaning history
but settled on solutions that are sort
of you know just the ones that work
so you could you could say he's the
first democrat who understood how
anything works
but you don't get elected that way
but that's sort of what i think he is
like i've always said the ultimate
candidate would be somebody who embraced
democrat ideals
but republican techniques like systems
because the thing the democrats always
get wrong is the human motivation
but on top of that sometimes they get
the science wrong too
and he fixes both of those things
so
the the schellenberger approach to
basically everything
is
what do we know already works
what do we know doesn't work
let's do more of the things that work
that's it
and who's on the other side of that
exactly
right like what what's the counter
argument to doing things that
we can pretty well confirm work and
avoiding the things we can pretty be
sure of don't work
i know now
the thing he does that maybe
will limit him
is while he has a you know a serious
history of caring about
you know the planet you know very
left-leaning ideals that's how he
started you know an activist in that
in that area
and he's definitely very concerned about
the homeless and the you know the
disadvantage because again that's
another huge focus of his work
so who has been that focused on the
on the problems and the the victims
who's been that focused on them
at the same time has had practical
solutions
exactly nobody
so here's the problem with predicting
if you predict from the past
you always miss a schellenberger
if you predict from the past you always
miss a trump
because the past never produced a trump
if you always judge from the past you
couldn't have a joe rogan
because nobody ever
just started their own show with a
camera and a microphone and
and suddenly they were the biggest media
platform in the world
or the country i guess
so you miss you miss all of the
interesting stuff if you use the past to
predict the future it just doesn't
and the whole history per you know
history repeats
is a really limited mindset
you don't want to get trapped in that
yeah it doesn't repeat but it rhymes
exactly
yeah rush limbaugh was another person
you couldn't predict that who would have
predicted the rise of rush limbaugh
you wouldn't
um
all right
and that by the way is all i have to say
for today i think this was by far
uh the highlight of your
experience today
and i hope it gets better because that
would be amazing i mean imagine starting
from this plateau and even getting
better
come on come on
and yes i went an entire day without
talking about
the slap
and i think that is a sign of the golden
age
youtube i'll talk to you
tomorrow
