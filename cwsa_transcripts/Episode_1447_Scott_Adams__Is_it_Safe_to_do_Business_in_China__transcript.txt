hello everybody today's topic is
is it safe to do business in china
if you're an american company let's say
for example
now i would say that in the past if you
looked at the risk and reward of doing
business in china he had a certain
amount of risks
but the reward was so high because the
cost advantage would be great you could
get things done quickly perhaps
and so in in the past it was
safe enough to do business in china that
massive amounts of business went there
but what's changed a lot first of all
reputationally
if you do business in china now you're
doing business with an entity
that literally is running i guess you'd
call them
uh imprisonment uh slave labor camps
for the uyghurs i'm not sure what the
the right word is but
you don't want your company associated
with that
imagine if you'd been doing business
with you know nazi germany
and then suddenly the you know the world
decides that uh that's a bad idea you
don't want to be caught in that
situation
likewise we have the allegations that
china is using
a political prisoners the flu falun gong
group for example as as
the sources of forced organ transplants
so they're they're donors do you want to
be associated with that reputationally
it's kind of risky it's a big risk i
would say
what about china's fentanyl trade
they're sending
fentanyl to the cartels in mexico
and then the cartels are putting it into
pills in the united states and tens of
thousands of americans are dying every
year
do you want your company associated with
prison camps
forced organ donations and
drug overdose deaths because that's
china's brand at this point
and if you do business with them you're
taking out a little bit of that
reputational risk
um what about the ransomware attacks
what about the ip
theft what about a number of things that
they've been doing
there's reports of bogus arrests
if you want to do business in china
could you guarantee that you wouldn't be
arrested
on trumped-up charges
take me for example do you think i could
go to china and they wouldn't be
watching me and looking for a reason to
maybe pick me up
china is a pretty dangerous place at the
moment because they're not they're not
answerable to anybody
and they're looking out for their own
best interests
one of the big risks of doing business
in china
is that your cost advantage might be an
illusion
because a robot that's let's say a robot
is designed in america
to manufacture something that robot's
going to cost
china the same thing as it costs an
american company
because they're buying the same robot
from the same place
but if the robot makes something in
america you don't have these shipping
fees for american customers
if you make if the same robot works in
china
well then um you know they've got a
shipping fee on top of the robot expense
so in theory robotics should make their
business
go away and the entire stability of
china
is going to be at risk if robots start
taking that those kinds of jobs
so that could happen and it could happen
fairly quickly
so you don't want to be embedded in a
country where they the entire country
has some
instability um you want to make out
make sure that uh you're in a country
that has fair trade deals
and they're not going to change them
after the fact i don't know if you could
trust china there
i don't know that you could trust
china's courts if you get into any kind
of a legal
battle in china how's that going to go
well i think that they're going to
prefer chinese companies
and so i would say that that's a pretty
big risk
there's also a big demographic risk in
china there's a climate change problem
there's a
pollution problem there's some military
provocation
going on and
let's not leave out karma
i don't know if karma is real i'm not a
new age
kind of person but china is involved in
some really really bad stuff
and if that doesn't come around and bite
them in the ass
i'd be surprised because it looks like
everything is
is sort of going in that direction right
now
and then also there's a problem that
china is
banning the internet or at least free
use of the internet to its own
population
what happens to the chinese government
and its stability
if if people can't breathe and it's
flooded and they can't get jobs
and and there's a demographic time bomb
and all of it gets blamed on leadership
in my opinion
the leadership of china is more
vulnerable
than maybe we realize i think that they
could be a lot closer to having to make
a big change
because their reputation could not be
worse i mean they're
they have a reputation that's on par
with nazi germany
and that's that's real that's actually
the way people are starting to see them
so if you're an american company and
you've not made the decision to do
business with china
consider that it's no longer just the
cost and benefit of how much
it costs to do business here versus
somewhere else
it's now you taking on a reputational
risk
and probably somewhere in the
neighborhood of 30 to 50 percent of
americans
would definitely make the decision to
buy american even if it costs a little
bit more if they have the option
so imagine american companies simply
targeting the
the chinese manufacturing companies that
are the most vulnerable
reproducing them in america americans
say hey thank you very much
i like your robotic made stuff and i
like your 3d printers
and we can do that here so
bottom line nobody ever got fired for
buying ibm equipment used to be an old
saying
back when ibm was so dominant that if
you bought their hardware and it didn't
work
well they'd fix it and it wouldn't be
your problem so they would make it work
every time
so you never got fired for buying for
buying ibm for your company
because that ibm made it work but
could you get fired for making a
decision to bring
some part of your manufacturing or doing
business with china
when all of these risks are known these
are known
reputational risks and and financial
risks and legal risks and everything
else
and if you know that there are risks and
you do it anyway
you're putting your own job in jeopardy
so i think things
might start changing pretty quickly
because in the united states both the
democrats and the republicans seem to be
quite united
that we should be making and buying
things from america
so uh yeah and i'm saying in the
comments somebody says i actually get
angry when i see china on a product
yeah we're no longer talking about
dollars and cents you know one
one entity can produce things much
cheaper than another
now you have to worry about the the
emotional part the anger
the direction of things the the
the amount of animosity that the
americans are starting to get against
the chinese
government not the people we like the
people
and that is all i wanted to say today i
just want to put that out there that if
you're a
business leader and you're looking at
china you're putting yourself at great
risk
reputationally and career-wise and i can
predict that things will probably get
much worse for china before they get
better that's all i wanted to say today
one topic and thanks for listening
