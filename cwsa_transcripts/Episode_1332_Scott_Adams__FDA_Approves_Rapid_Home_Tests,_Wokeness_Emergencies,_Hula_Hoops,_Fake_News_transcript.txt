hey everybody come on in come on in
yes we are exclusively
on youtube this morning i will look into
alternatives
to broaden my exposure
but i've been busy
i i got
i got two or three jobs going on here in
any given day so i'll get to it but for
the moment youtube it is and thank you
for uh joining me
but if you'd like to make this
extra good and i think you would all you
need is a copper mug or a
glass uh tanker chelsea stein a canteen
jericho flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
no not coca-cola
no
no
before this week yeah coca-cola could
have been a favorite liquid but not now
look at the news
all right join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's a simultaneous sip but it's
happening right now go
whoa
that that worked didn't it
well i would like to start out by giving
some kudos to the biden administration
i'll bet you hate that don't you you
know the trouble with uh
giving presidents credit or blame for
anything
is that
things always slop over right so you
never really know did
was this something that started during
the trump administration and then just
slopped over into the biden
administration
so the news is
that the fda just
authorized the first
coven 19 tests for repeated frequent use
at home
in other words cheap rapid tests
at home
no prescription
now
how big a deal is that
well the initial ones will be a little
too expensive
so
you know you're going to need rich
people to
to buy them to
show a demand
but i'm pretty sure that the
the market is going to get saturated and
the price will come down
so i wouldn't be surprised if it comes
down from i think it's eight dollars a
test which is too expensive but people
like me would use it right people have
some extra cash
i would definitely use a home test
that cost eight dollars i would maybe
wouldn't do it every day
but i could imagine an eight dollar home
test
i could see me doing it once a week
or something like that
or maybe more
but here's the the big story here
i don't know if this started during the
trump administration and it just took a
long time you may remember that i've
been pushing very hard
on the fda and saying in public a number
of times that you had to presume they
were corrupt
for not having done this sooner
so i'd like to revise
my assumption right so the assumption
was
that these rapid home tests were such an
obvious thing to be approved
there's just it just didn't seem like
there was any argument against it that
could be made
once you understood it if you didn't
understand the issue you could make an
argument but as soon as you understood
it all the arguments go away
and i thought the only reason
because of course the fda would
understand it you know not like the
public they would actually understand it
so for them not to approve it i said
it's somebody's got to be on the take
there's got to be some corruption
there's no other way to explain it
but
now that it is approved
we have to add a second hypothesis
so you have to keep the hypothesis that
there might have been some corruption
but i'm going to add to that the
hypothesis that maybe the bureaucracy is
just the bureaucracy
because we're all talking about how
amazing project warp speed was right
we wouldn't have vaccinations nearly so
quickly except that trump basically
kicked asses
and just said yes you will do this
no you will do this no you will do this
until they did it
but i don't think there was a project
warp speed
for these you know rapid tests it just
for some reason it didn't make that list
so it could be that it's just the
bureaucracy maybe it just takes a year
to do something to take should take a
day
because this should have taken a day
but it took a year well
closer to nine months i think it took
something like that
now
congratulations to michael amina uh
you've seen me tweet him a number of
times and i would say he was the primary
voice in the country
for this option to do lots of cheap
tests to
try to get on top of the virus now
um
i can't say enough good things
about what michael mena did for the
country
one of the strange things about this
pandemic
strange in a good way is that you saw a
number of people um and i like to think
i'm one of them
who just said well what can i do
right i can't do everything
but but what can i do
so you watched me go through that
process in public right i said well what
can i do to help and i tried to help by
doing you know largely what i'm doing
and
calming people down and
making sure people understood the
situation the risks and the rewards and
stuff
so a lot of people just sort of jumped
into the breach
just jumped in and said what can i do
michael mena probably would be the
superstar among them in my
opinion because he took personal risk
personal time
lots of effort
i mean he was doing media he was doing
uh articles
uh he was doing social media i mean he
pushed as hard as a as a private citizen
could push anything and i think he got
all the way to congress and was
influencing directly
so if i had to guess
and it's hard to tell but i think
michael mina made the
difference i think i think he made the
difference
and i am uh proud to say that i helped
boost him in my small social media way
as well as lots of other people and i
feel like this is
to some extent this is a victory of
social media as a form of government
i told you before that our form of
government has
transmogrified
into
a smart person in the public
who wants to put enough energy into it
gets to be in charge
in a weird way michael mina was a smart
citizen with good intentions
put the work into it
it was almost like he was in charge
in a practical sense because i do think
he pushed it over the
i think he pushed it over the line
i don't know how fast or even if it
would have happened otherwise
um
so um i'm gonna say kudos to the biden
administration for getting that done
uh but with the caveat that it may have
already been in the works it maybe it
just took a long time so we don't know
so we don't know how much of that was
trump how much was biden but the person
in charge
by our system the person who's in the
office gets the credit and also gets the
you know gets the criticism
so biden gets the credit he was in
office
um
we know that here's another thing that
looks good actually
that looks like the biden administration
will include
uh prominently nuclear energy as part of
their
recovery package etc future plans
so the byte administration is pro
nuclear it looks like and may may make
even uh more noise about it
so again
kudos to the biden administration for
being on the right side of
nuclear energy i'm not sure that was
easy
was was it easy for biden to be
pro-nuclear in
in a democrat party where
a big part of the party would be very
anti-nuclear
i think it takes some balls
all right i'm going to give them that
one right
there's plenty of criticism for the
biden administration right
but we're not going to be
we're not going to be nuts about it if
some good things happen some good things
happen let's call it out
and then i'll give a third thing but
this is more with a little question mark
on it
remember i asked you
do we know if this big 2.5
trillion dollar infrastructure package
package will improve the economy
or will it just run up the debt
and remember i said why don't we know
that
like why are we talking about this
and we don't even know if it's good or
bad for the economy
who's who's doing the calculations
well biden claims that it will be good
for the economy and uh even lower the
national debt in the long run obviously
raises it a lot in the short run
do you believe that
does your
does your gut feeling
does it
conform with the idea that this 2.5
trillion
will end up producing more good and and
tax benefits
than it will cost in the long run long
run being you know 15 to 30 years i
suppose
um what do you think
what does your gut feeling tell you
more positive or more negative
now the the trick here is that you don't
all have
economics training
right probably most of you don't
so
um seeing lots of no's
how would you know that though so i'm
not i'm not saying you're wrong all
right so without giving you my opinion
on this
i don't know if it will or not
to be honest but why would he be sure
what would cause you to be sure it's a
bad idea
because correct me if
i need to fact check on this but i
believe the
it must have been the
management budget office right whoever
does these scorings
it must have been scored by
a government entity
and it must have scored positively right
because the government does their own
calculation for their own plans and then
they tell the public this looks like it
will be positive or negative right
so i believe
real economists have said this is a good
idea
correct me if i'm wrong
can you fact check that
have economists said this is a bad idea
cbo i'm sorry
uh the yeah the the cbo
scores all the bills
and
i think they've scored it positively can
you do a fact check on that now here why
are we talking about this without that
being the number one thing
that
sets the context for every story about
this
what story are you seeing
so the story you're seeing on the right
is that it's not infrastructure
it's like only a small part of it is
roads and bridges
is that really a good point
well it's a good point if you make a
stupid
assumption and this stupid assumption
would be that the only thing that's good
is building roads and bridges
that would be a stupid assumption
it's good
but would there not be other things that
are good now i'm with you on the points
about if they're using it for racial
balancing and stuff
those conversations we need to get into
those in a little detail because i'm not
so sure that's well thought out
but on purely an economic level forget
about the social justice part for a
minute on purely an economic level
my gut feeling is it might be good
my gut feeling is it might be positive
now i have a background in economics
i've got an mba
if you don't have that kind of
background i would look to people who do
and you should look to people like me
although i'm you know at the very bottom
of people you should trust on a big
economic question
but at least i have more experience than
you do probably
so i would ask you if you're on the
right and you're concerned about
everything from inflation and you should
be
to national debt and you should be these
are all things to be rightly concerned
about
uh get some advice from economists
which is not to say the economists are
right
i'm just saying they might have some
perspective that would make you feel
more comfortable with this i have a
feeling this is more positive than
negative i just don't know if there's a
way to know it
right and then the social justice stuff
i don't think you can look at that as
economics exactly
all right
so that's all the good news
here's uh here's a question i asked
yesterday
and have you ever noticed that no matter
what point you make on social media
somebody will argue with it if you ever
notice that it's like a universal truth
right
you can make a bad point
on twitter and of course people will say
hey that's a bad point and they'll point
it out or
you could make a brilliant
perfectly supported point on twitter
and what will happen
exactly the same amount of criticism
because people really just criticize
based on what team they're on right
they're just going to look for something
but every now and then
and i can't say
i can even think of another example
but every now and then
somebody will say something
that will just stop the conversation
he'll just shut it down like people
won't even be able to talk about it
and and i managed to do one of those
tweets yesterday
and i want you to look at if you find
the tweet that wouldn't be hard to find
in my twitter feed watch how the critics
just disappeared
and here's what i did i simply took
the rules as they're given to us and
applied them
right so i'm not somebody who made up
some rules
all i did was say okay what are the
rules of society
okay and i'll just apply it to a
well-known situation that's it
now
here's the situation
uh vaccination passports and here's my
here's my tweet yesterday i said isn't
it racist
to require vaccination passports when so
many black citizens don't have
government ids
if you don't have an id how can you
prove it was you who got vaccinated
don't we have a problem here
if
if requiring ids to vote
is racist
requiring ids to prove he got vaccinated
is not less racist
it's exactly the same
it's exactly as racist
so i simply took the rules
applied it to this situation
what are the rules okay i'll just apply
it
and
how much pushback did i get
i think
none
i think none
i i mean maybe it's there but it was
probably be in the form of people just
insulting me you know
in general
i don't think
anybody criticized the point
i don't think so
and so
that's kind of the end of
vaccinations isn't it
the conservatives would simply have to
say it's racist
and refuse to participate
that's it
it's over
everybody who's worried about the the
passports changing your life and
everything
it's kind of over
you just say it's racist and walk away
now i don't know if anybody will do that
but if you want it to be over it'd be as
easy as that
now i got criticized quite a bit on this
vaccine vaccination
passport thing
because i noted that it might help you
open the economy faster
and other people said scott you idiot
there's no evidence that it will help
you
open the economy faster
to which i say hold on hold on
you're confusing me with somebody who
has certainty in uncertain situations
that's not me
i never i would never enter a situation
like this with certainty
that would be the dumbest position it
wouldn't matter what position you took
if you entered it with certainty that's
just dumb right
so
instead
i always go with a systems view and the
systems view looks like this
if there's something you can test
and then quickly abandon
if it doesn't work
it's worth testing
that's it
you've heard my whole opinion
so let's say that the government says
we're going to require these
vaccination passports
for a certain set type of business
and then that business
ends up failing
because so many people resisted it
that it was worse than if they never
implemented that idea at all
to which i say okay you tested it
you quickly found down it ruined your
business
all you have to do is stop doing it
it's very easy to reverse
if let's say you're a gym
and you say all right
we're at gyms we're a little more
close contact in here we're going to
require
vaccination passports
and the day you require it your gym goes
out of business
because everybody says well screw you
i'm just not going to participate i'll
go to another gym
and then what's the gym do
they immediately change their policy
because it was optional
so to me
if you can test something and then just
literally with a snap of a finger
reverse it
you know it's like today we require it
oh that didn't work
instead of opening the economy faster
which was the whole point
it actually opened it slower we tested
it we tried it for two weeks just made
everything worse
it's gone snap your fingers that's it
the gym just says oh take down the sign
on the front there's a sign on the door
that says you have to have a vaccination
just take down the sign
you've reversed the entire policy
that's it
now you're talking about the the
government a lot of people said to the
government
when the government does something they
don't like to give up on it well that's
definitely true if the government is
taxing
right so if you're looking for a
situation where the government
once taxed something
i wouldn't expect that to change
you know historically once somebody's
making money
yeah it's hard to change that but the
vaccination passports don't look like a
money maker for the government right
there's no politician who gets to build
a bridge
you know nobody gets a donation or
anything does the government doesn't
care
and the government would like fewer
fewer restrictions on themselves
you know you don't think
aoc wants to go to the gym
of course she does
right so
i would look at each of these situations
individually those who have said quite
reasonably that the government never
does a program or gains power and then
gives it back
to which i say they do it all the time
it's the most common thing our
government does is remove our rights
and then give them back when the
emergency is passed
when
let's say there's a curfew because
there's been rioting in the city
do you worry that the curfew will become
permanent
has it ever
has there ever been a permanent curfew
i can't they go on right
how about
when there's some kind of emergency
declaration
because there's a hurricane the
government says for now you can't do
this or that
when the when the emergency is over
don't they remove it
routinely right
now somebody says the patriot act
the patriot act has a money
element to it doesn't it
i believe the patriot act if you looked
at it you would find a lot of companies
uh sort of in the business of making
money on the patriot act and that makes
it sticky
so when you have a one so remember the
rule
just see if you would agree with this
rule
whenever a lot of money is involved
it's sticky
but a vaccine just a let's say
legislation that says
you need to show a card or or if a gym
wants to they can refuse service
who's making money so if the government
is not making money or if they're not
big industries that are making a ton of
money because of it i think you're okay
i think you're okay
let's take the fisa courts the problem
with the fisa courts
and i don't know the full details here
is that we didn't know
what the problem was
we suspected there would be lots of
people said hey there's going to be
problems sure enough there were
now once we discovered those problems we
have an opportunity to change them
right
so the problem with the fisa if you look
at the fisa thing what was the problem
a lack of transparency
so here's a second variable to look at
to know why each situation is unique
would the fisa court have ever changed
if if we had not accidentally gotten
visibility through this rush occlusion
stuff
if you have visibility
and nobody's making money in the
government or indirectly or directly you
have a good chance of reversing it
if you don't know anything's wrong
because you don't have visibility
why would you reverse it you don't know
if anything's wrong
and
and if there's money involved it's
sticky so here's my thing don't use bad
analogies to figure out what will happen
now also keep in mind that there are
some things which both left and right
does not like
and vaccination passports is in that
category
what do you think the black public in
the united states thinks about
vaccination passports
about the same as the conservative
public
right if you put republicans
and black citizens in this country on
the same side of an issue
i don't think you have to worry about it
that's as close as you can get to
guaranteeing that something's going to
go the way you want it to go
you put blacks and republicans on the
same team
it's pretty strong
all right so there's always a risk and i
think you are completely
i think you're completely reasonable in
worrying about things being permanent
that's a reasonable risk
and i don't deny that it's a risk
i just think you have to put it in
context a little bit better
um
so
there's that i i guess we have to talk
about this matt gates story some more
you know
nobody misses
trump more than
anybody who gets in the news lately
because you hope that the next story
will knock you off the headlines but
this matt gates thing is just going to
sit there until there's some new news
apparently we're not making any new news
lately because trump isn't in it
so here are the things we know
and there's so much
there's so much
like
creepy about this story
and i don't mean from you know matt
gates in particular i mean everything
about it is creepy
but there are some interesting questions
which have
arisen
number one it seems that
gates is
certainly being hurt by association so
there's this guy named greenberg
who has far more uh
specific and damning allegations
so the allegations against this
greenberg guy who matt gates
does know well enough he spent some time
with him
the greenberg allegations
look really really bad no doubt about
that
the gates allegations are different
and it also would completely explain why
gates would be
let's say a subject as opposed to a
target
because the evidence we have suggests
that matt gates would have information
that would be useful to the greenberg
question
so
and i do understand that some sometimes
and not
not rarely
somebody who's a subject can become a
target if they find out enough but that
doesn't have to go that way
so at the moment we don't even know
if anybody has any bad
you know verified information about matt
gates
so we in the public don't know that but
that's a little hidden
by the fact that they're doing this
guilt by association
and you know maybe this and maybe that
and it's alleged this and reported that
and there's so much smoke
that you can easily imagine that
something specific about matt gates has
been sad that's illegal
i don't know that's the case
and here's why i don't know and it's
because there's some things about the
law
that i find confusing
here
here well let me deal with this hula
hoop thing first so there's a story that
matt gates showed somebody a picture of
some naked women and one of them had a
hula hoop now
that is the most dickish thing
i've ever seen cnn report
imagine you're one of the women who had
spent some time with matt gates
and you heard that he'd shown some
pictures
of naked women to somebody
and you say to yourself
uh oh i hope that wasn't me
but at least you could assume maybe it
wasn't which would be at least some
comfort you'd say
well i'm sure i'm not the only one who
allowed him to take a naked picture
so it might have been somebody else
but as soon as cnn throws this hula hoop
thing in there
there is somebody in the world who knows
that's them
now what was the news value of including
this the hula hoop
detail
what was the news value of that
i get the news value of the larger story
but when you're talking about this
poor woman
who not only there's a naked picture of
her so that's bad enough
but they have to mention the freaking
hula hoop
so that she can know for sure
that somebody was looking at her naked
pictures
that is messed up
right when you talk about cnn being the
enemy of the people
it would be hard to find a better better
example than that
there is no news value to including the
hula hoop none
it just up this woman's life a
little bit extra
and she wasn't the one we were mad at
right
she's not the one who got elected
this is up
cnn up you just took a normal
citizen
and just
just ruined her year
right real good job cnn i mean this is
disgusting
everything that we've heard about matt
gates
and you could you can have your own
opinions about that i'm not gonna i'm
not gonna argue with you
how you what opinion you would like to
have about this story
please you're welcome to it i'm not
gonna talk you out of it but if you're
telling me that what he did even if it's
all true
even if it's all true it wasn't as bad
as what cnn just did right in front of
you
and we're we don't even have to wonder
if that's true
because cnn just did it in front of you
they just threw this woman under a bus
for nothing
just so you would have that little extra
thing in your head to feel bad about
matt gates
that's disgusting
that is disgusting
anyway so enough about that
here are some questions i have about
this whole situation you're probably
aware that the legal age
for consent
varies by state
did you know that what matt gates did
allegedly so we don't know if any of
this is true but if he allegedly was
with a 17 year old
what percentage of states
would that be legal
how many how many states as a percentage
of all the states
and how many states would that be
perfectly legal just guess
i think it's about 80 percent
yeah it's most
about 80 percent of the states don't
even have a law against it
not even any law now there's a separate
question about payment and a separate
question about state lines and we'll
talk about that
but the first thing you need to know
is that he's blamed for something that
80 percent of the states
don't even think should be illegal
that's important
but i have more questions
part of the allegations is that
there was
money involved we'll talk about that
separately but
money involved to cross a state line
to have for the purpose of having sex
what year is this
i thought this was 2021.
now i get that the federal government
needs to be involved if something
crosses state lines so that that part's
clear right because the state can't
handle it if it's a multi-state thing
the feds have to do it
but
why is this illegal
let me ask you this
let's say you were in one of the 20 of
the states ish
where uh
where being with a 17 year old if you're
an adult male let's say actually it
doesn't matter the genders you can
reverse the genders it's the same legal
question
and
let's say that you said hey
17 year old it would be totally illegal
to do what we would both like to do
willingly
in this state
so here's what we're going to do
i'll meet you in florida
where it's legal
and
since you don't have money i'll pay for
your trip
so it would it not and again this is a
question it's not a statement would it
be illegal
for someone to say
doing this activity is illegal in my
state
so why don't we spend a little money
and go
10 miles to the east and we'll be in a
different state where it's completely
legal
and then we'll do completely legal
things
and then we'll drive home
i think you go to jail for that
right
because that would be paying somebody to
cross state lines
for the purpose of sex
yeah some i'm seeing in the comments
somebody says
it would be illegal to go to a state to
do a legal thing
to do something that's legal
would be illegal
you get that
it would be illegal
to go do something
legal
because you crossed the state line to do
it
now do you think that was the point of
the law
do you think that the people wrote the
law said well we'll get these people who
who think they're going to be clever and
go do something
legal
so
that's my first question is how does
that work
secondly
um
there's the part of the story is that uh
there there was
one allegedly 17 year old
that matt gates allegedly had some
contact with that would be illegal
here's my question the second part of
the story
is that this greenberg guy was the one
who found her
and that he found her on a website
where women advertise you know that they
will
do things for for money
now do you think that that website that
she was on
where she was originally found
in which the whole point of the website
is money for sex that's the whole point
of it do you think that website let an
underage person sign up intentionally
do you think that they did
no
no
at some point
if this person exists we don't know that
yet but if there's a real 17 year old
she had to lie
about her age
to be on the site in the first place
right
so if she lied about her age to the to
the website which seems almost
guaranteed that that had to happen
because they wouldn't let her on
otherwise
what would that say about
both greenberg and
matt gates
is it illegal if you don't know
and is it illegal if all the indications
are that there's no law broken
now i get that i do understand that
ignorance of the law
is no excuse but that's not what this is
this would not be ignorance of the law
this would be ignorance of a fact
because somebody lied to you
somebody lied to him
if that's what happened we don't know
that that's the case
so
um
the only thing we've heard about matt
gayes is that there's one 17 year old
which would be legal in every state the
act
the paying the money for it
here's what's interesting about that
am i wrong that the left is pro-sex
worker
right
it seems to me that the left is very
pro-sex work
so it i would think that the left would
be defending matt gates of course not in
the real world but in terms of being
consistent they should say hey
yeah we get that it's illegal but maybe
it shouldn't be
now the the part about being 17 would of
course be illegal right
so the the part about the 17 that's
you know that's
automatically a problem okay by the way
is there anybody uh i'd like to see if
there any
that i'm gonna have a swearing alert
i should have warned you before
but is there anybody so dumb that they
think i'm defending matt gates now
in the comments let me see
all the dumb people will you will you uh
confess
how many think i'm defending matt gates
in the comments just go ahead and say it
because i want to see how many dumb
people are here
kinda one dumb person
um
see any more dumb people
um nope nope so a lot of smart people
okay
um somebody says florida is 18 yeah the
the point of course is just
the states are different
um no no no are you kidding no no okay
good so yeah i think that my audience is
um and i say this honestly i think my
audience is like
five times smarter than the average
public
right
so
you can talk about things without
defending them
you can say there's something good about
this and there's something bad about it
without being an apologist right i'm
glad that you're most of you are smart
enough to understand that
a lot of the world does not all right so
we don't know what matt gates did or did
not that's his business it's not for me
to defend him he's on his own on that
and he is he's on his own
but i just have these questions about
why
you know what makes it illegal if he
didn't know he was doing it
i feel as if you'd have to know you were
committing the crime
to be punished for it all right
so
that's that
um on the vaccine passport stuff i'm
seeing some people online saying that
they believe my opinion was based on my
own fear of mortality
and that
some people think i was more favorable
in concept to vaccine passports because
the real problem is i'm afraid of dying
because i'm old
let me say this as clearly as possible
i've had a good run
i don't fear death at all
not at all
i i spend zero time worrying about death
i really do not from the coronavirus not
from crime not from disease
i don't spend any time thinking about it
you know it's gonna come we all get our
chance right we're all gonna die
but
um i really don't think about it and i
certainly am not worrying about the
coronavirus killing me at the moment
you know yet
somebody says they don't believe me
now i suppose
i suppose uh
but you do get that my risk of death
is so small
that being concerned about that
particular risk
of all the things i could die of in the
next you know years
what are the odds that i would die of
coronavirus
you know that i know
the odds of that are vanishingly small
you know i'll probably get my
vaccination within a few days
my
my risk
it's just almost nothing
i only care about the economy opening up
in a good way because that's good for
everybody
so now i'm not worried about my personal
death it's literally the last thing i'm
worried about
um
let's talk about the floyd trial
you know i didn't think there would be
lots of twists and turns in this thing
but it's you know you're always
surprised when lawyers get involved
it's like reality just starts
changing right in front of you you know
you hear the defense and
reality changes you hear the prosecution
it changes again
and
i didn't think there would be twists and
turns but here's one
it turns out that when uh george floyd
was calling out for his mama
which is not funny like if don't think
i'm making fun of this this is all
serious
that he was calling for his mama as he
was taking his last breaths of life
apparently
that we found out that that's the the
nickname he uses for his girlfriend
and
while that's not important to the crime
it might be important how people
processed it
the the amount of energy that
an emotion that they put into it
somebody crying for their mother is
different from somebody crying for their
girlfriend right
now that doesn't mean he wasn't crying
for his mother
because it does seem
seems
sort of more likely that that would
happen right
maybe he just likes this word mama he
calls everybody mama i don't know
but we didn't expect that not that this
should change i don't think that'll
change the verdict in any way
now here's the thing we talked about
what makes something murder and i would
say
that there's no chance that derek shaven
was intending to murder him
and in fact the charges don't even don't
even include premeditated
but rather the charges assume that a
person in that situation would know
they were putting somebody in a they're
putting someone else in a situation
where the risk of death was high enough
that they shouldn't have done it
like they should have known not to put
somebody in that situation so that's
what makes it murder
okay you didn't try to kill him you just
put him in a situation you knew
could result in that and you didn't care
so you're sort of a murderer if you did
that
now let's say we accept that as a
standard
i'm not arguing forward or against it
i'm just going to ask ask you this
how would you not apply that to the
person who sold them fentanyl
because here's my point a drug dealer
generally knows that they're selling
fentanyl
but the person who buys it
might not
now i'm going to correct something i
said on a tweet
i may have said it out loud too i said
that and this is this is what i'm going
to correct but i first said no one
knowingly takes fentanyl
dealers put it in pills they sell as
xanax or or bars as they call them
and in other drugs
dealers know they're selling it but
buyers don't know they're buying it they
think they're getting some other drug
that's safer
and now under that condition would that
be murder
if the dealer knows they're putting a
buyer in a situation where the odds of
death
are pretty high
and they don't tell them
have they not murdered them should they
die of an overdose i say yes
i say that's murder
because they willingly put them in a
situation that is likely to die
and the person in that situation didn't
choose it
they did not choose to be in the
unlikely to die from fentanyl situation
so
why does law enforcement not
arrest the dealer
under exactly the same terms
and wouldn't it be interesting if there
were two murder trials
one for the police officer just as we
see
and a separate one for the the fentanyl
dealer
under exactly the same terms
now i heard somebody say scott scott
scott
you don't
you don't prosecute the dealer
because there's so many other things
involved you know the person who
willingly took the drug but which i say
they didn't willingly take the drug
they willingly took what they thought
was some other drug
right
and by the way the part i'm going to
correct
is when i said that the um
the buyer never knows they're getting
fentanyl i did hear from somebody who
knows more than i do saying no sometimes
the buyer does know they're getting
fentanyl
sometimes they do know
i think that is more typical when it's
not a pill
if you're buying a pill
it's usually uh counterfeited to look
like something else like a xanax for
example
so in those cases i don't think that
people know they're buying fentanyl
that's
probably what killed my stepson he had
fentanyl in him
he would never in fact he told me a week
earlier and
he would never touch something that
fentanyl he knew that
he knew it he knew a cold and a week
later he was dead from it
because he didn't know what was in it i
guess i don't know that for sure but
that's the the fair assumption
uh but there are people who are addicts
who do know what they're getting but
they also tend to be operating at a
higher level and they're going to be a
little more careful with it because they
know they have something deadly
now i don't know what the stats are but
my guess is that the people who know
they're buying something deadly
probably treat it like it's deadly and
may not have as many ods
as someone who didn't even know they had
it
because they're not trying to they're
not trying to protect themselves i'll
give you a specific example
i was told once
that um what kills fentanyl people
uh if they overdose and pass out is
their head goes down
and they cut off their own air supply
without waking up
because their head drips
drops down
and so i unders my understanding is if
you're an experienced addict and you
know you have fentanyl you make sure
that you're sitting in a chair with your
head back when you fall asleep
the odds of dying in that position are
way less
this is what i've been told and i'm not
100 confident about this
and that uh
there might be there might be some stats
that show that if you know you have
fentanyl you're much less likely to die
from it
don't know that's true but
you know i would look for that stat
anyway
i would say this
um
we don't
we don't prosecute the gun manufacturer
if somebody buys a gun and shoots
somebody because we say those are
different things it's legal to make a
gun it's not legal to shoot somebody so
it's the shooter that matters
in this fentanyl case the the fentanyl
dealer was the last person in the chain
it's like firing the gun the fentanyl
dealer is more like the person who
pulled the trigger because there's the
last person that gave you the bullet
and the bullet being the fentanyl
all right
um
here's another question that i have
can if you're on two knees let's say one
knee is on the ground and one knee is on
somebody's neck
can you transfer your weight
such that your knee that's on the ground
is absorbing most of the weight
and your knee that's on the suspect
is less you know just enough to make
sure he doesn't jump up
but you know far less than would take
than it would be to kill him
and
i was looking at the the most famous
photo
of shaven on the back of the on on floyd
take a look at all the photos and i
don't know if this will be in the
defense so it's just a question
if you look at the photos
you'll see that
shaven is not directly upright on his
knees
you'll see that he's cheating to one
side he's actually leaning
now
is the leaning
something that would cause the weight to
be
non-distributed in the right way
does the leaning show that he's putting
most of his weight on floyd which would
be the worst thing or does the way he
leans
suggests that maybe he's intentionally
you know not putting maximum force there
you can't tell exactly
but here's a test i would do if i were
the defense
i would take a
a weighing device
some kind of a scale that you put weight
on and it measures
i would in the scale let's say the scale
is about this tall about about similar
to a neck
and i would say
um client
derek shaven
put one knee in the ground in front of
the jury and put one knee on the scale
now push down on the scale
and you know it would show
you know 100 100 pounds of weight or
whatever he weighs
half of it
and
uh wouldn't be 100 pounds right and then
they would say okay
now put most of your weight on the floor
and let's see what the the scale says
and then then derek would just you know
do this
you'd you basically wouldn't be able to
tell
and you would see that the scale goes
from you know five pounds of pressure to
nothing or whatever
so
i feel as if if you're arguing
reasonable doubt
chauvin weighs about somebody says maybe
150 or so
yeah he looks at
i would think that if you're arguing
reasonable doubt you would have to know
how much pressure each knee was putting
down
and that there's no way to know
if the
if the coroner didn't find any damage to
the neck
and visually you can't tell because
remember the defense has to
has to defend against the videos and the
the photos
so people think they're seeing something
that they know what they're seeing on
the video and the photos
all you have to do is say
here's
look at my client he's right in front of
you
can you tell what pressure he's putting
on the scale just by looking at him
no you can't tell and once you can't
tell it and lie
live in person you would understand that
you also couldn't tell when you saw the
video
so
if the defense proves that the fentanyl
was enough that it could have killed him
i just don't see how anybody's going to
get convicted for murder might be some
other lesser charge i guess
um
all right is there anything else
happening
i'm going to look at your comments for a
moment
um
floyd's face was ground into the
pavement somebody says
but i don't know that uh
you know
i i would imagine that abrasions are
fairly common in in arrests where
there's some resistance
i don't know that that's the big problem
somebody's saying that floyd had three
times the amount it would take to
overdose here's my question there there
was some suggestion or allegation
that uh floyd may have taken some pills
when he got stopped so that they
wouldn't be discovered that's that's the
assumption now i don't think that's been
demonstrated right
somebody can tell me has the trial
has the trial presented any evidence
that he took any pills when he got
stopped
because even if he did
i don't know that they would work that
quickly
i don't think they would kill him in
nine minutes would they even if even if
it was too much fentanyl would it happen
that quickly
all right i don't know
um
yeah the dealer is the real killer
exactly i think the dealer should be
tried for murder
in fact i think every fentanyl dealer
should be tried for murder
uh drug tolerance varies considerably
yeah that's fair
um
he was yeah we know he was high before
the stop
we just don't know if he added to it
during the stop or if
the enough time had gone by that it made
any difference
all right lots of comments today
um
okay that's all i got for now
i will talk to you tomorrow
i added some more
micro lessons to the locals platform if
anybody would like to subscribe there
yesterday's lesson was how to tell a
good story
now by the way what i'm doing on the
locals platform is sort of a
in a way it's a lot of things but one of
the things it is is a test of how to
educate
using video as a tool and i'm trying
things
while educating my followers in a bunch
of micro lessons
that are designed to be specifically
very useful in your life right so very
practical stuff
and
i'm going to give you a preview of how
that's going
number one keeping them really short
seems to be really important it also
makes them easily searchable
and then you can go back etc
the other thing is
what online
teaching usually gets wrong is they just
take a regular teacher and say okay do
what you were doing before but just do
it in front of a camera
bad idea
and even if you take say an ivy league
instructor and say well this person's
teaching at stanford or harvard they
must be one of the best people there is
not necessarily they could be good at
publishing
right because that's how you keep your
job publish a lot of papers
so
i'm going to say something deeply
immodest
and i do it for the point of making the
point right if i don't if i don't do
that i can't make the point and the
point is this
i'm unusually good at explaining things
probably world-class
i would guess it has a lot to do with
the fact that's what i do for my job
right i simplify to make a comic
i simplify for books
i explain things in public so i'm kind
of a 30-year experienced explainer
people like me are kind of rare
but
you only need a few per topic and you've
got all the topics right
so if you found somebody who is one of
the best explainers
and put them on video you're not going
to get the same outcome as somebody who
just
got a good job at a good university
being an instructor
big difference big difference between
the best explainer
and somebody who just has a job in that
field
it would be like
you play basketball and michael michael
jordan played basketball
but you're not really the same
even though you both play basketball you
can't say there's anything in common
right
so the difference be the the thing that
online training has as the greatest
long-term potential
is that the the very best explainers
eventually will gravitate toward it but
not until
there's an economic incentive and i
think these micro lessons
will become a standard for education in
general
i think that a class will be a series of
micro lessons you know a 45 minute class
will
turn into three or four micro lessons
plus you know some gabbing about them
then when you go to study you just look
at the two-minute clip oh got it two
minutes got it
so
i think that's where everything's going
and
the experiment i would say has been a
huge success if you looked at the
comments from the people who are looking
at the micro lessons
they don't get bored
because they're short
it's on point with something that's
useful
and oh i guess here's the takeaway
and
i would say the pioneer in this was the
ted talks
how many of you have watched a ted talk
and thought to yourself that the reason
you're watching it is just entertainment
probably quite a few of you right but a
ted talk is information it's it's uh
education
it's a knowledge transfer
but you go to school
and it's also education and facts and
knowledge transfer and it's deadly
boring
what did ted what did the ted talks do
to change education
into entertainment
it's pretty obvious what they did
they kept it short
and they didn't get somebody who's just
pretty good at explaining things
they got the best person in the world
ish
for each topic
so when you're watching a ted talk
you're watching the best explainer
for that topic
you might ever see
and they keep it in 15 minutes
15 minutes is too long
you know 15 minutes did seem short when
ted started because we all had longer
attention spans right ted is
20 years old
25 years old
back then we we could watch three hour
things so when they said hey it's only
going to be 15 minutes people said what
how are we going to jam it all in 15
minutes and then it was easy
they all can do it
why because you're not asking bad
explainers to do it you're asking the
best explainers in the world
to get it into 15 minutes they can do it
they could also get it to five
if you watch a ted talk by
[Music]
2021 standards
um it looks
sort of like too long
somebody says 18 minutes i don't know if
it is i thought it used to be 15.
so
that's where everything's going the ted
talk started it i'm just extending it it
makes a huge difference
and
i think that's
going to be great for
for education in the future
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you tomorrow
