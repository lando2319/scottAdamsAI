[Music]
hey everybody
hey bill good to see you everybody
come on in it's time it's time for
coffee with scott adams
you may have some other things to do
because this is sunday maybe
church related things but keep your
priorities straight
it's time for coffee with scott adams
and all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker gels
or stein a canteen jug or flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine the other day the thing that
makes
everything better except apparently
the riots but we'll work on that it's
called the simultaneous sip it happens
now
go
well let's start with the good news
the good news is that the trump campaign
now has a navy
and an air force did you see the uh
trump
boat parade that's a lot of boats
and amazingly uh they found a way to
have a gigantic event
that did not clog the streets so good
for them
i would be really worried if i were a
joe biden
supporter and i couldn't find so much as
a lawn sign
for joe biden the the only kinetic
energy
that joe biden is creating in terms of
people
moving their bodies their arms and legs
or
or a vehicle moving in some way the only
actual
motion created by biden is antifa and
and uh the blm riots and stuff
so biden biden is creating riots
trump is inspiring boat parades
and the polling is still close what kind
of a weird country is this
so um the funniest thing that happened
and of course we're at that point where
we're laughing at tragedy of other
people
because that's the kind of people we are
did you see the new anti-fun dance move
it doesn't have a name yet i think it
might be called something like
the molotov or possibly hot feet
but it involves i can't do it because i
can't stand up on camera here but
it involves catching one foot on fire
and then
sort of cross stepping until you jump on
the ground
and then roll back and forth in the
ground and then sometimes
sometimes your brilliant helpers will
try to put out the fire
with and here's the best part if you're
going to put on a fire
on somebody's leg while they're writhing
and rolling on the ground
there are some tools that are better
than other tools
if you saw the video i'm referring to on
social media of the
anti-fog person dancing with their leg
on fire
you know that one of the helpful friends
tried to help put it out
with what looked like the top of a
garbage bale
now the top of a garbage pail just so
you can picture this
is largely flat-ish except for you know
its edges
and probably one way to not put down a
fire
on something that's an irregular size
and flailing
like a leg is to put a flat metal object
and keep keep pounding on it
so that the people who have better ideas
can't get there
so i don't know what was funnier the guy
with his leg on fire
or with a guy
or the guy who was helping
i've watched that thing like 10 times
and every time i just can't stop looking
at the guy with the
garbage
the garbage pail lid it was just not
helping he's not helping at all
[Laughter]
i shouldn't be laughing at this so cruel
so it looks like the hashtag biden riots
is is catching on
i just used it before i it came on
and there were i think 470 uses of biden
riots
in the last i don't know hour or
whatever do you think that's enough to
make it trend
nope damn dancing with fire
you know know you know i'm gonna make a
video with that dance move later
you know that's coming uh so
i i don't know if this is happening but
it looks like the whoever's in charge of
what
trends is trying pretty hard to make
biden riots
not trend it looks like there might be
some manual intervention
but i can't say that for sure but a lot
of people are using that
hashtag and it's not going anywhere it
doesn't show up in the trending
all right um i
last night i registered to vote
that doesn't sound like a big deal to
you but the last time i registered to
vote
i don't remember because
as you as you know i famously don't vote
because it would make me biased now i'm
already biased
so probably doesn't hurt in this case
but
normally i wouldn't have bothered
because i yeah i live in california it
just doesn't seem to make that much
difference my one vote
and i'm happy that other people vote
makes the system feel like it's credible
but i'm only voting for self-defense i
mean
actually literally self-defense i i
don't mean that as a joke i'm not being
sarcastic
it's actually just purely safety
because when you look at the what's
happening with
the with the biden riots uh it looks
like
it could get out of control i don't
think it will
but it looks like it could certainly has
that potential
so here's a little uh psychological uh
question for you this has more to do
with psychology than whether it's
practical suppose suppose there was some
state
who wanted to end the
the protests and suppose this state said
hey we've got a lot of land we're not
using
why don't you just make your perfect
society on this land that we're not
using
you can do anything you want form your
own government
run it just the way you want to just
don't involve us
because here's the thing nobody is
really stopping
anybody from living the way they want to
live are we
is there anybody in antifa who can't go
and just sort of live the way they want
to live
and if we are stopping them from living
the way they want to live
well we should stop doing that why not
let them have
whatever they want just just don't do it
around
us the only requirement i have
is why do you have to do it with my
stuff
why can't you just go live your life
with your stuff
i'll live my life separately with my
stuff you live with your stuff
why can't we both be happy just be
separate
and here i'm not talking about black
lives matter i'm talking about antifa
in particular i'm talking about people
who want a different system
why don't we give it to them or why
don't we really mess up their heads
and offer it to them because you know
what they don't want
they don't want to run anything they
don't want to be in charge
antifa doesn't want to be in charge of
anything i say we round them up
and put them on some kind of an anti-far
reservation
and just say hey guys this is all yours
you have all the freedom in the world
call it whatever you want
make up your own set of rules we just
don't want to be involved
we only want to be away from you that's
all we want
we don't want you to be different we
don't want you to change
we just don't want to be around it
that's all
now i think there's enough space
in the country because the the total
number of antifa is not that big you
know if you added them all together a
few thousand
put them on a reservation and and say
look
if you can get somebody to send you free
food you don't even have to work
we're not going to send you free food
but if you can find people who will
good for you and you don't need to
spread your revolution
to us because anybody who would rather
live in a non-capitalist
non-democratic society they'll have an
option
they can go live in the mud and disease
with the rest of you
it seems like a good idea now of course
it's completely non-practical wouldn't
happen in the real world
but the beauty of it is the mental part
of that what if you gave them what they
were asking for
right is sort of like the dog chase in
the car don't you have that feeling
about
the the riots the biden riots that if
they got
everything they wanted they sure
wouldn't be happy about it
so why don't you why don't we create a
picture in their heads
of them getting what they want because
it's a well-known
trick of persuasion that if you can make
somebody think through to the future
and it's a bad future or a good future
depending on which way you're trying to
persuade
that that imagined future will affect
their decisions today
so rather than let them live with some
idea of an
ideal antifa where everything's good
and we've all got food and health care
and things are great
why don't we say look you can build your
own chas or chop or whatever you want
it'll be totally legal we're just we
just don't want to have anything to do
with you
we just want to have no contact with you
whatsoever that's all that's all we're
asking
no contact and let them do their thing
but you could draw you could you could
force them to imagine
what that would be like until they
didn't want it anymore you know what i
mean
because right now they're just imagining
some collection of things which might be
better
it's not really a coherent image of the
future
they don't have one so why not give them
one
why not give them the gift of imagining
their own
future accurately that would be a good
gift
and just say it's going to be here so
you can imagine what it will be
now imagine how much fun you'll have
with your no money
you know police and you know healthcare
because that's what you're that's what
you're trying to give all of us
why don't we give to you what you are
trying to gift
to us the gift of no no modern society
the gift of no law enforcement the gift
of
fear every time you walk outside why
can't we give that back to you
this is our gift to you you can have all
this land
now again it's more of a mental trick
because you want them to imagine what
what happened if they got what they
wanted
what would it look like maybe you
wouldn't like you so much
um watching the video from the binding
riots last night
in portland the fireworks stuff is just
really weird
because i can get that the fireworks are
you know mostly
non-deadly non-lethal and you know
mostly it's just to
create noise and you know maybe brush
the police back if that's what they're
doing with the fireworks
but it looks like literally a pretend
war zone
literally pretending to have a war using
fireworks and
non-lethal stuff instead of lethal stuff
it is the weirdest pretend situation
um that you've ever seen all right
are we done with the atlantic uh stuff
i feel like that didn't even last 48
hours
the whole president trump uh was mean to
the troops
now i guess is one of those situations
where you don't even need to talk about
whether it happened or didn't
because it doesn't matter it doesn't
matter if the president ever said
those words or didn't because his
supporters will think he did not say
them
for the most part his detractors will
say he did say them and it doesn't
matter if he did
it actually doesn't matter the literal
literally the reality
of whether it happened or didn't happen
no difference doesn't matter at all it's
the the truth of it is not even a
variable here
which is weird um
i think that we've discovered a new form
of energy
um and this is this is brand new this is
only this week
if you haven't heard about this it's a
pretty big deal
and the way it works is um
that they they hook a generator around
the lifeless body of steve jobs
and then as steve jobs spins in his
grave
why assume he is i mean that's just a
safe assumption
as he spins in his grave they put
magnets on his body
and the spinning of steve jobs body in
the grave
against the you know against the other
magnets and the
generator creates energy and
as his widow squanders his money
on propaganda for the biden riot's
inspiration one imagines what steve
jobs would have thought of this
situation in which his widow
is using the money he created over his
lifetime
to support rioting and possibly a civil
war in the united states
oh yeah steve jobs must be so happy
about what happened to his money after
he left but on the good side it's
generating a lot of electricity
so lorraine laureen laureen jobs
you have completely uh
destroyed his legacy and so i guess he
didn't see that coming
um so there's more reporting on that
reinhold guy the the guy who shot the
trump
well i guess he would be a police
supporter a blue lives supporter
and uh the new video shows that he was
actually
lying in wait and it looked like it was
just organized
uh it completely obliterates his his
alibi before he was killed
by the police and obliterates his alibi
that he it was some kind of self-defense
thing
it was obviously just he laid in wait
and uh he was it was just a planned hit
uh now add that because that was clearly
a case
and people have been saying this on
social media that was
clearly a case of a trump supporter
being haunted
there's no there's no other word that
fits right because he wasn't robbed
it wasn't self-defense it wasn't heat of
the moment
he was identified tracked if he will
you know kind of kind of knew where he
was they set up the kill point
it was organized he was hunted
is that word not accurate we also saw a
video of some of the walk away people
brendan stracha and carlin
carlin who's last name on black guy on
right now
and they were showing the video of being
followed by the anti-fog
people and basically being chased away
at great
personal risk did it look like they were
being hunted
it did it looked like live video of
trump supporters being haunted in public
right out right there on the street
and being chased away now it looked
pretty seriously dangerous
so i don't recommend anybody get near
those protests
if i feel like that's a bad idea for
your safety
if you would like to do a simulation
of what it would like to live in a abide
in
future i have a little exercise you can
do
now normally it would be difficult to
imagine yourself in the future
you know at least accurately but i think
this is a little
a little exercise that i created in
which
you would be able to experience today
fully just a full experience today of
exactly what the future would be like
should biden win and the anti-fog blm
people
get their way and here's how you can
simulate it today
you what you do is you would gather up
all of your possessions
and maybe put them on a carpet in one
place
douse them with gasoline set them on
fire
while everything that you've owned in
your life and have worked for
is is on fire you want to use that time
to punch yourself as hard as you can
until you pass out
now once you've passed out and i can't
guarantee this last part but you know
fingers crossed if you do everything
right
some nfl team will put your name on a
helmet for being
in a sense a hero if you will so that's
how you would experience
the biden future but today
um all right what is the uh oh
then trump is getting provocative but
he'll totally
be able to get away with this so as you
know he
already canceled within the government
training on critical race theory
so the federal government just can't do
that anymore it's considered
un-american and against
everything that we care about
but the question remains i think jack
passable
was asking this on twitter does that
include the military
is the military included in trump's ban
of the critical race theory training
don't know
i'd like to know that but just to pile
on a little bit
more apparently trump is considering and
i think tom cotton likes this idea he's
promote he's
he's got some kind of legislation on it
that the federal government is
considering defunding
or not funding schools that teach the
1619 project
which would be california schools to
start with i guess there's some of them
now the 1619 project is the
was it the new york new york magazine
project
in which they sort of reframe the
history of the united states
through a uh slavery is the most
important
filter kind of a lens
and critics say that that is not an
accurate view
i'm not a historian so i'm not going to
weigh in on what's accurate or not
about that but i don't think that the
president could have gotten away with
this so easily
if not for the biden riots so if you're
wondering what the biden riots
have bought so far what they've bought
so far
is much worse feelings about race
for sure the end of reparations as a
conversation that's not going to happen
certainly it will get rid of these 16 19
projects
in schools probably get rid of critical
race theory
in at least in the government if not
corporations
so i would say the biden riots are so
far getting them everything they didn't
want to get
in other words it's caused already a it
made it easy for trump to get rid of the
1619 project
if he succeeds from the school system
and it made it easy for trump
to say get rid of critical race theory
because
the biden riots have so spoiled that
um let's say that the philosophical
purity of
any of that message to the extent it
ever had philosophical purity
but now it's completely gone you know
the
the credibility of the movement is
completely depleted at this point
so the president can do that whereas
maybe before it would have been
politically impossible
at this point it's just easy um
there's a story about one of the black
lives matter protesters
who's facing a felony charge for rioting
um i saw was a uh and somebody who was
actually literally smashing windows
is a wealthy uh upper east sider a 20
year old
so whose mother is an architect and her
father is a child
psychiatrist so clara crabber
aged 20 she was one of eight people
arrested for
a hundred thousand dollars in damage on
foley square
her her father is a child psychiatrist
now if you're a child psychologist
and your child who is raised in
privilege
joins antifa gets arrested breaking
windows downtown
could it be said that you're the best
child psychiatrist in the world
well you might actually be because i'm
not sure that child psychiatrists
are that effective in other words
it doesn't change somebody's life you
know reliably
i'm sure it's useful but uh he couldn't
he didn't have enough power to change
his own kid's life
and i'm not making fun of him because i
don't think
just being a child psychiatrist gives
you superpowers you can't
can't change somebody who's really dead
set on being some other person
but uh that's not really good for his uh
that will not be not look good on his
yelp reviews if you know what i mean
okay i shouldn't laugh about that uh
here's a question for you
what what backup plan do we have we
meaning the citizens of this country
if the local governments and therefore
law enforcement
abandon us so what happens if the
if the mobs just grow in power
because the police and law enforcement
just
don't have the support of the local
governments and they also don't call in
the feds
and uh kurt schlichter had a really good
article in
town hall i think about why it's not
really practical to call in
federal forces let's say the national
guard
unless the city is welcoming welcoming
them and giving them the
the backup that they need for example if
your
federal forces came in and arrested a
bunch of people
well where do those people go once
they're arrested
they sort of need to work with the local
governments to put them in local jails
and
process them locally etc but if you
don't have the local support you can't
really do anything with outside forces
very well you would have to like send in
a whole army to get it done because you
need all the logistics
to come with the forces if you don't
have logistics in other words how do you
feed them how do they go to the bathroom
and all that stuff
where do they get their supplies if you
don't have all that
you got to bring it with you so it's not
really easy for the federal government
to just say
we'll just bring a zillion people in and
take care of it it's a
big big operation and not to be taken
lightly
so what happens if law enforcement just
gives up
and the let's say the anti-farm mobs
start spreading into the suburbs
what do you do so at this point it's
just an open question
but there's part of a suggestion
embedded in this
we probably need to have a shadow
government
that's ready to go at least in the gov
in the guerrilla warf warfare sense
so something that is not anti-us
government
but rather an augmentation to it
something that would protect it if it
can't protect itself
which is the idea of the militia of
course
but our militias are local
and they're not really coordinated as
far as i know who would be the leaders
of such a counter-counter revolution
you know who what kind of structure
would you have
if the citizens wanted to push back
against antifa
and they had no police or government
muscle to help them how would they do it
well i would suggest that we should
start thinking about
forming an actual structure so that
there would be
at a minimum there would be
communication so that you could organize
and here here's why it's important
um correct me if i'm wrong here here's
just a fact
check fact check do the protesters
in portland do they have a camp
do they have like a base camp with tents
i think they do right can somebody fact
check me on that i might be confusing
seattle or something with portland
but i feel as if these protesters go
somewhere to sleep
and they probably don't stay at hotels
and they're probably not all local
so is there not a physical tent
city somewhere that they all go to when
they're resting up for the next riot
because it seems to me that the people
who wanted to be the
the resistance to the resistance if you
will should know where that
is and if you had enough people who were
let's say resistant to the resistors
they would just mass near that
that tent area and just walk through as
a gigantic
mass of people and just dismantle it and
you wouldn't even necessarily have any
any violence because if you had enough
people
the others are going to back up right if
you add ten to one
in numbers they're not going to defend
their tents very long
you know a little bit of pushing and
they're going to be gone so suppose you
just swept through and just took
every every one of their possessions
suppose
you grabbed them and stripped them like
actually stripped their clothes off
and they just released them and you took
every article of their clothing
all right down to their socks you just
grab them hold them
strip them and release them and you take
of course that would be you would be
getting their hidden guns and
weapons and stuff and everything but you
wouldn't be
you wouldn't be arresting them you would
effectively be
only hurting their merchandise their
merchandise would be the clothes that
they're wearing
right so you would just give back to
them what they gave to you which is a
purely
material fight because antifa
is mostly uh trying to destroy goods and
storefronts and buildings and stuff like
that they are
they have you know there have been
humans who have died
but that's not their primary thrust they
are trying to destroy
stuff so if there was a reaction to the
reaction if you will
a counter revolution to the revolution
shouldn't we
also consider going after their stuff so
get rid of their tents
grab them and hold them strip them of
all their clothing and goods and then
just release them
somebody would immediately give them a
coat you know you wouldn't have to worry
about the
nudity or anything or maybe you only do
it to the men you know if if you're
if you're trying to uh let's see do the
least
damage let's say you just did it to the
men you know don't
don't be stripping the women on the
street that's a different situation
but just strip them in completely strip
them
and then just release them
so if anybody tried that without massive
numbers there would just be bloodshed so
don't try this
there are some ideas that you shouldn't
do at all until you have a ten to one
physical advantage and then you can do
anything you want
and somebody says turn off their cell
phones yeah that would be
a way to go somebody says i'm not
touching them right
you know you'd have to wear gloves and a
spit hood i guess
um their merchandise is provided for
them
okay just keep taking it away and
as long as it's stuff for stuff it's
hard to get
you're not going to get any more punish
than they are
and the beauty is that antifa might be
destroying things that would be
um you know felonies because it has a
big dollar value
but if you simply took somebody's
clothing
what's that is that even much of a crime
small misdemeanor maybe
no i guess it would be the physical part
so it'd still be probably a felony
anyway
uh put trump stickers on their cars
there's an excellent idea
uh identify all the anti-fog vehicles
and put trump stickers
bumper stickers on
so here's my point it would be a bad bad
bad idea to do
anything like that any kind of citizens
moving against antifa
unless the citizens had organized to the
point where they had
massive numbers just such massive
numbers that even the law enforcement
couldn't do a thing
now if you've got massive numbers
you can kind of do anything you want but
short of massive numbers
don't do anything i would say just wait
and see how things are developing
but shouldn't we at least organize
should we not know
exactly who's in charge of the
counter counter revolution and again we
should stay completely legal
because what i'm suggesting is
protecting the united states not
overthrowing it and i'm suggesting
returning to law and order not
having less of it so we shouldn't do
anything that's
illegal but couldn't you organize would
it not be completely
legal to organize effectively a
neighborhood watch but for the whole
country
how hard would it be
all right um yeah and i don't know
what's happening with the the ricoh laws
i'm guessing that there's a lot
happening behind the scenes in terms of
looking for leaders and arresting them
and such
my computer is starting to come to life
and make noise
i don't know what's up with that all
right um there's not much else
happening so i'm going to keep it uh
keep it short today spray them red
somebody says
you know in let me turn this off
you know i used to be a bank teller and
we used to have these uh exploding money
packs if you got robbed you would
try to give them one of the packs of
money that has exploding
dye in it and what it would do is they
would just coat the
the bank robber with this blue ink so
they couldn't blend into the background
it'd just be obvious that they just
robbed the bank
there might be something like that there
might be a way to
tag antifa but
i wouldn't use paintball guns apparently
that causes trouble
um
solving problems is a good discussion
yeah the one thing that i think we can
all agree
is that none of these uh none of these
riots are about
solving problems would you agree because
in order for antifa or black lives
matter to solve the problem
the minimum require whatever problems
they're trying to solve
the minimum requirement would be that
they had some kind of a leadership
that they recognized and therefore could
negotiate
on their behalf and that leadership
would narrow down
all the things that could be asked for
to some group of things that might be
possible and then they would find
somebody to negotiate with
because there's money there might be
laws it might be things that need to be
changed
and then they would get busy doing that
now they might do it at the same time
the protests are going on as part of the
pressure
but if you don't see that if you don't
see a
leader who has specific demands
and is authorized to negotiate you're
not seeing
black lives matter that's not what's
going on
you're not seeing antifa trying to make
the world a better place
there's nothing like that is pure
destruction
unless they have something they're
asking for if
if you just have individuals you know
somebody says well
i'm sort of on this side of black lives
matter or write an article saying the
things that i think
would be good and then somebody else
writes another article
with some overlap but different things
that would be good
that's nothing until you have somebody
in charge who can negotiate for all of
you
you don't really have anything it's just
a bunch of people destroying stuff
so it would be a mistake to see this as
some kind of a
political move that's trying to improve
the lives of the people involved
it's nothing like that because it would
look completely different
if that were the intention i think it's
mostly just anger
and lots of different motives that came
together
so those
somebody said they had to refollow me
yeah
yeah the social media manipulation will
probably get extreme in the next
next several weeks um
and isn't it imagine isn't it amazing
that we can just
talk about it out loud nobody doubts
it's happening and here what i'm talking
about is the
the fact that people get unfollowed
automatically on twitter
now i don't know if it's only people who
are associated with trump
i just don't know if other people are
being unfollowed but the fact that
it even happens at all and it's
happening massively and all the time
how in the world are we still putting up
with that
or at least don't know why it's
happening you know some more specific
answer about why it's happening
how is that okay but we just get used to
anything
all right that's all i got for now
and i will talk to you tomorrow
