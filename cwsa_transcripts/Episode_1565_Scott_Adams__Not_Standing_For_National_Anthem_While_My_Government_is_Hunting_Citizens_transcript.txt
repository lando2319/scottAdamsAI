um
good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that will ever happen to
you ever ever and the rest of your life
uh somebody's saying that I kneel for
the national anthem no no I don't kneel
for anything
just to be clear
I'm not going to kneel for the national
anthem and I'm not going to kneel for
the black national anthem or any other
anthems
because I'm not going to kneel for
anything
period I might not stand up but that's a
different now standing up is different
well we'll get into all of that let's
say that on a controversy level today
will be a 10 and a 10. do you like your
controversy and your news do you like it
I know you do you love it
you love it
savor it savor it
all right if you wanted to make this day
special
more special than it already is and it's
already pretty great all you need is a
cup of a glass of tanker Chelsea Stein I
can't even Joker flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like
coffee
wait a minute wait a minute hold on I'm
getting a report
this from Ben Greenfield uh tweet says a
study of the Japanese adults found that
higher intakes of coffee were associated
with a 51 lower risk of dementia yeah
and green tea didn't help a bit well
screw your green tea coffee will take
your dementia down to nothing
and now the simultaneous sip go
foreign
I don't know about you but I do feel my
dementia going down a little bit
approximately 51 50 51 that's what it
feels like
oh antibodies antibodies coming online
going hot
all right uh you know most topics in the
United States end up coming down to left
and right you had got your Democrats and
you got your liberals
you got your conservatives and your
Public's Republicans on the other side
but there is one topic
that does not seem to line up by party
it's a topic of federal legalization of
weed
it's the only topic that is lined up by
smart people on one side
and then stupid idiots on the
other side
am I wrong
because on the side that wants you know
to legalize and you know stuff like that
you've got your Rand Paul's Republican
he's in favor of loosening up on the
federal stuff but you also have lots of
Democrats
and I would I would guess that if you
took all the Republicans who are in
favor of loosening up and all the
Democrats who were in favor of loosening
up you'd probably have something pretty
good
why is anybody on the other side
yeah the Libertarians do
who's on the other side
because Chuck Schumer is and I guess
some Republican leadership is
this is not about
left or right is it this is not about
that's the weirdest comment I've ever
seen I'm not going to read it uh I
totally threw off my game but
you bastard you bastard You Know Who You
Are
that was pretty funny all right I'm not
going to share that with you
um
but in the the topic of weed
legalization really let's let's stop
calling this political
there are well-informed people who think
we should loosen up
and there are idiots who think
we should
that's it this is the one topic where
it's just smart people and idiots and
it's the cleanest it is the cleanest
topic I've ever seen on this are there
any other topics you've ever seen
in which it broke down not by political
party
it broke down by smart people and
 idiots
can you think of anything else like that
honestly is there any other topic like
that
yeah term limits I don't know term
limits sorted
I think that can be all over the place
yeah okay
um Bill Barr continues to be the most
interesting person in political
commentating
because he's doing this uh
something fairly heroic
which he's trying to turn the ship on
his side
but I swear to God he's doing a
single-handedly it's like he doesn't
have any help at all
and what I mean is he's the the only
person with one eye in the land of the
blind
and he's realizing what the left is
doing he can see the overreach
I guess that's the best way to see it
say it he can see that he still likes
you know the left in terms of General
politics but he can see the overreach
and he's trying to push back about that
you're using his platform and he had an
interview with Chris Cuomo that I
definitely recommend you watch
because uh and I I hope I can do this
justice but you have to see Bill Maher
correct a Cuomo in the gentlest way I've
ever seen anybody corrected on anything
and it's it's kind of brilliant I mean I
my instinct was he should have gone
harder at it but when I think about a
little bit more I think the pacing and
the leading are important
so here's the setup
Cuomo says that nobody even understands
what CRT means much less do we teach it
in school it's not being taught in
school and we don't even nobody even
knows what it means
but it's definitely not being taught in
schools
so that's what Cuomo says on CNN your
trusted news source station he says this
to Bill Maher Bill Maher of course knows
this is a lie
in kind right it's not a direct lie but
it is intended to mislead
clearly because the answer is that the
CRT ideas are baked into the into the
curriculum in a lot of schools
and they just don't call it CRT because
they're not teaching the theory they're
just taking parts of it and embedding it
in the in the curriculum
so that gives us CNN enough cover to say
it doesn't exist
but it does exist and Mar Del Mar knows
it exists he says he read up on it there
it is
son himself all right there's no
question that exists it just isn't
called that it's just embedded
and you have to see
how gently Bill Maher without actually
disagreeing with him corrects him it's
actually really in terms of quality of
communication it's really good I don't
know I was just impressed with how he
did it that you could see somebody
totally fact checked
and and I guess I guess here's the frame
that makes it interesting CNN is
supposed to be the news so CNN is the
one supposed to be bringing the facts
their guest
fact check them on live TV
and didn't even get a pushback because
he did it so cleverly
there was nothing to push back
it was really it really done well
all right nuclear energy is the new
solar panels that's that's me talking
nuclear energy is the new solar panels
meaning it's the new the new thing it
thing Indonesian government said they
plan to replace their coal plants with
nuclear because they have some questions
about the viability of solar and wind
and geothermal
now almost every story you've seen about
nuclear energy in the past
six months
all positive right
and the exception
a hundred percent of the news coverage
of nuclear energy for the last six
months
is positive
you've never seen that before
right
I'm not wrong am I it just all turned
positive all at once and not only did it
turn positive but people are getting
that it's the replacement for solar
power or an alternative or an addition I
wouldn't say replacement
um this is gigantic and I have to ask
how much did Mark Schneider's influence
on this topic matter
because he influenced a lot
uh how much did Michael schellenberger's
influence on this topic matter yeah
because I think Sheldon Berger and Mark
Schneider were the two voices that I
heard the most and I tried to boost
their signal as much as possible
in my case I'm just a booster
um
but I feel like there was this giant
Battleship that was going in One
Direction and there were just a few
little tugboats like
trying to move it a little bit and I
think it changed directions
yeah Bill Bill Gates invested in a
nuclear power company that's true
um
how much did The China Syndrome poison
perception probably a lot because movies
make a big difference probably a lot
all right so that's good news nuclear is
moving in all the right direction so
that's your golden age coming
uh as Joe Concha noted in a tweet today
Ron DeSantis is holding a press
conference
today which is not the interesting part
the interesting part is he chose to do
it in a town in Florida called
Brandon
and he's going to be at a Honda
dealership called
Brandon Honda
good job Ron DeSantis I doubt it's a
coincidence probably not a coincidence
so good job trolling wise
Rasmussen polls uh has a poll result
today that says 55 percent of people who
are asked the voters I guess say Bannon
prosecution is politically motivated
55 percent
just think about this
55 of the country
thinks that they just watched a man be
arrested
without a crime and that the government
is doing it to punish him for political
reasons
now I don't know if there's a crime or
not I'm no expert on that but it does
look like it's a political prosecution I
mean I guess technically it's a crime
because he he's not showing up for uh
to testify
[Music]
um also Rasmussen asked about the
O'Keefe raid you know the project
Veritas stuff and 52 percent of the
public say that's politically motivated
abandoned no no Keith to people
associated with the political right and
over half of the country so that's more
than just Republicans right this is over
half of the country in both cases say
this looks politically motivated
there's something happening
do you feel it
this is part of the story let me I'm
going to piece together the whole
tapestry as we go but this is important
that it's not just the right who notices
now that the government has overreached
because at 55 percent you're you're way
past the number of Republicans
you're into the Bill Maher territory
where even the the reasonable people on
the left are saying wait a minute that's
a little too far
let's keep going
um you heard that uh Jacob chansley he
was the so-called Q Anon Shaman the guy
who was part of the January 6. protest I
called the protest you got 41 months in
federal prison
uh one of the longest sentences handed
down so far in connection with the event
so he got one of the longest sentences
did nothing violent
didn't threaten anything violent
didn't do anything violent
they said that his little flag thing was
a weapon because I had a flagpole
um this is a political
prosecution
so now we've got Bannon O'Keefe and
Jacob chensley now I'm not saying he
didn't break a law I'm saying that the
penalty is clearly to make an example of
them now let me say this as clearly as I
can
um I can't stand for the national anthem
anymore
just a personal thing you can do
whatever you want I'm not trying to
convince you and I'm not uh siding with
black lives matter and I'm definitely
not going to kneel for the national
anthem because I don't kneel for
anything
right I just don't kneel for things it
doesn't matter what it is
so I'm not going to be kneeling for
anything but I don't think I can stand
for a government and I realize the
national anthem is not the government
per se but you get the point you know
that our our Nationals our national
symbols
they have two purposes one is to unite
the country but the other is it gives us
a protest
Focus
so they're kind of Handy in two direct
directions that way
and personally I don't want to I don't
want to show respect for a country that
would use somebody as an example
if you say write out loud we're going to
make an example of somebody I'm done
with you
I'm that's not a government I support
nope you can put somebody in jail
because they committed a crime
cool
but if you put somebody in jail extra
long to make an example of him
not cool
not cool no respect for that so going
forward I won't be standing for the
national anthem and again
uh I don't care what you think about it
and I'm not trying to convince you I'm
just saying that my personal standard
for respecting my government has been
surpassed yeah we're I can't respect
this government anymore now I got lots
of complaints about lots of things as we
all do the government gives you lots of
stuff to complain about but this is
different
um
yeah I know dude I understand the
government is not the country do you
 listen for a second huh like
some people are already flipping out
can you understand that I said
that directly before you did all right
so to disagree with me say something
that's different than what I
just said
right this guy's gonna turn it off oh
I'm done with you because you don't
understand the government is different
than the country just said that
I just said that
Jesus Christ
all right uh go off and be against uh
weed
uh legalization I think you're on that
team
all right um
do I seem to have an attitude today
I know I think it's going to get worse
Stay With Me
all right um
as long as the government is making
examples of conservatives I'm done with
the government speaking of the
government
um there's a national equipac poll that
gives the GOP a plus eight on a generic
ballot what that means is if a generic
Republican ran against a generic
Democrat which of course doesn't happen
in the real world the the Republican
would win solidly
now
um of course you know gerrymandering and
all that doesn't make that a real thing
but it does show you where the public is
at and according to quinnipact Biden
approval is only a 36 percent
as approval on the economy is 34 and do
I need to remind you it's the economy
stupid
if you're 34 on the economy you can't
get reelected and nobody good all right
but it doesn't matter he's not going to
run anyway
um however I should remind you I told
you that Rasmussen was plus 13 on a
similar question right
there's a pretty big difference plus 13
versus Plus 8.
but they're so they're both so solidly
in the same direction
that means something I should mention
that the erasmussen pole which has the
higher number 13 Point difference uh
they have classically done a better job
of taking a representative sample of
Voters
other polls tend to be Democrat heavy
for whatever reason
and so I would lean towards rasmus's
number of 13 as more credible than the
eight but they're both in the same
direction so they both say the same
thing
so the government will fall it appears
and it has to
has to
the government has to fall it is uh
disappointed
us greatly you want to hear some more
disappointment
uh I saw this in a tweet by Aaron and I
can't say his last name
who has a last name that I can't say in
public
and do you know why
it's a last name that I can't say in
public
that was
um
I can't say it because the last name is
spelled s-i-r-i
and if I say his last name it will
activate all your iPhones
so I can't say it
but
somebody named Aaron
with the last name that's a iPhone
digital assistant
he tweets this
um
that the FDA now this is the FDA is
asking this
this is it this is a key part of the
story the FDA is asking us
is asking a federal judge to Grant it
until the year 2076.
that's a long time from now to fully
release Pfizer's covid-19 vaccination
data
what
wait what I have to read that again the
fdas federal judge to Grant it until the
year 2076 to fully release Pfizer's
covid-19 vaccine data you
you
the FDA is corrupt obviously
if you had any doubt
you don't have any doubt now do you
uh I have said from the first and again
this was a personal opinion that you
that the benefit of a doubt or maybe the
presumption would be in favor of the
vaccines being safe
the presumption without without definite
knowledge
but my personal presumption
was that the vaccines were probably safe
enough
this changes my assumption
presumption it changes my presumption
I think this information you would have
to presume it's unsafe or less safe than
they're telling you let me be clear I'm
not going to say unsafe
that that would be too strong because
the evidence doesn't suggest that but it
does suggest that it's less safe than
reported
are you with me
why would they hide information if it's
good
can you think of any reason
well there are two reasons to hide
information uh well one one reason to
hide information if it's good
right the two reasons I had information
one is it's bad so you don't want people
to know
but the other is that it's not bad but
people might mistakenly think it is now
that's the case with Trump's tax returns
we don't know if Trump's tax returns
show something bad and I really doubt it
because you know it gets audited he's
got professionals doing stuff but
there's a hundred percent chance people
would think it was bad because it's
complicated and they don't understand
taxes there would be something there so
the good reason not to release good news
is that the good news can be
embarrassing because people will
misinterpret it
but that wouldn't be a problem until
2076.
you could just wait five years
you know if if the problem was you know
people to misinterpret the data just
wait two years right because then the
pandemic's mostly over five years to be
safe but if you make you know 50 plus
years to release this
you have to assume they're hiding bad
news
what else could you assume
you
now
I'm going to give them a little bit of
safety
it is entirely possible that the
government lied to you in what they
thought was your best interest
here would be an example of what that
would look like it could be that the
vaccines are more dangerous than has
been represented but you're still better
off country-wise getting them
not individually individually you know
all bets are off but it might be better
for the country even if they even if
everybody knew these were more dangerous
than reported
it's possible but
does your country your government have
the right
to lie to you for your own benefit they
could do it obviously they can do it get
away with it but do they have the right
to do that
no
no they don't they don't have that right
and for this the government should fall
the FDA needs the answer to this and if
they can't answer for it the government
needs to fall
this is a government-ending
thing right here if you lie to the
public this badly even for good
intention yeah and I don't know if it
was saying bad intention by anybody but
if you lie this badly the the government
has to be replaced
um and and by the way I have I have no
belief that things would have been
different under Trump because it's the
FDA right it's not really the president
who's doing anything on this I don't
think not yet
so this probably would have been the
same the FDA probably would have acted
the same under Trump this isn't even
political
um
next topic U.S has reached 100 000
deaths from overdoses
75 percent of them are some big numbers
from Fentanyl
now that's the way the news is reported
but of course the news is reported
incorrectly
here's a way to correctly report this
story
uh the real story is China worked with
Mexican cartels to murder over 60 000
Americans just this year
and our government did almost nothing
about it
again
now when I say again
I mean Trump did almost nothing about it
I mean he was catching stuff at the
border a little more aggressively maybe
I don't know uh and he talked to China
and China did nothing so that's as close
to nothing as you can get
I I give Trump a a failing grade on
Sentinel and I give Biden the failing
great as well
but I give the news an extra failing
grade because they're not even reporting
the story right the story is
China is murdering sixty thousand
 Americans a year through the
through the cartels they send the drugs
to the cartels to get into this country
and our government isn't doing a
thing about it
that's the story the story is we're
being murdered by tens of thousands and
our government isn't doing a
thing about it the government
has to fall
the government
has to fall
unjust this topic and by the way I would
say the same thing about Trump I think
if we had gone this long and Trump
hadn't done a thing about
fentanyl I'd want him replaced too
just to be clear no politics involved
here no politics I don't care who it is
if you can't get this done or at least
try hard
 you
um
what do we do about drug overdoses well
it turns out that there's an uh a very
clear way to solve it because the
Netherlands assault it and other
countries have too
so this big old drug problem that we're
wrestling with it does have a known
solution
basically you arrest the people who are
doing drugs in the streets or addicts
basically you force them into rehab you
give them a choice of jail or rehab
which basically forces them into rehab
and it works so you keep arresting the
dealers
but the people get rehab it's just
forced
now apparently forced rehab works just
as well as voluntary did you know that
right rehab isn't really a perfect
process it's not very good at all
actually but it's the best we have
um and it doesn't matter if you're
forced into it or you do it voluntarily
apparently you get about the same same
level of success
all right
so given that as Michael schellenberger
is doing uh at this point he's just a
National Treasure because the two two of
our biggest problems in the world
climate change he's behind the uh the
push for nuclear energy and now the drug
overdose problem and the homelessness
and all that he's taking that on and it
turns out that these are problems with
Solutions
I mean think about this we have lots of
problems where you can't really know
what the solution is like inflation
I don't know exactly what to do about
that I mean we could stop wildly
spending but but once it's here and
we've already done the wild spending
what do you do about it so there's lots
of problems that we don't know what to
do about them but this isn't one of them
climate change is not a problem we don't
know what to do about it we do nuclear
energy
this overdose problem is not a problem
that we don't know what to do about it
we do we know exactly what to do about
it because other countries have handled
it with great success we just do what
they do and there's no reason to think
that our culture or you know our our
situation our society would have a
different outcome at all
it once you know what the solutions are
I mean they're just basic stuff
well
so here's my take on China so they've
got a one-two punch going on here so
they send fentanyl to kill liberals
mostly all right now that's a gross
generalization there are plenty of
conservatives who died from Fentanyl but
it's probably concentrated a little bit
more on the left now who would normally
protects the people on the left in this
country
the people on the right
right it's usually the conservatives who
are backing you know strong police
forces strong defense you know
protection basically but the
conservatives are not protecting the
people on the left who are dying by tens
of thousands why not
why not
why is why is this the exception
I mean generally we have a country where
the conservatives are protecting
liberals from killing themselves one way
or another
but why not this time
it's because our press
is preventing it because the Press
decides what we think right that The
public's opinion and what we we do is
based on the media so to me it looks
like China has uh neutered the
conservatives because they somehow can
control the media and uh and once the
conservatives are off the field they can
just murder the Liberals because there's
nobody there to protect them
that's what it looks like to me
they just they just neuter the
conservatives with the media and murder
the Liberals with fentanyl
um
apparently and I this is an unconfirmed
report so put this in the category of
things I saw acclaimed on on Twitter I
would need a confirmation on this one
but apparently the according to the
story uh China is paying influencers in
this country to run a video that says
covet came from the U.S from a
white-tailed deer
uh that's what China is doing right now
they're pushing propaganda in this
country in this country paying
influencers another's influencer said no
turned them down
um
but they're pushing the idea that came
from the white-tailed deer
okay
um here's a little bit more on China did
you know that uh China I think it's the
top female player
from China
she was a whistleblower and said some
powerful
Chinese Communist guy sexually molested
or I don't know the details of that but
then she disappeared
that's right
I hope I'm pronouncing that right she
disappeared and nobody knows where she
is but they've seen one uh screenshot
oh yes I'm I'm I should note that there
are lots of conservatives and let's say
rural Kentucky who have uh drug problems
but the the fentanyl part of their drug
problem is accidental as it is for most
people actually
there are people who do it intentionally
um
but the overdoses are usually the
unintentional guys
so this Chinese tennis player was
sexually abused or raped I think that is
her claim and then the Chinese
government disappeared her
now Rose McGowan uh tweeted on this
and
um you know Rose McGowan got the metoo
movement going in this country
and
this is a bigger story than maybe you
think
because first of all it seems very clear
what happened that the Chinese
government probably raped a tennis star
she talked about it and then there
imprisoning her
for just talking about it
that probably
is what's happening and we're not going
to get any confirmation or denial that
is credible so we're never going to know
what's happening and I don't think we'll
ever see her again
I I think she's done
now
up until now I have an opinion that
China has mostly pissed off the men in
the United States I can't prove that
but when I hear people talking about
China it's almost always men
am I wrong about that
give me a fact Jack am I just being a
biased sexist
or would you agree that when anybody's
complaining about China attacking the
United States
95 percent of the time it's a man am I
right
now I'm not saying that there aren't
plenty of women who see the same things
of course there are
but isn't it like 95 male
I'm just looking at your comments to see
if I'm way off base here
it's disproportionate at the very light
right
disproportionate wouldn't you say
all right so here's what may have
happened with this feng shui tennis star
disappearing
this might activate American women
in a way that they have not been
activated against China
it's basically a rape regime
um what do you think is happening to the
uyghurs right now
do you think the uyghurs are getting
raped by the guards
I would guess yes
I would guess yes I would guess that
state sanctioned rape is probably a
thing
it probably is a thing I would bet that
the Chinese Communist Party does a lot
of raping
anybody want to bet against that anyone
does anyone want to bet
that the the high members of the Chinese
Communist Party are raping like crazy
you know they are
it's a rapist regime and
right there's there's nobody who's going
to doubt that right there's no pushback
on that is there
you know the you know they're raping
like crazy just because they can there's
nothing that would stop them and
unfortunately human nature blah blah
um so I wonder if uh activating the
women in this country if that happens
maybe women will ignore this too I don't
know but Rose McGowan's on it and that
means something
we know she can influence the country
maybe she'll do it again
um
so it does look like the uh
the Biden
regime has turned on the country
um
and in a way that's hard to explain but
they will be removed from Power pretty
soon
all right
um
I saw a tweet from uh Machiavelli's
underbelly
so that's just the name he uses for his
account and he said this he said I've
been watching behavioral Evolution
lectures for a few months now and my
primary takeaways are at number one
nothing close to Free Will could
possibly make any sense
number two nothing we do is rational but
is almost always fit I think he means
Works to Keep Us Alive
and we're more complex than however
complex you think you are all right I
agree with all these things but what's
interesting is that the way he got there
is by watching behavioral Evolution
lectures for months
and what he's done whether he thought
there can't be anything like free will
it doesn't make sense
get there a different way
the way hypnotist gets there is without
all the science
we just do stuff that makes it clear to
us that people don't have free will
because you can change people's
preferences
and then they act differently like where
was the free will if I could change it
if it gets changed by exterior things
and there doesn't seem to be a
processing level
two hypnotists this was always obvious
but science takes a while to catch up
all right let's talk about the
Rittenhouse trial is there any result
yet in the writtenhouse trial I haven't
seen anything in the comments so I'm
guessing no are the jurors still out
so they stayed out again I would like to
say that I support the jurors who want
to hold out and I'm going to go further
than this
because we know at this point that the
judge and the jury are mostly concerned
about public reaction would you agree
with that assumption first of all that
both the judge
and the jury at this point
given that we know there's no evidence
of a crime would everybody agree with
that
both the jury and the judge are
completely aware there's no evidence of
a crime we all know that now because we
saw the trial
at this point
do you know what would the best thing to
do would be
for the judge
to declare
I don't know what the legal term would
be
but just to cancel the trial
here's why
if I were the judge I would simply make
this statement
we have a we have this trial
and the jurors are justifiably concerned
for their safety
and that matters
because we're going to protect the
system
we're going to protect the system the
legal system and when you have a
situation where the jurors are afraid
for their lives you can't have a verdict
you can't do it and further
says there is no evidence of any crime
that was presented in the trial I as a
judge I'm just going to cancel it
not a mistrial not a mistrial with
prejudice that's too weak
just call it a nothing
don't call it a hung jury
don't even call it a mistrial
just say we're done
just say we're done I'll go home
there's no evidence of a crime everybody
go home
tell me that wouldn't work
wouldn't it
what would be more powerful see my
problem is that if there's a mistrial
people are going to read it as a
technicality
and they're going to think he was really
guilty
am I wrong
that a mistrial would make some
percentage of the country think
that he was actually guilty but got away
with it
but if the judge said there was no
evidence of a crime
and we're worried for we're worried for
our lives which they should be we're
just going to go home
because there was no evidence of a crime
there's nothing to do here
what do you think
because that would that would just rock
the whole country wouldn't it
because there's no name for that
like it's not a mistrial it's not a hung
jury
is what
it doesn't have a name that's why it
would be brilliant
oh is this dismissed
is that a thing you saw I'm so ignorant
of the law that
summary dismissal
would that cover what I'm saying
summary dismissal
met up
summary dismissal that might be exactly
the thing right
summary I guess that just means it's so
Wiki case it's ridiculous right
somebody's going to paste the
um summary dismissal
um
well I see it in the context of a job
all right I only seen an employment
what is summary dismissal by a lawyer
okay
it would be responsive motion for
summary judgments
uh jury nullification now I wouldn't
call it jury nullification
a directed verdict yeah maybe
that would that would be ballsy wouldn't
it imagine the judge I don't know the
legal details with us even possible
but imagine him just doing a directed
verdict and say you know
I didn't see any evidence of the crime
and I don't want the jurors to
get for this I'm a judge I'll take the
hit for it dismissed
dismissed for lack of evidence so that's
a thing right just dismissed for lack of
evidence that would be the best I feel
like that would be the best outcome
don't you
uh
dismissed okay now if it's dismissed it
could still be tried again I think
that's that's the the problem but since
there was no evidence I don't know that
it would be
um here's your lesson on cognitive
dissonance for the day courtesy of senk
uh
how do you say senk from The Young Turks
how do you pronounce his last name
because I hate I hate to botch people's
names because it sounds like I'm you
know being disrespectful
oh it's Jank
it's not a sink oh it's Jake okay well I
got his first name wrong uh Jank
uh ogre or uyghur
uh Jank Uber okay
all right with all due respect to Jake I
did not mean to get his name wrong
um and I think I've said his name wrong
a bunch of times in the past so I
apologize
well here's your lesson in cognitive
dissonance so I I think The Young Turks
were maybe uh anti-written house when it
all started but they watched the trial
and at least two of them
um jenk and Anna have decided that they
saw self-defense
so my first statement is
um good job
Jake and Anna for changing your opinions
based on evidence
that's I'm always impressed when people
change their opinion Based on data
based on evidence because you think it's
never going to happen right but then
what happens you're like oh somebody
actually changed their mind Based on
data well that's not exactly what
happened with jenk
um what he said in his tweet is that
yeah he sees uh he sees the defense of
self-defense being valid in this case
but he still thinks that Rittenhouse uh
is not an angel in the sense that he
quote came there and this is a quote
from Jack in hopes he could shoot
someone
what where is that in evidence
where's the evidence that Rittenhouse
came there in hopes he could shoot
someone
if you come if you come with a medical
kit
and you're you stated to everybody that
you're going to be defending some
property you're cleaning graffiti
which part of that indicates to jenk
that he came with the hopes to shoot
someone
that seems like quite the opposite of
all the evidence isn't it now again no
matter how much evidence there is I
can't read his mind to any more than
Jenkins so I'm not going to read
writtenhouse's mind and say oh I see in
there no bad intentions
I can't do that but the other thing I
can do is I looked into his mind and
although all of his actions looked
opposite I can see that what he's
secretly thinking is he'd like to shoot
somebody
that's cognitive dissonance
if you have to rely on mind reading in
public
your argument is gone but you can't
release it yet so so you sort of shift
it to something that's you know adjacent
to your argument that you can hold on to
but there wasn't anything adjacent to
his argument he could hold on to either
so he didn't get anything he just gotta
got a whiff
just shot the miss
all right
so the bottom line here is that our
government has turned against the people
is not defending us against China
whatsoever
they're now helping us with fentanyl at
all
now helping us protect the Border at all
and they're putting Americans in jail to
make an example
to make an example
as soon as you hear that any American is
being put in jail for to make an example
you should be done with your government
because we don't do that that's not the
America I will stand for now again I get
I get the distinction in the government
versus the people I love the people
right so I'm very
pro-american people
and I'm still Pro completely Pro the
Republic
so I like the Republic
I like the people I think you know
America has done great things and will
do more great things
but the government current government
has to fail
they have to fall
because they've gone too far and
everybody can see it now all right you
can see from the the poll results
everybody can see it it's it's now
really obvious uh Americans are being
hunted just to make a political Point
can't live in that country
so that's not going to stand we won't
have that we will not be Australia the
Second Amendment exists for a reason
this is it now I'm not saying use guns
of course I'm saying that the government
ultimately is going to do what you tell
it to do
why because the Second Amendment
I mean not entirely because of that you
know they want to keep their jobs and
get good ratings and all that stuff too
but the people have complete power in
this country we're not Australia
in Australia the government has power
over the people
not here
not here not ever
not here not ever
in America the people control the
government and it's time
to exert that control now probably it'll
just be the 2022 election
could be you know protests or something
but we you know we have mechanisms in
place
but now it's time
now if you think that I'm telling you
you should elect Trump
I'm not
I'm not I'd like to see who's running
if you think that I will uncritically
support Trump if he gets into the race
you're wrong
because if DeSantis is in the race I'm
probably going to back him
sorry
now if uh if Trump wins the primary I
probably will back him
but Republicans you need to get your
house in order what you want to do I'm
not a republican I won't advise you
but I'm just saying DeSantis is looking
really strong
uh Trump is stronger
on a lot of things I think but also
brings some controversy and he's also of
a certain age and you know
maybe change is is necessary
on the other hand Trump is probably the
only personality who can do some of the
things that need to get done
like he can go further against China for
example I think
then maybe somebody else could so Trump
is a big big benefits and but also big
costs
and I've always said he's an expensive
president but you get your uh
but you get your money's worth
uh Trump's a better story that's correct
yeah if you do the prediction that the
better story always wins it's definitely
a trump comeback
definitely now I could definitely
support Trump
from the get-go if you know if I thought
maybe he'd changed some of his uh some
of his approach or change his priorities
or something I I could I could be
convinced
but not right now
um
yeah what if Trump pivots to the the
Kinder nicer lame duck version of
himself now here's another thing do you
want to elect a a lame duck president
from the start
and I don't know that sounded rhetorical
but I don't know the answer because
um normally the second term of a
president can be a little dicey because
everybody knows they're on the way out
if Trump is elected it's the second term
so he's a certain age and he's
sort of you know on the way out DeSantis
would be a first term president with
another term to go
so if you wanted to hold power
for longer DeSantis is a better vote a
better bet
because Trump could easily turn the
country you know slip the Congress back
the other direction just because people
get worked up about him
no way in hell would I vote for Scott
am I running
better to have Trump as vice president
now that
uh if you want Trump to have a a third
term
just vote for somebody who will do
whatever Trump tells them to do
you could get it that way
uh can you talk about the grocery
industry is corrupt I'll give you one
example when I had my product it got
placed into
7-Elevens which is a gigantic
you know break for a new food company we
actually got a shelf space on 7-Elevens
and then when we went to check to see
how it was doing we couldn't find it
anywhere on the Shelf
oh it was there
but uh the other food companies craft in
particular they have people on the
ground who will come in and put their
product in front of your product if it's
a competing product so that's a known
thing it's called burying it on the
Shelf
so the the food business is and then
Safeway all name names Safeway is
essentially a uh a fraudulent operation
uh with the way they treat the the
vendors who provide food so they'll sell
you some space on the bottom
shelf and when I say sell it to you I
mean they'll they make you pay to be in
the store
and then after you've paid as much as
you're going to pay they say well there
was another fee
you say well we didn't negotiate any
other fee we've paid everything we're
going to pay to be on the Shelf they say
well you know you don't have to but
we'll take you off the shelf you say
okay okay okay I'll pay this extra fee
just keep us on the Shelf
and then next month they give you
another extra fee
and you say wait a minute
this is now an extra fee on top of an
extra fee none of this was ever
discussed
and they say you don't have to pay it
you could just be off the shelf
so yeah
um Safeway craft those are corrupt
corporations and they're they run a
corrupt business and the the food
industry in general is like that
actually
um
all right I need to run
um I can't stay long today and I'll talk
to you tomorrow
