Papa
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
sometimes with proper lighting there we
go just right
if you'd like to take this experience
which is going to be amazing just by
itself but if you want to take this to
levels that nobody's ever understood or
heard or it could even speak of there's
no words to explain it all you need is a
cup or a mug or a glass of tanker tells
us either canteen jug of flaska vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine into the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now
go
ah you did that well
I think that was your best SIP
good job
well I don't know where to begin there's
so many weird and interesting stories
today that I didn't even get to check
the news
and I'll talk about that the news
without the news
all right well I like to start with
interesting stories before we get to the
big meet but so there's a tour group
that gives tours of San Francisco
how would you like to be a tour group
or how would you like to be a business
whose job it was to give tours of San
Francisco well apparently they're
capitalizing on the situation and
they're now giving a tour that they call
the Doom Loop walking tour
and it's a tongue-in-cheek ad but it
says uh you've read the headlines you've
seen the tweets now get close and
personal to the doom and squalor of
downtown San Francisco
oh
just discover the policy choices that
made America's wealthiest city the
nation's Innovative leader of housing
crisis addiction
so apparently here's the funny part the
tours are booked
they're fully booked
there's all these people who want to see
the Doom Loop of a city in complete
disarray and decline
now if there's one thing I love about
America there's more than one thing
but one thing I love about America is
that we've never heard of a problem we
can't make money on
you name it
if something's going wrong there's one
of us bastards who's figuring out how to
make a buck on it and I'm sure that
that's what keeps the entire system
working
is that the dumbest most unproductive
things in the world can be going on and
somebody's going to be sitting off you
know just off the sideline saying I
think I can make this work
I think I can build a business model
around this
free market for the win
speaking of the free market Elon Musk
tweeted
uh that he actually put newspapers in
quote he goes newspapers
just search the internet particularly
this platform and print it out
wow
you know
there used to be a good reason to read
newspapers
does anybody remember when newspapers
had a comic called what was it called it
was called Dilbert Dilbert it used to be
in these paper things called newspapers
and they would be sent to people like
physically to their homes and stuff and
then they would try to read them and
they would get like their hands would be
filled with all kind of weird ink and
crap and after you read it you couldn't
talk you couldn't touch your food
do you ever try to read a newspaper and
eat toast at the same time
no you can't do it because your your
toast is going to taste like newspaper
ink right
I might have a bad attitude about
newspapers at the moment
I might have a little bias
a little bit
the the funniest question I get from
trolls online
is that the trolls like to come into my
tweets and say something about how sad I
must be that I got canceled by
newspapers
um
who would want to be associated with
newspapers
can you raise your hand is there anybody
here who have ever gone on a date and
lied that you worked on the newspaper
business try to impress your date it's
like I don't want her to hear that I'm a
quality assurance person at a big
Corporation I'm going to make up a some
kind of sexy job
astronaut no no she'd catch me uh
newspaper reporter newspaper writer yeah
yeah because you'd like you'd like to
feel good about yourself
because you work for a newspaper
um
well I was also watching some YouTube
clips
from Peter Zayn my God that guy's
interesting now I do not know if Peter
Zan has you know amazingly good insights
about everything geopolitical
or not
I mean I really can't tell what's true
and what's not but I'll tell you his
content is interesting from beginning to
end
so you know use your use your adult
filters to you know put yourself in the
head of nobody knows the future
can we agree that nobody knows the
future
but he says interesting things I'm going
to share a few with you
and first of all I need a fact check on
this because as Elon Musk says the
newspapers
but also the regular news they don't
have regular news Gathering
assets so they're trying to sell opinion
as news
so when actual news drops sometimes you
can't find it anywhere
because it's not opinion it's actual
news
but can you give me a confirmation I so
I haven't seen this in any news
so-called news
that we're working on to deal with Iran
and that is looking good
have you heard that
I can't even tell if it was a new video
but why did why did I completely missed
that in reading the news every single
day several times a day and I never saw
it
well
um I don't know why I guess it's because
as Elon Musk says the newspapers are not
real news and the regular news isn't
real news and by the way that was
another thing that Peter Zeon described
he described the evolution from having
robust news bureaus in other countries
to what we have now which is uh people
writing opinions and then other people
writing opinions about the other
people's opinions and we're selling it
as news because it comes out on the
Legacy platforms that you used to think
were news
so you it makes you think that news is
happening but there hasn't been news in
a long time
and news went away a long time ago it's
just opinions about opinions
um so anyway the but if Peter Zan is
correct
um it would look like the broad Strokes
of the deal would have something about
the U.S having or the International
Community the U.N having more access to
checking out Iran's nuclear situation
and apparently they're going to agree to
that and one of the surprises is now
this is from Peter Zan one of the
surprises is when Iran recently was
reinspected is that that uranium that
they were processing up to nuclear grade
they actually started going in the other
direction
they took half of what they had up to
like 90 percent and half of it they've
already downgraded it to is it
enrichment is the right word so they've
uh they've unenriched it if that's the
thing so it's less likely to become a
weapon
so it's beginning to look like Iran
either didn't need that much or maybe
they weren't so dead set on building a
nuclear weapon
I guess part of the deal is they would
allow more inspections uh they would
give six billion dollars of their own
money back or somebody else's money it
wasn't our money but the the the
background on this
is that the Russian sanctions
in an indirect way that he can explain
but I can't at the moment in an indirect
way it hurt Iran so Iran apparently is
just dying for cash they're just broke
and so Biden may have accidentally done
more harm to Iran's economy than Trump
did
but not because he was trying but
because he you know the Ukraine war
had had a side impact on Iran which is
pretty devastating
so that made an opportunity for a deal
because Iran was more desperate than
they have been now this is Peter's Ann
stake
I don't know you know I'm not there so I
don't have any counter claims to bounce
against it
but the idea is that Iran might be
flexible about nuclear stuff and here's
and if Zayn is right
um Benjamin Netanyahu
head of Israel
says that they're they're looking at a
deal that he can live with
so there might actually be something
going on
that's entirely positive for everybody
meaning that the Middle East would get
back into some kind of balance I believe
part of the deal is that Iran would stop
funding attacks against Saudi Arabia and
some of their neighbors
so you would get fewer funding less
funding of it of uh proxy attacks you
get we'd get some prisoners back I guess
some drug dealers were in prison
uh they would give six billion dollars
of their own or somebody else's money
that they had been held up but it wasn't
our money
and then we would get access to their
you know nuclear inspections
now the fact that maybe Netanyahu could
live with it
now put two things together
two things start with the uh Abraham
Accords
so the Abraham Accords got a lot of the
players on the same team at least
economically and on paper
but Iran was specifically carved out as
somebody you couldn't deal with at the
moment
but that caused the problem because Iran
is a funder of proxy wars and you know
they're the big problem over there
so it looks like we're heading toward
don't get too excited
but yeah the chatter is a Saudi Arabia
might be willing to recognize Israel
which I think might be a separate
conversation but I can easily see them
folded together
so Saudi Arabia might get relief from
the proxy wars
um is it the hutus and the whoever
so that we're attacking Saudi and Saudi
interests Yemen so so the Yemen thing
might get some relief at least in the
funding sense
relief meaning they're not funded to
attack anybody anymore
and that would create the hope would be
some balance in the Middle East
sufficient that we don't need to be
involved we the United States
and that might be amazing we might be
right on the cusp of two administrations
doing the right thing in one case maybe
a little bit accidentally but you know
taking advantage of it
we might be seeing something like a
gigantic
to administration because I think you'd
have to include both
two Administration
achievement that would be kind of
amazing
kind of amazing the hutus are rwanda's
okay I don't know my
assume everything I said about
that that area is wrong so it's the
Yemen
what are the two groups in Yemen
the two warring groups in Yemen are the
that the the who's and the who's
I'm in the wrong continent yeah I only
got the wrong continent but
the hoodies all right well somebody's
fighting over there anyway so that might
be good we'll see but the other thing
that Peter Zan said is that I hadn't
heard this before that the primary
reason for Russia's let's say
aggressiveness against his neighbors and
I'd never heard this before now you'd
always heard that it was you know maybe
defensive and maybe maybe he was
building up his Empire to get it back to
where it was but you know everything
that you hear in the United States
through the regular news about Russia
and Russia's intentions and Putin's
intentions that's all fake you know that
right
like anything about Putin's intentions
that's all Faith propaganda
right so you but Peter's Aion has a take
and it goes like this and I don't know
if I believe it
so I feel like
there's probably a lot more to it yeah
you've heard it's about warm water ports
here's his take
that the Topography of Russia and the
surrounding countries that are you know
between it in Europe proper
um the Topography is really
um disadvantageous for defense meaning
that if somebody were to attack Russia
prior to Russia being aggressive and you
know taking Crimea and Georgia and all
those things there were some easy attack
points
that the homeland of Russia would be
vulnerable to but in the old days under
the Soviet Union they had controlled
enough territory that they could control
choke points
so there are some choke points that if
you control them militarily it would be
very difficult for an army to attack
Russia
if you don't attack them apparently it's
kind of easy on the ground now so the
thinking is that even if Putin left
tomorrow
the the other senior people who were you
know his people would have exactly the
same policy because they all see us as
an existential risk to Russia whether
soon or in the next thousand years in
other words they're looking for a
permanent security situation for Russia
now have you ever seen that reported in
regular news
I read a lot of news about Ukraine
I've never seen that before have you how
many of you have never heard that before
other from Peter Zam
so some of you have you know a lot of
you have interesting
all right well good for you you know
I've said this a lot this is the I think
the most informed
and smartest audience in politics
because you actually are engaged in
trying to figure out how to figure out
which is way more important than
figuring out what the news said
you know this is a group of people who
are very actively trying to figure out
how are they lying to us and if they are
lying how can we figure it out and
wanted to tell us for lying and stuff
so well so I'm impressed I'm impressed
that that's such a basic thing that you
should need to know about the Ukraine
war now here's the part that I'm going
to disagree with Peter Zan
he says that the war can't end unless
one of them just has a convincing
Victory and that you know that's
unlikely
so that if Ukraine doesn't have a right
win and pretty much you know demolish
Russia as a as a major power
uh or or Putin somehow magically win if
that doesn't happen the war will just go
on forever
but I but what I hear is the opposite
what I hear if it's true that their
primary interest is the choke points
how could you not have a way to
negotiate that
that feels like the easiest thing to
negotiate now that doesn't mean you
necessarily say oh these choke points
can belong to you
but it definitely tells you that if
you've got something called NATO
don't expect them to give up on the
choke points
I mean you'd have to look at the whole
situation right like how about the whole
uh trade economic situation how about uh
the entire Russia Russia China
connection you'd want to loosen that and
maybe maybe get Russia into the European
or American domain a little bit more
so to me the fact that we understand
what the Russians want or at least I do
maybe for the first time I understand
that element
that usually gives you something to
negotiate that the times when you can't
negotiate is when two sides want the
same thing
and there's only one of the same thing
this is a situation where Russia wants
something unique to Russia
and other people want you know their own
things like their own security
Etc but they're different things
and I would say as a general uh
negotiation fact that when people want
the same one thing you've got a problem
okay you know that statue I own that no
I own it where are you gonna go with
that right you can't have half a statue
but if you've got a situation where what
the Russians need is a specific
Geographic or defensive power there's
probably a number of ways to get to that
and it's Unique to them so in other
words you don't have to give up
something of your own too much
necessarily
to give them what they want and that
that usually suggests a deal could be
made so I still think he could
all right
RFK Jr said too the most surprising
things you'll ever hear from a Democrat
number one Trump was right he was wrong
the wall is needed
boom now when he says carefully I don't
mean physically a wall the whole way but
also Trump didn't really mean that
either he means whatever whatever it
takes to close the border
he calls the Border completely open
and he tells a story that's associated
with his documentary he did he spends he
spent a lot of time interviewing people
there and I heard a story from him this
was on Tucker's interview
I heard a story from RFK Jr that I'd
never heard
apparently the we always do the cartels
or managing the illegal flow of
immigration we didn't know well I didn't
know so again this might be something
you already knew I didn't know that
their operation the cartel operation had
spread globally
to the point where almost all of the
immigrants
are not from Central America or Mexico
almost all of them are from Africa
everywhere else China
and he pointed out that the vast
majority of the of them are military age
men but he's not saying he's not saying
it's a military operation
he's just saying that's if you were to
look at him that that would be the
description the young men but they're
coming from you know Africa they're
coming from China they're coming from
any place they can get out of
now and apparently this system is built
to look like we have a system but it's a
fake system it's really designed to let
everybody in
and here's what that means
if you come in the let's say the legal
way where the government is you know
checking your fingerprints and giving
you a court date
your court date is in seven years
you have seven years to live in this
country
completely legally now you're not a
citizen but you're you're completely
legal because you've checked in
do you think that in seven years they're
going to be sent back do you think
there's a court in America as seven
years from now who's going to say well
you've been living and working here for
seven years and you've committed no
crimes let's say
do you think that we're going to send
them back
of course not no we do have an open
border
and even RFK Jr a Democrat says it
clearly this is an open border and he's
basically saying that the news has been
kept from you
not only has the news been kept from us
but even from the right I would say that
I have not seen any right-leaning
publication
and that might be on me I mean it
probably is in Breitbart actually
breitbart's good on the border so
Breitbart probably has covered this but
I haven't seen it on Fox news that 98 of
the people coming in are not from
Central and South America
and uh Kamala Harris says that all
worked out right
so Cobble Harris is working on Central
America and that's not even the problem
that it doesn't look like incompetence
does it would you agree that whatever is
going on it doesn't look like
incompetence it looks like some kind of
a
very determined effort to just let
everybody in
and it's hard for me to imagine what the
positive outcome of that is because the
cities are gone the cities are destroyed
yeah are you telling me the Democrats
were trying to destroy the Democrat
cities by letting in or is it only
because the Republican Governors you
know cleverly shipped their people to
the the blue cities and thwarted their
plan I don't know what's going on
like to to me it doesn't look like a
clever plan
like I I don't see the the clever way
that the Democrats are using immigration
as a as a secret tool to accomplish
their what do they really think they're
going to get extra votes
I don't think so
I I think that these immigrants are
being shipped into cities where they're
being shipped into you know the filth
and crime that they were trying to
escape and they're probably probably
saying to themselves the same thing
everybody else is what can we do about
this because I would like less crime and
filth in my own City where I'm living
for seven years at least and they're
probably going to say is there anybody
who's offering to take care of it
you know like a republican for example
uh I don't know I would definitely vote
I would bet against
immigration turning the country uh more
liberal
do you think let me uh let me do a
mental uh just a mental test for you
imagine a bus load the cartels got a
busload of immigrants and they've been
taken from everywhere from China to
Africa to I guess
um you know Eastern Europe or something
um so they're all over the place if you
were to do a survey of the let's say
attitudes or philosophies of the people
on that bus
how many are conservative and how many
are liberal
on the on the generic immigrant bus
remember people they're not French
they're not French
they're not British they're not
Australian
they're not woke
my guess is they're they're they're
bringing busloads of unwoke people into
the country
now that doesn't mean that they you know
register as a republican but I think
from a social perspective they're
bringing in way more conservative people
than their own base
am I wrong
given that it's you know the specific
collection of people from all over the
world do you think the Africans
are are liberal
you think Africans are liberal I mean in
some senses of course you know certainly
racially they would be
I mean at least at least at least they
wouldn't want to discrimination against
themselves
well I don't know so I don't understand
why the border is open because I don't
see the play it doesn't look like simple
incompetence it looks like a plan
but the only way it makes sense to me is
what's the only way it makes it there
you go
the only way it makes sense is if China
or one of our adversaries is has bribed
the president to go easy on the border
I mean to me it looks like there's some
outside force
because there's nothing in the news that
would explain what we're seeing
it would have to be an external force or
it could be an internal Force but one
that's not reported or we don't see it's
invisible somehow there's some outside
force that causes the Biden
Administration which means Biden himself
would you agree that Biden himself is
the person in charge of whether it's
open or closed
that doesn't stop anywhere else right
now of course you delegate stuff well no
but but in terms of on paper he's the
one in charge of the Border
not commonly
all right so that was kind of a shocker
to find that RFK Jr is not only a close
the border Democrat he's more closed the
Border than any Republican I've ever
seen
it is more close the border than any
Republican I've ever seen because she's
got better reasons he's coming at it
with facts he did his own research he
went there himself he interviewed
busloads of people individually he
actually understands the whole situation
and if you want if you want me to finish
this conversation it goes like this
the cartels when families come through
they remove the young and attractive
traffickable women
and then they send the rest of the
family on their way
that's right they'll take your sister
and your wife
turn them into prostitutes
and send you on your way to America
now RFK Jr explains that you know I mean
this is a well-known understood
phenomenon and you talk to families that
had a member taken away to be trafficked
and traffic by the way would be the good
news that would be the best outcome the
bad news is raped to death right right
there while you're you know 100 yards
away
so that's what's happening on our border
and that's what the Biden Administration
and Biden himself is specifically
allowing
because they're you know quite aware of
it but they're allowing it
here's the big second big change RFK JR
says that when he talks about uh
the environment he rarely talks about
climate and climate change risk do you
know what reason he gave
for why he doesn't talk about climate
change risk but rather he tries to talk
about the things where everybody would
agree which is better water better air
and moving toward energy this less
polluting in general
do you know why he says he's not talking
climate change risk
doesn't believe scientists and doesn't
believe the model
thank you
you know how long how long have people
been telling me Scott why do you keep
saying that RFK JR says some good things
that you like
when you know he's like a climate change
crazy guy and he's always been a climate
change crazy guy
well I could not believe that everything
else RFK Jr said about the experts
didn't apply to climate scientists
right because he's not coming across as
a partisan he is coming across right or
wrong like maybe some of his ideas are
terrific maybe some of them are terrible
I don't know I'm not the one really to
judge them all but I know he's not being
partisan I know he's not just playing
for a team
and his skepticism about scientists who
were you know paid for their opinions
basically his skepticism does apply to
climate change models
exactly
as you think it should have
am I wrong
isn't everything that RFK Jr has said
about Pharma big food
you know big companies polluting
is it and you know the CIA I mean isn't
everything he says consistent with not
believing the uh the scientific climate
change models it is that is 100
consistent he's telling you the entire
system is corrupt
and so he doesn't believe any of the
corruptor parts
that's pretty good
now somebody said to me but Scott he
said he wants to get rid of coal and oil
do you think that's true
do you think it's true the RFK wants to
get rid of coal and oil
the answer is incomplete
incomplete yes he does yes he does want
to get rid of him do you know what he
wants to do to get rid of them
let the free market get rid of them
that's right he wants the free market
to properly price
all of our energy components so that one
of them is not accidentally subsidized
for no good purpose other than the
profits that they use subsidized
now I don't know if that's a good idea
sounds like it might be I mean it's very
much
could be I just don't know if the free
market is as efficient as you'd like it
to be or if we could get it there
but do you hate the fact that he's
anti-coal and anti-oil in only the sense
that it needs to compete fairly against
the Green energy and if it wins it wins
if it doesn't it doesn't
and if it wins for a while and then
doesn't that's the free market
but he's not worried about the climate
models and and the risk of bills being
killed he wants to breathe
and eat
and go to the doctor without getting
 up by
that's it
that's pretty reasonable now I'm not you
know I'm not endorsing him I'm just
saying that when you see somebody enter
the race in a non-partisan fashion and
look at like really really show complete
I would say complete credibility
in the way he talks about the issues you
don't have to agree with them but he's
definitely trying he's trying to include
the the evidence that one side always
likes to ignore
you know in both cases now that doesn't
make him your candidate right you may
disagree them on an abortion or
something else but
my God he's doing a good job and he's
doing a great job for the country
you know just helping us shape our
arguments and how we think about this
stuff I mean a great job if the only
thing RFK Jr did was create this uh
border documentary and inform us what's
really going on for the first time in my
case I think others might might have
known it
but that's a tremendous tremendous
benefit to the country that's that's
pure
good citizenship
now you know I I tell you if Vivek is
amazing every day and again he's created
some more videos where his take is the
best one he was talking about Taiwan
see if you don't think this is the
cleanest
take on Taiwan I'm not saying it's the
best
because I'm not sure any any solution is
perfect but he says that as long as
Taiwan uh is our Vital source of
microchips and we're not really that
close to replacing them he said as long
as that's true China is not going to
take Taiwan if he's president
just period it's just not going to
happen whatever it takes they're not
going to take Taiwan under these
circumstances but here's the nuance
he says once America you know recaptures
its ability to do Advanced microchips he
says that is a civil war and then he
after that you have to recalibrate
because at that point we would not have
a vital security interest
but until then he would he would float
you know maybe
destroyers or Crews whatever through the
Straits to make sure that China knows
that we're not going to give up our
microchips that's just not going to
happen
pretty good
pretty good I don't know if it's
complete
it's pretty good
you know for somebody whose message is
let's take care of ourselves
all right
I I've got a troll on here that's I feel
like the good trolls take the summer off
like it'll be till September until
somebody really trolls me good
but I'm getting the
uh the all caps trolls
I think the all caps drills are the ones
who who are even
disregarded by other trolls I think even
other trolls
like have a hierarchy of trolling it's
like ah
urinal cap stroll aren't you
I go for more of the emotional stuff
I'll try to find what people's what
somebody is saying politically
I'll try to say what they're saying
politically but then I'll go after them
for whatever personal tragedy they had
like that's a higher end troll but even
they don't like the all caps trolls it's
like you're making us look bad
you know I just said something about his
dead stepson and I think I nailed it and
then you made me look bad with your all
caps comment could you please take your
all caps
to the lower league of trolley and not
make us all look bad
all right here's a question for you
Rasmussen uh did a poll uh how many
people do you believe who are likely
voters
believe that as a vice presidential
running mate kamales Harris helps
Biden's chances in 2024. how many think
that it's that she helps his chance oh
yeah that's a pretty good guess is 22
percent
but your your guess of 25 was really
close
again I again the smartest audience ever
and I did note that many of you had the
answer before I asked the question and
you won't see that in the live streams
right you watch another live stream
usually it's like somebody will ask a
question and then they'll be the answer
because that's the the slower viewers
that's the way they do it's like I've
got to wait for the question oh here's
the answer so slow so old now my I my my
viewers give the answer before the
question and that's the way to do it
uh here's an update on my book you know
I've got a new book reframe your brain
because my publisher canceled me the
update is I am banned for life on Amazon
KDP now that's the service that
independent Publishers use to put books
on Amazon so to make it available now
the reason for Banning me for life is
that I don't own my own book
they say now I do own my book I own all
the rights I have all the documentation
I have the assignment documents which
have been provided to them from the from
the start
so from the start they had the document
showing my ownership
but when we say what's wrong with my
documents showing my ownership
they say
well we'll have to study this and get
back to you and then they study it and
they say you're still banned for life
and then I say yeah but like why is
there somebody you think owns it or do
you think that I'm not me
and they say banned for life confirmed
we'll get we'll five days we'll get a
look at it again
now it took me a while because these
were email email exchanges with the
support it took me a while to realize
I'm talking to an AI
I'm pretty sure the the responses didn't
have any tells for a human
now they were signed by a human name
so several of the messages had different
names there's Christopher and there's
somebody else but the message and two of
them came back identical
right so I know they weren't reading the
message now
I made sure that I wrote my message in a
way the last one that it would be
impossible
to ignore what I said and simply say
some canned response but I got a candid
response so it would have been
impossible for a human to ignore what I
said
so
I don't have any way to even figure it
out so we're going to look for
Alternatives and we'll see if we can
solve it now before you go all
conspiracy theory
there's no indication it's anything but
maybe a system problem
probably if I had to guess it's because
my old publisher
had some placeholders online for the
future book and maybe those are
confusing the system it's probably some
AI system that checks content to make
sure you check something to make sure
you own it
now it is not a conspiracy theory
don't think this is part of cancellation
now it is true that I was canceled in
newspapers primarily because the
Washington Post I think was the you know
the leading entity that canceled me and
then the other newspaper said oh if the
Washington Post does it we all have to
do it so the Washington Post is owned by
Jeff Bezos who's you know a notable
Democrat
um and he also owns Amazon which just
Banned Me For Life
so the two Jeff Bezos properties have
banned me for life to make it impossible
to you know be a public figure and earn
a living but
we're still we're going to still call
that a coincidence
all right
now here because the problem is he owns
he owns so many things that the odds of
running into him are pretty high right
the odds of running into a Bezos
something is pretty high so it doesn't
mean that he's behind anything uh
however if I were him I'd be deeply
embarrassed
imagine being the guy who owns Amazon
which is basically a you know a Bastion
of free speech you know maybe uh in my
opinion Amazon's one of the greatest
companies ever created you know Amazon
is more than just a company it's like
it's amazing you know that they do such
a good job at Amazon the software and
the technology that you forget
how many mistakes somebody could make
with this business the the fact that
they operate so well I mean it's not
perfect but they operate so well in an
amazing complex environment it's just
jaw-dropping every time I see it so I
think Amazon is one of the greatest
companies of all time I mean that's not
saying anything shocking
so great company
um and I don't think Jeff Bezos is
sitting around worrying about what Scott
does so I think it would be highly
unlikely
that he had made some personal decisions
in any way but if I were him I'd be
pretty embarrassed if my if two of my
major properties had Banned Me For Life
over
so
um
so that's where we are well I'm working
with Joshua lisac we'll work out the
business options we do apparently we
have some options so it's not like
they'll be banned and never be able to
put the book out it'll be available
somewhere somewhere
probably in the next week or two
probably the hard cover so far has not
been stopped because it's going to come
through a different path
but they might stop it that would be
consistent
so that's the update on that all right
uh Mike sirovich's warning of genocide
he says that the
the situation in the United States is
fitting a pattern of you know
polarization and demonization and you
know there's a pretty well known
pattern that gets you to genocide
um you know dehumanization uh let's say
by the media debanking we see we're
seeing that and then you'll prosecutions
that you think are
so every one of those things is
happening right now in the United States
does that mean we're going to have a
full breakdown of civilization
and people will be killing people in the
streets
I don't think so you know I actually
don't I just don't feel it I don't feel
it in the Zeitgeist at all I don't feel
it outside of social media and social
media doesn't have arms and legs
so
uh
I don't know I don't feel at all
but you know I don't spend around a lot
of time around people so do you yeah do
you feel in your real life in your real
life is anybody like cleaning their guns
and getting ready to go to war
when you say you feel it but do you feel
it in your daily life forget about
social media
forget about social media in your daily
life you feel like there's a Civil War
coming
I don't see anything like that
a lot of people say yes by the way but
uh my opinion is that you may be biased
by social media
to see it but although although some of
you probably have family members who are
so
who are so spoiled you even your own
family looks like a Civil War at this
point
all right
um so I'm going to be counter to that
but I think he makes a warning that you
should pay attention to which is this
stuff can get out of hand really quickly
so where he and I will agree completely
two places all the signs are there I
agree with that you know if you go down
the list all the signs are there and
number two
um
it can happen quickly
so you can say to yourself yeah yeah
it's got the signs are there but you
know we'd have lots of a warning before
it got that bad no no you wouldn't that
that's really important to know you
wouldn't have a lot of warning because
you have a lot of warning right now
so if you're telling yourself we'd have
lots of warning to correct this is the
warning
where's the correction
you're warned you couldn't be warned any
clearer than this
uh but as somebody else pointed out uh
what's it mean when the country is
heavily armed and the answer is we're
going to stay solid
because we're too heavily armed
yeah and we're the arming gives you a
little confidence and you can make you
can make the political system do what
you want eventually so I think we'll be
fine it could get worse before it gets
better but I don't think we're going to
full genocide
um
Trump apparently there they want to get
a trump mug shot but there's some I
think there's some possibility they
could make that go away because it's not
necessary for the most famous face in
the world the reason you do mug shots
I'm told
is in case somebody tries to escape the
law you've got a picture of them for
later
but if you're the most famous face in
the world
do you really need a mug shot where is
it going to hide
um
but this gives me the questions let's
let's I think maybe he won't do it but
if he does do it the biggest question I
have is does he go for the smile
or the powers there
right because you see this smile when he
poses for pictures
his smile isn't his best look I mean
it's good that he can smile but you know
he has sort of a smile for the camera's
look that's not ideal
you know what I mean the I'm smiling
because I'm on camera look that's not
your best smile
but you know you do what you can if
you're a politician you you gotta you
gotta show the teeth right
uh but he has a Powers there
that's killer wouldn't you say the power
stair I don't know if I can do it but it
builds something like this
you know the the dad's coming home stare
the one I want to see is the dad coming
home stare the the one that says
just wait
just wait that's the one I want to see
and as uh sticks and Hammer said it's
going to be the most memed image of all
time
nothing will be more memed than his mug
shot so I say
do the mug shot
do the mug shot his his base is waiting
like we're all like they're waiting at
their computers
do it do it do it do it
all right
uh Trump
all right Trump does a video in which
he's claiming the election was rigged
and he's calling the people who did it
riggers
how how long did it take
for somebody in social media to say
riggers wait a minute
is this another one of those uh racist
things he's saying without saying it is
this is this racist Mafia talk
does he really mean the n-word but he's
using the r word to try to beat it in
some kind of a clever workaround
no do you think he's calling people who
do elections the n-word
no
but do you think that do you think it
ever crossed his mind that it would make
a lot of trouble if he used the word
Maybe
maybe which would be freaking hilarious
it would be hilarious
so Riga please anyway
um in my opinion
reality is already starting to bend
right the reality that we're told is
reality that is that the election was
clean and the way that you know the
election was clean is that they didn't
find any problems
and half of the country thinks that
makes sense
all right let me say it again so we can
laugh at half of the country half of the
country will say this on you on social
media in public
like they think it makes sense and that
you're done for not understanding
here's what they say
the elections were definitely clean
because there's no publicly known
information that would refute that
it's 2023 and people will say that in
public
and they'll think well this is a smart
take the smart take is that they didn't
find any problems so therefore it's
clean
now I don't need to even say anything
about that do I
imagine that imagine that
stop it
stop it
[Laughter]
I'm not even going to read that comment
stop it
just stop it
all right I'll tell you about it later
I'll tell you I'll tell you about it
during the man cave it was it was too
inappropriate for public but it was
funny
all right let's not insult anybody if we
don't need to
unless they have it coming
um
so I lost my train of thought that was
just too funny all right train of
thought back online stop it stop it
um
you're terrible
stop it
um
so here's what I think
I can almost feel
the simulation changing
now of course this is just you know a
mental phenomenon I'm not I'm not saying
we're necessarily in the simulation but
it seems like it
and and here's here's what the
simulation requires it requires Trump to
be in the greatest legal Jeopardy
whatever that looks like looks like
we're approaching it the greatest legal
Jeopardy and it should be about the you
have his claims that the election was
fake
and then in the nick of time
there's going to be a discovery that the
election was actually fraudulent
now I do not have any evidence
that I think is credible a fraud
I do have credible people saying you
know if you look online there are people
who are credible to me
who are saying that they found things
and this is the this is the new Kraken
but I'm I'm too primed not to accept a
new Kraken
is anybody with me on that
yeah I've been I've been slapped so hard
that you know I'm not I'm not going to
endorse any Krakens even if they look
good on paper because remember a lot of
the claims looked really good on paper
didn't they and I warned you from the
beginning that even if something is
fraudulent which I didn't know
that there will be 95 percent of the
plan the claims would be debunked and
properly debunked
and that's what we saw yeah we saw so
far 100 debunked that's the official
story
but do you think that means they don't
exist
I guess I went through that before but
it feels to me
like like the reality the simulation
the zeitgeist
every part of my body thinks he's going
to pull a rabbit out of a hat why do I
feel that I I feel it like it's already
happened
I feel it like a fact in the future
but I have no evidence for it no
evidence whatsoever there's nothing I
see nothing
that tells me that's going to happen
except it just feels like it it just
freaking feels like it
and I I feel like this this feels like a
thing is more meaningful than it sounds
you know if it were nothing but a
feeling but man it feels like that just
there's too much going on that the
frothiness of the topic
you can just feel it and I would
actually be surprised at this point if
he doesn't have a third act that shows
there was at least some meaningful fraud
and at least one important place
and if it turns out to be Georgia
oh my God
oh my God now I have no reason to
believe it would be no reason at all
but I feel it
I feel it
well of course Alan dershowitz says
weighed in on the Trump charges
um he largely thinks that they're a
political joke and I love I love reading
the Democrats who are giving me a hard
time online
because they're quite they're quite sure
that with this many indictments oh my
God so many indictments uh I think
there's ten thousand now right ten
thousand indictments
or something 10 or 13 or 72 or some
number so therefore he's clearly a
criminal that's been proven by the
indictments
but of course indictments are easy to
get doesn't mean anybody is guilty and
uh dershowitz basically thinks the
charges are
political and ridiculous and will no
matter what happens in the lower courts
the Supreme Court will laugh at them and
toss them out and that's his prediction
now if you're a Democrat and you're not
one of the top lawyers of all time
don't you feel a little silly saying
that he's the walls are closing in they
got him this time as long as long as
dershowitz is over here saying no I'm
predicting this will all go away it
would you know will affect the elections
of course but in the end it's it's all
transparently obviously
weak and political and the Supreme Court
will just wipe it away like like what's
from their eye
terrible analogy
um so he also points out that Rico which
you know and of course dershowitz has
been everywhere this important in the
law so he's like his personal friend is
the one who invented the RICO the RICO
statues he knows everything about Rico
right and he says it wasn't meant
for political people doing political
stuff I mean it was meant for other
purposes it's been repurposed from Mafia
to some other things but it made sense
when they repurposed it he doesn't think
this this application of Rico
is going to stand the uh the full full
test to the Supreme Court I guess
um dershowitz points out and I haven't
heard this anywhere else that the judge
in this case uh lied in public no she
lied and everybody else knows she lied
as a it's basically going to be a test
develop or a trial about somebody lying
but anyway the judge said they they're
trying to wrap it up in six months and
dershowitz just laughs at that because
the other thing she said is that she's
going to try all the the many defendants
sort of simultaneously and dershowitz
points out with that many defendants you
could have 50 lawyers in the room just
for the defendants you know let's say
they have two apiece and 50 lawyers
dealing with every motion
so somebody could say something like I'd
like to move the venue and then somebody
else could say I like this venue
and all 50 of them would have to hammer
it out
so that you have a process that not only
can't be done in six months
but it's really really really really
obvious
that the judge was lying because nothing
could be done nothing of that complexity
could be done in six months under those
conditions it just can't happen it's
undoable
and and our
uh is it the prosecutor I was the judge
I think it was the judge wasn't
oh the D.A oh I'm being a manufactured
it was the D.A not the judge
thank you thank you D.A not the judge
that's that's an important correction so
the D.A who said it would be six months
not the judge all right thank you for
that that's that's the beauty of the
live format I love being a fact check in
real time
I think that really helps
all right
so the biggest I think one of the
biggest keys to this uh the Trump
charges
are that perfect phone call as he says
do you remember how many times you've
seen
um
uh
that we need to find eleven thousand
seven hundred eighty votes you've seen
that in the headlines you've seen it
from pundits you've seen it on the news
right so that's all true
because it's on the news it's quoted and
you've probably even seen or you've
probably even heard audio of him saying
it have you not
well I found out today that this was
always a rupar and I didn't know it
now if you're new to me a rupar are you
par refers to a video but it could apply
to audio as well in which you delete
part of it and here's the weird
characteristic of a rupar deleting part
of it
reverses its meaning reverses it it
doesn't just take a Nuance away it
actually reverses it right so for
example some rupars were the fine people
hoax if you take away the part where he
says immediately after he said find
people he said I'm not talking about the
neo-nazis they should be condemned
completely if we remove that which they
did it reverses the meaning from
disavowing Nazis which he said
explicitly
to complementing them and supporting
Nazis it's a complete reversal by
removing one part
likewise with the drinking bleach Oaks
when they remove the part before he
talks about it and immediately after
those are the two clarifications
the clarifications were that he was
talking about light being brought into
the lungs you know literally putting a
stent down there or something and
Shining Light on the lungs as a possible
disinfectant the news removed the
reference of light on both ends and he
made sure he put it on both ends so you
wouldn't be confused
so they removed it and reported it and
that changed it to he wants you to drink
bleach
now drinking bleach is not even similar
in any way to Shining Light down your
down your uh down your lungs now I'm
watching some some people who are
finding this out for the first time
imagine you're watching this live stream
right now and you're hearing this for
the first time
and I just saw somebody go LOL
sorry
this is really mind-bending if you
haven't heard it before here's another
one the uh over feeding the koi
the the fish in Japan
so the real video showed uh Hughes with
uh I guess it was President Abe
and or one of the presidents I forget
who it was I think it was Abe right and
the two of them were feeding koi fish by
throwing some you know bread or whatever
in and then when they were done Abe led
by dumping the rest of his fish food in
because he was done and then Trump also
dumped his in because he was Following
the Leader literally
when you cut out the part where Abe went
first the news showed that Trump was a
big old dope instead of feeding the fish
like a little at a time he just dumped
his fish food and
that's a that's a rupar
um
you remember the Covington kids video
you it looked like the teenager was
getting in the face of some Native
American oh my God that kid fooled me
fooled me for 24 hours
but it's because they clipped out the
part where it was the Native American
guy who was actually getting in the face
of the kid it looked opposite if you
take that out so the rupar remember that
the rupar doesn't just change like a
detail
it complete it completely changes the
story to an opposite or something that's
horrible horrible in the opposite
direction
right so in the drinking bleach hoax
Trump was actually ahead of the
scientists because he was aware of a
trial that was actually being trialed at
that time to see if light would work as
a disinfectant in the trachea in the
lungs so he knew something above the
scientists and the News reversed it to
not only did he know more about you know
that one little thing but that he was so
dumb he thinks you should drink bleach
now half of the country actually
believed all of those things and still
does half of the country believes all of
those things because a rupar video is
really persuasive
it's really persuasive
so it turns out that this uh find the
fight 11 780 votes was it just another
rupar and I didn't find that out until
 today
is the day I found that out
can you believe it now I'll explain it
to you because you you might not be
aware of it I know for example Breitbart
did report this when it happened but I
think we lost you know if you ever knew
it you probably forgot it by now I did
um
here's his actual full statement so this
is on audio
we know this is his full statement
so look all I want to do is this I just
want to find 11 780 votes which is more
than we have because we won the state
which part did they take out
because we won the state
if you take out because we won the state
which is a very clear statement that he
believes that they're trying to take an
illegitimate result
look at it more closely
and come up with a legitimate vote
because he thinks he won
what part do they leave out every
 time
because we won the state what is the
entire the entire trial is about his
State of Mind did he really believe he
won the state
or not
now this alone would not be evidence of
his state of mind because they could
just say he was lying but it is evidence
not not conclusive but it's more
evidence of
of uh exculp it's I would say this is
exculpatory
exculpatory am I using that word right
it's evidence that we should be given
the public and certainly the court but
we should be given this evidence from
the beginning because this is the part
that gives you context to explain what
you're saying imagine you heard only
this
I just want you to find eleven thousand
seven hundred eighty votes
does that satellite Mafia talk
yeah a little bit a little bit doesn't
it sounds a little bit like Mafi talk
it's not guaranteed it's Mafia talk but
you could easily imagine it right you
could imagine it now you add
because we won the state is that what
the mafia guy says does the mafia guy
does the mafia boss say I'd like you to
go get that thing that we legally own
hey uh I'd like you to go to the store
and get me some products
all right I'm gonna steal some products
for you no no here's the money
take the money
go to the store
pay for the products bring them to me
and the change too yes the change too
go to the store pay for the products
put them in a bag get a receipt bring it
to me
that's what they're accusing of
they're accusing him of asking for
something he is specifically calling out
as legal
that's the mafia talk he might go to
jail because of a rupar audio
which basically is biased the entire
world so that by the time you reach the
jury pool you're so polluted that it
wouldn't matter what you heard at that
point
yeah it goes to his intention and his
intention is completely different
if he says I think I won
can you find the evidence of that by
looking more carefully
completely different
are you using an analogy no I'm using
several different stories
yeah oh the mafia analogy is that an
analogy
let me think it's let me uh let me tell
you the right way to use an analogy in
the wrong way the wrong way to use an
analogy is that that's your argument
right now hold on people think I'm
busted I'm not
I've always said the same
analogy is a good way to introduce
introduce a concept
it's not how you win an argument
so I think I said very clearly that the
argument is that he said he believes he
won the state so that's the argument
so the argument doesn't need the analogy
the analogy is in case you didn't catch
the argument it's like it's like another
way to bring you into the argument it's
not the argument right
so I'm not winning any arguments by an
analogy I'm using them to further
clarify a situation that's that is a
proper use
the improper use is to say it reminds me
of something and therefore
that's not a proper use
all right
but look look at look how much you
learned today
um
uh so
let me
let me run something by you
can you imagine Trump giving some kind
of a speech or national address or
something as he's running for office in
which he simply lays out how the gears
of the machine work
he simply lays out how the Biden you
know crime family does their work even
if the end result is there's no criminal
liability
just lay it out in case you didn't know
this is how that's done then move on to
the media and say all right here's some
things and he could even use the Peter
Zan
um explanation that they don't collect
real news they're really an opinion
manufacturing entities just sort of
describe that world
people say yeah that's probably true and
just describe some of the other worlds
such as how did the Russia collusion
hoax so could you imagine Trump
running through each of the hoaxes
including and this would make you happy
pandemic related hoaxes
or bad behavior let's say
imagine him laying out all of the parts
and saying and why did this happen well
follow the money
here's how this happened why did this
happen
follow the money
you can see the gears of the machine so
imagine the hymn it doesn't have to be
Trump but imagine somebody just laying
out
how everything works
because remember Dave Chappelle actually
gave him credit once for doing exactly
that when Trump said the system is
rigged and the reason he knows you know
the whole political system is rigged and
the reason he knows is that he's part of
the rigging as a citizen he was donating
to things and using the system so even
even Chappelle
said you know at least he told you
honestly you know that that's worth
something he actually told you to your
face how this system works
I wouldn't mind seeing a little more of
that would you
a little more of that please
yeah but he's got to find I think he
also he probably has to find election
rigging
he has to kind of prove it now correct
me if I'm wrong
um isn't Trump didn't he say on someday
soon he's going to do a big uh election
speech on Monday right so on Monday he's
going to present I guess the information
now do you expect that the information
he presents
is going to hold up
to scrutiny
because I imagine it's more than one
claim right I assume he's going to give
you several claims
if he gave you one claim
like one really good claim
I would say his odds of being right are
much higher than if he gives you five
if he gives you five it's going to look
like laundry list persuasion as in well
none of these are proven but look how
many there are you know where there's
smoke there must be fire sort of thing
that would be persuasion
if he gives you one
he might have the goods
so that's the first thing you look for
look for the one that just just wins the
day because maybe there is one who knows
I don't know uh
if he gives you the one that's really
strong and then can't help himself and
he's got to mention all the other ones
that are not as strong
that's a waste of time
that's just gonna all that will happen
is the news will debunk the weak ones
they will ignore the strong one am I
right you all know it they will ignore
the strong one they'll debunk the weak
ones and they'll tell you that they're
done and they're all debunked right that
now Trump could also explain that
because that's how the gears of the
machine work
imagine you're giving the speech and
saying all right now here's the here's
how the gears of the machine work I've
given you five examples one of them I
believe is really solid watch the news
coverage tomorrow they're only going to
talk about the other ones which even I
tell you need more investigation these
are not guaranteed these are just red
flags but watch how they treat the red
flags as the one they debunk if they can
and they ignore my strong one
now he won't do that but you know you
can imagine he could
well that's that's going to be must
watch TV
do you think there's anything that would
stop you from watching trumps uh try to
pull off the third act because that's
the third Act
if he pulls it off
that's the third Act
I wouldn't put a big Bet On It
because I don't know it'll be as clean
as he gives a speech and that's his
third act and everything changes I doubt
that because the media will just you
know try to eviscerate him no matter
what he says but it could be
then maybe he starts a spark of
something that maybe somebody later can
prove is real
we'll see I wouldn't expect any major
change on Monday but it's so I mean I'm
so interested you know what is it that
after all of these fake claims fake
meaning unproven
uh after all the times that you know he
got his hopes up do you think that this
is the time of all times is this the
time he would come forth with okay we we
finally got the goods this would be the
time
unless you really have it
I mean it would be a hell of a a hell of
a gutsy play
if he didn't have the goods
but you know it's possible he could
think he has them and doesn't you know
you never know
um
yeah all right so YouTube uh the new uh
rules are that they can ban you for
Content that disagrees with the World
Health Organization or local Health
officials like the CDC
Michael schellenberger is pointing out
that it will censor you if you disagree
with the World Health Organization
think about that
do you realize that I would have been
censored
so when the World Health Organization
first said
um some stuff about masks and I tried to
debunk them
I would have been banned on YouTube
amazing
all right
but then um Michael shellenberger says
YouTube isn't a social media platform
it's a propaganda platform and I said to
myself huh I kind of like that framing
because by my count
your your account might be different but
my by my count there's only one there's
only one social media platform and the
rest are propaganda platforms they're
advertising in propaganda
but there's one that's actually social
media that's X yeah x x is at least
trying
to be a social media platform the other
ones are just
um
essentially propaganda platforms that
suck money out of your pockets
uh
and uh sell the advertisers
all right
yeah you don't tweet anymore you exclaim
or you post post is the most boring word
for it but I guess that's where we're
going with
all right ladies and gentlemen
um
more to Elon musk's point
if you looked at me a year ago and you
said how do you prepare for this live
stream I would say I read the news
and I collect the news and then I talk
about it with my own opinions
but lately I've realized that I've done
the show without ever checking the news
because I checked social media which you
know picks out pieces from the news and
often refers to the the actual news
source but
that's the only way this seems to make
sense do you know why
if you go to CNN and you see a story
you're going to see the CNN spin of the
story
is that useful is worse than negative
it's worse than nothing
it would be better if you'd never seen
it because it's a spin it's opposite of
news it's you know it's a sort of
managed news if you go to Fox News are
you ever going to see him agreeing with
CNN now you know they have their own
spin on things
so if you see either news
you've got to go to both sources and
make sure you've cross-checked your work
which I do all the time I show you that
that I like to see something's true on
both platforms before I'm sure it's true
if only one platform says it's true well
I don't know probably not maybe
um however
I've noticed lately I can spend all of
my time on Twitter because if there's a
story that makes my hair on fire like ah
did somebody really do or say that
there'll be a community note or there'll
be another human saying No this is out
of context you know this is what they
left out here's a link to the opposite
story so when I read Twitter
I get the news from both directions when
I read any platform other other
so-called news platforms I have to go to
at least two sources so I've seen both
sides but Twitter has it there
automatically you know that you can
always count on the trolls to come in
and give you as much trouble as possible
the trolls actually are kind of useful
because even when they don't say you
know factual arguments they give you a
sense of how people are feeling
they give you a sense of how basically
how brainwashed they are when you see
the trolls let's say the trolls were not
just saying a bad thing they're they're
trying to argue that politics
you you should feel sorry for them
because the trolls are the most
hypnotized brainwashed people
they're not coming at you with their
better arguments they're coming out with
you know TDS so you can see the effects
of brainwashing best on the trolls so
don't you don't want to get rid of the
trolls they're like this little
indicator of how bad the brainwashing is
because the more brainwashing more
trolls
all right
uh the trolls are the ones who say it
was an insurrection
yeah so if you didn't know from the
trolls that they actually believed there
was an Insurrection on January 6 or an
attempted one
um you would not necessarily think
that's even a thing
like your your brain would say well
nobody's going to believe
the Republicans do an Insurrection
without weapons
and then what have you gone down the uh
the January 6th well
so each of the arguments that are fake
fake narrative arguments they all have
what I call the well
so it goes like this let's see if I can
roughly do it without preparing
January 6 was an armed insurrection
and then I come in and say
there's no such thing as Republicans
doing an armed Insurrection without
firearms
but it was violent
all right so you're going nothing well
all right all right so yeah they didn't
all have weapons but a lot of people had
weapons
okay but nobody actually brandished a
gun right
but they had guns all those guns were
taken away from them they had guns they
had bear spray they beat people with
objects
right right right but what percentage of
those people were involved in that
well there's a lot of violence there was
a lot of violence here here's all the
examples of all I know I know but
with all the people there
what percentage of them were actually
doing something violent well you know
people got killed right right right
Ashley Babbitt got killed
and some of the police officers died
soon after and that's very tragic and
may have been in large part because of
it
tragic
or so you can just keep going down the
well
But ultimately they have to believe that
Republicans try to conquer the country
by trespassing in a building
you you take the trolls all the way down
to but ultimately what you believe
is that weapons or not violence or not
that the plan for Conquering the country
was to wander around in the building
what do they say after you get to the
bottom of the well and say but explain
explain how the rest of their plan went
so you trespass
and then you get the nuclear codes
and who delivers them does the guy who
carries the football actually knock on
the door and say it looks like we have
new leadership you trespassers which one
of you a guy with advice on the hat I
got the nuclear how can you connect the
dots
okay just just tell me how the plan was
going to work its this way out
when you get to the bottom of the well
and you get to that point what does the
troll say remember they're deeply
hypnotized these are not people
operating under reason they are
literally and I'm not I'm not saying
this for political
you know points or anything they're
actually brainwashed actually literally
brainwashed what do they do
well in my experience they say something
like
Well why'd your wife leave you
that's what I get
or I get why is your steps Undead
that's what I get
yeah when you get to the bottom of the
well it's pretty dark down there
right so if you don't have the stones to
go to the bottom of the well five times
a day you need to stay off Twitter I
spend a lot of time in the bottom of the
well
all right
that's all I got for today thanks for
watching YouTube it's the best show
you've ever seen or ever we'll see until
tomorrow
bye
