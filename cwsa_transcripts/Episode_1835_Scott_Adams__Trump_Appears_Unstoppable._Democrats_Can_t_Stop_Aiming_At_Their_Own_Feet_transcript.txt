it's called coffee with scott adams it's
famous all over the internet
and
if you would like to enjoy this
experience
if you'd like to enjoy
ego death
and who wouldn't really all you have to
do
is find yourself
a copper mug or a glass of tanker
chelsea steiner canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine hit of the
day it's the thing that's going to make
everything better
it's called
simultaneous
happens right now
go
well you on youtube don't know how close
it was
to me not having a cup of coffee
but i took the locals people with me on
a little tour of the house before you
got here
and the coffee maker delivered so it's
all good now
so here's a story that i'm following
i think i may have mentioned this but
it's getting more interesting
so virtual reality apparently can
simulate
what people are describing as ego death
which is also how people describe a
hallucinogenic experience
now people also say they get
all kinds of mental health and maybe
even cures from addiction there are lots
of claims
from um
hallucinogenics from lsd mushrooms etc
now
i'm not a doctor so i'm not going to
tell you that those are good ideas or
bad ideas
these are just things that people report
but they're reporting similar things
with virtual reality and they are now
consciously comparing the two
and there is some speculation now
that you might be able to achieve some
form of ego death
with vr
and then if you did
there there's some hopefulness that you
might get some of the same benefits
maybe weaker than the than the chemical
kind
but may be useful
for example here's how they did they do
it
if you take a hallucinogen and you feel
yourself connected to everything
that's a form of ego death
because ego is everything's about me
i exist here and then i'm observing the
outside world
so the outside world is separate from me
i'm just the observer
but with ego death you sort of merge
with the environment
that's your impression of it
and so you're not in a distinct
individual you're connected to
everything else
and once you feel connected to
everything else
allegedly
hypothetically
there's some kind of mental health
benefit that could be substantial that
comes from that i don't know exactly why
sometimes sometimes you don't need to
know the why
sometimes you just see it works use it
so here's how they do it in vr in vr you
imagine yourself in a space as just a
glowing
sort of a gaseous glowing form
and that represents you
and so you come to see yourself in vr as
this gaseous form and then three other
people will appear
in your room
just from anywhere anywhere in the world
so three other people will appear they
will also be gaseous forms
so the first thing that you learn is
that your body isn't just what it looks
like
right your your visual sense of yourself
isn't all that there is
so when you see yourself as a gaseous
form it allows you to get outside your
mental model of being a body
you just exist but then it gets
interesting
then they have you move your gaseous
swarms together
until you can't tell where your gashes
form and the other gaseous forms you
begin and end
apparently
reportedly
you experience something like ego death
because you've imagined yourself as this
gaseous form you've merged it with other
gaseous forms
and apparently you can feel
some kind of experience from that
now it's hard to understand it just from
having to explain to you right
an explanation is always going to fall
short
but it's the same problem with
hallucinogens
try to explain
a hallucinogenic experience
to someone who has never had one it
can't be done
it can't be done it is impossible to
explain
so maybe there's something there you
know the fact that i can't explain it
well might actually be
a feature not a bug
anyway so that's looking good i think
we're very close to the time to the
point where
virtual reality fixes all of our mental
problems
with the exception of a few that are
purely organic
you know like an actual schizophrenic
might have you know a brain that's
differently
differently configured but for the your
routine stuff where your programming is
out of whack but your brain is still
you know functionally a brain
i've got a feeling that vr will be able
to program the hell out of us
i don't think we have any idea how much
that will program our entire existence
so that's common could be good or bad
probably both
here's something that nobody says out
loud so i'll say it first
if biden succeeds in getting his army of
auditors
who primarily as i understand it would
focus on smaller businesses
he's going to learn a very uncomfortable
fact
and i don't know if
i don't know if anybody in the biden
administration knows it
because administrations tend to be
filled with people who have not worked
in small businesses
how many people who work in the biden
administration
once ran a gardening business you know
where he mowed loans or she
not many right
and here's what i think
is a problem that they're going to
discover
in my opinion no more than 20 of small
businesses could survive and audit
and when i say survive i mean stay in
business
what do you think
because small businesses live almost
entirely on cheating on taxes
small businesses have small margins
right there they're just getting by
they're earning more than their spending
but not by a lot
and if you taxed what they earned you
would
there just wouldn't be anything left
so in my experience
at the smallest end and i'll make a
distinction here if you're talking about
a small business being one that only
makes 10 million a year
that's not the small business i'm
talking about i'm talking about the
really small business the cash
businesses
those businesses are
really couldn't exist if they paid taxes
let's be honest they couldn't exist
so what happens if they start closing
down 80 of small businesses because they
can't pass the audit
what happens if the
it's the same problem that you would
have if you crack down on immigration
if you crack down on immigration
probably 80 percent of small businesses
in california would close
tomorrow did you know that
if you crack down on immigration if you
had a way to do it completely you knew
everybody who had fake documents and you
immediately fired them and
sent them back wherever they came
every small business in california would
be out of business just immediately so
there are some laws that you can't
enforce
because the system has gone too far
building a an economy that depends on
the lack of enforcement
if you change it to an economy that has
a an enforcement
i think eighty percent of the smallest
businesses would just go away if they
got audited now i don't know if there
are enough water to audits to get all
the way down to your
you know to the lowest level so maybe
it's just you know companies that only
made 10 million that year
that'd be different
um here's an interesting
comment i saw on a tweet but i agree
with it
so
we seem to understand as a species
based on science
that fields collapse when they're
observed or measured in other words
reality
seems to form after it's observed
now i've heard some people argue that
but that's my that's my understanding of
it
and i'm seeing the same guy saying no no
no all right i i'm going to say that i
completely disagree with your
disagreement of me
i will accept your superior
understanding of knowledge of science
but i think that's a handicap in this
case
i believe that once you get into the
quantum science realm
we're using words to describe things
that words can't describe
and we're using formulas to find truth
when all we've really found is that the
formula works
it doesn't it doesn't extend into our
understanding of reality
and so in in my opinion
it is true
that reality does not become
formed and solid until it's observed or
measured
and i'll accept that there's somebody
who says that's not true but that's my
interpretation i'm going with it for now
now under that interpretation
the more people there are in the world
there are more people seeing stuff and
measuring stuff
so you would need more
more solid stuff in the world because
there are more people who are
experiencing it
and the comment was that if you build a
a huge telescope let's say a hubble
telescope and you can peer further and
further into the infinity
that the simulation that we live in has
to process harder
to create all this new stuff that's
being seen
and when you take it to seeing all of
space with a telescope you might be
seeing things too fast for the processor
to catch up
and you might be seeing some glitches
and there are processing
because we're trying to chunk too much
data at the same time
now
what would that look like
well one would be code reuse like this
the system would try to become more
efficient
to you know find workarounds around its
constraints
so it might say all right i'm going to
make a lot of these people the same
people
because a lot of the npcs
don't need full lives and histories
they don't need to be full people
so you just make them a little more
restricted than before
so they just say the same thing on
social media
i've been tagging people as npcs on
twitter
if they say the most obvious thing you
can say
in this situation
and i think that's one way you'd save
space you can make your npcs never have
a creative thought
you just give them all the same three
ideas so if you say npcs
you know
what are you going to say about
that dilbert cartoonist guy
well
we're gonna
we'll all say
we think he's the garfield guy
it saves a lot of processing because
there's no thinking it's not creative
it's not new and they just all say the
same thing
so if you see a lot of
coincidences
a lot of repeated
npc activity
maybe the processor is getting
overloaded
maybe
but watch out for those big telescopes
crashing the simulation i i didn't write
down whose tweet it was who said that
that wasn't that wasn't my original
thought
i wish i'd written it down
all right here's uh this story is called
when wokeness gets too complicated
so there was a tweet by the
twitter account the women's march
and this is a statement that they
tweeted the women's march tweeted your
feminism has to be intersectional or
it isn't
feminism this they emphasize it with
capitals and spaces or
it isn't feminism so your feminism has
to be intersectional to be good feminism
but there was some disagreement on that
by somebody who's on the same team but
disagrees with that framing
so
a twitter account called uh
claire shrugged
tweeted back and said as a black
feminist
who considers intersectionality a core
guiding principle
i am begging you
stop deploying it as a buzzword to
problematize feminist politics with
center women
you you undermine black feminist
struggle and alienate many world
many who'd support the vision crenshaw
outlined
i don't know who crenshaw is not
not the crenshaw in congress
did anybody understand that
did you know what any of that meant
now here's the interesting thing
i'm pretty sure everybody involved
in these opinions has good intentions
i believe that
i believe they have good intentions
and now here they are disagreeing with
each other but my
my problem here is that it got too
complicated
so the thing that i make fun of that
made dilbert popular and i've said this
before but it's worth
reiterating
dilbert is not about something that
somebody did wrong
it seems like it if you read it it's
like oh management did this wrong
management did that wrong management did
that wrong it's not really what it's
about
it's actually a little bit more subtle
than that
dilbert is about a good idea
that is implemented wrong
so a good idea would be managing your
employees right it's hard to have a
company if you don't manage your
employees but how do you do it wrong you
micromanage you do too much of it
so doing too much of something
is usually the way corporations do it
wrong
they've got some little idea that's a
good idea in certain ways and then they
over extend it to everybody's got to be
doing everything everybody's got to be
woke everybody's going to be whatever
so that's where they that's where they
go wrong but woke-ism looks like it's
going to uh destroy itself with
complexity
because if the people who would be the
wokest are arguing about
feminism has to have intersectionality
or as a black feminist who considers
intersectionality a core guiding
principle i am begging you to stop
deploying it as buzzword to problematize
feminist politics which center women you
undermine black feminists struggle and
alienate many who support your vision
according to somebody
a little bit too complicated
a little bit
all right uh cbs morning reported this
that today children are 30
well they're more obese so they're 30
less aerobically fit than their parents
were at their age and the study points
to climate change and rising
temperatures as adversely affecting
childhood obesity
because children spend less time
exercising outdoors
because of the climate change
you're asking the right question is that
a satire is it
is it did i just make that up
go
did i just prank you
did i read it did i read something
that's definitely from
from a satire account
that you couldn't tell
could you tell if that was real
was it real real or not real
it's
real
it's real
yeah
it's real
cbs news actually said there's a study
that says the kids are getting fat
because of climate change they don't
want to go outdoors
because the weather's bad
do we even need to discuss that
is that something where i need to like
get into the details of
you know what else has changed has
anything else changed
can you think of anything
any other
i don't know
any other big impact on society
has anything changed lately
you know kova kova certainly made a
difference lately but the bigger change
is screens and you know not having
basically just lifestyles changed and
food got worse food got worse
our entertainment choices got better in
the sense that there are more of them
but they're less physical they're video
games right so between video games and
screens and terrible food you have all
the explanation you need
does anybody have the experience of
they've exercised less because of the
weather
is there what is there even one person
on here who believes that they exercise
less lately
because of the weather
not one person
not one person
now i don't know about where you live
but even on days when the weather is
very much don't go outdoors weather
where i live there's usually one part of
the day where it's not that bad
so it could be you know 100 degrees
during the afternoon but you can pretty
much depend that
six in the morning if you wanted to go
for a run you'd be fine
right now i don't know if it's true as
true in other places someplace where
it's just cold permanently and some
places just hop permanently
but i've never i've never seen any
difference
where i live
i just heard the funniest question
yesterday
i'm going to share it with you
i'm not going to tell you where it came
from
but somebody somebody mentioned to me
that they were going to go to florida
for their first experience i'd never
been to florida before
and going to florida in august
florida in august
and the person said to me i hear it's a
it could be humid there
it could be human
to which i said with a stray face
yes it can
yeah it's true
and then the person said is a human like
hawaii because i've been to hawaii so i
know what humidity feels like
i was tempted to say yes just like
hawaii
but i couldn't make myself be enough of
an to do it
yeah i suppose why is humid
[Laughter]
here's the difference
i would like to give you
my impression
of walking let's say off of the airplane
and feeling hawaii's humidity for the
first time
and then i'll do feeling florida's
humidity for the first time
somebody was never experienced either
we'll start with
hawaii experiencing humidity for the
first time
wow
what what is up with this this feels
great
why does my entire body feel good
i think the air feels better
i feel great
let's have a vacation snorkel anybody
alright so that's that's experiencing
hawaii humidity for the first time
now i'd like to
give you a similar impression
of going outdoors for the first time in
august
in florida
for those of you listening
it was hilarious
it was hilarious
so
florida and august should be fine
you'll be fine you'll be fine
all right
i saw i was following a hashtag on
twitter
and
uh i see that the
i see that the uh unvaccinated are
taking a victory lap
so the unvaccinated is saying we were
the smart ones and we've been
vindicated
and validated
is that the news you're
seeing how many would agree with the
statement
that the people who wrote out the um the
entire pandemic with no vaccinations at
all
how many would agree that they were the
smart ones and they have been totally
validated
go
yes
so the people who are vaccinated who are
not vaccinated they say they've been
validated
i'm looking at your answers they seem to
be somewhat mixed somewhat mixed
why is it that we all watch the same
news
and the same science
and the most basic question of the
pandemic
we still disagree on
what causes that
what would cause the unvaccinated to say
we won were the smart ones and science
has proven it at the very same time
that the people were vaccinated were
glad they did
how do you explain that
can you can you explain it with two
words
yeah confirmation bias would be one
but confirmation bias is sort of the
weak form of what i'm talking about it's
cognitive dissonance right but the thing
is you don't know who hasn't
that's the fun part
so
let me do what almost nobody will ever
do in front of you
this is very rare what i'm going to say
you will almost never see a public
figure who talks you know somebody who
talks for a living in front of people
you almost never see anybody say what
i'm going to say now
it could be me
because that's how cognitive dissonance
works
i'll tell you my impression
if you put a gun to my head and said
you're going to have to choose who's
right
i would choose the i'm right
whatever that is
you know we don't it doesn't matter for
this discussion it doesn't even matter
i would still choose i'm right
so if you ask me all right you know that
there's thing called cognitive
dissonance
and you also know
that you might be easily triggered by it
because i'm in a situation where i could
be triggered into it so you should
always look for the trigger
if you're trying to decide who's got
cognitive dissonance who and who doesn't
you look for the trigger and the trigger
would be that something happened this
opposite of what you believed was
possible or could happen
right
now did that happen
is there anybody who believed the
opposite of what was proven to be true
and here's the problem
it's everybody
every everybody
everybody believed something that was
the opposite of true
no matter which side you were on do you
know why
because truth bifurcated
so if you thought that vaccinations were
a good idea there's plenty of
studies and proof to show you were
wrong
if you thought they were a good idea
there's plenty of evidence to say you
were right
so both sides have evidence that
confirms their right
and other equally strong looking
evidence you know we're bad at knowing
what's strong evidence but to many
people it looks wrong the opposite
so you have a situation where a hundred
percent of the public
could be
could be
potentially triggered into cognitive
distance
but you don't know which half it was
at least half
probably both
i'm not sure anybody is
uh in a situation where they can say for
sure they have no trigger so let me give
an example of no trigger
if you predicted something correctly
so you're the only one who said let's
say
you know let's say i predicted that
trump would get elected in 2016.
and then i was right
was cognitive dissonance triggered no no
because what i thought would happen
happened
but suppose you thought it was
impossible he'd get elected in
2016. well then you think there must
have been something like russian
interference
because your cognitive dissonance
couldn't allow
that you you simply saw something happen
that you thought wouldn't happen
now fast forward to 2020.
trump supporters were positive many of
them
positive that he was going to win that
election and then things reversed late
at night and that looked sketchy and
that was the trigger
so everybody who thought that trump
really won and the election was rigged
i don't know what the truth of this
question is so we're not going to talk
about what's true and what's false
that's unknowable to me
you know some of you think you know it
but i don't know
so
under those conditions
nearly 100 of trump supporters should
have been triggered into cognitive
dissonance
should have
now
the there there's a deep assumption in
this
the deep assumption is that the election
was something like fair
but we don't know
right we only know there's no
no court approved
proof that it was anything but fair
that's all we know
but if you believe that
you obviously saw something that went
wrong then cognitive dissonance would
kick in
so can you tell the difference between
let me ask you here this will be a test
to see if you've learned anything
could you
individually not other people
we're not talking about other bill you
could you
tell the difference between a stolen
election
and your own cognitive dissonance go
yes or no
could you tell the difference between a
stolen election and your own cognitive
dissonance
the locals people all have the correct
answer right the answer is no
you cannot tell the difference
but we act like we can don't we
and i'm no exception
but we sort of have to act
on our beliefs all right
i got a smattering of yeses
so there's a small smattering of people
who say yes i can tell the difference
between a stolen election and
cognitive
distance but there are far more people
so on locals listen to this
on locals you should know that your
answers are far more um let's say
intellectually
valid
than on youtube there should there's
difference and there should be
because i spend more time talking to the
locals people they would be far more
educated on the fact that you can't tell
the difference
cognitive dissonance
by definition you can't tell the
difference
by definition
so it's not a question of whether you
can use your power
to power through the cognitive
dissonance it's just what the word means
the word means you can't tell
if you could tell you wouldn't be in it
so it's just a definitional thing
all right
i don't think anybody should be taking a
victory lapse about the pandemic
but we're all going to do it and this is
one of those beautiful times
when once we're after you know in my
opinion we're
post pandemic
you know there's lingering problems
forever but we're kind of post the worst
part of the pandemic and
what could be better than everybody
thinking they were right the whole time
because i do
i i believe that my choices were
probably as close to the smartest risk
reward choices i could have made in my
specific situation not yours
you know yours was different but in my
specific situation now others would
disagree with me but the beauty is
i will now be able to go forward and say
i did all the right things i was so
smart and the people who did opposite of
what i did i could do the same thing
they'll say they were smart and they got
the right answer and i'm an idiot
so we all win
it'd be bad if we were in the pandemic
but once you're over it you both get to
celebrate how right you were even though
half of us were not don't know which
half though we'll never know
don't you love it when the democrats
try to make things
uh
different by just changing their names
you know the
the inflation reduction act that was
anything but etc
well here's the newest uh
entry
did you know that if you remove or
destroy any military information it's
espionage
so there's something called the
espionage act that trump is being
threatened with
um because of the documents at
mar-a-lago
but apparently if you read it if you if
you accidentally
well i guess you'd have to do it
intentionally if you destroyed any
military records
which is a pretty big category isn't it
military records
like that's a lot of stuff
anything that's military related i'm not
talking about like
their actual records but anything that
references the military if you move it
without using the right process i guess
or you destroy it
you're guilty of espionage
is that the word you would have used
would you have used the word espionage
for mishandling classified information
now i get why they would
because they don't want to leave any
opening that
you know moving documents could ever
have a good reason
so i get i get why they're going extreme
on that
but
when you see the news reporting that uh
trump is being
considered for espionage act charges
is that news
that doesn't feel like news i mean it's
new
but it feels like
pure propaganda
if they were even a little bit honest
they would say
uh the espionage act
is written to be intentionally broad
and it captures even things like
accidentally moving well i don't know if
it accidentally counts but it counts
things like moving things without using
the right process
or you would say
trump is might be accused of doing
something
with moving
documents you know secure documents he
may have used the wrong process to move
secure documents
which
weirdly
if you were writing the story honestly
you say which weirdly
is included in this big category called
the espionage act even though obviously
the intention would not be espionage in
these cases
now
there's no way you can call the news
honest when they call this a problem of
espionage am i right
and by the way
i don't know if fox news covers it this
wrong way
but when you see like the trending stuff
and a lot of the headlines
you'll see
might be guilty of the espionage
now espionage seems a little too close
to russia collusion doesn't it
doesn't it
you know he was
i don't think so
now
um
let's let's dig into this by the way
here's the best
mar-a-lago joke so far
the best mar-a-lago joke uh was not mine
uh twitter user greg marchand md
tweeted this
actually we're all good now because
trump declassified the documents the fbi
planted
so they cancelled each other out
okay that's really good
yeah it's so good i'm pissed off that i
didn't think of it first like why didn't
i think of that one
yes yes that was perfect
um
but here's the funny part obviously you
know it's not literally true but it
could have been true
you can imagine that if if trump had
said everything in these boxes is
declassified
and let's say there was some record of
that just hypothetically if there was
some record of trump saying
everything in these 10 boxes is
declassified he didn't do that as far as
i know but suppose he did
and then later
hypothetically the fbi planted some
evidence in it
that would actually be to correct me if
i'm wrong but if nobody knew it had been
planted
wouldn't the
when the legal standard be that it had
been declassified if it's in that box
because that was in the box that was
specified for declassification in a
hypothetical world not in the real world
so it actually is true
this is why it's so funny there could
have been a situation where the fbi
planted something that was t that got
accidentally declassified and then
didn't work as a planted evidence like
that's actually real right i mean
it didn't happen
but it's something that might have
happened
like in the real world that could have
easily happened
now i say easily because in my sense of
things the fbi planting information
would be normal
if you don't agree with that you
pay attention to the news once a while
if you don't think it's normal
that the fbi would try to frame trump by
planting information he hasn't been
paying attention
that is now in the normal way of
business for the fbi
i hate to say it
but i didn't create that situation
it wasn't me and if it had been me i
wouldn't have done it
but that's where we are right
and
every time you tell me in
in uh
i don't know
patriotic
emotional terms that we should not be
criticizing the rank-and-file members of
the fbi
i'm not sure that's us doing that
you know what i mean
i feel like the rank and file fbm by fbi
members have been
disgraced by their own co-workers and
leaders
i didn't do that
where was i disgracing the fbi by
by
falsifying information on a fisa
document i didn't do that
and you can't say that that has no
consequences there's there are reasons
that this stuff is illegal because has
big consequences one of the consequences
is on the rank and filed members of the
fbi i didn't do that
i didn't do that
so if i say the fbi is completely
discredited as an organization which
includes the rank and file
i didn't do that
i didn't do that i'm just observing
it's not even an opinion
an opinion means you're sort of adding
something to the situation i'm not
adding i'm observing
i'm observing a situation that has
you know a degree of confirmed bad
actors confirmed
nobody's questioning that the mueller
report you know found some some issues
was it mueller or was it not mueller was
the other guy
you know what i mean all right
so here's some more stuff we know about
these mar-a-lago documents so i guess in
june in a letter in june one of the
trump lawyers i don't know which one
uh
said that there were no more classified
things at trump's mar-a-lago
now
do attorneys tell direct lies in a
situation like that
now i'm not going to say no attorney has
ever lied
but there's a way
there's a way that attorneys lie right
so an attorney could lie by omission
you know if it was a situation where
they could get away with it
they could exaggerate they could prefer
a narrative
they could question somebody else's
facts they could you know
put doubt on things that actually are
true
they're all kinds of schemey weasley
things that lawyers can do
but how how how likely is it
that a lawyer who had who had reached a
level of accomplishment that they worked
for a president or an ex-president
somebody at that level how likely is it
they would tell a direct
lie
that if they got caught and it's very
catchable
it would be very catchable because it
exists it's a physical thing
and someday somebody's going to figure
it out would a lot would a lawyer tell a
direct lie this does not exist
if that lawyer knew it did exist could
be later found
i don't think they do
in my experience they i've have you ever
seen i mean i've dealt with a lot of
lawyers
and anytime they get even
um anytime you get even close
to asking a lawyer to do to say or do
something that's not true they
immediately balk right
so
now i'm gonna i'll acknowledge
to you that there are uh lawyers who
will lie
just like they're anything that will lie
but it's kind of unusual
it's unusual so remember when we're
looking into this fog of war situation
we don't know what's true
yet if we ever will
but we could put odds on things
what would be what would you put on the
what would you put as the odds
that this particular lawyer
and they have to accept all of it not
just part of it what are the odds that
this lawyer knew the contents this is
important do you think that the lawyer
knew the contents of all of this stuff
at mar-a-lago
probably not
right probably not
do you think anybody did
do you think there was even one person
anywhere in the world
who knew the contents of all the boxes
in mar lago
i would say that's unlikely
because you know who would spend the
time going through them
who would know for sure that they had
all the boxes
i know it feels unknowable
right
so
what are the odds that trump is in
trouble
if his attorney
said there was nothing there
now i don't know if if you haven't
operated at a level where you've got
attorneys and accountants doing stuff
for you it is a real good uh cover for
your own
badness if there is any
right if your attorney says something's
okay
you're in a much better position than if
you decided on your own
right because the the judge and the jury
are going to look at and say well
that was a qualified attorney who gave
you that advice it might have been wrong
but look where it came from
so if somebody who knows more than you
do says this is legal and it's my job to
tell you what's legal and trust me this
is totally legal
and you take the advice
correct me if i'm wrong but that's going
to give you a little comfort if anything
goes to court is there a lawyer on here
who can i'm not i'm not totally
confident about this point
can you confirm or deny that point say
you're a lawyer in the comment
but if a lawyer has advised you that
something's legal aren't you in better
shape you're not safe i'm not saying
you're safe but you're in better shape
right
any lawyers
okay so a lawyer a lawyer confirms yes
you're in much better shape doesn't mean
you're out of the clear you're out of
the woods yeah okay the lawyers are
confirming
lawyers confirm that that would help
so that's a point in trump's favor
which doesn't tell you anything about
the documents
now here's a question that um
you all watch the news
all right
so all of you watch the news so here's a
question which is the most obvious
question about this mar-a-lago stuff
there's one question that's the most
obvious question it's the one that you
would ask
if you were in charge of figuring out
what's going on over there what's the
first question you'd ask about the boxes
go
first question you'd ask
really who backed them yes right the
first question you ask is who packed
them
what's the answer to the question you
all watch the news
give me the names of the people who pack
them give me their names
don't just say gsa
just give me the name
why you don't know the name
what
now here's a moment where you need to
this is a moment where the entire
machinery
of your reality just opened up for you
there's sometimes you can see the
mechanism behind
behind what we're seeing
here this is like the fact that you
don't know the names the actual name of
the person who packed it or names of
the fact that those people have never
been asked to comment
and we don't even know who they are
what's that tell you
what does that tell you
it tells you we're not serious about
this whatever is going on has nothing to
do with the documents
am i right
let me say this as clearly as possible
if anybody in the news business had even
the slightest interest
in what was going on in that story
the only thing they'd be talking about
incessantly was how do we find the names
of the people who packed it
and can we get permission to talk to
them
because they might have you know
clearance or whatever
am i wrong
tell me i'm wrong
it's the only question that matters
and and the entire news industry is
ignoring it like it doesn't matter
what's that telling you
it tells you nobody's serious about this
as an issue
they're serious
about it as a political issue
nobody cares
about the actual event
nobody
in fact i've never even met anybody who
cared there are people who say oh trump
was going to sell nuclear secrets to
saudi arabia
do they really believe that
the people who are tweeting that trump
was going to sell nuclear secrets they
really believe that no they don't it's
just a political thing
do the supporters of president trump
who say
as i do
it's very unlikely there's anything in
those documents that is really important
it's very unlikely
am i saying that for political reasons
or because i
i know what's in those boxes i don't
know what's in the boxes
i don't know
but i've got this political opinion
that's pretty strong
which means i need to check myself right
shouldn't i be checking myself for
confirmation bias
you know team play
and cognitive dissonance absolutely
absolutely i should be checking myself
really hard if i could it's pretty hard
to check
but
i don't think there's anything more
completely transparent
than the fact that all sides of the
media left right and in between
nobody has the bit of interest
and who packed the boxes and nothing
else matters
let me let this is the strongest
statement i can make nothing else
matters
but who packed the boxes
i'm not wrong
and as soon as you hear it
how pissed off are you
if you hadn't already you know realized
that you were being um gaslighted by
both sides this is one of those times
when both sides are equally guilty
if if if fox news
wanted to
find out about the topic
they'd be saying can we talk to whoever
packed the boxes
you think they can't find them
let me give you another example
is this the first time
that the most important question has not
even been asked by either the left or
the right
there's another time this happened
can you think of it
but when was the time a really big story
and there was one question that was easy
easy to answer
it was easy to answer
and nobody asked
the find people march
yeah charlottesville
what was the most important question
the most important question for which
all of the news depended
is were there any attendees
who are not racist
and not actually marching with the
racist you know physically they weren't
with them but they were there for their
own reasons it's the only thing that
mattered because the president made a
statement that they existed
the media said no they don't
and they went from that assumption
how do they know
do you know who talked to the um people
in charlottesville who attended
just me
as far as i know
i'm the only person out of seven billion
who said well why don't we just ask him
so i just tweeted i think i tweeted it
is there anybody is there anybody there
who wants to talk to me and is not a
racist
and then a number of people contacted me
and i talked to them individually
and they convinced me with you know the
totality of their story of how they got
there etc that they were in fact not
racists
and they disavowed the racists in direct
language
we're now standing with them marching
with them associating with them
we're just in a different place they
were at the event but they weren't
anywhere near the marchers
so
why is it that fox news has never
reported that
it's because they don't care about the
topic
they don't care because the topic is
easy
to to discern
you could do it today you know you can
still just say all right did you go
if you went
do you consider yourself a non-racist
defend yourself and then they would and
and well they would do it well
so
this is another example where the news
has
i would say
it looks intentional
it looks like neither the left nor the
right have any interest in what's in
those documents
in the real world sense
they only care about it as a story and
as a political thing
because would the story just disappear
if you knew who packed the boxes
it might
the entire story would disappear suppose
you you
talked to the people who packed the
boxes and just suppose they said
something like this
well trump did tell us what to put in
the boxes
but he just sort of went in the room and
said some general things and we did the
best we could because we were in a hurry
and we couldn't really ask him every
single question so we did the best we
could we just threw things in the boxes
and then you find out did trump ever
know what was in the boxes
did his lawyers ever know what was in
the box did anybody ever do a full
inventory later to find out
from trump's perspective whether there
was anything bad in those boxes
probably not
so would the whole story go away
if you knew that the people who packed
the boxes were making their own
decisions
while the people who
uh
received them never really fully knew
what was in them
that's that the whole thing would go
away wouldn't it
the moment you realized that people who
packed the boxes
were operating a little bit
independently it's sort of that's the
end of the question
because nobody thinks that trump was
down there with a clipboard doing an
inventory of the boxes and i doubt he
ordered anybody to do it
do have you ever seen any reporting to
say as well
you know trump ordered somebody to look
through all of the boxes and you know
really double check to see if there was
any any classified stuff in there
i know that would be an obvious story if
we'd ever heard of it
right
so
scott the sophist
all right we're gonna stop right there
so one of the ways to know an npc
is if they listen to your point
and then they call you a sophist
because they're they're like a dozen
things that you can say that don't have
any
um you don't have to
show your argument
so uh acme trader is the name of this
account here on youtube says scott the
softest at it again
that's an npc
i'll bet if you ask the acme trainer to
tell me a story about your childhood
he'd say i'd love to but i'm busy
that's a person who has actually no soul
in all likelihood and is a walking npc
anymore
let's stop saying pack the boxes it
sounds so nasty
it does sound a little dirty
do you know most of the news sounds
dirty if you read it that way
let's try
that who packed the boxes
they packed those boxes hard yeah it
does it works a little bit
so you know there's a story that was a
big national story or a global story
really and i totally ignored
until there was something that was funny
about it and then it caught my interest
but
how many of you know what happened in
sri lanka
like i saw a lot of headlines about sri
lanka and i ignored all of them
because i couldn't figure out what sri
lanka had to do with me
so i didn't know what was going on
so i knew there was some big meltdown
and sri lanka was falling apart and
the government was not popular
[Music]
something something
but that's all i knew
so here's the actual story
um
they elected a new president
who
was anti-fertilizer
he thought that fertilizers
he didn't have any scientific backing
for this but he thought that
some kinds of fertilizers
were causing kidney diseases
and so then he banned fertilizers in
2021
which caused the yield of crops to go
way down which you know when you combine
it with the pandemic related stuff
caused a full meltdown
and so here is the actual story
and i'm not making this up i'm just
going to give you the headline
the way i see it
right here's the headline the way i see
it
uh
sri lanka ran out of fertilizer because
the president was full of
well now you have my attention
they ran out of fertilizer because their
president was full of
that really happened
now i understand it because until you
can put it in the form of a joke
to me it's just noise
i need the joke
so now that you have the joke we can
understand this the bigger issue here is
that this this fertilizer question
apparently is a pretty big one
so i didn't even know there was an
anti-fertilizer
you know
group of people
but
there are and this anti-fertilizer thing
would be one of the scariest things in
the world
i think we'll figure it out
i think we'll figure it out but this is
one of the biggest problems in the world
the lack of fertilizer and one of the
least discussed
and i've known about this for
15 years like this is one of those that
you can see coming for a long time first
time i heard about it was about 15 years
ago
and it's just gotten worse since then
so at the same time that that's
happening apparently uh europe
is having
um a drought like they've never had
and i swear to god every time there's a
national story it's really about me
like this is one of those things that
makes me think none of you are real and
i'm just creating this out of my own
mind
because
i'm not big on travel
i don't know if i've ever mentioned that
i've done i've done
a little bit of you know
big trips
but it's usually because somebody else
wants to do it right you know a spouse
wants to do it i'm not really i got to
go to europe i got to go to asia i'm not
that guy i just don't i built a i built
a world in which i don't need to leave
you know in case there's a pandemic or
something worked out pretty well didn't
it
yeah i would like to take a moment to
pat myself in the back
i literally built my house
to
be something i could live in if i
couldn't leave the house
that was actually a design element if i
ever have to not leave the house i was
thinking of house arrest actually
i was i was assuming there's always a
good chance if you're if you're at a
certain income level there's a good
chance you're gonna have house arrest at
some point
it doesn't even matter if you commit a
crime
somebody will accuse you something
so
um
but there was one exception
every time i saw the advertisements for
the so-called river cruises in europe
where they have the smaller cruise ships
that they could go down the rivers they
stop at these great castles and have
amazing scenery the whole way
um you know i clicked on a few of those
one day and then i get unlimited
repeated ads and every time i see one of
these things they look beautiful
and i just think you know yeah the
viking cruises in particular and i
looked at them and i think god
of all the things i could do that really
looks like the most appealing one for my
specific sensibilities
and today i learned that
the rivers are drying up in europe
and
the entire
river cruise industry might have to get
shelved
so
that felt like it was about me
somebody says it's for 70 years olds and
up
it's also for people like to write
because i would love to just be able to
sit on the balcony while the scenery is
going by
and you know just finish my book
so
yeah there are times to vacation
actively and then you know there are
times when you don't need to
um
but
we're watching that
and then at the same time europe is
having these gas and electric shortages
so in europe it looks like depending on
the country various countries are
handling it differently because the
energy shortages they're going gonna
have cold showers
some places they won't be able to turn
on the business lights at night it's for
some hours they won't be able to have
open doors with the ac on which probably
is a good idea
and
um
and in california
i got a call from my local energy
company asking me
if the energy company could control my
ac in my house
to turn it off uh when they have the
load balancing issues
that's right
my p my pg the energy company in
california called me home
and says can we stick some technology to
your
your house
so we can turn off your ac if we need to
now
they did say
they did say let me be clear that it
would be for 15 minute periods
in which they would keep circulating the
air so you'd still be circulating
and they said you should experience
maybe a two degree increase in
temperature
before it kicks back on again
now if that's what it did that wouldn't
be too bad
would it
if they could really deliver that
if they could you know keep the lights
on everywhere they need to be kept on
and all you had to do was
maybe twice a day on the hottest days
you set your temperature is 75
for 15 minutes it goes up to 77
you know you go you go shopping for
those 15 minutes
you come back it's already down to 75
you're fine
no big deal right it's a reasonable
thing to ask
is it
because once they can control your ac
do you think they're going to stop with
15 minutes
they say they would
say they would
but i immediately said no and i didn't
say no because i didn't want to be a
team player
i said no because it's just
too much control over my life and also i
work at home and i need a certain
temperature and i don't want people
controlling it for me
yeah
slippery slope
all right
there was a surge in cartel violence in
tijuana unless hundreds of national
guard got called up
to quell a bunch of violence and
murders and stuff in tijuana
and
the the cartel that owns tijuana
they said they were going to respond to
it by killing any citizens who
went outdoors
the cartel
just threatened threatened that if i
guess some some of their members got
imprisoned by the
by the military action and they said if
they don't get their people back
they'll kill everybody who
goes outdoors
so
let me ask you this
the first time you heard me say
let's drone the cartels
what was your first reaction
why can't it happen
i mean sounds nice
talking tough
but it can't actually happen
and then you heard that trump had
brought up the subject during his term
and he had been sort of you know scoffed
at and dismissed no you can't attack no
no you can't attack mexico
what do you think now
what do you think now
now i think that the odds of it
happening are 50 50.
what do you say
if you asked me two years ago the odds
of droning the cartels i'd say really
low
five percent tops right
no more than five percent what do you
say now
what would you give the odds of the us
taking direct military action against
cartel assets in mexico go give me the
odds
give me your odds
i needed a percentage
25 25 100 60 40. i'm reading some of
these off now 65 25 50 00 10
25 35 70 100 0.
all right so we're all over the board
we're from zero to 100
but there are a lot of people in that
middle zone now aren't they
so how many times
how many times have
you seen this pattern emerge
that when i take a position
the
the issue itself seems to be moving at
about the same time
and have you ever wondered am i just
good at finding a parade that's already
moving
or am i moving the parade
have you ever asked yourself that
what do you think in this case
because i'm i'm positive
that public opinion about attacking
mexico has directly followed
my lead
but is it a lead or am i following
what do you think am i leading or
following is it just obvious that this
is the question we should be asking and
other people would be asking at the same
time if i didn't exist it'd be exactly
the same what do you think
well here's the thing i can't tell so i
don't know the answer this question
myself i'll tell you what i do know
i do know that
um members of the government pay
attention to me
can anybody confirm that because that's
the sort of thing i'd rather see you say
it
because if i just say it
doesn't sound differently it sounds
different
but can you confirm that from your own
observation would you say that
somebody is watching
all right so on locals they're they're
saying yes and i see some yeses over
here
so
i don't know could be a coincidence but
here's what i think happened
there are some ideas that you can't
entertain
until somebody's normalized them
and that's what i did
intentionally
i took the wildest idea
attacking mexico
and i set it
until it was normalized
that's what i did
now if all you have to do is say it in a
in a reasonable voice and say it often
and people will get used to hearing it
and then they'll think well
i know it's not impossible
right that's all it is so that the the
persuasion that i used was to normalize
through exposure
a very common
easy to predict method
because you can get used this is
something my mother used to say
you can get used to anything
if you do it long enough
including hanging
if you get hung
you'll get used to it if you do it long
enough
right so that was the joke
but the idea of directly attacking the
cartels
is unimaginable until people are talking
about it and then you go well people are
talking about it
i guess it's not so unimaginable
so that's where we are
we're talking about it
um tick tock
i saw a thread by bowtied robin on
on twitter
talking about how uh tick-tock presents
different content to americans than it
does chinese youth
uh oh
do you see any problems
so tick duck a chinese company
we i guess we know this this is not a
guess
presents very different information to
youth in china than it does to americans
what do you think it gives to chinese
youth that's different from americans
what would you guess
well they give
american youth useless people dancing
and they addict them to it
so they make american use they addict
them to useless nonsense that doesn't
help them and probably hurts their
health
what they do to chinese use is they
the algorithm feeds them valuable life
skills
just think about that
china is feeding valuable life skills
to chinese consumers of tick tock
and they're they're
feeding useless throttle
to americans and everybody else i guess
which teaches them nothing and actually
removes their ability to have critical
thinking
and turns them into just puppets
basically
now
now let me say something that just seems
shocking to you
tick tock is not banned in america
what
do how many of you remember the first
time i said tick tock should be banned
in america does anybody remember that
what happened the first time you heard
it
first time you heard it you said that's
a little too far
right
and then i said it a few more times i
said it more a few more times
and then you heard you probably heard
that the trump
administration wanted to ban tick tock
right
and then i guess
it didn't happen and the biden
administration doesn't seem to be on
that on that track
but it doesn't sound crazy does it
banning tick tock if you if you know
anybody who uses it
um you know what it's doing to them
now let me make a confession i don't use
to tick doc and the reason is it's a
chinese company
i know it would be maybe good for my
business you know raise exposure
introduce myself to a new generation all
that but i'm not going to use it because
of the chinese connection
um
but
i have been consuming accidentally
um
instagram reels
now if you don't use instagram uh let me
explain a reel is a quick little video
that's basically what tick-tock is so
instagram has within it a feature that
mimics everything you tic-tac does
and it's a popular feature
and i made the mistake of
clicking on some reels
in in instagram i don't know some time
ago
and i flipped through and
maybe one out of five was kind of cool
i liked it gave me a little dopa being
hit four out of five were annoying
people
dancing
there's nothing more annoying than a
reel
in which the woman acts cute and then
she has to do a self-conscious uh laugh
at the screen
i can't stand it
so you know what i mean it's the woman's
dancing and
after she does the dance
then or she's or she's looking pretty
and she's just walking and then after
she's walking pretty she does the look
at the camera
this one
and turn off the camera
because i'm so self-conscious i i wasn't
trying to look pretty
no no you might have thought i was
looking pretty bad no no no i'm not
freddie don't stop it stop at i'm not
ready
i can't stand it
i see those things and if i accidentally
have the sound on
now there's one that's worse
because people use these voiceovers that
they could that they pair with their own
video
have you heard this one
i love my puppy dogs my puppy dogs
has anybody you've heard that one right
and once you click on one of those you
just keep getting it
now my puppy dog my favorite dog is
anyway
so here's my point do you know how
addiction works
it's not the way you think
addiction is not getting what you want
addiction is getting what you want
occasionally
that's what makes you addicted so if you
look at four reels
let's say let's say you look at five
reels
one of them is awesome and you love it
and the other four you wish you hadn't
seen
you will become addicted
better than if you liked all five
if you liked all five you just get used
to them
then
you'd be i had enough of that but
because you have to hunt for them you
have to work for it
and you're getting all these false ones
and bad ones before you get one that
just moves you
that's addiction
now
i started using the reels i don't know a
few months ago
and i found myself
taken over
right now it might be because i i study
this real you know all my life
brainwashing and hypnosis and persuasion
i'm kind of really tuned in
to that you know part of life
i could feel my brain being taken over
i could feel my body
no longer being able to stop doing it
i have the actual feeling of i can't
even stop my finger i would like to go
like
that's pretty funny
i would like to be doing something
oh that's that's not funny that's not
funny listen i wish i were
well that's funny
have you had that experience yet
has anybody experienced actually having
their body taken over
because that's a total takeover from my
body
yeah
yeah now twitter does the same thing but
i rationalize it as
you know
part of my entertainment and also
part of business
if i didn't use twitter for business you
know it's part of connecting with an
audience if i didn't do that i would run
from that thing so fast
like i would not use it for
entertainment
to me it just feels dangerous
right
but for business you do some dangerous
things risk reward blah blah blah
but i can't i can't justify
um
using instagram and just looking at
reels because there's no business
purpose there whatsoever and i can't
stop
yeah slot machine theory exactly
so
the tick tock question about whether
tick tock should be legal in america
is a no brainer
tick tock absolutely should not be legal
it should be shut down
today it's one of the most
dangerous things i should i would also
think that
we should put some kind of limit on
addictive social media
so oh the other the other thing that
chinese social media does tick-tock is
they ban it for certain hours for
certain ages
in china you can't even use the damn
thing during certain hours
that's not true in america
so
when we're watching the chinese
right in front of us
destroy the youth of america and more
than the youth because we're addicted to
it too
destroying america while trying to build
up their own
you know internal capabilities
what side
what side is our government on
who exactly is on the side of keeping
tick tock
tell me
worse worse off history i'm going to
guess that that's being funny
but tell me this
i've heard an argument that uh tick-tock
should be banned have you how many how
many of you have heard the argument that
tick tock should be banned go
you watch the news have you ever heard
the argument that it should
mostly yes's right yes yes yes all right
now
now i'm going to open up the mechanism
again
like we did before about who packed the
boxes
i'm going to open you're going to see
the the mechanism again
who's arguing to keep tick tock legal
name their names
who is arguing to keep tick tock
legal no not big tech
not not big tech in the united states
mitch no
no the answer is no one
now
process that for a moment
there's a strong very strong argument
for banning it very strong
there's nobody on the other side
am i wrong
show me a major politician who's on is
in favor of keeping tick tock legal in
the united states
name one
give me a name of any congressperson
senator anybody
did you know that
did you know that we have an issue in
which there's no disagreement
by anybody who's
willing to show their face
nobody who's willing to say my name is x
i'm a senator and i think tick tock
should stay just the way it is
nobody
think of another topic where there's
nobody on the other side
there are people who maybe haven't
thought about it but there's nobody on
the other side
so you're saying swalwell but that's a
joke right you're saying biden that's a
joke mcconnell that's not true
all right
concentra no
that's not true there's literally nobody
who's made the argument
no you see that see if you hadn't
noticed that that was missing
you wouldn't know what's going on
there's something going on that's
protecting tick tock
that
our news has never looked into
think about that
have you seen uh have you seen the news
look into it on the right
nope
i haven't how about the left
nope
i haven't
so the fact that the the single most
important question about social media in
my opinion
you know you should the low-hanging
fruit is tick-tock because it's a
chinese company if you're talking about
facebook or twitter or you know
instagram those things
those are american companies
so you have to treat the whole situation
differently but a chinese company that's
addicting our youth
that's easy
that one's not a challenge
if we're treating like that like that's
a hard question
there's something else going on
and there's something else going on
could only be one thing
which is
what's the one thing it could only be
chinese influence
what else could it be
you know if somebody wants to come
forward and say oh it's not chinese
influence i have a good argument for it
has to do with like freedom or something
by the way
i just realized what is thomas massey's
opinion on tick tock
so let's ask him that question because
he would be interesting because i think
he's more keep the government out of a
guy
but would he be willing to keep the
government out of a chinese cyber weapon
that's what tick-tock is it's a chinese
cyber weapon
so would he be in favor of it because of
your freedom
letting them employ a digital weapon on
american soil
so let's redefine tik tok as a chinese
cyber weapon
because it's a chinese cyber weapon
and i think it should be regulated by um
by the military
it should be a military regulation not
it should be a homeland security thing
well
give me an interview with the head of
homeland security and have that person
explain why tick tock is still allowed
in the united states all right if we had
if we had anything like a a real news
business either on the right or the left
right fox news
i'm coming at you on this
right fox news is not even close to
giving me the news that i want not even
close right
so
here's what i want fox news to do
give me an interview with the head of
homeland security
about one topic
just one topic tick tock and tell me why
that's not a cyber weapon
and tell me why homeland security should
not be banning that
on security
issues it's an attack on the homeland
so i don't even know the name of the
homeland security person do you can
anybody name who's in charge of homeland
security i'm not sure i ever could but
who is it i mean biden but
majorcas oh you're a smart group
majorcas okay so let's get mayorkus on
an interview and say
defend
defend tick-tock being legal
i would make him defend it
right i wouldn't say give us your
opinion i'd say defend it
defend why we should allow a chinese
cyber weapon to continue to target our
youth go
now what do you think new york is going
to say
um you know freedom
is that is that going to be a defense
yeah they're targeting our youth and we
see it and we know it
but you know freedom
freedom
do you think you'll say that
i don't know
i don't know what majorca would say but
wouldn't you like to see an interview
now
does it seem to you that the topic of my
live stream today is that the news isn't
even close to giving us anything we need
didn't give us anything on the
charlottesville thing
they're not giving us anything on who
packed the boxes just obvious questions
and they're not asking the head of
homeland security if tick tock should be
allowed or banned
people these are the most obvious
questions
in the country
how about this one
what are we going to do in the united
states about a fertilizer shortage
that's a pretty big question
right
who's asking that
so i feel like there needs to be some
kind of new entity
where the public can register the
questions it wants to ask and you could
compare what the what the public wants
to ask let's say they get voted up to
the top
with what the entities are actually
asking
because there's a real difference
between the what the news is asking
and what the public wants them to ask
and that's left and right and i don't
know why
i mean i can speculate and make the
worst assumptions in the world
you know that they're either incompetent
or china owns them or some damn thing
but i'd rather
i'd rather have a real answer
you think that behind the curtain
everybody's colluding
maybe
we'll just use hydroponics
they're still fertilized aren't they
hydroponics are fertilized
all right
um
tractor's burying baby formula and i
didn't say that
apple and google profit from the app
yeah but let's get people on record uh
defending that
takes a lot of fertilizer to create
cattle feed oh that's interesting
uh is somebody arguing that
if we went vegetarian not that that's
practical but if we went vegetarian we'd
have enough fertilizer
i don't know if that's true
i feel like we would have to replace the
beef with growing more vegetables i i
don't buy that i'm not buying that
uh you think the us will fight the ccp
no i don't think so not directly
um
so it seems to be that there's one well
nitrogen is not the only fertilizer
so if nitrogen was the only thing we
needed we'd be in good shape that's not
the problem
yeah manure is
fertilizer
um
are you for boring banning the porn
industry that's interesting i've never
talked about that
how many of you would be in favor of
banning porn
let me give you answers i'm saying no no
no yes
yes no yes no
no yes yes no
see the problem with banning porn
people are mixed looks like you're
pretty mixed on this
should be paid access
i don't know
i'm not sure you could ever stop it from
being freely available to children
should be banned um i'm a little
see here my problem with the
porn
is my problem with guns it goes like
this
with guns there it is unambiguously true
that some people are less safe when
there are more guns around
but it is also unambiguously true that
some people
are more safe
if they have access to guns
so the problem with gun ownership is
that we have people who are operating
from self-interest
doing this sort of theater
where they pretend they're arguing from
some social or constitutional right it's
never that
if you think you need a gun or you might
would need one to protect yourself
you want the right to own one if you
think you'll never want a gun because
you're afraid of them and your only risk
is other people having them then
probably you're against it and then we
act as though the theater of the the
high level
oh my constitution that's really why
you're doing it that's not why you're
doing it
you're doing it because you want a gun
or you don't want a gun that's it
right
now you might want a gun to protect
yourself against your government but
it's still just wanting a gun
to feel that you're safer
so
the same thing with porn
if you say porn should be banned
what does that do to the person who
can't get access to humans
is that fair
because if you're if you're looking at
porn from the perspective of someone who
can get sex in the real world
that's not fair
that's not fair at all
if you're married and you're you know
you're getting everything you like and
you're telling me that you know not me
but you're telling somebody else that
they can't have porn
because your sex life is good
well
the only thing i could say is an ironic
 you
it's ironic because they're having sex
yeah no don't don't tell people who
can't get sex that they can't have porn
if you can fix it so they can have sex
well then maybe your opinion that they
should have porn is something i'd listen
to
but until most people can have access to
sex in some kind of a
you know timely useful way which is not
even close to where we are
i think you got to give people options
now is it true that porn ruins marriages
i don't know
i'll tell you what they do
it changes the balance of power
so i believe that marriages stay
together when the woman has all the
power
meaning that she can control the man
completely
that's your stable situation
as soon as the band discovers that he
can get off without the the wife
with porn
suddenly her power diminishes
and he doesn't need to listen to her so
much because
he's not getting sex there anyway
so
i think
porn changes the balance of power in a
way that's very bad for women
it might be bad for men too that would
be a separate question
but
uh i think women want to band because
this definitely reduces their power and
it increases the power of men because
they have an option that doesn't require
being nice to women to get sex
and that's a very big thing
and men don't say that out loud by the
way
but porn is the substitute for shitty
women
sorry
porn is the direct substitute for shitty
women and the percentage of shitty women
is at an all-time high
now you might say to me scott the
percentage of shitty men is at all
all-time high and i don't know
might be
i wouldn't deny it
but it's absolutely true that the
percentage of women who are shitty is at
the whole all-time high
probably true for men maybe it's just
true for people i don't know
but i don't you know my
my vision on this is sort of limited so
i'll admit that
but it's true and and here's why
everybody is getting too picky about
everything
right
too picky about everything
imagine being my age and finding you
know somebody who's within uh 35 years
of dating age i like to have a broad
range
imagine me finding anybody within 35
years of my dating age
who doesn't have so many preferences
that it's really hard
to manage them at the same time
imagine that
so
somebody says lots of men are weaker and
feminized now yeah there is something to
that i don't know what it is
shut up bart
now when i say oh no
uh would i say that everybody's too
picky
i don't mean just women
i mean people and i think it's because
we have so many things that we can
access
have you ever tried to watch a
tv or movie with another person
here's me trying to watch a movie
with another person in
1986
right
this is my impression of wanting to
watch a movie with another person in
1986. hey you want to go to see a movie
sure
what's playing yeah we've got uh three
choices
yeah they all sound pretty good
why don't you pick one yeah all right
we'll probably watch all three but let's
watch this one today okay
and then you get some popcorn and you
maybe you hug
curl up watch a great show
that's 1986.
now here is uh
2022 trying to get somebody to watch a
show
hey you want to watch a movie
i don't know is there anything out
yeah there's tons of movies out uh
so many it's going to be hard for us to
find one that we agree on how about how
about this new thor movie
oh yeah that was great i just watched it
on my phone oh okay
well how about um
top gun
top gun that we all agree on top gun
right yeah yeah
just saw
it all right
two hours later
you've picked a movie
and you watch it
and it's way too boring because your
attention span has changed and you can't
even tolerate it one of you will bail
out of the movie before it's over
when was the last time you sat down with
one other person
to watch a movie and one of you didn't
want to bail out of the movie before it
was over
in the old days i used to watch the
whole movie even if it wasn't perfect
and i didn't care that much
but today i will bail out a movie uh
the moment somebody's tied to a chair
or or an is endangered
so i have two hard rules
of turning off the shell
if somebody's tied to a chair
or there's an animal in danger in any
way
the other times that then there's a
bunch of times that i have to fast
forward
so as soon as there's the male and the
female usually um in the traditional
movie the male and female are like
getting together and they're showing
love for each other
and you know that the next 10 minutes of
your movie
will be you being convinced that they're
really in love so that when something
bad happens you'll feel bad
and i say to myself
having sex got it got it got it got it
done
i can't even watch a movie without fast
forwarding through all the scenes that
are establishing something that i
already got
uh it's a dangerous situation got it
fast forward fast forward you get a
torture for information
you can have a conversation with that
that
confidential source
got it got some information that'll tell
you where to go
don't need to know the rest there you
are
uh you found the guy and it looks like
there's a bunch of bad people in the
room oh there's one hero and a
bunch of bad people in the room i wonder
what's going to happen could it be a
fight
would it be a fight
yes it's a fight will the hero
beat up all the people in the room
fast forward heroes beating up the
people in the room and the action is so
fast i can't really see it anyway it's
just going to be a bunch of images on
the screen for a bunch of minutes and
noise and okay that's over
how do you watch a movie anymore
if you're watching by yourself don't you
fast forward through all the got it i
got it i got it
seeds
right
and
is there anybody who can watch an entire
porn movie before it gets to the good
parts
i mean those were always interminable i
mean just you couldn't handle them
but now it's impossible like what would
be the point if i'm not looking at a
compilation clip i'm already bored
and here i'm talking about that one time
i looked at porn for 10 minutes
yeah 10 minutes and i it was ruined for
life
but yeah
compilation clips it's all i could
handle
[Laughter]
all right
i think that's all uh the audio is okay
now did i lose my audio when i said
something
you didn't like
all right that's enough for now
uh move hands from the face
you know lie my hands in front of my
face
is that bothering you
does it bother you when my hands are
around my
hips i'm sorry
all right you're right i should not put
my hands in front of my face
that's actually good advice
i appreciate it
yeah and the the other problem with uh
movies is the wokeness
uh
i don't mind i remember there was a show
called
something
la femme nikita or something where
nikita played a
woman who weighed about 90 pounds and
could beat up any 200-pound man and
throw him around the room and stuff i
remember thinking oh that's it's like
it's cute because it's so ridiculous
and she was attractive so i didn't mind
looking at it
but
once that becomes the standard way of
all movies
that a 90 pound woman can beat up a 200
pound band pretty much with ease anytime
they want
then it's like
i don't know i think i thought you took
an interesting concept where there was
you know a movie where it was true where
i'm like okay there's a movie where it's
true and then suddenly all movies have
to be true that the women could beat up
the
man went too far
wasn't she enhanced i don't think so
she was just trained well right
all right i have to read this comment
to youtube over on locals
somebody said
[Laughter]
somebody said is there any porn for old
people or does it accidentally turn into
a snuff film
[Laughter]
that's really funny
[Laughter]
i think that's where we're going to end
because i can't top that
port about old people accidentally turns
into a snow film
[Laughter]
that's too close to home
all right youtube that's all for today
i'll talk to you tomorrow
