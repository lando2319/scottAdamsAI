hey everybody come on in
come on in you made it to the right
place
the best place of all the places you
could be
in the virtual world you found the best
one
a pretty darn good so congratulations to
you
for having a morning that's starting out
with
success if you'd like to keep the string
of successes going
and i know you do all you need is a
copper marker glass a tanker tells your
steiner canteen drug or flask a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
except the temperature in texas it's
called the
simultaneous hip and it's going to
happen now go
i was wrong again it's actually getting
warmer in texas
after one sip one sip and it's already
getting warmer in texas
can you believe it i know i know
it's amazing well let me tell you about
the
coolest news
i don't know why this news uh just
really speaks to me
but there's something about this story
that i just love
so there was a company that uh repaired
gondolas you know the little uh enclosed
car that you you take up a ski slope on
the uh
on the ski lift kind of thing so they
they repaired
gondolas and at one point
for no particular uh plan they decided
to start buying up uh gondolas
in case there was ever a reason to use
them for something
that's right there was a company in the
united states
who was buying up a used gondolas
just in case they come up with some
reason to use them
and then the pandemic hit and then they
turned them into out newer dining
pods and they're the coolest freaking
thing you've ever seen
how much would you like to eat
in a gondola that just happens to be
like on a city street
pretty good it's pretty good now when
the gondola is enclosed
you better be with the people that
you've been um
socially isolating with and i can't i
don't know how easy
it is to clean them between customers
but
yeah look people just love that there's
something about the idea that's just
i don't know it just speaks to us
somehow but the best part of the story
is is somebody was buying up
gondolas just in case they were needed
but they hadn't figured out what to do
with them yet
i mean you you can have the best plans
and ideas all day long but if you don't
have luck
you probably don't have a successful
business and talk about luck or
instinct maybe it was not luck maybe it
was some kind of a
hunch that it was likely that they would
be used and
they were right over in india the
infection rate
and especially the hospitalizations have
plummeted
plummeted i tell you yes india
is having for reasons that nobody quite
understands and that's the key to this
the story
they don't know why coronavirus
just plunged in terms of infections and
hospitalizations
now i know what you're going to say
you're going to say because they're
secretly using a different drug like
hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin
or remdezvir or something so you're
thinking to yourself that the real story
is that they're treating it better but
not according to india
india is not saying yes we're having
good success
because we treat it differently and you
know they would
right if india were doing something that
that is somehow different and it had
this gigantic it's a really big effect
like the infections just dropped like a
rock
if they were doing that intentionally
because they did something different
than other people are doing
we would know about that right we would
know
and they don't know so india themselves
doesn't know
why things just turn positive now what
does that tell you about
our total scientific understanding
of the coronavirus because they're not
the only ones that are showing
a sudden drop apparently there are other
the united states is actually having um
a good time
at the moment nobody knows why
yeah here it is it didn't take long for
somebody to say hydroxychloroquine
is used in india that is not the reason
independent of whether
hydroxychloroquine works or doesn't work
and i think the evidence suggests it
doesn't
at this point early on i think you could
have called it a good risk management
decision to try it
because the downside was so low but at
this point
we wouldn't know if it worked
there's no way we wouldn't know by now
so i think you have to assume it doesn't
work or doesn't work in a big way
but in any event if if india were using
it
and it worked and it was getting this
big result we would have seen the result
a long time ago because they've been
using it for a while
and secondly they would tell us they'd
say oh this is the reason
it's it's obvious wherever we give this
we get good results
so it's not the hydroxyl chloroquine
i you know i can't prove that but it
seems
obviously it's not because it's also
not anything else
everything that you say about india that
makes it special is irrelevant
because it's not the only place it's
happening all right
so as soon as you're saying to yourself
what's different about india
you're already on the wrong page because
it's happening here too
and it's happening in europe nobody
knows why and it's not the vaccinations
because there are not enough of them to
get this kind of a result
so and here's something that
people mentioned to me every now and
then apparently the spanish flu
also had an unexplained dip or more than
one i think there might have been more
than one unexplained dip
so we don't know why the spanish flu
exactly went away
do we i don't think we know i don't
think it was heard immunity
i think it just sort of went away and
this is telling me that there's some
gigantic variable
about this virus that we don't
understand
if i had to guess it goes like this
and i think well this is not my guess i
think somebody else said this and i just
read it somewhere
but it sounded right my guess is that
there
that certain people are just more
susceptible
so if you take a population of 100
million
there might be 10 million who could ever
get it
and then they do and then the other 90
billion or ones that
wouldn't have gotten it wouldn't have
spread it would not have had bad
symptoms
had some natural immunity so we we make
the assumption that
all humans are sort of equally you know
likely to get this thing
it's maybe that's just not true maybe
there's just a small population that
could be affected and once you blow
through
70 of them maybe it slows down
maybe i'm just guessing so somebody says
it's the god variable
hey i don't have a better idea
so every time you say uh follow the
science i'm going to say
how come the science doesn't know why
the virus is decreasing
how do you follow the science exactly
what would i be doing
differently if i follow the science
all right um i have a suggestion
that everyone who donated to the lincoln
project
they need to get one of those
conservatorships like britney spears has
you know britney spears isn't allowed to
handle her own money
because the thought is people would try
to take advantage of her so her father
and now
some professional third party is going
to work to handle britney spears
money but i feel as though anybody who
donated to the lincoln project
might need a little help might need a
little help identifying scams
because rob reiner for example i
understand gave money to the lincoln
project
i don't know how happy he is about that
investment
somebody said hey but they said they
would beat trump and trump lost so
it was still a good investment to which
i say there was a study that showed it
made no difference and
they only spent a minority of their
funds
on the advertisement now we don't know
where the rest of it went
which makes me want to start my own
political action committee
because if you can get massive donations
and you don't have to report what you're
doing with it
well that's a pretty good job i thought
i had a good job
i mean i do i my job's pretty good
most people would trade places with me
be a cartoonist draw a few little stupid
comics make a living
yeah you would all do that if you could
but you know what's a better job
yeah being on the lincoln project having
people give you massive amounts of money
and then just keeping it that's way
better than my job
that's how you get that generational
wealth that steve schmidt
allegedly talked about he was getting
from the project
but how can you how can you argue that
the people who donated to it need a
little help
because they they put money into a grift
they didn't know it if they had asked me
ahead of time scott do you think this is
a good place to put our money
i would have said um
no how about
no it's not a good place to put your
money so i could be the conservator
for uh for rob reiner i could i could
have helped him avoid that problem
i'm here to help here is a really
interesting story
allegedly trump's uh lawyer
shone s-c-h-o-e-n he's the one who
debunked
the fine people hoax at the uh the
failed impeachment
the failed peachman and we found out
that he
only found out the fine people thing was
a hoax
the same day he was preparing his
defense
was the first time he knew
that the fine people thing was a hoax
because of the way it was edited
that was the first time he knew
just let just absorb that for a moment
just sit there and think about that
how well-informed is somebody operating
at this level
in society really well-informed
wouldn't you say don't you think that
any of the attorneys
that you saw defending or trying to
prosecute the president
wouldn't you say it's fair to say
they're all really well informed
about the news and world events i think
that's fair to say
very well informed he found out
that the biggest story in the whole
freaking country
was a hoax that day
that day he found out now
how do you find out
how do you find out that day
was there anybody who was making a lot
of noise
that day yeah you know i was one of them
but you know joel steve cortez i
think
greg guffeld was mentioning it so if
anybody was
uh and i know don jr tweeted at least
one of my tweets on it
so i know that that at least social
media
was trying to correct that story i know
that in at least
the case of don jr there was a direct
connection to the you know the people
who needed to know
i feel like i feel like we did that
i feel like we did that when i say we i
mean that includes all of you
so it's not just you know joel and steve
and greg and
what i did it's not it's not just us
without without those being boosted
and retweeted it doesn't go anywhere so
thank you thank you
thank you to all of you who retweeted
any of that content
you actually made a difference you know
it's you know you don't see many
situations where you can trace
i think you can i mean you could be we
could be wrong right
it could be that he got it from some
other source or he just looked at the
video himself
and realized what happened that's
possible too but i think it's more
likely
that all of the noise on the internet
penetrated
that bubble wouldn't you think if it
feels like
it feels like we made a difference so
if you watch these um these live streams
and you say to yourself what difference
does it make
well maybe this is an example i don't
know for sure no way to prove it
but it feels like it it feels like it
feels like we made a difference so
congratulations
on that
let's talk about all the fake news
uh starting with this have you seen on
the internet there's a video of a
helicopter
de-icing windmills and the
the joke on the meme that's going around
is that the helicopter of course is you
know powered by fossil fuels and
i guess the de-icing stuff is actually
made from fossil fuels
and then they're pouring it on uh a
windmill
that was made by fossil fuels
now the purpose of this meme of course
is to show how ridiculous
and uneconomical windmills are and damn
it
all the problems in texas are because
these windmills
uh got iced and stopped working is that
the news that you
that you saw how many how many of you
think that the following statement is
accurate
that there are millions of people who
don't have power
in texas during this cold snap because
the windmills got frozen and stopped
working
in the comments how many of you think
that is an accurate
true statement of the news
that millions of people are without
power in texas
because the windmills in particular
froze that's everything you're seeing
right
on the internet that's what you're
saying is it true
no it's not true
it's not true what's true is
that all of the power sources had
problems
the wind the the wind had problems
the gas production had power had
problems because something in that
flow froze as well it wasn't just the
windmills
it was the whole the whole grid
and every way that they produce
electricity was impacted
because ship froze that wasn't supposed
to fro to freeze
and nothing was hardened against it now
i first
learned of this from a green promoter
uh keaton joshie if i'm pronouncing it
right
on twitter and he said this is a
straight up lie
that's guaranteed to go viral talking
about the helicopter
de-icing the windmill he goes whether
it's from climate deniers or from people
who think you can just reduce demand
the picture is from a test of a
helicopter
de-icing system in 2016.
that picture of the helicopter de-icing
a windmill
fake it's from 2016.
it has nothing to do with texas and
here's the second part
modern turbines in sub-zero climates
have inbuilt
de-icing systems
wait a minute that's fake news on top of
fake news
did you catch it did you did you catch
the clever
fake news on top of the fake news so
keaton is saying it's fake news
that these windmills need this kind of
external de-icing
because quote i'll read his his exact
words
modern turbine turbines in sub-zero
climates
does that describe texas is texas a
sub-zero climate in your mind
do you think that the texas windmills
have internal uh de-icing systems
and were they all installed after 2016
 no no do you do you have to be
an expert to know that this is a lie
or incorrect i won't say a lie no
it's obviously fake so it's fake news
that the
helicopter was de-icing the windmills
it's fake news that the windmills were
the main source of the power loss it was
all the different power losses
all the different power sources and this
guy who is calling out the fake news
added his own fake news on top of the
fake news
that texas would be expected to have a
internal de-icing systems
which would suggest that their windmills
were placed in the last five years
seems unlikely seems unlikely i mean
some of them sure
or that they th that when they were
installed they
included the de-icing technology
because i don't know that texas would
have been considered
a sub-zero climate right
now fact-check me on that fact check me
on that because i
i may have something wrong but i'm
pretty sure that it was
a fake news that got debunked
by more fake news the truth as far as i
can tell is that these
texas windmills probably did not all
have de-icing
built in probably did need some external
help
or just weight i guess and it included
the other
you know gas and other sources somebody
mentioned nuclear but that would only be
if there was something in the the
transmission part of it after the energy
was created
which is possible all right here's
another
fake news this one from axios
and then boosted by fox news
now how many of you remember that i
predicted
i've been saying this for years actually
that most
fake news comes from whichever news
group is out of uh out of office
so that when you've got a clint let's
say a bill clinton in an office you'll
get
more fake news from say fox news if
you've got a trump in office you'll get
more
fake news from cnn so it's the
opposition that creates
most of the fake news so i predicted
that with biden in office you would see
more fake news from
the right it's a little too early to
know that i'm right but here's an
example of it
all right so and
when you see how you've been fooled it
will give you a little bit of empathy
for how easily the the viewers of cnn
are being fooled
because if you watched cnn or you saw
this tweet
or you watched axios you saw fake news
and here's the fake news
um according to
axios
they reported in a tweet that harris
said there was quote
there was no national strategy or plan
for vaccinations
and quote we're starting from scratch
so that the we're starting from scratch
bart
gets pulled out and then they fact check
it
uh are we really starting from scratch
with vaccines
and then they go to fauci's uh claim
much earlier that we were not starting
from scratch
all right so the reporting is that
harris says we were starting from
scratch
here's the exact quote in the tweet
we're starting from scratch
we're starting from scratch that's very
clear right if she said
the vaccination program is we're
starting from scratch
we have fouchy denying it and also
common sense denying it
you can observe you don't even need to
check the news
you and i observe they're not starting
from scratch
that's clearly fake right
but did kamala harris actually say that
did kamala harris say what axios reports
and fox news boosted
we're starting from scratch is that a
true quote
no it's fake news do you know
how they created the fake news
they cut off the rest of what she said
have you ever heard of this trick before
that's what brought you the find people
hoax
they cut off the rest of the context do
you know how you got the
covington kids hoax they cut out the
context you know how you got the
president wants you to drink
bleach hoax they cut out the context
and how did this one get created they
cut out the context
so it's not the other side that's giving
you fake news
it's all of them it's all of them
giving you fake news here is the real
quote
um she said there was no stockpile of
vaccines
harris responded when she was asked
about this by axios
she said there was no national strategy
or plan for vaccinations
we were leaving it to the states and
local leaders to try and figure it out
and so in many ways that's the part that
they left out
in many ways we're starting from scratch
on something that's been raging for
almost an entire year
now if you take out the part in so many
ways
and you turn it into an absolute we're
starting from scratch
you've changed something that was
reasonable and true
and even gave an example she gave the
specific example
that under trump the states were
responsible for the distribution
and what they're doing is making it a
national strategy
the national strategy did not exist so
they started from scratch
and when asked she said in many ways and
i would say that would be many ways
starting from scratch for a national
strategy whether you think it's a good
idea or a bad idea separate
but i would i would rate her statement
completely true
absolutely unambiguously completely
accurate and true
that in many ways we're starting from
scratch
because she just gave you a gigantic
example and that
clearly qualifies as something they're
starting from scratch now keep in mind
that she's speaking as a politician so
there's a little
there's a little spin and hyperbole on
this right
to say that they're starting from
scratches and maybe a little bit of an
exaggeration
but she gave you a specific example that
is true
there was not a national strategy they
created one from scratch
so in many ways they were starting from
scratch
all right now if you change that to an
absolute
we started from scratch it's a lie if
you show the context it's totally true
and reasonable
now i'm looking at your comments and
people are just throwing up on this
because when cognitive dissonance
happens to you
it doesn't feel like cognitive
dissonance does it
it feels like i'm lying or i'm
misinterpreting it or
so so your brains are now trying to
figure out how you could have been right
all along when it's obvious you weren't
right
all right some of you are going through
that right now so you're having some
cognitive dissonance
you have been duped by fake news if you
believe if you ever believed
this story you were duped by fake news
it happens to the best of us
don't don't feel like there's something
wrong with you there's nothing wrong
with you
i was duped by the fake news about the
the windmills just this morning
we're all getting duped by fake news and
it's coming from the left and the right
if you don't get that it's coming from
both sides
you're going to be stuck at a lower
level of awareness
right the lower level of awareness is
the other side is lying
but my side isn't that's not the world
you're living in
you're not living in that world come up
to the new world
both sides are lying all the time all
the time
once you get there everything starts
making sense but as soon as you're
thinking i think it's the other side
that's lying
you're going to be really confused
because the the news won't make sense
as soon as you realize both sides are
lying it starts making sense
all right
here's another one
um let's see uh john avlon
at cnn he's my favorite troll because he
doesn't even look like a human
when i see him he has this weird uh
like demon smile that
i've told you before that once you see
somebody's animal you can't unsee it
but he he registers as a demon to me
meaning when i see him i think he would
be a good actor
to play a demon who just came from a
portal from hell
and he wouldn't even have to act he
would just have to keep that same
expression
because he's he's happy but evil
like it's hard to pull off happy and
evil at the same time because he's got a
genuine smile
with a little medieval there's something
going on there that's not quite right
i don't know what it is so john avalon
he's an opinion person for
cnn and he was going through what he
calls the
the lies from the trump uh
um impeachment team now
are you aware that the trump lawyers
told any lies
did your news tell you that they got
anything wrong
now i'm not aware of anything they got
wrong but i'll give you john
avalon's example now watch this
example and if you get my point
it's going to blow you away
here's my point the fake news is so
strong now
that they can do this
i'm not holding a pen in my hand
now if you're listening to this on uh
just audio
i'm holding a pen up to the to the video
here
clearly obviously there's a pen in my
hand the fake news is now
so strong that they can show you the pen
and say
there's no pen in my hand watch john
avalon do it
on his show he used as an example of the
trump lawyer's lying all right
so this is an example of the trump
lawyers
lying according to john avalon the demon
who came through the portal from hell
and the example he gave was that
he said that the lawyers said that the
president
was not aware that pence was in danger
at a certain point in the timeline
so that's the claim the trump lawyer
said
that trump was not aware of the danger
that trump was in
at a certain point of the timeline
john avalon shows that that's a lie
by showing that before that point there
had been a
tweet or some information i guess some
information not a tweet
that had told the president trump that
pence had been evacuated
and that's what john avalon uses as his
proof
that trump knew that pence was in danger
watch this i'm not holding a pen in my
hand
i'm not holding a pen now watch john
avalon do the same trick
pence was evacuated
do you evacuate people to danger
is that how the word is used we're
evacuating him from safety
to danger or does
we evacuated him tell president trump
that he's safe because what do you
evacuate people
to don't you evacuate them to
safety so avalon is proving that the
trump lawyers
lied by showing you
that they didn't and proving it
and then telling you that the thing
you're looking at that proves they
didn't lie
and that trump's first understanding of
what was going on
was that pence was safe
evacuated to safety
and avalon showed this pen to you and
said there's no pen in my hand
and 95 percent of the people who watched
it
didn't see the pen and if i hadn't
explained it to you
most of you wouldn't have seen the pen
just think about that just think at the
level
that the brainwashing has reached they
can show you
that they're lying tell you that they're
not
and you'll believe the telling part
instead of your own
 eyes that just happened
that just happened in the real world
that just happened
now if i had told you a year ago that
this was possible
how many of you would have said yeah
that seems possible
not many of you if you had studied
hypnosis
and i told you that this was possible
would you have believed it
yeah you would have you totally would
have because within the realm of people
who study
hypnosis and persuasion this is kind of
routine
there's no pen in my hand but when you
see it
you leave that world of uh let's say
uh hypnosis and stage hypnosis and it
enters the actual real world of
news and politics
you have something to worry about there
that's something to worry about
all right so i guess uh
i'll give cnn a compliment uh while i'm
at it
i've told you before that it's a it's a
good
it's a good strategy for uh monitor
moderating your bias we can't get rid of
our bias but you can
maybe do as well as you can to moderate
it a little bit
is to see if you can find something good
to say
about whatever or whoever you're
criticizing
so i'm going to say something good about
cnn when they do
content that is not the news they're
really good at it
there's specials about historical
specials and
their specials about you know the
country during a certain era
and stuff like that it's really good
stuff and some of their other reporting
just about
things that are not political also
pretty good
i recommend them and i've told you i
like fareed zacario show it's very good
um and some others smirkownish
smurfgarnish great show
he does a good job and he's the most
unbiased person on the network
so here's another compliment they've got
a story here about
revenge bedtime procrastination so it's
just a
sort of interesting piece have you heard
of this revenge
bedtime procrastination it's sort of
misnamed
it has to do with the fact that we're
all working hard at home
or many of us are and if you work all
day and you've used up your day and
you've done nothing but
been in your house you've been in social
isolation
you just don't have enough stimulation
and you go to bed
and it's your bedtime and you should go
to sleep but you haven't had enough
fun today and so you just can't
because you need some amount of pleasure
entertainment
distraction you just need it every day
and so people will stay up way too late
to steal a few hours of
not having to work and just looking
through their phone or whatever and then
they don't get enough sleep
so apparently this is some kind of
national problem
which i totally believe because i'm
feeling it myself
during the pandemic is the first time i
personally
have ever done this which is go to bed
when it's already time to go to sleep
and instead of going to sleep i'll watch
a show on my phone and
fall asleep to that instead i never did
that before
and it's i think i think i'm also
suffering from the revenge bedtime
procrastination
because i you know i can't get out into
the real world and
do the interesting things i would like
to so i feel like
this got me too i feel like i'm totally
in this camp
i'm feeling this right now i've done
this every day i'm just looking at your
comments
i'm doing that right now there's
probably somebody in bed watching me
right now
different time zone i watched until a
show until 3 a.m
yeah this is a real thing so compliment
to
cnn this is good content and i
appreciated reading it
and it's worth mentioning they do a good
job in the stuff
i guess there's a town hall with joe
biden of course on cnn because they'll
ask the hard-hitting questions
you know cnn's going to go hard at biden
oh yeah
asking the tough questions for example
we've learned recently that
biden likes to have a fireplace uh the
fireplace going in the oval office
and here's some hard news for you i
don't know if you saw this anywhere
except cnn
but but biden likes to sometimes put a
log on the fire himself
yeah and sometimes he'll play with his
dogs
he's got excellent dogs and he loves his
wife
so that's the sort of hard-hitting
commentary we should expect from this
cnn town hall
i think i'll watch it just to see if
biden falls apart
because i i feel as though cnn
cnn cnn's definitely giving biden a
honeymoon wouldn't you say
and i don't mind that actually i i don't
mind that cnn is giving biden
a honeymoon period where they're they're
just not going that hard
at him although i said jake tapper went
pretty hard
uh very hard at a couple of topics um
on the coronavirus in opening schools
etc so i feel as if cnn
almost has to turn negative on biden
almost has to because their content is
going to require
some friction some controversy and
they're not going to get enough without
trump
the republicans aren't doing anything so
there's nothing to talk about
so they're going to have to go after
biden and
maybe we'll see it at the town hall if
it's watch that and see if you see any
kind of a
shift here's a question for you
does anybody try to keep track and i
don't know that you could possibly track
this
of how many people will be killed by
green
technology because i feel like
there have to be some right if you
assume that climate change is real and i
know some of you are skeptics
but if you assume that for whatever
reason
the climate keeps going in that
direction
bummer
sorry i got distracted when your wife
texts you
you get to check the text right uh
here's a question for you
this is completely off topic but um
how long is appropriate to wait
to respond to a uh text
from your spouse go what is the longest
amount of time
that you would wait to respond to a text
from your own spouse and
now i know obviously sometimes you're in
a meeting or you're driving or something
so you can't respond
but if you're not if you're not
unavailable
what's the longest you would wait
looking at your
three hours somebody says one hour
12 minutes five minutes 22 minutes five
minutes
eight hours okay well you're not going
to stay married for very long
three hours you probably have trouble in
your marriage
one minute or less
well i'm going to respond to christina
there less than five minutes
boom that's how she knows i love her
all right i don't know what i was
talking about here oh how many people
die from green technology
so let's say now uh we i debunked this
earlier but let's say
that part of the problem now i don't
think you can blame the windmills on any
of the deaths
given that the gas and other things also
went out because of the wind i think we
just blamed that on the weather
forget that point but i would like to
know if there's any offset
we probably will over the years start
measuring we probably will start
measuring
how many people die from climate change
but will we measure how many people are
saved by
fossil fuels is there a way to do the
net
if there's not a way to do the net
what are we doing all right
um iran is pushing biden
as of course they are some militia group
associated with iran
fired some uh rockets into
uh in iraq a u.s base in iraq and killed
a foreign contractor and injured several
americans
now what will biden do now that iran
has injured americans
he's got a problem and i don't know if
this will come up in the town hall
because it sounds exactly like the sort
of thing cnn won't ask him
but what is he going to do
isn't biden almost certainly going to
have to act
more like trump did and get tough with
iran
just backed people who attacked people
who injured americans
several americans i don't know how bad
the injuries are
but it feels like he's going to do
nothing
doesn't it it feels like it would iran
have done this if trump were president
feels like no can't be sure
can't be sure but i feel like they'd be
less likely to do it
i feel like they're pushing biden to see
what they can get away with
funny story of the day representative
adam kinzinger
who came out as you know quite
anti-trump
based on the capital assault his own
family uh just
uh so he's he's a republican adam
ginziger
and his own family disowned him for
opposing trump
11 relatives signed a handwritten letter
calling him quote
a disappointment to god and lou dobbs
[Laughter]
11 members of his family say he's a
disappointment to god
and lou dobbs now
i gotta tell you i'm no religious
scholar
it seems to me that disappointing god
a bad thing but disappointing lou dobbs
a lot of you don't know far worse
because while god has his own heaven and
hell
lou dobbs also has a private version
you've heard of private
prisons you know they're public prisons
but then they're also privately run ones
well god has more of a public heaven
sort of a public hell
a lot of you don't know lou dobbs has
sort of a private version of that sort
of a
it costs a little more but you can get
into lou dobbs heaven
or lou dobbs hell and you don't want to
go there
you don't want to be in lou dobbs hell
but lou dobbs heaven i hear is very well
appointed
nice nice design good feng shui
i'm going to look into it lou dobbs
heaven
all right i asked you on my last
uh live stream if anybody could find the
origin
of the democrats saying that trump was
using the quote
big lie about the election being stolen
allegedly and uh
it's harder to to discern than you think
so apparently it's a generic enough
thing that people have been speaking of
the big lie
somewhat consistently for you know
decades
it comes up a lot so it's hard to know
if there was some point where there was
a decision to use it
or if just a lot of people spontaneously
heard somebody else say it and said oh
i'll say that too
so you don't know how much is organized
but we see bloomberg was saying in
september of 2020.
we see that the editor for occupy
democrats you all read that right you're
you're all probably subscribed to that
important publication called
occupy democrats but the editor grant
stern
uh he consistently used the the big lie
as part of his writing through
throughout 2020
so i guess it's been around and we can't
tell exactly
where a decision was made all right
good news and bad news are you ready do
you want the good news first or the bad
news
the good news right all right the good
news first
flying cars finally here
yes for years we've been talking about
flying cars
where's my flying car well a company
named
tara fuego now if you heard of a company
named
terrafuego what what country would you
assume
owned that or at least where do you
think
the uh the origin of that company is do
you think it would be owned by
let's say mexico tara
it sounds like mexico right but i don't
know that mexico has much of an
aeronautic industry so maybe uh
uh brazil or uh
is there some other country in south
america where terrafuego
would be that would be a pretty good
name for a count for a business that
started out of that part of the world
oh but it turns out it's china
that's right china owns the first flying
car
company or at least the first one that
will come to market
so it looks like by 2022 they'll have
all the clearance they need for this
thing
and it's basically a car with fold up
wings
and that you can drive your car to the
airport and then unfold the wings and
take off and then fly to the next
airport fold it up and drive to your
destination
now i happen to be married to a pilot
ha ha you're not married to a pilot and
i am
or some of you are i guess but uh
apparently you need some kind of a sport
license that might be something from
another country i don't know if a sport
license
even makes sense for flying in this
country but
christina my wife has a high performance
what do you call it certification or
sign off or something
so she could actually fly aerobics
planes that are
big engines and hard to land they've got
a different wheel structure
so if you're doing the aerobics planes
you really have to
take a lot of lessons before the first
time you can land it
versus say a cessna that practically
lands itself
it's got a little steering wheel you're
just like
okay cessna land yourself but if you've
got these little
tail wheel aerobic planes that are
coming in with their giant engines
they're coming in
way faster you know to the runway
you need a lot of skill to to grease the
landing as the pilots like to say
christina apparently has that skill so
she could
be a pilot i think for one of these uh
flying cars so
imagine this is actually a thing that
could happen
by next year just think about this this
could literally happen next year
that i could walk downstairs to my
garage
get in my flying car with christina
driving
drive to my local airport which is 10
minutes away
livermore airport drive directly
onto the tarmac contact the tower
put your wings down fly to
san diego fold up the wings
and fly and drive to your hotel
next year that's actually a real thing
that next year you know if i wanted to
buy one of these flying cars
now i of course would not buy a product
from china if if i have any alternatives
so i don't think i'm going to be buying
a flying car
from china but elon musk
if you're listening elon if you make me
a flying car
i'll buy your flying car i'll buy your
flying car
on day one i'm not going to buy a
chinese flying car
and if you do well you got some
explaining
um all right and i guess they can go 100
miles an hour
actually that's not very much is it so
it can fly at speeds of 100 miles an
hour that's really slow
that actually i'm not even sure there's
much point of having an airplane if it
only flies at 100 miles an hour
you kind of want you kind of want 140
160
to have yourself a proper airplane
small plane
and that
is what i wanted to talk about today
all right have i missed any big topics
have i offended anybody have i triggered
anybody into cognitive dissonance
what else can i do for you
yeah as somebody's saying going 100
miles an hour without any traffic
and without the winding of of roads
if you could go 100 miles an hour
directly to your destination
yeah that'd be pretty good but you also
have to
navigate an airport and that stuff
high performance is 160 miles per hour
somebody's saying in the comments that
sounds about right yeah
the the pits p-i-t-t-s i think they'll
go about 160.
all right that's all for now and i will
chinese cannons on islands near japan
what i better look into that i haven't
heard about it
talk to you later
all right uh how is closing the keystone
pipeline supposed to help the planet
somebody asked me
on here well
good question uh you believe the lou
dobbs
fake news yeah that that was fake news
uh the the headline that i read
it was funny fake news so i read it
anyway about uh
the kinsenger relatives saying that uh
they disappointed god and lou dobbs
the headline was actually misleading
they did talk about lou dobbs and they
did talk about disappointing god but
the headline put those two ideas
together
yeah 100 miles an hour with no traffic
is still pretty good deal that's true
i see you thank you for that two dollars
all right
so the other attorney vander ern was a
trump-hating uh democrat
yeah you know i was going to say this in
the live stream that
people don't always understand that
lawyers are not
really working for the client all the
time
meaning that if you're a defense lawyer
on paper you're working for your client
and of course you're going to do
what's in the best interest of the
client but really you're not working for
the client
you're working for the country and for
the constitution
if you're a defense lawyer and that's
why defense lawyers
can so easily defend somebody that's
like an obvious guilty
serial killer or whatever because
they're not defending the client
i mean technically they are and they're
getting paid by the client and they do
have to do what the client
requires them to do within ethical
bounce
but they're not really working for the
client
they're working for the country because
we need a system that
does that somebody's got to do the work
like somebody has to be that lawyer or
the system doesn't work
so i always say when i see like trump's
lawyers
they're personally they probably don't
vote for him
but all all the more to call them
patriots
because if you can be a lawyer who
doesn't like the client and still does a
bang-up job
well that's that's for the benefit of
the country so thank you
so thank you to trump's lawyers who did
a great job for the country
for the constitution and if trump's
happy with them
that's all the better all right
that's all for now and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
