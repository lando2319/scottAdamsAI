[Music]
well
good morning and welcome
to welcome to what welcome you know
the best thing that's ever happened to
you
yeah a lot of people today woke up and
did not come to watch coffee with scott
adams and participate in the
simultaneous sip we pity them
we pity them
because all of you
are going to experience something
special
that's right that's right user
you're going to take it up a notch and
all you need is a copper marker glass
that tanker tells us to iron that
canteen jogger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with the
liquid you like best i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure of the
dope being here today the thing that
makes everything better unless my camera
is in the wrong orientation oh damn it
the camera's in the wrong orientation
i'm going to add that to my checklist
but
join me now for the simultaneous sip
this will make everything except your
screen orientation better
wait it's even improving the screen
orientation
didn't see that coming
turns out we have a solution for that it
was only on locals so
if you're on youtube you didn't see the
difference
all right
much better i don't know if that turned
all of your screens upside down for a
minute
well uh
do you all know kanye west
everybody know who kanye west is that's
a trick question
there's nobody named kanye west he's
changed his name to
just y e
which i think he calls yay
it's not ye right
is it because it's kanye so it's yay
right
yeah he's a pretty good name i i like it
when uh
people who are already super famous uh
make us think about their name change
because it keeps us in their memory
so uh i liked it when prince did it just
because it made us continually talk
about him
and i like it when yay is doing it
okay it's just a good technique it's a
very persuasive thing it's an easy way
to stay in the news
and i think everybody called him yay in
person so it just made sense
but the interesting thing is that he
arrived on a flight
i guess people's on the airport
wearing a
halloween kind of mask
which could be described as white face
could be described as white face it was
a caucasian mask
how do you feel about that
well i love the fact that he did it
because he just does anything that
i mean he he's willing to do things that
grab your attention and they're
provocative and yeah it was funny
uh but the weirdest thing is that he's
reportedly meeting with michael cohen
trump's uh
you know fallen from grace lawyer
what's that all about
what
what is kanye talking to michael cohen
about
does anybody know do you even have a
guess
like what what possible business could
the two of them have
oh divorce yeah
but divorce he's not really a divorce
lawyer
yeah i don't know it's weird um but
maybe we'll find that out
there's a story out of india about a
monkey killing a man by hurling a brick
off a second floor of a building
monkey threw that brick killed that man
isis has already claimed responsibility
but cnn is reporting that it was caused
by climate change
because
there's one thing you know about climate
change it will cause monkeys to start
hurling bricks
if you think this is a one-off
well you haven't watched cnn because
anything that's a little bit
unexpected
means climate change so climate changes
are making monkeys crazy
and they're starting to look for blunt
objects to throw out humans
and they've got their first kill
and an idiot
the true part is the monkey part
the fake part is the climate science
part i made that up if somebody's new
here you might actually think that cnn
reported it was because of climate
change
remember
parity and reality have merged now
so i actually had to step back and say
oh no actually cnn is not reporting that
climate change is causing monkeys to
roll bricks
here's news from the simulation
news from the simulation
it's a low budget operation i have to do
my own
stings
but the news from the simulation
spokane police department
is investigating the origin of the
explicit video an x-rated video
that showed up on screen uh on a new
show in spokane
so i think it was the weather person was
doing the news and suddenly uh an
x-rated scene showed up on the screen
uh here's the simulation part
it was a local news station
whose call letters are k r e m
t v
how do you pronounce that
k r
e m
would you pronounce it
creme
maybe
maybe
maybe creme
or
or
is the simulation messing with us again
is it a coincidence
that the one local news station
that had some porn on it
was cream tv
cream tv
i'm not making this up
i'm just telling you the news
yeah
obviously we live in a simulation
there's no other explanation all right
here's another mystery
so you all know there's uh y'all y'all
know
there's a uh supply chain problem and it
has to do with uh trucking shortages
do you know the reason for the trucking
shortage anybody anybody do you know the
reason for the trucking shortage
well before i tell you the reason for
the trucking shortage
let me give you a
rule of thumb
for knowing a lie from the truth
now here's what i learned from a friend
of mine and i didn't believe it the
first time i heard it
but if you if you follow this rule and
just keep it in mind
watch how often it predicts
not a hundred percent
but it's really predictive and it goes
like this
the truth
usually has one good reason to it
right there are exceptions of course
but if something is true
there's usually one good reason and if
there's more than one good reason
they're usually obvious ones that you
can also see
okay
so
when you have more than one good reason
offered
the more reasons that are offered the
less likely the base story is true
you got that
if there's just one or maybe two if
there are obvious reasons given for an
explanation for a thing probably true or
could be true
but if you have seven explanations for a
thing and they're all different
there's something going on
it means either nobody knows what's
going on
or somebody's lying
right now let's look at the trucking
shortage
what's the one reason for it there isn't
there are multiple reasons
there's some some i saw in the comments
that
truckers don't want to get vaccinated
maybe
there's truckers or too many of them are
on meth they can't pass
or people want to be truckers or can't
pass the drug test maybe
there's something about california
requiring only newer trucks be used for
climate and
and environmental reasons so that there
would be a limit of trucks because
they're not enough new ones
there's a issue of this supplies to fix
the trucks themselves so the supply
chain is broken
but included in that broken supply chain
is the parts
to fix the trucks
that broke the supply chain
so that's another explanation given
so the trucks have to be green we don't
have enough green ones
let's see here's some other reasons uh
truck driving schools not enough of them
they're too slow they're kind of
expensive
uh pete judge pointed out the demand
desire
so we're just because of the pandemic
you know
keeping demand low for a while it's just
a little excess demand
how about low wages and bad treatment of
customers low wages for truck drivers
customers treat them poorly
i mentioned drug testing
in the uk they've got a also a supply
chain problem
and they blame a backlog of truck driver
license requests i guess there are 50
000
people who have applied to be truck
drivers in the uk but they can't get
through
now
what are the odds
given all these different reasons
what are the odds that the uk would be
having a problem at the same time we
would
for a different reason
just think about it what are the odds
there would be a massive supply chain
problem in the united states
with all these different reasons given
and the uk
just coincidentally would also have a
supply chain problem
for a completely different reason
that the democracy can't process them
what's going on
what's going on now somebody says it's
really the same reasons in the uk or
similar
could be
wouldn't rule that out
here's my
here's my take on it i think there's
something we're going to find out about
this story that we don't know
there's something we're going to find
out
that we don't yet know
it could be
that it's just this weird perfect storm
that all these things happened at the
same time and and really the pandemic
was sort of behind most of them
right not all of them but the pandemic
you know exacerbated a thing that was
already maybe on the edge
i would that's believable
could be
but it's happening in the uk same time
they're getting the same perfect storm
and what about other places i don't know
so here's my take on this i think
there's some big ugly secret coming
a big ugly secret coming
because let's just go through the the
reasons given and let me tell you how
compelling or not they are
i believe that in the context of an
emergency it wouldn't be hard to train
new people quickly
how long does it take to learn to drive
a truck
two weeks
two weeks
couldn't you get there in two weeks
i suppose they loosened maybe i don't
know the marijuana condition of the drug
testing i don't know if that's already
happened but suppose they did that just
because it's an emergency
they say all right in the short run
we're gonna lower our standards how
about using trucks that are not as green
temporarily
and then going back to the green trucks
when you can
don't all of these problems look
solvable to you
don't they
there are a whole bunch of problems but
they all fall in that category of
they look really solvable
but they don't look like they're getting
solved
something's wrong
right
imagine trump in charge
and he realizes that there's a supply
chain problem you don't think he can fix
that
because i think he could
because whatever is causing this is
fear bureaucracy or red tape
right it's like fear bureaucracy red
tape inertia
politics maybe
something like that
those are all trump's sweet spots
that's exactly what you want to trump
for
remember i don't say trump is the best
at all things presidential
i think he was not so good at her health
care you know although he did some good
things there too
but there are some things he's just sort
of perfect for the border is one
negotiating with china hard that's
another
north korea he was perfect for it
but
and this this truck shortage i think
he'd be perfect for this because he has
exactly the qualities you need but biden
has none of them
biden has none of them
so that's why we're here
i saw an interesting concept by twitter
user phil reed
he was making an analogy to my talent
stack idea where you add talents
together that makes sense to make
yourself more valuable
and he said there's a similar thing with
the apple ecosystem
meaning that if you start getting into
apple products
because they work together you know the
the fact that i could go from my phone
to my
ipad to my computer and i'm still in the
same place etc
um and a number of other things that
make the product work together he makes
the point that you don't have to be the
best at any of those things
if you've built it if you built an
ecosystem
where they all work together
and i thought that was somebody says
synergy yeah i mean
you could say it's just synergy
but
i think it gives a little more meat on
the idea
to compare it to the talon stack on idea
and say it's a an ecosystem stack if you
will everything from your watch to your
computer all have something in common
and they work together as i just thought
it was an interesting take on that
big news about facebook they're changing
their name
do you know why facebook is changing
their name
anybody anybody why are they changing
their name
well in my opinion
well first of all they may have some
baggage they want to get rid of and i
also think facebook doesn't sound like a
current name does it
having the word book
in a tech company name
it's really not a
forward-looking name is it
it was fine for a while
um but the biggest reason they're
changing the name is that their business
is going to change
in a big way and i would argue that this
change in facebook will be one of the
biggest changes in human evolution
one of the biggest changes in human
evolution
like real big like as big as opposing
thumbs
like that big
here's why
um apparently they're going to go uh
balls to the wall into the metaverse
or the virtual worlds which are created
by
3d you know graphic stuff and ar
artificial reality and virtual reality
so facebook is creating an entire new
reality
multiple realities
and each of these realities will have a
function
so one of the fake realities might be a
conference room
where you put on your goggles and you go
to that conference room and you're
you're in that room
others might be vacations
you might be able to take a group
vacation somewhere
just with your goggles on
you might be able to fly somewhere
just with your goggles on
and i would argue
you don't see how big this is
i don't think any of you can see how big
this is
the only people who can see it are the
people who have tried the technology
if you've tried it
you know how big this is
because right now it's it's sort of in
its infancy in a way maybe you know
maybe it's sophomore year or something
so it's not ready for prime time
i would say
but
oh that's dangerous it's not ready for
prime time
but it's going to get there really
quickly and fairly obviously
and
i this is huge let me tell you what i
know i did get a virtual reality
system a few years ago just to check it
out and just a few years is probably
completely different now but when when
you have the virtual reality
headset on
your
your experience is so rich
it can be better than real life
it's a problem
[Laughter]
the virtual reality
can be better than real life and maybe a
lot
imagine if you will that you're
unattractive
i know
hard for us to imagine because the
people who watch me are unusually sexy
but imagine you're somebody else
and you're not the sexy beast that i
know you are
how much are you going to like living in
the real world where people treat you
like elephant man
versus living in the virtual world where
you look like your avatar
and people interact with you as the
avatar
which one are you going to want to spend
more time in
yeah disabled people now well actually
let me take that back
i think you trap with that comment you
trapped me into
uh saying something uh ill-liberal is
that the right word
if we assume that disabled people and
let's say differently abled disabled by
itself is not as woke as it should be
we'll say differently abled people
if you make the assumption that they
need a virtual reality you kind of
that's kind of not cool you know what i
mean
because just that being differently able
doesn't mean you have to leave reality
or something so i guess i was a little
offended
by your suggestion even though i totally
understand it so your suggestion is
completely fair
but i don't know if did anybody else
feel that
if if you talk about uh
differently abled people and i agree
with that that wording by the way
uh you can certainly see that there
would be people in that category who
would like the virtual worlds better so
that the comment is perfectly fair
but i don't know just
just imagining that there's a group that
needs to get out of reality is
i guess i said the same thing with
unattractive people
if you are blind interesting if you're
blind you're not going to have any
access to this
that's a really interesting point
yeah i wonder if there's a way to get a
virtual site
i'll bet there is
i'll bet you could get virtual sight
someday
something you know directly
yeah neuralink kind of thing
directly linking to your brain
maybe
someday anyway i don't think you realize
how gigantic that is it's really
gigantic there's some fake news about
southwest airlines
fake in the sense that it's being
reported in an incomplete way so
hannity was tweeting this and what
hannity said was breaking
southwest airlines drops plan to place
unvaxed workers on unpaid leave
now if you hear that they stopped their
plan to put unvaxed workers on unpaid
leave
you would say to yourself hey
they're going to put people who are
unvaccinated on
unpaid leave or they were before is that
true
it's true-ish but it's missing too much
context
right it's true-ish
the context is missing is that the only
people involved were the people who had
applied for
exceptions
religious or otherwise
and had not gotten an answer yet
so to me all they're doing is delaying
the mandate until they can work through
the number of people asking for
exceptions so to me it looks like
nothing
to me it just looks like nothing like
nothing changed except they just delayed
it until they feel they can do it right
so i feel like this was fake news to
imagine that they reversed the policy
i think all they did was make a
practical decision that they couldn't do
everything as quickly as they wanted i
think that's all
we'll see we want more news might come
out of that
i would like to call out
one of my
internet friends for cognitive
dissonance
now this is somebody i
interact with a lot might even be
watching so if you're watching i'm going
to be talking about you in a moment
so this is nothing personal about the
person okay
so i'm going to say something that you
might think is personal
it's not because it's somebody i like
but this person i believe is is
experiencing cognitive dissonance
and when you experience cognitive
dissonance
you're the only one who doesn't know
that's the nature of it right so if i
experience it i will swear i'm not
you're the only people who know
nobody else is going to know all right
so i'm talking about justin hart all
right justin i see you're guessing so
stop guessing
his name is justin hart great guy
uh interacts a lot uh on twitter
have had lots of interactions with him
but he's more on the let's say i don't
want to characterize other people too
much but i say he's on the skeptical
side
of uh the pandemic conversation it's on
the skeptical side
and here's something he said today
talking about the southwest airlines
story so he said in a tweet uh quote
they caved they'll cave more when the
next deadline comes again
since now that part i'm not arguing with
that that whether they caved or whether
the cave again so no argument about that
but the next part
tell me if i'm experiencing cognitive
dissonance because you're the only ones
who know right i can't tell
i think
justin is experiencing it so here's the
next sentence you ju you be the judge
okay
he says since 40 40 to 60 of all
infections are coming from fully
vaccinated people
now first of all i don't know if that's
true
but let's let's accept as true that
there are a lot of vaccinated people
getting
uh getting infected so that part's true
right i don't know if it's 40 to 60.
that's
i'm not sure that's right but let's just
say there's a lot of them
right
somebody says it's absolutely true
and i'm seeing other people saying it's
not true
so i want everybody to know that some
people say it's true and some people say
it's not true i don't know i don't but
it doesn't matter to my point
we all agree that there are a lot of
vaccinated people getting infected right
we're all on that page
a lot of vaccinated people are getting
infected all right
so here's what he says because the 40 to
60 percent of all infections are coming
from fully vaccinated people
he concludes that the mandates seem
superfluous
do you think the fact that vaccinated
people also
get infections and quite frequently does
the fact that they're vaccinating make
the mandate seem superfluous now hold on
hold on
i didn't say is the mandate a good idea
in your opinion
that's not the question
so you're not judging whether mandates
are good or bad all right nobody's
judging mandates i know your opinion on
mandates i don't like them
most of you don't like them
so we're not talking about whether
mandates are good or bad that's not the
topic
the topic is
whether the fact that many vaccinated
people get infections
does that make a mandate
senseless
is that fact
important to the decision
i see yeses i see lots of yeses
that that's important to the decision
i see one now but mostly yeses
so most people are agreeing with justin
that a mandate is superfluous
now you know that superfluous means
completely unnecessary right
everybody got that
that the mandate
would be
have no effect basically
have no
effect
if uh so many vaccinated people are
getting infected how many people think
that's a good
conclusion
there's somebody here who still thinks i
like mandates
how could you be so misinformed i've
only said it every single time i've been
on live stream
i think every single time i set up i
oppose mandates
because enough people are
vaccinated all right here's what i had
problem i have with that
the
the reason that these airlines want
people to get vaccinated has nothing to
do with
how many of them got infected
it's just not part of the decision
so it seems like cognitive
dissonance to imagine it even matters
because here's the calculation
that if you are vaccinated you're
unlikely to die
and you're far less likely to spread it
now those two things are agreed by
science
right i can't i mean i haven't tested it
myself
but science is very clear
assuming they're right
very clear
that it takes your risk of death down to
trivial
and it uh your risk of spreading it
is much less
i see james say wrong
so there are people who will be on yeah
false i'm saying ochango says
so here's here's my challenge to you
i'm saying that my audience is split on
this
my understanding
is that it's really really clear like
super clear
way way clear like multiples clear
like the clearest thing you could ever
know
the vaccinations reduce your risk
and risk and the amount that you spread
some somebody's saying marginal i'm
saying that's completely wrong
that it's not marginal it's more like
seven to one eleven one two hundred to
one
i think i read is like 200 times more
likely you'll spread it if you're not
vaccinated
200 times
i don't know if that's right but say
it's 11 times
or 10 times whatever it is it's not
close right
so the rat race says lol shark
the shark
by telling you something you didn't know
because most of you are actually
confused by the fact that lots of people
get infected while vaccinated and
therefore the vaccinations don't have a
purpose
that is so wrong according to science
now if science is wrong well
i guess
we all got fooled
but you do know that they're
unanimous right
it is unanimous
let me say it again
i'm pretty sure that even the doctors
who are the rogue doctors
who are telling you it's a bad idea to
get vaccinated and you watch a lot of
them right how many of you have watched
doctors say hey i'm not so sure about
these vaccinations you know the rogue
doctors
a lot of them say that but as far as i
know
i think even the rogues agree
that you're far less likely to die
from covin as opposed to the vaccine
itself
and that your risk of spreading it is
way way less
um i think those are things that even
the critics agree with by the way
so here's my challenge to you i say that
even
the experts who are
anti-vaxx
would agree with the statement that the
vaccine
reduces your risk of covid and your risk
of spreading it vastly
even the critics so that's my challenge
to you
find out any critic
somebody says israel that's been
debunked
i know you've read news stories that say
the opposite but they've all been
debunked
go check it yourself
yeah you do the research you won't find
any experts who don't who disagree with
me
so since i know that
justin
who i was talking about here since i
know him to be someone who's following
this topic closely
and also you know smart guy
i feel as if his previous skepticism
is maybe triggering him
into cognitive dissonance
now
as i've argued before
you need a trigger there has to be
something that makes your worldview not
make sense
that triggers the cognitive dissonance
i would argue i don't have that trigger
because as far as i know i haven't
predicted anything that was wrong
or at least relative to this specific
topic obviously i've predicted things
that were wrong
oh somebody says i got vaccinated
well that's a good
would that be a trigger
would it be a trigger
to think that i was right
because here
so that was a good that's a good comment
did you catch that
somebody said that i'm vaccinated and
that could be my trigger
because i made a decision therefore i
have to be consistent with my decision
but here's my defense of that
my defense is that i don't know that i
made the right decision
hear that clearly
i took a
what i thought was a calculated risk
that had a risk of going wrong in either
direction
so i'm open to the fact that i made the
wrong decision or that new information
would
make it look like a bad or worse
decision that it was
i'm completely open to that there's
nothing that would change my
i know view of myself
if i turn down to be completely wrong on
the
vaccination stuff because to me that
would be interesting
i would admit it immediately
i wouldn't be embarrassed
because i just don't feel embarrassment
for stuff like that
and i've said from the beginning of the
pandemic a lot of people are going to be
really wrong
don't hold it against them we're all
doing the best we can you know we're
guessing we're doing the best we can
and so i put myself in the same category
that i put others in which is yeah we're
going to get some stuff wrong
and people might die
literally i could be killing people
literally
because if i've said something that
persuaded somebody to make a choice they
went to maine and it turned out to be
the wrong choice i could be killing
people right now and that's not even a
little bit hyperbolic
so i'll tell you what protects me a
little bit
from cognitive dissonance and again
how would i know
but
i'm open to being wrong and embrace it
and i don't have to protect against it
so i don't have an ego wall that says oh
if i'm wrong this is going to be bad for
me i don't
if i'm wrong i'm just i'm just wrong
i'll talk about something else
i'm pretty sure i can live with that
vax does not reduce the spread this is
what right lane bandit says in all caps
vax does not reduce the spread it
reduces death get educated
okay let me say this as clearly as
possible all the experts disagree with
you
there's nothing you could google that
would that would agree with you
nothing
nothing
there's no expert that has your opinion
even the people who agree with you that
you shouldn't get vaccinated don't have
that opinion
i'm seeing bud say bandit is right
all right so here's your challenge
find me a uh
some scientists who
who are not in some sketchy blog site
you know some some credible looking
thing
that suggests that all the experts are
wrong and and and see if he can change
my mind
all right change my mind
uh
doctor no dr bhattachary does not say
that nope
nope
all the ones you think say that are
saying something different i think that
might be the confusion because there are
people who are anti-vaxx
so i'm not i'm not saying there are no
anti-vaxx
people i'm saying that the reason
they're anti-facts is that they think
there's more risk from the vaccination
than the covet
and i'm not even arguing that point
because i wouldn't know one way or the
other
there are other reasons for anti-facts
right there are other reasons and that
they're not the ones i'm talking about
right now
yeah we're not talking about natural
immunity anything all right so
i feel that most of you are being
triggered into cognitive dissonance and
this is what's going to happen
here's how you can tell
those of you have been triggered into
cognitive dissonance
if in fact that's what's happening it
looks like it it looks like really clear
let me say as clearly as possible
i really know how to spot cognitive
dissonance
it's been my hobby for decades
i really really am good at spotting it i
think in other people
again nobody can spot it in themselves
but i would say that i'm as close as you
can get to an expert as spotting it in
the wild
and this is definitely it
if i'm wrong about this i'm wrong about
everything
this is cognitive dissonance now here's
how you can tell
most of you will misinterpret what i'm
saying
you're going to interpret it as being
pro-vaccination
nope
nope i did not say that
i never encourage you to get vaccinated
hear it clearly but many of you will
think that's exactly what you heard
some of you will think
that i said the vaccinations
stop all spread
nope nope never said that said the
opposite
so watch how the people who think
they're disagreeing with me are going to
be disagreeing with
an illusion of what i said
and they're going to be positive they're
right
because they're accurately disagreeing
with an illusion
but they're not disagreeing with me
and they're the ones in all caps
all the people in all caps are in
cognitive dissonance i guarantee that
i can promise you that the all caps
people
are having an experience that their
world is blowing up right now
all right
i think that's enough on that topic way
too much
so uh beyonce is in a commercial for uh
tiffany
and
apparently they turned her white
now i don't know what the real story is
but in the video her skin is lightened
to the point where
it would be hard to detect if she has
any african-american
yo influence
and
it looks like it's lightened to me
i mean i don't know if it's makeup or
the camera work but she's sitting next
to jay-z
who looks exactly like jay-z
like he doesn't look like he's been
lightened
well she sure did
and i think tiffany's going to have some
explaining to do on that
um
rasmussen asked how confident are you
that joe biden is physically and
mentally up to the job of president what
do you think people said
here's what they said
uh
41 percent are either very confident or
somewhat confident that joe biden is up
to it physically and mentally 41 that's
pretty high isn't it
yeah how many of them were very
confident
very confident not somewhat confident
but very confident
and so it's within the 41
the very confidence were 27
27
are very confident
very confident that joe biden's 100
yeah you're i'm laughing because the
regular viewers know i always point out
that every pole
seems to have 25 percent of morons
you'd have to be a to
think that joe biden is is right on the
ball
now i'm okay with the people who say you
know they're somewhat confident
some more confident i think that
you know that's enough of a hedge i'll
give you that you know that that just
sounds like somebody prefers
their person in in the office
uh but 58 were uh not confident
in joe biden or one way or the other
strongly or or weakly not confident and
two percent were unsure
two percent were unsure
can't we add them to the not so sure
there that he's
if you're unsure
shouldn't you have answered that you're
not confident
what does unsure mean
so apparently we found the two percent
who are the dumbest
the dumbest people in in the
world if you're unsure
you're unsure
apparently they don't know what
confidence means are you confident no
i'm unsure okay so you're not confident
no
i didn't say that i just said i'm unsure
oh well
rasmussen also asked is biden doing the
job of president or are others making
the decision for him
how do you think this went
53 percent say others are making the
decision
you realize that must include at least
a number of independents and or
democrats to get to 53
38 say he is doing the job
okay
so ron desantis
is opening up some ports in florida
to help ease the backlog in california
so it turns out that all these problems
that they have in california
i guess they don't have them in florida
so does that
give you any pause
do you think that truck drivers in
florida are more pro vaccination
do they do fewer
fewer hits of meth
in florida
can they can they get better uh truck
parts in florida
are there more trucks
i don't know none of this is quite
fitting is it now i'm not so sure that
whatever ron desantis is going to do in
florida will make that much difference
so it might be a slight
you know uptick so he might be making
more political hay out of it than is
really warranted but let me say about
this about that
ron desantis surfs
the headlines
and the zeitgeist
better than i've ever seen
apparently he has a political strategy
that i consider
brilliant
this is just one of the best things i've
ever seen and you don't really get a
sense of it until you see
how consistent he is over time
which is that there's some national
story of interest
and that he finds the populist way to
approach it
or the helpful way or the smart way or
the scientific way or the
you know the better strategy you know
protecting the old people first
whatever
so he's just the master of inserting
himself into the story that's already
there
he can insert himself into any story
and make himself look like the only
smart person in the room
over and over again
this is brilliant
political
now again i don't know if any of the
things he's doing make any difference at
all
i really don't i don't even have much of
an opinion on the specifics of his
policies
i'm just saying i've never seen anybody
do politics better than this
this is the best politics i've ever seen
this is better than trump
sorry
because trump causes trouble
to get attention and it's very
successful made him president right
but if trump didn't exist
desantis would walk into the nomination
he would just walk into the nomination
don't you think
like who would it be if it's not
desantis
it's just a great strategy
all right neil cavuto um you know him
from fox news has covet
now
can somebody give me a fact check
i know that neil cavuto has quite
publicly struggled with his weight for a
long time but in current pictures he
looks like he lost a bunch of weight
did he six yes and you're saying he he
also has uh
multiple sclerosis he's doubled with
that for years i guess
but it looked like he
he lost a bunch of weight can you
confirm that
he's
oh i've really come around on desantis
well he's still not exciting but damn
he's he's good at this stuff
um
yeah so i'm seeing at least one
confirmation there but good for him so
the first part is if
if he lost a bunch of weight during the
pandemic and he did it for all the right
reasons
good for him
he may have he may have saved his own
life now he was vaccinated too so he'll
probably be fine
but
i just like to call out anybody who did
the right thing during the pandemic
and the right thing was to get fit
if you didn't do that
you played the pandemic really wrong
if you didn't add any skills while you
had you know a weird opening to do it
you played it wrong
it looks like he might have played it
right if he lost weight
tentatively that's that's my guess
and
he's
the other thing that makes him kind of
important to the story is that he is a
walking comorbidity or people
you know may think of it that way
because he's had public health problems
somebody said he's a cancer recovery too
i think that's true
um
so if he does well because he's
vaccinated that's gonna be a story and i
think that would be
influential
all right
uh cnn has good context for a change
you're going to hate this
this is where i'm going to lose most of
you
first of all cnn has some good context
on the story i know you don't like that
but when do you hear it you're not going
to like this at all
um and you're also going to say that all
the numbers in the story are wrong all
right you ready
um how many people let me do a test with
you how many people are confirmed
now confirmed is the the operative word
here how many are confirmed
to have died in the united states from
the vaccination itself let's call it the
covenant shot not a vaccination
how many people in the united states
have died in the entire pandemic
so far from the
the shot go
zero is wrong
three
somebody says three
really
fifteen thousand i'm saying thousands
now i'm talking confirmed remember so
those of you are guessing thousands you
know those are not thousands that are
confirmed
so just confirmed
i'm saying 30 17 2000 less than 10 less
than 100
uh 18 000 25 000
666
52 maybe 10.
here's the number that
cnn reports
uh
three
three
does that match your your
assumption
do you believe that
three people
are confirmed doesn't mean only three
just confirmed
do you believe that
that's what cnn's reporting how about
that vares database
because you know there's all kinds of
stuff in there right that's where people
report the bad reactions to
uh vaccinations
how many
here's the second question
um
how many people have been how many
deaths are reported to vares remember
there are three that are confirmed
but how many have been reported to vares
go
the verse says how many people died from
the covet shot
go
how many i see thousands thousands
anybody youtube
forty-two
thousand fourteen thousand
three point five trillion good guess
we're wrong
three
uh the answer is 8 600.
so 8600 deaths have been reported to the
the vares database
three have been confirmed
three
now is the problem
that we're really really slow at
confirming things
or is a problem that
they're not real
i don't know suppose they're real
suppose every death reported to varys
was real how bad would that be
yeah if every death reported to varys
was real and that seems deeply unlikely
if they were all real would that tell
you that and that's all you knew would
that tell you to get the shot or not
here's your next question if 8 600
people died and if that were real and we
all know that's not real but if it were
real
would that tell you not to get the shot
somebody says yes
i see some no's i see some yeses yeses
all right well here's how you could have
seen that in
uh context
390 million doses have been administered
and that amounts to .0021
or about two deaths for every hundred
thousand doses
which is
way less
than how many people die of covet
remember the all caps people are always
in cognitive dissonance so if you if
you're going to type in all caps just
know i'm calling you out
all right
so this is cnn's reporting by the way
this is not me saying any of this so
according to
cnn if you looked at all the doses given
there are
only two deaths for every hundred
thousand but how many kova deaths are
there for every hundred thousand
so this is cnn two deaths
from every hundred thousand doses even
if the vares database is correct that's
how it would only be two for every
hundred thousand how many does covet
kill out of a hundred thousand
if the if it's true that the vaccination
is two how many does cove would kill
220
right
um that's a hundred times worse
two
versus over two hundred
so if these numbers were right even if
the vares database was accurate and you
know it isn't it's way way high
well it could be low i suppose but you
know it's not accurate
um
according to these numbers it would be a
hundred times smarter to get the
vaccination if this was the only
criteria and it's not right
i i get it there are other criteria
but if this were the only criteria the
vares database risk versus the coveted
risk itself it wouldn't even be close
it would be a hundred to one
cassandra says scott you're in deep
dissonance
and i wouldn't know
so if you believe that the problem is my
end
let me let me say as clearly as possible
i wouldn't know that's what cognitive
dissonance does but if the problem was
on your end
you wouldn't know
can we agree on that
if the problems are your end you don't
know if the problem is on my end i don't
know that's what it is that's the
definition of cognitive dissonance
all right so i'm not suggesting that you
should get vaccinated can i can i say
that
i am not suggesting that you get
vaccinated nor am i suggesting that you
don't
do you know why
why the hell would you take my advice to
get vaccinated
can you think of anything dumber than
that
well i mean seriously what would be
dumber than taking my advice on your
medical situation
right i mean i'll tell you to drink
coffee and exercise
you know i feel safe about that but
don't take my advice and don't let me
persuade you in any way and also don't
believe anything the cnn reports i'm
reading cnn's report
let me give you an example of how bad
this cnn data is you ready and i know if
if andres is watching this he's or he's
already screaming at his screen
i read this and you you probably missed
it
but he said it would be 390 million
doses administered
they're actually calculating the deaths
on doses
versus people
what
so they're acting as though
your risk
per dose is the one that you're you're
looking at not your risk of being
vaccinated
versus not being vaccinated
now
it's not crazy to do that because your
death probably does follow a specific
dose
but it's not going to follow the second
one is it
how many people died when they got the
second dose
zero
maybe
do you think that people
lived through the first dose
and then the and then the second or the
third one took them out
i don't think so
i don't think so so this this is off by
at least 100 percent
right so cnn's numbers are off by at
least a hundred percent
and this still makes the case
let me say it again
cnn numbers are probably off by a
hundred percent
and it still makes the case that is way
smarter to get
vaccinated the not not even close
even if their numbers are off by 100
even if the vares is off by
a thousand percent
it's still according to their numbers
way smarter to get vaccinated that's not
me saying i'm talking about what other
people are saying right
only in the short term somebody says yes
so if you were looking at your full risk
of
getting the shots versus not you would
have to look at the long term that's
still unknown
so as clearly as i can say it let me
summarize again that i'm not telling you
it's risk free or risky i don't know
don't listen to me i'm just telling you
that you might be looking at the wrong
stuff to make your decision
wouldn't you rather look at the right
stuff
i mean if you don't want to get the
vaccination you have plenty of argument
plenty of argument
you don't need the bad arguments so
don't use the vares database as your
argument because that's a bad argument
here's a good argument you want a good
argument for not getting vaccinated
again this is not me advising it
but i will advise you what a good
argument looks like
a good argument looks like i'm young and
healthy
and i don't trust the government or
anything they say about the vaccinations
so therefore none of the data pro or con
is useful to me because i don't trust
any of it
and nobody knows what will happen in the
long term
is that that's your best argument
if as soon as you depart from that into
statistics you're just wrong
you're just wrong because this the
statistics all come from official
sources
the official sources are all the same
direction
so if you're using any kind of credible
official numbers they all point in the
same direction and that's not your
argument
the argument you can make is subjective
don't use data data doesn't work in your
favor but there is a strong subjective
argument that the people who are
recommending it can't be trusted
is anything wrong with that argument the
people recommending that you put this in
your body
can't be trusted
that's it
you don't need more than that
they can't be trusted if you need a
hundred examples of why you shouldn't
trust them i can give them to you
but
that's all you need
is coming from a source i don't trust
period
hasn't been tested in the long term
why would i take your word for it
right
um
so there is so
there is a good argument for not getting
vaccinated but it's not based on any
statistics it's not based on numbers
there is no numbers-based argument for
not getting vaccinated
nor you could argue is there a
numbers-based argument for getting
vaccinated
because it's all unreliable numbers
but at least the unreliable numbers are
all in the same direction
you know the official ones
the experts are on the roof
yeah
all right
yeah and if you know if you want to make
uh exceptions for this or that that
makes sense
so
um
for those of you who are angry that my
opinion disagrees with yours it probably
doesn't
i'm anti-mandate
because of freedom and because you have
a choice of getting vaccinated
and while i do understand the the basic
concept of
you know
the mandate is so we'll all be protected
from each other
we're dangerous to each other all the
time
you get that right
we are all dangerous to each other all
the time
if we have sex we're dangerous to each
other if we get in the car we buy a gun
even though we don't plan to shoot
anybody it's a gun
so we live in a world in which we're all
being dangerous to people all the time
as long as that's our standard
no mandate
now you know if this were polio i'd
probably have a different opinion
but
given the the specific nature of this
pandemic
i don't see the argument for the i don't
see the argument for a mandate
now
some of you asked me scott are you going
to get a third
booster
and again you should not follow my model
right nobody should look at what i'm
doing to inform them how to do it that
would be the wrong way to approach a
medical decision
um
so anyway
take care of yourself don't listen to me
but don't use the numbers as your
argument if you're anti-vaccination it
just doesn't work all the numbers are
against you
all of them
all the numbers are against you
doesn't mean the numbers are right
right so i want you to hear that clearly
i'm not saying the numbers are right the
official numbers probably they're wrong
like every other official number but
they're all in the same direction so
just don't use that argument
um about the booster yes
uh my decision to get a booster is
undecided because oh yes and i'll be on
the uh viva
and barnes uh later
today
so look for bmv and burns later today um
circular argument what's the what's the
circular part
uh numbers are all made up they might be
oh uh so just finishing up on the
booster so um i'm going to make the the
same process i did to decide on getting
the vaccination since i got the
vaccination late
you know my immunity is a little higher
than people who got it earlier so i have
some time so i'm going to wait as long
as possible
to have the most information
if i don't hear any information that is
you know
startlingly negative
i'm inclined to get the booster
just because there's a consistency thing
about it right if there's no new
information why wouldn't i use the same
decision because there's no new
information but
am i comfortable with it
no
does that help you
am i comfortable getting a booster nope
was i comfortable getting the first
shots no
you shouldn't be either
what how can you be comfortable with it
like i said the people who are telling
us to do this are all liars they're all
undependable but you had to do something
right there's a risk of getting
vaccinated there's a risk of not you
just had to make a decision
and
you know
not getting vaccinated is a decision
we all made decisions without the right
amount of information
everybody agree with that
that all of us made the decision without
enough information
we kind of guessed
and then we imagined that we used data
after the fact but we didn't it was
based on
just how you felt basically
um all right i gotta go run and do some
other things and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
