about this
uh how about your president you say you
know what the only way to solve the uh
solve the network problem is more people
have to have a solar battery at their
house
now i think musk would agree because i
think there's a way
if enough homes had their own solar
backup power
that could feed the grid when the green
grid needs it
i believe there's a way to
protect the grid without completely
redoing it
we also need to completely redo it
but in the short run if you said hey
let's get everybody who can afford it
these solar batteries
if you're rich enough to get a solar
battery do the country a favor and get
one
how about that message
i'm not asking poor people to do
anything differently
we're just trying to keep the lights on
for you guys but if you can afford it
the the house battery will pay for
itself so i'm not asking you to lose
money
i'm asking you to do what makes sense
for yourself
in a free market but know that this
specific thing that you're doing for
yourself getting a house battery
whether it's tesla or some other product
there's a bunch of them now
that that thing will be good for you but
it's going to be really good for the
poor people
because we're keeping everybody's lights
on and keeping the prices down
yeah like a tesla power wall but they're
competitors to that now
