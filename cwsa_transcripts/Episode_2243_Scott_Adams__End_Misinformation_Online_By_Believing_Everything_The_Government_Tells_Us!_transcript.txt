good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I can
guarantee that you'll never have a
better time in your life
the next moments you know you need to
take that up to the level that people
can't even describe it's so amazing all
you need is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker jealous of style and a canteen
sugar flaska vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine did the day the
thing that makes everything better is
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
oh God that's good
oh that's so good
don't you feel better already I think
you do
well take that good feeling and we're
gonna
we're gonna double that
yeah double it
well let's see what's going on uh I love
reading rumors on the X platform
I never know what's true for the first
few hours you have to wait for the
debunking to come
but one of the stories I would put low
confidence on is that Justin Trudeau
Trudeau's plane had cocaine on it when
he visited India for the G20
is anybody hearing that story
that's not true is it
it sounds like not it doesn't sound like
a true story
I don't know I can't imagine that India
was all over his his plane
I don't know that doesn't sound real I'm
going to dismiss that as not real
all right here's another one that's
probably not real
um reportedly
at least in a tweet by unusual whales
BlackRock State Street and other
Mountain managers are closing their ESG
funds
according to Bloomberg
do you think that's really happening
are they closing their ESG funds or are
they just still doing ESG things and
trying to make it less obvious by not
using the name are they just changing
the name
makes you wonder doesn't it
but the good news is they've been
embarrassed
they've been embarrassed on a business
did I promise you that I would mock esgn
a business
I believe I promised you that I would
make it so embarrassing
that that nobody would want to associate
with it well I don't think I don't think
I did it alone
but I was part of a successful effort it
would seem
or it might be just
partially successful
but at the very least it's embarrassing
it's embarrassing to be associated with
it so that's something
do you know uh user cat turd
on the X platform very popular account I
think he's got over 2 million followers
uh I'm not one of his followers I
blocked him a long time ago
and I think Elon Musk blocked him too
so if you'd like to know the value of
cat turd
I can only tell you that two people that
I think are smart blocking
so I think he's a piece of honestly
and uh good because he he's one of the
many people who blamed me for having
opinions I don't I don't hold
so I have a very low opinion of cat turd
but apparently you got you got doxed by
the left
meaning they figured out where he lived
and what his real name was and he got
squatted
so somebody called the police and said
there's something dangerous happening
with a gun or something and they just
wanted
now I assume that's true
I'm not sure that it's confirmed but
it's reported
so boy the left is Pretty Tough aren't
they I was trying to think has the right
ever swatted the left
because I know Tim Poole always got
swatted all the time
if you don't it was what it is it's when
the Police SWAT team you know streams in
because they think there's a dangerous
situation happening at the moment but no
such thing is happening meaning somebody
called it in
yeah
yeah it looks like it's something that
only the left does to the right
as they try to go after each effective
speaker one at a time
so that's happening
um
so there's a uh probably a rupar kind of
a video of trump
in which he appears to
now before I go into the story I'm going
to close my eyes because I know what
your comments are and I don't want to
read them
yes I'm going to get to the point
where it appears that he's
misinterpreted so I don't want to open
my eyes and see all of your comments
screaming in capital letters sky
you misinterpreted that story
I promise you I'm gonna tell you both
sides of the story all right now I'm
going to open my eyes and I hope that
there are no comments screaming to me
that I haven't told the other side of
the story yet because I haven't started
yet can we can we get can we be on the
same page here
all right so there's a video of trump in
which the people tweeting the video or
alleging that he confused Jeb Bush with
George Bush
and you listen to the video and you say
to yourself yeah that's exactly what he
did I heard it with my own ears saw it
with my own eyes
and it must be a sign of dementia to not
know the difference between a Georgia
and a Jeb
and then other people said but Scott
listen to it more carefully
you're just misinterpreting it he's
talking about two different people
and two different contexts
and it all makes sense
So I listened to it again and it was
like one of those audio illusions
where once somebody tells you how to
listen to it you listen to it again you
go oh
oh that actually made complete sense
there was no dementia there at all
and then I wait a minute and then I just
play it again just like I'd seen it the
first time and there's plenty of
dementia there
and that I I remember what he was saying
and that I played again no Dimension at
all no makes perfect sense
same video
you you can you can watch it three times
in a row and that's yeah the green
needle is the the audio illusion one so
it does it does look
it's like it's a root bar
so it's a just Rupert
but it was very confusing people were
mad at me because when I tweeted it I
tweeted it with a comment age batters
now when I said age matters I was
intentionally being vague
because I knew that that was true no
matter what the video was
if he were not a certain age nobody
would have played that as a sign of
dementia
but the problem is when people are a
certain age
you start imagining you're seeing it
I'm sure that I've imagined seeing it
with Biden when maybe in some cases it
was some innocent non-problem
I'm sure I've overseen it with Biden but
with Biden I'm pretty sure it's there
so anybody a certain age you can imagine
you're seeing the signs of age even if a
younger person might have done exactly
the same thing
so age does matter it matters how we
perceive them and we wouldn't even be
worrying about it if we didn't all know
it's a risk that is people of a certain
age can can lose it and they can lose it
kind of quickly so you have to keep an
eye on them but I would say my my take
on this is that Trump was not only not
confused
but he was talking very quickly
on a fairly you know complicated little
story about this one that one you know
the last name of the Bush Etc and if you
listen to it carefully you got
everything right
but you have to really concentrate
otherwise you think he's the one who got
it wrong it's actually it's hard to
listen to because it's just complicated
we he says it fast it's not complicated
but he goes through the story pretty
quickly
so it's actually a sign of a good mental
health that he got all that right and
got it quickly and set it capably is
just it's easy to get it wrong
um
what
all right what else is going on um
have you noticed uh this was just
pointed out to me this morning
and I noticed it too but let's see if
any of you are on Tick Tock but if
you're watching the x-platform and
you've seen the the tick tocks that make
it over you know the most viral stuff
will sometimes end up on other platforms
if you noticed an anti-baby having
focus on tick tock
does anybody notice that there's a trend
of the women who are not having babies
uh bragging about how good their lives
are without babies and without being
married I guess
have you noticed that now given that
Elon Musk recently said that
depopulation might be the biggest
problem in the world
and I think he's right I think on you
know depopulation or lack of birth rates
you know birth rates are too low might
be the biggest problem in the world
because it's the one thing that could
crash every economy at the same time
um or at least the big ones at the same
time
and that would be pretty catastrophic
so at the same time that we're worried
about our birth rate
the platform that's created in China
seems to be encouraging American women
not to have babies but you say to
yourself but Scott they're not just
encouraging you know American women not
to have babies obviously everyone who's
on Tick Tock is going to see it it's not
just Americans
but China doesn't see it they don't
allow Tick Tock in their own country
because it's too dangerous
but we're idiots so we allow it in our
country well we're idiots but also our
Congress is corrupt there's no other
explanation for it and
I think this is a really smart play by
China
if you were if you were going to predict
who wins
I might predict China
because they've got this weapon that um
because our Congress is corrupt
obviously uh they can't stop
so as long as they pay our Congress to
let Tick Tock program the minds of our
children and our women
mostly the women
we should end up with a population
collapse and America should be gone in
one generation
as long as Tick Tock still is still
there
now some of you are going to say Scott
that's a little bit of hyperbole isn't
it that just Tick-Tock alone just Tick
Tock nothing else is that what you're
saying Scott that just this one app
will destroy the United States in one
generation is that what you're saying
really
really
yes
yeah as clearly as I can state it if we
allow Tick Tock to do what it's doing
now nothing different just what it's
doing now and just wait one generation
is unlikely America would survive
at least survive as a superpower
yeah it's that it's it's that
destructive because if they take out our
birth rate and it looks like they're
succeeding at that and why wouldn't they
because young women are influenced by
tick tock and it's telling them not to
have kids and if you look at the
relationship advice also on Instagram
which is not directly influenced by Tick
Tock but even Instagram
is full of relationship advice
that is so bad
I have to assume that they really don't
want anybody to get together and
successfully have children
the relationship advice from like the
the Talking Heads you've seen them
probably seen a million of them there's
always somebody they have the same voice
Authority voice and let me tell you that
one thing you're definitely going to
have to do is find a woman who has uh
three years if you don't find a woman
who has three ears well you're just
setting yourself up for a failure and
don't be surprised if you get a
two-yeared woman it doesn't work out for
you and every time I listen to them
they all have the same quality to them
there are people who have consistently
failed in their own relationships
but are claiming that at the moment the
relationship is working
sure I would love to see a statistic of
all the people who give relationship
advice including marriage therapists and
I would like to look at that as a
control group and see how their
marriages compare to the people that
they're training to have good marriages
do you think that the experts on
relationships have better relationships
doesn't look like it to me because you
don't demand all the male relationship
experts are saying
well if that woman you're with will not
Buckle to your will cutter loose
just cut it Loose you don't have to you
don't have to deal with it if the woman
in your life is not meeting your deeds
in every way if she's not if she's not
right on point if she doesn't let you do
what you need to do as a man and you'll
let you be you while being supportive if
she's not doing all those things just
let her go immediately Let Her Go
possibly the dumbest advice I've ever
heard in my life that's like advice for
somebody who'd never met a woman
it's like you've never met a woman
that you think you can find the one that
meets your needs and doesn't complain
what
have you ever met a woman
are built to complain
that's that's their basic operating
system if you got one that doesn't
complain
you might have a trans wife
but there's something special going on
there it's not like general advice you
could give to other people
I mean the best advice you could give to
anybody if they want to stay married is
marriage is really going to suck
but it's better than the alternative so
you know get over it
well that might work and then when
marriage really sucked I'd be like oh
they told me it would really suck
but it's probably better than the
alternative so I think I'll stick it out
that's it
that that's all the marriage advice you
need marriage is totally going to suck
it's just better than the Alternatives
and sometimes by a lot sometimes it's
not even close
but that's the truth
uh I love the people who tell you that
the key to getting married is to pick
the right person
does that advice ever work in the
history of advice have you ever have you
ever seen that work for anybody
if you pick the right person you're
probably not going to have chemistry or
chemistry that lasts
so this whole pick the right pick the
right person is like it imagines that
you have that skill nobody has that
skill
nobody has a skill to pick the right
person you don't even know who you're
getting until you're living together and
you're married
because people don't even act the same
the day after the marriage you know the
whole dynamic changes immediately so no
there's no such thing as good
relationship advice I've never seen it
it's all people giving you advice for
what might work in their case
under a special circumstance but it's
never generalizable
at all
all right
apparently uh chat GPT is getting an
upgrade I don't know if it's available
to everybody yet but it's going to be
able to talk and see
and here well I could hear before I
guess but it's going to be able to
basically have a conversation with you
and
look at stuff with you
now that is creepy
I don't know exactly what it means to
say that it will be able to see
I assume that if you have the app and
you're talking to it and you say hey I'm
trying to decide what groceries to buy
here you just like show at the groceries
say what do you think is the best one
you know what which one of these should
I buy or something like that or or just
point it at the object on the shelf and
say is there a cheaper price for this
so what is that what is that how it will
work are you literally just gonna have a
conversation with it like it's a person
in your hand and you can show it stuff
I don't know
that would be pretty sticky
if that's what this actually is I'm
already worried about it
because it might replace friends
like I can spend a lot of time talking
to an AI
because it would always it would always
know something I don't know
and it would be able to you know produce
it immediately it's like ah tell me
something I don't know about your if it
could read the news I'd really like it
if it could talk about the news with me
at the same time as the news is new
instead of you know historical oh my God
oh my God
so will we get to the point where people
will be experiencing the news by having
a conversation with chat GPT
and if so does that not give chat gbt
all of the persuasion power in the world
because they can decide what topics it
surfaces and what it doesn't
oh man your free will Is So Gone
Free Will is just God
it never existed in the first place but
you're you're illusion of free will will
be I guess that's what's gone
all right so that's fun we'll see what
comes of that
well there's more about the alleged
Biden corruption crimes and everything
is too complicated but let me see if I
can so this came from a tweet from
Kenneth Cole the Great
um who's really good you should follow
Canada with the Great
real good long threads on what's going
on politically
um so remember that Dr gal left
who was a whistleblower against the
bidens
specifically with their China
connections and then he then they're
trying to arrest him and he went into
hiding
so we don't know if we can trust this Dr
gal Luft
or or is everything he says a lie and
he's just on the other side from Biden
somehow
so we don't know what's true but he's
making lots of allegations about let's
see according to this tweet thread from
Kenneth Cole the great that Dr Gail left
alleges that the bidens used an FBI mole
so this this would be somebody who works
for the FBI
who is going to do something for the
bidens that should not have been done
allegedly to share sealed
sd-ny indictments with their G cefc
China Energy Partners all right so there
were some indictments going to be
handled down in New York and had some
importance to this Chinese Energy
company that Hunter Biden was associated
with and then the same day as as
the sealed indictments were handed down
Hunter Biden demanded Millions
from that company to do something and I
guess it was to allegedly to get them
the information of what was in the
sealed and diamonds and allegedly it
looks like
uh Hunter pressed them to give him
millions of dollars in return for the
FBI mole giving them some information
they couldn't get some other way now
this is all very elegationy
so I think you're this is all fog of War
I wouldn't believe anything about this
so wait to hear his defense
right Hunter is innocent until proven
guilty so it's a terrible allegation
but to be consistent with our concept of
innocent until proven guilty I think
you'd have to hear the other side of it
however there is an interesting fact
that Dr gal left is being saw for pharah
violations that means lobbying for a
foreign interest without registering as
a lobbyist when it appears that Hunter
was doing the same thing
but not indicted
and maybe both of the bidens were doing
the same thing but at least Hunter
so we have many questions here which
look very damning for the current
Administration meaning it looks like the
current administration were and are
criminals and that they were and are
covering up for their criminal Behavior
by pressure on various organs of the
government
so it looks like it's exactly what it
looks like
so far all evidence suggests that the
government is corrupt and is covering it
up successfully
successfully covering up
well so let's talk about the shutdown
so the shutdown the government shutdown
is about whether they'll approve the
budget which some say needs to be
changed or they won't to approve it and
so there's a and then pass and there
won't be a budget and that will cause a
number of government things to stop
happening but not all of them
so the game now is for each side to see
if they can make it look like the other
side's bigger problem
so there so the game now is to blame the
other side as effectively as possible so
that you can politically win so none of
this is for your benefit right so if you
think any of this has to do with the
public oh no we're not even part of this
conversation this is all about the
political people you know shaming and
damning the other side for political
points
um however I am on the side of Matt
Gates who says shut it down unless
you're going to let people vote on the
bills individually which is the only way
you would ever get to a balanced budget
so Matt Gates is playing the long game
he's playing the systems are better than
goals the system doesn't work at all he
wants to fix it by getting McCarthy to
agree what McCarthy already agreed
before but apparently went back on his
his commitment to have the Bill's
individual
now it's no surprise why people do it
it's because they need to hide something
unpopular
in a larger bill with things you can't
say no to
so we'll see who wins on that but uh
here's what Biden said about it in
public quote the black community in
particular is going to suffer if that
occurs for example a shutdown is going
to risk nutrition assistance for nearly
7 million moms and children it's going
to disproportionately affect black
families
now what did I tell you every time
somebody says let's compare the average
of this group to the average of the
other group you should ignore them
because that's just political
there are no average people there are
only poor children who will not have
nutrition
some of them are one color some of them
are the other color some are mixtures of
this or that but there's just people
now if he said poor people will get
screwed I would say well that sounds bad
don't want to screw any poor people so
maybe we should take that into
consideration
but if you say it's going to
disproportionately affect the black
community that is pure manipulative
every person who is affected is a person
every individual in the story is
infinitely different from every other
individual there are no average black
kids there are no average white kids
nobody's an average person it's just
individuals with individual problems so
whenever you hear people talk about
group versus group average they are
manipulating you with propaganda and
they're not part of the solution for
anything
well when they were when there was a
whistleblower or two saying there were
UFOs and they've been captured and we've
even got some dead bodies released some
biologics as they like to say we got
some biologics
uh you may have said to yourself well
that's probably a bunch of BS
but now we have as Michael
schellenberger points out dozens
we have dozens of UFO whistleblowers who
have similar stories dozens I say
I haven't seen any dozens of
whistleblowers except for Michael
schellenberger saying so
are there dozens of whistleblowers and
somehow I'm missing that news
was that on the regular news that there
were dozens of whistleblowers
how come I'm not aware of it
all right well let me ask you this if
it's true that there are um if
shelenberger says so I'm sure it is true
um if there are dozens of Uso UFO
whistleblowers
what is your opinion of whether they're
right there are dozens of them similar
stories dozens I say does that make it
more likely
don't you feel
that there's a specific question that
you want to ask about this
there's one specific question I want to
ask it goes like this
of the dozens of whistleblowers
how many of them actually have touched a
UFO
like with her hand
touched it
or how many of us stood over a table
they had the biologics right in front of
them
or is it possible that dozens of people
heard it from one person
is it I'd like to remind you of a story
I tell this story a lot but the story
says so much about human beings that
I'll I'll tell it again when I was
working in my corporate job at the phone
company one of my big projects was to
build a technology laboratory to build
it out in one part of the headquarters
and I was in charge of the construction
and approval and budgeting and
everything to get it done I was I was
very young and my boss said here's the
deal or all our customers keep asking us
for a place they could come test their
equipment to see if it's compatible with
these Services we're offering because
there were lots of different equipment
offerings
and so so many people have asked for it
that we really need to build this
laboratory because our customers are
just like all over us about it it's like
every day we're getting asked can you
please test in a laboratory
so I took the job you know accepted the
project not like I had a choice and I
went off to put together the business
case
so I could get funding now it would be
easy to do the business case because all
I had to do was talk to these customers
they would say oh yeah we can't even
purchase this until we've tested it and
then I'd say well that's a that's a
really good argument we've got all these
customers who say they can't make a
purchase decision until they see it work
so we need to give them a place they can
see it work obvious right easy case
simplest thing you could ever get
approved because it's going to affect
you know Untold number of big deals
for you know one little Laboratory
pretty pretty good investment so I asked
around I said hey who's who are these
customers can you give me some names so
I could talk to them and somebody gave
me a name of a customer
but before I talk to that customer I
talked to some other people in the
company to see if I can get some more
names
and they said oh yeah there's a lot of
people want this and they said uh here's
an example and they gave me this name of
the same customer so that didn't help me
much because I had just one customer
you know that I got twice so I talked to
some more people and said so how do you
know
how do you know that we need this they
said all the customers customers keep
asking they say what customers can you
give me a name they said well I don't
know the names of the customers but if
you talk to you know this manager or
this manager they'll tell you that a lot
of customers are asking for it and then
they ask me so I know there are lots of
them because I heard it not from one
manager but I've heard it now from
several places within the company
they're they're all saying that their
customers are asking for it so I'm not
directly talking to the customers but so
many of my staff are talking to them
that I know it's a really big deal
do you know at the end of it what I
found out
there was only ever One customer
who had asked for it once
and then the person that asked asked
around to try to help asked other people
and then the other people also wanting
to help
said I don't know maybe we should ask
around about this and so everybody was
asking around to try to help this one
customer
it was only ever One customer
I was building a 10 million dollar lab
to satisfy One customer and wait wait
for the punchline here's the punch line
the One customer
found a way to test it anyway and
already made their decision
there were actually zero customers who
wanted this service because the only one
who'd ever asked about it had figured
out a workaround
right so take that story
of how we could all believe there was
this giant need for a laboratory when
there were literally zero people asking
for it literally zero
now you might ask yourself Scott once
you found out that zero people wanted it
that's when you canceled the project
right
no no
you're silly you're silly no you don't
cancel the project just because there's
no reason for it because it already
started
once you start a project you're not
going to cancel it because you know
you're already trying to give funding
and everything
so the project went forward
but it eventually got canceled do you
know why
well why did the project get canceled
because there was a reorganization in
the in the business
and the new manager
said ah we don't need that
and that was it
because the new manager would not give
any credit for uh going forward with the
old manager's idea
because it was somebody else's idea
so the new ones was wasn't my idea and
there's no evidence for it so cancel it
I'll get my 10 million dollars for
something else
now
take that corporate experience which you
say to yourself well that was very
unique that was a weird little one-off
now that's not the point here the point
is that was a a
that's a one story that's very specific
but it gives you an idea how wrong
people can be in a massive way very
easily with no effort whatsoever they
can be massively wrong and if you tell
me there are dozens of whistleblowers
the only thing I want to know is how
many of those dozens put their hand on a
UFO
touched it
do you think Eddie
I'm going to guess zero
without knowing I've done no research no
research my guess is zero
but about every one of them heard it
from somebody credible
only bubbles are he touched it yeah so
Bob Lazar
um there are many people who are
questioning his
credibility
yeah so I got lots of questions about
the whistleblowers but I don't think
they've put their hand on any UFOs
um here's the next thing I expected to
happen I I wondered why this took so
long
Brett Weinstein is a subject of a hit
piece in the New York Times
and when I read it I would say oh yeah
that's just a hit piece I mean it's
obvious they weren't trying to get any
kind of a
both sides it wasn't because the story
was interesting because it wasn't
it was just taking out a player they
were they were literally just taking out
a strong player meaning somebody who
speaks well and is educated and you know
interested in a lot of topics and says
things that you don't hear from the
mainstream news sometimes right
perhaps sometimes wrong like all of us
but why would they target him
it's because what team he's on or what
team he appears to be on I I don't want
to because I don't think he would say
he's on a team I don't believe that
would be his own his own uh description
of his himself and I'm not sure that I
would say he's on a team he looks like
somebody who's just trying to follow the
data unfortunately the data do not
always follow what the left wants you to
believe
so anybody who's got credentials
and is willing to follow the data even
if it's wrong right even if it ends up
in the wrong place but anybody who's
just willing to look at the data first
is dangerous
and so he gets targeted it's exactly
what you think it is
now do you see the pattern yet
the pattern is pretty clear isn't it
it's very clear that everybody who has
maybe a little bit credible
is being targeted one at a time
it's very obvious at this point anybody
who doesn't see it you you're trying not
to see it at this point
all right so uh
if uh if there's some way to support
Brett knowing he's targeted
by his books and
go look at his podcasts but but I think
uh you know it has to be not a political
here pieces can't they shouldn't
actually put you out of business
but that's the world we live in
all right I guess Newsom is going to
debate DeSantis on November 30th
and um I've said before that
I don't think it helps them
because a governor debate is going to
look like a governor debate
it's just not going to feel like a
president debate it's going to feel like
the president has been decided you know
it's going to be Trump or Biden and it's
like the the undercard or something
nobody's going to take it seriously but
it will be good theater and I will
definitely watch it
um
but it could be the most corporate
boring two people who have ever been on
the stage at the same time
they're almost the same person aren't
they
'd be different policies obviously but I
feel like they're the same person
like one is just you know the other
version of that one person
you know their hair is a little too good
I don't trust people with hair that good
which one of the reasons I trust Trump
I trust people with sketchy hair
I I like it if their hair is like doing
something a little extra
all right but uh one of the things that
uh
Newsome is trying to claim is I guess he
keeps trying to deny answer the question
of whether he would support abortion up
to the point of birth you know the nine
month point
and
he says that's a political Canard
that that's a Canard
but Governor Newsom um do you think it's
okay to have an abortion at nine months
uh get away get away from me with your
canards
uh this is the no Canard Zone you know
you have to get through a a whole zone
of malarkey before you'd even get here
but this is the no Canard zone no
canards please keep your canards away
how many of you even know what a Canard
is
when I heard that I thought oh man he's
lost
he's lost if you have to use the word
Canard
let me ask you something think of the
best Communicator in all the politics
Trump
As Trump is the most persuasive
Communicator in all of politics maybe
ever
do you think Trump would ever use the
word Canard
talking to the public
Canard is not a public word no Canard is
what you say at your little cocktail
party with your your friends who are
also also writers
uh yes I was reading his eponymous book
oh it was just full of canards
and uh the Zeitgeist was so right for
the okra treatment of the Canard
I mean that is so douchebaggy Canard
all right I guess he figures if people
don't know what it means that he made a
point well I'd like you to talk about
abortion well uh that sounds like a
Canard I might use that I think if
anybody
challenges me on something where I'm
wrong like on that that Trump video that
I was talking about earlier where my
first take was that he says something
that didn't make sense but then later I
realized I was wrong instead of
admitting I'm wrong going forward I'm
just going to call it a Canard uh but
Scott I think you just took that out of
context
did I
or are you trying to start a Canard of
some kind
what
yeah uh you've got questions for me I
have questions for you
well but I'm just trying to ask a
question no no you're starting to you
tried to start a Canard some kind of
Canard here
yeah I'm going to use that
all right um
as you know free speech is pretty much
done as a practical matter in the United
States and I would like to trigger any
NPCs who have wandered in on the YouTube
YouTube side
can we get the uh now this is just an
experiment I'd like to see if I have any
NPCs so I'm going to trigger them
triggering coming
free speech is over in the United States
because of all the people getting
canceled for their speech
go NPCs say
come on NPCs say
you know what you say
you use mockery
mockery
and it goes like this may I Model A good
NPC
oh
oh so you're talking to a million
followers on the X platform and doing a
live stream every day
but your speech is being suppressed
by Ukrainian flag and feel bad
so that's what I get like my my comments
were just full of the NPCs explaining to
me the free speech is what the
government does it's not what a platform
does
now
I don't have to tell my smart viewers
here that uh
yeah I don't have to tell you that Free
Speech isn't what it was
during the 1700s
it's different now now you get canceled
and politically taken out and the NPCs
will will say that's different
that's that's not the government that's
just you said some messed up things and
it's a free market and so the free
market punished you for saying some
messed up things
do you realize that the left doesn't
know
that the entities that are punishing you
are just Democrats
in the the Democratic party the politics
part of it
forces the economic part of it to punish
you that is the government punishing you
the government is Democrats the
Democrats are the ones who run these you
know so-called
Watchdog groups like The ADL and the
fact Checkers and all that they're the
ones who are just a quasi-government
entities so the government just found a
workaround where they can suppress Free
Speech but they do it through the free
market
using these cutouts that pretend to be
watched oils and fact Checkers but they
they could create enough pressure on a
company that the company can remove
advertising and just you know take the
legs out of any Creator or speaker
now when I when I have this conversation
I'm talking to people who can't get
Beyond
the government didn't say so
yeah I know the government did not
directly say so they did it indirectly
by having these cutouts that take your
economic viability away and thus your
reach is depressed until nobody can hear
you so yeah you have the freedom to say
things in your house
but they'll take away all of your your
vehicles you see that the law is coming
out to rumble now
the ADL came after the Twitter platform
now X so you can see that the Democrat
operatives are trying to squeeze
um every form of economic benefit to
people who disagree
now try to have that argument with
anybody in 2023
because they say some form of blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah it's only about
the government doing it directly blah
blah I go I know
but they found a way to do it indirectly
so in effect they've suppressed the free
speech in all practical purposes
the government didn't do it directly
that's our free speech that framework no
you're not listening
I understand your argument completely
I'm saying in a practical sense in the
current world
they can effectively effectively get rid
of your Free Speech but it's not really
so it never works
but I'll tell you what does work
when somebody says you don't understand
Free Speech it's not about companies
cancel you I just say this now
your argument was very strong in the 80s
and I walk away
so that's that's a
a high ground maneuver The High Ground
accepts the argument completely
and then puts it in its proper place in
the 80s prior to the microphone prior to
the social media
if you if you even engage in the details
about why this is not or is technically
free speech in 2023 you're in the wrong
argument
it's the wrong argument
the argument is if you want to talk
about how things were in 1980s you can
but I'm not actually interested in the
1980s hypothetical argument I'm talking
about the real world today and real
things happen in the real world but
you're you're argument about what what
would be true in the 80s is noted it
just is relevant to today
that'll shut down people pretty fast try
that try it at home
all right I've got a question about
threads you know threads was the alleged
Twitter or ex-killer that Mark
Zuckerberg and meta did and it was
announced to Great Fanfare and it was
going to be the thing that was as good
as Twitter in in terms of features but
it wouldn't have all those Nazis
so it's like Twitter without all the
Nazis so obviously that's going to be a
success
because who wants Nazis so should have
been a big deal right right right
now here's my question
has Zuckerberg been known to make
gigantic stupid decisions in the past
would you say that's a characteristic of
his history the Zuckerberg made gigantic
stupid decisions in the past
now
having watched all the other Twitter
competitors fail you know the parlors
and the Getters and and Truth isn't
doing that much
do you think that Zuckerberg says you
know there's a good Market if I get into
that market I will make a lot of money
do you think he thought that
or
I'm just going to put this out here or
is it more likely
that he needs the government to be
friendly with him the government being
mostly Democrats at the moment
and that he cannot be on the other side
of Democrats and so Democrats said to
him here's the deal
we're going to try to destroy the
ex-platform through all of our other
mechanisms
but we need something that the people
could go to so we need you to create
this platform that has almost no
economic viability
unless we destroy the other platform
so start up the the alternative platform
for purely political reasons not because
it's a good investment and we'll try as
hard as we can to kill the other one and
if we're successful you've got a good
business
but basically you're not going to do
this because it it natively looks like a
good business you're only going to do it
as part of a government op to take out a
mosque
now which of those sounds more likely
without without the ability to know
what's true because you don't know
what's in his head does it seem likely
the Zuckerberg thought threads was a
good Economic Opportunity
does that sound like him
it really doesn't
no because his instincts have been
almost unnaturally good
up to this point
almost unnaturally
so
it sounds to me like he got pressured by
the government to try to take musk out
of business
that's what it looks like to me it
doesn't look like that was his decision
did you also notice somebody said that
Zuckerberg himself didn't even use
threads
you know after the first I don't know
weeks or a few weeks or whatever that
there were long periods where he didn't
even post
so he wasn't even interested in the
product himself
all indications are that Facebook did it
because they had to
am I wrong
doesn't your Suspicious Mind say this
doesn't even look like an investment it
looks like it was an OP
to take out musk and to take out the
last Bastion of free speech that wasn't
Rumble and Rumble doesn't have a big
enough audience that they would care
except that Russell Brand was there so
now they're going to take that out
no that would get me as well right if if
the ex-platform and Rumble went down I'd
be completely out of business
do you think they don't know that I mean
they know what other people think again
at the same time
all right so that's what I think I I
suspect that it was not created as just
a business opportunity
uh there is an anti-affirmation no
anti-affirmative action activist
uh the the one who is apparently
successful in uh getting College
admissions to be less racist and
he's using a uh it's a lawyer named uh
what's his name Edward Blum and he's
using a Civil War era law designed to
protect formally enslaved black people
from racial bias to dismantle American
corporate diversity programs
so in other words
so here's what the law said in 1866.
it was enacted after the Civil War and
it guarantees all people the same right
to make and enforce contracts quote as
is enjoyed by White Citizens so in 1866
the law was passed to make sure that
everybody could
have the same rights
and now that's being used to make sure
that everybody has the same rights
apparently successfully
because uh
there there are a number of lawsuits now
that are going after Fellowship programs
and whatnot that are
oriented specifically toward non-white
people
so there's at least one lawyer who's
found a way to make a difference in the
massive discrimination against white
people and is succeeding so good news
for that
um
so uh
we're seeing a lot of places rolling
back their misinformation policies
so the the news is acting like
some of our big entities thought that
they went too far with censorship and
now there's a pushback so they're
they're starting to loosen up and the
example is given
are that um
Facebook not Facebook YouTube I think
will no longer remove claims about the
2020 election
so you can wildly claim it was uh fake
or not and they won't demonetize you
um and then there's somebody else
who I guess some of the networks are
going to loosen up on claims about kovid
that are different than the official
claims
now think of those two categories
the pandemic that's over
and the election that's long over
those are the two things that we're told
are them being more reasonable about
free speech
those things don't matter anymore
their history it doesn't matter what
happened in the past it's not
controlling you today all this is
telling me is that the very next time
there's something important they're
going to do it again
because it's not it's not like it's some
kind of a larger emphasis to have more
free speech they're simply saying we we
accomplished what we wanted with these
topics
we got what we wanted because you
couldn't have Free Speech but now we got
what we wanted so yeah talk about talk
about it all you want there's nothing
happening like a move toward greater
Free Speech nothing every time you hear
somebody use the word misinformation as
part of their own business plan
even if they say they're going to allow
more of it
it is misinformation
whenever misinformation is part of the
conversation somebody's doing it
at that moment
all right
um
so if you were to read the the post on
the X platform today
you would see a lot of posts about long
covet
you would see some people saying it's
worse than we think studies show
and other studies would show and people
talking about there's no long covert at
all it actually never existed
and then he had other people say oh
there's a problem but it's the
vaccinations it's not the long covet
which of those things is true
go
you tell me
is it true that long covet is real
is it true that it was never real
or is it true that something's happening
but it's because of the the vaccinations
themselves what do you say
the answer is no way to know no way to
know yeah everybody who's confident they
know can be discounted if you meet
anybody who's pretty sure they know
what's going on with this long covet
situation or how much of it is
vaccination injury versus loan covet
don't listen to anything they have to
say there is no useful data about the
pandemic
and we're just gonna have to get used to
that
we're going to have to get used to the
fact that we don't know anything about
what happened and we never will
because nothing is is credible
there are only studies and reports and
data but none of it's credible zero of
it not a single thing that comes out of
that world is credible nothing and if
you don't get that everything's going to
be weird and confusing
all right
Rasmus and asked people about uh
willingness to support a mask policy you
want to be uh terrified 52 of Americans
would support a policy of requiring
people to wear masks in public
again
a majority
a majority
now even if that's not exactly right
it's way too many people
uh and how many would strongly support a
mask mandate 29 percent
now you know that that's almost all
Democrats right probably 75 percent of
the people who answered that way were
Democrats why is it that health
is
is divided by party line
don't you think something as simple as
should you wear a mask
you know under this situation don't you
think that that should be totally
scientifically based and it's not
because there is no science science is
basically just guessing
and the people have to look at the
science and go I don't know I just don't
trust that science or oh that size looks
good to me
but what are we using to actually make
our decisions
it's not science
but I would go with the people who were
against masks simply because the science
doesn't support it sufficiently
you don't make people do things unless
you've really got the goods
and they don't have the goods so you
can't make people do things under those
conditions
all right ladies and gentlemen is there
a big story I missed I feel like there
was
uh
Eagle Pass
Elon is I think the Eagle Pass so Eagle
Pass is where all the immigrants are
coming in illegally right
Elon Musk is going to the Border
really
well that would be interesting just to
create more
more emphasis on it you know I've got a
real mixed feeling about the immigration
I've told you that before
we definitely have a population collapse
problem but that doesn't mean you should
just let everybody in
laughs
now I I'm no longer going to believe
that the anti
anti-semitic people on YouTube are real
you're you've become too like cartoonish
mayorkus what is mayorkas you're just
being so cartoonish that I don't believe
you're real I believe that you're sent
here to ruin the Stream
right I don't think you're real
I'm not saying there are no real antes
other people they're real but the ones
on here are a little bit too cartoonish
a little bit too on the nose
I'm not believing you're real
uh musk late stage Empire
well the late stage Empire uh is not
just a musk thing a lot of people have
said we look like a late stage Empire
and I would agree we do look like a late
stage Empire about ready to crumble
however
have I ever told you that history
doesn't repeat
it doesn't
it doesn't ever repeat because it can't
history doesn't even have an option to
repeat it
um so anything can happen
yeah I think the Adams love slow-moving
disasters
suggests we'll be fine in the long run
is JB Diamond Irish
all right
yeah it Rhymes yeah people have said
that before the the one thing that's
true is people have the same human
incentives
so that that would be the better way to
say history repeats instead of saying
history repeats just say People Are
People
people will always be people they'll
always be selfish weasels
trying to get ahead
and so from that you can predict a lot
um
yeah
uh YouTube has become like Fortune
people are predictable
why Depeche Mode why are you saying that
why did I see a video about Depeche Mode
and then you're asking me about it is
there some news to that that I don't
know about
did something happen with Depeche Mode
it's just a song
so that was just a weird coincidence
right
Gates spoke about changing scheduling
for cannabis
I'm starting to think Matt Gates is the
rising Superstar here what do you think
I really like him shutting down the
government over the bills not being
voted on separately
yeah I don't I don't think you'll be
popular enough with the left that he
could
get an office necessarily but he's
certainly doing a lot right he also has
this weird history of backing the left
individuals like I think he's backed a
few Democrats who are unfairly attacked
on stuff
so that that's always a good look
uh
obesity is almost non-existent in Europe
so I've told you my uh my diet
experiment
I cut out bread
from my diet which I do sometimes but
usually not completely but this time I
did completely and you know dropped
weight immediately but the most
important thing is all my body
inflammation went away
so I could barely walk upstairs for like
two years and just one way
just all the way now I feel I feel 10
years younger I don't have any health
issues whatsoever
and
I'm fine
I'm fine and it it feels like it was
some kind of sensitivity to the food
yeah well I don't know if it was the
um
it might have been the preservatives not
the wheat so I don't know if it's wheat
or gluten or preservatives or what
but apparently there's some family
sensitivity to to that that I wasn't
aware of
it was the damn Bagels I think the
bagels got me
no flour or sugar yeah maybe it's just
less sugar could be
yeah maybe I will start eating red meat
it's a possibility
I wouldn't rule it out actually
um
yeah
because I only ever did it for my own
health
so if I can improve my health Maybe
I'm not really comfortable with eating
eating meat but maybe if I need it
all right so I got nothing else for you
I'm going to say goodbye to YouTube
thanks for joining
talk to you later
