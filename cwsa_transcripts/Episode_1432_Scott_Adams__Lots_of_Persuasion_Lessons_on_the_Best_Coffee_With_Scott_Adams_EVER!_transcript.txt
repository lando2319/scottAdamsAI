hey everybody
it's time it's time for coffee with
scott adams
the best time of every single day
no doubt about it the argument is over
it's just the best time
and today i have for you
look at these notes yeah content
good content for the first time it's
going to be the best content you've ever
heard and all you need to enjoy it to
his maximum potential is a copper marker
or glass a tanker chelsea steiner
canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and it's going to rock
the entire world like a
5.8 earthquake in california go
oh yeah oh yeah well as some of you have
been uh
following my saga of trying to be
a dumb guy who learns how to do smart
stuff
meaning that i was trying to learn how
to do the proper
sound engineering for this live stream
now if you've been with me from the
beginning you knew it started to be just
holding up my phone and talking to it
and over time i try to
chip away at it to make all the elements
a little bit better you know i'm always
a b
testing let me tell you what happened
recently so i asked on social media
how do i get two sound signals to go
through my
road caster pro mixer so that
my ipad my laptop or two ipads could
have the same sound with one microphone
and many many people gave me suggestions
do you know what happens when you get
lots of good suggestions
and they're all different worthless
turns out that if you get lots and lots
of help
you can't tell what is the good help
because it's all different
if i got lots of advice and it was
largely the same or there was one
let's say one approach that people seem
to favor then i'd say whoa
there we go got something to try but if
a hundred people give you technical
advice
and all 100 are different you have
nothing
because you've got to try all 100 things
and it's basically the same as guessing
so most recently somebody gave me a full
diagram with
details of what cables to buy to make
this connection which
i don't think the equipment is exactly
made to do this
but you you start with these all right
so you got this going into the speaker
holes
and then it goes into one connection but
then the one connection goes back
into a splitter so you've got your
your coming out uh analog right into the
splitter
and then the splitter goes into these
cables and then these cables go into
these little devices into the microphone
part which i think is trying to change
it from analog back to digital and then
it goes back into this
and then it goes into your devices now
how impressive was this somebody had to
figure out
all of these cable types and all of the
you know different transfers and and
redirections to make all this work
and i plugged it in and i'll be damned
it actually worked the sound actually
went from my microphone all the way into
the device
but how many engineers are already
laughing
come on tell me those of you who
actually know what you're doing
how many of you are laughing now some of
you are
i know it you got punked somebody says
no uh yeah it worked but the
the noise was so extreme it wasn't
usable
so you could tell somebody was talking
but there was so much uh
interference it wasn't a useful thing so
that was another week of work and
ordering things and putting things
together and there's one more thing that
did not work
will i be um will i be discouraged by
this
nope nope because every time i do
something that doesn't work
i learn a new thing about engineering
which is
if you've got too many connections and
changes it's probably not going to work
i know what you're saying okay i hear
you you're all saying hire an engineer
hire a producer and even if you don't
want them sitting there with you
at least have them show you how to set
it up once
that's good advice from people who have
never worked with an engineer
have you ever worked with an engineer
let me show you how it goes all right
we're going to make this work and i'll
show you how to
how to do this here's the device you're
going to use you want to come in
and you want to do this that's that's it
that's it just
hit these three buttons in that order
you're done it's going to work every
time
all right give me my paycheck i'm out of
here first day you turn it on
nothing nothing
and you call the engineer and he says oh
did i forget to tell you
that you also have this setting has to
be set here oh okay now i gotta
change the settings it works yay
next day put on the setting
doesn't work so you call up the engineer
he goes
oh did i tell you that sometimes in this
situation
you have to have the setting on and then
do this but do it in a different order
you go okay got it now i have all the
situations
so you do that what happens the next day
yeah the next day it doesn't work so one
of the things you can count on an
engineer to do
is to find a perfect solution that never
works twice
because it's the nature of audio
engineering that you can set it up once
and it just doesn't work the next time
it's it's very common across all the
products
and i know you're going to say get obs
and get all these
the these things that combine things uh
they all have that problem they don't
work twice
so i've tried them all all right moving
on
uh at the billionaire summer camp in sun
valley where
bill gates gave a speech to the other
billionaires who were assembled there
for fun
he gave a speech on climate change
so he's talking about climate change to
all the billionaires so they can do
something about it
uh interrelated news so this is the
daily mail report of this
so many of the attendees flew in on
private jets
to hear the climate change talk that the
air space as far a field as
michigan and canada had to be
temporarily closed let me put it in my
own words
there were so many private jets flying
to the
speech about climate change that it
blocked out the sun
and for a moment the sun couldn't get
through to the earth
and it actually cooled the earth there
were so many private jets in the air
mostly it was shady from michigan to sun
valley
so that's the good news that's the good
news
all right here's something i often
recommend that you do things
wouldn't you say sometimes i give me
advice sometimes i say you know you
should read this article
or you should look at this tweet or you
should maybe follow this person on
twitter
you hear me say that a lot right here's
what i don't often say
but i'm going to say it today stop
everything you're doing
except this as soon as you're done with
this or actually i will give you
permission to stop
this that's how good this thing is that
i'm going to recommend
you could actually stop the live stream
right now
and just go listen to this content it's
pinned at the top of my twitter page
and it's tucker carlson reading an
article
or i don't know if it's a tweet thread
or article from daryl cooper
who i don't know but he's a tremendous
writer
so whoever daryl cooper is oh my god can
he write
let me say that again oh my god
can he write and the reason that tucker
is reading
his piece on tv is that
you've almost never seen anything like
this it is so well written
that your brain just does something i
mean it's weird
and here's what he pulled off that is
very hard to do and sort of the
in some ways it's the holy grail of all
writers so he does what all writers are
trying to do
but not many have ever pulled it off in
the history of
writing which is to take this big
complicated thing that we all experience
in this case he's writing about the 2020
election
and the fact that republicans are
doubters about the outcome
and there's the story is pretty big
because there are a lot of moving parts
and what daryl does which tucker carlson
recognized
and and saw its value as as do i
is that somehow he managed to put all
that
into a logical framework
it was crazy it was so good
so here's my recommendation i don't want
to ruin the content
by you know summarizing it too much but
let me tell you
if you're wondering why it is the
republicans are more doubtful about the
outcome of the election
you're probably saying well that's kind
of obvious i can think of 10 reasons
you have to see his description
it's it's just crazy it's so good and
honestly honestly stop what you're doing
to
to absorb it it's the top of my twitter
feed you know you'll know where to find
it
um there's a tick tock star who's in
trouble because he had some exotic
snakes
and one of them was a zebra cobra
and he let it escape but he didn't tell
anybody for months
and i guess authorities found it and
captured it
but uh here are some fun snake facts
that i just found all right are you
ready for fun
snake facts number one a zebra cobra
can spit venom nine feet
and the venom actually burns you like
acid
oh my god that's the scariest snake i've
ever heard of
first of all i don't like to get within
nine feet of anything called a cobra
but if you do get within nine feet
you're still not too safe
even at nine feet because of that
spinning venom
so we had this spitting venom zebra
snake in some neighborhood and they
finally got it
but here's some other things that we
learned number one
if you have a zebra cobra
or other lethal snake and it gets out
apparently you are legally obliged to
inform law enforcement
that your lethal snake is in the
neighborhood
this tick tock star did not do that so
he's in trouble for that
how many of you would've known that
would you have known
that it was a legal requirement no
obviously it was a
moral and ethical requirement to let
people know there's a deadly snake in
the neighborhood
so i think we all agree on the moral
ethical part
but did you know there was a legal
requirement i wouldn't have known that
here's another one that's weird
apparently he's also in trouble for
mislabeling
the containers of snakes did you know if
you put the wrong label
on your snake container you can get in
legal trouble
i'm not really good at labeling things
i'm not good with details
so i feel like i would not be a good
snake farmer because i'd be mislabeling
all my containers mine would be like
the snake and then there would be like
the other snake
because i don't really know much about
snakes so if i put a bunch of snakes in
the container
i probably wouldn't spend too much time
figuring out the correct label
i'd be like snake number two snake
number three
don't touch the snake all right um
cnn and i didn't think i'd ever live to
see this
but and listen carefully because you're
going to think i'm misspeaking
so hear my words clearly
cnn today reported real news
let me say it again because you probably
don't believe it cnn reported real news
today
it's talking about the city of
charlottesville and they're taking down
their
confederate statues apparently that's
actually
a real thing that's happening now here's
the part that's shocking
they did a story about charlottesville
and confederate statues
they mentioned the unite the right
event and they did not mention
not one mention to the fine people hoax
which normally they had always reported
as fact think about that
cnn did a story about charlottesville
and removing confederate statues and
the unite the right rally that sort of
was the
predecessor of it all
and they didn't mention at all not any
mention
of the fine people hoax
you're welcome and uh shout out to steve
cortez and joel pollock
for pounding on that hoax for
since 2018 right and
we have been pounding that thing and
pounding it
and many of you have been helping on
that by retweeting
the tweets and the articles and stuff
now i'm not going to say we won
but i will say that joe biden stopped
saying the find people hoax
and this is the first time i've seen the
cnn reported it without the hoax
reported as if it were true maybe it's
progress well happy july 10th
today's sort of a important day july
10th
it's a day when some of you will have a
great day today
i guarantee it many of you watching this
are going to go out and have
just a great day other people my enemies
will be
choking on their own bile today
but they know who they are and i'll
leave that to
their imaginations about what's going to
happen today
july 10th some days will be good
some days will not all right uh
biden reversed another trump policy
on pregnant aliens
now these are not my words i'm using the
words
from the news they're referring to
the topic here as a policy on pregnant
aliens
uh i assume this is something about the
ufos
i didn't read all the details but
apparently uh
trump had a policy that if you were
pregnant
and you were an alien and you came to
the united states
that they would detain you or not on a
case-by-case
basis but now biden has reversed that
because it was cruel and evil they say
and instead the pregnant anybody who's
pregnant
indoor nursing will not be detained
so no detaining for anybody who's
pregnant
so no pregnant aliens will be detained
so if you see a lot of pregnant aliens
um
and you can usually tell them because
they have antennae
and uh they might be green for example
um possibly have different number of
eyes or
features but you also notice i'm very
pregnant
and you want to stay away from them if
you've ever seen
a pregnant alien and here i'm assuming
we're talking about space aliens
because i didn't read the article but it
seems obvious with all the ufos this
must be what it's about
uh let me do my impression of a pregnant
alien
okay
i'm gonna say that wasn't my best
impression
but that was what a pregnant alien looks
like
let's see how about that
sorry about that i just got so excited
um all right uh
here's some disappearing news stories
all right i'm gonna build a little uh
theme here about disappearing news
and it starts with a story about uh uh
the
the washington post editorial board is
writing had a uh a piece that said why
are unions and democrats
so opposed to giving poor children a
choice in schooling
and i thought to myself the reason that
this was being tweeted around
is that it's rare that it's rare
it's rare that the washington post
especially a left-leaning publication
would even have the topic you know it
looks like an opinion piece
but would even have this topic about
opposing school choice and it's bad for
poor children
and here's what i asked you does this
seem like
the left leaning news which is the main
news we'll get to the mike sornovich
part of this
um doesn't it seem that the news has
disappeared the story of school choice
right the news has just disappeared that
story
and you don't realize
until somebody plays it you don't
realize just
jesus christ
bastards all right i'm gonna fix my
microphone a little bit
but don't talk about the audio
anymore
the problems on your side if you've got
an audio problem all right so enough
about that
um so we're seeing a situation in which
the whole school choice
debate is basically treated as not an
issue
when it might be the the best issue the
most important issue in the country
in my opinion if you were to pick the
one most important thing it would be
school choice certainly fixing the the
you know the options for black americans
and
anybody who's low income who doesn't
have a good school
but we don't really see much debate on
that in the in the news do we
we don't have much debate on that and so
you can see that the news decides
not only what is news but what we even
debate on
they just keep it out of the news and
it's just not a story
so um we're going to tie some stories
together here but let me let me do the
stories first
um let's say you want to follow the
science
because that's a good idea right and
let's say you were in california and you
read that
today the cdc said
on friday i guess yesterday that fully
vaccinated teachers and students do not
need to wear masks so that's what the
cdc says
now do you think that the cdc is using
science
to make their decisions well i think
they are right it's the cdc
probably using science so what did
california do
when the cdc said you don't need masks
if you're fully vaccinated
california followed the science in the
opposite direction
and said oh you totally are going to
need masks to go back to school
 you you
 you governor newsome
now i gotta say i have not been too
engaged in the
recall newsome um saga
you know i prefer it i think that you
know he's worthy of recall
but i don't know what the odds are the
odds are low i think that he actually
gets recalled
but that process is underway
and when i see that california is
ignoring science
or at least cdc's version of science
which actually is people friendly
i say to myself why is that can you give
me some reason california
in which your guidelines would be
different and it turns out there is a
reason
all right so now the cdc says you don't
need masks if you vaccinated to go back
to school
california says you do and here's
california's reason
that they're disagreeing with the cdc
okay here's california's reason
at the outset of the new year students
should be able to walk into school
without worrying about whether they will
feel different or
singled out for being vaccinated
or unvaccinated treating all kids the
same
will support a calm and supportive
school environment
are you kidding me
really are you kidding me
california is saying directly
that they're going to ignore the science
because it will make kids feel better
and not tease each other about being
vaccinated or not vaccinated
are you kidding me you
idiots
you're gonna send kids who are fully
vaccinated into school and make them
wear a
 mask all day really you've gone
too far
too far too far
so i'm gonna give you in a little bit
a plan for how to beat newsome in
in the recall now i hadn't been like i
said i haven't been
involved in any way but there is a very
clear path to beat him
especially with this mask thing the mask
stuff alone should be enough to kick him
out of office
right unless the governor comes out
against that and i don't think it's
going to happen
that should be the end of him as soon as
you go against the cdc's recommendation
for masks that that should be it
that you don't even need to talk about
other things really
that's it um because you're going to
piss off
kids and their moms
forget about the dads because nobody
cares about dads
but you're going to piss off the kids
and their moms and this is going to be
some trouble
and i'm going to add to this trouble in
a little bit
but here's my plan for beating governor
newsom
now this requires a good candidate right
so i'm going to tell you what a good
candidate could do
to win the election the perfect
candidate
would be a socially liberal republican
so that's the first start you have to be
socially liberal
because it's california there's just no
way around it you know you're not going
to get elected unless you're
socially on the right page and um arnold
schwarzenegger was a good example
so schwarzenegger was clearly socially
liberal but he was a republican
otherwise
on the hard-headed stuff and that's kind
of what you're going to need
but here's the specific plan that would
win the governorship
in california number one propose
uh pairing nuclear power plants
small ones the new designs that are
safer with desalinization
and build a lot of them now you say to
yourself but scott that would take 20
years
and everybody opposes nuclear and
desalinization takes so much energy
that it's not cost effective well it's
more cost effective if you put it next
to a
nuclear power plant and here's the thing
much like build the wall feel the visual
i want to put a nuclear power plant next
to a desalination plant
and we want to do this pair of things
all over california
so that we have enough water and enough
energy forever
and we've also dealt with climate change
and we've done it in the most scientific
way
now that message is really visual
and it's also a complete solution but
you're gonna have to beat the fact
that it takes 20 years to do it so
you're going to have to
lead with a republican message that
you've got to get rid of the regulations
and the
namba stuff and you're going to have to
really educate the public
on why they need this so you would say
number one i got to educate the public
that they think that the old nuclear is
the dangerous stuff
and it's not going to be the old nuclear
that we're proposing
we're proposing the newer you know at
least generation three
but probably generation four we're
proposing that we
go hard at getting rid of deregul
regulations
maybe get the federal government
involved in some way
but the visual of nuclear plus
desalinization
even if it takes longer than you think
is a solution
and it would be the first time anybody's
anybody had one
right even if it's hard
at least it's a solution what is the
other solution
more solar panels no there isn't really
any other solution
so you would be the only governor who's
even proposing a freaking plan
how about this you're a republican you
say we know that
california is going to catch on fire any
moment now apparently it's going to be
the worst
fire season of all time because it's the
driest
and what is the governor's forest
management plan
do you know i don't know i live here
i live in a state that's going to be
literally on fire
within weeks within weeks i won't be
able to go outdoors
literally i won't be able to go outdoors
because the air quality will be too low
and i don't know what my governor is
even doing about it
so if you're going to run against him
come up with a forest management plan
and tell us what it is
i just want to hear one it could be that
newsome has a plan or even that he's
working on it or even that he's doing a
good job i don't know
but i'm not hearing about it so you
could beat him on that
next of course you would say no masks
for kids in school that's enough to win
the election
really if you just did that one thing if
you weren't
bad on anything else and you said look
i'll do the same thing nuisance doing
but no masks in school i'll just take
his entire platform
i'll do everything he's going to do with
one change
just one change i'm just not going to
require mass in schools
he you would get elected immediately
because people will say well we like
newsome but except for that mass thing
so we'll vote for you
now i'm exaggerating a little bit to
make a point uh of course you'd want to
be strong on crime
and also on forcing addicts into
treatment
sort of a maybe a doctor drew michael
schellenberger
kind of approach to things that make
sense and basically all the smart people
would agree with it
really and then here's my
uh kicker for you are you ready here's
the really persuasive part
because if you want to get attention
you've got to say some controversial
things right
here's the most controversial thing
you'll ever hear from
from potentially from this suppose you
were a republican
running for governor in california and
you knew that the democrats were going
to call you a racist
and if you came out against critical
race theory
well then they'd really call you a
racist so how do you come out
against critical race theory without
being against
critical race theory and still get
attention and still get elected
here's how you favor it
you say i'm totally in favor of critical
race theory
as long as there's also school choice
yeah because it is a world in which
parents do get to decide
somewhat how their kids are socialized
so if you want your kids to be
socialized in a critical race theory
intersectionality kind of thing there
will be options for that
if you want your kids to not be exposed
to that
we'll give you some options for that but
we've got to have school choice
and it's and we've got to push as hard
as we can for school choice
because if we get that you and i don't
have to argue about what your kids are
being taught versus mind
i'll just send my kids where they get
taught what i want them to teach
i'm not done yet not done yet
i would also say in addition to critical
race theory
which if you would like to teach it to
your kids i'm all for it because it has
some good
good points to it so you and you have to
say it has good points
so you start with oh yeah there's
definitely institutional racism
lots of work to be done critical race
theory gives us a good
framework for it but there are
legitimate criticisms to it
and parents get to decide um i would say
this
if you're going to teach critical race
theory which says that you're being
let's say your progress or your future
is being
limited by race if that's what we're
going to teach kids
it is only ethical and moral that you
also teach them life strategy
yeah wouldn't you like it if the kid who
learns that race is what's holding him
back
could simultaneously learn some strategy
that says look
but because of this racial imbalance
stuff
you could go to any fortune 500 company
let's say you're a black
uh woman you know or whatever
you could go to any fortune 500 company
and say look
i've got all the qualifications you're
looking for
as do the other applicants right i might
not even be more qualified than the
other applicants
but you need some diversity it's your
number one
it's one of your top goals and i can
give you diversity
i'm also just as good as the other
applicants i have all the qualifications
you will get that job basically every
time
right so if you're a republican say
i embrace critical race theory and what
it teaches but it's teaching you to be
helpless
unless you augment it make it better
improve on it
tell you what to do about it right get
some school choice
go to a fortune 500 company use their
own policies to your advantage
strategy would you oppose that
well if you do you've got school choice
and on intersectionality as i've said
before i would embrace it
as a republican and i would say you know
this is a perfectly good conversation
for everybody to understand how people
are being discriminated against but why
would we limit it
let's expand it embrace it to death
and add republicans as a category of
people who are discriminated against
or let's say just say non-democrats
i'm going to give you an example of a
non-democrat
who is being discriminated against right
now
it's a real thing it's in the headlines
well
it's on twitter anyway didn't make it to
the headlines um
but we'll talk about that in a moment so
you should add the categories of people
who are short
ugly old republican christian and
make sure that you know that all the
categories that are discriminated
against are accounted for
and then just be in favor of it the
candidate that i just described
especially if they said they'll work on
lowering your taxes
and making it a better business
environment i think would get elected
easily
yeah in boldness right i think that
candidate would get it elected easily
but it would have to be a schwarzenegger
type of person
who is republican in the hard-nosed
stuff but
has all the the social equality goals
of maybe maybe an arnold schwarzenegger
i'm not i won't say that he has goals
for that but he's socially uh liberal
so somebody's suggesting dave rubin to
run for governor
he'd be great you know as i'm just
thinking about it
if you were would dave rubin be like the
best governor
like he might actually be because he
seems completely
um immune from the the politics of stuff
so what would be better than a married
gay man
running for governor who is not wed to
any
political ideology and would just like
to make things work
he'd be a really strong candidate i
don't think he has interest in it but
he has all the tools definitely the
communication tools
all right here's a
trend i've been watching just give you
an update on it there's a company called
mighty homes
that do these uh kit homes now when i
say kit
it doesn't mean the homeowner can put it
together but they they make
you know just panels and windows that
just
you know they they hook together in
order and
it's really easy to assemble them now
some people say hey these are not
attractive enough
or whatever and that's something that
will
of course improve in the future but keep
in mind that most homes are not
attractive
how often do you drive past a home and
say well that's an attractive home
homes are not really attractive so if
you could make the cost lower
and make it easier to build you'd have
something
but as many have pointed out the local
zoning laws
make it nearly impossible to do any kind
of construction that's not the normal
kind
so how do you get past the really it's
just a total
roadblock of all the local ordinances
and i would just say this there probably
isn't any way
you probably can't get past it without
you know working every state
individually and it'd be a mess but
imagine if you will a president trump
somebody who understands you know
building and construction and knows
about all the
all the obstacles to it do we need
a federal set of building guidelines
that if you meet them the federal ones
they would supersede any local ones
now i don't know what that problems that
would be constitutionally
uh you know it would be of course
usurping power from the states
but would people mind would we be worse
off
would it work i'm seeing lots of no no
no oh god no
no keep in mind what i'm saying is that
the states
keep their rules just as they are
the key the states keep their rules but
the only exception would be the kit
homes that would have a
sort of a federal blessing if they met
certain standards
so i'm seeing people have a in the
comments is pretty interesting
i'm seeing lots of comments along the
lines of
you don't want the federal government to
have more control
i get that i get that plunging home
values somebody says really i don't know
i don't think so why would the home
values plunge
because these would be good homes we're
not talking about building trailer parks
i'm talking about attractive homes that
just don't cost that much
oh build it building is the most local
activity
so you want your control to be driven
down to the most local level
i get that but we have a very specific
problem
which is if you allow the control at the
local level
you can never improve your your your
building
uh process um now let me
let me stop all of you from saying oh
it's like
the sears homes kits no
nothing like that and then some of you
are going to say it's like tiny homes oh
i get it
tiny homes no i'm not talking about
anything like the sears kits of long ago
i'm not talking about anything like a
tiny home i'm talking about using
current technology not ancient
technology
current technology to do something way
better
different than anything that's ever been
done before and i'm not talking about
making them small
make them a full-size regular home
just less expensive so that's coming and
mighty homes is one example of it
and i would say that even the mighty
homes model which looks really good
it looks like a pretty well thought out
model but
it's probably the model a you know if
you're going to look at the automobile
industry it's like a model a
um yes and there's things called
sips structural integrated panels is
that what
stands for so that's been around for a
while
but i think the thing that they do wrong
is they make these giant panels that you
need a crane to put up
you can't you make the panels like one
foot by one foot
so you just snap them together like
legos put them on the back of a pickup
truck
unload them one at a time and then the
homeowner just snaps them together
do you really need the whole panel to be
delivered
by a crane i don't know i feel like
there's
improvement to be made there um
i love the story of these spotify
employees who are mad about joe rogan's
content
are you following that
sparky says there are different
environments across the usa
yeah you would you would have a
different kit for
every environment that's right so your
your winter kit and your summer kits
or your warm weather kit would look
different but you could work all that
out
so you just have a set of a set of
requirements for
all of those options um
so the spotify employees are mad at joe
rogan and
this story is the most
delightfully um you know useless story
like none of this matters to any of us
but i love the word
still upset it's the still that makes it
funny
because when i first read the story
spotify employees are
upset with joe rogan's podcast i thought
oh there's a story
you know joe rogan has done something
that makes these employees upset
and that's worth knowing about
interesting media story
but time goes by
and they add the word still spotify
employees still upset
they're still upset and for some reason
that's funny
because they they can't find a way to be
happy
i can't imagine going to work and i got
you know i could see
if somebody had a you know bad feeling
about some specific opinion that joe
rogan had
i could see that they would express it
and i could even see that they might
tell management
but if weeks have gone by and this is
still your biggest problem
is the stuff that joe rogan said on the
wait for it
stuff that joe rogan said on the wait
for it
most popular podcast in the
world
maybe you should get over it because
it's the most popular podcast
in the world he's doing something right
because you couldn't be doing something
wrong
and also has the most popular podcast
in the whole world so he's got
that going for him
but these spotify employees i i would
just love to see a photo of the spotify
employees that are upset
because don't you know that that would
be a funny picture if you just took all
the ones that are mad at joe rogan
and just said like we'd like a group
picture
oh no reason no reason we just think
you're awesome
so we'd like just like to take a group
picture
see what you look like don't you think
that would be a funny picture
know it would that would be an
interesting group of people
but here's the funniest part what if
none of this is true
or what if it's a little bit true but it
got exaggerated have you ever heard
of better marketing spotify
is getting all this national attention
about joe rogan who they just paid a
they're gonna pay a hundred million
dollars to for his show so they've got
this enormous investment
and they really need to promote it if
they just did
advertisements how effective would that
be well it'd help
right i'm sure they did that but what
could be better
than saying spotify's own employees are
trying to get it kicked off
the air and by the way it's the most
popular thing in the country
you couldn't beat that this is the best
marketing i've ever seen
all right here's a funny story true
story there was an internet
personality test you've seen those who
knows how much
science i doubt there's much of it
behind it but uh
christina and i both took the
personality test
and one of the things they do and it's
one of these you know it comes up with
an
intj whatever those uh
kinds of personality profiles
so i don't think there's much science to
it but they're fun to do and i did mine
and
both christine and i answered the same
set of questions
so i saw her questions and i saw her
answer and she saw mine
it's the same set of questions and when
i answered them just with my own answers
it decided that i'm an advocate
personality
so an advocate according to this
personality test is the rarest of all
personality types
and people who share it the same
personality as
i have according to this test would be
mother teresa
so mother teresa would come out the same
on this uh
martin luther king feeling pretty good
feeling pretty good about that and
nelson mandela
look at me so those are the three people
who would have the same personality
profile as i do
mother teresa martin luther king and
nelson mandela
it's just another reason i identify as
black because i'm with
you know two out of three awesome people
plus mother teresa
who is living well not living but she's
uh
on the road to sainthood so you know
i don't know i'm not really nominated
for sainthood yet
but i don't see any reason it was out of
my reach
so that's what i came up with i'm an
advocate in the
model of those three people christina
did the same test
um and she came out that she has the
same personality type
that uh movie bad guys are based on
and she is associated with the
personality type of
vladimir putin
all right moving on
there's a head of the social security
administration
by the way i don't think these
personality tests are scientific so
i'm just joking um the george costanza
strategy
looks like it's going to come into play
do you remember george costanza
from seinfeld um
he uh he got i guess he quit his job on
seinfeld once
and then not he quit his job in the
fictional story
and he didn't want to quit he changed
his mind so he just went back to work
and pretended that he had not quit
i'm looking at some funny pictures going
by on the locals chat
so on if you're chatting on locals where
this live stream is also playing
you can include photos and videos and
stuff
so i'm watching those go by anyway the
head of the social security
administration this guy andrew saul
biden fired him but he's refusing to
leave his job
he's using the george costanza strategy
you're fired am i
no you're fired you're totally fired
am i no you really you're fired
pack up your stuff pack up my stuff
i'm working remotely okay well in like a
virtual sense
pack up your stuff and get out of here
you're fired
i'm gonna log in on monday no you're
fired
you can't you can't come to work anymore
you're fired
completely gone you have nothing to do
with this agency anymore
see you monday now i guess the
background of the story is
that uh trump appointed this uh person
and i i guess he's protected
for the term of his appointment and he's
he's employing the you know his right to
stay in the job
but seriously if the president of the
united states
fires you does it matter if your
contract or the rule
said that you don't have to go i mean
you know maybe he's good at his job
maybe he's not
does that matter if the president of the
united states
says you're fired even if the president
of the united states
for some weird reason doesn't have that
power to fire you
shouldn't you leave i mean seriously
like i'm not the person who's going to
argue that trump appointed people
all need to get fired so i don't know
anything about how he does
his job but if the president fires you
maybe leave maybe the right thing to do
is just leave
all right even though he doesn't have to
i guess
um i feel as if
this story needs to be part of a class
curriculum
you some of you have heard this by now
so mike cernovich
independent journalist author and
filmmaker mike
mike czernovich which is how he's
described on publications that like him
when a publication that doesn't like him
describes him
they do not call him an independent
journalist
author and filmmaker although those are
the things he is
among other things but
he did a i guess he did some
investigation and found out there's a
link
between the far left southern poverty
law center
the splc a group that demonizes and
dehumanizes conservatives well according
i think this was the
where was it some article i read anyway
he wrote a report and the title of it is
how a convicted terrorist
used the southern poverty law center's
website to identify
targets so in other words somebody
looked at who this
splc says is a bad person and decided to
go kill that bad person
because the sblc called them out now
that feels like
an article you want to see doesn't it if
you found out that some
organization that is supposed to be
protecting us from bad people
which is the alleged point of the splc
to help uh or that they help the uh
social media platforms decide who should
be
de-platformed or or you know de-boosted
i guess
and so that's their job their job is
to make sure that we know who the bad
people are
turns out that they helped a bad person
find and
try to kill somebody so cervix writes
this
report and here's the story that makes
it kind of special
google erased it if you do a
a google search for the exact title of
his
um i'm assuming it's on a web page now
called how a convicted terrorist used
the southern poverty law center's
website to identify targets
if you put that full search in there do
you know what comes up
wouldn't you think that his article
would come up
nope the splc
comes up a whole bunch of splc stuff
that's not about that article
now suppose you go to duckduckgo and put
in that same search where does mike
cernovich
where does his article come up on
duckduckgo
first first
where he should be because there is
exactly one thing on the internet
only one that has this title it's mike
cernovich's
new blockbuster very important
report doesn't exist on google
think about that don't you believe
that children should be taught about
media
brainwashing and manipulation
can you imagine sending a child into the
world who still believes that the news
is real that's a real dangerous
situation
do you want your do you want to create a
bunch of new citizens the young people
coming up
do you want them to think the news is
real
that's really really dangerous and i
think this would be like a
this could be like a case study the high
schoolers could
look at and say look here's an example
where
a story that was important and true by
the way
did anybody challenge the truth of it
not so far all right did the splc say
oh the facts in that story are incorrect
i don't think so it's not being removed
for being untrue
and it wasn't removed for being let's
say violating any kinds of terms of
service
they just didn't want it there they just
didn't want it there and that they
changed reality
right this needs to be taught in schools
imagine a high school student thinking
that everything that they're told on cnn
is true
that would be such a disabling belief
all right um
and that is my blockbuster
oh i gotta run gotta run right now bye
for now
