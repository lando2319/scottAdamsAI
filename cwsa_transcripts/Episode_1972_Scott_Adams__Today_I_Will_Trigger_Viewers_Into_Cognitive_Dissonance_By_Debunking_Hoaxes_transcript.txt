bubble
good morning everybody and welcome
to coffee with Scott Adams the highlight
of your life and civilization itself I
don't think there's been a finer day
but wait till tomorrow even better
how would you like to experience some
beverage with a little cognitive
dissonance some of you will be triggered
by today's uh well a lot of you actually
maybe maybe two-thirds of you will be
experiencing some serious
cognitive dissonance
and I'm doing it intentionally so before
we start you should know that that's
going to happen to two-thirds of you but
you don't know which ones might be you
might be somebody else now if it happens
to you you're just going to get angry
and you're going to swear that nothing
like that happened
your reaction will be I'm not in
cognitive dissonance darn it the words I
say are making complete sense
but they won't
they won't they'll be on the wrong topic
and everything else all right but before
we get into that how would you like to
take your energy up to a level that
almost nobody has ever experienced
before of course you do and all you need
is a cover among your glass a tanker
jealous Diana canteen geographlass a
vessel of any kind
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here the thing
that makes everything better
it's called this simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
Craig says give it to me
trigger me
well I will
I will
so yesterday I uh a bought
told me that Elon Musk started following
me on Twitter
which gets you a lot of attention it
turns out because when the Bots say that
he follows somebody you know people
definitely notice that
now he he has been following the the
Dilbert Twitter account
for I don't know several months but now
he's following a following me so
I I guess I don't have any extra comment
on that
but how many times have I told you
that what we've created here with this
live stream
is something fairly substantial like a
it's almost like an augmentation to the
Constitution or the Republic
uh and what I mean by that is it's an
efficient way
for opinions to Bubble Up and get to the
right people
so to the extent that your opinions you
know are let's say Unified on some topic
and to the extent which I tweet about it
you've got more visibility now so you so
your visibility all went up so when I
say that you know Elon Musk is following
my Twitter account that really is about
you as well because you know it's all
part of one process
all right
um remember I told you that I wanted
representative Santos who is now seems
to be the biggest liar Congress has ever
known
um I wanted him to keep his job
specifically because why
why did I say he should keep his job
do you remember
because it would be funny
when the other members of Congress say
he should quit because he's a liar
now you can't tell me that won't be
funny
and sure enough Eric swalwell has
weighed in
Eric swalwell
to suggest that you should be
investigated for being such a liar
now is that not funny
you you do not disagree
that is funny
I don't have to add anything to that do
I there's like
there's no work for the professional
humorist
the professional humorist may take the
day off
because the the straight line or the
setup does all the work all right here's
my joke of the day
Eric swalwell says that you can't have
Liars in Congress
and I'm done
set up and punchline set up in punchline
all in one little knee package you can't
beat that
as a professional humorist
I appreciate the efficiency of this
situation so keep that Santos guy in
office we want to see I want to see Adam
Schiff
rail against this liar
I'd also like to see CNN bring on John
Brennan to say we could never have a
liar like this in government
oh uh Eric just because he's a dick
that's all
so be an addict to me is reason for
being blocked
all right
um
Peter Sweden who I believe at one point
was banned on Twitter but he's back and
he's he's one of the people who's
notable for saying things about the
pandemic
which are not mainstream
medical beliefs
now I'm not saying that he is right or
wrong
and we're in we're going to enter the
the cognitive dissonance territory okay
now here's the first way you can
identify which one is used or getting
triggered because because a lot of you
are going to get triggered the first way
is you won't be able to stay on topic
all right so look for the people who
make
very excited comments that might be true
might be true facts might not be but
they won't quite be on topic it'll be
sort of in the same zip code
but it'll be like they're intentionally
missing the point all right you ready
let's do this so Peter Sweden
notable uh you know pandemic let's say
what would I say uh pandemic
uh what What's the name for somebody who
says something that's not popular
a but not a not a negative way
polemic no Rogue
Rogue to Center dissenter
contrarian contrarian that's it I got it
okay thank you you got me contrarian is
the word I'm looking for because I
wanted a word that doesn't say anything
about whether he's right or wrong can we
agree on that right so rule number one
we're not saying whether he or his
points are good or bad so if any of you
were to make a point in the next few
minutes and say but his point is good
you're off topic all right you ready
let's see how many people will go off
topic to show that they're in cognitive
distance
he uh tweeted a picture of the vares
report
and showed that there's you know
gigantic number of reports in the fairs
database for pandemic related stuff okay
it doesn't even matter what for our
purposes doesn't matter what just a huge
number of uh extra
verse meaning uh that there were
negative reports of maybe a side effect
from I think the vaccination
now
you all you all know that the Veris
reports are not substitutes for
randomized controlled trials
you agree right it's simply people
saying hey
you might want to look into this and if
lots of people are reporting the same
thing well then you definitely want to
look into it so can we all agree that if
the Vera's report shows and the anomaly
that the way you treat that is not as a
fact
but it's something you definitely want
to look into everybody agree so far
okay so I tweeted that I was glad that
Twitter had added a context note
the context note basically debunked the
the interpretation of the vares thing
and also mentioned that anybody can put
things under errors Etc
now
what do you think of that so my comment
is that the context notes from Twitter
are are good
now your comment which will be off topic
is
you can't do randomized control top
right that's off topic cognitive
dissonance who else
who else can't deal with the fact that
it's simply a context question
got
I block somebody's wife and he says I'm
jealous
anybody else
come on come on man make an argument for
why the Bears report is right or wrong
which is totally not the topic
oh I I got everybody quiet today
nobody wants to change the topic
I warned you too much all right so is
everybody here on the same on the same
wavelength
that a gigantic anomaly uh a gigantic
anomaly
is worth looking into
but it's not a confirmation of anything
right okay good
um
yeah all right so that's good you did
really well on that do you think you'll
do as well
on the next one
let's see
by the way I'm quite proud of you
my
I guess my objective you know I've got a
number of things I always like to
accomplish but among them
I would like
my audience to be the most sophisticated
um analyzers of the news the people who
know immediately what's wrong like you
see it immediately
and I'm going to give you another one in
a minute that's going to be really tough
for you this was the starter this was
just the appetizer it's going to get
tougher
all right
here it is
I ran a poll I said how many of you
believe some group of Elites or leftists
and this could include Bill Gates right
so he could be on your list but how many
believe some group of Elites or leftists
were somewhat important wants to reduce
the population of Earth
how many say that that is a true
statement that there are some Elites
some people in power we want to reduce
the population of Earth
a lot of you say yes some say no
but some say yes
now
how many of you let me ask more
specifically how many of you have seen
Bill Gates either a video
or Celia's quote where he directly says
he says it directly in a video and also
to quote that he's looking to wants to
reduce the population of Earth how many
of you have seen those
I've seen a lot of yeses yeses now those
of you who have seen those things do you
know their their hoaxes
here comes the cognitive distance
the video of Bill Gates saying directly
that he wants population reduction it's
actually a voice over
it's just a hoax it's not even his voice
but there's also a quote that says it
directly right I mean there's a quote of
real words that came out of his mouth
that say it directly right another isn't
no that doesn't exist
is widely quoted but it doesn't exist
there's a larger quote which they
rupared whoever did it somebody rupart
it they took a real quote and combined
it they changed his context so if you
see it out of context it looks exactly
like
he wants to reduce the population the
actual context is he's talking about
reducing something else
it's actually not even about population
so you can't actually find any evidence
of Bill Gates wanting to reduce the
population now
how many of you believe me
how many of you believe me that there's
that it's a hoax and a well-documented
one we know exactly we know exactly what
the real video says and we know what the
hoax says we know exactly what the real
quote says and we know what the hoax
says how many believe me
that is a hoax just the Bill Gates part
just the Bill Gates part
yeah
all right now if there's anybody left
who still believes that Bill Gates
is interested in population decline
I don't mean to insult you
but what I'm going to do next it might
be a little tough for some of you right
this is not personal
I'm not trying to insult you I genuinely
I I'm trying to make sure I have the
most educated live stream
all right this will be a little tough
but I think you can handle it
on the Bill Gates population decline
you should not have had to do a fact
check
you should not have had to research that
here's why
it doesn't pass the really test you know
where you go really
because
up to around this is just my guess an IQ
of about 120.
uh you could you could imagine that
people maybe don't understand how
population and Economics work together
in other words if you believe that
reducing the population of Earth could
ever be good for Earth
that you don't understand economics and
population
you might understand economics alone
without the population you might
understand a population
but you don't understand that a growing
population is
absolutely required for economic
stability
is required there's no way around it
everybody at Bill Gates IQ level
knows that everybody
all right now that's your challenge find
somebody that you believe is well above
average
and ask them
what's better for the economy
a growing population
or a shrinking population
they'll all give you the same answer
it will be 100 of the people will say oh
it has to grow
but
you want to grow wisely
right it has to grow but it should be a
controlled smart growth you don't want
to wildly just overpopulate
now
um
some people
say that in that there's a Rockefeller
you know Shady Rockefeller group they're
recommended back in 1975
that the the policy of the United States
should be to reduce you know out of
control population growth true or false
that in 1975
it was believed that population growth
was the problem true true well I was
that age you know I'm old enough to
remember it everybody was worried all
the smart people the the people up here
they were all worried that the
population was getting out of control
but
smart people watched what happened when
countries got richer
and they learned that wait a minute
every single time a country gets richer
the birth rate goes down
so it turned out it was like a
self-correcting problem
now
I read a little poll and I asked how
many of you believe some group of Elites
or whatever want to reduce the
population of Earth
72 percent of you said yes
you're all wrong
this this one is clean cut there are a
lot of things that we talk about where a
difference in opinion or priorities
different of like projections and stuff
you could have lots of reasons to
disagree but this isn't one of them
this is this is one that there is no
room for actual disagreement it's almost
like physics it would be like
disagreeing with gravity right you need
a growing population to have a good
economy and every person who pays
attention
and it's at least a little bit smart
they all know it there's there are no
Elite people who want to reduce the
population of Earth none but you might
hear people say you know there might be
say some African country that's getting
ahead of itself right so you can easily
imagine some individual place has more
population growth than locally they can
grow food but that's not that's not the
big picture
yeah now how many of you are are saying
to yourself huh I used to think that
there were smart people who want to
reduce the population of Earth but now
that you've explained it this way I can
see your point
how many people have I convinced to
change their mind
right if you haven't changed your mind
about this you're in cognitive
dissonance
this one this one is not the kind where
there's any room for disagreement there
really isn't
you won't find any disagreement
for people who understand the topic and
are reasonably smart none now if you'd
like to test this
I'd like you to find that person in your
own life
see if you can find a person
who actually has the opinion you believe
is widespread
nobody now you might say yourself but
Scott we're only talking about the
elites the elites definitely want you
know less population maybe not smart
people in general but the elites
no they don't it would be terrible for
the elites the elites don't want a
shrinking population because those are
their customers they want more people
paying taxes more people buying their
stuff they only want more people
right but again
in a controlled way not not enough and a
control growth
all right
um
how many people said when I asked
you know is there a group of Elites blah
blah blah
so apparently uh the people who said you
never know
I think are
the same as the you know as close to a
quarter of the people said you never
know
but you do know
I I don't want to make fun of a corner
of the people who answered this poll but
it's right out that 25 thing just keeps
on working
the the wrong answer is you don't know
if I read this poll again
you should all be able to answer that
you definitely know no there's nobody
nobody has that opinion in the elites it
is a non-existent opinion
is this how many of you are having like
the biggest mind of your life right
now because you are positive that was
true
how many of you were positive it was
true
until like just now
well 72 percent of my polls said they
were positive it was true just this just
an hour ago
yeah
now is anybody having a negative feeling
about me because I would be cognitive
dissonance too is anybody thinking oh no
he's not trying to help us he's part of
the elite do you think I'm part of the
elite who's trying to pull the wool over
your eyes for what what reason would
that be
what we what reason would I have to try
to dupe you on this question
none
I don't know if it's because I primed
you so well
but uh
I think you're doing well you're
handling this very well
those of you who are not changing your
mind you know you already do the
population growth was good are you
watching what's happening this is kind
of remarkable it's kind of remarkable
because I would have expected far more
word salad
so I feel like maybe we are
accomplishing something
you know if if the only thing I could
accomplish
is that my audience would learn how to
change their mind without cognitive
dissonance
that would be amazing
do you realize that what a what an
upgrade to your thinking process that
would be if you could actually learn
to just change your mind it's the weird
it's the rarest of talents
but I feel like maybe this is a group
that's better at it you know through
filtering
yeah
um
this is pure denial says Vince well
Vince
is pure denial
so you believe that there are some even
though the there's no evidence of it
whatsoever and nobody's smart would ever
believe it you still believe this really
big trick
all right well let's move on
there was a new study
that said that women can detect who's
married versus unmarried by sniffing
their t-shirts and looking at their
photos
do you see any problem with this let's
see how trained you are to identify
 studies
so women can identify a single men by
sniffing their t-shirts while looking at
pictures
now
don't you think that looking at the
picture part is the important part
do you think the sniffing was how they
figured it out or do you think it was
just looking at the picture
because I'm not a woman but I can pick
out married men by the picture
is there anybody who wouldn't I be able
to identify married men by the picture
yeah you can
you totally can you absolutely can and
one of the things that we know
is that single people have higher
testosterone
how many of you knew that
that your testosterone goes down as soon
as you get married and especially if
kids are around if kids are around your
testosterone just disappears practically
yeah now in testosterone absolutely
changes how you look you know in the
long run a lot you know can make you
rounder and softer
versus more angular and cut
uh but even in the short run I think
even in the short run because
testosterone is entirely the chemical
that makes men happy
how many women do this by the way
that uh you know we all need our
dopamine and our I don't know serotonin
whatever but
but the difference between happy and
unhappy for a man is their testosterone
you can actually feel a high
testosterone day
if you're male would you can you guys
confirm this
men you can feel a high testosterone day
and you can feel a low testosterone day
and the high testosterone days you can
do anything
like you have no fear
the the biggest fear I have when my
testosterone is like clearly High the
biggest fear I have is that I don't have
any fear
and that's a problem
right yes and you know it what is
happening
like there are days I'm walking down the
street and I think God I hope nobody
starts a fight with me today because I
think I would just end them and it has
nothing to do with being angry it
wouldn't even be about temper it would
just be you get your business done it's
just a feeling of well if I if I have to
kill that attacker I guess I'll get on
it right it's just this feeling of
overwhelming capability
now you don't think you could pick that
up in somebody's eyes
you don't think you can pick somebody
who who knows their testosterone has
been drained from them
versus somebody who's like
you're ready to go you can totally tell
by looking at the face
now
can they also
detect the scent
I think so probably probably
for example
um
if you're smelling a married person's
t-shirt you might smell the desperation
[Laughter]
yeah dogs can smell fear
if a dog can smell fear I'm pretty sure
a woman could smell a married man
you can't be that different
basically the same problem
all right
now
I've got a prediction
been making this prediction for a while
but because of the pandemic I think the
society is ready for it
there's there is in front of us at some
point in our near future a real big
Reckoning
public Reckoning with birth control
pills
because as you know a birth control pill
changes the hormonal you know situation
of a woman
and
as many but not all people will tell you
anecdotally
it seems to change their personalities
and scientifically
women are less attracted to their mates
when they're on birth control
which actually makes perfect sense
because you would you would imagine that
evolution
would make you hornier when you're able
to have babies and less horny when
you're not and and I think you know the
monthly cycle demonstrates that now
that's not guaranteed I suppose but it
makes sense you know you you would
totally expect women to be less
attracted in any situation in which
they're not fertile and know it now it
does I don't even necessarily think he
has to be a a bodily change I think if
your brain knows you can't have a baby
it might actually you know also have a
change on your Chemistry just
speculating
but here's what I think
I think because
the pandemic has ruined our trust in big
Pharma
that people are going to ask questions
that they just wouldn't have asked
before
Mike don't make the birth control is a
depopulation
you know that nice try
but you still have to believe somebody
wants to do it it's not enough to say
that it exists
it's not enough to say that people have
options for having babies that that's
not a question of intent of the elites
it's just something that's an option
there might be intent but there's no
evidence of that
uh you can want to have sex with that
when you have babies yes but I believe
that women
let's get rid of that trolls goodbye
anymore
all right
so I think that the trust in big Pharma
is low enough that we can have an honest
conversation about birth control which I
believe cripples women
I believe they become
um
personality disadvantaged and they're
less less easy to be around
I don't know that I would say that I
will I'll make an analogy because you
love analogies to the Veris report
I'm not saying I know for sure that
birth control is ruining marriages and
relationships and lives everywhere
I'm saying that
it seems so obvious anecdotally that if
we're not making this a really high
priority
something's wrong
and it's probably because people trusted
big Pharma until recently so that's my
prediction the pandemic lack of trust in
big Pharma will start to bleed over into
birth control and I expect you'll see a
big movement of people who don't want to
be on birth control
and it's not because they don't want to
it's not because of babies
you'll be entirely because how it makes
them feel
just that's my prediction
all right uh here's the news from Russia
apparently Russia is allowing Russian
soldiers to freeze their sperm
you know so in case they die their their
wife can have their little sperm baby
but
I don't know it feels like
I'm no military expert but correct me if
I'm wrong were the Russian soldiers not
already freezing their balls off
foreign
because is that a big change
because I think you could just take a
dead Russian soldier say well he's dead
already just cut his balls off and take
him home to the wife because the balls
are frozen
right I mean they'll be frozen solid so
you could just cut off their balls throw
it in a bag
keep it frozen send it home boom cheaper
than a sperm bank
so as long as the Russian soldiers are
already freezing their balls off feels a
little unnecessary
um I'm joking I'm joking
about their balls
but if I were a Ukrainian let me tell
you what I would do with this
information
if I were a Ukrainian I would make sure
every single Russian citizen knew
that Russia didn't care about the
soldiers
they only wanted to keep their balls
we don't care about the entire Soldier
obviously we're sending him into this
meat grinder but we do care about their
balls
do you know why they care about their
balls
and do you know the government doesn't
care if they die in the meat grinder but
they do care about their bowls
because Russia does not want to have a
decreasing population
you get that
Russia knows that a decreasing
population is the end of Russia they
have to have babies right so yes they
are willing to even freeze your sperm
and send you off to die but at least you
know you can have some babies later if
you
I know the the balls don't make babies
by themselves
you may have detected
that that was a humor bit
years new all right uh so if I were the
ukrainians I would use this as a PR
because what is it that uh Russian men
care about more than anything in the
world
is it their elbows
is it their ears no it's their balls
it's their balls and vodka the two
things that Russian men care the most
about is vodka and their balls so if the
Russian government is telling them that
their balls are in jeopardy
hey I started a war you're probably
going to lose your balls
but you know it'd be good for I know
some historical reason for Russia or
something
but you're going to lose your balls
so
remember persuasion is about you know
accessing the irrational part of the
brain it's not about the logic of it
men are actually more afraid of losing
their balls than they are afraid of most
things
so you just say you know you better
freeze your sperm because you've got a
Ukraine and you're not going to have
balls when you come back
hahaha
get a Russian ball make a Rob Reiner
your your stretching
all right
how in the world did I learn only today
that Bill Cosby is a free man
how did I miss that story did you all
did anybody miss that too
do you know that he's totally free
like not even on parole
he's like free
[Laughter]
I didn't even know it until today
apparently happened a little while ago
yeah so I guess his case got overturned
by a higher court and the reason for the
overturning it wasn't terrible
like it's not Justice for sure there's
no justice happening here but the the
legal the legal reason for overturning I
actually agreed with
it's a horrible outcome
but the legal reason was a technical one
that a prosecutor had promised him he
wouldn't be brought up on charges on
this specific case he got he got uh
he got convicted of that he wouldn't be
brought up on the charges if he
testified in a civil case because the
thinking was it would be too hard to
convict him on a criminal case but at
least the victim
could get some money if he'd at least be
willing to deal with it on a civil basis
so he doesn't go to jail
so that was the deal
and Cosby accepted the deal
now it wasn't written but I guess it was
spoken at one point so they can confirm
the deal actually existed there's a tape
of it I guess and I I hate to say it but
I agree with the upper Court a Deal's a
deal
it is terrible
it's terrible I think it was written
you're right yeah it probably was
written
but the argument was that the next
prosecutor said I didn't make the I
didn't make the offer right so the next
prosecutor said oh that doesn't bind to
me but the upper core said it sure as
hell bind you it's the same job yeah it
does bind you and I agree with that I
agree with the decision I hate the fact
that he's released of course but
tough choices tough choices and he's
actually considering he's considering
going back on the stand-up comedy tour
how in the world is that going to work
out for him
how in the world is that going to work
out
um
so Rasmussen had a poll about uh Trump's
taxes and asked how many people would
like to see your uh Congress when
Republicans have some control in the
house how would they like to see some
Revenge
and to see the other congress people's
uh whoever voted to see his tax returns
maybe we should see their tax returns 54
percent say yeah let's see let's see his
accusers tax returns
uh
what do you think
well I have two feelings about that
first feeling is
why do we think that modifying the
Republic
to make Revenge
like Revenge a main element of the
Republic why do we think that's a good
idea
that's like the worst idea ever
on the other hand
do can you allow can you allow your side
to get pushed without pushing back
well I don't like the word Revenge I do
like I do like mutually assured
destruction
mutually assured destruction totally
works for me I don't like Revenge
you know as soon as you allow yourself
that you can have a revenge-based system
then you're off the rails right as soon
as revenge is even a word that you allow
into the conversation
I don't want any part of that system I
don't want to get revenge on anybody I
don't want it to get revenge on me no
Revenge but mutually assured destruction
can be very productive you know if you
do this to us we guarantee it's going to
happen back
so on that basis
I approve of looking at the tax returns
of anybody who has to look at his I do
think that that that's a a guard rail or
a you know or let's say a risk that
should be introduced into the system
because I don't think it's unreasonable
to ask to see somebody's tax returns
under certain situations
yeah it has to be the right situation
but there should be a cost to it it
can't be free
so let's put a price on it and then see
if they want to pay it so I'm I'm all in
favor of opening up the tax returns of
anybody who wanted to see his
especially since there's no specific
accusation right if there were some
specific accusation
I would say okay the other people don't
have any specific accusations so we're
not going to go just fishing around in
their taxes just to see if there's a
problem but that's exactly what they're
doing to Trump
they're just going to fish around
so that has to be equal
that has to work both ways because then
you have a healthier risk reward profile
in your your government and then maybe
the Republican actually work but Revenge
now got to get rid of Revenge
all right
um
did you see a fake news that uh the
White House Covenant advisor or Dr Zha
jha uh according to the fake video that
you'll see on video
he admitted on a recent zoom call that
quote no study in the world that shows
that masks work
number one did he say that
yes he did that's an exact quote
does that blow your mind
is a fake quote but it's also real do
you know how they get a real quote
that's also fake they rupart yeah the
rupar is you take it's a real quote but
it's incomplete because they take the
context down do you know what the end of
the sentence was
the end of his sentence was very well in
other words there's no study in the
world that shows that masks work very
well
the whole context is missing
I'm guessing the context was
um do you need vaccinations
if you're wearing masks why do you need
vaccinations
I don't know if that's the context but
it would make sense well if you were
answering that question you would say
there's no study the same masks work
that well
so well that you don't need vaccinations
I'm not promoting vaccinations on this
is a imaginary conversation by somebody
else right so that's probably the
context but somebody took the the very
well part which would say that masks do
work
just not very well
and reversed it to say that there's no
study that says they work at all
now I'm not I'm not supporting masks I
don't want any mandates I don't know
what the studies say because I don't
believe any study about masks
but this is fake news would you all
agree
it's fake news
yeah so just know that oh speaking of Dr
Drew
um I caught a spaces
um the spaces portion of his show
and you have to you have to hear it's
one of the best
uh best podcasts about anything that
I've seen in a long time and he's having
a conversation with another uh a doctor
and the two of them are talking about
the difficulties of you know knowing
what's what's true and what isn't in the
medical field and how doctors don't
really have all the training they need
to analyze the studies and the data it's
really good and so I I retweeted it you
could find that in Dr Drew's feed or
you'll see the retweet in mine on
Twitter
highly recommended it's a good it's like
15 minutes that'll really put some
context on it for you
um
how many of you saw that uh
Andrew daint and uh Greta tunberg are
trending together today
is everybody up to date on that that
news now
I I'm hesitant
to even report the story
because Greta did something that uh to
me is unconscionable
all right
so you know I have my complaints about
Greta and climate change but what Greta
tweeted is completely unacceptable
she did body shaming
right now body shaving I think you know
I don't do
I'm totally against it there's just
nothing good about that right
now so I don't do it for people who are
overweight because I understand there's
a you know everybody's different
um I don't do it for if you're missing a
leg I'm not going to body shame you for
missing the leg
and but let me tell you the story
so the story is you know uh
what's his name Andrew Tate was trying
to mock her and trying to win some
points by saying he's had lots of cars
and he pollutes or creates a lot of CO2
and so on and then she responded with a
hashtag which uh the hashtag humorously
humorously uh accuses him of having a
male body part that's undersized
now
why is that okay
well why is the left okay with body
shaming suddenly and everybody's go
Greta that was some great body shaping
is it because it's a man you don't like
so therefore it's okay so if there's a
if there was a let's say an overweight
woman you didn't like then you could do
some body shaming is that what you're
saying
what kind of standard is that
no I hate to do it but uh I think Greta
is
foreign
in disgusting territory disgusting
disgusting
on the other hand he does have a lot of
sports cars
trying to be even-handed here on one
hand no body shaming on the other hand
he has a lot of sports cars
I don't know why anybody needs so many
I don't know why
it's just it's just a fact that you can
process
here Trump has been proven right again
uh because uh Ben is restricting travel
from China
do you remember when Trump restricted
travel from China when the pandemic was
new
and
uh and what did Biden say he said that
Trump was being racist against Asians
by temporarily saying we better halt our
immigration to make sure we can protect
ourselves and now
Biden is requiring a negative kova test
if you're coming from China
same damn thing
so
just add this to your list of things
Trump was right about that Biden would
have to copy reluctantly so Biden is now
copying Trump reluctantly
after having criticized him for the very
same thing
um speaking of trump so Trump was
subpoenaed by that January 6th hoax
committee and they withdrew withdrew
because I guess uh harmeet Dylan
um
went after them effectively I think this
is the reason so I think our meat went
after them on separation of powers you
know that the President should be
separate and not beholden to the
Congress so if Congress can subpoena the
president is a pretty good argument and
apparently it is succeeded if the if
Congress could basically slap the
president you know outside of the realm
of impeachment which is which is
specified then it's not a true
separation of powers I have to admit
I would not have thought of that one I
guess that's why I'm not a lawyer but
that was a good play
so well played or meets nicely done
um Trump has a said some things about
abortion and Social Security and
Breitbart interview
so uh the first thing that Trump says is
that there are two traps the Republicans
fall into
one is being open to
adjusting Social Security would Trump
quite accurately
quite correctly says no that's a
contract
that's a contract with the people who
paid Social Security you can't violate
the contract now how much do you love
the fact that Trump says that
right now he's being political when he
says it but his reason is you don't you
don't go back on a deal
I love that I just love that
like I want my president to say you know
what you don't go back and deal with the
American people
even if you have a reason
even if you have a good reason you know
our budget's in trouble that's a good
reason but but just saying we're not
going to go back on a deal with the
American people that's strong
that that's that's exactly the kind of
strength I'd like to hear so that's a
good good move these other
uh is other advice to the Republicans is
about how to talk about abortion and
Trump says
um you have to have the three exceptions
in order to get elected now it's not
necessarily his personal opinion but
he's saying politically you're going to
have to say that abortion would be okay
under three exceptions
um as long as it's within the time
period I guess
um of what is it rape incest
what's the third one
rape incest and oh yeah the the health
of the mother the life of the mother
if it's to save the mother's life now
I'm not giving you an opinion when one
way or another because my opinion on
abortion is it
the consensus of women should be leading
that not the opinion of a man
so don't don't imagine you're hearing my
opinion about abortion I'm I'm
completely recusing myself and I'm going
with going with the female preference I
think that's just a better way to
organize Society
uh and now the question you ask is is
there anything like that the other way
is there anything where you say hey
women should just stay out of this
question yes
circumcision
stay out of it let the men figure it out
and we'll let you do your thing you know
let us do our thing now it's not that
you can't have an opinion but I don't
want to listen to it I just wouldn't
want to listen to it
all right uh what do you think do you
think that Trump's political instincts
let's see if we can keep it to the
political forget about whether you like
the three exceptions
is he right politically
because I think he is
yeah now
when I listened you know that one of the
things you forget about Trump
because you know he creates so much
activity and makes your brain catch on
fire and stuff one of the things you
forget about him is how Savvy he is
he's just smarter
about politics
now he you know he has his excesses and
he says some things that get him in
trouble and you know everybody can have
their own
opinions about that
but in in just a pure political
calculation should you say this or
should you say that he's really good at
this and you forget how good he is until
you're reminded by this this is exactly
right politically again not not in terms
of policy necessarily
um
as a woman you think men should be part
of the abortion conversation
fine and and if those men that you talk
about it influence you that's fine too
uh I only make I only make the decision
for myself
was that clear I'm not recommending that
other men stay out of it
I guess I should have clarified that I'm
saying I should stay out because I'm a
man a very personal feeling
I I don't I don't imply that you should
feel the same way that's just my
personal feeling
all right
half of all fetuses are male
yeah you know I mean I understand the
argument
I'm just saying that Society is better
if you let the people with the most skin
in the game
have the larger part of the decision
just in general
all right
um
Scott you did recommend men's stay
annivers for political reasons yes
yes
I still recommend that
was that is that conflicting with
anything I said
men can do anything they want I I put no
restrictions on men but
if the men talk about it they're hurting
themselves politically
but they can do it and I think if they
think the issue is important and they're
willing to take a hit to their political
Futures absolutely that would be a
completely rational decision oh yeah
it'll hurt me politically but I have to
say what I have to say
perfectly respectable I have I have full
respect for that
point of view it's just not mine
where would someone take an IQ test well
the men's organization offers them
because you have to pass some kind of IQ
test to be in the organization
so that's where I took one and you need
to be I wouldn't take an online IQ test
foreign
yeah well that's true somebody on locals
that says if you're already a local
subscriber you've already passed the IQ
test I endorse that yeah if you're
already a local subscriber
even if you weren't a genius before you
probably are pretty close now
um
your IQ is over 140 is that good yeah
that's that's pretty close to the Mensa
um
thing so the thing you should know about
IQ tests is that they're not uh one is
not equivalent to the other so if you
scored a 135 on one IQ test it could
actually be a better score than a 140 on
a different test because they're not
exactly comparable like that so
uh being in the top let's say one
percent would be a different number on
two different tests
yeah if you got your if you were tested
in the in grade school your IQ can
actually change quite a bit did you know
that
that your uh measurable IQ can go up
um if you're doing all the right stuff
so if you've developed your brain and
all the good ways that people develop
their brains your IQ would be higher
than it was when you were a kid and and
functionally it would be a liar because
if you have a talent stack and you've
exposed yourself to the right kinds of
skills that work well together so you
can see the whole field
yeah you you would have so that's why I
say about the talent stack the talent
stack is when you organize your skills
that really fit together
so you're not just somebody who knows
about climate change you're somebody
who's also a good public speaker
suddenly you're twice as useful you know
about the topic but you could also teach
it twice as good so if you're putting
together you know different skills that
fit together well especially the ones
that give you let's say insight into the
other fields
then you're functionally a smarter
you're you're you're your useful IQ for
all practical purposes could be up you
know 20 or 50 percent so anybody says
you can't get smarter it's totally wrong
you can totally get smarter
you just have to do the obvious things
that would make you that way
somebody says the right queue is 420.
well I'll tell you my IQ is 420
at least part of every day
part of every day by IQ is 420.
which is interesting because I do feel
smarter for the first 10 minutes
um
yeah you should feel smarter now than
you were than you were in high school I
would think so
all right that ladies and gentlemen is
the conclusion of my prepared notes I'm
going to go talk to the locals people
privately and thanks for joining YouTube
um
I'll talk to you tomorrow
you think my IQ dropped 10 points with
the Jabs
Maybe
