how about
that does that
work
anybody let's get some comments
boom yes uh so let me let me tell you
what happened to my
morning all right so it turns out that
sound problem is no doubt related to the
first story I was going to tell
you so every morning the first part of
my
day I fill this gigantic mug with coffee
and then I walk into my darkened
office and I look for the the little uh
Hot Plate I put it on you see the little
hot plate back
here and then I set it on the hot plate
and then then I usually turn on the
lights now the hot plate is black in a
darkened
room on a dark
desk so I just sort of feel for it and
you know put the coffee on
it I uh neglected to turn off the hot
plate from yesterday when I used
it which caused some burning of my
fingers and some Tipp of the
coffee cuz as I burned my left hand
while I was putting the coffee onto the
right hand it kind of spilled a little
have you ever had that situation where
you spill a little of something and then
you try to quickly correct
it and that works out great doesn't it
you quickly correct it no no now what
happens is you're flailing to correct it
results in slightly more
spillage how much slightly more spillage
100% of the coffee in this cup it's
quite a lot of
coffee ended up being sprayed across
every object on my desk from apparently
the sound mixer which didn't work to my
keyboard completely the entire top of
the keyboard was Liquid to all of the
electronics uh the lamp every
cord uh my my desk thing and a lot of my
notes covered with coffee
so the first part of my day
was cleaning up the biggest coffee spitt
I've ever seen in my life I mean it
looked like the Exon Val just on my
office it was all over the floor it was
all over my computer it was all over
everything there was nothing that didn't
have coffee on it when I was
done now keep in mind that this is 4 in
the morning and I haven't had coffee
yet do you know how
unpleasant it is to clean coffee from
every crevice of everything you own and
not have any coffee in you it's the
worst but the good news is the good news
is that I cleaned everything up got it
all under control except evidently I've
burned out my mixer I don't know why
that's not
working um
but here's the good news I went and I
got a brand new fresh cup of
coffee and while it was filling up in my
coffee machine I was watching looking at
my
phone and uh I probably looked at my
phone too long because it filled up you
ever have a coffee that feels like right
up to the top and then you say to
yourself oh what am I going to do
now can I could like stand here and try
to sip it off the
top and then that always Burns you cuz
it's too hot and you like you don't want
to stand there until it cools off but
you can't sip it off the
top and my coffee maker creates this
like cremma stuff you know it adds air
to it so that it's like just really
tastes good so if you suck off the top
then you just get the bad black coffee
in the bottle so I don't want to do
that so I did what any of you would do
in this situation I said to
myself yes the coffee is so close to the
top of my cup that almost any motion
will spill it and the last thing I want
to do is Spill some coffee that's for
damn sure because I just spent 45
minutes cleaning it up there's no way
I'm going to spill it but you know
what I have the skill in the stamina I
have the balance in the training to
carry this cup of coffee without any
spillage whatsoever watch me do it and
so well the long story
short after I finished cleaning off my
stairway yeah I got every
stair every stair top to bottom full of
coffee but the good news
is there's no coffee on my desk there's
no coffee on my stairs and there is
coffee in my stomach
yes yeah it was a little bit of a
prisoner Island situation but God damn
it I'm
back I I I just I'm just going to fight
through this day no matter what it takes
I I will not be
beaten by coffee all right let's get to
the news the important stuff there are
three things that I've been wanting to
try one is this Dr huberman idea of
getting sun in the morning it resets
your circadian rhythms or whatever so I
tried that yesterday I've tried it
before but I tried it yesterday in
particular I also tried grounding that
idea that if you stand on the ground
outdoors and your bare feet it'll
somehow I know change your electrical
situation so I did that yesterday but I
also tried for the first time I've had
it for years but I I infrared
SAA so I did those three things got saw
in the morning grounded with my bare
feet and took a infrared
SAA how did I feel for the rest of the
day
really really
good really really good yeah uh I had a
I just felt good all day my the infrared
sauna did in fact make my you know
muscles uh less painful yeah it was
really good so I don't know which of
those three things made any difference
I'm a little suspicious of the grounding
I'm not sure that's real the grounding
part doesn't sound real frankly but I
was trying it so those three things
really did make me feel good all right
Epstein 150 names will be
released um but three will remain
sealed which of those names do you care
about the 150 that they're going to show
us or the three they
won't of course there's nothing you can
do with the epen story that doesn't make
it worse am I right there's nothing
there's nothing you can do without story
that won't turn it into a worse version
of what it already is which is terrible
nothing yep thanks for the 150
names uh now I'm really curious about
the three you're not going to give us
all
right also uh Dr Andrew hubman says
there's some study that says it's called
the cathedral effect that if you try to
do work in a low sealing environment you
can do more detailed analytical stuff
but if you're in a cathedral or just a
high ceiling place it makes you more
creative and uh you can you know do more
creative work now this is a subset of
one of my reframes that you will see in
my amazing book reframe your brain that
everybody's talking about actually a lot
of people are talking about it and one
of the reframes is this it's for
writer's
block
that you don't have writer's block the
reframe is you're in the wrong
place because what I what I learned is
if I can't create anything where I am
it's probably because where I am it's
the position I'm sitting it's the light
in the room it's the physical
environment it's the sound or emotion
that's around me and I have to change
those things if you sit in a room by
yourself and you say oh oh I want to
write something I need to create
something but I can't do it I've got
writers block you probably don't you're
probably in the wrong place just move
your
place I discovered and I talk about it
too much that if I go to Starbucks
there's something about the noise of
Starbucks and the way they design the
the building which also has high
ceilings by the way if you go in
Starbucks High ceilings I mean higher
than your house
usually and I can work like crazy even
with the noise and the bustle and the
bad tables and the sticky tables I mean
I'm literally my elbows on the table and
it's just like full of sticky coffee and
 and people are talking on the phone
everything that shouldn't
work works
perfectly so you really can't guess what
is a good place to work you really can't
you just have toest
it Stormy Daniels uh said some funny
things about Hunter Biden and it's the
most honest take I've ever heard on
Hunter Biden so storby Daniels for the
win would you like to hear the most
honest thing anybody ever said about
Hunter Biden stormmy says Hunter seems
like he'd be fun to party
with
check yeah I would love to party with
Hunter I mean he's he's uh apparently
cleaned up his act so he's not partying
but he would have been fun
uh and then then stormmy goes on she
goes everybody's like oh my God he
didn't pay his taxes he used uh his
money on hookers and blow I'm like like
you wouldn't do the exact same thing if
you thought you could get away with
it you wouldn't spend you wouldn't spend
someone else's money on on uh on hookers
and blow if you could if you could get
away with it no I wouldn't I wouldn't do
that no
no no I mean you would I know all of you
would but I wouldn't do that
God well Harvard continues its
destruction of its
reputation apparently now um there are
reports of 40 separate acts of
plagiarism by their president Claudine
gay and even the New York Times has
published a a hitpiece onor basically
imagine the New York Times basically
just trash her at this point um yeah so
that're they're saying her plagiarism is
like a genuine
problem so what do what do you think do
you think Harvard will be forced to get
rid of her
nah no I don't think so nope and I guess
Saturday Night Live uh compared Claudine
gay to
urel
so even Saturday that live is going
after that's that's pretty brutal all
right New
Zealand according to the end wokeness
account onx uh they're they're going to
end funding for all sporting bodies that
don't crack down on trans players
competing against
women now what's interesting is didn't
you think New Zealand was kind of a
super
woke but apparently they've turned
completely on the question of trans and
sports and they're going to defund you
if you're if you're going to
have transitioning players playing on
the women's team so anyway that's
happening do you think that there's a
genuine shift in the whole wokeness
business or or are we getting
a
um now the the mug
is can you do be favor on YouTube
the the microphone is unplugged because
I spilled coffee on my mixer and it
doesn't work which I didn't realize
until I turned it on so please tell the
other people to stop asking me to plug
in my microphone could you do that just
stop just ask them to stop saying yeah
so the rest of you could you answer that
question for me so I don't have to see
it because otherwise I'm going to have
to cover up the
comments I'll just put some tape over it
so I can't see it because I can't really
do the shell if everybody's talking
about the
sound everybody CU I'm going to turn it
off in a
minute all
right all right I think you're under
control now all
right there is a
uh so the Wall Street Journal is say
that young people are increasingly get
their news from Tik Tok and it's causing
a problem because that young people are
getting a wrong opinion about
Israel Hamas
War so here's what the war used to be
Tick Tock versus
Scott I wasn't doing so well I was not
waiting
that and now it looks like it's tick
tock versus
Israel how do you think that's going to
go Tick Tock so Tik Tock is a honestly
it's an ex Potential Threat to Israel I
don't think that's too far is it is that
too far I don't think that's hyperbole I
think that Tik Tock is an existential
threat to the existence of Israel
because what it's done is it seems to
have propagandized young people to be
anti-israel and those young people I
hate to tell you but they're going to
get older and they're going to be in
charge so they basically just
Brainwashed the generation to abandon
the support of Israel now now the
question of how much United States
should support Israel is a separate
question I'm just telling you what's
going to happen right so it's not
whether they should or they shouldn't
I'm just telling you what's going to
happen what's going to happen is if Tik
Tock continues unabated if no changes
are made Israel will go out of business
I don't see how they can survive because
they if you take out the American
support you know they're going to take
out every other countes support at the
same time so it looks like
uh the battle is now between Israel's
very existence and Tik Tock still
operating at least in
America do you think that Israel could
win
that this will be a real good test
because we worry that uh China and Tik
Tok in general is having too much
influence on our
Congress but separately there are lots
of people people say hey Israel is
having too much influence on our
government now I would say of course
both China and Israel are trying to
influence our government because we try
to influence everybody else everybody's
trying to influence everybody that's
normal but now the fight is between
really two very powerful Rivals well
they're not Rivals it's just one is
doing something is bad for the other um
well who do you think is more powerful
China's influen over Congress or
Israel's influence over Congress and if
they had to fight it out over the
existence of Tik Tock who would wi China
or
Israel I'm seeing mostly
China what do you think close call I
actually don't know this this could be a
close one because the Chinese money is
apparently changing something but Israel
has has a big effect as well so if this
gets reframed as an existential threat
to Israel there's a much better chance
it gets spanned because the US is trying
to support Israel but it wouldn't make
any sense to try to support Israel at
the same time we're allowing Tick Tock
to destroy Israel so I think Congress
has to make a decision are we for
Israel are we on Israel's
side because that doesn't make sense if
Tik Tock is still
operating that makes no no sense if
you're going to be on Israel's
side why not actually do it like money
money helps but I would say that giving
Israel money certainly they like it and
it
helps but all bet they could have done
almost everything they need without our
money but you know what they can't do
they can't
survive while Tik Tock is still
operating in America they cannot survive
in the long run so you better get that
fixed and I'm on Israel's side on that
completely um there's a new research
that says doing your own research online
makes you
dumber has anybody ever told me that
before let's add this to the pile of you
know you could have just asked
Scott right if you just asked me I would
have told you how do people do
research oh I just read a story that
said Bigfoot is going to be elected to
congress I better research it so you go
down your little rabbit hole and you
find you know you search for is Bigfoot
going to run for Congress and then what
comes up a whole bunch of articles about
Bigfoot running for congress you're like
yep yep absolutely I knew it there is
the proof Bigfoot's running for congress
Yeah the more you search on your own the
Dumber you
get and now there's a study that backs
it up
except you know what the problem is
studies are fake
too why would you believe this
study why would you believe any study
it's 20 20 almost 2024 why would you
believe a
study it's it this study is like every
other study it's a coin flip it's
literally a 50% chance of being
true
50% and since it was either true or
false there were only two conditions
right either this doing your own
research either helped you or it didn't
help
you
50/50 you don't know anything just
because there's a study that says it
went one way it literally tells you
nothing does everybody get that there
are only two possibilities like a coin
flip but studies in General Studies in
general half of them don't hold up in
the long
run so if a new study comes out in this
category of things which often turn out
not to be true there's just one
study it actually tells you nothing like
actually literally
nothing because you don't know which 50%
it's in the 50% fake ones or the 50%
real ones and you could have guessed
without even having to study if you had
flipped a coin or guessed same odds
would being right it didn't didn't that
anything which is weird when you think
about it all right but I do believe it's
true that people convince themselves
that their conspiracy theories are real
by finding other people who say the same
thing that seems
obvious um so it turns out that poverty
is way down instead of
up wouldn't you think Scott I know there
are some things you can't measure I know
some sometimes the polls are not
accurate sometimes you can't predict
things way into the future but there's
one thing that should be pretty easy to
measure poverty cuz you know they do it
every year so they should have the
methodology down pretty well you know
what they were doing
wrong this is going to blow your whole
 head off here's how they were
calculating poverty
wrong you're not even going to believe
this they tried to measure how much
money you were
getting now your your common sense says
well that's what poverty is how much
money I receive
right that's pretty obvious my poverty
level is based on how much money I get
so so a smart group decided to revise it
and say what if we look at how much you
consume do you see what's happening when
they looked at how much people
consumed people were consuming a level
of uh stuff that was well beyond
poverty so if you looked at what they
actually spend and consume is way above
the poverty line they're not starving
and they're mostly not homeless right so
it turns out that when you measured
people's income it's now it's not just
credit cards when you met because the
poor don't even have credit cards the
but when you met when you looked at
poverty it turns out that poor people
have lots of ways to get resources and
they weren't all being
included yeah it's not much a credit
card thing credit card is more of a
middle class debt thing the the people
are so poor they don't even have a bank
we're actually doing better than we
thought because they had some way to get
money basically government services plus
whatever else they were doing might have
been crime could have been crime but
whatever they were doing they were
getting more consumption power than the
income
suggested so the most basic thing you
think you could
measure weren't even close weren't even
close all right uh but if you can't
measure doing your own research and be
be confident about it and you can't
really measure poverty levels at least
we can measure and predict climate
change 100 years in advance now how
lucky are we about that huh all these
other things are hard to measure but it
looks like we're really good at
measuring uh climate change and as you
know
the climate will continue getting warmer
and warmer and there's no way around
it my next story is about these cold
snap in China so
China uh let's see China is uh set a new
record in the Mongolian part of China uh
in a town called uh
ho yeah the town of
hoot was was super
cold now I don't know if there's a town
called ho cold that was also super warm
which would feel right but the town of
hoot um where all the prostitutes were
warmer than they should have been
ho um yeah new cold
record
ironically and what do the climate
change people say when record for cold
or being set in
China well here's what I say here's what
I say who cares about
China well China is like the size of a
postage
stamp no China is actually a pretty big
place if you got the whole Mongolia area
so China is setting records for cold but
here's what you didn't know climate
change doesn't just make things warmer
it makes the extremes more variable
yeah so this is just one of the extremes
caused by
warming another thing that's happening
is that the Arctic Ice you know how it
was plunging for years well several
years ago it start stopped plunging and
started increasing and it's still
increasing and it's sort of back to
where almost where it
was so it turns out that none of the
predictions have been right so far at
least about ice and you know water
levels and general warming and well
nothing really
nothing so uh yeah it's all that global
warming that's causing the the lowest
lowest temperatures we've
seen all
right uh let's talk about the
hoax situation for 2024 as you know we
we have uh we meaning the people who
study politics
have been able to do uh let's say what
would you call it uh almost anthropology
or it's almost like a a dig where we
piece together the Democrat structure of
power now that includes all the extended
Parts like the you know you've got the
ADL that you'd say well the ADL has
nothing to do with the Democrats they're
just trying to protect you know Jewish
people from various abuses but it turns
out that there's like a Democrat who's
the head of IT who uses it also besides
doing the good work to protect Jewish
people also just as a hammer to you know
hammer on anybody Republican so there's
a whole bunch of illegitimate fact
Checkers illegitimate Watch Dogs
illegitimate misinformation people and
they have all been mapped and you can
see that basically Democrat operatives
or their their buddies are the ones
running these fake organizations which
do a combination of real work because in
case they say hey look at our real work
it's real it's real work but it's not
really the big purpose the real purpose
is for the fake stuff where they can
just say Republicans are lying and
everything you said is fake right
so here's here's my take on what we know
so far we were expecting for example
that they would be some tent pole
hoaxes now a tent pole if you think of a
circus tent
the the T pole is like the the big pole
that holds up the tent so there'll be
lots of minor hoaxes and we all knew
that but months ago incl many people
including me said oh what will be the
2024 hoax against Trump and now we
know so here's here's what it looks like
first of all have you all noticed that
Biden and his supporters have stopped
talking about policies
like our policy is better than whatever
Trump would do or whatever the
Republicans would do because at this
point am I right that the policies of
the Republicans with the exception of
Haley Republicans kind of have similar
policies right V is going to get us
something that looks like Trump but his
own his own take on it right yeah so
it's basically Republican policies which
are very clear and very much in contrast
to current policy immigration being an
obvious one now wouldn't you expect that
given that the Republicans are polling
well you know collectively and they've
got uh different different policies that
are really different don't you think
that all the conversation should be
about those differences and policies
well it turns out that the uh the
Democrats have learned through polling
that all of their policies are unpopular
except
one what's their popular policy I mean
the one that's in the top group it's
abortion but abortion has been cleverly
moved into a state problem which by the
way the more I think about it I thought
it was a gigantic Mistake by Republicans
to make a deal of abortion and
essentially make themselves
unelectable but I think in the long run
it allowed them to win Federal elections
by taking it away from the Federal
decision making
process so I think like a a trump or
vake can say all right here's my opinion
on abortion but remember I don't make
any decisions on abortion if I'm
president that's totally not my job and
I'm going to I'm going to let the people
whose job it is to make that decision
citizens and the governments of the
states so at the point at this point see
if you notice that Biden and his proxies
have gone completely personal
attack complete personal attack mostly
against Trump of course so here's the uh
what I call the uh thre legged stool of
hoaxes that we can see now will be the
the primary tent pole hoaxes for 2024
number
one Trump quote invokes
Hitler he invokes Hitler with his
polluting the blood comments Etc so this
is just the fine people hoax too the
fine people hoax was that you know the
hoax that he praised neo-nazis in
Charlesville when indeed it was just a
deceptive addit and he condemned the
Nazis so they just changed it to the
opposite of what he actually did well
they're doing that here uh by if you
remove the
context it just looks like he took
something out of M comp which he never
read he says
and uh it's easy to make it look like oh
it's Hitler that's how Hitler talks cuz
nobody knows the difference number two
he's still colluding with Putin and he's
Putin's puppet so this is just Russia
collusion to so we've got fine people
hoax to he's H Russia collusion to uh
he's Putin Putin's
buddy and then we have January 6 hoax
he's an
insurrectionist so he's Hitler Putin
puppet
insurrectionist what do all of those
have in common
they're not even close to reality and
they have nothing to do with his
policies yeah at what point would the
country
notice that the the Democrats have given
up on policy they've just given up it's
it's total character
assassination period now it
works because it turns out that like
half of the country believes that the
Colorado decision keeping off him off
the ballot was the right one because
he's such a damn
insurrectionist it's actually
working
anyway those T pole hoaxes are of course
the justification for the weaponization
of the government now is this Scott and
other people being all uh snowflakey and
worrying about the weaponization of the
government or is the government simply
doing its job to to find wrongdoing and
punishing
well we do know that after
2016 and Mike Benz has been great at uh
uncovering this and explaining it that
the uh the Democrats literally said we
can't have this happen again which is
meaning Trump getting elected and they
created a whole structure to make sure
it didn't and then Soros in the meantime
was getting his his uh Lefty prosecutors
in
place and so they' created a structure
where they could lie about Trump the
fact Checkers would would back up the
the fake you know ADLs and you know the
the various other fake um organizations
would back them so they would have this
is what the Democrats like to do they
like to create fake external companies
or
entities which which tell them the right
so that their fake news can say well
Democrats make this claim and then these
fact agree with them so now it's okay
for us the news to say it's true when
it's not so basically you have the news
the the fake it's a big constellation of
entities it's maybe hundreds of these
fake entities that have been created in
the last several
years so now you've got enough judges
that are Lefty leaning who will do
literally anything like the Colorado
judges and so the weaponization of
government
depends very much on selling the three
hoaxes that
weaponization normally nobody would want
would you agree if you just ask people
without any context just stop somebody
in the screet and say do you think the
government should be weaponized against
individuals it wouldn't matter if you're
a Democrat or Republican you'd say what
did you ask me of course
not I don't want the government
weaponized against the public that'd be
the worst thing I ever heard
but suppose I came up to you and said
Hitler is taking power the only way to
get rid of him is to well sort of
stretch our interpretation of what's the
law just sort of sort of Bend our ideas
about what the Constitution is saying
and not saying but are you okay with
that because if we just yeah we just
bend it a little bit just just warp it a
little bit we can keep Hitler out of
office
office now what do the people on the
street say whoa I would normally be
totally against this weaponization of
government but now that you've convinced
me that he's Hitler he's friends with
Putin and he was an insurrectionist well
in this one case huh in this one case I
guess I'm in favor of a little bit of
weaponization because it's so
important so it's a pretty good play the
the the entire package is is pretty
tight
so they've got the the fake persuasion
the three hoaxes that's enough to
convince you that weaponization of the
government normally would be bad but in
this special case it might be the only
thing to save the planet not to mention
all that climate change is going to kill
you if you don't get the right
president they
say all right so that's what the hes
that will dominate the uh coming year um
there will be new ones but those will
probably be the big ones
um Ted Lou Congress person Ted Lou says
this about the Colorado trial he said
the Colorado trial court and then this
next part is in all caps held a trial
and made Rock Solid findings a fact that
Trump engaged in Insurrection Supreme
Court would not have any basis to
overrule the
findings the only ways Supreme Court can
overturn is to make the per the perverse
ruling that presidents can engage in an
Insurrection well Ted Lou dropping the
hammer on things huh am I right now
remember the most important thing you
need to know to understand the news is
the
Players there are some players who are
so insanely political that nothing that
comes out of their mouth should be taken
seriously
Ted Lou is one of those I like Ted Lou
I've interacted with him on X a few
times he he's sort of a happy warrior
you know but when he gets into the
political situation and anything about
Trump he goes just completely batshit
crazy here's the things that didn't
happen so he says the Colorado trial
court held the trial no they
didn't where where was where was Trump
giving his evidence that there was no
Insurrection the judges just sat there
and said well it was obviously an
Insurrection so it was nothing like a
trial uh and they made Rock Solid
findings of fact that he engaged in in
Insurrection that didn't happen there
was no fact trial on Insurrection he's
just making all of this up uh and that
the Supreme Court would have no basis to
overrule well the smartest people are
pretty sure that it could be close to a
unanimous decision which the Supreme
Court almost never does in overturning
it does he really believe any of this do
you think that Ted Lou believes one word
that he
wrote I don't know I actually don't know
it doesn't look like he believed it but
maybe I don't know yeah I mean to
believe this you'd have to be really
 stupid I mean this this take
this is like that
iq20 I mean this is so
stupid so I'm going to give him I'll
give him the uh benefit of a doubt that
he knows what he's doing because the
other alternative is kind of insulting
and I kind of like him T's kind of
cool kind of bias but kind of cool would
you like a zombie
update got a big zombie problem as uh
Sean Ono lenon posted he said uh today
at this point if you get a get the bulk
of your news from cable you're
officially a
zombie
now if you get your news by watching
both the left leaning and right leaning
cable you're at least triangulating on
something you know maybe you got a
little better idea what the fake news is
but yes if you're only watching your
preferred network you have no
idea what's going on you would have no
idea what's going on I mean you would
really be
lost um you want some more proof of
zombies uh there's an online survey
found that 54% of uh respondents uh
approve of the decision of
Colorado how in the world could you be
well informed and think the Colorado
decision made any
sense
how how can you do
that
well um here are some of the things we
know about
Biden uh he actually said this in public
now this was a while ago after he he
said that we just have to demonstrate
talking about Trump this is Biden
talking about Trump he said we just have
to demonstrate that he will not take
power what we have to demonstrate that
he will not take
power does that sound the same as we
need to run an election and win we have
to demonstrate that he will not take
power then it goes on if he does run so
this is before Trump ran making sure
under quote legitimate efforts of the
Constitution uh does not become the next
president so he says we're going to
demonstrate that he will not take power
and they going use the legitimate
efforts under the Constitution that's
called the
law so he's literally saying we're going
to use the law to keep a man of
office what he doesn't say is that he's
guilty and they said they'll use any
anything they can use in the law to keep
him out of
office isn't he saying isn't he saying
very clearly we're going to weaponize to
the justice department that's what it
looks like to me to me it looks kind of
clear that he's he's going to try to do
it within the law but within the
law if it's your own people and your own
judges the law becomes whatever you want
it to be so let me ask you this is this
Colorado decision within the
law well if the Supreme Court didn't
want to overturn it it would be yeah so
the trick the trick here is make the law
anything they want because their judges
can just Define it any way they want so
that's pretty scary but um at least he
hasn't done anything like this right it
would be terrible if he said something
that sounded a lot like we're going to
use law fair to take out our competitor
cuz we can't beat him in an election but
do we see any signs of that actually
happening well here's Glennon Greenwald
explaining the situation he says Trump's
first indictment was from a Manhattan
prosecutor his other state cases from
the Democratic Democrat Party Machine in
Atlanta his two Federal cases are under
the Biden Department of Justice and now
a Colorado Court full of Dems just baned
in from the
ballot one two 3 see
91 91
charges and this Colorado
thing and every bit of it is funded by
and done by by
democrats that doesn't look like any
kind of justice system does it wouldn't
you think that at least some of this
would be Republican driven if there was
anything
there yeah this looks exactly like Biden
said what he was going to do and now
he's executing it right in front of us
now how many of how many casual viewers
of news would be aware that Biden said
he was going to do this used you know
the legal system to the extreme and that
all of these these cases are
cases that are just treding to slow down
Trump how many Democrats actually know
that how many of them know that
Democrats created an entire structure of
fake entities to support their own fake
news if you did a survey do you think
any Democrat would know that I doubt it
there aren't there aren't even that many
Republicans who could explain it but the
people you know really pay attention
know
it there have been some death threats to
those Colorado judges according to NBC
news now let me say as clearly as
possible I do
not support any death threats against
justices or any violence whatsoever I do
not encourage
that
however however I also live in the real
world
and here's the question I ask
myself uh so if those justices made that
ruling and got a bunch of death
threats what have they learned about
cause and
effect again do not make death threats
against justices or any political people
or anybody really um and don't do any
violence against anybody don't do that
but do you think the justice has learned
that if they try to the country
right front of the country that at least
half of the country will nous and
they're not going to like
it I have a real mixed feeling about
this but I but I feel like I'm turning
evil you know like Biden because the
Democrats were saying you know normally
we wouldn't do evil things but stopping
Trump is too important so we're going to
do a little evil to stop him and then I
feel myself looking at this and say oh
these uh Colorado judges who tried to do
an Insurrection and take uh the
preferred candidate of about half the
country off of the election and for
basically the the dumbest ridiculous
thinnest legal excuse you've ever seen
looks like some of the worst things I've
ever seen done in the history of the
United
States and then Patriots of the United
States said you know what we're going to
 kill
you honestly emotionally I don't have a
single problem with
it but legally and morally and ethically
do not do this
 you know I I can say it doesn't
bother me because it doesn't bother me
at all honestly like you know the way I
feel it I don't feel it I don't feel the
problem but intellectually do not do it
don't get yourself in trouble don't
threaten people don't do it do not do it
but honestly didn't make me feel bad CU
cause and effect has to work all right
the entire system depends on mutually
assured
destruction if any Court in this country
did something to destroy the United
States and found themselves getting
destroyed as a result that's not a bad
outcome it's not nothing you'd ask for
but it's not a bad outcome you need bad
things to have bad outcomes otherwise
nothing works nothing works it's got to
be pushed back but not this
way all right
um did you know that uh as the 2020
election was coming by that there were
Democrats who were talking
about uh a military coup to get rid of
trump in
writing yeah Mike Ben talks about this
um apparently somebody named Rosa Brooks
in 2020 head of the transition Integrity
project um they were talking about plans
to get rid of trump if
he I guess if they thought he lost the
election but he didn't leave so they
they thought yeah we can get Mike Pence
to do the 25th Amendment maybe uh maybe
a military coup or just having the
military refuse to follow orders they
were actually talking about
really really illegal in writing
they're not hiding that's exactly what
it looks
like um and now Biden said this recently
Trump poses many threats to our country
now listen look listen for the part
where he says Trump's policies would not
be good CU I'm I'm sure that's here
right uh Biden says Trump poses many
threats to our country the right to
choose Civil Rights Voting Rights and
America standing in the world but the
greatest threat he poses is to our
democracy was there anything there
about his
policies anything is literally just
about yeah he's
scary orange man
bad all right um I forget if I told you
this yesterday but George cloy has this
movie
about um some American ameran athletes
competing in Nazi Germany when Hitler
was in charge so in other words it's a
movie that's going to put Hitler into
your face in a popular movie in a way
that's kind of unusual because you don't
always have a movie in which Hitler is a
main
character but George Clooney is now let
me ask you this you're aware that the
CIA is well known decades ago they used
to work with movie theaters or movie
Producers to make sure that the movies
were brainwashing Americans the way they
wanted so the movies would make you
patriotic and want to join the military
you'd want to be Rambo you know so
basically it was well understood that
the CIA was influencing Hollywood to
make movies that brainwash the public in
in ways that they thought were good for
the country I
guess I hope um but thank y that all
stopped but by total
coincidence there's a George Clooney
movie in which Hiller is featured at
exactly the same time the Democrats are
trying to make you think about
Hiller now I'm not saying the CIA
influenced George Clooney but I would
tell you if I were in the CIA and it
were my job to influence people there
are certain people I would Target get as
obvious wants to Target George Clooney
would be at the top of the list why he's
obviously a
Democrat but more importantly he's
political if you went to him and said
George you can help us save America
really how well if you make movies that
fit The Narrative of getting rid of
Trump by making Hitler more in our minds
because he's being Hitler's being
compared to Trump you want people to see
Hitler really think about him really
have a sort of a Hitler first frame in
their mind and then you know we can get
rid of trump so if you were going to
make a movie I know you've got lots of
choices but do you have anything that
would be like
hitterish oh yeah we'll put that the
front of the line now let me be very
clear I I don't want to accuse George
Clooney or something I don't have any
evidence of that I'm just saying if you
were looking for evidence that the CIA
was still manipulating things that's
exactly what it would look like it would
look like finding a political person
who's a popular celebrity George flyy
and getting that person to be associated
with content that is right on point with
your narrative and this is right on
point with the narrative does that mean
that George cloy is a CIA asset how
would I know I just know it would look
exactly like this yeah and if you're
looking for other hints that the CIA
might want to still influence
movies you would look for crazy stuff
like something that didn't make any
sense for example uh let's say I'll just
pick a crazy example let's say Netflix
gave a development deal to
Obama who had no experience in the film
industry
now have you ever seen an ex-president
go into the movie
business oh they did oh they did Netflix
did give a development deal to the
Obamas oh yeah they
did now again I'm not saying I have any
evidence that the CIA wants the Obamas
to make content that's good for the
Democrats I'm not saying that I don't
have any evidence of that I'm just
saying that if the the CIA were
influencing
Hollywood it would look exactly like
this exactly like this
so you
decide is it is it exactly what it looks
like of course it
is of course it is because when it comes
to the
government what is the
assumption is the government innocent
until proven guilty no
nope the government has to be guilty
until proven innocent if they can't give
you
transparency you should just assume
they're
guilty so I don't know if the CIA is
influencing movies I don't know I can't
prove it but I assume it it's a good
working assumption because it looks
exactly like it and you can't prove
otherwise so it's good working
assumption
all right um remember V uh embraced what
some call the great replacement idea
that the immigration is being
uncontrolled as part of the plan by the
Democrats to get more Democrat voters
because they assume that immigrants will
be more likely
Democrat um rasmason asked people How
likely is it that some people are
promoting Mass immigration to the United
States as part of a political agenda to
replace the existing American population
now the way rasmuson worded this is the
polite way to say it and appropriate way
but really the great replacement what
people talk about is replacing white
people right so there there's a slight
difference well maybe a big difference
between replacing or adding Democrat
voters versus or real real plan is to
get rid of Whitey not exactly the same
right but V take I think has more to do
with the voting right so so V is doing a
little victory dance today because
apparently polling shows that
um people largely agree with v that the
people coming into the country are part
of a plan by democrats to get more
voters so here's the thing men said it
was probably true
62% women 53
so is that consistent the men 62% said
oh yeah it's obvious you're bringing in
these other voters but women said you're
far less
53 I think this is the natural
difference between protectors and
nurturers don't you think cuz the
nurturers are like yeah it's a problem I
mean it's a problem but they're people
yeah we should treat them nice so yeah
some
it might cause some issues but still
nurturing is important you know taking
care of people whereas the men say um
did you just say that there's a risk at
the border well yes but you know I'm
sure we can handle it and the men say
We'll close the border well but you know
we could probably let them in and the
sanctuary St well we'll find a way to
and the men are like or or close the
 border it's just a male Instinct
so you can see there be a male male
female
difference but apparently every group
black white ESP spanic young and old by
a majority a majority every group
believes that immigration is for the
purpose of changing the voting balance
in the United States every group black
Hispanic White young old male and female
every group agrees with
vake every group
group have you ever seen that before
every group believes this is true every
group I don't know if I've ever seen
that can you think of anything else any
other political decision where every
group agreed by
majority what would be any
other I can't think of any other topic
this is this is the only one yeah all
right um and then Elon Musk weighed in
and he said a member of Congress told
him uh I guess in person a member of
Congress told him that it is a
deliberate means of importing future
left-wing voters now what Elon Musk
didn't say is if that member of Congress
was a Republican or a
Democrat that matters if a republican
said it it could be political talk if a
Democrat said it I'd think oh wow that's
really telling me something so I'd like
to know who that was or at least their
party um and then he says viewed through
that lens this administration's
facilitation of massive illegal
immigration precisely matches their goal
so it would certainly
explained why something as easy as
closing the Border isn't happening the
only explanation is that somebody in
charge doesn't want it to happen there's
no other
explanation so I guess
so um the also went after Nikki hilly
because Nikki hilly was
claiming that the O October 7th attack
was on October 7th because it Putin's
birthday and so Putin is connected with
the Hamas thing and therefore Putin must
be killed because he's trying to destroy
Israel as his side project I guess um
but V says this about that he saids
Nikki h is now uh psychotically claiming
that Putin's birthday is on on October
7th and that's somehow related to humas
attack on Israel but then it gets more
fun and and then if it makes sense you
can see the dollar signs flashing in her
eyes she needs to publish her tax
returns and clients uh of her and
clients of her defense contractor now
and then V ends with roll that log
over roll that log over
now that's good
persuasion because you can see the log
can you you can you just feel the log
and you can see all the the bugs and
worms coming out underneath it's so
visual I don't think V gets enough
credit for the quality of his
Communications even though even though
people not it I don't think they fully
not it you know what I mean I mean
everybody who's watching say okay we've
never really seen anybody like this
honestly I've never seen anybody with
this level of skill running for
president communication skill
understanding of topics have you now I I
think you know RFK Jr is super
skilled very persuasive very smart can
go deep on issues but I think VI's
another level I think he's even above
that and you know of course I always say
about
Trump I comparing Trump to anybody is a
waste of time because there's just one
Trump like whatever he does is it's just
his own package of persuasion you just
can't compare that to anything but of
the people who are not Trump in the
world I've never seen anything like the
V never seen anything like it it it's a
whole other level and if nothing else
happened we would at least remember that
we had one American who could do
that do you know how important that is
to me it's like really
important because if you see the the
bumbling idiots that usually run for
office you say to yourself aren't we
supposed to be putting our best people
there like where are our best people why
why don't good people ever run for
office is it just you Crooks and idiots
and buffoons and clowns all the time and
then suddenly a vake shows up now you
could love or hate his policies that's a
separate question but you can't look at
him and say oh we're not sending our
best we definitely send our
best absolutely we send our best now and
I say good things about RFK Jr too I
think he's he's quite an addition to the
process now I like of course you know
Trump has his pluses too
but honestly when when did we ever run
anybody as qualified as
ever Jefferson Thomas Je
maybe I mean you have to you have to
work at it I mean I think AB Lincoln was
kind of a bad
guy I'm not sure a Lincoln was the good
guy that we try to remember him as but
of good guys yeah um is in a Class by
Himself I saw a post by some ex-user
called Jackin Doyle who replied to me
and said the situation in Gaza is
complex requires a careful understanding
of historical political and humanitarian
factors it's important to approach
discussions with empathy and respect for
all perspectives involved to which I
say
nah nah no how many people think the
Gaza situation is complex complicated
and
complex Hamas is the simplest situation
I've ever seen let me explain it to you
can I let me explain the entire Middle
East all the
complexity the side that has the best
military gets what they
want are you still
confused and anybody have any extra
questions there's nothing else to know
that's the whole story see the the
complicated part is the part that
doesn't
matter right so let's talk about you
know who was there 3,000 years ago and
then the dispora and then you know the
let's talk about the UN in 1948 and and
what happened then who who left and why
they left and and then you know the
Hamas and then the Palestinians but then
the Palestinians and then there's some
abuse of the Palestinians but then
they're terrorist so you have to do some
things you oh sure if you talk about all
that stuff it gets complicated but you
know what all of that stuff has in
common everything I mentioned has one
thing in common none of it matters it
doesn't the history doesn't matter
that's the stuff they're trying to tell
you to get to get you on their side but
the the Israeli military is the entire
story Israel wants a certain set of
things they have the military to make it
happen and so that's what's going to
happen what's to
discuss oh here's what I would like to
happen what good is
that what you would like to happen has
no no impact
anything how about your good ideas of
what they should do nope no impact how
about you are disgust at the terrible
things they're doing nope no
impact none of the complicated stuff
matters there is lots of complication
but none of it
matters so when people ask me what I
think about it um I've come up with a
solution for that
that I feel is the best one all I say is
that uh Israel's response to the October
7th is Justified based on only this this
is the only
justification anybody who could do what
they're doing would do it we would every
other country would too there are zero
countries that would let that
go and there shouldn't be any countries
that let that go now if you want to get
into but but but Hamas you know they had
reasons I don't care well what would the
reasons have to do with
anything because it's just it's just
cause and effect if you do that to any
country October 7th and that country has
the ability to do it back to you
harder what do you think is going to
happen our discussion of what should
happen is completely useless it is just
going to it's just cause and effect
so I have no no uh confusion
whatsoever and then if you try to take
me down the rabbit hole and you say but
Scott when you say it's Justified are
you considering the 3,000 years of
history and my answer is
no no do you know why because it doesn't
matter 3,000 years of History doesn't
matter cuz the one with the big military
will get whatever they want if Hamas had
the better military they would destroy
Israel and we would be sad but it would
happen it would happen right no doubt
about it it would happen and we could
talk about the history all day long
while it happened it wouldn't make any
difference as long as their military was
strong enough to get it
done so yeah let's let's stop imagining
there's anything complicated about the
Middle East the ones with power win
that's it that's
it uh the IDF says they confirmed
they've killed 5,000 Hamas
Fighters you might say to yourself well
that sounds like good news if you're on
Israel's side here's the bad news they
estimate there were 30,000 of them and
some of the senior leaders might have
already
escaped so they've only killed 177% of a
group they vowed to kill 100%
of they're not really very close to the
end point but I have a real question of
how how anybody knows how many people
are in tunnel still alive how do you
count the people that are in a tunnel
that
collapsed do you think it's possible
that the real number is closer to you
know 10 or
15,000 but since nobody knows who's in
the tunnel they're not
confirmed if if they already got rid of
what a third of the tunnels maybe a
third of the tunnels are blown up
something like like
that they they wouldn't have any idea
who's how many people are left now I
heard an estimate can somebody do with
fact checking this uh this would be an
estimate that came from
Hamas and uh for the
NPCs uh I'd like to give the NPCs their
prompt uh in a moment I'm going to State
a number that came from Hamas as a
source uh Hamas is an unreliable source
they should be expected to lie and
exaggerate the deaths of the civilians
now what I'd like you to do if you're an
NPC is I want you to hear that and then
go into the comments and say Scott why
are you believing
Hamas because that's the most obvious
thing to say so the NPC is getting ready
to say the most obvious
thing which is Hamas reported I think
20,000 deaths in
Gaza is did anybody hear that number I
heard it in
passing now
now have I mentioned that Hamas is not a
reliable source of that information did
I mention that no yeah it's not
reliable however have you noticed that
the news is quite happy to quote their
numbers right so as long as the news
quotes that number that will become the
real number at least sort of in the
common consciousness
now before the War Began or before the
real heavy fighting
started I said what would be the number
of people dead or claimed to be dead
that would be the the real problem for
Israel like so if you imagine for
example and this didn't happen but
imagine if Israel had going in hard into
Gaza 500 people died but they got
control of the situation and
accomplished their goals I would say to
myself five 00 wow that's a lot of
people you don't want 500 people dying
but I would also say you know what it's
kind of proportional I mean actually
it's better than proportional because
it's you know less than you could have
killed if it were 500
people and then I said all right just in
my
mind what would I feel were too many
deaths like what number would just seem
just out of
control at the beginning before anybody
was dead and I said 20,000 did did I say
that out loud I don't remember I know I
said it privately did I did say that
loud okay so we just hit that
number from this point on 20,000 is kind
of the level at which the the Holocaust
narrative that supports Israel's very
existence is very
weakened because now it's going to be
uh
transposed and compared to 20,000 people
the claim have I mentioned that hamas's
claims of casualties are not
reliable at all is anybody is anybody
have I mentioned that before yeah
they're not
reliable but it will become part of the
common Consciousness because the media
were
reported so I worry a lot about
20,000 20,000 is is a is a red flag like
there there was a heavy yellow all the
way but now you're into red flag
territory where it looks like From This
Day Forward
Forever um at least people in the Middle
East and anybody supports them on Tik
Tok is going to say that they that they
were alive when a genocide
happened am I right now I'm not saying
it's a genocide you know I'm more
nuanced than that I'm just saying that
that 20,000 number even coming from the
least reliable source
ever is a real
problem yeah 10,000 I think they could
have lived
with but if the if Hamas gets away with
keeping the 20,000 number that's pretty
big now keep in mind the Israel said it
wanted to kill 30,000 people who were
actually Warriors in Hamas so Israel's
Target number of deaths is 30,000 at a
minimum that's not count that's not
counting any
civilians so if they do what they plan
to do and got all
30,000 and then you added on top of that
the number of Civilian deaths it's like
a whole Vietnam you know I mean because
American deaths were 50,000 a
year or no 50,000 in
total wait what was
Vietnam
Vietnam was 50,000 total for the whole
War for American casualties obviously
the Vietnamese lost
Millions yeah it's over 50,000
so I I think Israel if they actually did
what they say they're going to do the
reported number whether that's close to
reality or not is going to look like
50,000 and that's a real
problem real problem all right we'll see
they handle
that uh Biden is hiring a director for
social
Communications and I saw this on a on a
post by
Alx um and uh where do you think that
they would advertise for hiring their
director of social
Communications where where would be a
good place to I guess they're
advertising that on
threads
threads
that's where they're looking for their
social media
Master yeah we're going to get our we're
going to get the best and the brightest
off with
threads all right all right I would have
looked on X if I were them but all right
that's fine anyway I I have nothing to
add to that joke because it's a joke by
itself and that ladies and
gentlemen is what I'd like to tell talk
about today sorry about the sound
problems I'll figure out what's going on
here
um but it looks like my spilled coffee
is going to be the real answer to that
question I probably pushed some button
accidentally I don't know I'll figure it
out thanks for
joining uh YouTube and thanks for
putting up in the bad sound and I will
talk to you tomorrow
