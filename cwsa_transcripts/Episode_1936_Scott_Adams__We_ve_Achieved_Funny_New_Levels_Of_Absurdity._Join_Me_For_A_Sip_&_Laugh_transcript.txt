good morning everybody and welcome to
another highlight of civilization coffee
with Scott Adams the finest experience
of your life
so far
tomorrow's looking good too now if you'd
like to take it up to levels of
happiness that we didn't even know were
possible until recently all you need is
a cup of mug or a glass attacker jealous
this time a canteen drug or flask of a
vessel of any kind and fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that don't be anything means
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens all over
the world now go
very good very good yeah
that's some good stuff
well the good news is the Dilbert
website is restored
so from Friday through Tuesday
it was pretty well hosed I I don't have
any updates myself
so I don't know what the problem was or
why it took so long
but my initial initial belief was it was
probably a bad hack
I don't know
but it's back up and is working and
that's all good
did you know that Intel
the company the company Intel has
developed a deep fake detector
apparently you can look at a deep fake
you know a digital image of a person
and they can even pick up like
apparently changes in blood flow
I I don't know how it picks that up but
it thinks it can
and so that would be awesome 96 is
pretty good I would think that the ones
that we cared about would be the ones we
can't detect but
um and then I wondered
I wonder if you could build a detector
to detect NPCs
and do you remember the Battle Star
Galactica
where part of the technology was they
could detect the uh
this Androids I guess so they could
detect the people who looked exactly
like people the the cylons yeah they
look exactly like people but they were
really young mechanical
uh
here's how I think you could build an
NPC detector
it goes like this
you just go up to somebody you want to
check
and then you say hey I heard about a
really good form of exercise
the experts are saying it's an excellent
form of exercise and it's kind of new
and uh you know it seems to hit all the
notes and all the experts say it's a
really good form of exercise
now what you do is then you wait that's
that that primes the detector what
you're waiting for
is for somebody to say
swimming is the best form of exercise
and then you got them
that's an NPC
because the NPCs will only say the most
obvious thing you could say in that
situation
right so just ask that just say oh this
is new form of exercise and just wait
swimming is the best form of exercise
gotcha I gotcha
so you try that
try that on your so-called relatives
over the holidays
find out how many your so-called
relatives if you know what I mean
are real
all right um
San Francisco is going full racist
um the city of San Francisco fired
a person who is in charge of its
elections the the elections Department
chief
whose performance was good there was no
problem whatsoever and the people who
fired him says no there's no problem
with his performance
he had one problem that they couldn't
overlook
white and male
and they said how in the world are we
ever going to have diversity at the
senior levels of responsibility if these
white people are clogging up the
progress they're keeping these jobs so
there was a white guy who was like
ruining everything by simply having a
job and doing it well according to
everybody and because he had a job and
he did it well he was
obviously sort of a racist because he
was blocking out any chance of diversity
because there were only so many jobs
so he got fired
um I would love to be the lawyer who
handles that lawsuit
because if that's not a slam dunk
I don't know anything
if you can't win that lawsuit
I I don't know anything
about anything
am I wrong
don't you just have to show up to win
that one
so why was why was he fired well he was
fired because he's a white male
and that's the end of the case isn't it
or could you get a jury in San Francisco
who said I'd like to hear more
I'd like to hear the other side of this
only in San Francisco
could the actual employer say well we do
stipulate we do admit
performance was great he was only fired
because of his uh he was a white male
and and then only in San Francisco would
somebody say I'll need to hear more
I'd like to hear you know because
probably you know there's an argument on
the other side
um
I'm not so sure no standing
all right
here is the most horrifying
humorous
story of the day
can we agree there's nothing funny about
people dying
because we're all good people right
it is not my fault
that there's a story in which this is
just horrendous like a a human tragedy
of the of the highest level
and still something came out of it that
I can't ignore
all right I didn't want to talk about
you know mass shootings but you all know
there was a lgbtq nightclub that got
shot up
I don't want to talk about those details
although except there was a I think an
army veteran who took him out took him
down so
so thank you for your service twice
there's somebody you can thank for his
service twice once for I think three
tours in Iraq and once we're taking down
the shooter and the lgbtq club
interestingly he was neither he was not
lgbtq he was just a fan
he just liked the environment he was
having a great time with his family and
you know they have some connection to
the community I guess so he's a big fan
of the LGBT community but I bet they're
pretty happy he was there because uh if
you listen to his description
I'll tell you this is the best argument
for diversity
you'll ever get
now when I say diversity I mean all the
ways people think differently act
differently have different experiences
different life truths you know like all
the whole realm of diversity do you know
why
because this military guy in that club
as he described it when the shooting
started he ran toward it
you ran toward it
how much training do you have to have to
run toward gunfire
well I don't have that
although I can't guarantee I wouldn't
run toward it because I do like danger
more than I should
um
that's amazing isn't it it's amazing so
if you didn't have one person with that
kind of let's call it diverse the person
with diverse experience and diverse
I don't know maybe even philosophy about
what to do in that situation if you
didn't have that guy there would have
been a lot more people dead
right
so there's a there's a case where
diversity of one type really made a
difference
um but here's the story which I hate to
be amused by this because you know the
larger story is a tragedy of course but
apparently the accused shooter
um is identifying as non-binary
which we cynical people suspect
may not be entirely on the up and up
because part of the uh part of the
charges would be hate crime related
because of where it was
but he the the uh they apparently we do
not speak of the alleged shooter as he
anymore that's the old way we now refer
to the shooter as they
so they
has established a non-binary identity
and I don't know what is funnier
the fact that it might work
my work
you know
and maybe he is
can we rule out the possibility that the
shooter actually does
identify as non-binary
I think that's entirely possible I don't
know that's why it might work and but
the funny part is
that the the left
has a very strong rule that you get to
identify yourself it's not for other
people to tell you what you are
so I believe he's embracing and
amplifying
if you know what I mean
he may be taking the left's own
philosophy and just saying all right if
those are my rules I'll play by your
rules how do you like it
or his lawyer is Right some combination
of him plus his lawyer so uh watching
CNN's Ellison camarado deal with this
news and not know what to say about it
because she can't be
anti-identify whatever you want
that's not going to really work with the
CNN brand even the revising in brand
uh and she can't say it's not true
because they don't have they don't have
that reporting there's nobody to say
it's not true so what are you going to
do with it you just got to say it and
then sit there with a look at your face
like oh God why do I have to be involved
in this news
uh
the shooter is a fired non-binary cook
somebody say does anybody have any any
evidence that the non-binary is indeed
was indeed non-binary before the
shooting
is there any actual evidence of that
because that would make it even
I hate to say interesting that's that's
just a horrible word
prior by two years somebody says all
right well we'll see
we'll see
uh we don't know about that
um
anyway
so of course the Democrats are accusing
Republicans of their rhetoric uh stoking
this this violence now of course
that that narrative will go away if it
turns out that this is a leftist
non-binary person
as possible
so we'll see where this goes but
um I was wondering what exactly was it
the Republicans said that would Inspire
somebody to get a firearm and go and
shoot a bunch of people
in the LGBT community
have any of you heard any Republicans
suggest
death to the lgbtqs
or anything even close to that
isn't the only thing they say
um some of you stay away from our kids
like have you ever seen a republican say
it's all those gays like all those gays
want our want to train our kids in ways
we don't like I've never heard that
I
I don't even know
I mean I don't I don't even hear
anti-gay anything from conservatives and
I would hear it believe me I would hear
it like nobody people don't hold back
when they're talking to me privately
like if if you're if you're new to my
live stream or if you're especially if
you lean left trust me when people talk
to me privately they don't hold back and
when conservatives tell me I get the
whole story and I just don't hear any
anti-gay stuff
like from anybody it just sort of
doesn't exist now I'm not saying there
isn't some place in the Deep South or
some other places where it's really a
bad problem I'm just saying it's just
one report right I'm just an anecdotal
reporter so I don't I don't mean to say
that my experience is General
but for what it's worth
I have a lot of contact with the
conservative community and they seem to
be concerned about how things would
affect their preferences
but nobody gives a where you put
your penis I've never heard that nobody
or where you put any other part of you I
guess just to make it a just to make it
uh inclusive yeah
Mike Pompeo who we think might be
gearing up to run for
president
um you said this I get asked who's the
most dangerous person in the world is it
chairman Kim is it uh Xi Jinping
he said the most dangerous person in the
world is Randy Weingarten
to the president of the biggest
teachers union
now remember this is Mike Pompeo
whose entire job was to figure out who
is the most dangerous person in the
world and Protect America from him
and he just said the most dangerous
person in America is an American who is
essentially destroying your children's
future
by doing a good job
so if I could be fair
it looks like Randy Weingarten does a
good job for her members if they don't
care about anything else
but
it doesn't work for the rest of us
all right and uh Pompeo said who's the
most likely to take this Republic down
it would be the teachers unions and the
filth that they're teaching our kids
well you know the filth part is a subset
of the larger problem I wouldn't say
that's the big risk I don't think it's
the filth that's going to take us down
that's just a preference a big one I
mean it's important but
that's not I think what takes us down is
just bad education system that fills
people's heads with you know America
hating ideas
um
all right so
I gotta say
I hear lots of critics of Mike Pompeo
and I don't know exactly what he did or
didn't do that you don't like but
if there's a republican candidate who's
going to go directly at the head of the
teachers unions
he just reached the top of my
consideration list
I gotta say
he just went right to the top now not
above Trump or above DeSantis but he's
in the mix now
until Pompeo said this I would not have
considered him
as serious anything
and if Mike Pompeo says I'll take out
the cartels labs
it's going to be tough not to support
him
it's going to be tough
so let me warn you in advance if you
have some reasons you don't want me to
support Mike Pompeo for president
maybe you should tell me before I get
ahead of myself now everything you say
about him he's a rhino he did this he
did that I'm not going to care
I'm a single issue voter If he if he
plays me right on my single issue
then you and I got to be on the other
team the opposite teams that's just the
way it's going to go
all right now uh ideally what would
happen ideally
ideally
he would make the other candidates more
competitive
so if in fact he said something
aggressive about the cartels I think
Trump and DeSantis or whoever runs
they're going to have to they're going
to take their game up to match it don't
you think
whoever says the toughest thing on the
Republican side
that becomes a competitive Point
anybody who's below that point is going
to have to come up to it I think
so having Mike Pompeo in the race or
even just talking about being in the
race so far
good work
good work
because Mike Pompeo just made the
conversation better
in my opinion so forget about whether
you support him or not he just made the
conversation better by throwing the
Randy Weingarten you know issue into the
at the top of the mix so good job he's
already added to the to the country I
think in that one sense
um I need to give you there's a
confusing story in the news today so I
need to give you a clarification some of
you may have mixed up two stories
but there's a story in the news that in
Mexico speaking of Mexico a dog was
spotted running through Mexico with a
severed human hand
in his mouth and uh so people followed
it back to where it found it and found
53 bags of human remains buried in the
ground
so that was a dog with a severed human
hand and
no you I know you're saying it's old
news no no no no the old news was that a
dog was seen carrying a separate head
because so that's the confusing part so
not long ago there was uh in uh
Zacatecas Mexico there was a dog
carrying a severed human head which was
also followed back to the mass burial
where they found you know lots of dead
bodies so don't confuse the story about
the the Mexican dog with a severed hand
that track back to a big pile of dead
bodies this that's different from the
story of the dog with the severed head
the track back to a pile of bodies now
I'm not a psychic but I'm going to make
a prediction
I feel within two weeks there's going to
be a story about a Mexican dog with a
severed foot
that will wait for it wait for it lead
back
to a mass grave of other bodies
we'll just see how I do
see how I do I just feel like that's
coming
so nothing to worry about in Mexico
there
now let me ask you this
do you think the average Mexican citizen
would object to the American Military
wiping out the cartel
cartels multiple cartels do you think
the average Mexican citizen would be
opposed to the American Military saying
look we're just going to save you
you guys need some saving so we're just
going to kill your bad guys for a while
I feel like the citizens wouldn't be
that opposed I mean there's always going
to be you know screaming
but I feel like I feel like you could
give 60 of the citizens on board just to
say well we'll wait we'll wait and see
how this turns out
let's not judge this too soon
let's see how it turns out
yeah now of course plenty of people
would be you know nationalists and
plenty of people would be benefiting
from the cartels and so you're always
going to get lots of you'll always get
lots of uh you know disagreement than
anything but I got a feeling a lot of
the public would be okay with it I mean
if you've got dogs scaring around body
parts
where you live you're going to be
looking for an alternative
all right as was noted CNN might not
have tweeted this or had this news story
um a year ago here's the actual headline
on CNN
talking about the vaccinations new
boosters add limited protection against
covid-19 illness
did you expect CNN ever to say that the
boosters don't help that much
yeah yeah now can we take a moment
to once again
give CNN a little bit of credit
right every time they do something right
I feel like I should call it out
and this looks like straight reporting
to me that's just great reporting so
good job
um
as far as that goes
so I have a theory
the Democrats vote mostly for policy and
Republicans vote mostly for personality
leadership I'd say now of course both
sides
consider all variables they both
consider the leadership they both
consider the policies but do you think
that you could ever get a Democrat I'm
sorry do you think you could get a
republican candidate
like let's say with just the general
capabilities of
Biden fetterman Adam Schiff or swalwell
I mean I feel like I feel like uh
I feel like Republicans say first we're
going to start with
are you a functioning human being you
have some leadership skills
and you say well Trump
you know lots of leadership skills uh
DeSantis lots of leadership skills you
know Abbott leadership skills and
Lindsey Grant exists
you know lots of exceptions lots of
exceptions of course but in our current
mode
don't you think that the the Democrats
can literally run anybody
am I wrong
I think the Democrats are okay
with having somebody who's just like a
seat filler or a proxy for the policies
that they like I think as long as they
get their policies
they don't really care who it is
and I feel like the Republicans are a
little bit more
maybe more tuned to strength of
leadership
you know maybe uh isn't there some
science about that that Republicans are
like strong leaders
did it I think I saw that
so it kind of makes sense it kind of
makes sense that there's a
there's no bench for the Democrats but
it might not make any difference at all
in fact I'm going to predict that the
quality of the candidate for president
probably won't be a factor
at least on the Democrat side
um
but on the Republican side if the
Republicans are not all happy with their
the leadership qualities of the
candidate that's the problem so I think
you could get Democrats to vote for
literally any individual
long as a republican Democrat but I feel
like I feel like Republicans are going
to be a little more judgy about the the
leadership capabilities of the specific
person
so that's you know a problem for Trump
have you ever seen a time when we had
fewer genuine leaders in this country
is it my imagination that leadership is
largely gone away
right
it seems like there's an enormous vacuum
and I don't mean I don't just mean that
Biden is weak that's part of the story
but it feels like nobody's strong
right because because Trump has been you
know suppressed and he's off of Twitter
and everything else even though musk is
teasing it back with funny memes which
is hilarious
um but we've never had less leadership
and I feel like some of that void is
being filled by the internet dads
you know the actual internet dad's
influence so there's definitely a shift
happening I think
um
and more to my point the two you know
some of the most provocative or
let's say uh what do I want to say
extreme I don't know candidates on the
right
so think about the people who get the
most criticism on the right
let's say Marjorie teller green
uh and bobert let's just pick two of
those characters
don't you notice that both of them are
both strong leaders
like the personality wise they're they
they just like scream leadership but you
might not like you know some things they
do you might not like some things they
said you might not like their policies
but wouldn't you agree that they're both
very strong
charismatic leaders so you can dislike
them for any number of things but you
can't you can't deny
that when they're on camera
they they project a strength
it's very Republican thing I'm not
saying it's good or bad it's just an
observation that could explain a few
things
um
all right
and the Republicans don't really have
the Republicans are really real trouble
you know right
because if you say to yourself well you
got Trump if people decide him you know
he's been presidents that's a strong
Choice and then you look at your
Republican bench and you say
Scott Scott that Republican bench looks
pretty strong
what's it going to look like after Trump
is done with them
it's going to look like you're going to
have a trump that you know a third or
more of Republicans aren't happy with
and then all of the options will be
destroyed
so we're not going to have much left to
choose from you know by the time we're
done
all right
um did you see the spokesperson for
Biden
Korean
John what's her name why can't I never
remember her name
Jean-Pierre
okay whatever
um but her answer about fentanyl coming
across the border was that the abiding
Administration has caught a record
amount of Sentinel they have inter
interdicted a record amount so that's
pretty good right they got a they got a
record amount that they captured coming
across the border
I'll tell you there's nothing that makes
me more angry
than when somebody is bullshitting you
and they don't bother to
make it look like maybe they're not
if you if you ask what are you doing
about Fentanyl and the only answer is
how much they caught at the border
and they don't tell you how much God
through
as in did more get through than ever
or is all that catching at the border
reduce the total amount that got through
or is it possible you don't know
because the only data I care about is
what got through
if you're telling me what didn't get
through you're not talking in the same
conversation oh very good I'm glad you
caught it no good job go catch some more
but has nothing to do with with you know
understanding what the problem is if if
you're if you are going to insult the
public
with that answer of how much you caught
and completely ignore
the fact that you don't know how much
got through
you suck
like you're a shitty person
and I can't respect you whatsoever
because if you're gonna on me like
I'm so stupid that I can't tell
the difference between what got through
and what got caught and I'm going to
befall for this this misdirection then
you think I'm a idiot right and
you treat me like a idiot
and it's going to come back
it's going to come back yeah you know I
I think the spokesperson is either a
liar
an or completely incompetent
which is you know pick one
pick one I don't care which one you pick
yeah I know you want me to use the c
word but
I can't I can't give it away
gratuitously
uh by the way for the purposes of this
criticism I identify as non-binary
I'm just non-binary as long as I'm
criticizing the spokesperson
as soon as I move to the next topic
right back right back to my old identity
of adult black male all right
um
I think the biggest risk to humanity is
not just the teachers unions
I think it's the bad relationship advice
on social media
I'm not joking
no joke
the biggest risk to America anyway
is the bad relationship advice
on social media
my God Is it bad
my God let me let me give you just an
idea
of the types of bad advice we're getting
number one my favorite is advice that
only works if the two adults are both
functional humans who
who really have their together
that addresses almost nobody
if we were functional you know we and a
couple if you were functional you
probably didn't need much advice in the
first place
but very few how often do two functional
people get together
have you ever heard anybody talk about
their divorce
do they ever say you know
I was very functional and so was my
partner but you know didn't work out for
some reason
no they always say the other person is
bad crazy
or a narcissist right
right the guy is always abusive
narcissist
and the woman's always bad crazy
you know even if they're not
so there's no such thing as these these
two functional people getting together
and working through their working
through their issues with their good
tools
oh
I think that happens for some people
so if you're giving advice that could
only work in the rarest of situations
it doesn't help now this is analogous to
my criticism of success advice
do you know what kind of advice doesn't
help
success advice that only works for
really smart people
because you might not be one
right
so when I talk about
um
forming a talent stack or the systems
are better than goals do you notice that
that works for everybody
I don't know if anybody's picked that up
but that you know probably the two most
important contributions I'll make to
um civilization is
the talent stack idea putting together
talents that work well together
and having a system as opposed to a goal
those two things work for everybody
smart people dumb people criminals
non-criminals like it just it's as good
a generic advice but man when I hear the
advice about
learn to code
maybe but I'm not sure everybody can
learn to code right that's not good
advice
so same with relationships
um here's another category
uh advice that made a lot of sense in
the 50s
I'm seeing a lot of advice
that was just perfect for the 50s
but the things have changed a little bit
and your old traditional
traditional situation it might have been
better you know the traditional family
it might have been better but you're not
going back like sort of the horse got
out of the barn there a little bit so
that that advice is a little a bit of a
problem
how about number three
I'm seeing a place for men that's so
host to it in human reproduction
advice for men
that so about what women want and how
hard it is to satisfy them and happen if
you get married
it's it I've seen more honest advice
than I've ever seen in my life honest
advice would end civilization
because the only reason we do things
that make civilization go forward is
because we're hypnotized by civilization
to think that we should do things a
certain way that
helps reproduction
if you were just looking out for
yourself probably you would make
different decisions
but you know we're sort of reproduction
optimized
so we're going to reproduce no matter
what
um and I would say Andrew
Tate is you know on that list
so they're they're The Men Who say
you tell the woman exactly what you will
put up with
and then if she if she crosses that line
there's no forgiveness you just walk
away and break it off
how does that advice work in the real
world
ah
well if you're Andrew taint it probably
works great for him
it might it might be perfect because
he's got resources and he can travel the
world and he can just get rid of one
girl and get another
now suppose everybody took his advice
and you all said you give me you give me
 once and I'm out of here
you know I'm in charge
I'm in charge that's how this is going
to work as soon as you know you stop uh
understanding that oh you can you're
you're free
go go make it somewhere else do you
think that would work
no it would end all reproduction
the the only reason we reproduce is
because men don't quite realize that the
evolutionary purpose of a woman is to
drain a man's resources and transfer it
to children
if you if you see if you see humans as a
machine
you know like if you're looking at an
engine you say all right the carburetor
does this the spark plugs do this if you
just look at Humanity as a machine the
purpose of women is to take resources
for men
and not to leave them alive or healthy
nobody needs that
all you need is the kids to be alive and
healthy if the kids are doing good then
reproduction has been satisfied and
that's all Evolution cares about
Evolution never said hey let's make men
happy
instead
it went cheap
instead of making men happy with I don't
know how you do it but it'd be hard
men have been designed by Evolution
apparently
to believe that tomorrow is going to be
better
if they just give the woman what she's
asking for
she won't be unhappy tomorrow
because you will solve their problem
and if men did not have the illusion
that women have problems that can be
solved and then everything's good
because the problem is solved if we if
we could ever get out of that illusion
everything would be break
but men stay with it because we're
pretty sure that was just a temporary
problem
I'm sure that that won't happen again
tomorrow
and maybe it doesn't but it's a
different thing so here's the most the
most important thing you need to know
about women
they're designed to keep their man
unhappy
because if the man is happy he's not
going to do anything for him
If he if the woman projects herself as
being unhappy the man will say all right
all right you're ruining my whole day
I'll give you that thing and then
tomorrow because I solve this problem
tomorrow is going to be good
at least tomorrow is going to work out
and then the woman
realizes that this happy man isn't going
to give her anything so she gets unhappy
again
and then the guy's all right one more
day I'll just do this other thing
repeat forever
now
if men understood this
and I could even tell you and like we're
so trained to not see the world that way
that I can't just tell you and then you
can see it
um
but am I wrong
imagine just taking your own
relationship and imagine you took uh
Andrew Dane's advice
and man let me ask you this married men
he takes his advice if if your woman
doesn't give you what you want you just
walk out you say we're done
we're done how would that work in your
life
it wouldn't work at all it wouldn't work
at all
because you're not Andrew teen and you
can't get on your private jet and go to
another country and
and Will some Romanian girl that doesn't
know you right
now I'm not saying he hasn't worked
worked on a good system for himself
and I compliment him for that and Andrew
Tate is doing a great
career Financial you know energy monster
kind of job for himself
for himself
but I don't think his advice is going to
work for all of you necessarily
oh here's another category
uh advice for women about what men want
as if giving men what they want would
make a woman happy
I keep hearing you know women you have
to know that you know men need you know
some quiet time and you know they they
need to be appreciated and the advice
sounds really good
sounds really good like wow
seems like that those are all the things
the man would want do you know what's
wrong with that advice
you're giving advice to somebody who
doesn't want that advice
they know how to make the man happy
they keep him unhappy intentionally
because making him happy would be
terrible for them
they wouldn't get what they wanted like
I just said right they have to keep him
slightly unhappy all the time that's how
this entire operating system there's no
second way to do it
all right unless you know if there's
some rare very functional people
and
uh
here's here's one
this is just me being an
so I'll say it first so you don't have
to
so the fifth one on my list is just me
being a little bit of an
and the fifth one is advice from
relationship experts who spend most of
their time on the road
uh I'm just gonna let that sit there
yeah
I don't want to hear
I do not want to hear relationship
advice from somebody who doesn't have to
be home very much
you know what I mean
I feel like we'd all do a little bit
better
if we were home
and that that's especially what I feel
when I hear um and uh and to be honest
if you haven't picked it up a lot of
this is uh indirect criticism of Jordan
Peterson's relationship advice
now Jordan Peterson is genuinely
a super smart guy and when he says
things they always make sense right and
you know if people could do the things
that he's he's recommending they'd
probably be great but I think he does he
I think he does advice for functional
people who largely don't exist
and
he models being away from home a lot
because it seems like he gets around
I know I feel like that's got to be part
of it
and and he said something that I saw
yesterday I don't know when he said it
but I saw a clip of Jordan Peterson
saying that you know being a being a
High character man and and building a
you know functional relationship and
especially a family is really the only
thing that's going to make you happy
when you reach the age of 60.
have you ever heard him say that like
when you reach a certain age you know
all of your cheap joy and cheap sex and
all that it's not gonna that's not gonna
feed you once you're 60 what are you
going to do still be a playboy at 60.
now interestingly he just turned 60.
so that's his age
and
I was sitting there before before I
heard that at age 65. I was sitting
there thinking damn I just have good
days lately
like like ever since I you know I got
off that pharmaceutical nightmare a few
several weeks ago but I've had nothing
but good days like I wake up and I go oh
man
I'm gonna like have a nice walk in the
sun I'm I gotta get a massage later
like I'll just do one good thing after
another I'll go play with my dog
even the work I do
is work I don't mind doing I miss
arguably this is work but barely
and I was thinking to myself I was
perfectly happy and then I listened to
Jordan Peterson told me that I was you
know empty and had no no no chance of
happiness because I'm not in the family
and I thought
Maybe
we'll see he could be right about that
all right
um
did you hear CNN playing uh cell phone
cell phone conversation of a Russian
soldier in Ukraine calling his
girlfriend and complaining about
the Russian leadership
now that the
um I guess the uh
the summary of that
is that the the soldiers that the
Russian soldiers said that the
leadership got um
let's say shelled
and they packed up and they moved
further away from the front line
but they didn't move their troops
further from the front line
they didn't move the troops further and
the soldiers like what the hell like
we're just getting apparently half of
them had been wiped out
so they and and the soldier was talking
about
killing murdering their own Commanders
now I don't know if it's just one guy
spouting off to his girlfriend but he
actually said it you know there that
they were getting ready to go just kill
their own Commander and
and I you know who knows how
representative it is but one of the
things that the soldier said is that if
it wasn't for this you know ragtagged
bunch of people who were half of them
have been killed and they don't want to
be there that that's the only thing
keeping Ukraine from marching to Moscow
and I thought to myself
have the Russian soldiers Been Told
that they're protecting Moscow
do you think that they believe maybe
they've been propagandized the Ukraine
is the aggressor
do they believe that a Ukrainian
aggressor because maybe
I mean
uh you are ignorant concerning Jordan
Peterson igles says aren't we all
how could I not be ignorant about Jordan
Peterson
would I not need to read his mind to
have a complete picture
I I suppose you've done that have you
have you done the work you did some
research dug a little deeper developed a
machine that could read his mind
complete all the picture fill in all the
black the dots
all right well I just want to mock you a
little bit
for that
all right um
student loans so and let me let me
summarize everything that you hear out
of Ukraine is propaganda
you know I just have to remind you
because every once in a while people say
how did Scott
you know believe that propaganda I don't
believe it
I'm just saying it exists you shouldn't
believe anything out of Ukraine it is
entirely possible that the Russian
troops are right at the point of total
collapse
but I wouldn't bet on it right it's
possible
um
so the White House found a new way to
screw the country by extending the
student loan repayment until uh June
2023.
and that's an interesting time because
doesn't that mean that it would expire
it would expire before the election
is that when they wanted to expire
because then it looks like the Democrats
picked something that would expire
I think they want to make it look like
it's a Republican's fault I suppose I
could spin it that way
but anyway it's a
as weasel plans go
it's a pretty Weasley plant
the the fact that they're selling to
their idiot uh
their idiot base that they're actually
going to be able to get away with
this loan repayment stuff
it's just amazing to me
all right I want to I want to give you
my favorite story of the day you know as
you know I have a mascot does everybody
know who my mascot is
I want to make sure that I've got the
word around you is Keith olberman now
the way this works is that a mascot is
somebody who starts as just a Critic
but if they're really really good at it
or really energetic and really
entertaining
then they rise to the level of mascot so
in my life Keith olberman has been
criticizing me for 20 years and it's all
crazy and funny
so like once I realized he was my mascot
then I look forward to every time I hear
from him
so it just sort of turns it into a
positive but uh Tim Poole got himself a
mascot
so and and maybe a better one than mine
I mean I thought olberman would be hard
to top
but Tim Poole
he got himself
a good mascot
I'm going to play it for you
some little kids like that go get them
boys guys go get them please please vote
for our molesters and our pedophiles
Republicans say Republicans you're
guilty okay and I'll tell you right now
the number one reason they constantly
talk about pedophilia is because it's
going through their heads non-stop
they're thinking about kids I guarantee
it the reason Temple wears a beanie is
because he's trying to contain the
pedophilia that's in his head that's
what he's always talking about it he's
seeing it everywhere why because he's
projecting and the right way he's like
yes I love how they molest the little
kids like that go get them boys guys go
get em please please
foreign
Republicans say Republicans you're
guilty okay and I'll tell you right now
the number one reason they constantly
talk about pedophilia is because it's
going through their heads non-stop
they're thinking about kids I guarantee
it the reasons
um so uh
Temple retwees it
you know you've done a bad job as a
Critic when the target of your criticism
retweets it and the first part of the
retweet is LOL
I
said Tim Poole says LOL OMG this is
amazing it's weird because I'm not a not
Catholic conservative or republican like
they can't understand that Independents
oppose them too
uh anyone who isn't in the cult is
Republican and he says uh Jack I love
you buddy which is perfect
so if you want a lesson uh how to handle
uh your your craziest people
read with them and just give them an LOL
retweet and let people decide for
themselves so that that was about as
perfect as it could be
and uh my other favorite story
[Music]
Elon Musk
finds a closet full of uh stay woke
shirts
at Twitter
is the entire
entire closet full of secret closet of
hashtag work that's for sure here we are
at the most
thing that Elizabeth so
so everything that you imagined about
Twitter
is apparently true like every every like
everything you imagined that could be
maybe you know not quite ideal it was
all true
now
may I add my own suggestions
I think Elon Musk should take all these
shirts and give them to the homeless
not only that
but I think
I think that Republicans should make
lots more shirts that also have Democrat
slogans on them and also give them to
the homeless in fact I would give the
homeless free close forever as long as
that this is the free clothing had a had
a pro-democrat statement on it
and by the way I wouldn't have anything
anti-democrat it would be their own it'd
be like vote for Hillary
you know Joe Biden is my president you
know that sort of thing and just make it
free but you know good enough quality
and you know clean and maybe even do a
laundry service
now imagine offering laundry service for
the homeless
like actually literally wash their
clothes but also part of that provide
them new fresher clothes that have
Democrat slogans on
come on that's you love that idea
it's
yes democrats for Fentanyl
ah that would be funny all right
um and I saw a parody on Twitter that I
honestly couldn't tell I had to tweet to
ask if it was parody Or real good I
didn't care so it was somebody saying
that they were a fired uh fact Checker
at Twitter
and it was so spot on of what looks like
it could have been an actual fired fact
Checker at Twitter
that I couldn't tell it was hilarious
but I didn't know if it was hilarious
because it was parody Or it was
hilarious because it was real I actually
couldn't tell like legitimately
legitimately I didn't even have the best
guess now it turns out it was parody and
it was it was labeled parody in the
profile but I didn't want to check like
obviously I could have checked in a
second right but I didn't want to look
because I didn't want to know if it if
it was parody
I didn't want to know I want to I just
wanted to enjoy it for his beauty
without knowing for a while
um
here's another in the category of things
you suspected that turns out are totally
true
I saw Dinesh D'Souza a tweet where he
was talking about uh Twitter and said
that
um
that the censorship was deployed as a
one-way operation against conservatives
all right so that's a that's a big
statement right this is sort of
conspiracy theory statement you would
have heard you know a year and a half
ago and you would have said well that
just sounds like
you know Dinesh is making just a purely
political statement right so censorship
has been deployed as a one-way operation
against conservatives
and then Elon Musk replies in the
comments with one word
correct
correct
[Laughter]
now do you think that Elon Musk now
knows exactly
uh how things were being being censored
and why
probably
probably
musk knows exactly who got censored and
why and as someone else pointed out
maybe it was Dinesh pointed out I think
Dinesh pointed out that you're not
seeing a bunch of band leftists coming
back on the platform
do you know why
because there weren't any and there
weren't any
it was exactly what you thought it was
it was just a way to suppress
conservatives apparently
all right
um
so ladies and gentlemen I feel like
there was a few funny stories that I
missed
uh
oh the krasenstein brothers yeah you
know
Kathy Griffin
well Kathy Griffin was sort of a special
case wasn't she and you know I thought
it was uh funny and smart
the musk brought Kathy Griffin back in
the first wave of people brought back
because that showed he was at least
considering you know both sides of the
aisle for for comebacks and I thought
that was just a smart way to play it
uh do I have a my pillow promo code I
don't
I do need some new pillows though I
should get some
um
now how many of you are noticing a an
improvement in the troll criticism
activity on Twitter
I would say that my my troll
troll traffic is down at least 80
percent
in fact I'll even go further the people
who criticize me now might actually be
real people
they might actually just be people who
disagree with me
it feels very different yeah I I can
feel my metabolism
doesn't do the same thing it did even a
year ago on Twitter a year ago on
Twitter I could feel my body catch on
fire after a few tweets
but that doesn't happen now I when I
checked Twitter now it feels like a
pleasant informational humorous
kind of experience doesn't it feels very
different now but here's my question
a hundred percent of my tweets
still instantly get a uh a spam
I think you've all seen it it pretends
to be Elon Musk giving away something
right but it's all fake but it's instant
and it's as soon as I tweet how in the
world can Twitter not stop that
because the content of the Tweet is
always the same
they don't have any way to instantly
look for you know Elon Musk is not
giving away any Bitcoins or whatever the
hell this is
you've never seen it
are you serious it's in every one of my
tweets including today it happens
instantly
let me let me let me do a test
let me do a test I'm going to do a non
like just a nothing tweet
uh testing
how long
before the
spam hits my comments
because I do wonder if anybody's
watching to see if the content of my
tweet is one that they want to connect
to
so I don't know if it's content related
so I'm going to Tweet this
and if it's automatic the the spam will
be there like usually it's the first
first comment
so let's just test it
Let's test that tweet if any of you are
watching it at the same time
all right
um
the first two comments are not spam
so it's possible that there are humans
deciding which ones to attach the spam
to
do you think that's how it works
do you think a human is doing it
because it happened so quickly
it looks like it's automated
if it doesn't if it doesn't pop up in
like a minute then I won't believe it's
automated
and let's see
show more replies of course more
replies on this one than normal of
course
all right well
I don't see it so I just I guess I don't
know if it's automatic
Erica the excellent has already weighed
in on this tweet
and you're right you're correct Erica
all right
um
is there any stories I missed that don't
involve
Mass tragedies
affected what about Kanye's tweet about
asking Trump to be his running mate oh
did he do that
well
oh Alex Berenson and Tom Elliott are in
a Twitter argument on weed
so Berenson was sort of anti-weed right
so there's one
um
statistic that I follow for weed is life
expectancy
the the only study I've seen
comparing uh you know frequent weed
users with the rest of the public
showed that their life expectancy was
greater than the regular public
now I don't trust studies so I'd have to
see more but what I don't trust is the
ones that say uh this looks like wheat
is even worse for your lungs than
whatever
because it feels like
all those things are suggestive of a
problem that doesn't show up in total
mortality and Attila shows up in total
mortality
have you ever heard of anybody dying of
a weed related problem
have you ever heard you didn't smoke
cigarettes but he died of lung cancer
I've never heard of it
I mean maybe it happens
uh Ali is still suspended Ali Alexander
is still expended somebody says
yeah he's going to be he's going to be
an edge case too
oh I forgot my best joke
can you mentally go back with me in time
I've got to rewind all right
this will be worth it watch this it'll
be just like this it hadn't already
happened and you hadn't already watched
it
so Tim Poole has a new uh mascot uh
Chang uh oyer or uyghur I don't know how
to pronounce his last name
um and you may know Jenkins the poor
man's Alex Jones
okay that's all I wanted to do
now now back back where we were
he's the poor man's Alex Jones
come on that's pretty good
um by the way this is one of my favorite
jokes or a joke is structures
I love the joke structure when you say
somebody is the poor man's somebody else
because you can do it for almost anybody
you'd find somebody who just swear
reminds you of them and is you know
worse or better in some way and then you
say they're the poor man it's always
funny
um
somebody says I'm the poor man's Jordan
Peterson see
that's perfect that and that works yeah
calling me the poor man's Jordan
Peterson is perfect
yeah that is the exact
that that's how you do that
well executed well executed
now I try to be consistent on the
following point
if somebody criticizes me or insults me
in a way that's legitimately funny
I'm just going to go with the joke
I'll just ignore the criticism yeah
because usually it's about the joke not
the criticism and I'll just appreciate
it I appreciate a good joke at my
expense if it's well
well-formed and you know you're going
for the laugh that's fine
um
yay tweeted to use that bar Lago
yeah do you think that uh
do you think that anything can redeem
Kanye
when he does the you know I'm Jewish
stuff
um here's how he could redeem himself
Kanye could just deny and say you know
all that uh I'm more Jewish than the
Jewish people
you know I did some more research and I
found out that uh you know that wasn't
all it was cracked up to be you know
that the research didn't pan out and
then just say
I did more work and now I changed my
mind
could he do that
if you saw Kanye say you know
everybody criticized me I looked into it
and I gotta say
that was just a mistake
I believe he could pull that off
he could pull though because you know
what you know what America really
forgives
well what is it that America is really
forgiving for
we we forgive honest mistakes
when somebody owns it
right if you own your mistake
people
are way okay with you right and I always
thought that was part of Trump's magic
if Trump had said
um elect to be president yea is the poor
man's Kanye that's pretty good uh part
of Trump's Magic
is that he never told he he was a High
character person
and so when things you know the
accusations came out that would go to
his character you would say ah oh yeah
you did tell us that I guess that was
pretty transparent
he actually said running for president
I'm No Angel
I'm No Angel
that is the clear statement you could
ever get that if you dig around you're
going to find some stuff you don't like
but that's not what I'm proposing as
president
as president I'm proposing to do these
things for you I'm not proposing to date
you
right
I'm not I'm not proposing to
sexually harass you so you could care
about it but that's not my proposition
so I'll give you that that's you got
some things in my closet there you're
not gonna like
yeah
um so I think
that yay is a a sympathetic character
meaning that people are primed to want
to like it
would you agree
I think people are primed to want to
like him
so all you have to do is just give us a
path
but he made it impossible
because what am I going to say
oh I agree with the guy saying
anti-semitic things like it just cuts me
off
like I'm not going to go there
so he has to fix that but I want him to
I would like him to fix it like us all
to learn something from it
yay literally and then move on I'd be
fine with that you know I don't think
yay has ever told told us he's complete
has he
has yeah ever said you know
I've got my completely together
you know why don't you be more like me
quite the opposite quite the opposite he
is all he has always told you he's a
that he's basically a mess
who happens to be an artistic genius
both true
he's an artistic genius maybe a business
genius until recently and and he's also
a mess but he's transparent about it you
know mental problems and all
um
Ice Cube passed up 9 million because of
the jab and so he lost some work because
is that what you're saying
yeah he
he's still interesting though
all right
um
anybody watching the World Cup
I guess
Lionel Messi his team lost to Saudi
Arabia
wow
that was a shocker if you don't follow
soccer you don't realize what a you know
World bending shocker that was
now here's a little tip for you
if you don't like watching soccer and
that would be common of a number of
Americans
spend five minutes looking for highlight
reels of Lionel Messi scoring goals
and
it's not like watching soccer
right soccer is a lot of people trying
stuff that doesn't work
oh I tried that pass but somebody got it
oh I tried to get past that guy but he
stopped me it's like a whole bunch of
people who aren't quite good enough to
play soccer playing soccer it looks like
and then Lionel Messi
we'll just dribble through like 13 of
them in a row and then score this
ridiculous goal into the corner and you
watch that and you say I don't know what
I even saw like I don't even know how
any that's possible and you also have to
remember that Messi was told he was too
small to play professional soccer
because he's small
and he's the best player in the world
so you know I guess maybe I root for him
for you know overcoming that obstacle as
well but when you watch Lionel Messi
it's not like watching soccer
you're watching it almost looks like
it's not possible it looks like magic or
something so do yourself a favor
five minutes
of Lionel Messi
YouTube highlight reel it'll just blow
your mind you you won't believe people
can do what he does
he was put on ghg during puberty we'll
see
how tall is he
Alexa how tall is Lionel Messi
he's five seven
all right
ladies and gentlemen I believe that's
just about all I have for today
um this might be
the best live stream you've ever seen
Tom Brady is the poor man's Lionel Messi
okay
maybe there is a limit to that there
might be a limit to how well that joke
works
huh
um
did
exception to the rule
all right
um yeah the news was interesting but
there wasn't much of it today so I'm
gonna go do some other stuff
and
all of you have a great day on YouTube
I'll talk to the locals people in a
minute
