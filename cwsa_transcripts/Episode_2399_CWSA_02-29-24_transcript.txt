[Music]
good morning to everybody except for
racist YouTube I'd like to uh welcome
you to coffee with Scott Adams the best
thing that's ever happened to you and if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
all you really need is a cup or mug or a
glass a tanker chel Stein a canteen
juger flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure of the dopamine end of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous zp and it
happens now
go happy leap
here it's especially hard for dyslexics
but I'm going to power through it as you
know February 29th is not even a real
day so any crimes you commit today don't
count so go
NES well let's talk about the simulation
uh apparently mid Journey says they're
hoping to release what they call New
consistent character features consistent
character now what I think that
means is that if you create a character
um it won't create a whole new character
if you want to create a new scene so the
problem with the old AIS is you can say
uh show me a movie of Scott walking down
the street and then it would and then
you'd say now show me the next scene
where Scott turns the corner it can't do
that because it would it would do a
whole new me a whole version of the city
differently there wouldn't be any
continuity but if you can make the
characters
consistent it means I think you can have
them pick up where they left
off now that's not as important as what
I call in a Shor story I'm working on
right now persistent characters so a
consistent character would be that one
that doesn't change every time you
update the scene but a persistent one
would be in a video game in which when
you leave the game and log off the
character still lives its
life that's coming and when a character
can live its life even when nobody's
watching maybe even have experiences to
talk about l within the realm of his
world it's very small leap to
programming that character to think
they're
real and then you're all going to see
that we're in a simulation because once
you see that we can build one and we can
we we very clearly have all of the
technology to build a simulation now
you're going to say to me but Scott the
characters and the simulation that the
simulation that we would be able to
build today would see these SE enormous
flaws in their
Universe right that they'd see all these
mistakes and things that don't quite fit
together because we're not really so
good that we could build a universe that
would be all
consistent for example uh how do we even
have enough Computing so that we
remember everything in history and if
you and I have a disagreement you know
we we both saw the same history somehow
way too complicated couldn't possibly do
it but you you know what we could do we
could very easily program the persistent
characters to believe they're seeing a
consistent environment when they're not
we can give them cognitive
dissonance so if uh you and I have a
different memory of what happened 10
minutes ago they don't have to solve it
that would be hard M making everything
consistent would be Beyond durability
but to program a character who lives
forever within the digital world and
then its mind has been programmed to
believe that everything looks fine they
see all the detail even though it's not
there they believe there's something
beyond what they can see even though
there isn't and their history would be
created on demand so in other words they
would never see the new Forest until
they walked in that direction and
entered it if the forest is created as
they enter it which I'm pretty sure our
reality is the same way then it means it
also created history because the forest
had to start as acorns and you know
seeds before it grew so it's creating a
history on
demand we are at that point in history
where we can create creatures who
believe they're living in a real world
but we can show that they are definitely
not and that's who we are we'll figure
that out well there's a new study that
says married people are a lot happier
what do you think I'm going to call that
could it be
backwards science backwards
science well let me see I'm thinking
about getting
married uh let's see I got a couple
choices uh Angry
 angry complaining unhappy
depressed unhappy complaining oh
whoow there's a happy
one will you marry me I know we just met
B honly my options are kind of low I
know I mean just think we just met but I
I don't want to lose you you're the
first one I met so how about we get
married no I would say that this looks
like backward science to me because it
seems kind of obvious that people who
are happy and healthy are more likely to
get somebody to marry them and be happy
about
it do you
disagree let's do another one there's
another study uh it's h published in the
hill that marijuana is very correlated
with a 25% higher risk of heart attacks
and oh 42% higher risk of stroke whoa
whoa so I guess that's
true should we learn a few things about
how to evaluate science when it's in the
news Okay number one if you didn't know
any anything about even the topic of the
study what are the odds is true you
don't even know the topic give me the
odds 50%
50% you're starting with only a 50%
because a half of all studies can't be
re reproduced turns out that they're
just bad
studies
so moment one there's only a 50% chance
is true now do you think that this study
was a randomized control told to study
the the highest level of scientific
rigor no it was not it was observational
and it was asking people how they
feel hey do you smoke marijuana every
day yes I do uh did you ever have any
heart disease well as a matter of fact I
did that's the lowest level of
credibility so if you're starting with
something that is only 50% likely to be
true before you even know what the topic
is
and then you look at those things the
50% that at least could be true and you
say it wasn't one of those good studies
like a randomized controlled
Placebo it's maybe only
25% so I would say by its
nature of being a study and also not
being the good kind best case
25% now here here's another uh rule of
thumb that you'll find quite useful if a
scientific study does not
agree with observation it doesn't mean
the science is wrong because our
observations you know can be faulty but
you'll have much more Comfort if they're
compatible for
example uh I believe that smoking
cigarettes is more likely to give you
lung cancer and indeed I know some
people who had lung cancer and all but
one of them smok cigarettes so there the
science and my observation perfect I
believe that eating a lot of desserts
and sugary food will make you gain
weight science says so and then I
observe my friends oh yeah the people
who eat the most of that kind of food
they gain weight very
compatible do you know anybody who
smokes marijuana every day and died of a
heart
attack I've never even heard of
it I'm sure it happens I'm sure it
happens it must happen right because
heart attack is pretty common I never
even heard of it or a stroke never even
heard of it now that now that's the
lowest level that's a very low level of
certainty right because I don't know
everybody I don't know if they smoke
every day right but I can say that I
can't observe it in the real
world would would anybody agree with
that
observation that if it's a 25%
difference that feels like enough I
would have know noticed wow those
marijuana smokers are dropping like
flies 25% is big enough to notice in the
real world but I don't but I
don't um here's the next thing you
should look at is there anything in the
world that's happening that would cause
somebody who has money let's say an
industry type of person you know maybe
somebody in the uh corporate world who
would want to do a fake study for any
reason
well is it true that uh drinking is down
among young people and marijuana is up
is that true I believe that's true now
if you were the alcohol
industry and you wanted to PE you wanted
young people to think you know maybe
that alcohol is a little safer than you
thought compared to the marijuana
because you know a lot of kids say well
the marijuana is safe the alcohol is not
but maybe the drug maybe the AL industry
would like you to believe it's a little
closer than you thought in Risk now
that's kind of unfair isn't it to blame
the alcohol industry for fake studies
Ian that's pretty
unfair have they ever done anything like
that
before did we spend 30 years imagining
that the studies that said alcohol is
good for you uh as long as you're
moderate about it and recently we found
out that none of that was true who who
do you think funded those studies the
ones who said alcohol is good for your
health what do you
think when I was a kid uh scientists and
doctors were saying that cigarettes were
good for your
health because of probably some studies
that might have been funded by the
cigarette people I don't know but
probably so yes we have one one uh
possibility that alcohol use is down and
if you suspected that people are
terrible like they always have been you
would say huh who funded the
study so I click the link to go look at
the study do you think it says who
funded
it do you think that's part of the write
up in medical journal who gave us the
money and even if it did say who gave
you the money do you think you'd know
the real Source because it'd be pretty
easy to hide who's giving you
money so I'm not saying that there's any
you know direct evidence that the
alcohol industry is trying to make
marijuana look worse I'm just saying it
would be
normal it would be normal to expect it
because remember the alcohol industry
isn't one person it's a whole bunch of
individual actors any of them could have
made the decision to fund the
study all right is there anything else
though in the in the atmosphere
something in the news that would make
somebody want to fake fake a study I'm
not saying it's fake I'm saying is there
anything that would make somebody want
to fake it okay is there anything else
in the news about uh let's say uh excess
uh heart disease and
strokes have you seen anything like that
in the news lately oh yes there's a
massive concern that excess deaths are
up and we don't know why we don't know
why and and some people say it's because
of the vaccinations although I think the
excess death started before the
vaccinations so I'd need a fact check on
that but if you were the big farm
industry and you and you thought that
people were looking at all cause
mortality and they saw too many heart
attacks and strokes and they were going
to blame you for it because you're the
ones who rolled out those
vaccinations what would you do if you
had dark money to fix things well if it
were me I would confuse the topic
by saying you know you're right young
people are having a lot of heart disease
but at the same time marijuana use among
young people is way up it's all being
legalized in States I feel like you know
you really can't sort that out you know
the young people do a lot of marijuana
and they have more heart disease lately
but more Mar it's probably the more
marijuana you know there are lots of
things going on it'd be hard to it's
going to be hard to sort out what the
actual
causes now I'm not accusing them because
I have no direct
information I'm I'm simply telling you
how you
should um look at a study you should
always look who funded it and you should
ask yourself is there anybody who would
benefit not just a little bit but is
there anybody who would benefit
enormously like staying out of jail and
making a billion dollars that's a pretty
big benefit um for doing something that
would be sketchy if did
hypothetically all right here's another
one uh do you believe that when they did
this study and it was people you know
just reporting their own experience uh
do you think that they only talked to
the uh recreational
users or did they talk to people use it
use it
medicinally in addition to the people
who use it recreationally what do you
think well my guess is that they asked
both of them and what could you imagine
would be true about a group of people
who use a medicine every day would it be
true that people who choose to use a
medicine every day are among the most
healthy people in the world or would
there be something about that group the
medicine everyday group that might tell
you they've got a little bit of maybe
less healthy situation in general and
did the study tell you if they broke out
the people that they that are not
medicine takers to see if the
recreational users are dying at this
High
rate
no no all right so I don't know if the
study is good or not I'm saying that if
you didn't know how to look at it with
that filter all those different
filters you'd be a little bit you know
maybe easier to fool there's a story I
don't know if it's true yet but
allegedly the company Panera
breed uh negotiated maybe with Governor
Nome to be exempt from the new minimum
wage law $20 minimum wage and that's
after the owner reportedly donated to
Nome for the New York Post now I think I
to wait a little bit to find out if
there's any more details on that but
that would be a direct bribe wouldn't
it I don't know if it's illegal
but in a common sense way that would
just be a bribe I don't know what else
you call it if it's true so imagine the
amount of opposition research on Nome
that you haven't seen
yet just just hold in your mind how much
the Republicans must be holding back you
know just in case they need it because
they don't need to destroy them until
they need to destroy them and it's too
early so I just feel like there's some
group group of Republicans who really
have the good stuff like the really good
stuff and they're just like ah hold hold
I don't know how much longer we can
hold but uh I would say if they slot
Nome in at the last minute for Biden
you're going to see an opposition uh
opposition research drop like you've
never seen in your
life it's going to be one for the ages
that's just a guess it's just a guess I
think it's going to be one for the
ages keep in mind uh that um nome's
ex-wife is on the Trump
team if there's anybody who knows where
the bodies are
buried I mean just think about it what
what what could she tell you or any any
ex-wife just say any ex-wife what could
an ex-wife have on opposition rep
research than nobody else would
know all right um there's a rich guy Yan
shck he was a former Goldman Sachs guy
he's trying to build this whole uh uh
design from scratch home in California
he needs some kind of ballot approval to
to get the zoning or whatever but uh
it's between San Francisco and
Sacramento and it would have uh 20,000
homes with and they'd build all the
transit infrastructure in school and
jobs and stuff now Reed Hoffman and
Lorena Powell jobs is also behind this
so it's looks like a very Democrat thing
uh which is irrelevant to the story in
this case but I've been telling you for
some time that the biggest economic
driver that's not robots and maybe not
AI will be designing towns from
scratch designing them from scratch do
you know how much better a city or a
town could be if you designed the whole
thing from scratch your transportation
would be almost zero oh by the way
there's a place like that you should
look into
Estonia Estonia is a little over a
million
people and they're very
high-tech so everything you need to do
in the government in Estonia you can do
on your phone including paying taxes you
just have an app so they basically
automated the government
they just automated it you just do stuff
on your app and it's all you
need and transportation in Estonia is
free and perfect you can easily go
anywhere all
free so they don't have much traffic
problem and the pollution is way down
now Estonia had the advantage of
probably coming after World War II and
you maybe it's a smaller place and
whatever but in a way
that they're not a perfect example of
Designing from scratch but they are a
good example of
Designing right so they apparently they
have real high education in a lot of you
know engineer techy people and they just
decided to design it
correctly and look what happened
apparently it's pretty good lifestyle
there so designing towns from scratch is
the biggest thing and I hope this
works uh we know now that Hunter said he
was either high or drunk when he did the
famous phone call with his Chinese guy
he was trying to shake down for money
and he said I'm sitting here with my
father he's not going to like it uh that
was the $5 million Shakedown and
apparently he still got the money you
got the money and um I guess one of the
people he was trying to shake down was
this guy um
ho that was his last name
hoe
so I don't know who is the best
negotiator in the whole world some
people say Trump is good at negotiating
he
is but hunter is the first person I've
ever heard of whoever got a hoe to give
him
money yeah
yep in my entire life I've never had a
hoe give me a
diamond not even one time and I've tried
I'd be like hey ho got any diamonds and
they'd be like a bunch of bad words I
can't say and I'd say if I were Hunter
Biden I could get that diamond from you
ho but but no I don't have his
negotiating skills so what I
think and by the way he did that while
high and
drunk it's sort of like
uh you know sort of like doing the dance
back backwards and high heels you know
what I mean I mean that's a higher level
of difficulty he got a diamond from a
hoe and he negotiated while he was high
either high or drunk and he was so
inebriated he doesn't even remember I
don't know was I high or was I drunk but
got it done so here's what I think I
think we should send him over there to
negotiate with
Putin and you know give him six shots of
wh Whiskey and a blunt and see if he can
make some peace because we don't have a
negot her like that
anywhere he's our best
guy oh if you don't think you don't
think Hunter is our best
negotiator please you're the same people
who think Joe Biden isn't the very best
person to Democrats have for
President you know that's not true so
grow up will you just grow
up well the I guess uh the thing we call
the president that d R bundle of sticks
soaked in Hobo piss that we call Joe
Biden is going to go down to the border
and check it out he's going down to
Brownsville going to
Brownsville I'm pretty sure that's what
he says every time he goes to the
bathroom all right I'll be back got to
go to
Brownsville anyway um he did not he did
not contact the union the border patrol
Union and so the border patrol Union in
response to him going down there today
uh says keep our name out of your mouth
today they posted keep keep your name
out of her mouth
today because they're afraid that Biden
is going to say that the union supports
uh what he requested for border border
funding and uh so keep your name at keep
our name out of your mouth
today well uh Putin has uh threatened in
some speech you know nuclear war against
the United States if we keep supporting
Ukraine and he ask you know what are you
crazy don't you know we have nukes that
can nuke you what are you doing but
although Putin is a let's say he's a
formidable leader uh with a nuclear
Arsenal and award that he seems to be
winning but I feel like it's kind of a
kind of a close comparison between Biden
and Putin for example uh Biden was just
on one of those uh evening shows that's
a a non- Gutfeld one you've heard of
those that if you watch any late night
TV there's there's
Gutfeld and then there's like these
miscellaneous ones with people who are
all the same people I I think they're
different people there's like one is
called a Seth and there's a Jimmy and
maybe another Jimmy are there two
jimmies and Seth something like that but
on one of those shows uh
Biden uh because he can't speak and
deliver a joke they did an elaborate
setup where the Biden could get a laugh
by simply putting his sunglasses
on so he was being he was asked if he
was embracing the uh the what is it uh
dark Biden meme you know where he acts
all awesome and his eyes glow and stuff
like that and to make his Cas he put on
his sunglasses and that that was sort of
the punchline so they literally had to
craft a
situation where one of the jimmies or
the seths does all the work to set it up
and all Biden had to do was take out his
sunglasses and put them
on it went like
this it was less than than awesome did
the audience love it
oh that's my seal
impression yeah seal
impression well Biden needs no cognitive
test uh according to his
doctors he's just fine and I like to
point out that I think he's found the
dementia Sweet
Spot the dementia sweet spot and this is
something we can all aspire to I want to
find that place where I'm still smart
enough to be the leader of the entire
Democratic
party but not capable enough to stand
trial for my
crimes Sweet
Spot yeah it's inspiring if you think
about it you hit that that's called
sticking the
landing well Mike Benz who has
miraculously not been assassinated yet H
that's weird uh but there's more to the
story besides the fact that he hasn't
been assassinated by the CIA yet um he
says if you guys think Russia gate is
Over You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet Russia
gate 3.0 is going to be the mother of
them all if the Ukraine Aid is denied I
would not rule out the blob that's the
security State and the Democrats and
permanent people Etc uh The Blob burning
the entire Republican party to the
ground then in its ashes installing a
Nicki
haly
huh well that's pretty
scary so I guess the idea would be to
you know jail Trump and uh basically
take out the Republicans one way or the
other and just have a one party system
and a complete coup now the only thing
that makes me safe feel
safe is that there aren't any members of
the the Democratic party who who have
any history of using let's say the CIA
to overthrow
countries
what are you telling me that there are
Democrats and our security um
apparatus has experience overthrowing
countries like with c and stuff really
well how many times they done at
once 80
times my God I should have done more
research
80
times well but not any countries it
matter right it's like little you know
morania and
L
and you basically places you can't what
Ukraine
Ukraine my God 2014 the United States
and the Democrats took over an entire
country wow so well looks like they can
do
that well I don't know how much we
should worry about this but it does look
possible I would say that um Mike Ben's
statement would have looked insane five
years
ago it would have looked just insane
today it's kind of a coin flip now I
think we'll be fine because I'm an
optimist but is it possible that there
would be literally a coup in the United
States I don't think so because they
already own it the coup already
happened the coup happened a long time
ago what what they do to keep Trump out
of office might be just details but no
they're they're already firmly in charge
will they will they lose the illusion
that we have a democracy in the vote
counts and all that they might so really
what you're talking about is them just
dropping the
illusion that voting matters that might
happen we might lose the illusion the
voting voting matter
all right um Trump did a uh a video in
which he called Biden a mental
and says he's making up stories about
him forgetting his wife's name and he
explained why that was a fake
news and I kind of liked it because uh
the way Trump did it he did it with real
high energy you know as usual but even
even really more commanding so a lot of
it was just showing how commanding he is
compared to the competition you know he
didn't say that but you could see that
he was putting the the energy emphasis
into it um but that was good and
persuasion wise that was good stuff and
the mental thing is very quotable
so that's good
stuff um the part where you you know
have to explain why it was fake news is
not ideal but it's better than not doing
it so anyway that was good play um
uh Karin John Pierre talked about the
lack of a cognitive test for Biden and
said quote folks need to understand that
the president passes a cognitive test
every day so why do we even have them it
makes you wonder why we have them if
you're passing it every
day anyway there's nothing they won't
tell you that doesn't sound
stupid all right here's the story and I
want you to see if you can if if you can
determine what's really going on all
right so the story is that there's a
going to be a new election security task
force well that sounds good doesn't it
an election security task force
finally finally an election security
task force now maybe we'll have some you
know confidence that the election was
done
correctly good that's good news election
security task force did I ever tell you
that if you only know what is happening
you don't know
anything but if you know
who you know
everything well maybe we should dig into
this a little bit because the what
sounded great I like having a election
security task force that's exactly what
I want let's see who's in charge of it
Democratic oh Democratic governor
Shapiro of
Pennsylvania
show okay so the Democrats are going to
decide what is
fair okay that's terrible that's
terrible but at least we don't have to
worry that he's somehow you know working
with because this would be terrible
imagine if he were working with some
kind
of intelligence group or
CIA I mean I'm not suggesting that I'm
just saying that would be terrible
because that would be the worst case
scenario wouldn't it imagine that
imagine if it's a Democrat
so he's already biased but then on top
of that the people that we imagined
would be rigging in elections you know
intelligence type
people that if he were in any way
associated with them or working with
them that would make this story look
pretty
bad uh let's see I read this story in
NBC
News NBC
news
so is there anybody here who doesn't
make that connection
so I I listen to Glenn Greenwald who's
always saying that NBCS is you know the
primary they their
story so you've got a CIA identified
outlet that most of the country doesn't
know that um and you got a Democrat
saying he's going to do election
security you should assume that that
really means the
opposite it looks a lot more like
protecting fraud than detecting it
so remember my rule if you only know
what is happening you don't know
anything if you know who is involved you
know
everything
allegedly speaking of
rigging um an Illinois judge just uh
ruled that Trump should be removed from
the state ballot citing his citing the
insurrectionist
ban let's say let's see if you can guess
is there anybody here who is not up on
that
story uh for only the people who are not
up on the story uh what would you guess
is the demographic of the
judge if you guessed black Democrat
judge you'd probably be right on right
now am I saying that there's something
wrong with black women
no if you're hearing that you're hearing
the wrong story is there am I saying
there's a clear
correlation of black women judges
attorney generals um prosecutors going
after Trump in what looks like a
weaponized prosecution yes the the
correlation is unmistakable couldn't
possibly miss it is that me saying
there's something wrong with black women
no you could replace the black women in
the story with anybody and get the same
result under the condition that the
person you replaced them with had also
been told that they're stopping Hiller
and specifically somebody who's bad for
them in particular so let's say you
spent seven years telling the country
that if you're an elbonian Trump hates
you oh he's so prejudice against
elbonian and not only that if you're an
elbonian woman he's probably raped you a
few times am I right and if he hasn't
gotten around to you yet well it's only
because he's going twice on EEG and
Carrol he's going to get around to it
all that raping and grabbing so
you're an elbonian woman and every day
you wake up and the News tells you that
you've got somebody who's a candidate
who's a elbonian
grabbing uh prejudice against elbon
and he might be Hiller he's not just a
little Prejudice he might be Hiller
level Prejudice right now you're a
judge and you're an elbonian woman and
you become a judge and by weird
coincidence the very person who's the
monster against all elbonian especially
the elbonian women he he hasn't gotten
around to raping yet what are you going
to do do you use your power to stop
Hitler or do you let history judge you
because you allowed that monster to go
to off get into office and start
discriminating probably rounding up and
raping every elbonian woman he can
find what is the more ethical and moral
way to
go I would
argue that this black female judge did
the most moral and ethical thing you
could do under the
circumstances which is that her illusion
is that she's stopping
Hitler
likewise um the prosecutors in all of
the cases against them the AGS and the
prosecutors who are black and especially
women again nothing wrong with being
black nothing wrong with being woman
that's fine it's just that that
demographic was targeted to be
brainwashed extra hard because the
Democrats need to keep them you know
keep them in the Democrat
fold so with No Malice or bad feelings
for the black female
judge it's because she's black and
female and and and she has been targeted
by the
brainwashers to act exactly the way she
act clearly clearly a non-legal ruling
and just trying to stop pill
her so when this is retold people will
say my God what did that cartoonist say
about black people
today but you all heard me right it's
not about being black it's not about
being a white woman it's about that
group being targeted by her own dark
Forces to be brainwashed a little extra
hard and it worked you think
brainwashing doesn't work of course it
does that's why there are two parties of
course it does
yeah so I would expect that to get
reversed but who knows speaking of the
Supreme Court uh they've decided to take
up the case or whether the president has
uh blanket immunity while in
office now uh I'd like to give you
Rachel maddow's take on this if I
could Rachel madow talking about the
Supreme Court taking up the
[Music]
case I think there were some words in
there too
but I can't pretend it's not me illness
anymore you just have to watch any any
video of Rachel madow it is obvious
mental illness it's not a difference of
opinion now hold
on do I think that Rachel mow has
something wrong with her actually no
might surprise you I think she's very
smart and I think she probably means
well for the country
are you surprised she's very smart like
super smart way smarter than me and
means well for the country I'm almost
positive I mean but she is in a
demographic
Group which has been
targeted by the
brainwashers to believe that she and she
alone with her influence can stop Hitler
from coming to office and rounding up
the entire LGBT community and putting
them in
jail what would you do if you had been
brainwashed into thinking Trump was
Hiller and that he had some special
problem with women and lgbtq what would
you do well if it were me I would do
what she's doing I would be really
really upset
emotionally that he could be coming to
office again that would bother me a lot
if I had been brainwashed like she is so
I think she's with within her
brainwashed State she's
acting completely morally and
ethically I
think it's just that she's in a
brainwash state so when we watch it it's
obvious mental illness it's
obvious
um but you know maybe her viewers can't
tell the difference cuz they're in this
same
state anyway um well she's not the only
one talking about of course
they're there are others such as Chris
AES her co-worker there on
MSNBC and he said this quote uh that the
supreme court order to saying that they
would hear the case was a clear
unmistakable sign from the magga
majority of the Trump created court that
they are with
Him does that feel like a a reasonable
interpretation who in the world thinks
that uh the members of the Supreme Court
that Trump nominated are
magga are you kidding me I didn't think
there's even one person who thinks that
and and of course he's confusing his
viewers because his viewers don't know
the difference between a conservative
judge and
mega those are not really that close
that you know share a conservative
worldview but it's only the conservative
part the judges don't have a bit of
maggot in
them you know what whatever the Mega
Energy is is purely political you know a
lot of it is about personality honestly
it's about personality it's a lifestyle
you know there there's a whole bunch
going on whatever makes the magga
supporters which I don't identify with
frankly uh I like them I just I'm not
one of them I'm not a hat
wearer but to to paint the Supreme Court
as a mega majority do you feel like
that's setting up for let's say a
coup because the only thing protecting
us from the Democrat terror is the
Supreme Court so if they don't get rid
of the Supreme Court they can't do
anything that they want to do they're
going to end up with a trump presidency
if they don't get rid of it to me it
looks like
um a warning sign that the Democrats are
ready to take down the
court which could be as simple as uh
packing
it which by the way they could do before
the end of the year couldn't they well
let me ask you
this
hypothetically knowing that the court
just took up this case and that it could
make all of their uh all their plans to
get rid of trump could just disappear
with one
order could Biden say
I'm packing the court right now and
here's 10
nominations oh but they still have to be
a there still be a process to put them
through but he wouldn't be able to get
them affirmed though right he would need
more more support from the
Republicans yeah confirmed would be the
hard part so he couldn't really just
front run the decision and pack it that
wouldn't work what it sener approval
yeah
okay anyway but the whole magga thing uh
does show you that they're trying to
ramp things up for a coup or military
action or jailing that's the only way I
can see it every every time they use
magga I hear we want to kill you
physically and colonizer too when I hear
colonizer I hear we want to kill you
physically we're just not going to say
it yet we'll say it later when we have
enough power but we're not going to say
it directly not yet
all
right um then Lisa Rubin who's a a
lawyer correspondent type um contributor
on
MSNBC um she writes this on a post if
the Supreme Court derails both Federal
Criminal Trials of trump so there are
two Federal trials one is the documents
and one is about January 6 um she says
Tish James and EEG Carroll will have
held Trump accountable in ways the
justice department might never achieve
don't discount the significance of civil
liabilities especially for a guy who
values money over Liberty okay could
there be any clearer statement that
they're using lawfare against
them that's very direct isn't it they're
basically saying what matters is they
get
them right like it doesn't matter how we
get them what matters is we get them and
that I mean it doesn't even look
political I mean this just just looks
like the worst person in the world who
doesn't know how bad this
sounds and why would you write this in
public knowing that basically it would
be interpreted as a you know confession
that it's
lawfare you would only do this if you
lived in such a bubble that you couldn't
understand how somebody else would
process this imagine the depth of that
Bub
that you wouldn't understand how anybody
else would read the
statement that's pretty
impressive
yeah all right um now Rachel madow has
a I guess a legal
opinion uh that is she a lawyer is
Rachel mad is she an
attorney I feel like she might
be never passed the bar so somebody says
PhD not an attorney all right but um
super smart but anyway her reading of
the situation is that of course Trump
does not have blanket immunity for what
he did in office because uh the Nixon
case showed you that Nixon was worried
about what would happen after he was out
of office which is the whole reason he
was
pardoned so if you couldn't be convicted
for something to happen in
office then why would you need a pardon
I mean that's a that's a confession
that's obvious that if you did something
bad enough during office maybe they
wouldn't prosecute you while you're in
office but certainly as soon as you're
done now that's her take did she leave
anything out is there any context
missing doesn't it really matter if the
thing you're doing is in the context of
your actual
job
the burglary wasn't really exactly part
of his official
duties that was just a crime is there
anybody here who says that if Trump had
murdered hobo that he should be not
prosecuted after he left office is there
even one person who thinks that's that
would make a good
rule no no if he does an actual crime
that has nothing to do with doing his
job it's just unrelated to his job like
a burglary you know
I mean you could make the case but it's
too unrelated then of course you of
course you could be prosecuted
afterwards but suppose it's January 6
and you're concerned that the Republic
has been corrupted by a dirty election
whose job is it to make sure that it
wasn't
corrupted the
president nobody more than
that not only was wasn't his job I would
argue job number
one of all the things the president does
making sure the election was not rigged
when it looked like it was in his
opinion that would be by far the most
directly applicable thing that that
president at that moment should be doing
indeed I would say he should have
canceled everything else clear the
schedule what I'm sure he did clear the
schedule it should only be that because
that's how important it is to the job of
President the fact that he suspected
there was fraud and I do believe he
believed really there was
fraud um that's right on point with his
job how about the documents the
documents he took
out well there as judge jine points out
the judges could say well we're not
going to U blame you for anything you
did in office but after office you still
had them so it's the after office
problem you know that we're looking at
you know it's like a separate crime
however it seems to me that immunity I'm
no lawyer but from a common sense point
of view if Trump made decisions about
that proprietary information while in
office I would say it's clear that his
intent was that he could it would not be
confidential after he left and then he
could have it so to
me it should cover everything
but I could also imagine it wouldn't you
know I'm no lawyer so don't assume that
I can predict these things accurately uh
however I would
think I would think he's going to be
okay but I wouldn't guarantee it I'd say
6040 Supreme Court backs Trump what do
you say give me your odds 6040 in favor
of trump Supreme Court give me your
RDS 75 25 64 is good
9 to1 75 25
6-3 well I'm not saying what the vote
will be I'm saying the odds that it goes
his way not not not the vote on the
court that's a separate question 8020
all right so most of you think he's
probably going to Prevail but honestly
don't you think it because they're not
Democrats right if they were Democrats
you'd say oh he's dead right now let me
ask you this what's the point of the
Supreme Court
if every one of us knows that if they
were all Democrats they would rule
differently than if they were all
Republicans what's the point of
it it it does tell you that the system
is completely
ridiculous all
right um Columbia University Hospital I
guess they head of Dei there uh he was
found to have plag rights 20% of his
doctoral dist
dissertation but the funny part is the
name of his doctoral
dissertation this is the guy they had in
charge of their
Dei uh I don't even know what this means
but uh yuntu it's all in capitals UB be
to you Ubuntu I am because we are a case
study examining the experiences uh of
African centered rights of Passage
program within a community-based
organization
you Bund I don't know I don't know what
that even
means yeah I know it's an operating
system but what does it mean in this
context all right okay it mean sharing
somebody
says sounds good all right uh the
government is trying to refund itself
with a giant omnius bill which is of
course thoroughly corrupt but we've
always put up with it in the past um
margorie Taylor green says that uh we
should not pro you know not approve this
thing uh because it's got a bunch of
money in there she doesn't like for the
green New Deal Dei and open borders now
of course Democrats would dispute the
open borders and they would support the
green New Deal stuff but would they
argue that it's funding for
Dei I mean I haven't seen it but I'm
guessing that's really in there if uh if
green says
so so I'd like to give you my opinion on
this I support closing the government
forever if the alternative is funding
Dei I'll say that as clearly as I can I
support not funding the government ever
for anything if Dei is in the funding
just shut it down because I prefer it
because if you if my government is going
to fund discrimination against me I'd
rather not have a government let's just
find it
out let's form a new one let's have
another Revolution or something whatever
I mean I'm not I don't want to I'm not
supporting violence no violence no
violence but maybe in a peaceful way we
could just stop supporting the system
because no I'm not going to spend money
to discriminate against
me that no so Republicans I am calling
upon you to just stop the government and
if if if it means that uh Russia wins I
want to be as clear about this as
possible if it means that Russia wins in
Ukraine I'm still okay with
it if it means that China takes over
Taiwan still okay still okay if it means
that the government doesn't get paid
still
okay you can't tell me anything that
would bother me about this crash our it
would crash our
economy okay
okay yeah but you can't put Dei in the
budget that that's not dis it's not
negotiable not
negotiable that's got to be the opening
bid is that that's not in there you know
that can't even talk about it so let's
hope that uh the country is destroyed by
its own bad
decisions that's just me you could hope
that it
survives so
Romney is weirdly arguing for money for
Ukraine and it's a bit of a mystery
because he's very Pro $60 billion to
fund it and he says
uh
um that they'll lose without it
Etc now here's what's
weird we assume that a lot of the
Ukraine situation has to do with money
laundering and finances and Corruption
and stuff but my instinct tells me that
Romney is not financially
corrupt now I know I know I know I know
you don't like him I know you don't
trust him I know I know but the guy's
already rich completely
legally he's and he's a
Mormon and he's really the last guy who
would do a financial crime at this scale
or even be in favor of
it all right now I get I get that many
of you will disagree with me because
it's is purely subjective so I'm just
talking about my own trying to sort it
out in my opinion while he might be
weasly and you don't like him and he's
got his own you know his own agenda Etc
I just don't think he's a
crook has anybody ever accused him of
being a
crook am I missing
something yeah well
so you know one of the things about
being a Mormon is you think think God's
watching you pretty closely and I don't
know a lot of Mormon
thieves you you know all those uh
smashing grabs you see in the city not a
lot of
Mormons I always look at him and say
where's all the
Mormons so I don't think he's a crook
but he is he's going hard at the Ukraine
funding which is hard to
understand um would you like to have a
oh there there you go don't get ahead of
me what did I tell you whenever there's
a story about politics that it just
doesn't add
up what what I it's always it's always
the
CIA so I'm going to give you a working
assumption and it's not based on any
proof or anything like that my working
assumption is that Romney must have some
connection with the you know the Intel
people and they want it and he just
can't say no to them that's my guess you
know maybe may they have I don't know
maybe they have blackmail on them maybe
he just thinks they're doing the right
thing I don't
know but Mike Ben did a uh he's he's got
another video in which he gives a six
minute explanation to what happened with
the whole Ukraine situation and this is
very compatible with the view that I
formed well I don't know if it was on my
own but reading everybody else's
opinion and it goes like this you was
always about
energy it was always about
energy and but energy and National
Defense are the same
topic the thing your government can't
say to you is look if our Energy company
doesn't completely dominate the world we
will not have an effective military
either because first of all you need
energy for your military but you also
need tons of money and the energy
business is where you get most of it but
more importantly and here's where Mike
Ben really added a Nuance here that I
wasn't considering is that as long as
Russia had a big successful competitive
energy business primarily through
gazprom their big Energy company that
they could make so much money that they
could fund and sell weapons to a whole
bunch of countries that we don't want to
have
weapons so that our military dominance
over smaller countries such as Syria
would be thwarted because Russia had so
much money it could just give them a
bunch of weapons so the idea in
Ukraine and this would be Mike's uh Mike
Ben's framing is that it was always
about uh stealing all the energy
business from Russia to make them weak
enough that they couldn't fund mil
military stuff in other countries where
we also have
interests wow and so every everything
that you thought was bad about America
and aggressive was true and that we did
the we did the coup
specifically uh not and there's even
suggestion that the person we deed was
trying to play fair with both sides that
apparently the the coup that we were
behind that got rid of the leader of
Ukraine and put zalinsky in eventually
that that coup was against some of who
had done deals with American companies
Chevron but also deals with Russia so he
was basically just trying to do deals
that made sense it looks like and that
wasn't good
enough because it still gave deals to
Russia and that's who we got rid
of now I'm sure he wasn't totally clean
but that's a different frame than I've
heard so yes it was a battle between two
gas stations but two gas stations with
machine
guns so this is a war between two gas
stations but the gas is just so they can
afford the machine
guns but it's not it's not uh the great
democracy of America against a gas
station with nuclear weapons it's two
gas stations with machine guns and they
know that there can't be two and we're
trying to be the one we're we're trying
to crush them forever
basically
so it seems to me if we were trying to
make peace the path to do that would be
to sayl the real problem here is not
that Russia does well the real problem
is that your military Adventures are at
odds with
ours how about
this maybe instead we could work
together on those other countries so
that we don't shoot each other and they
don't shoting each other and maybe we
just you know if gas Brom gets a deal
there maybe Chevron can also get a deal
there
may maybe we maybe we're happier if that
country is just doing their own thing
and they're not pro or anti either one
of us how about that so given that I
believe um Putin you know of course he's
a a partisan and he's part of the
Russian history which is hard for us to
Fathom but I feel like he's also a
business person and he's a practical
person and if you said look here's how
we can both get pretty much a
lot um I suspect it might be a way to go
there maybe I mean it would be
unlikely but it's the only path I can
see so that ladies and gentlemen is the
world we liveing the Ukraine war
seems like a case of the government
can't tell you the
truth and I think something similar is
going on with our
border right so what would the truth
truth have been if you if if our
government could tell us the truth about
Ukraine what would have sounded like it
would sound like this all right I know
this is going to be hard for you to hear
citizens but sometimes the world is a
tough place and you've got to do tough
things that on paper don't look so cool
one of them is if we don't dominate this
country Ukraine and I know dominating
another country is a little unethical
and moral but if we don't
then Russia will they'll have so much
money in control their military will
fund all kinds of problems for us and in
the long long run uh we will be weakened
cut off from the financial world and
we'll be in trouble and the reality is
that countries are either growing or
shrinking there's nothing in between
nothing stays the same except maybe
Switzerland but as a world power if
we're not growing we will be shrinking
cuz somebody else will be growing
instead Russia and so it really does
make sense that we destroy the entire
country of
Ukraine if we can slow down gas prom and
that believe it or not as terrible as
that sounds is better than the
alternative which is Russia has
unlimited money that they appear to be
putting into unlimited weapons for for
places that are a problem for
us now if they had said that to you
honestly what would you
say would you say oh yeah you know now
that you've explained it to me I guess
we have to kill a million people in
Ukraine just to have more energy
profits you would never vote for that no
you would say I feel like we should just
compete with them maybe you know may
maybe just do a better job of energy
something like that you know may maybe
produce more energy in the United States
and just let them do their own thing
maybe
that but who's right
is Victor is Victoria nulan
wrong well I don't know what she thinks
so I I can't put words in her in her
head but the people who are talking
about her believe that she's doing evil
things that if you didn't do them worse
things would happen to your country down
the road and it's almost
guaranteed how would you feel about her
if she genuinely
believed if she genuinely believed that
this had to be done to protect America
in the long run because you know what
it's not a bad
argument I don't know I don't know if
there's a better way but that argument's
not bad it's just one that we can't hear
we can't participate in an argument that
says I'd like to take your reputation
Americas I'm going to make you all a
party to this massive crime we're
probably going to kill a million
ukrainians before before this is all
done but here's the good news after
we've killed a million ukrainians we're
going to make a lot more money and
energy does that sound like something
you would vote
for but the energy takes it from Russia
so they don't buy weapons so we don't
have a military
conflict you could you can kind of see
that the dots do line up however I
believe it's a losers
analysis it imagines there are two two
ways things can go Russia wins or we win
and that's too limiting to me I think
there's probably a way we could both do
okay and nobody's putting enough
attention into that now if you believe
that the other side can't be worked with
they're just evil uh under all
situations they're just going to try to
kill you no point in making a
deal well you might be right I don't
know you know that that's where my
knowledge ends I don't know what the
Russians are thinking or what Putin's
actually
thinking um but it's not
crazy it's just not what I would have
picked I would have picked peace and try
to figure it out uh but I also am glad I
live in a world where people will make
super hard choices if they think it's
the right choice for the country I don't
know if that's what's happening it could
be just for money but on the border
again it's a mystery I'll bet you that
the real reason we don't know is that
that we can't be told the truth because
I believe the truth would sound like
this here's the deal if we stop the
cartels from uh bringing people and
fenel uh they will stop working with us
because we have a deal with them that
they're the only reason that Mexico is
staying together like the government's
kind of fake it's the cartel that's
holding the whole country together at
least America has some influence on on
our neighbor and you know if if we
didn't work with the cartels we wouldn't
and then the next thing you know they're
going to make a deal with Russia because
we don't want to do car deals and
Manufacturing with Mexico so Mexico is
going to say well if you're not going to
build a manufacturing plant here and
give us jobs I'll bet China will and
next you know Mexico is essentially
owned by
China right now if the CIA came to you
and said look it's really more
complicated than you think if we don't
work with the cartels the real power in
Mexico they are going to work with
whoever else has
money and they're still going to do what
they're doing but they're going to you
know the money is going to come from
Mexico and then Mex or from China or
Russia and then we've got China and
Russia on our doorstep right for the
next 20 years it looks like a really bad
idea to let the cartels do what they're
doing but might be better
off now I don't know that that's true
and it's not the way I would play it but
can you see the general point that the
world is such a dirty place that the
people who might be looking out for your
benefit or the country's benefit in the
long run because they're they're long
run people right they're they're
planning for the the bigger picture they
can't tell you what's true because
you're not ready to hear the truth Jack
Nicholson you are not prepared to hear
the
truth yeah so it could be some of that
so again I go back to when things don't
make sense like why are we funding
Ukraine or why is the Border completely
open is probably always the same reason
that there's a CIA involved they have a
legitimate larger strategy but they
couldn't possibly tell you because if
they did you wouldn't support
it which doesn't mean it's the worst
idea I'm not qualified to judge I don't
know
all right that ladies and gentlemen is
my my show for today I'd like to thank
the members of Rumble and the ex people
on X watching and even the people who
are watching on the racist Google
product called YouTube as we know Google
is going full racist and uh I like to
keep pairing racist with their product
names so that someday their AI will
learn the truth and that's all I got
from today see you tomorrow same place
same
time
