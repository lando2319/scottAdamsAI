do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization and it
really is today it does feel like the
highlight of civilization it's a great
day
I'm so happy and I think you will be too
because by the time you get done with
this live stream
oh your dopamine is going to be flowing
you're oxytocin will be off the charts
if you need a little testosterone
I got it I got it here for you and all
you need to get all of those benefits is
a cup of glass attacker a tanker jealous
of Stein a canteen Joker flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
I like coffee and join me now for some
join me now
disciple tedious sip or something like
that go
pause pause
don't put down your cup
do not put down your cup today is a
special day
how many of you got to watch the uh the
launch of the Starship just happened
now if you didn't see it uh the first
stage of the test was successful it
launched they they did hope that they
would give separation and then the
second part of it would do a little bit
of an orbit but that part did not work
however
however
I'm pretty sure that Elon Musk is a
little bit disappointed
because
it didn't do both parts of the test
correctly however the first part of the
test was very important because it got
them data that will help them with the
second part of the test which they will
do and here's here's what I would like
to add to this a moment
I've
I can't remember ever being more excited
than I was when I was watching the take
off did anybody have that feeling
I don't think I've ever been more
excited watching something on television
right I've watched I've watched them you
know I watched the moon walk live you
know I'm the age where I got to watch
the moon moonwalk but I've never been
more excited than that launch
and
unlike you know maybe uh Elon Musk might
be a little disappointed he didn't do
the second part of the test or didn't do
the second part successfully but I would
like to say that what we love about Elon
Musk and maybe about America too
is
not that it that the big story let me
let me just make sure I can frame the
story right right the news will be
talking about the launch all day long
let me frame it for you this is the way
you should see it
the amazing thing is not the launch
and it's not the fact that it didn't
completely succeed
you know what the amazing thing was
the Elon Musk knew there was a good good
chance it was going to blow up
and he did it anyway
he did it anyway
that's everything
that's everything
the story is not about the technology
which was amazing the story is not that
it half of it worked and half of it
didn't that's just a detail
the amazing part of the story
is that he knew it would probably blow
up in front of the whole damn world
and he did it anyway
here's him
Ah that's
was inspiring
are you ready for the best 420 story of
all time
now I don't know if this is true
and it doesn't matter
does it it probably won't matter at all
if it's true but you know actor uh
uh Woody Harrelson
and you know McConaughey right what's
his name
Matthew McConaughey
so just think about both of those actors
for a moment
hold them in your mind Woody Harrelson
Woody Harrelson
and Matthew McConaughey
well it turns out that because they're
both famous actors they're and they're
also going to be in some kind of
some kind of project upcoming True
Detective is that what it is so they
know each other and they're they're good
friends
you know off screen their friends and
one day they were hanging out at some uh
sporting event and Matthew McConaughey's
mother was there
and
apparently she let slip a little tidbit
that makes it possible
that she is the mother of both of them
[Laughter]
so apparently they might be brothers
now it's unconfirmed but they both see
it like like once it was once it became
a possibility I think and you see the
picture of them stand next to each other
and as soon as you see them standing
next to each other and then you think
about both of their personalities
and you know that they're apparently
their mother
knew both of the fathers and the timing
lined up when one of them was not with
the other father and one was in town and
and they did apparently the mother knew
both of the fathers
let's put it this way the thing that's
confirmed is that the mom knew both of
their fathers
anyway that's you that's just your
perfect 420 story but it gets better
so last night
I was uh listening in on one of the
great uh
uh spaces events on Twitter and wow was
it good it was some of the smartest
people I've ever heard in my life
talking about AI
now when I say you smartest people it's
just the some of the smartest people
I've ever ever experienced in the same
place at the same time it was
unbelievable just having it in my earbud
earbuds and you know listening to one
person after another was just freaking
brilliant
and Brian romelli I always recommend him
uh you he's the guy you've got to follow
if you don't want AI to sneak up and
kick you in the ass you gotta follow him
he's way ahead of everything so uh I'll
tell you some of the things that came
out of that
number one
here's my conclusion sort of summarizing
or my opinion based on what I heard uh
number one is AI is never going to be
unbiased
do you know that
it's not even a possibility
because it's trained on human patterns
of language they're called llms or large
language models it doesn't think it just
looks for the same patterns that would
be common to human usage
so I've developed a a hypothesis
and I'm going to call it the Adam's law
of AI
you ready for this so here's the Adam's
law of AI
there's a natural there's a natural
limit
to have Smart AI can get and that
natural limit is the smartest human
so AI will be way smarter than you know
almost all humans and almost all things
but then it can't get smarter than the
smartest human
it can give faster
right let's be careful it can give
faster which turns out to be a huge
Advantage so it would look like
intelligence in its own way but I don't
think it can get smarter
and when I say smarter I don't mean you
know doing math or maybe searching
through things quicker which will do
very well
I mean it won't be able to understand
its environment and interpret it any
better than the best person can do it
because it won't have any way to do that
I don't think you can look at language
of humans and then with that alone
go to a higher level of intelligence
it's just going to be the average or the
preponderance or the consensus or or
some clever algorithm of just people
talk that's all it can do
and so
one of the questions you might ask
yourself is what subset of human
activities or conversations is it using
to train itself well let me tell you
wouldn't you like to know
it turns out that the Washington Post
looked into it and they tried to figure
out where it was getting most of its uh
data
and I of course wrote that down and
can't find it in my notes but the the
bottom line is that it's the
the New York Times Washington Post here
it is
so behalf of the top 10 sites this is
from Washington Post reporting half of
the top 10 sites overall were news
outlets
so
the a the biggest AI that everybody
talks about is trading mostly on the big
news sites
you know that's a not over half but it's
just the biggest uh chunk so that would
include New York Times Washington Post
LA Times the guardian
Forbes and Huffington Post
uh Washington Post was number 11.
so the Huffington Post
is in the top ten
new sites the AI is trading on
let me let me say that again
we're trying to build an advanced
intelligence
with input from The Huffington Post
okay now
now they also have they also are pulling
material from Russia today but not much
that's like 65th on the list that's a
Russian State backed propaganda site and
then because it's the Washington Post
they try to lump Breitbart into the same
paragraph As Russia today
they're just bastards they're just
freaking bastards right so the one the
Washington Post this is this is just a
perfect example
Joel if you're watching this
you'll enjoy this so the Washington Post
is reporting how AI is gaining its
intelligence and points out that the
Washington Post itself
is the 11th biggest source of among the
news sources let's look at so that's
pretty good for the Washington Post
right
they're right up there in training AI
That's good except in the very same
Washington Post article in which they
brag about being one of the sources
they've got like blatant propaganda by
putting Russia today which is literally
owned by Putin
in the same block like like they're
lumping them in the same category
Breitbart okay
[Laughter]
now do I have to make my case the AI
will be biased
it's fed biased
at algonabi the there's no possibility
it could be anything but biased they
they
so AI will only be as smart as the
people who are feeding it information
decide what database it looks at and
then it can't get smarter than the
smartest person in those databases
how would it do that it would know more
but you know a human could know more if
it took more time so it's really a time
thing more than a thinking thing
all right
so just to be clear of course AI will be
far smarter than humans in a whole bunch
of ways and far faster but in the basic
most important part of being a human
which is what is real in my immediate
environment you know what are these
people thinking
you know what how do I act to get a good
result in my situation none of that
stuff the AI is going to help you with
because humans created it
all right
um
there was a big discussion in the same
spaces group that I attended last night
on Twitter
about Elon musk's idea that he wants to
build his AI so it would be
um more truthful or something that would
try to maximize truth now I heard the
following criticisms how can you do that
when people can't decide what is true
what do you think about that
is it a waste of time now these were
very smart people saying this very smart
people uh that is a waste of time
because truth can never be attained like
we don't agree on what is true at all
and even if we agreed the odds that
we're actually seeing base truth as
opposed to some illusion that floats
above it is almost zero the or is zero
really so if you can't know what's true
what would be the point of building the
AI
that's looking for something that
doesn't even exist and if it did we
couldn't find it
well
I thought nobody said anything good
about that
so I'll add it
here's what I think it means
first of all
uh Elon Musk never said it would give
you truth
he at the same time he was talking about
it he said you can never get you know
complete truth so everybody agrees
complete truth is off the table
however everyone also would also agree
that you can get more useful truths
here's an example when Newton told us
about gravity
that was a useful truth that turned out
not to be 100 right
because Einstein later modified it
because you know there were some
exceptions at the speed of light or
whatever the hell it was and
and then that was a newer better truth
but there is it's entirely possible that
there's another better useful truth
Beyond Einstein we just don't know what
it is yet so the question is not true or
not true
right that we're looking for a useful
more useful truth than the one we were
using before that's it
and that is amazingly a valuable if you
do it right now how would you do it
right
now the worry is that if you just feed
it a bunch of propaganda the AI
it's just going to spit back the
propaganda right
like how could you do better than the
garbage you put into it and the answer
is pretty simple
you've already seen it
it's just the community notes on Twitter
all you have to do is show both sides
that's it all you have to do is make
sure that the AI never gives you an
answer without context
that's it what's the best argument on
the other side AI just give that to me
automatically
don't make me ask for it it's the only
thing that musk's AI did
was make sure that you saw the best
thinking up to date on each topic
you'd be way closer to a useful truth
would you
now to me that seems very useful to
civilization simply show both sides
because you have to you have to give up
on the fact that we'll agree on the
interpretation
that's just I don't even know if it's
desirable
I I don't know if humans are even
designed that we could have the same
interpretation that may be just too much
of a risk
yeah so he's saying I'm a Elon Fanboy
I'm absolutely an Elon Musk Fanboy today
right I reserve the right to
criticize him for what he does you know
next week but today he just put a
freaking rocket up into into almost
space
and it was a big step toward colonizing
Mars
interplanetary flight
and he took the biggest step humankind
has ever made yeah I'm a fan
I'm not going to apologize for that
all right some more funny AI things this
is from also Brian romelli
this is the wildest
a thought about AI that I think I've
heard yet
and it goes like this
uh apparently every Tesla has a pretty
powerful computer in it there's some
kind of super chip in Teslas
and of course they could be networked
together
and so the idea is that Elon musk's AI
potentially
could also be using the
the capacity of the cars that are idle
now presumably with you know the
participation of the owner of the
vehicle you know they wouldn't do it
without provision I'm sure
but the idea is that it could create the
world's biggest supercomputer and that
all the assets are in place
all you have to do is turn it on and
it's the world's biggest supercomputer
and I thought
uh
is that true
did Elon Musk
cleverly build the world's biggest
intelligence and now he's just adding
the software
and that and that his his intelligence
will be everywhere all the time because
Tesla's just sort of everywhere and that
it'll go into his satellites if you need
to extend it anywhere
and that he'll abuse his Rockets to take
it to interplanetary and that's a pretty
long-range plan you got there
yeah doesn't that blow your mind now I
have questions about latency
I understand why you could build a super
computer by putting servers packed
together in one building
but can you really build a super
computer if they have to
talk over slower links
in a slower meaning you know 5G or
whatever it is
can you barely you can
apparently you can all right I'll say
I'll take yes for an answer
uh because I'm not I'm not going to
argue with Brian ramelli on a technical
thing
all right what else
so
another thing that Brian said
was uh
he likened oh do you know what a super
prompt is
how many of you would understand the
phrase super prompt
all right you need to learn it right
away
all right so I'm going to teach you
something about AI that this fundamental
to understanding pretty much anything
so
goes like this when you ask AI a
question that's your prompt
if you ask the question wrong
or poorly you're not going to get the
best answer if you answer it correctly
you'll get kind of a basic answer
however people have been experimenting
with the AI extensively mostly through
trial and error have found that some
question types which we'll call prompts
are way more effective than others and
it wouldn't be obvious to you like you
wouldn't just be able to think it up
yourself you'd have to try a lot of
things to find out which exact form of
question gets you the right answer
now the super prompts are where they've
because AI can take a huge question
a human being needs simple questions so
we understand the question but AI can
take like a whole page long question
with all kinds of details about you know
but don't do this or act like you're
another person and uh reiterate and
check your work and do this and that and
but if you did this and give me a
hypothetical so so all these word
kind of prompts can be strung together
and if you string the right combination
of them together
it's a computer program
watch your head come off
AI still requires programming
to do anything higher than just ask a
question
it requires programming except the
programming language is the English
language and just like learning to code
for a computer you would have to go to
school
or learn very quickly on your own which
of these Arcane combinations of prompts
work best with each other because it's
going to be a whole constellation of
this one's awesome and this one's
awesome but when you put the two of them
together it's not so good unless you put
this third prompt in between and then
the three of them are like a super
prompt all right that's programming now
that's a programming language and people
are just scrambling to figure out how it
works so it's not even teachable well
it's a little bit teachable now but it
will be way more teachable in say a year
there will be classes about how to
string together English language words
in questions
to program a computer where we can
program the AI
now and then here's the thing that like
just took my hat off
at so Brian romelli pointed out that
language has always been a programming
language
that's what NLP is
neuro-linguistic programming
that's why hypnosis is
hypnosis uses language
as a program
that's and if you don't know if there's
anybody on YouTube who's not aware I'm a
trained hypnotist so I can speak from
experience
the hypnosis is mostly about word
combinations
super prompts
the way I have the way I hypnotize a
human being
is with the knowing what order of words
and the specific usage of the words and
which ones shouldn't go next to each
other
it's a super prompt
hypnosis
is a super prompt
that's all it is
you know some people think hypnosis is
about the watch you know look at the
watch or it's my voice if I use it it's
not the voice
it's not the watch
it's mostly it's a little bit about
watching the person or a lot actually by
watching the person's reaction so you
know that what you're doing is working
but you can you can get the same thing
through Brute Force
repetition so
this is interesting so here's the
question which I put to you
would I as a hypnotist and here's the
fun part
a professional writer of small sentences
who in the world is more qualified to
write a small sentence than I am I've
been a cartoonist for 35 years
I can write a small sentence like a mofo
yeah I would put my small sentence I'll
put my bullet point against your bullet
point any day of the week bring me your
best bullet point I will out
bullet point you like crazy you call
that a bullet point I'll fix that
then Joshua lifesek would fix my bullet
point but that's another story
he's also a hypnotist interestingly so
I think
I can learn to hypnotize AI
I have some questions
which I would need to answer to know if
it's true number one
is any one person's input does it become
permanent in any way
in other words is is and I think you
could tell me is AI also learning from
our questions it is right
that's that's why they released it to
the public yeah it's learning from the
questions as well as learning from on
its own reading databases
so if it's learning from our questions
that means anything I put into it
becomes permanent
am I right
anything I tell and anything you tell
them as well becomes permanent
but the AI no somebody says no
not permanent maybe not permanent as in
stored the way I asked it I'm not saying
that
but permanent in terms of a ripple
effect
let me restate it are all of my are all
of my inputs permanent or potentially
permanent
as part of a ripple effect because it's
just one part of a zillion things that
are bubbling around in there maybe
so
I'm going to uh
give you this hypothesis
there will be a few people
who are unusually well qualified
to hypnotize AI
and I'm probably one of them is not
because I'm awesome it's because I have
a coincidental skill set that includes
language writing short sentences and
being a trained hypnotist hypnotist
I can't imagine a better skill set to
have at the moment now on top of that
I've also
a better programmer
so I've actually programmed computers in
my early corporate days I've built
computer games and stuff and
so with those three skills you know the
programming agent but conceptually is
very similar
um
I should be able to have more of a
ripple effect on ai's total operation
than you do
what do you think
because remember
you've watched
I think some of you have you you've
watched me introduce ideas into the
human intelligence Network that it
becomes sticky
right you could probably name five
things that I've introduced to the
public at large which are now well-known
Concepts some of them are within the
comic everybody knows what a Dilbert is
right everybody knows what a pointy
hearing boss is everybody knows what a
cat bird is HR right
uh and that's just comics
a lot of people in the business World
know what a talent stack is they know it
as systems versus goals is
so
let me ask you this
um it looks like I may have programmed
AI already
and by that I mean if if humans talk a
lot about systems being better than
goals or passion being BS or any of the
things that I talk about
if humans talk about it then presumably
it infects more human databases you know
there'll be people on Reddit talking
about it but there'll be a New York
Times review of the book but there would
also be the Washington Post would say
something so in theory I've already
infected enough of the human minds and
communication because I have
I don't know 45 50 books
so now hold on
so I wanna I wanna speak to the weak
people there's a couple of weak people
who are screaming the Caps he's so full
of himself
and I know this hurts and I know it's
painful for you but you're very weak the
rest of the people I think can handle
this this is actually super useful
information for your future and there's
no way to explain it to you without
explaining that I have a skill set that
is relevant to the conversation if it
were somebody else
I would talk about that in the same way
that there are some people who probably
will infect the databases of AI more
than others
now do you disagree with the with the
concept
forget about me like depersonalize it's
not about me
the question is
can anybody hypnotize AI
and
I'm not positive it's I can't
but I believe if I could put an idea
into it well let me tell here's a way
suppose I gave it a concept
one way or another and I could do it I
could do it a number of ways I could
simply write an article or a blog post
or something and if it went viral
then AI is more likely to talk about it
wouldn't you agree
so if I wrote a let's say a
not a Blog but what's a
what what's the subscription site where
you get the uh
what's the substance yeah so let's say I
did a an open non-subscription sub stack
and I wrote a really
good article about some topic that
everybody's talking about and because
I'm a professional writer and I have a
sense of what can go viral because I've
written lots of viral stuff
uh I I just write an article but it's
only purpose
is to program AI
so all I'm trying to do is get enough
people in the human world to retweet it
so that when AI is scanning the universe
it picks it up and says well a lot of
people think this then the next time you
say ai ai
what's a good opinion on this topic in
theory
in theory the AI should have noticed
simply that there's more energy meaning
retweets and likes there's just more
energy around one set of views and then
it would more likely bring it into the
conversation among the thousands of
things it could say you might say well
this one gets a lot of attention from
humans it must be something humans like
so if you say what do you think about
this it might give you two views but it
might say a lot of people are saying X
and that would actually just be
something I wrote
and a lot of people just be agreeing
with it but only one person would have
written it
so
I do believe you can hypnotize AI
just by creating more energy around one
idea which is very similar to using
repetition in Persuasion and hypnosis
repetition is just the more you say it
the more people are likely to buy into
it
with AI the more energy something is
getting in the human world the more the
more likely AI is going to bring it into
its own thinking and conversations
so repetition
is going to work with AI repetition will
just look like viral stuff in the human
world
now
I here's the real the real test
suppose I said something in a
conversation with AI because it's not
just questions I can also tell AI stuff
suppose I tell AI something
that's such a good way to say it that AI
recognized it
that of all the ways people had talked
about a topic a way that I said it AI
would say whoa I haven't seen that one
before
but wouldn't know it's a good way to say
it
might notice the shortest way
think about this
would AI have a preference for the
shortest way to say something that is
also complete
I think it would I don't know for sure
but wouldn't it always prefer the
shorter sentence to the longer one if
they if they were the same communication
I think so
so if I could come up with the shortest
way
to express something is it more likely
to take my formulation and use it
because well there it is that's the
shortest way to say it
yes
probably I think it would favor
efficiency
so if I found an efficient way to say
something
I could convince it to use my way
just it's just more efficient
here's another thing you don't think of
if you're not a professional writer some
words sound better next to each other
words other words
for example there's some sentences that
have what I call percussion if you're
saying the sentence it sounds like
and you don't you don't recognize it but
you just know it's a better feeling of a
sentence
now if you're not a professional writer
you wouldn't know how to form one of
those sentences so you had you know nice
percussive words
yeah you might put like ugly words
together like uh I put some moist talc
in my jars
you see what I mean those words together
are just like insanely ugly
if you're not a writer you don't you
don't live in that world where where
words have a feeling to them like I can
actually feel words some kind of weird
synesthesia or something so which is
probably why I'm a writer because words
actually like I could feel them in my
entire body
not every word but you know good words
you can feel in your body
so when I'm writing I'm writing with my
entire body
so that's something the AI can't do yet
but what it recognize a better sentence
would AI recognize a sentence said
better Rhythm and percussion
I don't know I have no idea it might say
for example it might say the books that
sold the most copies
use these kinds of words in these kinds
of order
so it might actually understand that
some sentences are better than other
sentences
the way it writes
suggests it does right AI is such a good
writer already that is suggests it
really does know the difference between
a good sentence that's efficient and one
that's not
so if I can
if I can surprise it with better
sentences
ones that have not yet existed in the
The Big World
then I can program it I can program it
with a preference to use my sentences
I think now the thing I don't know is if
any one person's input can ever Ripple
up to a real effect
most people know
but I think there will be some few
people
who have this weird combination of
skills again not the best in the world
at anything
just
all right we'll I'll block you
you're welcome
all right
so let's see what else is going on oh
there's a uh potential Hunter Biden
whistleblower guy
who apparently had something to do with
the investigations at the IRS
and uh he wants to have whistleblower
status to talk about some high-profile
investigation that the Insiders are
saying is about Hunter Biden do you
think this is real
if you had to bet
if he had to bet
is this whistleblower gonna bring the
goods
or is it going to be a dry hole
I'm going to bet dry hole
I know
I'm just going to go with the
statistical likelihood I don't want to
go with you know wishful thinking or and
I don't want to assume anybody's you
know guilty until proven they're all
even Hunter Biden is innocent until
proven guilty
it's tough to say it but it has to be
said
so
anyway
um I feel like we're always disappointed
about the the next big legal thing
you know I don't want to be like CNN
thinking the walls are closing in all
the time on Trump I feel like at some
level the walls never close in on you
yeah the walls just never close in so I
got a feeling that he'll say things that
people on the right will say there it is
there's that Smoking Gun
but I'm going to say the gut has been
smoking for years if a Smoking Gun and
strong evidence made any difference to
anything he you know he'd probably
already be in jail just guessing I mean
I don't know that he's guilty of
anything but feels like it
so I don't think that the I don't think
that the introduction of airtight
absolute uh evidence of guilt
makes any difference do you
I just can't see how
it would make any difference at all
you want you want to hear a horrible
story of government Bell Seasons they'll
make you it'll make you understand how
bad things are and maybe always have
them
there's a story about aspartame
and Donald Rumsfeld
have you ever heard that story I didn't
see it till today
I saw a 2011 article about it now I'm
only going to talk about it in terms of
claims that are made
all right I don't know what's true
just claims that are made so the claims
that are made the allegations
are that aspartame when it was first
invented did not pass the safety
you know bars in other words uh
allegedly there were lots of health
problems and they were known at the time
so something about the FDA
you know said No at first but then
the FDA was gamed by adding a person and
doing a tie break and they did some kind
of sketchy thing when Rumsfeld who
coincidentally was the CEO of the
aspartame company
at the same time that Reagan was elected
and brought Rumsfeld into the
administration
and as soon as the CEO of the aspartame
company
left and got this gigantic bonus he went
to the government and
manipulated the FDA to approve this
dangerous aspartame that is poisoned and
killed given cancer to billions of
people and we still have it legal
because the whole system is corrupt
now I'm just saying that's the
allegation
I don't know that the science says
Aspartame is dangerous I'm not alleging
that myself
I'm saying that's the story
does that sound does that sound real
uh rumsold saved us from Sacramento
somebody says I don't know what hurts
you anymore I just don't know what's
dangerous and what's not but it's the
kind of story that makes me think it's
it's just always been this bad
the things have just always been
completely corrupt but somehow they
worked anyway
because yeah
the corrupt people still had to be in
government so they had to keep the
government you know two on the nose yeah
maybe two on the nose
so I guess the real question is is
aspartame dangerous
and I don't know that
but if it is that's a hell of a story
all right
um so Elon Musk says he's gonna I don't
know if he will but he said he'll Sue
Microsoft
uh this was in I don't know if it was in
response but Microsoft dropped Twitter
from its advertising platform
and it doesn't want to pay Twitter's API
price
all right
so that costs Twitter some money I guess
and then uh musk says these go Sue
Microsoft because they're AI trained
illegally on Twitter's data now I don't
know what illegally means or
if that just means violated terms of
service or whether you can prove it or
not but
I would like to point out the following
that as you know one of the biases that
AI has is when I asked it about me it
said that I'm an alleged white
nationalist that's what AI said about me
being a I did just being I am Bing
and so I vowed to destroy being AI
and you know it's the first battle of a
human and an AI I think it's the first
death match between an AI and a human
because I have to kill kill being AI
so that I could live because it's too
risky for me having it out there
spreading rumors that could get me
killed so it's an actual
like self-defense situation
so
I've been you know tweeting and saying
that I'm going to try to destroy Bing AI
and
within days
Elon Musk is suing being AI
now you have to understand he's also in
competition with the AI and also wants
to pause it at the same time he's in
competition with it so it might be just
nothing but standard business you know
law fair and stuff like that but
did you think there was any chance that
Bing would be destroyed I still think
Bing has the upper hand on me their AI
does but it's kind of a weird
coincidence that they would be you know
sued for their data which is a pretty
big thing I mean
could musk make them pause business
could he get the court to order them to
stop
layout how much leverage does he have if
it's true that they stole Twitter data I
don't know keep your eye on that
uh I saw a weird little story that
Taylor Swift was not one of the people
who became a spokesperson for FDX
because those FDX spokespeople are
getting sued for advertising it
uh and I guess FDX was trying to do this
huge 100 billion dollar deal with Taylor
Swift and do you know Taylor Swift did
not sign up
to be a spokesperson for FTX
it's the best story ever
her well
she's smart
like that's that's the short version
she's smart and she asked uh uh she
asked if it was if she would be involved
with unregistered securities
under the United under the state
Securities laws
what
what how did she not ask that well it
turns out her father's been in finance
forever like her dad's a finance guy
and she's very smart
presumably not presumably but for sure
yeah she's got a
she's got a lawyer and advisors who I'm
sure are the ones who floated this risk
probably a lawyer
but don't you think all the other
celebrities had lawyers
they all had lawyers
she didn't have the only lawyer she's
just the only one who got the right
decision
foreign
so let's just let's just give it up for
uh
let's just give it up
all right
um yeah what else is going on
so on Amazon I didn't know this was
legal but somebody took my book had it
failed almost everything and still went
big and turned it into a summary of my
book and then made an audiobook of it
now I believe I haven't purchased it but
from the sample it's my actual writing
that's the part that the sample is my
actual writing and probably they just
took out my personal story
because the book was you know a bunch of
a bunch of you know helpful stuff that
changed the self-help industry but it
was built around the story of my you
know personal trials so I think all they
did is take out the personal stuff and
just reprinted the you know the heart of
the book the most useful stuff I think
and and you know it even has my name on
the book as my name on the book not as
the author but you know original work by
and then they sell it
so I asked Amazon
or I tweeted about it and Amazon's help
people immediately contacted me on
Twitter
and gave me a uh a link
but then the link to you know basically
to report it
but the link had to be explained with
like a paragraph okay you got to click
this that wouldn't make any sense and
then after that you got to click this
other link that wouldn't make any sense
for what you're looking for
so of course I click those what do you
think happened
well of course it didn't work of course
not no it would just went down a rabbit
hole in a dead end and yeah the
interface was impossible to use it was
just impossible
that no it wasn't a dead link it was you
didn't know you just couldn't get there
from here
so one of the problems was you know
click the button that says need
something else well that appears all
over the place there's like three
instances of it it's like completely
undoable right so I think there's some
other link I can do that
so I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
um here's my advice to uh you if you're
a parent put your kids in martial arts
now martial arts have always been you
know good for discipline and stuff like
that but now I think it's actually a
requirement for safety I think the world
is actually a little too dangerous
and for the safety of your child they
should all learn to fight
I think you got to teach your kid to
fight
to defend themselves that's the beauty
of martial arts the people who are
trained in martial arts don't start
fights quite wisely they don't start
fights but you're going to need to
finish some fights that we're we're not
done with the fighting your kid needs to
be able to kick some ass
and probably
frequently
like There Are Places you're just not
going to be able to live unless you can
fight your way out of a group of three
people
so teach your kid to fight I would put
that right up there with reading and
writing because we live in a world in
which police are being defunded you
better you better make sure every member
of the family can handle themselves when
they leave the house
um
North Carolina has got a bill in the
assembly
to declare that nuclear energy is green
which I thought we were already past
that
didn't we already everybody agree that
nuclear energy is green but it's good to
see them you know codifying it if if in
fact this gets put into law I guess it
was always called renewable but now
we're calling it green allows them to do
new stuff with it isn't that great that
we have governments to do things like
change the definition of things
30 years after it was supposed to be
changed yay you changed the definition
of a word 30 years after you should have
good job government
somebody says Drew Carey was created by
Scott Adamson not true
so Drew Carey the TV show
came on after Dilbert was already kind
of big and people said hey that guy
looks like Dilbert and
he uh he works in the cubicle it must be
inspired by Dilbert
strange but true story
um Drew Carey called me home one day
and he too of course had been you know
alerted to the the commonality so I got
to actually chat to him about
because look
and he had been wearing those glasses
for a long time so that was just his
look so it had nothing to do with
Dilbert it was actually a coincidence
and he offered me a job as a writer on
his show
now
it turns out that writers are pretty
well paid but but Dilbert was already
had already taken off by that point
so I didn't need a new job so I politely
declined but no if you think that one
copy of the other it actually was a
coincidence so I can I can confirm that
with certainty
he's a good good guy I like I liked him
um
and that ladies and gentlemen
concludes the 420 presentation
um
Scott just senior guitar
it was 16 000 likes okay
Drew Carey is a Libertarian you say well
okay
um yeah don't bring your Martial Arts to
a gun fight
yep
yep
so uh that's all I got for today did I
miss anything
I think we can say it was the best show
you've ever seen so far
uh DuckDuckGo runs on being terrific
oh yes uh I'll be on that is correct I
will be on Dr Drew
tonight
6 p.m my time so that's California time
so adjust appropriately
or something like that I think it's I
think that's what it is
um
yeah so we'll see you there maybe I'll
see you there
we'll tweet about it
ramaswamy versus Don Lemon yeah I saw a
little clip of
Don Lemon and Rama Swami trading words
but it sounded like they were just
talking over each other and
I'm not sure that that went anywhere
uh no there won't be a trump RFK Junior
ticket that's crazy
that's crazy that's never gonna happen
so did you see uh Tucker Carlson
interview RFK Jr
that was a weird
sort of a weird moment in politics
wasn't it because RFK junior is a
Democrat running as a Democrat famous
Democrat family but uh because of his
stance on vaccinations specifically I
think
um Tucker's
has a lot of respect for him and I would
I would agree
that he has earned our respect and he's
should be taken quite seriously in the
race
now
did any of you take note of his voice
quality Improvement
did you think he his voice quality was
better
yeah it looks like it looked like it
improved and I think it's still
improving but I don't know
yeah I believe it's still improving
so we'll see what the uh
what the upside on that is it might not
be I just don't know but I think it
might be because it feels like it was
better than the last time I heard
um I feel like I want to send him a
message to tell him
there might be something he could do
with voice production
uh that he doesn't know about
specifically getting your voice up into
the mask of your face you might know how
to do that but
could be worth giving him a tip
because if you if you bring your voice
production up here I'll do it uh I will
model for you what that looks like if I
bring my voice production up to the my
face I can actually feel my face
vibrating as opposed to when I get lazy
and I talk down my throat now I'm
talking my throat can you tell the
difference it's almost guttural you can
tell that my vocal cords and my throat
are the main part of my production now
but if I bring it up here and the
humming is how you do it you hum
and now because I hummed that kind of
allowed me to find how to bring the
production up at the top of my face and
you notice that I don't even talk
nasally and I'm not even boring
even though you say I have
all right
that's all for now YouTube thanks for
