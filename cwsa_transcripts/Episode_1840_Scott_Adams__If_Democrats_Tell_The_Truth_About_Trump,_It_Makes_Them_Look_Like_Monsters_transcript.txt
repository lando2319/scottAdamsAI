good morning everybody
and welcome to coffee with Scott Adams
the highlight of your day
probably the best thing that's ever
happened to you
would you like to take it up a notch
would you yeah yeah I think you would
and all you need to do that is a cup of
mug or a glass of tanker jealous or
style the canteen sugar flask a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
have I mentioned I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day
thing makes everything better it's
called simultaneous happens now go
ah so far so good what do you say
I think we're off to a great start
and uh what do you think's happening uh
with the midterms so it looks like the
latest is that according to Rasmussen
the Republicans are up by Five Points a
generic Republican versus a generic
Democrat with 81 days to go
do you think that will narrow
do you think that will narrow
I believe it will by the time we get to
the election there probably won't be
much of a gap there at all
because everybody just retreats to their
team
always does yeah always does
so it turns out that DeSantis is not
going to get away with his stop woke Act
which
restricts colleges and universities from
discussions of race and gender
so do you know what's wrong with
restricting uh
freedom of speech and
colleges
now why did nobody see this coming
how can the government restrict free
speech in college and get away with it
they can't apparently apparently it's
the most obviously you can't do
so while uh DeSantis had been on this
long-winning streak of doing the obvious
right thing to do for his base in any
situation this feels like a
this feels like an error doesn't it
you're saying the colleges colleges can
right yeah a private a private
institution can but the government can't
tell a college what to do in terms of
freedom of speech
so there's no way that the government
can get away with telling you what you
can and cannot do right in terms of
speech
they can certainly change what they fund
if there's any funding element to it
well we'll see what happens there but uh
looks like colleges will get to say
whatever they want
um let's talk about the Sam Harris
situation
again because there's an update
so as you know
famous rational
person Sam Harris
um
some people who think he destroyed his
career
by noting that he was happy that Hunter
Biden's laptop was suppressed by the
left
as a conspiracy basically and that it
probably made a difference in the
election and he thought that that was
fine
because the uh there had been similar
you know laptop related things Hillary's
what's Weiner's laptop you know was a
factor in the first election with Trump
versus Hillary and so Sam Harris was
saying well if Trump lost because of a
laptop thing
but maybe he also won because of a
laptop thing it's not the biggest thing
in the world and it's probably Fair
because uh in Sam Harris's View
Trump is so dangerous
that gaming the system a little bit was
um probably appropriate in terms of
specifically in terms of that laptop
thing
of course people got on him and said to
him
um does that mean that you would justify
the election being rigged
which is the obvious next question right
and so he wanted to uh to tell us that
he did not think that so here's uh
here's his full answer
he said there's a podcast clip now
here's what you should listen for
I want you to listen for the specificity
of his answer
it's a little too specific
all right but wait for us see if you
catch it so it's a it's a multi-part
tweet
uh he said uh this there's a podcast
clip circulating that seems to be
confusing many people about my views on
Trump which is understandable because I
wasn't speaking very clearly
so for what is worth here's what I was
trying to say
all right so now I
I'm a proponent of forgetting what he
said before
if a clarification is being offered
so forget about what he did say
he's got 48 Hours according to my 48
hour rule that I made up to clarify and
if he does try to clarify you should
just take the clarification
don't don't try to be somebody up about
what they said if they've already
clarified all right so I'm on board with
him so far let's look at the
clarification and sort of ignore what he
said before I like that as a standard
even if you think maybe it causes people
to lie or backtrack or weasel or
whatever but I think we should just keep
that as a social standard if somebody
clarifies just take the clarification
all right so he goes on
he said I was essentially arguing for a
principle of self-defense interesting so
the idea here is that Trump is dangerous
and therefore our citizens would have a
right of self-defense and then he goes
on where there's a Continuum of
proportionate Force that is appropriate
and necessary to use so again I think
he's going back to if the weeder laptop
made a difference in one election
maybe the Biden laptop makes a
difference in the other direction and
that those would be roughly equivalent I
think that's the argument
I've always viewed Trump as a very
dangerous person to elect as president
of a fake University talking about Trump
University let alone the U.S
and when he became a sitting president
who would not commit to a peaceful
transfer of power I viewed him as more
dangerous still
however I have never been been under any
illusion that he is orange Hitler
what
so here he's saying that he's not under
the illusion that he's orange Hitler
which is interesting because when I
talked to him on a show he did he did
allude
you did make a Hitler Hitler analogy
with Trump so I guess the Hitler
analogies are not to be taken seriously
okay
um so he doesn't compare Trump to Orange
Hitler
and then on the podcast he goes on I was
speaking narrowly about the wisdom and
propriety of ignoring the hunter Biden
laptop story until the election
I've always thought that was a very hard
call ethically and journalistically
but given what happened with the Anthony
Weiner laptop in the previous election I
think it was probably the right call
now here's the part you want to look for
the specificity all right look what he
says
and then what he doesn't say
right
so watch for what he doesn't say this is
the important part
he goes on nothing I said on that
podcast was meant to suggest that the
Democrats would have been right to
commit election fraud
talking about 2020. or take other
illegal measures to deny Trump the
presidency nor do I think they did that
all right so what are you saying is that
he didn't mean to suggest
that Democrats would have been right to
commit fraud he didn't mean to suggest
it
does that mean he doesn't think it
because that's different right
it's one thing was one thing to say I
didn't mean to suggest it which is an
interesting way to say it
how about I didn't mean to say it
but you know what I do say is this if it
was confusing I change it
but interesting he didn't mean to
suggest it
doesn't really give his opinion about it
does it I didn't mean to suggest it is
very different from that wasn't my
opinion
am I wrong
I feel like when you say I didn't mean
to suggest it it means I didn't mean to
say it it doesn't mean he doesn't think
it and we don't know what he thinks
right I'm not I'm not putting a thought
into his mind there with my imagination
I'm just saying that he didn't specify
um
that it wasn't his opinion
he simply specified he didn't mean to
suggest it
slightly different you can imagine them
being the same
or you can imagine that he meant them to
be the same
but they don't sound exactly the same do
they sound a little different
and he and he says nor do I think that
they did that now whether he thinks they
did that or not is irrelevant to whether
they did that or not but
um didn't mean to suggest that it would
have been right to commit election fraud
or other illegal means didn't mean to
suggest it
it feels like
we still don't know if he thinks it
would have been a good idea
like why not tell us directly because
here's the thing if it's not a good idea
to rig an election to keep Trump out of
office why isn't it
why isn't it a good idea if you believe
what you say about his Danger
it would definitely be a good idea I
would do it if I believed what they
believed I would rig the election
would you
would you if you were keeping a monster
out of the office or yeah I think he
actually compared Trump to an asteroid
barreling toward the Earth
because if you you imagine let's say you
imagine from the left point of view
if Climate Change is Gonna you know
destroy the the world in some some
fashion and you think Trump's going to
make climate change worse
it's kind of like an asteroid coming
toward Earth
all right and somebody says that if you
break the law
they'll do it to you what about that
argument if you cheated on the election
they'll do it to you
um how does that deal with the fact that
everybody who can get away with it
doesn't already
I mean we live in a world where
everybody who can get away with stuff
does it
it's just whether they think they can
get away with it that's the only thing
that limits people in the real world
that's it
if they thought they could get away with
it pretty much everybody would do it
pretty much now you think you're the
exception okay I get it you're the
exception and people in your family are
awesome now people people do what they
can get away with that's the world you
live in
now getting away with it includes God
watching you right
right if you if you're a religious
person you believe God will judge you
so that might not be getting away with
it in your in your own point of view
that would not be getting away with it
because you're being watched by God
but if you didn't believe God was
watching and you didn't believe anybody
else was watching and you didn't think
there was any chance of getting caught
you would all rig the election
I know you think I'm wrong
but I'll give you my opinion it's just
an opinion I can't prove it so it's just
a just my view of the world a hundred
percent of the world would rig the
election if they thought they were
saving the world
if they thought they were saving the
world a hundred percent would rig the
election if they thought they could get
away with it nobody was watching no God
was watching
your conscience well you conscience I
guess you still have that
yeah now I I accept that you don't agree
with me
I accept that you don't agree
but I'm positive
I'm positive in my opinion very rarely
am I this sure about an opinion but I'm
positive about this one now you could
say there would be some exception right
you know if you took a million people
yeah you could get somebody to not do it
definitely but the the ordinary person
would save the world if there was no
risk
that's what I'm saying now the ordinary
person might not destroy the world for
their own benefit
that's true
yeah I can see that they wouldn't
destroy the world just to get a little
extra gain some would
some wouldn't but everyone
would break the rule to save the world
if they thought that's what was
happening everybody would
the the exceptions would be so rare that
you wouldn't even discuss them it would
be crazy people stuff like that
so I want to see if I can get somebody
to say say right here in the comments
under this scenario
that you wouldn't break the rule because
you know the rules of the rules and the
rules-based people
but you wouldn't break tell me you
wouldn't break the rule even if you
thought it was the end of the world
it's the end of the world if unless you
break the rule would you break the rule
how many would break the rule to prevent
the end of the world
you would not so there are people on
here who would not would not break a
rule
made by humans
and they would let all the humans die
you would let all the there are people
who actually saying that on the locals
platform yeah and and people are
confirming yep people are saying yes
they would let the entire world die
because following the rule is more
important
you're actually saying that right I'm
not misinterpreting you right
yeah
yeah there's so there are actually a
number of people who would destroy the
world
to uh to protect themselves
because that's what that is yeah if what
you're doing is is not breaking the rule
because you can't break the rule that's
really protecting yourself at the
expense of the entire planet and there
are people saying they would do that
they would protect their own
feeling about you know being a protector
of rules more importantly that all of
the people who have ever who are alive
all seven billion of them
yeah
now am I supposed to take you seriously
how can I take that seriously
because you're you're either lying or
you're so stupid that you wouldn't be
able to log on and have an account
I mean are you lying
nobody would do that unless you were
like mentally ill or something
yeah now
Remember by my situation is that you
know the world is going to be destroyed
it's there's no question about it and
you would still do it
now if you were uncertain whether you're
right that would make sense if you said
well I don't know if Trump's you know
the end of the world but I worry about
it in that case I wouldn't break a rule
would you
suppose you just had a suspicion
the things would go wrong with some
candidate I wouldn't I wouldn't throw an
election in that case
I'm not even close I'm talking about
you're sure
that this candidate is just going to
destroy the world you're sure of it in
that case sure I would break any rule
there was
all right so the people who are saying
that they would not break the rule even
at the risk of the entire planet
now I'm seeing the real thinking is
being revealed here they don't believe
the setup so in other words they
rejected the hypothetical that there
could ever be a case
when there would be any danger
because who got elected right if that's
what you're saying then you're not good
at answering questions so that's the
problem
right the reason that I ask
hypotheticals is to force you to clarify
your thinking
if you refuse to clarify your thinking
that's a message too
that says something
all right
um
but here's the problem with uh
the Sam Harris opinion
and again I guess I would be speculating
and reading some Minds a little bit here
it's a little bit unfair but it's hard
to avoid
um how could you be honest
in this situation
and Sam Harris I don't think he has the
capability of just lying
I think it's sort of Beyond his his
framework
because first of all I don't think I've
seen an example of it
ever
does anybody I don't think he's ever
been accused of lying has he like ever I
mean this is it's pretty amazing when
there's a public figure
that you know we could all sort of have
some familiarity with and as far as you
know
that person has never tried to lie to
you you could disagree with them all day
long
but they haven't tried to lie to you
right so I don't think that Sam Harris
is lying do you
there's no evidence of that
but what do you do if your honest
opinion is that somebody is so dangerous
that bending some rules might make some
sense if that's his opinion you really
couldn't Express that could you because
it would be so damaging
suppose you were a person who only tells
the truth and it's really important to
your
I don't know your psychological makeup
your brand your legacy it's just real
important that you tell the truth all
the time and I think Sam Harris is
probably the best example of that his
entire you know being is wrapped around
rationality and being honest
so
how does he deal with the fact that if
he believes
what he says about trump it does make
perfect moral sense to rig an election
but I think that it's so dangerous to
say that because it that that gets taken
out of context of course
of course it would be taken out of
context and of course it would be used
as evidence that it was rigged when we
don't have proof of that
so wouldn't it be really dangerous for
Sam Harris to be honest about
the hypothetical
that if you believe that Trump was as
bad as he believes and you have the
ability to ring the election
then maybe it wouldn't be the dumbest
thing in the world
I don't think that they can say out loud
what they're actually thinking imagine
having a point of view
that you're afraid to say out loud
it's common to all of us I think but
I think the problem is that they
actually can't say their actual opinion
because it would be
um
it would sound disgusting
even to themselves when they said it out
loud
so if you have an opinion that you can't
a political opinion that you can't
express in public
that's a problem
he's afraid of being canceled
I suppose we all are
but anyway this this is more interesting
than any of the other people in the news
because uh you know well you don't know
but
a strong assumption he's not lying
so think think about how interesting
this is he the reason he's such a good
discussion case
not lying
not stupid
not under informed
when do you ever see that
in all of politics when do you ever say
not lying
not stupid and not not misinformed
and then he has a different opinion than
I do
now you don't know it but I can know it
of myself I'm not lying
I think I'm smart enough to be in the
conversation and I think I'm well
informed enough
to be in the conversation too so how do
you explain
of course this is be complimenting
myself here but how do you explain two
people who are not lying they're both
smart they're both well informed and
have completely different views on Trump
how do you explain that
well the the explanation I would give is
that one of us is experiencing cognitive
dissonance
and then how do you tell which one it is
do you remember my trick for doing that
what's the trick for say who has the
cognitive distance
the trick is is if you can take the
other side of the argument and give a
full-throated argument for it to show
that you understand it
but if you can't do that you're probably
in some other kind of a mental situation
now I believe I could take Sam Harris's
argument and completely explain it I
don't know if he could do that with mine
probably could but I don't know it
and that would be interesting wouldn't
it how would you like to see the two of
us
you know say talk split screen and we
just do that exercise
where I try to take his point of view
and explain it as well as I can and then
he tries to take my point of view and
explain explain it as well as he can
do you think we could do it
here's the interesting thing I bet we
could probably could I don't think I've
ever seen it before I've never actually
never seen it I've never seen anybody do
that before
it would be fascinating
but I suspect also maybe we might think
the other one hadn't quite nailed it you
know maybe left something out
well we probably we'd probably end up
pretty close
on that all right here's my theory
I think that uh in my opinion it looks
obvious that he's experiencing cognitive
distance
to me it looks obvious
but
it might look obvious to him that I'm
experiencing cognitive distance
and how would you know who's right you
wouldn't really unless you do that
exercise and we might both pass that as
well
so
um
here's what I would say about that
before Trump was elected the first time
I think it was a reasonable fear
that maybe he was as bad as the worst
the worst Impressions right you didn't
know
I didn't know
in the first election it wasn't
impossible that he could have turned
into some kind of monster once he got an
office it wasn't impossible
I didn't think it would happen
but it wasn't impossible
so four years go by and it doesn't
happen
the one thing that many of us would
disagree with Trump is how he handled
the losing
if handling the losing is the only you
know major thing that justifies their
opinion
I feel like that's clearly cognitive
distance
so here's the part that I would like to
see Sam Harris respond to
what would be his response to the fact
that a Harvard study showed that
two-thirds at least two-thirds of the
people who are at the protest believed
that they were saving the Republic they
honestly believe the election had been
rigged and not necessarily because Trump
told them
they were they felt that from the moment
they saw the result it wasn't because
Trump told them everybody saw it so how
does he explain that two-thirds of the
people there genuinely
in their in their deepest feelings
felt something had gone wrong and they
were there to fix it
to actually repair the Republic not to
overthrow it to repair it
why would why would two-thirds of the
people there who believe they were there
to repair the public or more I think why
would why would you imagine that Trump
was not one of those
because the majority opinion was that
something was wrong and they needed to
fix it that it was the minority opinion
that nothing was wrong and we need to
throw overthrow the country anyway
yeah well why would you imagine that
Trump would be signing on to the dumbest
of the opinion when the smartest one is
just right there it's right there people
thought they were saving the Republic
how do you how do you rule that out
you can't
and now
um today is a live stream will be a
little truncated because my Dilbert
career is in great Jeopardy at the
moment so I'm spending all my time
trying to fix that
problem is I've been drawing for
I don't know 15 years or something on a
Wacom tablet in Photoshop and I think
Photoshop either changed how the program
works
or there's some setting or I've got a
bug I don't know but I can no longer
paste something and then draw on top of
it
I mean I can manipulate some things so I
can get it done but the manipulation
would take too long I just couldn't use
the tool if I had to do that
so
I've I published my problem
on on Twitter for everybody to give me
advice what do you think happens when
you ask for a technical advice let me
tell you
they will tell you to reboot which I've
already done they'll tell you to make
sure you have the new version of the
software which I've already done
they will also look at the screen that
you give them and they'll say oh your
problem is that you have that that icon
pressed even though the picture shows
it's clearly not indicated
so some will hallucinate that there's a
lock that's set when it's not you can
see it clearly
others will tell you Scott why don't you
Google it
now you could Google all day long you'll
never find a technical Solution by
Googling have you ever found a technical
Solution by Googling it I've tried
I've tried about a billion times
when you do it with consumer software
it might be different if you're
programming you know developer probably
does find answers but if you're just
using a commercial piece of software
what happens when you look for your
answer online
it's all different versions
what happened when I asked people they
sent me screenshots of what exactly what
menu I should select do you think
there's any chance that the screenshots
that people sent me actually exist on my
software of course not it's a different
version that they solved it's either for
Windows or it's an old one or something
then somebody will say well have you
tried the
frame again blah blah menu
and I'll say I would try that if it
existed
but mine does not have a frame again
menu I don't know what you're looking at
so basically all of your all of your
technical help is going to be
read the manual what doesn't help Google
it that doesn't help reboot it doesn't
help update the software that doesn't
help and then there's always this one
bastard
there's always one bastard
who says the only thing you can do is uh
Delete all of your software and reload
it
I'm not going to do that I will sell my
computer before I do that because you
know it's just going to be problems yeah
so the problem is that when I paste a
layer I can't draw on the layer unless I
unless I send it to background and I
didn't ever have to send it to
background before
you should be able to write on the layer
you just pasted that's just basic
yeah so if I have to change to a new
software there's going to be a big
learning curve I've got a deadline I'm
up against so here's the problem I don't
know that I can solve this problem
before my deadline
and I don't know that it's solvable
because the solution might be to stop
using Photoshop and use something else
now some people said why don't you
contact Adobe technical support
I would never even try
I'd never even try
do you think there's any chance that's
going to work
one yeah it's not a walking problem it's
definitely not a walking problem it's a
definitely a Photoshop problem
now it's not going to work
have you ever tried to get technical
support on the phone
that's not a thing
now there you'll just be sent through
the phone trees and then it'll
disconnect and then you get somebody
who's started yesterday
yeah then it would take me probably two
hours even to find a contact number
I mean I'd Google it it'd be the wrong
number I'd try this they they tell me
that I gotta use the other number
yeah customer service isn't really a
thing that happens anymore
so there's not really any customer
service from a tech company
right I mean you could try but it's just
gonna be a waste of half a day sitting
on hold
and then getting nothing
um what would dilber do
I don't know but I know what dogberg
would do
dogbert would make it a huge public
problem
so the Adobe has to fix it for me
because it's probably here's what I
think I think they did it intentionally
I think it's an intentional change to
the software I think I don't think it's
a bug I think it's intentional now it
could be that somebody requested it
because there's some Advantage about the
way they're doing it so I think somebody
benefits from this change but it makes
it useless to me like I it would make my
job so hard
I don't know if I could even bother
doing it with the software anyway
yeah you can't really reinstall the old
version because it's a subscription
service and
yeah
if I tried to do that it would take
longer
than I have so I'm either going to have
to miss my deadline
or a miracle has to happen
brush mode behind
and the culprit is brush mode and behind
well I don't know what that means so
most of the people who give me all right
so here's a good example the culprit is
brush mode and behind what do I do with
that
I don't know what to do with that
I I those are just words brush mode and
behind
what's that mean
I know the layer needs to be you know
moved but I don't want to move the layer
that's the problem
it's a consumer version
right click I don't have a right click
I'm on a Mac so but most of your advice
is going to be for a Windows that's the
problem
compressed layers and draw no it doesn't
work even even compressing the even
flattening the layers can't draw on it
yeah
no there's lots of things I can do to
hack it
but it doesn't just work
it used to work
you can't debug it up the pen draw debug
it pick up the pen
closer to drawing or you can't even use
it
reset the flux capacitor I need to do
that
yeah so what happened was when I paste
the layer I can't draw on the new layer
and there's no reason for that that I
can see and don't say that I got
something locked because nothing's
locked
okay now you're getting closer now
you're saying a two finger click on the
track pad that I can do
but when you tell me Windows commands
for my Mac I don't know what to do with
that
uh
procreate saves the project no I've
saved it and reopened it I've done all
the obvious stuff
it could back up to the racial install
overs I'm not going to do that I'm not
going to erase my whole hard disk and
reinstall all my software for this one
bug which is not a bug
I don't believe it's a bug that's the
problem if you think it's a bug
that's a whole different problem this
appears to be a software change
which maybe I can unchange with some
kind of a setting but I don't know where
it would be
um
let me fix it Scott is waking up
now the problem with this is that I'll
get so many suggestions that I won't
know which ones are right
and I could pour through the wrong ones
all day long
I don't think there's any kid that could
solve this honestly I I think that maybe
Adobe just made a change and there's
nothing I can do about it
release notes
yeah I'm not going to do that
previous version I can't I don't have
access to a previous version it says
subscription
foreign
stop answering if you're not an artist
all right
Google how to revert to previous
software versions no I'm not going to
revert to a previous software version
I I'm never going to do that
I'm going to fix it with this version or
some future one but I'm not going to
revert
I'm not going to revert to any because
that's just asking for a whole bunch of
new problems
all right
um
let me uh bail out I've got to get so
there's there's nothing else I can do
today except work on this one problem
