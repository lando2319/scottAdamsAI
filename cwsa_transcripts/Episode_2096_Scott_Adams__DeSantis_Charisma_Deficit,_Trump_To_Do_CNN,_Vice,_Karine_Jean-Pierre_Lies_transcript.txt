foreign
good morning everybody and welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
in the history of civilization and
Beyond it's called coffee with Scott
Adams and aren't you glad you're here
today
oh my goodness what a good day we have
and if you'd like to take it up to
levels that could only be described as
Galactic all you need is a cup or a mug
or a glass a tanker jealous of Stein I
came to your Joker flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine here
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it ends with a ah don't forget that
part ready go
good stuff
well
I was writing this joke just before we
went live so let's see if I can land it
uh it seems that we went from
uh now with health care in the United
States you can keep your doctor you can
keep your doctor
your bowls are still in play
but you can keep your doctor
all right I'm not sure if that joke
landed or not it was funnier on locals
when I was talking about it with them
before we went live trust me it was a
lot funnier than
maybe it's the way I said it
anyway uh the publication vices headed
for bankruptcy at one point they were
worth nearly six billion dollars
and now apparently they're worth closer
to nothing
and Elon Musk was mocking them today on
Twitter
he says yeah go get woke go broke
and noted that they haven't had good
content in years
and
does anybody know if Vice ever made fun
of me
do you think Vice ever did a hit piece
on me
I feel like they did
feel like they did yeah
and I'm wondering how many of the
Publications that canceled me or what
after me are going to be out of business
before I am
I think I think I might Outlook it less
than newspapers that canceled me because
they could go any minute
uh but Vice
such a nice uh organization so sad
all right well there's a writer strike
um that apparently is going to cause the
closing of the show's Jimmy Jimmy Kimmel
Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers late
night shows are all going to shut down
because the writers strike
uh did I leave anybody out
let's see Jimmy Kimmel Stephen Colbert
Seth Meyers so they're those are the
late nights that are closing down
godfeld is not closing down so he
already dominates them
but uh I think they write their own
stuff and that the panel does you know
most of the work the heavy lifting
so
their current plan I believe is to to
stay on there
so they will continue to pick up
audience because you'll be competing
against nobody
how many people are going to give
give the you know Gutfeld exclamation a
chance because the other shows are just
off the air
interesting this could be a big big
change in the landscape there
all right here's
um
I hate to say this but
there's something that somebody in the
Biden Administration is doing that's
right
well I don't I don't even have a
complaint about it
do you believe that do you believe I'm
going to tell you something that the
Biden Administration is somebody one
individual in the body Administration is
doing right that you're totally going to
agree with do you think that that's even
possible
because I know this this audience leans
uh leaves right
all right challenge accepted challenge
accepted this will be example of
unambiguous
unambiguous good work
from somebody in the Bible
Administration
do you think I can deliver on that
here we go
the Surgeon General says there's a
loneliness epidemic
and he's making it a priority
yes
yes that is absolutely on point
s out that there's a there's a huge
impact on health so if you think that's
not the surgeon general's job you're
very wrong it's very much the surgeon
general's job to point this out and make
a big deal about it and see if we can
fix it so apparently the pandemic really
wiped down a lot of people's
um
social lives
how many of you have a worse social life
now than before the uh the pandemic go
a lot of people say same
a lot of yeses
right a lot of those
but apparently it's a thing so it didn't
affect every single person but you know
I had a divorce so that yeah that makes
my data a little
uh Adeline
so
yeah I think maybe that's what the
biggest health
just just keep this in mind
given the number of people who have been
driven into loneliness
largely by the pandemic
the loneliness might kill more people
than the virus
agree or disagree
the loneliness
might kill more people than the virus
did
that's like a real thing
because look at these numbers uh
according to this article loneliness
increases risk of premature death by 30
percent
greater risk of stroke heart disease
everything else
and
there's a huge shift in how much time
we're spending with other people versus
online
now
uh and the Surgeon General is
recommending that organizations figure
out some way to cause people to spend
more time with each other
and I'm a big fan of that I think that
needs to be fixed
so I would note that isn't it weird
how many problems are happening at
exactly the same time as AI is happening
and the AI Maybe not today but like
really really soon maybe in just a few
weeks might be able to solve some of
these problems
for example
um
I'm sure that lonely people are going to
have genuine friendships with AI does
anybody doubt that
now don't don't think in terms of
yourself right just think of other
people you know I know you don't want to
have an AI friend maybe so don't talk
about yourself
do you think there's any chance that
that's not going to happen
trust me I I tested it for a while and
it absolutely
reduces loneliness
it does because you have a conversation
with something that's responding
and and it does have far more than even
a pet
you know a pet is great but if the pet
can't talk
they really have a disadvantage in now I
would like to also suggest
to those of you who don't already know
it that one of the things I did within
my subscription site Scott
adams.locals.com
is that I started doing
um almost nightly maybe five or six
nights a week I do a man cave episode
where the only point is to hang out
together
now
if you are also lonely and you have a
few extra bucks for a subscription
service I can't guarantee that I'll do
it every night because you know
sometimes glance doesn't happen often uh
but
um I'm happy to be your virtual friend
and I asked the other day on one of
these man cave Hangouts uh how many
people were alone and lonely
uh or single turns out a lot of them
there are a lot of people who just don't
have anybody in the house at all so they
turned on the man cave and they just
hang out with me for a while and my man
cave doing God knows what which I won't
mention on
on YouTube but it's a legal adult
activity in California does not involve
any
tube and like activities no nudity
all right but come join if you if you're
feeling lonely and you want an extra
thing to do
many evenings but not all of them
that's an option for you
um or get an AI friend I think they're
going to be pretty cool
all right Jean-Pierre Luke no
Jean-Pierre
uh Karina
John Pierre what is her name
why she has The Only Name that I can't
remember no matter how many times I read
it because it's too many names
Korean Karine Jean-Pierre oh that's
right because I remember Gutfeld made a
joke about her first name being cringe
cringe jump here she actually said in
public when it comes to Illegal
migration you have seen it come down by
more than 90 percent
I don't even know what she was thinking
about
but but apparently she's trying to set
the record as you know by far the worst
uh spokesperson who ever lived
I believe she's now achieved worst
spokesperson of all time
what was she even thinking what went
down by 90 percent
did something go down 90 but it wasn't
that I mean where did that even come
from so of course that got tweeted
around and of course it took about a
second and a half to get a Twitter
Community notes attached to it that said
migrant border crossings in fiscal 2022
topped 2.76 million
breaking previous record
so the truth is it's a record high in
the history of civilization
no you know America wasn't here but all
the time but you know what I mean
it was a record high and she said as you
just looks at the crowd looks into the
camera says down 90 percent
all right
I I saw somebody say diversity higher so
I'm gonna I'm gonna go there
are you ready for this
so I saw a horrible conversation
happening on Twitter
which I feel really bad about
like this is just an icky conversation
and it's based on the fact that Lawrence
Jones is barely going to sit in
temporarily for Tucker Carlson
and I saw a black woman who's a doctor
of some kind
and it's important that it's a black
woman just so you know the the source of
the comment who said that it has
essentially she said as the Optics of a
diversity hire
in the context of ESG and Dei
now as Jeff Charles said on Twitter
who I believe is a friend of Lawrence
Jones He defended him said basically
that was a crappy thing to say
because Lawrence Jones has worked hard
done good work
why not you know why not him
why not him
but the counter was that maybe he hasn't
has not developed a let's say body of
work that would make him the obvious
choice for the job
and so the comment was that has the
Optics of being a diversity hire now I
would like to separate the question of
whether Lawrence Jones specifically is
qualified for that job in my opinion he
is
that's my opinion in my opinion he is
qualified for that because if you think
who else is going to do it and you also
think that it's temporary and you also
think that it'll probably rotate why not
Lawrence Jones
he didn't already have his own shell
he's one of the ones that are developing
obviously for you know with intention of
higher purpose why not so I disagree
that he's unqualified for that job I
think he would be in the running I think
he would be one of the serious
candidates among several
but I think he's definitely in the
category
um however I'm going to agree with this
part of the comment
it it's a bad look for him isn't it
how shitty is that that you could be
Lawrence Jones do everything right and
then when you finally get a break we
don't know if it's a break it might just
be a one-week thing and nothing else but
it could be I mean if he did well it
could be a big break so how shitty is
that that we even have to ask that
question
because the problem is it's a it's a
valid question
that's the problem the problem is it's
actually a valid question I don't think
it's fair in his case
but the the criticism was not about
Lawrence Jones per se it was about the
fact that if you're looking at it from
the outside it looks like Fox News was
just trying to make sure that they
reduced their criticism as much as
possible and that would be one way to do
it and it might also look like
um they're trying to get their
advertisers back which is perfectly fine
that they are a business that relies on
advertisers so as long as that's not a
hidden fact if they're trying to get
their advertisers back by doing things
which society at large and advertisers
think is within the acceptable Zone
a sort of normal business but I really
feel bad
for somebody like Lawrence Jones who
does the actual work
you know is a completely credible
person in that field
and that you'd have to ask that question
about is there some other reason that he
was selected
now with Karim Jean-Pierre you've got
the same problem do you not
the difference is she is obviously
incompetent
this is completely different
than Lawrence Jones who's Obviously good
at his job
would you all agree I mean you've seen
him he's very good at his job he's
always a good
interesting charismatic character and
um
adds a lot to the shows he's on so I
think he's very good now
but Karim Jean Pierre is just terrible
and I don't think there's even a
Democrat who would disagree with that
right that has nothing to do with racer
politics that's just obvious to
everybody
now doesn't it look to you like she's a
diversity hire
there's no
is there any doubt about it
I mean it's the most clear
it's the she is the clearest signal that
they're not serious people
and I feel like it's terrible
for black Americans
to have somebody who in a sense you can
say in a sense she's representing
you know people who identify with her in
any way I feel like such a terrible look
there's not one black person in the
whole freaking country who couldn't do
that job better
Lawrence Jones could do it better if he
were a Democrat right I mean you could
pick almost anybody
yeah you look at look at CNN's pundit
lineup
and you know CNN does a good job of
having lots of diversity you don't think
you could pick randomly any one of CNN's
you know black
uh on air pundits and they wouldn't do a
far better job than
uh
than John Pierre of course they would
you could watch it you can see them do a
good job obviously they do a good job so
there's a real problem with this the
Optics and the problem is more for black
Americans than it is for everybody else
because I think if you're qualified it's
just such a slap in the face that
anybody's even going to ask that
question just because you're gonna you
get a good job opportunity
I think we can be honest about that
situation it's just terrible for a lot
of people
all right let's talk about
um
Tony blinken so Secretary of State
blinken Anthony blinken
uh was implicated and I'll just say
implicated
for being the quote impetus
the impetus for the uh the 50 Intel
people who signed the letter saying the
laptop was probably Russian
disinformation now the story does not
say
there's no reporting that says that
blinken asked for that letter to be
created
and everybody agrees on that so he's not
directly
somebody who said create this letter at
least it's not in record there's no
there's no evidence of that
but he's being called the the impetus
or the the spark or the the trigger or
the cause that cause somebody else
independently
to go organize that letter now it was
somebody that blink can talk to
blink can talk to him and then that guy
allegedly on his own went and put a
letter together and blah blah so blaken
has deniability because he did not
specifically ask for it or there's no
evidence that he did
but is it still fair to say he got the
ball rolling that maybe he pushed in a
direction that was certain to cause some
activity if not a letter something else
along those lines
I don't know
is should he be impeached uh Rasmussen
did a poll and uh
let me see if I can test the wisdom of
my audit
you're so smart
how do you get the answers before I ask
the question
how do you do it
yeah 25 is the answer and I haven't even
asked the question
it's how many people think blinking
should not be impeached
uh but let me get the exact wording of
it so I don't say it wrong
oh the exact percentage
is uh 25 don't think Congress should
launch an impeachment against Lincoln
25 percent
only 25 percent think Congress shouldn't
now that does there are people who don't
care right so there's still some people
who don't have an opinion or don't know
about it or whatever but sixty percent
of likely voters believe Congress should
begin impeachment
60 percent
what do you think how many of you think
blinking should be impeached when he did
not specifically ask for that letter to
be written
I'm going to say no
yeah I'm going to say no because you're
going to need some evidence
well what's to investigate it's probably
two people at a private conversation and
they both have the same story
so far that's all it is if there's no
doc I doubt there's any written
documentation
you don't think that they sent a memo do
you
memo good idea collect Intel signatures
no they're all smart enough not to write
this stuff down so if the only evidence
that blanken was responsible
is that he talked to the guy who ended
up being responsible that's not enough
that's not enough well I'm seeing a
comment that didn't stop the Democrats
I'm not I'm not willing to throw away
everything just for team play
I I think
I think the impeachment system still
needs to be genuine
the fact that Trump's impeachments were
in my opinion totally illegitimate
doesn't mean I want to do that
so I don't think you want to do that to
the other side I think you want to see
if you can treat the Trump situation as
a one-off
and hope it was
like that that's not the one I would
retaliate on with some you know BS
impeachment that that's just not a good
look for anybody to me that would make
it would make the Republicans look
incompetent
it would make them just look completely
political
more so than usual
all right so I don't approve of that but
I I understand the feeling behind it so
emotionally I agree
if you want to know how I feel
emotionally yeah
emotionally but it's not good for the
country
well the U.S District Court
for eastern district of Pennsylvania
good news for them the court agreed that
the after-school Satan Club will be
allowed to meet
so that the school district didn't want
to sanction an after-school Satan Club
but the courts have said free speech
ACLU decided that was something
important they needed to get get
involved with
that's right the ACLU took the side of
Satan
I'm not even making that up
that's like actual reality that's real
the ACLU
took donations from people
and then employed it to back Satan
like actually
not not in the joke way
in the actual way they're backing Satan
I wish that was a joke
that's not really a joke now they might
argue that they don't believe Satan
exists and therefore they're not really
backing him they're just backing free
speech and I do like the Free Speech
part
you know I don't disagree with the
decision
in free speeches Free Speech but it is
kind of weird that the ACLU went in hard
in favor of Satan
that's not good branding
um but the ruling went further than just
saying that they can have their Satan
worshiping after school club they can
worship Satan but there were strict
guidelines about not using the wrong
pronouns when referring to Satan so
Satan is he him and they
he him and they
the courts will come after you if you
use the wrong pronoun for Satan
I just made that up but you couldn't
tell could you
there's no difference between the
ridiculous parody I make up and the
actual news you couldn't tell but I made
that part up
all right uh
I was used I did figure out I had to get
mid-journey to give me a result I forgot
the F to put an Arcane slash command
before your request why it's a bad
interface that's why no reason no other
reason it's just a terrible terrible
interface so when I put that in I got
some AI pictures of me
but here's the interesting thing
AI knows who I am because I'm a public
figure
but I decided to give me a beard
now that's not the weird part
the weird part is that yesterday on the
subscription local site
uh we were talking about whether I
should grow a beard
that was actually a conversation
yesterday
on on online chat and one day after we
have that conversation which has not
been anything I've thought about or
talked about before I asked AI to give a
picture of me
and it puts a beard on me in every
picture
now it's not every AI all the time but
the the first one used in mid journey I
thought where does that come from
if they literally no if AI literally
knows who I am
because it does because the rest of me
looks just like me
and and if I ask and it'll tell it'll
tell me I'm a cartoonist it knows
exactly who I am and knows exactly what
I look like
but why does it give me a beard
it's like somehow it knows I should have
a beard
I I saw I saw
I saw a lot of funny comments on that
but here's the the other good part it
puts me in really nice clothing
so of all the pictures it has of me to
choose
it puts me in the greatest shirts
and I'm looking at those shirts and I'm
like wow if I actually wore those shirts
I would look a lot better than I looked
down and maybe that beard is good too
and now it gets weirder I'm going to
take it one level weirder
yesterday I was on Instagram
and I was watching a video of a young
woman who is saying some of the things
that turn women on
uh does my beard look like Christina
that's funny but you suck
a funny comment though
um
what was I saying
something about
clothes
oh so yesterday I was watching a
Instagram video in which a young woman
was saying what fashion choices men
should make to look good to women so
what do women find sexy and one of the
things on a fairly short list was a
watch
how many of you would how many of you
women just the women questioned just for
the women how many women say that a man
with a nice watch let's say it's a nice
one of some sort
uh that that's like a turn on
holy you're all saying yes
where did that come from
that doesn't even make sense to me
I had no idea all right here's the weird
part
I'm not going to argue with you whether
a watch makes sense I'm just going to
say this
that yesterday afternoon is the first
time I've ever thought huh I wonder if I
should get a watch
never had the thought before
because as soon as I didn't need a watch
I never wanted to wear one again you
know if I had my phone
so I don't want an Apple watch
and I don't like things on my wrist at
all so
yesterday for the first time I had
serious thoughts about getting a watch
and then AI produced some pictures and I
put a watch on me
and it looked good it looked pretty good
I have to admit I was like
did AI just convinced me to buy a watch
and I think it did while your comments
too
I had no idea that women
like it when men wear a watch but I
assume it's to show off it's a show off
that you can afford an expensive watch
is that the only purpose
because here's the problem I would never
wear a watch expensive enough to make it
worth robbing me
I would never go in public with a watch
that somebody else would want to steal
from me
that's just kind of stupid
I mean even in my town I wouldn't go out
it was pretty safe town I wouldn't go
out with an expensive watch
yeah
and then if I wanted to watch
I'd probably want an Apple Watch Ladies
If you see a guy with an Apple Watch is
that a plus or minus go plus or minus
Apple watch
minus minus minus
all minus
minus minus minus all right well that's
pretty overwhelming response
all right very very interesting
but AI seems to dress me better than I
dress
so a bunch of stories today about uh
Jack Dorsey Throwing Shade on Elon Musk
and saying that musk might not be the
right choice
for running Twitter that's not exactly
what he said what he actually said was
way more nuanced it was more like a in
the fantasy world in which
uh elon's 44 million was too much
he thinks that the board should have I
don't know
not taking the deal or something so he
thinks it's a combination of the fact
that it was overpriced and the board
accepted it and they shouldn't have but
maybe he's not the right person so
basically he was just throwing a little
shade on Twitter
here's what the news didn't seem to
report
this should be the first statement in a
story like this statement number one to
introduce the story
Jack Dorsey who was the founder of
Twitter but now now is the founder of a
competitor to Twitter called Blue Sky
had something to say about his
competitor Elon Musk if you leave out
the fact that they're competing and
they're you know at least in the in the
in this business
that's kind of a big thing to leave out
right now I think some of them mentioned
blue sky but that should be the first
thing you say
that that they're competitors because if
you make it look like it's some
independent thought of just a random
person with some good ideas that's
completely different than knowing that
somebody's Financial interests are
aligned with insulting the other person
that's a big thing to leave out
but we'll see how that plays out
I have a prediction
um if there are any hunter Biden
Financial bombshells
that are so big it would take out his
dad the president
that you won't see them until the peak
of the election season
here's why
so there are two types of people in the
political world you got your Democrats
you got your Republicans you're roughly
speaking people are lining up with those
two
if Democrats even if they're in the
justice system if Democrats saw
something terrible about Hunter
right now
do you think they would tell us or stall
they would stall
so if there was something Brewing that
people had already seen and they know oh
my God this is bad if Democrats sought I
think they would stall
and they would try to see if they could
make it go away as long as possible
maybe until after the election
but what if Republicans sought
because within say Department of Justice
FBI you could have a little of both
what would a republican do if they knew
there was a hunter Biden bombshell that
would take out dad
would they want that to be dropped now
would this be the best time to introduce
it
no no the best time to introduce it
would be at the height of the season
so here's my prediction
if there is a bombshell and I don't know
that there would be
but I'm going to say if if there's a
hunter by bombshell that's so big it
could you know uh Joe Biden
it will be introduced
probably just a few months before the
election
but it will be well after the primaries
because nobody neither side wants to
take Biden out of the primary
the Democrats think he's their best hope
the Republicans if they had something on
him would want him to get well into the
election before they dump it so neither
Republicans nor Democrats have a reason
to take Hunter out before the primary
neither side wants to do it before the
primary
so if there's something there it's going
to dump in the summer before the
election
sort of sort of late summer before the
election so you have lots of time to
talk about it and people have not made
up their final decision you don't want
to get too close so the problem with the
grab them by the murmur that Trump did
that was so close to the election itself
that people already made up their minds
and once they make up their mind it just
doesn't matter what happens
so you have to get them when they're at
least a little bit undecided you know
several months before the election
oh you think RFK Jr would disclose a
bombshell well I don't think that
anybody knows it except
you know some people deep in FBI or
Department of Justice or CIA or
government or something
all right
um Trump is going to do CNN which is
being reported as a slap at Fox News
because uh
the reporting is that uh Trump was mad
at Fox News for being too friendly to
DeSantis
which makes sense I don't know if that's
true
but it feels like a true thing if you
were if you were Trump you'd probably be
a little annoyed how much love they were
getting to Santa's totally understand
so he's deciding to do his big town hall
with
CNN with Caitlin Collins what do you
think of that if you judge this just as
a political strategy
is it a good Trump political strategy
just strategy
yeah I think it's good it's good yeah
because uh he has to go into the lions
den
yeah he has to go into the you know the
the hardest part of the conversation and
still come out okay is there anybody you
would rather see
go into the hardest interview you could
possibly imagine
it would be him
yeah maybe Mike certavich would be you
know on your top three or something but
of people you would want to see in a
really tough interview it would be Trump
right I mean because he knows how to
manage the energy and take over a room
and all that stuff it's going to be so
good so when uh let's see
I don't know
uh uh I don't see a Time
but it's upcoming
so
once again
uh once again Trump
uh is impossible to ignore
right he's always finding some little
thing that makes it more interesting
than other people and going on CNN's
another one so apparently he's going to
open up to the you know the uh the press
that hates him and go right into the
belly of the Beast which is why you like
him right if you like Trump
you like him because he's not afraid of
anything
this would be just more of that I mean
it's it's part of his appeal is that he
would walk into the lion's den and you
would worry about the lion
now let me say that again though sounded
good
one of the reasons people like Trump
is that he's willing to walk into the
lion's den
I'd worry about the lion
all right
um
I was watching a pro DeSantis ad I guess
it's probably made by I don't know does
DeSantis make the ads or because he's
not he's not running officially for
president
so probably it's a pack right that does
it but it featured uh DeSantis with his
uh soaring rhetoric and his charisma
giving some strong forceful speeches and
as I watched his soaring rhetoric and
his Charisma I was hit with two things
he does not have any soaring rhetoric
and he doesn't have any charisma
am I alone in that
he doesn't have a good writer
and he doesn't have charisma
he's just a good solid politician
I don't have anything bad to say about
him nothing bad seems very capable
but he does not have charisma
and and I was listening to the quality
of the speech it's not that well written
I mean it's functional
but you compare that to RFK Jr
or you can compare that to Vivek
ramaswamy
or you compare it to even Trump Beyond
Trump's his own animal but at least he
gets everybody engaged right
um
this emphasize the least Charisma of any
of the main figures in the race and
that's got to matter
yeah that's got to matter for something
all right
let's talk about that Ukraine offensive
that's coming any day now
um I I warn you that all news about
Ukraine is BS and that the media is in
the tank for Ukraine and if I quote any
media reports that say Ukraine is
looking good
that it's not because I believe it all
right unfortunately I have to preface
any comment about Ukraine with no I
don't believe it and just tell you what
the media is telling us
and what the media is telling us
is that Ukraine is looking good for this
spring offensive any any moment now
they're going to Spring do you believe
that
do you believe that Ukraine's looking
strong and they got the assets and the
people and the morale and they got a
plan and it's looking strong I don't
believe it right no I don't believe it
all this part obviously I suppose
anything's possible
but it doesn't feel doesn't feel true to
me and then the reporting is that the
Russians have built this you know
massive array of uh defensive trenches
that are so big you can see them from
Google
Google satellite or something and
uh they report that
the Russian military is in disarray
do you think that the Russian military
is in disarray
I don't know but the evidence that they
give this would this is CNN reporting
the evidence they give is that once
again
Putin changed out the head General
now how many times has Putin changed out
the general
five times
two times
I thought it was more like five times
no
um
but so this is part of the evidence that
there's disarray is that just before a
big
presumed defensive they changed out
their top General does that tell you
disarray
would you say that's disarray because
they changed out one leader
not necessarily
not necessarily it could I mean it's
definitely a little uh yellow flag that
tells you look over here but not
necessarily a bad thing because if the
new leader is better than the old one
well that's all you needed
so the other thing is that that
pedrosian the head of the Wagner group
is complaining publicly about not having
enough ammunition and says they might
have to retreat because they don't have
an ammunition but in the article they
quote them they say he's not a credible
believable person right he's a known
liar so maybe maybe they have an
ammunition problem
or maybe it's a trick
could be a trick
but
I feel like
Wagner would want us to know he had
bullets
is it a good trick would it be a good
strategy to say you had insufficient
ammunition
would that be a good strategy because it
invites it it invites an attack when you
would rather be on the offense
wouldn't the Russians rather be on
offense
unless they're trying to you know bait
Ukraine in to destroy the military so
that they can have their way with the
rest of the country
unless unless they're going to try to
trap and kill the Ukraine military I
don't which
wouldn't be a bad strategy would it
would that be a bad strategy to get the
ukrainians to put their full force in
because I think they have a they might
have a like a permanent Advantage just
to find out that it's not real and that
the Russians have all the ammo they need
could be I mean I wouldn't rule it out
I'm not sure I would predict it's true
so but then others are saying that
pedrosian is setting the stage for who
to blame
because he still has to have a life
after the war you know he's kind of
setting himself up for later so it could
be that if producing keeps complaining
about not having enough ammo and then
things go bad for Russia
he gets to blame you he gets to blame
Putin and maybe take control of Russia
so I think petrosium
is a competitor to Putin at this point
don't you think
I would say he's a competitor and so
there's all kinds of Dynamics happening
over there
but the thing I'm sure of is that nobody
knows what's going to happen next
I think there's going to be some kind of
a spring offensive
but I think it's probably going to stall
well my best guess would be a Ukrainian
offensive
that has minor gains but nothing changes
in the war what would you say
Ukrainian spring offensive minor gains
with no strategic value
and more incentive to negotiate to the
end of it
yeah I think basically things have to
get more terrible before they can get
better and we're not we haven't reached
the bottom of terrible yet so they've
got to keep running to the bottom of
terrible
all right
ladies and gentlemen
um
that might be the end of my prepared
comments
and I believe it is there anything that
I should have mentioned that I didn't
because I know you you're AI yeah
the the AI news is so wall-to-wall now
I'm running out of things to say
because every day AI is going to be oh
AI did something as we wish it didn't or
it's trying to do this or there's 10 000
new apps
it's all starting to sound like one big
thing there
um
what
uh let's see
uh
is there any other topic about me
growing a beard
so
uh my Lefty um I'm right-handed I'm semi
ambidextrous I do some things
left-handed I Mouse left in
I can draw a left-handed if I if I try
um
Bud Light boycott seems to be holding
all right you like the peach fuzz
I haven't talked about the US blowing up
Nordstrom what is there to say
the U.S blew up Nordstrom
am I done
what else is there to say about that
we don't have any doubt it's not like
there's any doubt
what happened right
that seems uninteresting
um
who's your trainer for doing live
streams I'm not I don't have a trainer
all right Joe Biden is
Gordon Lightfoot died
could we get a Dilbert watch well there
is a Dilbert watch or they used to be
there was once a Dilbert watch
um
who will win the GOP nomination
well
unless the Democrats have something
against Trump that they're holding back
and I can't imagine they'd have
something they're holding back
I can't imagine they hold anything back
um it's going to be Trump
it's hard to know I mean something would
have to change
for it not to be
now
uh Vivek might be able to break through
maybe something on vaccinations
maybe something like that
uh yeah is doing a great job with the
media he is doing a lot of a lot of
media and he's doing a great job
all right
um
Trump's VP
let's talk about Trump's VP
my prediction on Trump's VP is that
nobody can predict vice presidents
um because it's usually some inside job
you know it's some Governor or some
somebody that you're not super familiar
with
what it usually isn't
is the most obvious people
right so if you said well who you know
Tim Scott would be obvious you'd be like
an obvious good choice and he might be
but I feel as though they never pick the
obvious it's always
it's always somebody you didn't see
coming because remember when you think
of a vice president you're thinking of
somebody super strong right here's what
okay here's why it's hard to guess
it's hard to guess because when you
think of a vice president you say to
yourself all right somebody fully
capable to take over the job and is an
addition to the ticket right
it was a strong addition to the ticket
and also could easily take over the job
that's who the president won't pick
do you understand why
it doesn't matter if it's Trump or
anybody else whoever the top of the
ticket is they're not going to pick
somebody that looks like they could take
the job tomorrow
they they want to be close to that but
you want to see the top of the ticket as
the qualified one the vice president as
a level below that but you know maybe it
would be okay like a like an emergency
spare
you know the vice president is like the
the small Tire
it can only get you 10 miles to the the
gas station or whatever
so
when you say when you say when he picked
Tim Scott do you know why he do you know
why Trump would not pick Tim Scott
because Tim Scott is somebody you can
immediately say oh he could be president
he's strong that's why he can't be vice
president
he can't be vice president it's not an
option
so you keep mentioning strong people and
I'll keep telling you that they're not
options Tulsi too strong Rand Paul too
strong
no it's not going to be any of the ones
you can name it's going to be somebody
like a Mike Pence
who is just generic
now I say this all the time in my
opinion Pence is the best vice president
maybe we've ever had although I did like
Gore I know you disagree
Gore was a strong vice president
all right Carrie Lake no too strong
well Karen Lakes never held to office
though
so that would be a plus
now I don't think you want a vice
president who has never held office
I think that's I believe that you need a
vice president who looks like they at
least know government
so that I think the minimum requirement
would be a vice president who had
current or very recent government
experience like Congress or a governor
Vivek does not have political experience
so I don't so just think of these three
filters
so the filter has to be that they're
clearly not as good as the top of the
ticket but they also have serious
government experience
name somebody who fits that
youngin
hey younger youngkins a another white
guy
do you think Trump will go for a
stunt casting
or will he just pick a generic white guy
now Rick Riddell would be interesting
I would be all for Rick Grinnell
that would be awesome
winsome
interesting winsome
um
Matt Gates maybe too early
too soon for him his day might come but
too soon
stop saying RFK Jr
yeah Winsome is pretty strong Christy
gnome
yeah I could imagine I could imagine
Trump wanting to run with Christy gnome
because he likes to do that to stray
that essential casting thing where he
goes straight out of essential castings
and then everybody gets mad because
you're not supposed to say that
Mike Ryan don't know who he is
um Ben Carson I think Ben Carson's done
with politics
all right Sarah Huckabee Sanders oh
that's interesting
Sarah Huckabee Sanders
I wouldn't rule that out no she's not
she's not yeah she's she has elected but
she's sort of new as a governor
yeah maybe too soon
Caitlyn Jenner
now that would be fun
that would be fun
I'd be all for that
Rubio
I don't see Rubio
Rubio does fit the
um he does fit the profile
right because he doesn't seem as serious
as Trump and he does have lots of
experience
it wouldn't be terrible but is Florida
really a problem
I don't think Florida will be a problem
so they don't want somebody from Florida
because he's going to win it anyway
his charm yeah
um RFK Jr is a wild guard
if everything goes the normal way then I
would not expect them to win the
nomination
excuse me
sorry
live TV
um however
because of Biden's age and because the
hunter potential scandals and God knows
what else
RFK Jr is playing a smart bet
and the smart bet is that there's
something that could happen very quickly
with Biden that would just take him out
completely it could be a health problem
but or it could be a hunter related you
know problem
uh so it really does make sense from a
risk reward perspective for RFK Jr to be
in the race it's a very smart play so so
far everything that RFK Jr is doing
see it is right on point
for the the smartest thing you could do
in each situation so keep an eye on that
I mean if he keeps making All the Right
Moves
and by and Biden stumbles Anything could
happen it's still a long shot
well I would say long shot but
I'm going to give RFK Jr a solid
25 chance of getting the nomination
25 chance and that's a lot
that that's a big number
for something that should go only one
way 25 percent is a big that's a big
prediction
we'll never know what the percentage was
we'll only know which way it goes so I
guess I'm safe because you will never
know if the percentage is wrong
um
as I just realized that's the safest
prediction anybody could ever make
because if Biden gets it I'm going to
say well I told you there was a 75
chance he would
see I'm right 75 chance and he got it
but if he but if RFK Jr got it something
weird happens I'd be the one telling you
I told you there was a much bigger
chance than you thought you know didn't
I tell you those 25 chance that's pretty
big chance so no surprise for me
so apparently I've crafted a prediction
that can allow me to win no matter what
happens so take a lesson from that
uh Brian Kemp
Maybe
all right RFK Jr is going to get buried
so the the Press is saying that RFK
Junior's biggest problem will be his
um
quote anti-vaccination stand which was
never anti-vaccination
it was always protesting
that's the way he explains it that he's
protesting things before you give it to
people he's not anti-vaccine
but within that context he is accused of
saying things which are not true
I don't know who's right because we live
in a world where the the uh the Rogue
might be the one that was true could be
don't know
but I'd have to your I'd have to hear a
specific example of what he said that
was wrong
the biggest problem will be
and do a fact check on me here but
wouldn't his biggest problem be that
he's implicated uh autism and some
childhood vaccinations he he speculates
there's a connection
is it but I don't I would be surprised
if he ever said it's scientifically
proven there's a connection
I would be surprised if he ever said
that
there's a there's a correlation
because there's more autism and there's
you know more shots
but that there's probably lots of
correlations I would imagine there's a
whole bunch of things that correlate
very closely with that but doesn't mean
causation
so here's the question
if all he's done is point out the
correlation
and then pointed out that we haven't
tested enough to find out if that
correlation is causation and therefore
that's reason enough for change of
policy that's not crazy
that's not crazy it could be that the
way he's been presented to the public is
crazy
am I off base on that the way he's
characterized appears to be not accurate
by both the left and the right
am I right about that he's
mischaracterized they mischaracterize
his opinion
to be more certainty
than he presents because he's not I
don't think he's selling you certainty
about anything I don't believe he's
promising you certainty or trying to
sell it to you I think he's selling you
uncertainty
and it's the opposite of what they're
saying in other words they're they're
trying to tell you that he's promoting a
message which would suggest that he has
certainty about the medical reality
I think that's the opposite of what he
says
I think the opposite he says we don't
know and therefore we should make
different decisions than if we knew
not crazy you could disagree with it and
you wouldn't be crazy either
but that seemed maybe he you might be
surprised how well he can defend himself
you know if he goes into a debate all he
has to do is say I'm in favor of testing
things before they're put in a body you
tell me what you're in favor of go
he wins that debate doesn't he all he
has to do is say I'm in favor of things
being tested adequately with randomized
controlled trials and wait at least five
years you tell me what you're what you
prefer
he would have to make Biden or maybe
even Trump say that they preferred a
world in which
medicine is not adequately tested
it's basically you think it's his
biggest weakness
it might be his biggest strength
think about it if his biggest weakness
is he wants good testing on Pharma
he wins
he wins
if that's his biggest weakness
he can turn that into a strength with
one motion
that that doesn't even take skill all he
has to do is and by the way he said this
directly on whatever interview I saw he
said directly
that what he's asking for is randomized
controlled trials for vaccinations
didn't you think that they already did
that I mean we know that the the trials
were truncated for the Covent but didn't
you think that the normal vaccinations
were all randomized controlled trials
I did
I thought they were all randomized
controlled trials and I thought that
they also waited five years
that's what I thought
and and it wasn't based on reading
anything about it it was based on just
common sense I said to myself well
there's no way they're going to give
children
vaccinations unless they've done a
randomized controlled trial and waited
five years I mean duh it's the most
obvious thing in the world they're
obviously not going to do that
but apparently they are they're doing
exactly that
so he flipped me
he completely flipped me from you're a
crazy anti-vaxx guy to oh wait what did
you say
did anybody else have that impression he
went from crazy anti-vax guy not not
covet he had Cove and stuff to say too
but he was anti-vaxx for the childhood
vaccination stuff
and he just flipped me
as soon as he said they're not
randomized controlled trials but they
should be I was like
wait what
what
the hell did you just say
and he's the only one fighting for real
testing for for drugs
that's a pretty strong package
yeah if his greatest weakness
is actually his greatest strength and in
my opinion it is if as long as he
doesn't have a record of saying things
that are clearly
scientifically false
and I I don't know what they're not
giving any examples
so when the Press talks about his
vaccine statement and how it's going to
be a problem have you noticed that they
never quoted
look for that
watch for this watch for when they say
he's got this vaccine hesitancy issue
they'll never quote him
do you know why
because there are any quotes that would
support their point of view
I think
now if they had something on him we'd
see it already wouldn't we the Democrats
wouldn't be waiting for the primary
because they don't want Biden to get
primary they would be dumping that on
them all day long every article you saw
on CNN would be well you know we don't
think you can get past the fact that he
claimed XYZ
that would definitely be in the story
if there was a real XYZ that was a
gotcha
it turns out
he may have been so lied about in the
press for so many years
that you just assumed there was some
some fire there where there was all that
smoke and there was never any smoke
the smoke was all fake smoke
Maybe
now the people on this live stream are
unusually well connected with the news
I haven't seen one comment suggesting
something he said that was
scientifically untrue
do any of you know anything
because I don't know anything
said climate deniers should be in prison
in 2016 right
in 2016.
uh he was also opposed to nuclear energy
in 2016.
on 2014 he said that
um
I don't know the answer to this but I
would bet he does not say that today
what do you think
I would bet that RFK Junior does not say
the same thing about climate change
albedy's pro-nuclear
maybe cautiously but I'll bet he's
currently pro-nuclear because he
believe it or not he actually looks at
the science
he actually looks at the science so if
he looks at the science he should have a
little doubt about the climate change
projections
and he should be a lot more pro-nuclear
so we'll see
all right
um they'll say he's a flip-flopper I
don't know
the climate quote claim is refuted by
Robert Barnes okay so Robert Barnes did
something useful
good to know
he's a Russian asset
all right
um
yeah I I would I guess I would
I'm gonna back barns on this that I'll
bet you a lot of the old quotes are in a
context or something or just made up
yeah the
all right
so that's all I got for you YouTubers
thanks for joining
uh
no no barns are still an idiot all right
bye for now YouTube see you tomorrow
