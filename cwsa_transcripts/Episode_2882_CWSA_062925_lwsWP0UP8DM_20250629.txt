there you are it's about time come on in
take off your coat run the air conditioning and we're going to have a show
it's going to be amazing
[Music]
good morning everyone and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take a chance on improving your mood this morning all you need for
that is a copper margar glass a tankered chelstein a canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your favorite liquid i like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better is called the simultaneous sip it happens now go
good all right i wonder
uh if there's any new science that would suggest that drinking coffee is good for
your health oh we hear something um there's new research from the Queen
Mary University of London that says that caffeine can improve your
cellular longevity and repair your DNA
and it activates your AMPK oh I feel my AMK being activated right
now i don't even know what it is but it's definitely activated
so yeah turns out that uh every time you sip with me you get a little bit younger
facts that's called science i wonder if there's any other science
that you didn't need to do because you could have just asked me well here's one
um apparently according to neuroscience news there's a ma massive new analysis
this this is so dumb this shows that exercise
is good for children
does that even seem real can you believe that in 2025
somebody apparently uh got some kind of funding to do
research to find out if exercise is good for children
guess what it's good for him
so specifically they're looking at anxiety and
depression and uh big surprise when children exercise they have less
anxiety and less depression yeah I think you could have saved a little bit of money on that one
just ask me all right here's another one this one's almost as
funny uh Stanford I saw this on a post by Clint Jarvis on
X uh Stanford paid 35,000 people to quit
social media and then they checked back with him later to see how happy they
were that they quit social media and got paid for it it turns out that they were
happier now again do you think there was any
chance that you were going to pay somebody to not look at their social media for a little bit and they were
going to come back and say "Oh no turns out I was I was very sad that I didn't
get to look at my social media." Oh and by the way there's something deeply
wrong with this kind of research because obviously
obviously the people in the research study were completely aware that the
reason they were being paid to quit social media is so that somebody could study what their mood was
if you did that with anything you would find a you know five or six%
improvement in mood you you could be like "All right we're going to remove
one of the chairs that you don't use at your kitchen table."
Well we don't even need that chair i know so you never use it so we're going
to remove it from the room and we're going to come back and we're going to Yeah after paying you to be allowed to
remove that chair and in a month we're going to measure whether you're in a better mood what do you think would
happen well based on everything I know about
scientific studying you would convince yourself that removing that share made you happier
because you would know that they were measuring whether you were happier and
that would be enough for some percentage of people to imagine they were happier
so if people know you're measuring their happiness before and after a thing I
believe there's there's even a name for this is it the tailor effect or is that
only for um there there's something like that for
business productivity if you're measuring the uh productivity in a business and you make any change
whatsoever productivity goes up have you ever heard that so if he said
"I'm going to study whether changing the light bulbs increases productivity
as Oh the Hawthorne effect." Exactly thank you yeah the Hawthorne effect
if people know you're studying it they they just sort of turn into that thing
so watch out for that the Hawthorne effect
um according to a post on X by the world of statistics
the average US adult wakes up in a bad mood 300 times a year
how many of you wake up in a bad mood almost every single day
i didn't even know that was a thing do you know how many times I've awakened in a bad mood in my entire life
awakened in a bad mood not once not a single time
did you ever see some kind of a problem that you know a lot of people have
and you say to yourself "Oh thank God I don't have that one." You know like like
if you had some strange I don't know fetish or something illegal or you know
you were drug addicted or something and you say to yourself "Oh you know I got a
lot of problems but thank God I don't have that one." But when I look at this
that the average US adult wakes up in a bad mood 300 times a year and I've never
once in my whole life
up i love the morning the first four or five hours of my morning
excellent every single day of my entire life that I can recall
so I got problems you probably heard of a few you know like you know terminal
illness stuff like that but uh I don't have that one so by the way if you
haven't heard the update I'm on uh for my terminal cancer problem that was uh
likely to end me this month that's what I thought um you want to know a secret
here's a little secret in California um you have the right to end your own
existence if you have a terminal illness and get a couple of doctors to certify
it and all that and I was in that situation
meaning that I'm officially terminal i've got two doctors to certify it i've
done the paperwork um I've even ordered I've even ordered the medicine
that you eventually drank to to end your life but that was based on the fact that
in the month of May I was absolutely
whacked with pain i mean I had pain like I've never felt before all over my body
and so uh I had sort of internally planned you know but wasn't telling the
world that uh I needed to get past my stepdaughter's wedding and reception and
then
to end my life guess when basically today
today was the day I was planning literally to take my own life today at
the end of uh you know it might be tomorrow but at but the end of June but
what happened instead is that I started taking some um hormone blockers they
block your testosterone and the cancer needs the testosterone to
eat so completely surprising me I didn't
realize that that would also remove all of my pain so you know last night I'm swimming in
my pool and uh yeah playing pingpong and walking around i have no pain no pain
anywhere in fact I don't have any real symptoms
you know my my legs are a little bit uh uh a little bit wobbly because um I
couldn't walk for about five months at least not much i could hobble a
little bit but uh at the moment my uh my
PSA levels have dropped 90% in just a few weeks so just a few weeks
after taking this very expensive new uh testosterone blockers the uh the number
one indicator of how you're doing and how long you're going to last if you have if you have prostate cancer that's
metastasized as I do um that PSA number is like the big one
so it dropped 90% i mean it was through the roof and it was still way too high
but it was going to be today
so do I feel like I'm on a borrowed time got a little extra oh hell I do
absolutely and you know what arcing back to our earlier conversation
even with terminal cancer that I thought was going to end me with you know within a few
weeks I still never woke up in a bad mood not once i just wake up feeling
good you know even with pain I would still be in a good mood i would just be in pain anyway
so that's the update i don't know how long it'll last but it would be within
the realm of possibility that you know it could add a year or two
and maybe by then something else comes up you never know but the uh the drug
I'm on is known not to work long term so it's meant it's usually two or three
years and then your body acclimates to the drug and then it stops working
so I don't have a plan for after that but at the moment
looks like I got some uh I got some borrowed time anyway so that's the
update for that um Trump is blasting the what he calls the fake news media for
suggesting that he had some kind of plan to give Iran $30 billion to restart
their domestic nuclear power program and uh Trump wants you to know that that
never has been real um but the news was not that Trump was going to do it and
Newsmax is talking about this um the news was that
the there were some other countries that might be willing to be part of that so
not that the US was ever going to give any money to Iran so it's fake news
kind of so you know how you and everybody else
in the world said uh if all the businesses are moving out of these big
buildings but yet rents are too high for individuals who want to you know just
have a living space isn't the most obvious fix that you convert some of the
empty office space like in New York City there's lots of it that you convert it
into living space and then rents will go down because you know there's a greater supply compared to the demand etc but
that was never economical or even close um however according to the Wall Street
Journal Carol Ryan is writing that there have been some recent developments
that have made that now economical so in New York City there are actually office
buildings that are successfully being turned into residential
Well what changed well apparently New York City has some kind of a uh law now
that if you do that if you change your business space into um residential
you get a 90% property tax exemption for up to 35 years holy cow
that's pretty darn good um and then let's see Carol Ryan writes that around
16% of New York City office um offices are empty
um versus 1.4% of apartments so there's a lot more empty office space than there
is empty residential which you know tells you about your demand your supply
and demand there and what's happened is a lot of the owners of the office
buildings were kind of optimistically holding on
they knew their building was empty but they were kind of thinking well maybe
it's only a year and then people will come back and we'll be glad we held on to it but uh now enough time has gone by
that people who own those buildings for a variety of reasons are saying um all
right we're going to let it go for pennies on a dollar so the new developer
can buy a building for 20 cents on the dollar uh convert it to residential
and then have this property tax exemption for 35 years so suddenly it
looks like a good deal there's only one thing that could turn this into a bad deal again do you know what it is what's
the one thing that could turn that into a bad deal
a socialist mayor so apparently the the rent control and
the socialist mayor would once again make it could could not guaranteed but
could make it uneconomical to to to create all this new residential
property that would have been lower in cost so
there's your socialist mayor situation for today all right
so you know I've been speculating that Iran's supreme leader whose name is
either Kab or Kab or something like that um I've told you
that I don't believe he's still in charge reasons being he's 86
he probably got put in a bunker for his own protection during the Israel attack
and they probably took his phone away for his own protection during the same
time and probably it was the military who was in control of keeping him safe
which means that his closest civilian advisors and supporters wouldn't even
have access to him they wouldn't be able to call him they wouldn't be able to see him because he'd be in the bunker now
under that situation I speculated that it would be a very small small effort to
simply pretend the supreme leader was in charge but for the military leader to
actually be in charge because if the supreme leader says tell everybody I
want to attack Israel the military leader can say sure I'll take care of it and just never do it so
so then uh Kam did that video which was sort of generic it's like oh we won the
war and really didn't say much and that was supposed to prove he was
still alive and running the country but I was not convinced and then today
there's a new post on Acts and I'm going to read the translation to you so it was
posted in Farsy but Grock gives me the translation and you tell me if this
sounds like the the tone and the vibe of a supreme leader who just went through a
terrible war does this sound like him all right here's the post the Iranian
nation should know that the reason for the opposition to America is that they
want Iran to surrender and this is a great insult to the Iranian nation by
the Americans and such a thing will never happen does that sound like him
it doesn't does it now it sounds like you know something in
the same sort of domain a little bit but I've
read enough of the exposts from you know when the Supreme Leader was presumably
actually in charge and he doesn't sound like that um I believe that if you ran a
um some kind of a writing analysis you know in Farsy you wouldn't want to do it
on the um interpretation you want to do it on the original but if you use AI to
look at his prior posts and then just analyze the writing style and then look
at this one I don't see it this is a different writing style this looks very much like
somebody else wrote him a little post there so I'm going to I'm going to double down
on my prediction that the Supreme Leader is not the Supreme Leader and that that
probably has something to do with what the ceasefire is holding because the crazy old 86 year old leader
probably would have never surrendered but he gets to say this you know on acts
where nobody cares well apparently a congressman named Eric
Berles was uh is being credited for saying that
Trump was briefed on some kind of alien encounters and how many different types
of aliens are walking the earth even now but Berles says that never happened
so just know that there's new flare up of aliens we got aliens they're all over
the place they're walking among us some of them allegedly are tall Nordic
looking aliens some are little grays and some are human hybrids
but uh none of this story is true so it's not true that they exist that's
just me saying that and it's not true that the president was briefed by this
congressman about it so none of that's true well did any of you see Michael Bernish
on CNN talking about Trump's uh first six months on the job
well I've told you a number of times that um Merkish is the most unbiased
person um on CNN yeah which is why they only give him one show a week he can
only have one show a week because he's too unbiased and he decided uh yesterday I guess it
was to do a what was a six-inute um description of all the wins that
Trump has had that are impressive now if I told you that CNN was talking
about all the wins that Trump had would you think that the list would be long
you would not expect that would you but his list was pretty long i'll tell you about it would you expect that when he
was done talking about all the wonderful things that Trump has done that that
that would be sort of the end of the segment or would you expect that they would say "But he's becoming an
authoritarian dictator Hitler so even though he got some wins the country is
in terrible shape and we're all going to die." Wouldn't you expect that from the
regular CNN coverage or MSNBC well
didn't do that he just told you all the things that Trump got right and that
includes the Iran Israel ceasefire bringing the border crossings down to
basically zero inflation being under control whole bunch of companies
bringing investments in Central America for manufacturing real wage growth for bluecollar workers increased more than
it has I guess in a long time nato funding going from barely 2% to 5% to
which probably protects us quite a bit if they're spending more on their defense trade deals with China maybe
India pretty soon and then the Supreme Court wins and I may have left out some stuff
but that's really big if the only thing that Trump got right
was the things as Mirkanes mentioned and he and he got all that done in 6 months
and that's not even counting you know brokering the Republic of the Congo
Congo versus Rwanda war he ended a one of the biggest wars in the world and
that was just sort of a you know a sidebar for what he's been up to in the last six months oh my god so I give
credit to Smirkish for telling the truth which he does i mean
that's that's his norm um but CNN allowed him to air it and uh to me that
feels like a big deal anyway um and the uh White House has issued a holiday
fuelpriced reminder that apparently according Newsmax is reporting this but
according to the White House gas will be the cheapest for Fourth of July
uh since 2021 now you might say but but that's just
the White House saying that but apparently the data supports that it will be the on average your your state
might differ but on average cheapest gas prices since 2021
that wasn't even on Smirkish's list
which was also solved So I guess I guess inflation covers gas
and eggs but we talked so much about gas and eggs that it feels like that's worth
a separate call out he solved eggs he solved gas
all right but the good news keeps on coming um
there's a story on O brooke Mallerie is writing about this that uh there's this
chief economist called Torsten Sluck who apparently had uh originally said bad
things about um Trump's tariff plan and uh like many economists said that
Trump's tariff plans this would have been a few months ago before we knew what was going to happen were bad for
the economy and he has now done a 180 and He's he's called a leading Wall
Street economist and he now admits that the that Trump
may have quote outsmarted all of us with his trade policies
um he acknowledged that you know the uncertainty was maybe bad for the economy temporarily but uh at the moment
things look a lot more let's say transparent and we've got a much better
idea where things are going or how bad it can get and it sort of looks like
according to this uh highly respected Wall Street economist he thinks that
everything is going to fine with the tariffs and it might produce $400
billion of annual revenue for US taxpayers
although they might be eating some of that um because the tariffs are paid by the US company that's doing the
importing but if the US company doing the importing says "I'm not going to buy
your high price stuff i might go somewhere else then the foreign entity that's um that's providing it might have
to say "No no no don't look at Vietnam um we'll just lower our price you know
you ease some of it we'll ease some of it and we'll both stay in business." So it's probably you know a combination but
it would add 400 billion to annual revenues wow that's pretty amazing if true
then as if things weren't good enough uh N gadget is reporting that uh Trump is
reportedly u getting ready for a bunch of new executive orders to make it easier to do
AI and I think these orders have something to do more to do with power
generation uh but it might be bigger than that um
so it's an AI action plan so it's more than more than just energy production
but he but it will be removing some regulations and red tape that would stop
AI and stop energy production for the AI data centers so Reuters is reporting
this um and it would quote make it easier for
power generating projects to connect to the grid so that could be a big deal
um so that's how Trump is doing trump is doing so well that even one of the main
people on CNN is praising him and he ran out of time to mention all the good
things that are happening he just ran out of time it's not like he he ran out
of examples he just ran out of time because they don't have all day to talk about it
but how is how how are the Democrats doing well let's uh let's check in with
the Democrats so according to the Washington Free
Beacon the uh a lot of the California Democrat donors are uh having a tough
time because they're looking at a possibility of Kla Harris running for governor
and you know what they think of Kla Harris running for governor the people who donate the most money well it's been
called quote a complete storm and they're they're giving with a cold
shoulder and donors are telling Politico that
Eris's 2024 campaign for president was quote pathetic and traumatizing
it was traumatizing um so that so those are the people who
were on her team that the people on her own side are calling her pathetic and traumatizing
um and somebody else said these are all anonymous of course just reminds you uh we are in this
complete storm a California Democrat who had contributed a bunch of money said um
it said quote with Biden we got bamboozled i think Harris did the best
she could in that situation but obviously she knew about the cognitive decline too uh I've written so many
checks because I knew the Trump administration would be horrible but we've lived in a nightmare because of
Democrats i'm furious at them truly all right what exactly is the Trump
nightmare that they're talking about is there a reason that
hasn't heard about the nightmare you're experiencing how many of you are experiencing a
nightmare have you been shipped off to El Salvador
did somebody knock on your door in the middle of the night and ship you off did
somebody raise your taxes or become an authoritarian leader is there something
happening I don't know about other than the national debt which of
course would have been a tragedy no matter who is in charge um
how long can they keep how long can they keep going with the idea that we're
living in some kind of a hellscape when there's no evidence of it
now I do get that there would be you know individual people with you know individual situations where some funding
gets cut and it has an effect on them i'm not minimizing that but if you to
look at the average you know just how the country is doing sort of in general
you know not saying there aren't problems i'm not saying that the government's you know decisions and
policies haven't you know created a burden on some people that they didn't have before but on average
do do you think other countries are looking at the United States and saying "Oh look at that hellscape."
I don't think so i think they wish they were us so it's
amazing that they can keep that fantasy in their head that somehow we're we're surviving this horrendous
Trump situation when I don't feel it i
don't feel it at all i mean it's not just that I'm biased and that I like the
things that his administration is doing in general you know maybe not everything
but I feel like I would see it even if the pain were largely on other people
like you would notice it wouldn't you i don't really notice it so we'll see
um in the weirdest news Axios is reporting that uh Trump is pressuring
Israel to stop the uh what I guess he would think is lawfare against Benjamin
Netanyahu so Netanyahu is standing trial and I
guess this is going on for years now because he keeps uh postponing stuff um
he was he was being charged with allegedly accepting more than $200,000
in gifts from wealthy businessmen and granting regulatory benefits worth
hundreds of millions of dollars to a telecom tycoon and tycoon in exchange
for favorable news coverage now I don't know about the evidence for
any of that stuff but apparently Trump is threatening
that uh American funding for Israel could be cut if they keep going after
Netanyahu through the courts to which I say really
is the American president really trying to strongarm the judicial system in Israel
like right in public while we're watching and is that going to work
would that work the the thing that's amazing is not that
he's trying to do it you know cuz Trump's pretty unpredictable and he he he tries things that we think are
impossible but realistically he's doing this as
publicly as you possibly could do you think Israel is going to say "Well you
know it's been four years and we got all this evidence and we really would like to get a decision but now that we know
that Trump doesn't want it to happen and he might he might put some pressure on funding for Israel uh we've decided just
to drop the case." Is that even a little bit possible
does anybody think that might happen because it doesn't feel like something that could happen in the world I live in
but it you know but I'm also open to Trump doing the Kobayashi Maru you know
as in the thing that nobody thought was possible maybe
how many of you think that Trump could make a difference in the Israeli
judicial system trial of Netanyahu just because he doesn't want it to
happen does that sound even a little bit real
so it's a puzzling story and it also makes you wonder why Trump is that
invested now I know he's had a good working experience with Netanyahu and Netanyahu
seems to be willing to give Trump maximum credit but is that why
or do you think do you think there's some other agreement or understanding or
maybe there's something else he wants to accomplish because Trump would love Let me let me
just speculate all right this is just speculation so Trump is probably pushing hard to get
a relatively rapid uh agreement on Gaza
don't you think it it seems reasonable to me to assume that he's pushing Israel
to give something like a peace deal with for Gaza
now maybe Trump thinks that the only way he can get that done soon is with
Netanyahu and that would be you know reason enough to try to keep him in office I suppose
and but but do you think that's what's going on because if Trump gets a good result
with Iran and then he were to let's say in just a few weeks get something like a
ceasefire in Gaza with you know some framework of how to how to go forward
there that would make Trump unambiguously
a candidate for the for the Nobel Peace Prize
but more importantly he would go down in history as one of the and maybe he already will one of the most effective
presidents of all time so it could be that Trump is just trying to roll up the
wins and he's got so many wins and so many more that he could get that he
really wants this Gaza thing and wants it fast and I've told you before that
winning fixes a lot of stuff
so if Trump gets a bunch of wins that everybody sees as wins you know even the
Democrats say stuff like "Well he did get that ceasefire." Well I have to
admit he did close the border well okay inflation does look pretty good so he's
doing a bunch of stuff that it would be hard to criticize even if he were the
biggest critic but if he pulls in Gaza and gets something that looks even a
little bit like it's you know let's say uh
successful oh my goodness his uh his legacy will be
in really good shape we don't know what's going to happen for the next three and a half years but wow that
would be the best six months any president ever had anyway
let's talk about the one big beautiful bill so I like most of you do not understand
the all the processes in the Congress and Senate but apparently the Senate has
voted to move along the big beautiful bill um
but why is that not the end of it how many how many times do they vote to
move it forward in the Senate can't they just vote for it
wh why is there more than one vote e either you're for it or against it but
I don't know how this works but it's simply simply there was a vote
and I think they only managed to be like one vote extra
um they moved to move it along does anybody even know what that means
so it's it's not passed it's just sort of moved along to the next stage and
they did a vote on it i guess Rand Paul and uh
uh one other person said no on it
um so I I went to uh Grock to try to figure out what's in the big beautiful
bill because I I first of all wondered how many topics are there
and there are something like um 25 topics
meaning separate you know budgetary policy changes and
then within the topics you know there might be several things that happen so
we're talking about I don't know a hundred different things
how many of those could you describe not too many not too many
um and then I was trying to understand what's happening with Medicaid
so Medicaid is what the states are spending on people who can't afford their own insurance I guess
so let me read what Grock said about just one of the changes to Medicaid see
if you can follow this so apparently what's happening is the
Republicans were looking for a way to cut the budget which would necessarily mean cutting
Medicaid because that's a big part of the budget um but make it look like
they're not cutting the budget so they can say we didn't do anything to Medicaid
so they're coming up with it it sounds like some real weasel ways to do it
so listen to this the Senate bill proposes reducing the state imposed tax
on Medicaid providers um that would be like hospitals and nursing homes so states are already
taxing those providers and the federal bill would lower their
taxes from like 6% to around 3% now first of all why does the federal
government get to tell the states what they can and cannot tax in their own
state isn't that totally nonobvious that the federal
government could tell them to not tax as much how is that even legal
now why do you think they would do that why would the federal government tell
the states to tax their own citizens less
well there's a reason for that apparently the existing law says that
the feds will match whatever money is raised by the state
so if they can force the state to to raise less money for their own
Medicaid from their own state then the federal government won't have
to match it is that what you wanted your senators to do for you to strongarm the states to
 their money raising ability for Medicaid so that they would have an
excuse when they matched it to say we didn't cut anything i don't know what you're talking about the states cut
things oh the states cut the taxes no that wasn't us all we do is match we're
we're just matching what the states do yeah we didn't cut anything you
liars you just weasle pieces of
this is not what anybody's paying you to do now I get how clever it is but when
you're listening to your favorite Republican tell you that they're not cutting Medicaid they're just
lying they're just lying they're cutting Medicaid now they're also cuts
to take away Medicaid for non-citizens
now you might say to me "But Scott that part I like." And you might you might
like that but this other matching funds thing that is so sketchy like and this
just happens to be the one thing I chose to look at i didn't look at you know all the other 24 things are they all like
this are they all just weasel crap
they they can't just cut a budget and say "Sorry we don't have any money we'll just have to cut the budget everybody
will have to make do." Oh man uh it was Tom Tillis who was the one who
voted against it with Rand pole so then Senator Schumer decides that you
know now that the Republicans have something that's close to um a positive vote that he's going to use his
persuasion skills to argue against it now if you've been listening to me for a
while you know that Chuck Schumer has no persuasion skills
he is completely pathetic when it comes to all things persuasion i mean he's
really bad as bad as I've ever seen i don't know if I've ever seen anybody worse honestly so what would you do if
you wanted to argue against it well here's what Chuck Schumer comes up with
he says "I objected and I objected to stop Republicans moving forward on their
big ugly bill until they read every single word of it to the American people."
So he said he was going to force the chamber to read it out loud
so last I check um the staff had been reading for 9
hours so now it would have been 10 or 11 hours so they're having the lower level
staff literally read the bill out loud where they're just monotoning it and
then the will and then page three
blah blah so nobody's listening to it and it's not really the senators who
were in charge anyway it's just staffers reading it but now Schumer thinks he's
got the win because he made them read it to the American public nobody listened
and if they listened would they have understood like that Medicaid matching
you matching dollar amount trick this is completely useless
and um this this is also typical of Schumer
instead of coming up with better policy ideas and saying you know if it were our
bill we would have done this instead of this and this instead of this he can't
do that instead he has to he has to um complain about the process now to be
fair um you know Ran Paul and Thomas Massie
and lots of people complain complain about the process the process of
something gets dumped on the Congress or dumped on the public with no time to review it that's a fair that's a fair
criticism because it comes from both sides but if he's focusing on the process he
is losing would you agree if if your job is to you know persuade
for your side the Democrats going after the process just sort of
never works cuz people aren't really invested in the process
that you know we it's not what motivates us like you don't hear oh they should
have given them more time and you're like oh I'm going to go to the streets
it doesn't activate anybody you just go "Oh that's a stupid system." And then
you're kind of done with it so he talks about trying to stop Trump and stop the
Republicans and he talks about the process but he adds nothing
he doesn't tell you what they would do that's better completely empty
resistance so that won't change anything um over on CNBC
um there was a uh Bitcoin guy a big advisor financial advisor Rick Edelman
who uh thinks that people should hold 10 to 40% of their investments in
cryptocurrencies does that seem a little high to you he says the the old way of having 60% of
your portfolio in stocks and 40% in bonds that just doesn't work anymore
partly because people live too long so if you didn't have your money in stocks
uh you wouldn't make enough to you know last that long uh but now he's saying
that 10 to 40% of your total portfolio should be in cryptocurrencies
now I don't give financial advice um but 40% looks high
so maybe I did maybe I just gave you some financial advice but uh it's not advice that's just And
uh it's more like a reaction or a feeling 10% does seem like the minimum
because I don't know what your US dollar will be worth or what your house will be worth but in all likelihood
Bitcoin will keep churning along not guaranteed if we're guaranteed I'd say put 100% in Bitcoin but at least 10%
um so think about that don't take my advice because I'm not a financial
advisor um and if you did you probably feel sorry for it but if you were going
to do your own research and talk to your AIS and your financial advisors I would ask them what
percentage should be in cryptocurrencies specifically probably Bitcoin
and they may have some advice for you but don't take my advice
all right Tom Fenton over at Judicial Watch uh I saw a video of him talking
about the the story you've already heard that allegedly the FBI was aware of a
plot uh in which China was allegedly two
allegedly in this um trying to influence the 2024 election with fake voter
ballots now in order to get those fake votive ballots allegedly they were going
to use fake driver's licenses um and then that would allow them to get the
fake ballots and then allegedly presumably they would make those votes for Biden
because they had some allegedly possibly
um some blackmail over him because of Hunter Biden's you know activities in
China and getting money from China so then as the story goes uh and Tom
Fenton reminds us the FBI according to Cash Patel the FBI decided not only to
drop it but also to tell people to delete references to it on their
computers now I don't know how often they do that does it happen often that the FBI will
say "We've got these allegations we need to look into." then later follow up with
"Uh not only is it not real but we want you to delete it from your devices."
Is that common i've never heard of that in any other
context but maybe it's something they do in the FBI i don't know but as Tom
Fitton points out the FBI was aware that there was some
confirmatory evidence which is that uh I guess the FBI or at least law
enforcement uh found 20,000 fake US drivers licenses that did seem to come
from China now do you think that it's a coincidence
that China had 20,000 fake driver's licenses and there was also an alleged plot to
use driver's licenses to get fake ballots do you think that these two are
connected because they might not be and it seems like it would be the biggest
story in the world if we knew for sure that these were connected but boy does it feel like they're
connected but I would say probably it's just short
of being so confirmed that you just treat it as a fact so I'm not yet not
yet going to treat it as a fact but boy is I heading in that direction
next do you remember when um was either
Project Veritas or OMG uh had the producer from CNN saying that
they're they were going to pivot to talking non-stop about climate change do you remember that and that it was a you
know a corporate decision that they would just nail this climate change stuff all day long
and then I don't see it do you do you see CNN andor MSNBC
talking non-stop about climate change i feel like
they're giving up on it they still do mention it so it's hasn't gone to zero
but usually it'd be like a guest mentions it in passing
i feel like the news business has finally given up on climate change
because I I of course am in a bubble so I see the things that people send to me
i don't see the things that people don't send to me and I don't notice on my own
but it seems to me that there's an awful lot of evidence including the Washington Post saying that the temperature has
norm has fluctuated for all of Earth's history with or without people
and then the uh you know there's stuff like the ice is not as bad as you thought it would and the the the water
levels don't seem to have risen and the storms don't see as seem as bad as they predicted
and while it does seem like maybe the temperatures are going up
it's not as obvious that that's bad for anything it might be good that it goes
up a little bit so does it seem to you like climate
change hasn't gone away but that the people who were promoting
it have lost confidence in their own story
they might still think it might be true or even probably true but now that we've
watched you know the complete destruction of all scientific
um I think even Democrats are saying to themselves you know what we've been lied
to quite a few times and the lies always look like this this being climate change
it always looks like that do you think they've noticed
uh well I like to end any climate change conversation or post by saying the
following wait till they find out about climate models
oh oh wait till they find out there will be whistleblowers
there will be people who do the climate models to say "Okay I I got to confess i
could make these models do anything I wanted just by changing my assumptions
which they can so that's coming I predict
um so I guess Maria Bartoma
uh is uh interviewing Trump probably right now while I'm talking but u there
was a teaser for that interview in which uh Maria asked Trump um does he think
that Iran might have hid some of the uranium before the attacks on Ford and
the other sites trump says no that they did not have
time or ability to move those the uranium because he says it's first of
all it's hard to move and it is heavy and I said to myself it's heavy how
heavy is it that you can't move it um there an estimate that they may have 800
lb of enriched uranium yeah it might be buried at this point but the estimate
was at At one point they had 800 lb and I say to myself is it really hard to move 800 lb
and it's not like it's not like all 800 lb is in one big barrel right
it would be a number of different containers each of them with I don't know if I had to guess 50 to 100 pounds
a piece but there would be you know multiple containers are you telling me
that the entire nation of Iran can't figure out how to move 800 cumulative pounds when it's in 50 to 100 pound um
units and there's no such thing as a truck that can handle 100 pounds
even if they didn't move all of it wouldn't they take the stuff that was you know 60 enriched to 60 say "All
right well that's not 800 lb that's only 100 lb but we'll take that 100 lb cuz
that that's what you would build a bomb from and the fact that we did not see them
move I don't know what that's worth because there must be things that they do that
we don't see and then Trump said that they wouldn't have had notice
but of course they had notice they didn't they didn't know the exact day that Ford out was going to get taken
out but they knew that was the you know it was like the main theme of the war so
of course they knew it was coming so I would say it was movable they did have
notice they did have time they did have the ability um
but did they did they do anything with it remember I guess it was yesterday I
was telling you there was a news story that I thought was low credibility
that said that Iran had offered to give up their uranium to other countries in
return for yellow cake that they could use for domestic nuclear power and I
said I don't know i don't trust that story low credibility well I haven't
seen any confirmation that Iran says they still have any uranium so I'm going
to say that that story was almost certainly fake almost certainly fake
anyway so I uh I'm impressed by the military
i'm impressed by Trump i think the operation that the US did to take out
Fordau and the other sites was amazing and as successful as you could possibly
be when you have specific targets the only open question is did Iran do
something that we don't know about trump says almost certainly no
and I say I don't know maybe but I do I do agree with Trump that if
they decided to you know go hard at reinvigorating their nuclear program
that we would know and Trump says he would absolutely quote
absolutely bomb Iran again if uh if needed
so even if they had some uranium what are the odds that they would try to
weaponize it i would say it would be a really bad bet at this point to try so I think Trump
probably did get a good outcome um but we don't know nothing's 100% in
this world but probably i would say the odds are very good that
he got a lasting outcome we'll see well RFK Jr is talking about how uh teen
boys today have lower testosterone than their grandfathers so this is what uh RFK Jr said recently
you've heard this before but it's shocking every time I hear it he said uh when my uncle was president we spent
zero on chronic disease in this country spend zero meaning that it just we
didn't have much he said "Today we spend 1.7 trillion and rising
and and the expenses rising faster than our econ faster than our economy." He
says it's an existential threat to our country in every way 75% of American
kids cannot qualify for military service
what 75% what was it when I was a kid if I had to
guess you know just sort of thinking about my classmates and stuff I would
guess that 75% would qualify and maybe only 25% wouldn't but now it's reversed
75% of kids would not qualify for military service holy
moly and fertility rates are plummeting as you know and uh according to RFK Jr who
certainly has looked into it he says that American boys have half of the testosterone
of a 65year-old man and half the sperm count
what half holy moly
so I guess my testosterone blockers are just uh ahead of the game
all right people that's uh all I got for today um another amazing Sunday show the
best thing that happened to you today so far uh I'm going to say some words to my
beloved um beloved subscribers on locals and the
rest of you i hope I will see you tomorrow same time same place for more
of this because it's good every time
