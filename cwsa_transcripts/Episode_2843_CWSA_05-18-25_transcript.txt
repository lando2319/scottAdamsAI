Not me and not you
either. So, let's get our comments
working
here and then we'll have some
[Music]
fun. Good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization.
It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time. But if
you'd like to try to take your
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains, all you need is a copper
mug or a glass of
tankerstein, a candy jug or flask, a
vessel of any kind. Fill it with your
favorite liquid. I like coffee. And join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine hit of the day. The thing
that makes everything better is called a
simultaneous sip. And it happens now.
Go. That was
sastic. Well, it's Sunday and uh usually
this happens on Saturday, but today Owen
Gregorian will be hosting a spaces uh
right after the show. spaces is the
audio service that's on the X platform.
So, so if you want to listen to that, go
to X, look for Owen Gregorian. Uh, or
you can see the link in my in my
feed. Well, I wonder if there's any
science that they didn't need to do
because they could have just asked me.
Oh, here's some. Eric Nolan writing
inpost. He's my favorite. Did you know
that people who inhaled DMT
uh they got rapid and lasting
anti-depressant
effects? Do you know how I knew that
that was going to be true? Because every
single time they try a hallucinogen, it
doesn't matter which one, and they test
it on depressed people, every single
time it works.
And not only does it work, it has a
lasting benefits. Maybe not lifetime,
but lasting. So maybe they didn't need
to test this. Maybe they could have just
asked me, "Hey, what do you think would
happen if we give this depressed guy
some DMT?" I'd be like, "Well, I think
he'll get
happier." That's what I
think. You probably saw some of the news
that a uh a Mexican naval vessel crashed
into the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday night.
Now, the surprising part about this
story is Mexico has a
navy. How many of you knew that Mexico
even had a navy? Do they? Well, I guess
they do. Uh this particular ship was a
tall ship. So, a sail ship with very
tall sails. And I guess those sails were
too tall, but I think there was some
kind of engine problem or something that
caused them to smash into the bridge. I
saw that there were uh casualties, but
then uh I saw some other
reports. So, I'm not I'm not sure
exactly how many casualties, but they do
have I think most likely they
do. Um so, that was bad. In a related
story,
uh, Red State Ward Clark is writing
that, uh, the Mexican
cartels are now dealing in the illicit
fish trade. So, they're becoming
fishermen and they're squeezing out the
non-cartel people and uh, you know,
elbowing their way in and they're in the
fish business. Now, this raises some
questions.
Why is it that they're in the fish
business? Is it because selling fish is
as profitable as
cocaine? I don't think so. I don't think
the margins are nearly as good. Is
it Is it
because they have so many recruits who
want to join the cartel that they don't
have enough cocaine to keep them all
busy? It's like, "All right, all right."
You know, only the people with seniority
get to do the cocaine. Um, we're going
to have to put you on something, you
know, sort of an entrylevel thing. All
right. Okay. Excellent. I got my
tattoos. I'm ready to go. What kind of
exciting criminal activity will I be
involved in? Well, Juan, uh, we're going
to put you in
fish. Excuse me. Fish. You'll be in
fish. Um, I didn't join the cartel
to be in fish. I know, but got to start
somewhere. If you do a good job in fish,
we'll move you to uh, I don't know what,
stealing cars. But eventually, you could
work your way up to the cocaine
business. But
seriously, doesn't it seem to you that
this is driven by too many people in the
cartel? like would they really enter the
fish business unless they had more
people than they had jobs for the
people? Watching the cartels uh
diversify, it it's telling us something,
but I know don't know exactly what it
is. Now, I guess you could say that the
cartels are just taking over every
business in Mexico and fish are just one
of them. I suppose that's true.
Well, there's a company I've told you
about before, and I even wrote about it
in one of my books called Clim Works,
and it's these uh giant sucking machines
that suck the CO2 out of the air. Oh no,
they'll take all my CO2, and my plants
will die. Don't they know that CO2 is
plant food? I just said that so you
don't have to. Um, but the idea was they
were trying to reduce the risk of
climate change by by having gigantic
machines that suck the CO2 out. But now
that they've been running these machines
for a while, uh, turns out that the
machines add more CO2 to
the It adds more CO2 than it
removes. You You can't You can't fail
harder than that.
I'm sorry, Climb Works. I really thought
you had a chance, but uh no, turns out
that they're not that efficient and uh
it just makes things worse. Or or if you
like your CO2 because it's good for
plant food, makes things better. It it
would be funny if you learned that the
plants were growing really well wherever
there was a climworks
machine because they had added more CO2
than they'd removed from the atmosphere.
It does it seem to you that every
climate change story
now looks
different. Is it my imagination or is
climate change sort of as a concept now
so debunked that whenever there's a
story it's about something not working
or you know some some estimate that
wasn't true or some variable that they
forgot there's something definitely
happening in the climate change
[Music]
world and uh I like to end this by
saying wait till you find out about the
climate models cuz you know you we live
in a world where everything from the
auto pen which we'll talk about to the
Mexican
navy literally just nothing works. But
we're supposed to believe that these
complicated models uh predicting the
climate for 40 years we're supposed to
believe that those are accurate.
Oh
my.
Anyway, according to live science, uh,
one of the problems with AI models is
they can't read, uh, they can't tell
time or read a calendar. Now, I guess
they can tell time if they do it the
digital way. But if you show AI a
picture of a
clock, it can't tell you what time it
is. Isn't that weird? You think it would
be able to do that easily, but and the
same with a
calendar. So, it's not that it doesn't
understand time and calendars, but if
you show it a picture of one, it gets
confused and it's really terrible. The
failure rate is uh, you know, like 40%
25% in that range.
Well, here's some possibly good news
until it turns out to be yet another
thing that doesn't work. According to
interesting engineering, there's a
European firm that's going to use
nuclear waste to generate their own
nuclear power plant and they're going to
have power for a quarter million homes.
It's a company called
Thorizon. Now, you knew that this was a
potential technology. It's something
I've been talking about for years. Um
well, other people have been talking
about it and I've been telling you about
it, but uh the idea is that um nuclear
waste still has 90% of its potential for
power. Um but they don't have machines
that can use the extra
90%. So there's a there's a new kind of
machine. I think it's
uh true. What kind of technology? It's
one that you've heard of before.
Uh it's a molden salt
reactor. So, they haven't built it yet,
but they got the funding. They got the
plans. They're going to build it. And
uh this should be amazing. It would
power a quarter million households for
40 years with nuclear waste.
So, you know how we worried about
nuclear waste when I was a kid? Like,
that was the biggest thing people
worried about. Where are we going to put
all that nuclear waste? Well, if this
thing works, and I I'm pretty sure it
will. Um, it turns out that nuclear
waste is just your fuel for your
thorium. Is it thorium?
It's probably Thorium
because the name of the company is
Thorizon. I thought I said that
somewhere but I'm looking at my
notes. Yeah, I think it's A
Thorium. Well, um, Vive Ramaswami's bid
to become governor of Ohio is looking a
little more likely according to the
Daily Wire. the the only person who is
maybe going to give him a good fight for
the nomination on the Republican side
has dropped out and uh that gives him a
clear path to be the Republican
nominee. So he's got a little
competition but nothing that would stop
him. So Vav Rama Swami is one step
closer to being the governor of
Ohio. So that's in case you're wondering
why he's been so
quiet, that's why he's going to be
governor of Ohio. Do you think after
he's governor of
Ohio that uh he'll make a bid for the
presidency? I'm going to say yes.
I don't know if he'll do, you know, one
or two terms as governor, but seems like
that will be his preparation for for
running for president. I think it's
coming. Well, as you know, uh you may
have seen this if you're on social
media. Trump posted a video
uh that's a compilation of some of the
mysterious deaths that are uh linked to
Hillary Clinton.
Now, every time I think that Trump can't
be funnier or or he can't be more
provocative, he finds a way to do it.
So, you're probably aware that people
have put together these lists of all
these people who had mysterious deaths
that
were suspiciously good for Hillary
Clinton. That's what people say. Now, it
makes me wonder, could you could you
pick any random highlevel politician and
find a bunch of deaths that you could
argue, well, arguably this was good for
that politician, so they must have been
behind it. Or is this unique to
her? Because if it's if it's nothing but
coincidence, you would think there would
be at least one other notable
politician that also has just by
coincidence, you know, a whole bunch of
people who died that were related to
them and their death somehow was a
benefit to
them. But I only know about one.
I've never even heard of anyone else
being accused of having a whole bunch of
dead people around them that were
suspiciously good for them
career-wise. So, Trump
um prints that. Now, one of one of the
ones, just so you
know, do you remember when uh JFK Jr.
died in his plane
crash
and a lot of people said he likely was
going to run for the Senate in New York
and he might have been the only person
who could have beaten Clinton and then
the only person who could beat her
suspiciously dies in a plane
crash.
Interesting. Um, so that was one of
them, but there were a bunch of them.
Let's see. There was uh Seth Rich, uh
Vince
Foster, some intern Mary Mahoney, and
some others. So, I was reading about
this in the Gateway Pundit. So, why do
you think Trump did that? What What do
you think his motivation was for
printing
that? Well, I would say at least two
possibilities.
One is that it just absorbs attention
and it's going to make people just think
about that instead of thinking about
other things. And as long as you're
thinking about the thing he wants you to
think about, you don't have enough time
to think about maybe things that would
be negative to him. So the more he makes
you think what he wants you to
think, the better off he is.
So, we'll see. Um, I don't have an
opinion about how real any of these
deaths are in it, well, in terms of
being connected to Hillary, but it does
look like there's a lot of deaths around
Hillary. It does seem like a pretty big
set of
coincidences. All
right, so I wasn't going to talk about
this, but I just have to.
this whole Comey 86 thing. People got
really mad at me and I'm going to help
you out here on how to think about
it. So, number one, if you have complete
certainty that Comey knew exactly what
he was doing and it was a call to have
uh Trump assassinated, I would say
that's the worst to take.
Not that you're
wrong, but that you have a certainty
about what a stranger is
thinking. The certainty is just a
mistake. You've lived in a world where
you've been surprised before about
things you were certain about. And
there's nothing less certain than how
somebody else is thinking.
Now, part of what bothers me about this
story is it's so damn boring because
everybody just says the same five
things, but they say them really angrily
if you don't agree. All right, so I'm
going to sort of say the same five
things and see if you agree with me. Uh,
number one, it comes down to what Comey
was thinking. Would you
agree? Because if you knew magically,
oh, he wasn't thinking about
assassination. He was just thinking
about removing him from
office. And I'm not saying that's what
he was
thinking because how would I know? I
can't read his mind. So, if I told you
I'm certain that he was thinking it was
innocent, well, that would be a
mistake. just as as certain if you said
I'm certain. He was thinking, you know,
maybe I can get people to assassinate
him if I do
this. Hold on, my light went
out. All right.
[Music]
Um, if you were if you want to say that
in his role as head of the FBI, he
should have known that that was a call
to
assassination, I would say, you don't
know that. You don't know that at
all. Because here's what I think.
Even if you had only heard that term in
the restaurant business, which would be
my case, I've only heard it in the
restaurant business. Do you think I
would be confused if I saw a movie where
somebody was a professional
sniper and their partner or their boss
said, you know, once they had lined up
the sights on somebody, the professional
sniper, and the boss said, "All right,
86."
Do you think I would be confused about
what 86 meant in that context? No, not
at all. Suppose it was a professional
hitman for the mafia and I saw the movie
and somebody said, "All right, we're
going to 86 a veto." Even if I had never
heard that word being used in that
context, would I be confused about what
it meant? No. No. That would be
completely true because that's how words
work. You can wax your car and nobody
thinks that's assassinating the car. But
if a mafia hitman said, "I'm going to
wax veto," you would know that wax meant
kill
veto. So the word means a different
thing based on the context. Now, here's
the here's the interesting thing.
We don't think that Comey arranged the
shells himself,
right? Can Can you give me a fact check
on that? I believe he just saw it and
then thought, "Oh, I'm going to take a
picture of this."
Do you think that even if Comey would
have definitely known if he'd heard 86
in the context of a hitman or the mafia,
just like you and me, he would have
definitely known that was a call for
violence in that those contexts. But
when he saw seashells on the
beach, are you still so sure that he
thought that was a clear call to
violence?
Now, we can't believe what he says. You
know, he said, "Oh, I didn't realize
that was interpreted as violence, so I
took it down." But how many of you
believe that Comey, being the
sophisticated, clever guy you think he
is, said to himself, "I think I'll do a
call for
assassination with these seashells, and
then I'll post it on Instagram, and
everything will be fine."
How many of you think that that was his
thought process? That he was going to
call call for
assassination, post it on social media,
and that there wouldn't be any problem
with
that cuz that would be super
stupid. It wouldn't be super clever. It
would be super stupid.
So, is he super
stupid or is he somebody who saw the
context was seashells that somebody else
put there and thought they probably
weren't thinking about murdering him.
They probably just wanted to get rid of
him. And he thought, "Oh, it's clever
that you could put these two numbers
together, 86 and
47."
So, here's what here's my take. We don't
know what he was thinking.
But if you're 100% sure that Comey saw
seashells on the beach and took a
picture of them and thought that he was
going to call for assassination and post
it on Instagram and that would be a good
play. That's not a good
take. Not 100% sure. If you tell me I
think he might have been thinking of
that, I would say he might have been. If
you say he might not have been thinking
that and he was just not really thinking
of anything and he didn't think it
through, I would say
maybe. But if you're positive, you're
100% sure you know what he was thinking
when he did it. That's a terrible
take. It's a terrible take. Could you be
right? Yes. Yes, you could. Am I telling
you that he definitely was not thinking
that it was, you know, his clever way to
kill Trump? I'm not saying that because
I'm not saying I can read his
mind. What I am saying is if it were me,
and I definitely know that if you're
using 86 to talk to a hitman, it would
be about violence. If I saw some
seashells on the beach, I wouldn't
necessarily connect that with any
violent
thought, but it doesn't mean he thought
that way. Now, would you agree that this
topic is really
boring? Because we don't know what he
was thinking. It's not going to go
anywhere. As long as there's a common
usage of the word 86 and he's not even
the one who arranged the shells, he's
not going to get
arrested. It's just something to talk
about where we all just say the same
 things over and over again. Oh,
but don't you know that he's so smart?
He's so smart that he would know that
that means kill him.
Okay, you don't have to say it over and
over again. All right. So, how about we
just never talk about this
again?
Agreed. All
right. Uh Mario was uh calling out
something from Scitec
Daily. Apparently, there's a what could
be a really big discovery.
So they found a way to use something
called tin paravoskite which is a mix of
tin and crystalall-like structures to
split water into clean
hydrogen. And apparently it's stable
which is a big deal and it's efficient
and cost effective and you could
basically just use this to create
unlimited hydrogen.
Now,
[Music]
uh, the next sea shell arrangement will
talk about voting for the budget. Okay?
See how mad you're getting? See the if
you're feeling anger about that Comey
topic, it's because you know you're
wrong. That's what's causing the anger.
You you you know you didn't have a good
take and I called you out on it and
you're like,
Anyway, so apparently this would uh you
can use just sunlight and water and turn
it into hydrogen and it could be this
huge leap toward uh you know green
energy. I wonder if it's real. Seems
almost too good, doesn't it? But maybe
maybe we'll
see. Well, you know how the Democrats
are having trouble finding a leader that
they all seem to be losers. Well, Stacy
Abrams was on
MSNBC and she was asked what the
Democrats need to do to win. And her
take was they need to focus on their
values, not their policies, their
values. And uh she called out DEI as
like one of their top values. So, in
order to win, they need to focus on
DEI. They're not really sending their
best, are
they? I totally want Stacy Abrams to
focus on DEI and run for president. See
how that
goes. Not so well. Well, there's a some
kind of a bomb went off at a Palm
Springs fertility
clinic. Um, and the FBI is calling it an
intentional act of
terrorism.
H I wonder if there are any kind of
suspicious things that are happening at
the same
time. Huh. So, there is an intentional
act of terrorism that would be blamed on
the far right, right? Because it's a
fertility clinic.
So, isn't this uh evidence that the the
far right are the dangerous ones? Is is
that the way it'll be told? Huh. I
wonder if there are any other stories
that are sort of in the same vein at the
same time. Oh, here's one. Uh, it's
about combat sport
clubs. Combat sport clubs. Now, I'm
going to tell you the story, and I want
you to see how many red flags you can
you can pick out. Number one, it's on
CBS. So, it's a CBS news story. Bing.
Okay, that was an easy one cuz you don't
trust them for news. But what they say
is that uh combat sports clubs have been
used to boost recruitment for white
nationalist hate groups. Oh. Uh oh. So,
at the same time that a bomb went off at
a fertility clinic, CBS News was all was
already to drop a story about white
nationalist hate
groups. That's probably just a total
coincidence, right?
Ping. Um, and that's according to a
report released by the Southern Poverty
Law Center.
Ping. Remember I always tell you if you
know what happened, you don't know
anything. But if you know who happened
or who was involved, you might know a
lot. So now we've got
CBS reporting on the Southern Poverty
Law Center. You know anything about that
group?
Well, that group is not exactly
credible, at least with the rightwing
part of the
world. All right. And their the report
uh they've been tracking the efforts of
the Patriot Front.
Ping. So, they they had all lined up a
story about the Patriot Front. Huh.
Well, that's kind of interesting timing.
And apparently the Patriot Front
um they say is a white nationalist
movement that was formed following the
deadly Unite the Right rally in
Charlottesville.
Ping ping ping ping ping
ping. The Unite the Right rally in
Charlottesville.
I don't believe that that was organic. I
think that was somewhat
obviously some kind of an op. I mean
like really
obviously. Uh so they're they're tying
it to that. So so far we've got CBS, the
Southern Poverty Law Center, Patriot
Front, and the Charlottesville event.
It's all in the same
story. Does that activate anything for
you? it gets better. So, Robert Rundo is
the founder of the of the white
supremacist group in Southern
California, and he's the one credited
with introducing this idea of the active
uh
clubs, right? So, what do we know about
Robert Rundo H? Well, according to CBS,
uh he was arrested in Romania in 2023.
Ping. After the US requested his
extradition on federal rioting charges,
he was sentenced to two years and
effectively received a time served ping
sentence being released in December of
2024. Does any of that
story sound organic and real to
you? I'm going to say there's not a
single thing here that looks credible.
Not a single
thing. Now, I don't know what's true and
what isn't, but in terms of credibility,
this has every signal for not being
real. Everyone. And it dropped at the
same time as that bomb went off at the
fertility clinic. Huh. I wonder if we're
on the verge of the fake news talking
about the big problem with these
far-right
extremists, which would be sort of right
on
time. Were you not expecting
that? Didn't we all know that was
coming? Of course we did. Is it this? I
don't know.
Well, in other news according to the
Hill, so uh Trump is uh mad at Walmart
and limb based them over raising their
prices because of
tariffs. And this is what uh Trump said.
He said, quote, "Walmart should stop
trying to blame tariffs as a reason for
raising prices throughout the chain." Um
so Trump said this on True Social.
Walmart made billions of dollars last
year, far more than expected. And then
Trump says, "Between Walmart and China,
they should, as I said, eat the tariffs
and not charge valued customers
anything." He added, "I'll be watching
and so will your
customers."
Well, now if Trump can pull this off,
I'll be very impressed.
But the the normal way these tariffs
would kind of express themselves is if
it were a low margin
item, Walmart's not going to sell low
margin items for a loss because there's
an extra charge that eats up the entire
margin. And I don't know if these are
high margin. So I if they're low margin
things, they pretty much have to pass
along the expense to the customer or
else get out of the business. And but if
it's high margin
stuff, then he's got a bit of an
argument, which is you should maybe
maybe eat
it. But uh I don't think the president
should be telling a private company how
to price things.
It feels like a little bit of a, you
know,
overreach, but it's very key to his
whole strategy because if everybody
starts raising prices,
um, then his tariff idea looks like a
worse idea. And Walmart's sort of the,
you know, the the canary in the coal
mine, you know, if they go first, but
they're also the biggest canary.
So, I imagine if Trump can bully Walmart
into not raising
prices, then other retailers are going
to say, "All right, we don't need this
trouble. You know, we don't need this
kind of trouble aiming at us, so maybe
we should ease some of this
tariff." But in any case, it's
not in any case, it still looks like a
tax on
somebody. All right.
Um, you've you've heard this story
before, but I'm going to add something
to it. So, the Oklahoma State
Superintendent of Schools, Ryan Walters,
um, he was on TV talking about the fact
that Oklahoma is going to be teaching
their students that there were
irregularities in the 2020
election. and uh they're going to let
the students make up their own minds if
those irregularities are coincidence
uh or had some good reason for them or a
sign of some kind of uh rigged
election. Now, I like it if if it's
going to help them do reasoning and, you
know, just figure it out on their own.
But let me say this. If the 2028
election, whoever is running, if the
2028 election ends up with having the
the same amount of outrageous Democrat
votes as Biden did in
2020, then I am willing to say that 2020
was not rigged.
However, if I had to bet, I'd put a
pretty big bet on as long as the uh
Republicans were sending out their
lawyers to watch all the voting places
like they did in 2024.
uh as long as it's being watched
carefully, if they only get the same
amount of votes that you would expect in
a normal trend line like every other
election, because the number of people
who vote Democrat is kind of
consistent. And so if it's
consistent with the past but not 2020,
I'm going to say, "Oh, there it is.
There. There's your I It's not exactly
proof, but it would be good enough for
me. If I saw that they could not
reproduce the number of votes they got
in
2020, even eight years later when there
were more people who could vote, I'm
going to say, okay, 2020 was definitely
rigged. Because if you throw on top of
that that the bell weathers all went
crazy that just that one year and if all
the bell weathers work in 2028 and the
number of votes looks like the trend
line and not like
2020 was
rigged. I'm just going to say that. So I
think you we can find out in
2028. So, as you know, Representative
James Comr is going to bring in people
to testify to Congress about the
autopen. So, you know, Biden used the
auto pen or somebody used the autopen,
we don't know who. And uh it was signing
the things that Biden should have been
signing. And apparently most of the
signatures were autopen, which raises
the question, who was actually in
charge?
But I did a little bit of research, well
actually somebody else grocked it and
posted it um to find
out what is the process for getting
something signed with the auto pen.
Wouldn't you
assume that even if the president were
on vacation or something that the
president would still have to sign
something and and what they'd signed
would be instead of the bill which would
not be physically where the president is
if they're on vacation or something. um
they'd sign a little at least a
memo that would say I authorize you to
use the auto pen for this purpose and
then there would be further
documentation of who got that memo and
when they executed
it. Now did James Comr
already get all that? So, wouldn't he
have by now requested the trail, the
paper trail? Cuz there would be a paper
trail. It's not just that suddenly
there's an auto pen
signature. That's not a
thing. the the the only way the autopen
is going to be used is if there's a
chain of orders that you can see from
the top top guy to the
autopen operator. You know, it's going
to be locked up and there's probably
only one person who has access to it.
So, how do we not already
know that
chain? Or it could be that we don't
trust that even if Biden signed a memo
saying use the auto pen that he knew
what he was
signing. So maybe maybe this exercise is
more about embarrassing the Democrats
and keeping this in the news. I I don't
think this is going to turn into
anything. It it doesn't seem to me that
at the end of this we're going to find
out that there was somebody else running
the country. probably
not, but it certainly keeps the uh
Democrats on their back
feet.
Um there's a study, the source is CBS on
this, well CBS is writing about it, but
they're they didn't do the study that
uh 3 days of silence makes your brain
grow new memory cells. So researchers
found that when your brain gets quiet
um it it gets smarter basically. So that
you should do uh two hours of real quiet
a day where you turn off your devices
and you're not talking to anybody and
you're just sitting there quietly.
Now, how many of you have two hours
extra per day that you weren't doing
something important and you could just
sit there
quietly? Do any of you have two hours a
day that you could do that? You know, I
uh I I've had recommended to me by very
smart people that I should get up and
meditate for an hour before I get busy.
And I thought to myself, who has an hour
when they wake
up? I'd love to have an hour to just sit
there, but who has an hour to do
that? I don't know. I'm sure there's
something to it,
but Well, Trump
said that he's going to talk to Putin on
Monday and uh try to sort out this whole
Ukraine Russia war thing.
Um, and then he's going to talk to
Zilinski afterwards and then after him
the NATO members and Trump says
hopefully it will be a productive day. A
ceasefire will take
place. I don't think any of that's going
to
happen. Do you think there's any chance
of getting peace in
Ukraine? All the indications are that
Putin is not interested.
So unless he's got some way to put
extreme pressure on Putin, and he might
make some threats about further
sanctions and stuff like that, but he
better have a hell of a threat to change
Putin's mind because I'm pretty sure
that Putin doesn't want peace at this
point. I think he's just waiting
everybody out. He just probably figures,
okay, they're going to give up
eventually. You know, it doesn't it
might take me five more years, but
they'll give up. They'll just get tired
of funding this losing
Ukraine. Maybe. Well, in other news,
Iran Supreme Leader Kam, am I saying
that right,
Kam? They all have names that sound like
that. Um, you posted on X, the
dangerous, deadly, cancerous tumor in
West Asia must and will be eliminated,
uh, would that be Israel?
And uh if if we think we're doing a
peace
deal with
Iran and and as of today, the Supreme
Leader is saying the deadly cancerous
tumor in West Asia must be eliminated
and will be
eliminated. That doesn't sound like he
wants a lot of peace. That sounds like
he's developing a nuke.
Um but then the president of Iran who
doesn't have much power compared to the
supreme leader but the president says uh
that the messaging coming from the US is
all basically
ambiguous. Um I think Trump said that
that we have given Iran a
proposal and Iran says we don't have any
proposal. What are you talking about?
And we don't even know what you
want. So the tough part, as I understand
it, is that Iran wants the ability to
enrich uranium to any level. But if you
ask them, will you agree to not make
nukes? They would say, yeah, we totally
agree. We won't make nuclear weapons,
but you can't take from us our ability
to enrich our own
uranium. to which I say that this is a
tough one because Iran is
a you know it's a
sovereign situation and they should be
able to enrich uranium as much as they
want anytime they want. Now, I can see
why we would say you can't make a
weapon, but if they can enrich a
uranium, and they're really, really good
at it, and they can enrich it up to
weapons grade, they had the right
equipment and the right time and
everything, it's as good as saying
they're going to have a nuclear
weapon. So, on one hand, you can see why
a country would say, why do you get to
decide how much uranium we we
enrich? that's nobody's business but our
own and we're enriching it for I don't
know medical uses and all that domestic
nuclear whatever. Um, so you can see why
they would they would kind of hold tight
on that. Like you can't tell us how much
uranium we can
enrich. And at the same time, we can see
why the United States would be tough on
you can't you can't even
enrich because it would be the same as
saying you can have a bomb. You know, I
if you get to the point where it only
takes a few weeks for you to enrich it
enough that it's a bomb, at the same
time you you're getting better and
better at producing missiles, you know,
non-nuclear missiles. Well, that's
really just giving you permission to
make a
bomb. Um EJ says, "Scott, does Israel
have nuclear weapons?" What kind of what
kind of question is that?
Literally everybody knows
that. So is that a serious question?
You're just
trolling. So yes, everybody knows that
we're not looking at a fair situation
where both of them have nukes. But
nobody expects Israel to use a nuclear
weapon in an offensive way, do they?
But we do
think then why can't Iran? That's just a
stupid
question. Really? Do I have to explain
it? Do I have to explain why we don't we
don't mind that our friends
uh and allies have nukes, but we don't
want our we don't want the guy who just
said he wants to wipe out the cancer of
of a certain country. Do do you think
those are the
same? If Iran struck first, they would
be completely
obliterated.
Yes. But we still don't want them to
have a nuke because they could threaten
that they're going to use it and it
would change the whole balance of power.
So if you're saying, you know, what
would be fair
from, you know, some completely
hypothetical
stand, what would be fair is that
everybody could have a
nuke. If you're saying what will
work, you don't want the crazy ones to
have a
nuke. So I guess the real question
is why would Iran even want to get so
close to a nuclear weapon? it's to use
it or to use it as a threat and that
would be almost as
good. So, stop asking stupid questions.
That's just
stupid. All
right.
Um, so it looks to me like there's no
way to make a deal with a ram. So, I
would expect no beast
deal. All right. That's all I got for
today. And I'll remind you that Owen
Gregorian's going to have a spaces right
after this. Um, so I'm going to say hi
to the uh locals people privately, but
that'll just give Owen enough time to
set up his spaces and then we can meet
over there. Okay, I'll probably drop
into that uh as well. All right,
everybody. Happy Sunday. Thanks for
joining.
[Music]
Uh, is Comey claiming he found them
arranged that way? Nobody's claiming
that he arranged them. So, yes, I
believe the story is that he found it,
not that he did
it. That's my
understanding. All right, EJ drop
dead. All right, everybody else. Uh,
we'll see you at Owens. And let me use
it
on locals.
