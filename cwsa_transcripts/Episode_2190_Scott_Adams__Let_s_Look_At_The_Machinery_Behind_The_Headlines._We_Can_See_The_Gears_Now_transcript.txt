foreign
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
today we're also streaming just to test
things out on Twitter live
uh I might not be looking at the Twitter
comments
because when I tested this before I went
live earlier today
many of you wanted to talk about my
vaccination status
that's one year ago
we're not talking about that again
so so just try to come forward to the
future which I call the present and if
you'd like to increase the enjoyment
that you're having now wow and by the
way you can watch this show every day on
YouTube and also on the locals platform
if you're a subscriber I'm not sure if
I'll keep doing it on the on this
platform or not so we'll just test it
today if we like it maybe we'll do more
of it
it's good to see that little Periscope
look isn't it
but how about the simultaneous sip
now this could be quite the Delight for
those of you who have never experienced
a simultaneous sip because all you need
is a copper mug or a glass a tanker
jealous of Steiner can teen Jugger
flaska vessel levitic eye fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
things makes everything better it's
called simultaneous sip go
oh that was pretty good it was pretty
good
three times the platform
twice the coffee
uh well
I have a suggestion for all of you
for whenever you are Tweeting or
referring to January 6.
because we've been calling it j6 right
j6 January 6 you know the use the
insurrection
but I would rather uh I want to reframe
that
from now on January 6 will be called
wait for it
hold on I want to make sure you're all
ready
from now on January 6 will be called
Trump's raging insurrection
Trump's raging insurrection
is funnier
yeah so he's going to be impeached over
his raging insurrection
which I think impressed the entire world
yeah because I want I want every time
this comes up I want to laugh at it
because I can't take the real news
seriously anymore I mean can you because
the news is just ridiculous it's just
absurd
so we might as well have fun with it
because
there's not much else there's not much
else they can do for you except
entertain you you know I think I said
this years ago that the reason that
comedy doesn't work anymore is that
reality and comedy merged
comedy only works when it looks
different than reality and it really
doesn't know like legitimately
hyperbole aside it actually doesn't look
different the comedy and the reality the
absurdity levels throw the roof
well anyway
um there's a controversy there's a an AI
uh influencer now
who's on I don't know where she has on
Instagram I think but it's a AI creation
that has photographs and video of a
creature which is not a real creature
it's an AI creature that is it's branded
as artificial but people are not
convinced she's artificial because she
looks well I called her she
see how easy this is
I I'm literally telling you a story
about an artificial entity
that is pretending to be a female and I
I reflexively referred to
that AI as she
because it looks and acts like a human
if you don't think I think Mike cervich
said this if you don't think that
regular ordinary human males
if you don't think they're going to have
actual deep relationships with these AI
creatures you're wrong
the people are going to have lifelong
relationships with AI you can see it
it's obvious now I don't know if women
will
I I have less less insight into what a
female brain is like but I can tell you
that men are going to find the AI
versions better than the alternatives
and they're they're right on the cusp of
that so that should change reproduction
in the world pretty pretty much the
virtual influencer is called Mila Sophia
so if you've been sending money to your
girlfriend girlfriend named Mella Sophia
just know that you're one of many people
who have done that apparently a number
of people have offered to send this
girlfriend some money
so don't do that don't send
don't send money to anything that looks
good on the screen
I mean that's a good general rule
all right yes the question Kevin's
asking is is Andrew Tate going to pimp
out virtual women well he's he's out on
house arrest apparently the house arrest
is over and Andrew take and walk around
now
now do you remember my how many remember
my prediction about the Tate brothers
that where this would end up does
anybody remember my prediction
I'm not sure if I said it specifically
that's why I'm asking I may have hinted
at it but not said it but
when I hinted at
was that his level of persuasion skill
is not normal
it's just just way above average and I
didn't think any jail could hold him
isn't that funny I I don't think any
jail can hold them I I think you have
seriously a Silence of the Lamb
situation
where the prisoner is just more powerful
than than the present and I don't like
Andrew Tate
in case anybody's new new to my live
stream we're not friends yeah but for me
it's personal I just have a personal
beef with them so you know
uh irrespective of his message you can
make your own decision on that I don't
like him personally
uh but it is also true
that his level of persuasion skill some
of it came from me
unfortunately I'm at least partially
responsible because I know he was he was
following me before he became famous
uh or or this famous anyway so I know he
was picking up persuasion tricks and you
can see him Implement his perseveration
skills and he's really good at it and my
my take was that I don't see how a
prison I don't see how he could be
convicted unless the system is broken
I think he'll just talk his way out of
jail
and so far he's talked his way you know
out of jail and into home custody and
now he's talked his way out of house
arrest
so I don't know what's next but I'm
going to make a prediction
he's not going to go back to jail
does anybody want to take the other side
of that
and I'm saying this with no regard to
the evidence and no regard to what he
may or may not have done
so has nothing to do with what he's done
has only to do with his abilities right
now I honestly don't think a jail could
hold him
isn't that weird
is weird but true I don't think any jail
can hold him I think he could talk his
way out of any jail
so
um and of course to put anybody in jail
you're going to need something like
Witnesses
do you think do you think they're having
any trouble finding people to testify
against them
they might be
they might be having a lot of trouble
finding somebody to testify against him
because he's persuasive but also maybe
he has too many friends on the outside
so I don't know I feel like it would be
dangerous to testify against them even
if he didn't do anything about it
he has a lot of people who might
take things into their own hands which
would be super bad
but it's a real thing I mean it's a real
risk so I don't know I just don't think
he can be jail
um
superconductivity that I keep talking
about
that others are trying to reproduce give
me a fact check on this but they have
reproduced it now right
are we yet confident that this is a real
room temperature
superconductivity situation now I would
say there's still what do we call a
lk-99 is the the cool nerdish turn for
it
now the question I've got
is whether or not this really can be
scaled up you know the early reporting
was these are common materials we we
have lots of it we can scale this up and
it will be changing everything because
once you have superconductivity you've
got Quantum Computing and lossless you
know transportation of electricity and a
whole bunch of things become possible uh
in the real world if you can do
superconductivity
um and it looks like we're there
I mean if you just take one thing
just take one thing Quantum computing
suppose that's the only thing that
changed
and then suddenly your computer's a
quantum computer that's a little bit
better than the one you have now let me
tell you a little bit better like way
way way better
now you combine your AI
with a quantum computer
I don't know what we end up with who
knows I mean who knows where that goes
but all bets are off
there's a
there's literally nothing
that you can predict
I would say that predicting the work the
the world in
five to ten years is now an exercise in
absurdity
that wasn't really always the case I
mean nobody's great at predicting five
to ten years out but you know we were
taking seriously things like climate
change risk in 50 years
we're acting like
50 years is like a perfectly good
a matter of time that you can predict
things but that's clearly nonsense at
this point
can quantum computers do general purpose
Computing I believe they can
can somebody confirm that the the
quantum computer can be your general
computer right
I mean if they got it efficient enough
there's no reason it wouldn't no oh
somebody's saying no
oh I'm getting no I'm getting fact
jacked on this that it it wouldn't be
not yet well no I understand that at the
moment there's special purpose but
that's only because that's all we can
make
it isn't the whole point if you could
make soup if you can make a quantum
computer in an easy way
then it could be your general computer
am I wrong about that
I think I'm right about that but I'll
take a fact check on that if I'm wrong
all right let's move on
Roseanne Barr who uh you may know she
transitioned she used to be Bill Barr
she used to be Bill Barr attorney
general but now she's Roseanne Barr
she's identifying as a woman Roseanne
Barr
no I made that up that's not true
they're different people no no different
people I made that up
um
but Roseanne is getting her own show and
uh on on the X on the rebranded Twitter
goldex and it looks like it's going to
be part of a larger platform that's part
of public SQ or Public Square
which I think is Don Jr's Don Jr is a at
least a prominent part of that
so it looks like there's some kind of a
probably a conservative I assume
conservative leaning platform
actually it's an anti-woke platform is
the way to say it it's an anti-walk
platform and Roseanne's the first one
she's got a six six figure deal
and I guess we'll see more about that
now I did tell you that
Roseanne asked me to be on her podcast
and I said yes
I think that would be a week or two
um but I don't know if that's part of
this
because I don't know if the timing is
the same so maybe I'm on the old version
not the new version but we'll find out
all right so here's my theme of the day
I call it seeing the machinery
would you agree that in the past year
especially although it's been brewing
for a while that you can now see all the
moving parts
of the let's say the effre that's
happening to the public I'll give you
some examples
we can see now uh that but here's one
thing that Joe Biden proved to us and
give me give me your opinion as I go I'm
going to list a few things number one
the existence of Joe Biden as a
president
proves to us that the president isn't
always the one in control would you say
that's true
can can we see that the Machinery says
that they can put a figurehead in and
still have some kind of functional
control now that wasn't a hundred
percent obvious to me before
and it might be a special case because
of Biden but we can say with some
certainty now that you actually don't
need a president with a functioning
brain
because the people around him will just
you know fill in for that and maybe they
were always in control so that's
something that's new
if you told me you could have a
president it was just not even
functional at all and yet things would
just sort of you know move along I don't
know if I would have believed it and I'm
not sure I would believe it about other
presidents
yeah I'm not sure I would say that about
Obama but maybe maybe
I know I wouldn't say it about Trump
so maybe it's a more of a Democrat thing
I don't know maybe
so that's one thing we see now more
clearly we saw that with the 50 Intel
professionals who said the laptop was
Russian disinformation
now you can see that whole mechanism
that part of the machine is transparent
now so now you can see the members of
the intelligence community in various
groups you can see that they're willing
to coordinate for the benefit of
democrat
political purposes
now we know that for sure
and we know it's not onesies and
Tuesdays we can see that they could
fairly easily give 50 people with high
ranking intelligence jobs across various
you know intelligence entities 50 of
them
would all all be willing to sign up for
a lie that shows you the machine doesn't
it it shows you that our intelligence
group is not doing what
you think they're supposed to do they're
also
deeply involved in domestic politics and
this is deeply involved as you could get
so deeply involved it may have
determined who the president was
so we see that Machinery now and you
can't unsee it
right it was so clear so well documented
so obvious that now you can say oh I get
it now the intelligence apparatus and
the Democrats are just part of the same
machine you see those gears work
together
that wasn't as obvious as it was until
the laptop situation that that made it
just super clear to everybody
here's another part of the machine
learning about how Hunter Biden and the
Biden family made their money with this
influence or the illusion of influence
selling
um are we not fully informed now how
that works we all Now understand that
the phone calls don't have to be
anything but proving you have access
right we know that there doesn't have to
be a piece of paper necessarily saying
this is our contract this is our deal we
all just understand how this works
so so we saw in detail exactly how
somebody connected to the current
government you know when Biden was vice
president
we saw how they make money
by providing either access or the
illusion of access that they charge huge
amounts of money for
because they're big entities with a lot
of money and they want a little bit of
Edge and they think they can get it this
way
now
we also saw
that the Democrat press was willing to
cover up all of this
so now we can see that the the Press is
a player not a reporter we can see that
clearly that the press the Democrats and
the intelligence agencies were at least
at least 50 of people from them are all
on a team and they're not on the team
that is trying to uh sell the truth
they're selling a version of the truth
which is just anti-republican and pro
them staying in power and making money
and you see it all now
you know before every everybody knew
that people sold access right we all
knew that everybody knew that
you know lobbying was kind of dirty
everybody knew that the people were
doing this you know foreign agent stuff
without registering you know sort of a
manafort kind of stuff everybody knew
this was going on but when you see it so
clearly and specifically where you've
got an Archer Daniel I'm sorry Archer
Devin Archer Archer Daniel Devin Archer
uh when you have him explaining every
gear in the machine
then you can see it
right
now
what and how about the media narrative
that turned January 6 into an
insurrection
we all got to watch how something that
clearly was not an Insurrection in any
way because nobody really believes you
can overcome a country
you know nobody thinks you can take over
a superpower by trespassing
nobody
but there were but half of the country
was willing to pretend that was real
because the media told to pretend that
way I guess
and we yeah so we know that the media
will change the narrative
and they'll actually make something that
was
unfortunately somewhat normal in
American politics which is a bunch of
people protest and then some of those
people get out of control the most
normal thing in American politics
but the media narrative could turn that
into an actual Insurrection whereas I
like to say Trump's raging insurrection
that's right yeah the law enforcement at
the Capitol they tried to beat off
Trump's raging insurrection
but they had some trouble
yeah Trump's raging Insurrection was too
much
for law enforcement
um
then let's see you also see uh what else
we see we see that the impeachment
process was always fraudulent
you you could smell it and you knew it
when it was happening but now you can
see it really clearly
and you can see that they do in fact
use political processes to cover crimes
we know for example that the impeach the
first impeachment I think Joe Pollock
was saying this and Breitbart the first
impeachment the rules of the impeachment
were that Republicans couldn't call
witnesses
were you aware of that did you know
about that when it happened I feel like
I maybe heard it but I forgot it
there so one side in a essentially
something that's like a fake trial this
impeachment process one side couldn't
call witnesses
do you know what witness the Republicans
would have called
a fellow named Devin Archer
so the entire impeachment process would
have been completely different if the
Republicans could have called you know
Devon Archer because suddenly suddenly
Trump's phone call to Ukraine makes a
lot of sense doesn't it once you know
the whole you know Biden crime family
Devon Archer's situation and you say
wait a minute Trump got in trouble for
wanting to look into that
that's exactly what you want to look
into
he got in trouble for asking a question
could somebody help him look into
something that was clearly
if it wasn't illegal it was very
inappropriate and certainly not in the
best interest of the United States
and he got impeached to that
now do you think his impeachment could
be reversed
because of things like that you know
things we found out after the
impeachment
I think you should be
I think it should be expunged
the I think the Devon Archer
testimony and the fact that the
Republicans couldn't even ask him to
talk which would have completely changed
the context of the entire impeachment
that's good enough to expunge it all you
need is control of the you know the
bodies and you can do it
so maybe that'll happen but would you
agree
that we can now see the entire machine
you can see it from uh the the gaming
that was done during the elections Etc
now there's one part of the machine
that's left
do you know all the conspiracy theories
that turned out to be true
remember all those there was stuff about
vaccinations well it turned out to be
mostly true
there was stuff about the pandemic well
mostly true
stuff about the hunter Biden well mostly
true stuff about the impeachment being
purely political well we knew that and
it's mostly true stuff about the laptop
it turns out it's mostly true
Russia collusion it was the whole she
thought it was
so one by one all of these things that
were at one point
seemed seemed like hoaxes they all seem
true but there's one left
there's one big one left what is it
one big one left
the election
the election itself
what are the odds that everything you
thought was
um may be true turned out to be true
pretty much all of it
but that the election would be the one
thing that was at like that shining
exception
everything you thought about the
Machinery of government was true of all
the bad stuff
but not that one
not that one
and why why do you think uh
why do you think you don't know
more about that could it be that if you
were a news entity and you questioned
the election you would be sued out of
business like Fox News and by the way
I'm not defending anything Fox News said
probably got some things wrong but
everybody does right getting some things
wrong is not exactly
something you would expect the news
business not to do of course they do
it's a human business they get stuff
wrong especially opinion
it's becoming impossible to imagine that
the election was fair
honestly and it's not because I have any
information about the election I don't I
have no information that would say it's
unfair at all all I have is a context
and the context is that every time there
was something that could be rigged it
was
every time
every part of the government that could
be gamed was gamed
everything that could be hidden was
hidden
everything that could be turned into a
narrative to fool you was
every single thing that could be
corrupted
perverted
or made worthless was
all of it every time there was an
opening it happened
but not with the election right
that's the only thing so the most
important thing
the most important thing that we imagine
might have had some vulnerabilities
don't know what they were but it might
have had some
the most important thing is the only
thing they didn't try to gain
I mean gave me it too far we know they
gained it but within within legal bounds
they came to
um
you know yes if this is a movie
we're watching what could be the
greatest third Act of all time and if
it's a movie there's something that has
to happen
which is Trump has to go to court
and in court proves that the elections
were fraudulent or that at least they
they can't be audited or at least that
we can't know if it was real
that that might be good enough to just
prove that it's not fully auditable if
you prove it's not fully auditable then
you can also prove that you don't know
what the result was
it can still be certified and we can
still accept it as true
but you won't know
you wouldn't have any mechanism to know
have you seen the computer code that
runs the machines I haven't
do I have any reason to think there's
anything wrong with that computer code
nope nope I have I have no claims of
fact to add I'm just saying we live in a
world in which any place there could
have been some bad behavior we found it
every Rock we turned over
had something under it
when was the last time we turned over
Iraq when you know we thought there was
something dirty there and we looked and
looked and there was nothing there
well I guess only when you're
investigating some Trump stuff like
Russia collusion in that case it was
nothing there but those are those are
legitimately hoaxes there's a difference
between a hoax
and maybe just be wrong about something
all right so now that we can see the
machine it won't make any difference
well I don't know here's some more of
the machine
um I'm not sure how much credibility I'd
put on this thing
which is uh Tucker Carlson had an
interview with I guess the uh uh former
capital police chief Steven Sund and he
told Tucker that he thinks January 6 was
some kind of a cover-up
and he said quote everything appears to
be a cover-up quote I'm not a conspiracy
theorist but when you look at the
information the intelligence they had
the military had it's all watered down
I'm not getting intelligence I'm denied
any support from National Guard meaning
when he was in a shot in advance
undeniable National Guard while we're
under attack for 71 minutes
and the question of the leadership of
Millie and Pelosi
now this is one person's opinion based
on you know the atmospherics of the time
so I don't think you should conclude
from that one testimony that that there
was something sketchy going on
but you could conclude by the fact that
wherever it was possible for something
sketchy to go on it did every time
so was it possible at all for any of the
characters in January 6 to have
intentionally withheld intelligence
or could they have intentionally
withheld let's say National Guard or
other help
yes that would be easy to do
it would be easy to do
and every time there was something that
was easy to do it would be good for
Democrats they did it
no matter how Weasley and illegal and
lying it was they did it every time
so is this the exception
do you think this is the one time that
there was like a big opening to do
something Weasley that would have been
bad for Trump and they didn't do it
that they had an easy opening to make it
look worse than they couldn't work
looked
and you think that they didn't do it
you think that they wanted to
immediately stop the protest so that
Donald Trump would have nothing working
against them because they immediately
shut down the protest was that what they
wanted to do do you think Democrats were
like oh let's stop this before there's
any violence
well they live in the real world and
they know that if a bunch of trump
supporters wearing Maga hats attack the
capital their best play is to let them
destroy it
that's their best play
do you think they didn't know that do
you think that Nancy Pelosi didn't know
that their best play was to make it look
dangerous
of course it was and of course they do
is this the only time in all of these
observed behavior is this the first time
that they were really operating
legitimately and for the best interest
of all the people
no that's not even a thing I don't know
I think at that level they don't even
think about the public I honestly think
I mean I'm reading minds of course but
they act as though I'll just say they
act as though so I'm not mind reading
they act as though the public isn't even
part of the consideration
it's just whatever works
oh there's plenty to help for
yeah I hope I'm not I hope I'm not
painting a picture of you know all
things are lost to me the ability to see
the machine
is the essential step towards age if we
can't agree what's happening then you
can't change things easily but once you
can see it it's all laid out for you
really clearly well then maybe maybe you
get yourself a new president and maybe
something changes
all right so the big question that we're
talking about with uh
the new Trump indictments is of course
everybody's going to frame it in their
in their own way so one of the frames is
that this would criminalize lying under
the narrow situation that a politician
lies but you can show that they knew
they were lying they knew it wasn't true
and therefore some action happened in
this case the conspiracy some would say
and that the action is really the
problem but the the lying was
contributing to the action so it's the
action this problem not the LIE
but
in politics there's always action
somebody's always acting they're either
voting differently or they're
complaining or threatening or doing
something
so if you criminalize lying
that somebody else says you knew because
that's the important part somebody else
gets to decide what was in your head
that's never good
somebody else gets to decide what you're
thinking when you lied were you thinking
it was true or were you thinking it
wasn't
you know
so I'm not sure I guess uh Bill Barr
said you know it's not so much about
that
the lying is not the problem I think
Bill Barr would say is that it was part
of a conspiracy so it was just you know
one element of the conspiracy so if they
prove the conspiracy
it's not about the lying
I'll buy that
I think there are two narratives that
are neither of them are quite accurate
I think the truth is somewhere in
between that it's not about it's not
about his Free Speech it's about
allegedly some conspiracy things to over
or to delay or overturn the election
but it's also true that if you create a
precedent
that the things he said he according to
other people he knew it was a lie
and therefore bad things happen because
of it if that if you let that standard
to become a precedent
I guess all politicians go to jail
pretty pretty quickly
so
I think both sides are right
that it is not about Free Speech but the
president it could set would be about
free speech does that make sense the
case is not available free speech per se
it's just that it would accidentally
have this
side effect
I'm seeing those
no
yeah with the legal stuff here let me
give you a better this is the most
useful thing I could do have you noticed
that as soon as there's legal stuff
mixed with politics that there are only
some people who are qualified to talk
about it
right so when Jonathan Turley talks
about it he knows politics and he knows
the law because that's his job and he's
a great writer
so what he says is way more useful than
what other people are saying same with I
keep mentioning Joel Pollock when we're
talking about these topics because he
has you know legal background
who follows the news is a great writer
that's a perfect combination Ben Shapiro
yeah he has he's legal right he's got a
law degree Ben Shapiro
uh dershowitz again right dershowitz is
good Mike cernovich
legal background
knows politics knows how to tweet better
than anybody
yeah so there's some people you should
follow and I'm not sure I'm one of them
uh I would really really favor your uh
your information toward the ones who
have some at least a little bit of a law
degree background
you're going to get you're going to get
much better
all right
wow
um
I just saw a meme there all right
um
Kimberly stressel and Wall Street
Journal was talking about this about the
the lying
all right
um
to me it seems like the precedent would
be way way way too dangerous I can't
imagine that the Supreme Court
would ever get behind this
do we all assume that it ends up in the
Supreme Court and gets thrown out and
the only the only issue is whether
there's a timing thing you know whether
it's before or after an election or
something
I don't think anybody thinks he's going
to jail
do you
how many think he's going to go to jail
uh here's why I think you won't
go if you put him in jail he you're
there's going to be physical violence
would you agree
I don't think you can avoid physical
violence if he goes to jail
yeah now I'm not recommending it I want
to say as clearly as possible I do not
recommend any physical violence for
anything
except self-defense
um but it would be unavoidable at that
point because at that point the country
would be lost and you actually would be
Boston Tea Party Time that would
actually be an actual Revolution
I would consider that
um
I wouldn't be violent myself and I
wouldn't recommend it but I would
understand it
we certainly understand it
all right
um
there just to change the topic a little
bit because we're getting tired of all
this legal stuff
um over in Germany they've built some
houses this passive house thing by Road
architects
and they figured out how to basically
seal a home really tight insulate it
really well and use almost no um
no AC or warming
and it's passive so they're just uh
they're piping heat in they make sure
the sun is the right orientation the
windows are super sealed and they've got
I don't know the technology but they've
got some kind of a uh what they call it
a energy recovery ventilation Erv and
then there's something that cleans the
air because it's so sealed and blah blah
but here's the point
it's a 2500 square foot house
that cost maybe 15 percent more than a
normal house but of course that would
probably go down if they make a lot of
them and it doesn't it doesn't require
Heating and Cooling
let me just imagine it
so we were worried about
um you know the future of homes and the
future of climate change but if you can
get a really and they look really good
they look great uh they're well designed
and everything if you could get a 2500
square foot home that you walk in it
just looks amazing I mean it's better
than a normal home it's just High design
and and you didn't have to pay for
energy
it's going to be really tempting for
people to
you know want to want those homes I've
been saying for a long time that the big
economy of the future for America is
going to be rebuilding our homes because
all of our existing homes are built
wrong
the existing homes are not built for our
lifestyle or our energy
profile
they were built when energy was cheap
and we didn't know how to build homes as
well and our lifestyles were different
imagine building a home today without a
home office
if you build a home today two home
offices is the right number right
two adults the the odds that you need
two home offices is pretty high
so everything that we do about building
today let's take take it easy like an
easy one
it's hard to get your Wi-Fi to work
throughout your home but if you build it
in the first place with the
understanding that it needed some you
know wi-fi boosters or whatever you're
good
so there's almost nothing about the way
a home is built today
that is optimized
even compared to what we know how to do
today
so I think it's going to be gigantic
rebuilding from old you know tearing
down the old ones and building the new
better ones
um
so I saw a tweet by uh John Byrne
Murdock he showed two charts and it
shows uh this huge trend line change
where sometime around the pandemic of
course the the trust in science by
Republicans you know dive toward the
ground and the trust in science by
democrats zoomed toward the sky I mean
just really were
and
John Byrne Murdoch says it's a tragic
story in two charts he says
now there's a big partisan gap for a
trusted science and he says the
Republicans are now essentially the
anti-science party while Dems are
stridently pro
is that what's happening
is it pro science versus anti-science
that's what's happening
let me uh let me put a different
interpretation on the same data same
data I accept the data how about this
interpretation or are Republicans the
anti-bull party and Democrats are
brainwashed sheep
yeah maybe one doesn't believe
and the other are brainwashed sheep and
what do you call brainwashed sheep
Pro science apparently apparently Pro
science is what you call brainwashed
sheep
now
I like to say I'm Pro science so I'm
probably a brainwashed sheep but if you
trust anything from science after the
pandemic
how do you explain to yourself
how do you explain trusting science in
2023
now
there's no conflict between these
following statements all right if you
don't understand this you miss the whole
pandemic
two statements there's no conflict
number one the scientific process is the
number one best way to figure out what's
true and what isn't
everybody with me the scientific process
the process
not the people the process is the best
way to find out what's true
okay
now we can say that that's true can we
all say can we also say that most most
the majority of the science that's
presented to us by people
is
most yeah that's actually proven do you
know what proved that most of it's
 the scientific process because
they looked into it and they saw they
counted how many how many papers are
reproducible
turns out not most
it's mostly
the thing that we're presented as
science by scientists and by the media
is mostly if you're a Democrat
and you still think that the the things
scientists are telling you are probably
true
I feel really sorry for you
I mean actually like I have empathy for
that imagine going through life thinking
that the things that they're telling you
are true
sometimes that might be true but it's
it's going to be totally unknown when
they tell you
so it can be true the science is your
best way to know what's true while at
the same time
you can you can observe clearly the
machine and the Machine uses science
selectively
to brainwash you
so if you tell me does science tell you
what's true if you do it right the
answer is yes
but then you have to get a little bit
real world about it and then you say but
are bad people using science to launder
 under the the cover of science
yes they're called science they're
called politicians for the most part yes
right so to imagine that those two views
are not consistent is something I guess
you'd have to be a Democrat to
understand
all right
uh and then large the larger point the
data is largely useless in 2023 but
Democrats have don't know yet
so science would be a lot better if the
data that they used was all accurate but
the one thing we know for sure is that
the data is
we know that right just in general all
of our data pretty much all of our data
is suspect
some of it might be right
but how would you know
there's so much that's wrong that we
don't have a way to pick out the ones
that are right not the public right if
you're a scientist reproducing a study
maybe yes and then even then even if
you're a scientist and you reproduce a
study
you still don't know if it's correlation
or causation
there's still some interpretation that
you end up putting on top of it
all right here's a good example of why I
always say analogies don't work have you
ever heard me say that if you're making
an argument and your argument depends on
an analogy you don't have an argument
right
and let me say this as clearly as
possible if you have an argument that
depends on logic and facts and the facts
and the logic are good that's pretty
solid
you might want to put an analogy on top
of your logic and facts to make it
easier to package and describe the story
but the analogy is not the argument the
argument still has to be the logic and
the facts
the analogy is just to storytize it you
know make it easier to convey right
so don't confuse the analogy with the
data and the logic one one is just for
sales just for selling something and the
other is for understanding something
so Al Sharpton ran into that problem
when he said can you imagine he was
talking about January 6 and Trump and
trying to quote overthrow the election
and he said can you imagine Jefferson
and Madison trying to overthrow the
government
yeah yeah he actually said can you
imagine
the American revolutionaries
having a revolution against the
government
and that somebody tried to save him on
Twitter
you say Scott though you realize that
that was a dictatorship he's not they
weren't overthrowing a democratically
elected government
to which I say
what's that got to do with anything
if you don't like your government you
don't like your government
it doesn't matter how it got there right
if you're a revolutionary you're a
revolutionary but it's the dumbest thing
a public
person has had in a long time and that's
including everything that uh
everything that Kamala Harris has said
can you imagine Jefferson and Madison
and I guess my comment about this
yeah I made a snarky comment and it got
picked up by a bunch of Publications so
if you tweet well
you get quoted all right CNN is creating
the narrative that Putin is waiting for
Trump to get reelected
because Trump will be friendly to Putin
were you expecting were you expecting
that of course of course
remember the machinery
CNN is just part of the machine
so this part of the machine has to turn
because Trump is getting closer and
closer to reelection so they got to turn
up the part that says that uh he's he's
blowing Putin oh no he's he's his lover
of Putin I I think they're BFFs they're
they're pen pals I think they have a
sexual relationship or something right
so you got to turn that up so they
started today
let's start today now here's my take
if if Putin is in fact waiting for Trump
why is that a problem
other than it'd be good if things
wrapped up sooner but
why is that a problem
why are we complaining about it
doesn't that tell you that he thinks
that Trump can end the end of War
here's what I say
I see two entities that because of
whatever their domestic situation is
they can't make peace they can't
you need you need a large outside force
to make them do it so they can say well
we didn't want to but those Americans
and NATO they just forced our hand what
could we do we have to make it make a
deal so of course he's waiting what what
do you think Putin wants to do do you
think Putin wants to uh Just Surrender
so he can't win and he can't just give
up because I would look weak and
terrible of course he's waiting because
Trump's the only one who says he's going
to negotiate it into the war you don't
think that Putin wants an end to the war
of course he does
so the fact that Putin thinks that Trump
would be a better leader in this
situation and the fact that he agrees
with
you know maybe a third of the public or
so now
that's not necessarily A Bad Thing
right let Putin let Putin say he'd
prefer a president that will make a deal
and let him get the deal
so
Chris Christie's at the Ukraine now oh
my God
do you know what you're not going to see
Trump go to Ukraine do you want to take
any bets on that there's anything
anybody think that Trump's going to
visit Ukraine not a chance
not a chance
it will be stupid
I mean I hope so I mean I hope he
doesn't it would be ridiculous
if he did
but I guess Chris Christie's got a
I don't know I I don't know what game
he's playing he's obviously not going to
be president or vice president
um
Senator Feinstein who's uh I believe her
age is uh 300 she's she's over 300 years
old and she's given power of attorney to
her daughter
for her personal affairs
so she's so incompetent
that her daughter has power of attorney
to make all of her you know legal
decisions and stuff but she's still a
sitting Senator and has not resigned
so she's one of the people running your
country
after having admitted she can't run her
own life
because she has somebody else in charge
of it
and we're okay with that
why because we can see the machine we're
not really okay you can see the machine
the machine is just not making it a
story
so unless Fox News mentions it it
doesn't come up
so they just sort of live with it like
that's okay
you see the machine all they care about
is the vote
um
well
so uh Joe Rogan is becoming quite
outspoken about the political situation
and uh he actually says that the Kerry
Lakes election in Arizona
uh he thinks he sees some real reason
for uh let's say distrusting the results
and thinks it's a Banana Republic that
Trump got arrested
now
has Joe Rogan gone completely
um no Democrats watching show
is that what's happened has he turned
into at least like a thorough
you know right-leading conservative
figure
because I I was sort of surprised that
he took such a aggressive public stand
I agree with him on everything but I was
surprised because it seems like it would
be uh
I made the mistake of looking at one
comment from the from X let me read it
it's in all caps
love Joe R he tells the truth and it's
not crazy like Scott Scott is jealous
who isn't jealous of Joe Rogan
okay is there somebody here who's not
jealous of Joe Rogan
I mean seriously
you're not
what's wrong with you maybe you should
see somebody about that
I I feel like the most natural human
feeling would be that you would have
some
some jealousy about somebody who's just
killing it you know just killing it in
life
especially if they're doing something
that you also do but they do it better
than it's been done in the history of
you know Humanity
which is Joe Rogan right now I mean he's
basically
number one in human history for doing
the thing he's doing do you think I
should not feel any jealousy about that
I would say jealousy is the wrong word
though
I think competitive
yeah when I was just sort of auditing my
own feelings about it I think I know
what jealousy and envy feels like
but it feels more like it gets my
competitive Instinct up
makes me wonder about I spent a lot of
time
I spend a lot of time thinking about
what Joe Rogan does and then thinking
about what I do
and and saying all right that's the if
that's the best in class
you know what can I do this more like
that
you should all do that
if you're looking at Joe Rogan and
you're now saying I I need to up my game
because whatever he's doing is working
you should
so I I it doesn't feel like Envy or
jealousy because I don't have like the
bad feeling about it it's more of a
positive
hey he can do this I could do better
you know this this is the perfect
internet dad situation
the the fact that Joe Rogan I find
nothing but inspiring
and I find that he just makes me want to
work harder
give me more of that please please more
of that
so if he makes me envious or jealous in
your opinion in your mind reading
opinion but I process it as just wanting
to work harder because he's setting a
standard and I think we're all good
aren't we
will ban you for being too stupid
mute
it does make you wonder about the
personalities of the all caps shouters
what do you like to meet one in person
just see what they're like in person
I've been thinking about doing that if I
if I could get just one of my trolls
like I've got one troll who who comes on
I think it's been changing accounts and
stuff to tell me that I killed my
stepson
uh by neglect
and I keep wondering I would love to
meet that person in person like actually
I would
because I I just want to know what's
going on
like are they is this somebody who's
broken all the time
and they just treat everybody like this
or are they so you know Weak and
Powerless that they can bother somebody
who's you know got a lot of viewers then
they feel like oh I did something I made
a difference in the world or are they
actually just like
totally broken trolls
and they get pleasure out of you know
creating any pain just say this
I think they're sadists what do you
think do you think they're political or
just sadists
I think they're sadists
how in the world
did that happen no
I think the fun person came back
we're blocking all the all caps people
because they're other silly sadists
but don't take it personally
all right uh what else is happening
so I asked this question how long before
we learned Biden's corruption is the
only reason for the Ukraine war
does anybody asked that question yet
or I feel like I still feel like we're
we're dancing around that question
have you heard anybody in the news say
that directly
that we wouldn't be in the war if we had
a different president because
we had a president who couldn't say no
to Ukraine
so here's the thesis
the only way the war could have been
avoided
is if somebody could give a hard no
to Ukraine and Russia
Trump
Trump could give a hard now to both of
those countries and say you're not going
to have a war
I think Trump could have told them what
they're going to do
yeah here's here's a trump right uh
Putin you've amassed your forces On the
Border you're not going to move them
well what if I do
no you're not
well we we might
you're not
but why are you saying that
are you not hearing me
you're not
and I don't even think Trump would tell
him what he would do I mean he might
throw in some threats but I think he
could just threaten him away he could
literally say you have no idea what I'm
going to do to you you don't know the
depth that I would be willing to go to
if you move one soldier over that line
all the rules are off
what would Putin do if he heard that
imagine Trump saying and just you know
gaming it through imagine if Trump said
if you move one soldier's foot over that
line
all the rules are off
if I were potent I would immediately
stop
because I don't know what that means
what does that mean
like it could be they're gonna actually
kill a Putin
yeah maybe maybe you'll be assassinated
I mean he would he would have no idea
what that means
he would probably mean it you'd probably
not think it was nuclear war but you
never know
now imagine
um and then of course it'd be easy for
uh somebody like a trump
to tell zelinski we're not giving you
jack
I just told him he's not going to put
one foot Over The Line
because if he does all the rules change
so could now this is all hypothetical is
he it's easy to be you know
2020 hindsight
backseat quarterback backseat driver all
that stuff but it does seem to me that
we don't we had the only president who
didn't have a chance of doing that
because
from what we've learned it would seem
that Ukraine has some leverage over
Biden
does that does anybody disagree with
that
it seems to be obvious
that that Ukraine let's say zielinski
specifically would have knowledge of the
Biden that workings in Ukraine and
probably greater knowledge than we have
so far
you don't think that Biden knows that if
he doesn't do everything zelenski wants
there will be some information that
comes out that's bad for Hunter
does anybody think that we know
everything there is to know about
Ukraine
don't you think it's obvious that
Ukraine has some blackmail over Biden at
this point
it's not obvious
now even if he doesn't
imagine he doesn't suppose we've heard
everything there is to hear and if we
heard more it would just be sort of more
of the same and not change anything
Maybe
but are you comfortable are you
comfortable and confident that your
president is working for the benefit of
America
I'm not
tell me one other time
you tell me one other time that America
has been in a war you know in this case
we're supporting it without soldiers but
tell me tell me one other time America
has been in a war
when you weren't sure if the
commander-in-chief was actually on your
team
think about it has that ever happened
before
uh no not El Salvador not Iraq now
here's the thing even if you say you
know Vietnam Iraq they're all bad Wars
they were all allegedly for the benefit
of America
right
we thought I think people genuinely
thought Iraq was some kind of a threat
even if they didn't know there was
weapons of mass destruction it still
looked like you know at least we could
get their oil or something
to me it didn't look like the
commander-in-chief was non-american it
looked like maybe just making some bad
moves
but this looks like Biden protecting his
family and it doesn't look like it had
anything to do with America
that's what it looks like not reading
his mind because I can't but if you look
at the actions you say this does not
look like somebody who's on the side of
America it looks exactly like somebody
protecting his family
and it looks like the entire War
is based on that
so how many days has gone by since the
our crack news industry has found all
the other people who agreed with Joe
Biden that the barisma prosecutor should
be fired because remember he said he was
doing it because all the other entities
you know the international entities
show me one
put one on camera
put any one of the people who agreed
with them before he did it on camera
and just say
um so you thought this was a good idea
can you tell us how much you
independently knew about this prosecutor
were you really following this
prosecutor and in in Ukraine
and then what you probably would hear
would be something like this well it's
not something I was following closely
but we trust that the United States was
so when the United States says you
should back us on this we we kind of got
in line because we trust them
there was nobody who agreed with this
you would have heard from them you don't
think that Biden would have put somebody
on the news you know his team you don't
think they would have produced at least
one person to say Hey you know I'm I'm
Danish
and all everybody over in Europe knew
this guy had to go
because that was the story we were told
right and then you put on the French guy
it's like oh yes we we uh the French we
were so against this prosecutor we are
so glad that he was finally removed
Canada
oh those Canadians they just wanted that
Ukrainian prosecutor removed yeah yeah
Paul gets blocked
poll I blocked people for saying that
Scott is finally waking up
so you're you you were
I think I brought blocked two or three
people every day
for saying he's finally waking up
no I'm not finally waking up
maybe you're finally listening to my
show
but stop saying that dumbass NPC
 you finally wake you up he's
finally waking up
all right
um
let's say all right so here's a
question of the day is did Devin Archer
say that he was selling the illusion of
excess or was that only in the question
who said that that
Devin Archer was selling only the
illusion of access turns out that was
Dan Goldman's question were you only
selling the illusion well but you were
selling the illusion right it was more
about the illusion could you please
agree to with me that it was just the
illusion and then I think Devin said
something like well
not just the illusion yeah yeah so he
wasn't quite buying the you know the
completeness of that statement that it
was the illusion
so of course
we will argue about whether that's true
or false that Devin Archer said he was
selling the illusion
and then here's another part of the
machine that I want to call out so fill
bump who writes from The Washington Post
uh
says that uh
Devin Archer said the opposite of what
Republicans claimed
so so uh Phil bump for the Washington
Post how many how many recognize that
part of the machine
how many know the name Phil bump in the
Washington Post are you familiar with it
all right let me explain
fill bump
is the atom shift
of Eric swalwell's
who writes for the Washington Post
which is the
toilet paper of the news
so did I get that so he's the Adam
Schiff of Eric swalwell's
who writes for the Washington Post which
is the toilet paper of the news
right when when you see Phil bump come
out with something it means that the
Democrats are having a tough time and
they couldn't find anybody who would lie
enough or let me soften that I won't say
lie I couldn't find anybody who would
torture The Narrative enough
that they could get support for their
team so if you have to rely on Phil bump
it means you've lost everything it's
like you're in trouble
uh who could we get to say something
good about us everybody else is hiding
because the news is not in our favor can
we guess somebody who will just say
anything
just say anything and especially
somebody in the Washington Post because
Democrats still think that's a
legitimate publication
imagine being a Democrat and not knowing
that the Washington Post is
imagine not knowing that everything
would be confusing imagine thinking that
the New York Times is intending to tell
you objective truth
imagine thinking that's even their
intention
how confused would you be about
everything
nothing would look right so anyway part
of the machine you should recognize is
the fill bump play maybe I'll even call
it that I'll call it the bump play where
where your narrative has gone so wrong
you can only find one person who's
willing to say you're right Phil bump
by the way Phil bump uh gave me a hard
time when the Washington Post canceled
me he's very much one of the bad guys
at least in my world he's a bad guy
so yeah he has the lowest credibility of
probably anybody in the in the writing
business
that's my opinion
um just my opinion
and wait a minute do I go to can I go to
jail for my opinion
hold on let me see I had an opinion
if somebody else thinks I lied and then
they cancel their subscription
but that wouldn't be politics I don't
know I'm confused
I don't know
looks like I just lost my picture on x
oh
so my
my live stream on X just entered on its
own
that's weird all right so I don't know
if that was a technical problem or what
probably
uh Rasmussen did a poll about Biden and
the possibility of an impeachment and
the support for impeaching Biden has
gone which direction did it go after all
the Devon Archer stuff came out
are people more or less willing to
less willing less willing yeah
does that make sense to you
does it make sense that there's less
support for impeachment
compared to the beginning of the year
all right here's how you could explain
it
he is he's closer to the end of his term
I think there might be less support for
impeachment if he's not going to be
around very long and it's obvious he's
not going to be the next president I
think if he were a real risk to be the
next president
then maybe people would have
you know feel differently
so I think it's time but I also observe
that every time a political leader comes
Under Fire
their base ramps up the support
so do you think it's just a combination
of their their base
uh ramping up support because you know
their their guy is under pressure and
the fact that he's closer to retirement
anyway
yeah it could be the just the vagaries
of polling you know polling's getting
harder and harder to do uh but Rasmussen
has you know looked at these numbers
pretty closely they look like real
opinions it doesn't look like you know
somebody's gaming the system
so we'll see
donut Peach Biden it will only backfire
you might be right about that I get I
don't know if I've ever have I given an
opinion yet
if I ventured an opinion on impeaching
Biden
I don't remember if I have
um so let me form an opinion right now
it does seem to me that the Republicans
could take The High Ground
and say this is clearly impeachable but
will settle for expunging Trump's
impeachment and reset us to where we
were before before this ugliness right
because what you don't want is both
sides perpetually impeaching each other
which is where we're heading
so if the Republicans impeach they've
Now set the standard that all presidents
get impeached the moment the moment
Congress you know is uh in a position to
do it
meaning the other side as the majority
so
the Republicans could take The High
Ground
they could say uh the Trump impeachments
were illegitimate and they expunged them
let's say they get a majority expunge
them
and then say we don't want to re we
don't want to recreate the same problem
that the Democrats did we do believe
that Biden's behavior is beyond the pale
we've described it to you in detail but
let the voters decide
now there are two two schools of thought
and I'm not even entirely sure which one
is right so I'll just put them out there
for you one school of thought is that
you push every Advantage you can and you
try to destroy the other side in every
way you can no matter what and that
would imply impeaching
um I know I hate that point of view
I don't know that it's right
strategically I don't know that it's the
right strategy but I understand you know
I respect that I understand the thinking
I do understand that you got to push
hard or somebody's going to push you I
get it
um but you don't want to use the same
tool for every different situation this
might be a special case because the
other thing you could say is that Biden
is no longer a coherent
you could say that impeaching somebody
who wouldn't know he's being impeached
is buying you nothing
oh that's that's the good high ground
The High Ground would be you don't
impeach somebody who's that degraded oh
that's it
that's it that's the narrative The
Narrative is Republicans don't do this
and by the way
you you can't impeach somebody who
couldn't defend himself
that that is a good frame because it's
actually true I don't think in my
opinion I don't think you should impeach
somebody who's that degraded I think I
think you either time him out you know
just replace them in a normal order of
things or if his own team wants to take
him out sooner that's their own decision
but having the Republicans press
somebody who's just really not capable
at this point
feels like
you know just beating a baby harp seal
it just feels like it's not a fair fight
anymore
now I get it that he that Biden is still
fighting hard
so you know you shouldn't get a free
pass but you might have a better framing
of saying you're above it
say you're above it might be exactly
what the what the country wants to hear
do you think the country wants to hear
we've got to stop doing the impeachments
I think people would say they want to
hear it but I don't know if they do
because they might like impeaching the
other other team but not their own team
now if they expect Republicans to be
weak
yeah but is it weakness so here here's
the central question
is trying to impeach
Biden showing strength or weakness
because to me if if let's say somebody
has a mental weakness and they come up
and slap you in the face
would you be showing strength by hitting
the back
or strength by saying okay I could take
a hit let's deal with it let's deal with
this as humans which one makes you look
strong
yeah you really have to you have to
think this through because I think you
could sell Biden as as too degraded to
impeach and that's actually a stronger
that's much stronger
uh messaging I think
but you're right it all what the only
factor is what the public perceives if
the public perceives that's too weak
then I guess it wouldn't work
but I don't know that they would
I see somebody calling themselves Rob
Reiner but not the real one
you're fine with President Kamala and
might say it's about time
you're not the real Rob Reiner are you
I don't think so
um
all right slimy Joe I don't know
yeah in my analogy the the crazy person
is someone who
um they they can defend themselves
I mean they did the first lap but it
just wouldn't be a fair fight
so it's all about it not being a fair
fight and that's all
so you should not take the
um so here's a perfect example
if my argument was the analogy
then this week
but I don't need the analogy to make the
argument
that you don't want to attack a weak
person in public
right you don't need the analogy so
here's the analogy is just packaging the
point it's not making the point it's
just packaging it
so don't argue the analogy argue with
the logic of it
does that make sense
don't argue the marketing of it that's
just the analogy is just an easy way to
remember it that just think about the
logic of it
all right uh 81 million that we can see
impeaching Garland
might make sense
I do wonder about him
there are some things that Garland needs
to explain to all of us
wouldn't you say
all right
