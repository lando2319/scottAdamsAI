do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and are
you glad you're here whoa what a good
day we're gonna have
and if you'd like your day to be kicked
off to I don't know levels that nobody's
ever heard of in the history of hearing
about things all you need is a cup or a
mug or glass a tanker cello sustain a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's a
dopamine the other day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
ah
well what's going on here oh here's some
good news uh Greenland is back in play
so as you know I'm sure all of you are
up to date on your green land history
but in 1979
um
the Greenland did gain its autonomy from
Denmark
but not entirely it's got a little bit
of autonomy that it needs to get back
because Denmark still runs some stuff
over there and they're putting together
a little draft of the Constitution to
get Denmark out of their business so the
Greenland would be an independent
country
let's hear it from Greenland potential
future independent completely
independent country
now
this brings us to the following question
what is the total size and capacity of
the Greenland military
I wonder what kind of invasion Force
they could
repel
well
um I've never before considered
conquering a foreign country
but I feel like
if I could give 50 volunteers I think we
could make a run at it anybody want to
run their own country
we gotta make sure it gets free of
Denmark first
but then wide open people it's wide open
you know what I would do if I were Trump
when he becomes president I mean if he
becomes president
I would make a deal with Greenland to
provide them a an umbrella of National
Defense
in return for
making sure that we have some let's say
ability to keep them from falling into
Russian and Chinese hands because I
think we're going to end up defending
him right
I mean One Way Or Another We're going to
be basically their military
we should get something out of that deal
all right how many of you are afraid of
the so-called 15-minute cities
we got to talk about this people we have
to talk about this
now let me tell you what a 15 minutes it
is
so I think the world economic forum and
maybe others have talked about the idea
of creating cities and I think they mean
creating new cities in which you don't
need your own car
and everything's technologically tied to
everything so everything works really
well and basically the garbage gets
picked up and transportation is easy and
it's cheap and everybody's happy and
they're 15 minutes now the 15-minute
City means you can walk everywhere you
need to walk in 15 minutes so you can go
get your groceries if you need to et
cetera
no freedom
all right let's talk about that if you
have a 15-minute City
your problem is you would have no
Freedom right
all right how many of you believe that
the 15-minute City would we would be
built with no accommodation for leaving
the city
do you think they wouldn't wouldn't
think of the fact that sometimes people
need to go places
do you really believe that they want to
keep you in the city
I mean seriously
do you really believe that
you you don't think that they would
think of that
hey we're building this city
there's a possibility well I don't know
how likely it is but some of the people
in the city might want to let me just
try this on for size
leave the city sometimes oh no oh no if
we build you a 15-minute City you don't
get to leave
what will I want to live you know I'd
like to leave oh no no we're taking your
car away
well I'll just call somebody to come get
me good luck we're going to control your
phone
well how do I get out of the city you
don't get out of the city we're going to
control you and if you don't take
vaccinations you'll never go anywhere
I don't think we're going to build a
city that doesn't let you out
how many of you think that's really
going to happen
they're really going to build a city
that doesn't let you out
all right here's another objection I
heard just before I get went live
somebody said I don't like this idea of
a car is available whenever I want it
you know it's like an Uber I don't like
that idea I want to have my own car and
my own driveway for freedom what do you
think your own car as opposed to these
public cars that are available on demand
your own car gives you some Freedom
doesn't it
exactly yeah if you have your own car
you can go anywhere you want very unlike
the uh the transportation that they're
offering to give you right if you had
your own car
you could drive that thing anywhere you
want within the city
now if you had a car service you could
also get those cars to take you anywhere
you want but there's a question of
availability right availability that's
an issue because if you have your own
car about five days a year it's
unavailable to you because it's in
service
as opposed to the public cars are
available all the time
you'd like to increase your freedom by
having your own automobile which you pay
extra for and is available fewer days
per year
because you like your freedom
no I'm not joking does that sound like a
joke I have a private car
so I can go anywhere right except for
five days a year
five days a year I can't go anywhere in
my car
because it's in the shop
but if I didn't own a car I would have
100 availability of Transportation
but you say to yourself Scott when your
car is in the shop you could take the
public transportation
which I could do anytime
I don't understand any of this there's
nothing about the fear of the 15-minute
City that I understand on a conceptual
level I'm not saying I disagree don't
get me wrong
if you say Scott you disagree with me
that's not happening I actually don't
understand it
so I can't disagree with it it doesn't
there's nothing to disagree with
so the idea is that there's
they
a group that you call they
and that they want to control you would
you agree
how many would agree with the statement
that they they want to control you
and at the 15-minute city is part of how
they're going to do it
now that doesn't
that doesn't sound crazy to you at all
does it
that there's a mysterious day
who are in control and they and what
they need is mostly they need to control
you
many of you believe that
right that there's a they
all right let me tell you my view of the
world
if there were a they I would know it
I I have been behind the curtain long
enough to know there's no they
there is no they
there's just a whole bunch of people
looking out for themselves
a whole bunch of people just looking out
for themselves that's it that's that's
everything
do you think that the world economic
Forum when it brings all the CEOs
together
have you ever seen a group of CEOs
have any of you ever been in a group of
CEOs
if you haven't
don't be afraid of they
if you have here's what you would learn
they're all different people with
different incentives and different plans
and different Ambitions they're not
working together
now okay you so you
 you
right that's that's not where I needed
to see some anti-Semitism right there
right there there's not a Jewish cabal
this ruin that's running the
world
that is not happening
right and honestly it just pisses me off
when I see that it just pisses me off
it's just a bunch of people looking out
for themselves
sometimes do people work together sure
like if a real specific deal
between two powerful people do you know
how many lawyers they get involved for
that
if two powerful people want to do
anything together
it's like lawyered up like crazy there's
no way there's some cabal of people I
know the anti-semitic people are going
nuts over here so you could just jerk
off to your anti-semitic beliefs all you
want let's just not include it in this
conversation because it's crazy talk
okay it's just crazy talk
now
if you're saying that some groups look
out for themselves
sure
you know that would be universally true
but there's no they
there is no they
there is however
collections of effects which have an
impact on us
which look almost planned
right
um
so here's my question how many of you
think you're going to be paying for
things
in 50 years with pieces of paper that
you carry in your wallet
how many do you think you're going to be
paying for things with pieces of paper
in 50 years
nobody
so you're arguing about something that
can't change
don't argue about something that can't
change
we will have digital money
I know there are there are downsides to
digital money and I don't disagree
but it's not going to not happen there's
100 chance you'll be paying for stuff
with digital money
so we just have to figure out how to
deal with it trying to stop it is just
crazy
learning to deal with it might be useful
you know figure out how to make it safe
but in stopping it that's not going to
happen
how about about identification
digital ID
we already have digital ID
it's basically here they could take a
picture of your face they know exactly
who you are
right it's called Clearview it's an app
that the police have they just take a
picture of your face they've got digital
ID they've had it for a long time
how about uh they'll stop you from
traveling
do you think that there's a they who
wants to stop you from traveling
do you know who they are they are people
who make money when you travel
there is no they who wants you to stay
home they all want you to travel like
crazy the more you travel the more you
spend the more they make they make money
when you go do stuff when you're
productive they don't make money when
you're staying home or
they can't make money that way
yeah no there's no but there is no they
who wants to lock you up in a 15-minute
City
there is no they who wants you not to
have transportation 100 of the time
it doesn't exist
you can take your paper money and your
own personal car and you have less
things you can buy and fewer places you
can go
that's your choice I mean you can do
that
but
so here's
here's what I'd like to uh
I guess we have to do the analogy
there's no way around it
because you're going to say to me Scott
you were wrong about the pandemic right
are you going to say that Scott you were
so wrong about the pandemic
do you know what I said about the
pandemic
I said that the pandemic restrictions
would go away after the pandemic did
they
they did the pandemic restrictions went
away after the pandemic exactly like I
told you they would you thought that we
were all going to be you know to have
digital digital IDs and vaccines and all
kinds of none of that happened
now also I I've seen some comparisons to
other countries we're not other
countries
we are not other countries
so if Great Britain is taking the
freedom away from their citizens they
can't because those citizens are unarmed
if they try that here it goes different
that's why we are America
we we put up with a massive amount of
internal death
because of our gun ownership
and we do that so you can't with us
like the government has a limit to what
they can do and we and we pay for that
with a huge amount of innocent life
and we think it's worth the price
so I'm not really worried about the
thing there's no they under the rug none
of these powerful people work together
right even even if you look at any group
of powerful people how about Republicans
are those Republicans all working
together
the Republicans all one unified they no
not even Republicans agree with each
other how about the Democrats are they a
unified Progressive no they're not
you know RFK Jr is different than Biden
who's different than AOC
there is no they
and there never will be there will never
be a they
and I've been captured
how many people think I've been captured
by the the they
might pop out of the day
is that what you think
people say yes
how would they Capture Me what would
they do with money
did they Capture Me by canceling me
world of worldwide
am I now saying what the what they wants
to say because my entire career was
destroyed by
people in power
so so now I'm I'm doing their bidding
because they took away my livelihood is
that what's happening
have you met me
do you know anything about me
that that could not be a dumber
hypothesis
that I would go along and I'm just going
along
I don't think you've met anybody less
likely to just go along
that's not in my DNA
it is funny all right it is funny
but how would they Capture Me
well like how would they do it threaten
me
bribed me how would they do it
talk about something else I think it's
time
all right
um
the reason I was talking about it
because I saw Jordan Peterson agreeing
that
when somebody said they won't let you
leave Jordan Peterson said that's the
plan Stan
so Jordan Peterson also believes the
15-minute cities
are a threat
uh I would love to talk to him about
that because I don't get it at all like
generally
generally when Jordan Peterson makes a
assertion
even if I disagree with it I understand
it
and usually I don't disagree with it
he's generally right on point
but this one I don't understand don't
even see the raising behind it
all right I saw Kara Swisher ago after
um
who is she going after uh
 this story is not going to make any
sense unless I can remember his name in
the next minute
Saks yes David sacks thanks so uh you've
probably noticed on Twitter and in the
world in General David Sachs is sort of
emerged as one of those
prominent voices
um Elon Musk seems to have some
Association oh I guess they work
together in PayPal so so they've had a
long Association
um
but here he made a comment in a tweet
about uh
there are lots of jobs or there were
layoffs or something you said he wasn't
seeing it
so something about jobs he wasn't seeing
locally so Kara Swisher who would be
identified with the Democrats
she mocks him because he said something
about his personal observation
of the job situation right he just said
his personal observation he wasn't
making a claim what's true he's just
saying that what the news says isn't
matching what he observes
is that fair is it fair to say that what
the news is claiming about the job
situation is not what he's personally
observing
he didn't say
it was just a question like why am I not
observing what you're saying I think
that's a good tweet
Karis Wisher says
mocking him international relations
expert political strategist San
Francisco detective interviewer and now
Economist 2 Tech dudes have apparently
decided to become the Swiss Army knives
of our world Pro tip on the Larry
Summers cosplaying even though I would
not okay it just goes on
now here's the question do you think AI
could identify Democrats by the way they
tweet
do you think you could
I think you could
and
I'm not I'm not sure of the next thing
I'm going to say because confirmation
bias is a so I may be suffering
confirmation bias but you can tell me
maybe you've maybe you don't
is it my imagination
that when uh people who lean right or at
least are friendly to the right and not
unfriendly to the right because I'm not
going to say David sacks leans right
because I don't see that
you know he feels like a Centrist who's
just sort of looking at the data but
anybody who's
let's say middle or right
they tend to talk about the policy and
what will happen right our last
conversation was about the they in the
cities and the policies and your freedom
those are issues
did I just lose sound
oh mood
um uh
so here's what I notice
the David Sachs tweet is about
unemployment
and whether the the data and the reality
are matching up
that's about a thing that's about the
world
the Karis Wisher
a comment is about David sacks
those are not the same
right and I I feel like I see this in
the tweets over and over again now of
course the people on the right
do make fun of characters on the left
you know the the atom shifts and stuff
like that but when but if you say that
Adam Schiff is a liar
that's actually
proven
I mean we've actually had
you know major investigations to prove
that he's a liar so I'm not sure that
that's unfair
if you say that he goes into the skiff
and then tells you he saw something that
wasn't there that's not exactly a
personal attack
not exactly because it's a description
of an actual thing that we can all
verify
but the stuff that the Kara Swisher type
attack
where she just mocks somebody's General
ability
without pointing out anything he did
wrong
what did he do wrong
what did David sacks do wrong
do you have an example did he get
something wrong on all of these
categories international relations
expert political strategist
was he wrong on all those things
or is she simply describing somebody who
has a very impressive Talent stack
somebody who can talk about economics
and international relations in a
intelligent way
who is looking at the data that is
available to us and trying to derive
opinions based on what we observe
I I don't know how you hate that it's
hard for me to Imagine That Somebody
went after him
now to be fair
the right also goes after Greta dunberg
right
and usually mocking her for being a
young woman who's you know they think
he's not up on the facts or whatever
they're saying
but that again is sort of a special case
where it was a child
uh a child literally at one point not no
longer a child but a minor trying to do
the flu is world events in something
that she couldn't possibly have
understood
that feels different
than an adult who is you know
accomplished and understands the world
talking about the world
all right
well so RFK Jr is having trouble getting
on Instagram because every time he puts
in his campaign email address he gets
banned for 180 days without even getting
an account
do you think that's just a mistake
or do you think facebook slash Instagram
slash meta is really trying to keep him
off Instagram
I don't know it looks like a
coincidental mistake that coincidentally
goes in the direction you would expect
the coincidences to go
so
I don't know we'll keep an eye on that
but he'll probably get on Instagram
um I guess RFK Jr agreed with musk to do
his spaces
so that should
that should help the uh at least the
open-mindedness of musk because remember
musk invited every presidential
candidate to do a spaces and uh RFK Jr
would be uh
Democrat so we now have a mainstream
looking Republican DeSantis and a
mainstream sort of uh Democrat
I like that
I like that that's that's where I want
to see
Twitter going
do you know there are still people was
it Ben Jerry's who decided they were
going to leave Twitter
because it become full of hate
have anybody noticed that have you seen
a lot of extra hate on Twitter
because I haven't noticed
I I feel like there's less
but the less is because I feel there are
fewer uh paid trolls coming after me
I would say the number of paid obviously
paid trolls coming after me is way down
does anybody have that same experience
maybe it's for the bigger accounts does
anybody notice that the trolls are less
but I wonder if there's more trolls that
are trolling
the political left
maybe they're just fewer trolls on
people like me and more drills of other
people
Maybe
I know now it doesn't look worse but it
does look a little different
I would say Twitter looks different but
not worse because you can say things now
that you couldn't say before but I
suppose honesty looks like
hate
to some people honestly they would look
the same
all right um
so uh
I would like to uh pick up on a point I
made before I saw Greg duffel talk about
this as well but I call this the Bob
Dole play
I told you the story about Bill Clinton
and when he and Al Gore were running
against Bob Dole Bob Dole was hard to
beat because he was a beloved older
World War II vet you know the greatest
Generation Etc
and the Way Clinton dismissed Dole Is
rather than going hard at him he went at
him respectfully respecting his service
respecting his contribution but
basically hinting that his time was over
yeah you did a good job and now it's
time to think of the future
so the the approach was to instead of go
hard at Dole which could have gotten
some pushback because people loved him
even if you didn't think he was he was
presidential material he was very
lovable I mean just a lovable guy right
so you didn't want to go hard at a
lovable guy so he just sort of
patronized him great job uh thank you
for your service Pat in the head but now
now leave the future to the younger
people we'll take care of this
but I noticed that Trump is using that
play on by them and Biden's cognitive
abilities
uh shamelessly telling Hannity that he
told Hannity not to make fun of that
because it's not funny
which is just beautiful persuasion is
beautiful like to see to see Trump
um and I think he I think he got away
with it I think he got away
with saying that whatever's going on
here is not funny because again that's
making you think past the sale
Biden's dementia
is it fun to make fun of it or is it not
funny oh I made you think past a sale
that he has dementia
not only did it make you think past the
sale that my my opponent has dementia
but I made you think that I'm not the
kind of person who would who would uh
mock that because that's something you
can't control
and if Trump is in the
you know takes the position of I'm not
going to mock something that a person
can't control
oh my God that's good I would love him
to say that I love him to say I I don't
want to I don't you shouldn't make fun
of things that people don't have control
over and he definitely doesn't have
control over dementia if he has it and
it looks like he does
so
that's just perfect like you can't get
better than that
uh
somebody thinks I've whined about being
canceled
all right let's take a vote have I
whined about being canceled
does anybody see me whine
no you're imagining it and you know what
it also shows that you're probably a
Democrat
because instead of talking about any
issues you thought that the one thing
that was worth saying
was something about me personally
nothing about my opinions nothing about
the news nothing about the policies of
the country you just have to say
something negative about me my
personality that that's all you had
that's all you had
think about yourself go back and go back
to your little Democrat hole where all
you care about is people's personalities
and uh
you know that's enough about you
um
Trump has congratulated Kim Jong-un
for being granted a position on the
World Health Organization executive
board
oh now this is what you call
a thriver
this might be the first three furry
you've ever seen you know what a twofer
is you get two benefits instead of one
this is a three for
number one
Trump remains friends with Kim Jong-un
right
so so Trump remains unfriendly terms
with Kim Jong-un should he become
president very useful very useful so
that's one
number two uh
he gets everybody talking about it so he
gets publicity for saying the thing
you're not supposed to say right so now
he's got a bunch of publicity for it
that's two
now do you hate the fact that uh Trump
could be buddies with Kim Jong-un
that that literally takes the risk of
nuclear nuclear war off the table
all they have to do is get along and
there's really no risk of nuclear war at
all he could just take it off the table
but the best part of this
by far is the three firm
where he's congratulating him for being
part of the World Health Organization
what do you think Trump thinks of the
World Health Organization
he's he's making fun of the World Health
Organization at the same time he's
complimenting his buddy at the same time
he's getting publicity
it's a three-four it's beautiful it's
just beautiful
and everybody would be all upset about
it
and the more upset people are about it
that he's backing Kim Jong-un yes
is going to remind you that he can get
along with uh he can get along with
anybody you know like Putin president XI
and you can just get along with anybody
which is what people are looking for
they're looking for somebody who can get
along with them the leaders not I have a
nuclear war with them haha
oh that made me laugh all right
uh I would like to uh confess some
ignorance and a mistake that I made
but when um
when I got first canceled
Glenn Lowry
who's a podcaster an economist had
offered to talk to me right after and I
wasn't wasn't going to do too many
interviews so I declined however after
seeing Glenn Glenn Lowry in action I
guess he's over in Oxford where he was
giving some talking to some folks uh I
really should have done that interview
he's a freaking smart guy and I didn't
realize he was an economist until today
when I saw the Tweet but economists are
definitely different animals
and he made a point that
and you need to know he's black for the
purpose of this story right the story
doesn't make sense unless you know he's
black I hate I ain't doing that
but the story requires it unfortunately
like
I don't know it just feels creepy
to mention somebody's gender or their
ethnicity before you tell a story about
how awesome they are like that doesn't
feel right somehow we have to get past
that
but in this story it's essential because
he was talking about
um
the disconnect
between these two Notions which are both
held to be true
all right this is held to be true
uh cultures are very different
and that people are proud of their
culture and their culture is distinct
would you agree
there are groups who say yes my culture
my culture and my culture is distinct it
doesn't act the way you act we act
differently
that's the whole point of a culture the
culture means you act differently if you
acted the same it wouldn't be a culture
it would be everybody acting the same
so on one hand you want to say we have a
culture and it's different from yours
and then Glenn Lowry points out
that you also want the outcomes to be
the same
and he points out that logically there
is no situation where that could ever
occur you can't have people acting
differently and getting the same
outcomes
now that is smart
and that's that's the economist part
coming out like that's what makes him an
economist that is just smart there's no
other way to describe that and
I wondered why I had never heard that
before
because as soon as you hear it you go
okay that's permanently part of my
thinking now I'm now completely changed
because I can never go forward without
thinking that that's just so clean and
and precise
and
I just love it I don't I I just He also
mentioned Thomas Soul yeah so he he did
a uh homage to Thomas soul
um
say about that DeSantis did a good job
with a heckler
um some some either gay activists or
possibly uh maybe an ally of some kind
was in his audience and yelled at him
and this was regarding the so-called
don't say gay laws which are really
don't say gay laws but that's another
question but it was about that topic and
the person in the audience yelled you're
an effing fascist
uh
and here's what this Heather said well
thank you to Santa said we're not going
to let you impose an agenda on our kids
we're going to stand up for our kids
we're going to make sure to do it right
and then he said those people like that
in Florida are the people we beat every
single day on policy
um we're not going to let you
indoctrinate our kids
so here's what was beautiful about it
the Hackler attacked DeSantis
and DeSantis said you can attack me all
you want I'm still going to protect your
children
that's pretty good that's really good
because there were a hundred ways he
could have done that wrong
he could have talked about you know
policy or he could have asked the
Heckler to be
taken out or he could have said you
misunderstand my policy or you're
misinterpreting me there were a hundred
ways he could have done that wrong the
right answer was stay away from our kids
you can't beat that stay away from our
kids
wow and he got a standing ovation I can
I can see why
um speaking of trump again he's
introduced a new word we'll see if this
catches on but instead of calling the
Maga supporters
Mega he wants to call them megadonians
megadonians
which has Jessica Vaughn pointed out on
Twitter has the advantage of the word
Dawn right in the middle Dom they're
Mega donians
is that a coincidence I don't know
uh here's the story
I got the this is more evidence that
we've reached Peak wokeness
you tell me if this is not evidence of
peak wokeness I'll just give you the
headline you don't even need to know the
details
U.S military uh
uh let's say Joe Biden's Administration
has stopped the U.S military bases for
hosting drag shows
the US military was going to host drag
shows
now just to be clear
you could do a drag show anywhere you
want yeah I'm okay with adults doing any
kind of legal entertainment and enjoying
it as such so nope I have no problem
with drag shows but do they have to be
everywhere
the does a drag show just literally have
to be everywhere you can't have any
place that you go without a drag show
and again no problem with drag shows
people should Express themselves as
theatrically and in any entertaining way
they want if people want to see it
that's great you know if we're talking
about adults
but even Joe Biden's Administration
uh couldn't put up with hosting drag
shows on the military base now tell me
I'm wrong
we've reached the top
right when Biden is telling them to cut
out the drag shows we have reached the
top
we found out how far this thing can go
and that's how far it can go and now
we're done
all right
uh the news today said that the U.N
climate agency
picked its first woman leader
how about that
yeah
there's sort of two stories there two
stories that they'd like us to know and
this is important not only do they have
a new leader for the climate stuff at
the U.N new leader so that would be news
by itself
just all by itself but on top of the
fact it's a new leader
the leader has a vagina
and that was the headline
yeah how would you like
how would you like to achieve this level
of success the the woman who got this
job this must be one of like most
prestigious
respectable things you could ever do I
mean it's really like a a crown in your
achievements and what does the news talk
about her vagina right no not her
success not her not her background not
all of her capabilities nothing about
her Talent stack uh how she's worked
hard to get here how she's going to
change things how her her opinions will
maybe guide the guide the organization
nothing like that no it had to be that
she has a vagina
that's what we needed to know and by the
way we know she has one because if
if she did not have one the news would
have told us am I right
if she did not have a vagina the news
would have told us that specifically
they were sad you know born biological
male but now trans woman and then you
would know well I mean they might even
tell you if there's surgery or not
so yes we don't care about her abilities
or any of her talents we don't care
about the hard work she's put in
but does she or does she not have a
vagina that's the headline right there
ladies and gentlemen
now once again I give you
Peak wokeness
is it not Peak wokeness when a a woman
with high credentials gets a high job
and we're talking about her vagina
that's that's the top of the craziness
right we have reached Peak
ridiculousness
Peak ridiculousness
all right
um
looks like Amazon is noodling over
offering cheap wireless service
which is made stock prices go up and
down now they didn't say a phone
so it just says wireless service and
somehow they're negotiating with Verizon
and dish
to piggyback on their capacity
now I never really understand why
Verizon would sell excess capacity to a
competitor
so maybe it's because I think it'll be a
low end service
so it's not really competitive I don't
know I'm not sure what the thinking is
but I don't know if it's going to happen
but I would say that Jeff Bezos
if he's assuming that he's running the
show uh his instincts are really good
that's the that's the understatement of
the century isn't it Jeff Bezos has good
instincts
that's like the understatement of all
understatements yeah yeah he has good
instincts okay let's let's give him that
um this is the exact time for Amazon to
get into the mobile phone
business you know why
because of AI
AI is going to kick the out of all
the established players every
everything's just going to get stirred
yeah he's jumping in just when the pot
is all going to get stirred which means
he could end up with you know nice
little bowl of soup there taking my
analogy to its conclusion so
again you know Amazon's one of my
favorite companies to watch
for excellence in execution
do you ever notice how good the Amazon
software Works to the point where you
stop thinking about it
it's it's almost the only software
that's ever done that for me Amazon
software is so good
that I don't think about it I don't
think about the interface I just use it
and that's actually unusual
you know even when I use my iPhone you
know the apps I'm still like wrestling
with the interface you got to kind of
put some work into it and then if it
makes you work but
Amazon software just works I mean that
freaking stuff just works and it's fast
you know when was the last time you went
to Amazon and it didn't pop up
like it just didn't work
it doesn't happen
Twitter sometimes doesn't work Instagram
so it doesn't work Facebook but I can't
even think of a Time Amazon didn't work
that company knows how to get stuff done
so if they're if they're entering the
mobile phone area just when AI is the
thing and I think they're going to have
a pretty good take on AI
could be really interesting
could be
well we're all waiting for the Ukraine
spring offensive which
I don't think it's going to happen in
the spring looks like it might be a
summer offensive but I read a uh one
military analyst opinion of this and I
thought it was worth repeating
and the idea is that you need a five to
one uh people advantage to attack an
established protected Place five to one
but the ukrainians certainly don't have
five to one compared to the the Russian
troops on the border
so how could they possibly win when they
don't have anywhere near the number of
people say all military experts say they
need
other people say three to one yes I'll
correct that to three to one to five to
one depending on who you're talking to
but you did at least three to one
but a military expert pointed this out
they're not going to attack everywhere
it's not like all the ukrainians on one
side are going to start running at all
the Russians on the other side
that's not gonna happen because then
they don't have the three to one
what they're going to do is amass their
best people and Assets in one place
where they will have a three to one
advantage and they'll push through
now as they push through
all hell breaks let loose right because
then they can get behind the Lions and
who knows what happens at them
so the ukrainians according to one
expert absolutely have everything they
need to push through so they they could
make a break in the line now what do
they do with it
yeah I mean a lot of people die of
course
um I don't know what they do with it
would they try to encircle I know Crimea
or something
I don't know where that's going but the
uh
they also rumors have it that they've
been getting drones like crazy and that
the number of drones that the ukrainians
might have at their uh at their beck and
call could be in the thousands
so they may they might just have swarms
at this point
so we have not yet seen our first full
swarm
drone War have we correct me if I'm
wrong have we seen a full swarm
where where a thousand drones just come
out and and and I just own a
we have have we somebody says yes but if
if it's happened maybe it happened in
some smaller action where there was no
news coverage
yeah
here's what I think and what the one
expert thinks that the uh the drones
might change everything because imagine
you're the Russian military
and imagine you're not a Wagner group
because they seem to be pretty badass I
suppose you're the regular conscription
don't want to be their Russian military
and you're you're on the front lines and
you're guarding something you don't care
about at all you're not even guarding
the Homeland you're guarding some land
you stole from Ukraine or however you
think about it but but you're not really
invested in it
suddenly
you find out that the ukrainians have
decided to break through where you are
oh no
they have five to one on us right here
even though they don't have five to one
everywhere
and then suddenly the sky just turns
dark
with drones
it just turns dark
what the hell are you gonna do you're
gonna stay and fight
not if you're smart because they're
gonna win
so fighting wouldn't even make sense you
might as well just get out of the way
I I think the ukrainians might be
gearing up
to be able to project such overwhelming
force on small areas that the small area
will just retreat
and that they can just own anything they
want to own as long as they take one at
a time
and it doesn't look to me like the
Russians have the ability to do offense
anymore
or else they'd be doing it right we
haven't seen much in the way of offense
in fact even buckmut
the Wagner Wagner groups you know with
tremendous losses they take it over
um do you think it was a good idea to
take over a buck moot
I think that was the worst idea anybody
ever had because whoever owned a back
moot would own the territory
with no civilians to protect them
there's no civilians
so basically Ukraine can just look at
them from the sky at whoever is
controlling buckmut and just kill them
at their leisure just pick them off all
day long which I'm sure they're doing
with artillery and everything else so
basically Baku became a place where
regular Russian military go to die
because there's nothing to conquer
because they already own it
so they're not conquering it nor are
they defending it because nobody wants
it
at this point who would want to put
their military there because then
they're just a Target and they're not
they're not getting anything they're
just a Target
so somehow the ukrainians have managed
to bait the Russian army to hold bakmut
which they sort of have to hold because
if they lose it it's going to be a big
psychological blow they have to hold it
but there's no ukrainians to fight
there's no ukrainians there to kill it's
just a bunch of people who went to the
same place so you know where to target
them so the artillery can just pick them
off now if I had to guess
the the regular Russian military that's
holding buckmut they might be dying in
very large numbers and Ukraine might be
just well just keep picking them off
until we're ready for our offensive
but it is starting to look like the
ukrainians have more punch
uh than we imagined
however
I like to bookend everything I say about
Ukraine with the following nobody knows
what's happening over there
nobody knows
it could be the Ukraine is on the the
verge of surrender
I wouldn't know how would I know
so don't believe anything don't believe
anything that you hear about Ukraine
about how strong they are how they're
offensive will or will not work none of
it's believable
I'm just giving you my best take from
you know more for entertainment than for
knowledge
so so that you can track my best guesses
so my best guess is this
way more drones than anybody thought
and
when the ukrainians push they're going
to break through the Russian lines like
a hot poker through butter
why they do it I don't know yet
because because I don't know what the
Breakthrough would buy them exactly
but I maybe to surround stuff maybe
maybe to surround some troops make them
surrender I don't know
there must be some reason to break
through a line
you don't want a Battle of the Bulge
situation where they break through and
get surrounded
uh cut off Crimea
cut off Crimea and then take your time
getting it back because you can cut it
off if you cut off Crimea
you could cut off their supply lines
right then you just take your time
getting it back
I don't know well
that ladies and gentlemen is the light
Saturday fair was there any topic I
missed that you're just
you're just dying to hear about
Crimea has all the ports yeah so it'd be
hard to cut it off but you could I think
you could cut off the maritime trade
uh ground troops superiority no war was
ever won without ground troop
superiority
that's a good point
uh it was yeah back was originally a
Ukrainian meat grinder that's true but
now it's a Russian meat grinder
yeah don't spend your time on knowledge
uh Ukraine I have to go through 15 mile
wide of Russian defense line do they or
or do those 15 miles of Defense collapse
because they don't have any chance of
winning
so yeah I feel like Ukraine might be
playing for a surrender
let me put it this way not the surrender
of Russia
but I feel like the ukrainians might be
trying to beef up to the point where
they can make any you know any small
geographical Russian territory Just
Surrender
we'll see
uh we defeated Japan without boots okay
well I guess that uh that completely
debunks the other thing
I read a comment that nobody's ever you
know won a war without boots on the
ground you know military superiority
and then the the the example of uh Japan
was given okay never mind yes there was
that one time we didn't put any boost on
the ground and totally won
we're getting bad War news that is
correct we're getting bad warnings you
shouldn't believe anything I say about
Ukraine or Russia if there's anything I
can tell you for sure don't believe me
on that
we didn't fight the Japanese on the
islands that's true
uh what's that rfkg of you to do all it
was very informative okay
how is uh Ukraine getting all the
technical expertise well allegedly is
from NATO
but
don't you assume that NATO Fighters just
change their
change their uniforms and
they're just operating the equipment
I have trouble believing the actual
ukrainians are operating on the
high-tech equipment
I feel like there might be some people
who just put on different uniforms if
you don't I mean
all right
uh oh the classified documents hoax
well there's nothing new on that
open AI proposes using systems over
goals to solve well hello
process supervisioned
oh yeah
so
um as you know Ai hallucinates and it
will just make up stuff but you can also
use the same IA AI that made up stuff
to check its own stuff and tell you that
it was made up
how it does that I don't know
but now I guess they can have it sort of
continually checking its work
so that by the time you see it it's
already fact checked it which would be a
big Improvement
I I think I said that right
uh
Pence was cleared of his document stuff
yeah Trump said he's at least as
innocent as Pence but I think those
situations are different
now didn't we hear that the document
that Trump was referring to on an audio
they can't find
oh my God
I just saw a beam I don't believe
what's that
um
Trump is the one who can clear himself
yeah that is different
will I worship AGI as a god
well if I have to
all right
ladies and gentlemen Ronnie Spears can
all right
your fans know your true abilities it's
true
modern education no
I have not seen it
all right I'm just looking at your
comments now
um
they say Pence might run he is running
you think drag is a fetish of
hypersexuality somebody said
I don't know what Jack is
I do not know
if it isn't sexuality or gender identity
why is it LGBT
somebody says
I don't know
I don't know I just I just feel like
we're at the peak and all the wokeness
stuff is going to decline
now that it may be because there's a you
know Republican Administration coming
into
office I think
all right um
drag is bad lip syncing
you know a guy I knew really well
um I've been to the house lots of times
blah blah blah became a drag performer
in San Francisco
and it was the weirdest thing because it
just came out of nowhere
he was just a guy at the party
and the next thing he knew he was a
famous very well uh attended
somewhat well-known
drag performer in San Francisco
so he just had a different identity he
would he would take
did not see it coming I have to say
all right
um after one can of Bud Light
uh recent Millions upon millions of
illegal males what about it
um
here Dragon SF must be really
competitive
well I don't know I'm not sure what he
presents himself in terms of his
sexuality
I just know he presents himself as a
as a woman playing the piano and singing
you think Bud Light is done it might be
uh
Kennedy versus Trump who would win
um Kennedy
Academy did I don't think the Democrats
have figured that out yet
in my opinion Trump beats Biden I know
the Democrats think differently but I
think Trump beats Biden
but I think
Kennedy would be Trump because I think
all the Democrats want is somebody who's
going to be alive
that's it they just want somebody who
has a has a good chance of surviving 48
years and they don't think that that's
Biden
so you put in you give him any Democrat
who is a real Democrat and I think they
vote for him
all right
CIA would kill Kennedy before he could
expose the truth
maybe but you know the the truth that he
wants to expose would be people with
longer retired
so I doubt there's anybody still at the
CIA that would be a problem
I see people agreeing Trump beats Biden
Kennedy beats Trump so yeah it's like
Paper Rock Scissors but the Democrats
haven't figured it out or they can't
execute because Biden has too much
control
yeah the nuns are right so the San
Francisco has these this group The
Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence
who are what would you call them what's
the proper name they are are they
biological men dressed as nuns right
but they they don't present themselves
as female they present themselves as a
parody am I right
they're a parody they're not that's not
their actual identities right they're
gay men
who just have a parody thing where they
wear nuns outfits and white face and
stuff
and now they they were an institution in
San Francisco when I first moved there
so in 1979
the sisters are Perpetual indulgents
were already a thing and I recall that
in San Francisco they were very popular
you know just so you can have some
context the people in San Francisco just
enjoyed seeing them around yeah they
were fun they were funny
and they were they were never serious
and if so if somebody's funny and not
serious
I'm all about it yeah as long as you're
just having fun I'm all about it so I
used to I used to enjoy the sisters of
Perpetual Indulgence when I lived in the
city because their attitude was just
we're playing around we're we're going
to mock some people in power
you know uh I didn't care too much if
they were mocking religion it's not not
my big thing you know I I don't do it
myself but I didn't care if they did
so
but they're getting a little bit more
political so it's it's heating up
I love hate speech
all right uh let me see if I can
identify the uh the Democrats on on the
YouTube
all right let's say
Scott loves Hayes speech
is that uh do you think that's a
Republican or Democrat Scott loves hate
speech
take a guess
yeah obviously a Democrat because they
went after me instead of anything I say
all right
uh let's see if I can get some more
Democrats here
yeah obviously Democrat
but see if you can find that pattern the
pattern is that Democrats go after your
personality
and Republicans will do that too
but not until they've gone after your
policies
like they'll do that first
all right
uh but you're a Democrat yeah you don't
know I'm a registered Democrat just in
case anybody if you haven't heard it
when when I got canceled and the
Democrats said I was a racist
I didn't think it was fair to
you know
I didn't think it was fair to
Republicans
that I associate with them because the
Democrats said I was a racist so I I
register as a Democrat
so they could call me a racist
but I'm one of them I'm one of them now
so
take your pick
anyway none of that matters I mean you
could register us anything and vote for
whoever you want
running against Biden not new
I'm a sexist
everybody's a sexist
who is not a sexist
how in the world could you not be a
sexist oh you're not a sexist
because because the genders are the same
they're all the same
all right sure
yeah I mean I'm certainly in favor of
equal opportunity for everybody
but to imagine that the genders are the
same
it's kind of weird
all right that's all for now YouTube I'm
gonna say bye to you I'm going to talk
to the locals people for a minute I'll
see you in the morning YouTube thanks
