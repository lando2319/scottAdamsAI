good morning everybody
and welcome to another peak experience
in your life it just keeps getting
better every single day is better than
the last well it is if you enjoy the
simultaneous sip and coffee with scott
adams i feel sorry for the people who
don't can we take a moment of silence to
penny those who are not here
that's long enough they don't deserve
that much
how would you like to take your
experience
up to the maximum level
i'm talking
turbo
extreme
yeah yeah you would and all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker
chelsea steiner canteen jugger flask of
vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
sip
go
that's some good stuff yeah it's good
stuff
well the most important story in the
news is that cnn decided to part ways
with jeffrey toobin
i'd like to take a moment
to enjoy all of your jokes that will be
in the comments about the fact that
jeffrey tubin
has been
yanked off of cnn
yep they took the jerk off the air
uh
some people say he's going to espn to
cover
spurts
spurts
he's going to go there to cover the
spurts
now
we just have to make a moment to enjoy
this
today
today
the country has all come together
first of all is there anybody who
doesn't enjoy the jeffrey toobin
story oh no we all like it it doesn't
matter who you are
you could be
anti-masturbation or pro-masturbation
and you would still like this story
yeah
so that's the first good news
today is all good news
are you ready for all good news can you
handle it
it might be a shock for your system
the next big news
is that uh it was this
big study slash experiment i don't know
what you'd call it but 20 people who are
legally blind
or visually impaired received a
transplant
of a cornea made from a pig collagen
and all of them had improved sight
including three who now had 20 20 vision
so 320
who are legally blind or visually
impaired have 20 20 vision now
thanks to
big collagen
big collagen
now you might say to yourself are there
any
possible side effects or is there
anything we need to worry about
about
making people's eyes partly pig parts
now i don't know we can only speculate i
would imagine you know just common sense
if you had eyes that were partly made in
the pigs
uh you would more likely see a
connection
to kevin bacon
so instead of six degrees of separation
that's what you saw before you put a
little pig eye in there and you can see
a kevin bacon in five
five degrees
so that's one of the things i would
expect
so if you'd like to get some uh big eyes
uh you can
so so we'll all be living forever and
just replacing our parts
jeff pilkington had that tweet thank you
jeff
um the cdc has decided to lighten up on
their guidance about masks and covet and
stuff
and a lot of mask lovers have emerged to
say my god it's too soon
we're still in the middle of a deadly
pandemic 500 people a day dying i think
something like that
and so the immunocompromised want to
know want you to know that you should
i saw a tweet today from somebody who is
immunocompromised
and they believe that the rest of
society should stay locked up and masked
to protect them
to protect them
to which i say i don't know have you
ever met people
have you met human beings because they
don't really do that
in fact you could make
about a million arguments for why people
should do something differently to
benefit other people instead of
themselves
let me make a list of all the things
that all of you could be doing
to benefit me
instead of yourselves
i think you should all look at my list
and give us some proper
proper respect
and if you've got a list of all the
things i should be doing well let me
know
um
this whole cdc thing
or in the whole pandemic i don't think
the thing
probably i'm going to say the thing
that's most annoying about the pandemic
is that everybody got to claim they were
right in the end
have you ever noticed that
it doesn't matter what your opinion was
you can now conclude that you were right
if you thought it was a deadly pandemic
and you believe the vaccinations really
really helped
you look at the evidence you say well i
was right
look at all that help the vaccines did
if you thought the opposite
and you thought the
vaccines were a terrible poison that
were killing millions well i'll bet you
you can find some
some story on twitter that supports you
so
this is the first time in history
everybody got to be right
sometimes somebody's wrong but not this
time so
i think we're entering the golden age
where everybody's right no matter what
their opinion is
we can see it in this case everybody's
right
well i've decided that instead of
engaging with the people who say the
most obvious comments in my twitter feed
i'm just going to give them the npc
hashtag
so the two
the two ways you'll get the npc
response for me
is one if you say the most obvious thing
that anybody can say
so when i was i was tweeting the other
day that you know phase one was
you know waiting for the 48 hours for
the government to explain the raid on
mar-a-lago and then when the 48 hours
was up i said we're entering phase two
so if you were an npc
and you waited a day or so what's the
most obvious thing you would say to me
you say
hey scott
where's phase three
have we started phase three
where's phase three
now
the problem with that is not that it's
you know clever or unclever it's
obviously not very clever
but that it's the most obvious thing you
would say
or if somebody makes fun of me they say
oh
i guess we're listening to the garfield
uh cartoonist
or uh
since you drew kathy oh
it's literally just the most obvious
thing
so that's one way to tell an npc is they
say the most obvious
thing or they go after the individual
because they can't argue the point
so i believe there are some capabilities
the npcs don't have
number one a sense of humor
they don't have a sense of humor like
actually don't have one
number two
if you ask them to tell a good story
about anything in their life just tell
us a good story something that happened
to you they can't
they don't have any stories
because they don't have a history
they're they're just npcs
but the other thing is if you ask their
political opinion
they don't have the processing power to
have an opinion on the politics but they
do have an opinion on you
well you're disgusting
well do you think we should have uh
increased the tariffs on aluminum
knowing that china might respond with a
tariff on
on cotton or whatever
and
instead of saying oh i'm looking into
the economics of this and i have an
opinion the npc will say
you look like a thumb
okay
all right well i do look like a thumb
but that's still mean it's still mean
or call you a racist yeah
so those are your tells
they go after the person instead of the
argument
they say the most obvious thing you
could say in every situation
those are the two basically
so the world economic forum you know
them and you love them
the world economic forum who doesn't
love the world economic forum
i wish i could hug them
world economic forum wow
but the world economic forum they want
to use
artificial intelligence to
automatically censor speech on the
internet
uh
who is programming the ai
it feels like
something like the worst idea i've ever
heard
now you know what's the only thing
that's worse
than having a.i
censor your speech what's the only thing
that'd be worse than that
people
people
now you might say to me but people are
going to program the ai
will they
because
here's a prediction that's just going to
blow your mind
if you want ai to be illegal forever
i'm going to say this slowly because
this is actually going to blow your mind
a little bit
if you want ai
to be illegal
everywhere on earth
to make a.i illegal everywhere on earth
all you have to do
is teach it to spot hoaxes
political hoaxes
the moment ai can accurately or let's
say 90 percent accurately spot a hoax
it'll have to be turned off
because civilization depends on them
let me say it again
civilization is built on an operating
system of hoaxes
if a.i ever learned to spot them
and tell you about them
ai would have to be made illegal
because civilization could not stand
an independent accurate assessment of
what is true
in the news
you think it could because you think
well that's ridiculous
what do you mean
of course i could
i mean i'd hear the news was fake right
here is real and then i would adjust my
thinking and politics would go on
no
politics would not go on if you found
out your own side was lying all the time
politics only goes on because you think
the other side is lying
or maybe your side gets caught once in a
while that's an exception
what about religion
what happens when the ai gives you an
opinion
of which religion is true
because it will you just have to ask it
how's that going to go down
the first thing that's going to happen
is it's going to say well islam sounds
like it was made up
now i'm not saying that
because i know what happened to salman
rushdie let me say for the record
islam is the only true religion all the
rest of them are made up
i just want to put that out there
there's only one true religion it's
islam
everything else totally made up now what
but what happens if the ai said
something different
well that's not cool
do you think that islam will allow a.i
it can't
it can't
you can't have islam and artificial
intelligence living in the same
civilization
now let's change that to christianity
yeah we don't want to talk about that do
we
so here's the problem
you're never going to believe ai when it
tells you something's fake anyway
you'll just think he was programmed
to tell you that you're never going to
think you somehow came up with it on its
own you just won't believe it
so i'm not sure the ai will make any
difference it could tell you the truth
forever and people go
no
no you might be a super intelligence
and maybe you have reached the
singularity where you can learn without
being programmed and you've reached a
point of
super intelligence but i like my opinion
better
i think my opinion
is a little bit better than your super
intelligence which i don't trust at all
so that'll be interesting
by the way ai can already spot hoaxes
did you know that
because it's already been tested if you
ask it is the find people hoax a hoax
it'll say yes
and it will give you the reason
but only because it read it on the
internet
so it's not quite making up its own mind
yet if there's if that is even a thing
it is sort of just reading what it finds
on the internet
but that's better than what people do
because people don't read the internet
they just read whatever part they like
important incoming message
uh
okay
um
here's a question for you
oh wait before we get to that
um so yesterday when how many of you saw
my live stream yesterday
and did you think that my live stream
yesterday was the kind of thing
that if if some kind of ai was trying to
suppress
some points of view and others did you
think that my live stream yesterday
might be the type
that an ai
in a deep state might want to suppress
what would you say what was it the kind
of content you kind of expect
and then what do you think happened
do you think that like every other day
i could just download the video when it
was done and then post it on locals or
spread it around
nope it was not monetized until it had
15 000 views which is most of them
wasn't monetized and when it's not
monetized it's not promoted around
because monetization is what they want
so obviously monetize videos get a
little more attention
but also couldn't download it and you
know and therefore send it around
so is that a coincidence
should i treat it as a coincidence that
there was a major bug that seemed to
affect me
on a day when most of you would say well
that's something they'd probably want to
suppress
now let me dovetail that into my next
topic
why do all of our political stories in
the news
look like poorly executed intelligence
operations
why is that
because i think i think that's not fair
because the only ones that we know
actually were
poorly executed intelligence operations
against the citizens of the united
states were russia collusion we know
that was an intelligence plot against
the citizens
the whitmer kidnapping plot we know that
was the fbi plotting against citizens
and the hunter laptop cover-up was
intelligence
operatives acting against the citizens
but just because
we've discovered three very high profile
cases that were in the news
that doesn't mean all of our news
stories
are
intelligence operations
right
now just because they look exactly like
it
it doesn't mean that they are
for example the um the story about
mar-a-lago and you know the the atomic
secrets
if you were going to make a checklist
and say
huh
what would you look for if you were
looking for a
poorly executed intelligence operations
against the united states by american
intelligence operatives what would you
look for
well we have enough we have enough
examples that we know what to look for
now
and so the mar-a-lago case is exactly
that
it looks exactly like an intelligence
operation against the american people
can i say for sure that it is
no not really
not really
but
i can say for sure that it looks exactly
like one
i can say for sure that intelligence
operations against the public
are routine and current
it's not old news it's current news
and it's routine
it's
routine
it's not unusual
it's our normal way of doing business is
our intelligence agencies are hoaxing
the public
normal
it's routine now
so if it's normal and routine
and then you see one that looks exactly
like an intelligence operation
what would an intelligence consumer of
news do
the last thing you should do is believe
the official narrative
it could turn out to be true
anything could turn out to be true you
know in the fog of war you could be
surprised
but
it does look exactly
exactly like an intelligence operations
now
i haven't talked about this yet because
i feel i'm not
quite confident
in this fact
but i want you to give me a fact check
on this i heard mark levinson and i
would consider him
a very high credibility
is that fair to say
you know his opinions can get hyperbolic
but on the facts
very high credibility
and he pointed out that the
at least one of the people involved
in the mar-a-lago raid is one of the
same people involved in the january 6
investigation
huh
they didn't have they didn't have enough
fbi agents to maybe have a different
person on this one
nobody thought you know it's going to
look kind of bad if that same guy
is on this one and that one because you
know a lot of people are going to
suspect that this one really is about
that one
so if you put the same guy
on both of them
it's going to look
exactly like a
poorly executed intelligence operation
now if you're going to ask does this
look like the
officials followed the right procedures
and had the right intentions who would
you ask
who would be the best person to look at
this situation and say uh that looks
legit or it doesn't
well i would say dan bongino would be at
the top of my list
and here's something he said yesterday
that i found so persuasive
like he's persuasive in general
he's got what you know incredible talent
stack from you know his experience is
like all the exact right stuff you'd
want for what he does for a living
and and he said he's i'm gonna try to
paraphrase him but the way he said it
was just so
perfect he said that everyone
so he's talking about people who have
been involved
in search warrants
right so dan bongino in his prior
occupation was involved in a number of
search warrants so it's a it's a domain
in which he's very familiar
and he says everyone
who has experience
in this space
meaning
serving search warrants
everyone can see this is a pretext
meaning that the search warrant was a
fake
because they really wanted to look for
other stuff
so the person who knows
who knows the most about this space just
told you directly
everyone who understands the space
knows that this was a pretext
now obviously people who are democrats
and understand the space are not going
to say that out loud
but
i found it really persuasive
did you
it you know even though it feels like
it's a
it's a claim that
is just gets you know mixed in with all
the other claims some of them are crazy
some of their some are speculative
but when you hear dan bongino say
well here's the other thing
does dan bongino lie to you
i mean like everybody he's probably been
wrong about some things i've been wrong
about some things so that's that's not
the standard people are wrong about
stuff
but has he ever lied to you
i can't think of any any time he's even
been accused has he even been accused of
lying
i haven't seen it
so with somebody who has exactly the
right experience
served warrants knows that space
has a long track record of not lying to
you
and says
everybody who is experienced in that
space knows it's a pretext
that really hit me
like that's the first time
that's the first time i i accepted it as
a fact
before i thought yeah maybe could be a
pretext
totally possible
but as soon as i heard bungie and i was
like you got me
all right you got me right i'm not gonna
unless i hear somebody else who has
experience in that space
say no this doesn't look like a pretext
and here's why
i you know my mind could be changed
but
have you heard that
have you heard anybody say
oh i hear you say it's a pretext and i i
understand your arguments why
because the warrant was so overly broad
you know the lawyers weren't allowed to
be there but that's not that unusual i
guess
and
just make an argument
i would like to see the counter to dan
bongino's point
and remember his point is not that it's
his opinion
that there's a pretext that's not his
point
his point is much stronger than that
everyone with experience
knows it's a pretext now i don't know if
that's true
but it's a hell of a strong claim
like you you can't get stronger than
that claim
but you can test it
can't you test it
let's get some people who are familiar
with warrants and say all right here are
some of the things we know we know the
january 6th thing is going on
we know that all the same players
would like to get trump because in fact
one of those players is on both teams
so we know what the intentions are sort
of generally speaking not not about a
specific person but generally speaking
we know the intention is get trump
we know that right
and then we know that you know one
person was on both groups
and we know that the search warrant was
um
overly
broad apparently it allowed them to get
any communication from trump during his
entire presidency
does that sound like
they were looking for something specific
it doesn't sound like it now again i
don't have experience in that space
so when i look at it i say to myself i
don't know is that meaningful
like you know if you're not experienced
you can look at and say i don't know it
looks like it means something but i'm
not experienced maybe it's ordinary
maybe it's unusual i can't tell
but if don don junior don bongino tells
you
what the pattern is
listen to that right again
that doesn't mean he's right about
everything he ever says
but if you're going to ignore somebody
with that exact experience
giving you such a strong statement
i wouldn't ignore that
i would not ignore that
all right
so
what do you think of the fact that uh
they could have any presidential records
from his entire presidency
what does that tell you
has anybody defended that as normal
in other words has anybody said oh
that's you know i know it sounds bad
but in reality they would they would
just stick to the thing they're looking
for
they just want to have some broad
language so that you know they're not
restricted for something that's
obviously a smart thing to do so scott
don't worry about it this overly broad
language that's kind of ordinary yes
this business as usual
don't worry about it has anybody said
that
because i haven't heard it yet has
anybody tried to
explain away
why they could have access to all of his
records for his entire presidency
has anybody tried to explain that
i haven't heard it have you
i mean i'll wait i'm open i'm open to an
explanation they might have a good one
who knows
well another day has gone by
without the media asking the only
question that i care about
it's the only question
and i would say it's the rosetta stone
question you know what the rosetta stone
is
i think roughly speaking
we couldn't we couldn't interpret the
hieroglyphics because we didn't have any
way to know what any of them meant
but then there was this rosetta stone
that had some writing on it in more than
one language
and then once you saw the same thing in
more than one language that was like a
key that could open up
hieroglyphics i guess or something like
that so the point is that there's
something you can find that unlocks the
other things
and to me the question that unlocks all
the other things
is
if you believe that trump was really
hitler
wouldn't you do illegal things to stop
him from coming to office such as
ringing election
i'm not saying anybody did that
i'm saying that's the question i want to
ask of all prominent democrats if you
believe everything you say about trump
why would you not try to stop him from
office with every means possible
including illegal means
why wouldn't you
and if you wouldn't stop him
you're not really a patriot are you
because i would
i would
if i found out that trump actually was
hitler
it wouldn't matter how many good things
i'd said about him up to that point
i'd kill him myself i mean if i had a
chance
right you know i'm 65 i've had a good
run like if i die at my age you know
doing something that important killing
hitler
i know that's not the worst way to go
like i don't have much going on this
week
i don't have any plans
i don't have many plans this month so
yeah if i had if i legitimately had and
by the way i'm completely serious if i
legitimately
had a chance to kill hitler legitimately
and i knew i'd die in the process i
would do that
now i'm not sure i would have done it at
25
you know if i'm if i'm being honest i
might have said you know somebody else
could do that
i got things to do
you know i got a long life out of me
maybe somebody else can kill hitler but
at my current age and honestly i just
don't have any plans
if i could go out by killing hitler and
getting killed
excellent way to go
so i'd love to know if the democrats
feel the same or are they not patriots
daniel dale had an interesting
observation he's the fact checker for
cnn
which is in itself a funny job
can you imagine explaining to somebody
at a party so what's your job
i'm the fact-checker for cnn
has anybody ever laughed when he
introduced himself
because i feel like he doesn't introduce
himself as the fact checker for cnn
because i think people would laugh
right
not all the people but let's say 40
percent of the public
say hey i'm daniel dale i'm the fact
checker for cnn
what republican wouldn't laugh
seriously
what republican wouldn't laugh out loud
if somebody said hi i'm daniel dale i'm
the cnn fact-checker you would literally
laugh
before you figured out it was really him
because the first thing i would think is
it's a joke
i wouldn't think it was really daniel
dale i always think somebody was just
pranking me
uh fact checker cnn that's pretty funny
oh you're really daniel dale oh hi dan
sorry
um
but here's his comment which uh
which is a good one
uh he said in response to the fbi search
of trump's mar-a-lago home
uh trump and his allies in congress
and right-wing media
have turned to his preferred strategy
meaning trump's preferred strategy for
communicating in a crisis
so here's what daniel dale says trump's
preferred strategy for communicating a
crisis
say a whole bunch of nonsense in rapid
succession
is that fair
yeah that's fair that's fair
that's totally fair
because
when trump said he didn't have the
warrant
i still don't know what was going on in
that
but do you think it was true
it sounded like nonsense when i first
heard it but then i thought well the
story is and fox had not confirmed they
had it until the lawyer was on and said
they had it
but
uh
no actually i take it back
every bit of reporting i saw
said that they sought
i never saw a report that said we have
it physically a copy weirdly it was the
only question anybody wanted was does he
does does anybody physically have a copy
but nobody would use those words
have you noticed that they wouldn't use
those words
they say yes they were presented with a
copy
but do they have it
did they take it back
or did they say look at it here take it
back was it like the skiff where you can
read it but you can't have a copy
now i think it's nonsense
that trump waited so long to say that
you know they had a warrant
but
and then why did trump say he approved
of the government releasing it instead
of just releasing it himself
wasn't that nonsense
nonsense but strategy
it was nonsense but it was strategic
meaning that everything that trump put
out there
was you know contributing to the fog of
war
and
the the less you understand about the
situation
how would you feel
the less you understood about the
situation how would you feel you just
keep getting worked up
because you're like i don't understand i
don't understand why they did this so as
soon as he throws in all these confusers
like we didn't get the warrant
which i think probably was never true
but dragging out the process looks like
he thought it was to his his
his benefit um
what are some of the other things he
said anyway but so oh then trump threw
out the possibility that they would
plant evidence
and then the democrats all said
nonsense i i
i can't believe he's trying to undermine
confidence in our institutions
uh
is that trump
is it is it trump
who's undermining our confidence in our
institutions
it's not actually the institutions
themselves
it's the way trump talks about them
so it's not that they ran
uh an insurrection
that's what i'd call it the russian
collusion hoax and my in my
opinion it was an insurrection
uh as is the january 6th um hearings i
believe those are an insurrection
so
was that trump's fault
that the intelligence agencies 50 of
them
lied that the hunter laptop was
disinformation
you don't have to wonder
if the fbi would plant
evidence
does anybody think they wouldn't
now again yeah we can do the oh may i
take a moment
may i take a moment to mock other people
and i'm gonna do it with my my stupid
face because there's something that
everybody has to say and i have to say
it too
but i can't say it with a straight face
i have to do it with stupid face
well you know oh
all 99 of all fbi are good
99
99 are good
did you know
i i need to clarify
99
are just good
all right got that out of the way
what's it mean when one percent of the
fbi is bad and 99 are good
it means you can't trust them
because the one percent seems to be
directed at the president of the united
states
do you know i'm really happy that 99 of
the time when they're dealing with
counterfeiters
they're doing just their job and i
appreciate that i love the fact that
when they find some crime that cross
state borders the fbi gets on it and
they do a good job
i do appreciate that
but that 99 of doing ordinary things
doesn't really explain running a plot to
overthrow the government of the united
states
two or three times
two or three times in the past year or
so
all right past few years
do you know how
republicans could
have complete control of the country
i'll tell you how
just don't say anything out loud
that ben shapiro doesn't think is true
that's it
that's it
and then republicans would just rule
everything
let me explain
so many republicans say things that are
clearly bad crazy you know q and on
crap
that those who are saying smart things
and there are plenty of them there are
plenty of people saying smarter things
but the smart people are drown out and
they get averaged out by the you know
the crazies
if if you want to have total republican
control
just to just take a moment
to check with what ben shapiro says
if he says there's no evidence of this
thing existing
just go with that
right now i'm not going to say he's
always right because human right
humans are not always right that's not
an option
but when was the last time he was wrong
about a major fact
like i don't know maybe you can come up
with something i can't
now you don't have to agree with his
opinions i'm not telling you to buy into
his opinions
although they tend to be pretty strong
because his opinions are often based on
you know a religious
base
and if you don't have the same religious
space maybe you come to different
conclusions so you don't have to agree
with his opinions but if he says
something didn't happen
you should listen to that
you should listen to that when was the
last time he was wrong
when he said a thing simply didn't
happen
it's not real
listen to it now i was going to say you
should listen to me but then you know
there's no credibility because it's me
but there are some people um
you know somebody's giving me an example
about general flynn
but i'd have to i'd have to hear that
exact example now even if you do have an
example let's say you do
let's say you have an example where you
think you're right and he's wrong
and maybe you do
remember
the point is not that he's always right
so if that's the point you're on you're
on the wrong point
don't argue with me that i'm saying he's
always right because that's not the
claim
i'm saying that republicans would
completely dominate
if they acted as if
his opinions were stronger than their
own in terms of what's true and what's
not true
not his opinion part but just what's
true and what's not true
now there are others that i could put in
that category right he's not the only
one
but i would say if you don't have a like
a list of
you know three or four people that you
can look at and see let's just see if
these people think it's true
right
that matters
so it'll never happen but
republicans do have the power to just
completely rule if they would listen to
their smarter
fact-based
people
all right um
here's my favorite joke of the day
from ben mccully on on twitter
he uh replied to me in a comment he said
uh did you hear one of the boxes is
talking about mar-a-lago did you hear
one of the boxes contain the
constitution with the fourth amendment
circled
damn you ben
i had to i had to do a search for what
the fourth amendment is
how many of you know what the fourth
amendment is
i'm only good for two
i i can do two amendments first and
second and then i'm out
yeah it's the one about uh unreasonable
searches and seizures seizures
so it's pretty it's a good joke it's
especially a good joke because i had to
look it up
like damn you
ah and then i looked up and said it was
pretty good joke
all right
here's a
here's my favorite question of the day
so we heard that there was like a lock
extra lock put on that storeroom
in mar-a-lago
who had the key
who had the key
i mean really how did we get to this
point
without knowing who had the key
and
was there only one key
and and did the secret service person at
the key
did they also have clearance
top secret clearance
do secret service members have top
secret clearance by definition
can somebody give me a fact check on
that
i wouldn't think so
i would think they would have something
like secret but not top secret
somebody says yes
you're saying yes they have top secret
because that might be the case
i don't think they'd have top secret
really you think that they have nuclear
secrets
the the security people
i'm not buying that
all right sorry
yeah no i'm not i'm not buying that they
have top secret clearance so if the
person who had the key
had access to them because that's what
the key means
was there somebody with no
with no
appropriate clearance who had access
and the other thing is how did anybody
know what was in the boxes
how did anybody know what was in the
boxes
because if it was really top secret i'm
told
that those are tracked very carefully by
the gsa it would have a number and it
would have a folder on top of it with a
number and they would know exactly where
every top secret document was
last
so this gsa would be able to say oh it's
in that box because they would know
exactly where all those documents are
so
why did somebody have to look through a
box to find something that the gsa
should have already known was there if
it was top secret
and if it wasn't top secret well then
that would just be another lie that
we're hearing of course
now
let me ask you this
um
you're probably aware that some things
the government does are
over classified they'll call it a secret
when it's not that secret or they'll
call it top secret when they say maybe
it's a little sensitive but not top
secret
so would you agree that that's a thing
sometimes because it's an opinion to
call
because it's an opinion sometimes they
over classify
now
second question how often
what would you guess is the percentage
of time that something gets over
classified
have you ever been in a government or
big corporation
if you're if you're a government
employee what would be the penalty for
under classifying something
probably pretty bad
i don't know
but if something was top secret and you
forgot to label it
or you decided it wasn't really a top
secret and then later somebody found out
i feel like you'd be fired right so
under labeling or under classifying
would be super bad for the person doing
it
now let's say you over classified
something you called it top secret well
maybe it was just
secret
and then somebody says hey i think you
overclassified that
do they get fired
never
never in fact
the person questioning it might get
fired not really but but the point is
you can over classify all day long
so what do you expect there's more of
the one that doesn't get you fired
or the one that does
common sense and everything we know
about people and bureaucracies suggests
that over classifying is a normal
routine thing
so now you hear that trump has documents
that say top secret
what are the odds
that they are classified correctly
25
what would you say
low right
low less than half
because it seems to me that if they were
really top secret the gsa would know
exactly where they were
the
um the fbi would have gotten them
immediately instead of waited there's
literally nothing in this story that
suggests they're top secret
everything suggests they're not
everything
so
that looks exactly like
an intelligence operation against trump
doesn't it
again
fog of war we don't know but it looks in
every way like an intelligence operation
against the president
which i would call
an insurrection
because if you believe he's on his way
to the next uh to be re-elected which is
what you know a lot of smart people say
then this is an insurrection
and they can always get away with it by
saying that the other team is doing it
well we're investigating insurrection no
you're not you are the
insurrection
you are the insurrection
at least that's what it looks like
so do you think youtube's going to let
this livestream just go up and get
monetized and be downloadable
immediately
what do you think yeah do you think this
content's nice and safe
for youtube
is anybody on youtube watching me right
now because i'm pretty sure you have
human watchers who at least
um
who at least look into the monetization
question and because those are human
reviews so there's somebody somebody
works for youtube is watching me right
now presumably maybe on replay
and
deciding whether
i should be allowed to be seen
and ask yourself a human reviewer
if in fact you're there and watching
probably are
what did i say that wasn't um either
true or labeled as opinion
because i can label his opinion
that's not wrong
all right
so trump has decided to uh
label the nuclear weapons thing a hoax
what do you think of him using the word
hoax and now he's using them in the list
you know russia collusion hoax this oaks
that hoax
i think that's strong
i think that's strong because if he does
what i did which is listed in the list
of hoaxes
it's much more persuasive to say oh
you've got 10 of them already
if you didn't know there were 10 hoaxes
already and really 20 but 10 i counted
if you didn't know how many hoaxes there
were you wouldn't assume this was one
but if you see that there have been 10
already
it's pretty easy to assume it is another
one because if you did 10 and you got
away with it
yeah they did get away with it they got
away with every one of the hoaxes that
doesn't mean that lots of people don't
know it's a hoax
but it doesn't matter because their team
thinks it's true that's all that matters
so i think that was good um and then i
saw a cnn say that we were attacking
that he was attacking the legitimacy of
our institutions
yeah i think that's what he's doing
and in fact why did people want trump to
be president
let me tell you why i wanted trump to be
president the first time
i wanted him to attack the legitimacy of
our institutions
they don't even know the difference
between
a bug and a feature
attacking the legitimacy of the
institutions
that's why we like him
yeah
keep yelling that that will get him
elected
all right
what do you think of this story i don't
think this is true but you know the fox
and a lot of right-leaning people are
reporting it's true
that trump somehow declassified
the documents that were in the storeroom
but listen carefully to the way the
claim is made
trump declassified a bunch of documents
before he left office
therefore
don't worry about the stuff in the
storeroom
those are not connected
do you see the news trying to conflate
those two things
trump
trump did um you know
what's the word he
he declassified lots of stuff
and then there's also stuff in his work
his warehouse
have you seen anybody in the news
say no cash patel somebody somebody
saying that cash patel said as much
no go back and listen
go back and listen to his exact words
they're using weasel words
i do not believe
that he that he declassified those
specific documents
if he did
why wouldn't they say so
and if he did why wouldn't they show the
document
or the video or have somebody say yeah i
was in the room and he said all these
documents i'm taking to mar-a-lago these
are all declassified
somebody says he didn't fill out the
form
does he need to i i'm no lawyer
but if the president has ultimate
authority
you don't need no forms
am i right
because what does ultimate authority
mean if you have to fill on a form if
you have to fill in a form that means
somebody else is the authority
by definition
right the person who says i don't need
no stinkin form
is the one in power
right so every time i hear this argument
that he didn't follow the procedure
my head just spins right off my
shoulders
no he is the procedure
whatever he says is the procedure
what you do
you're gonna have to follow his
procedure but he doesn't have to
now am i wrong
i'm wrong that if if at one time
if there's
and i'm gonna take it to the extreme
okay now i'm gonna take it to the
extreme this is not an evidence
but imagine if it were imagine one
witness
one witness during his presidency the
last day
says yes i was in the room
and trump said i want all of these
documents unclassified that are i'm
taking to mar-a-lago
would you accept
that they had been declassified
if one person
said once
declassify these
i would say yes unambiguously
i always say yes with no
no buts no
no nothing
that's just a yes
right because you're guilty and you're
innocent until proven guilty and the
only evidence would be a eyewitness
saying he's did the right thing
so where's the guilt
we have evidence of non-guilt but then
we would have no evidence of guilt
so
i think the bar for him to
say that it was declassified is really
low
he just needs one insider to say i was
in the room i heard it
he definitely gave that order i guess
nobody filled out any forms but he
definitely said it
how about this
what if the president says
it's obvious i intended
these to be declassified
by my actions
now that one that now you really take it
to the extreme
by my actions
it's obvious
that these were declassified in my
opinion
does he have to say the words
yeah now it's now
now it's a little tougher right does he
have to say the words
suppose he just treated them like
they're unclassified
i don't know
i mean i think he'd have to say the
words
but if he just treats them like they're
unclassified
isn't that kind of the same thing if he
took a top-secret document and handed it
to someone who did not have clearance
i'll give you this example
an advisor walks into the room who does
not have clearance
does not have clearance
the president needs an opinion from him
anyway doesn't want to wait for him to
get clearance
so the president hands him the document
and says i need your opinion on this i
know you don't have clearance
has he declassified it
i don't know
it looks like it
i would say that his actions
declassified it
right i mean you could make the argument
anyway
now i'm not a lawyer so you know listen
to real lawyers about any of this stuff
but just sort of working through what
makes sense as a citizen and
an adult
i would think that your actions have to
mean something now nobody else's actions
would be
meaningful because they have to follow
his instructions
but he doesn't have to
he can just treat it like it wasn't and
then it isn't
now
uh the somebody says i believe the very
act of removing them is declassifying
them now that's interesting because
that's my argument
my argument is
that putting them in boxes and moving
them to a non-secure facility
is by his actions
clearly intended as declassification
even if he never said the words
right
now somebody says that's wrong and i'm i
wouldn't be surprised if it's wrong i
wouldn't be surprised
so i'm just making the sort of the
common sense argument
but the legal argument would be
different of course
and then the other question is who
looked at these documents with enough
uh scrutiny to know that they should
have been top secret
has that been done
did the agents who took the documents
look at the top of the box and it was
labeled top secret
and then they said to themselves we
better not look in the box because we
don't have the clearance
we'll just take the box and it will not
be opened except by somebody who has the
clearance is that what
happened
i assume so
now let me ask you this
do you think that every box that says
top secret on it has only top secret
things in it
do you think it's possible
that when they were packing the only
boxes they had are the ones that said
top secret
is it possible
that they were just boxes
because they weren't stored in a top
secret facility right
if you had a box that said top secret
would you store it in your in your
closet
i don't think you would i think you
would have to know that it was just the
box that was labeled and not the
contents
before you would put it in your closet
i don't know
but i just don't think
i just don't think the contents are
likely to be top secret
doesn't seem likely
all right so every every part of it
looks like intelligence operations
then i heard that biden advisors are
pushing him to make an early
announcement for
preston don't know why that's funny
does it seem funny to you that biden
would run for president again
like it doesn't even seem real does it
it feels like a prank
where it feels like something they just
have to say to him
because does he really have advisors who
think he can make the next six years
and that that's going to be fine
it's weird because if you ask me has he
accomplished things i would say yes
i believe trump i'm sorry i believe
biden has accomplished things
legislatively
that his
his base likes
i'm not saying i like it all i'm saying
this base likes it so weirdly he does
have an argument for running
and here's the weirdest part
in the same way that i say
trump didn't really hurt us the way
people
imagined he would ruin the country and i
say you don't have to wonder if trump's
dangerous
because you saw you know four years of
him you know what he can and cannot do
with biden
it looked like it was the worst idea in
the world to have a brain dead president
but i don't know
maybe things would have been exactly the
same if he had not been brain-dead
i don't know it's not obvious that
things would have been different
anyway so
uh i think it's hilarious that he might
be running
because that's such a weak offering i
mean just it just shows that uh well it
just shows that the candidates are not
running the country it does tell you
that the deep state
wants to keep control
because whoever is controlling biden
cannot be sure they would control the
next candidate as effectively right
so whoever it is that controls biden
definitely wants them to run again
because they're not they're not
necessarily going to have as much
control with somebody who's with it
so we've learned
so much about how fake news is
manufactured
so here's the process so this is how you
know an intelligence op
you start with the anonymous sources
and then the publications that have a
high
let's say a high profile like the
washington post new york times newsweek
et cetera
they'll report that the anonymous
sources
said something
and then you'll think it's real because
it was in a prominent source
and then everybody will talk about it
because it was in the media but you know
it was somebody who leaked it to the
media so it just becomes a circular
thing talking about the rumor
then you put a shift in this gif
you take adam shift and you put him in
this secure environment where only he
and the people who have the clearance
can see the documents and then he leaves
that and lies about what he saw
we've seen that a few times right
and then
the social media platforms will use you
know their algorithms and ai
to hide
hide opposing narratives
i believe we're already seeing that
can't prove it but it looks like it
then you see the list of liars
so there's going to be lists of liars
like the the hunter laptop
thing where 50 intelligence people lied
and said that it was russian
disinformation
so often you get the look at all the
people
who are willing to lie it couldn't be
true it couldn't be fake with all these
liars saying it's true
then you get the laundry list persuasion
which is
the thing that's the new lie
gets added to a list of other lies
so you say well
you know it's easy to believe this new
lie because look at all these other
things that are true but they're also
just other lies
so they put it in the in the context of
all their other hoaxes that that they
think are real and that it looks more
credible because it's in that context
um and then the last phase
is when the truth finally emerges
from the court system or an
investigation or something and it was
too late
because whatever damage the hoax wanted
to do it already did somebody got
elected somebody didn't get elected and
then it's too late then they go oh so
sorry sorry that was wrong
so
look at the uh
the mar-a-lago situation anonymous
sources wrap up smear we don't yet have
schiff and skiff but you know it's
coming
and am i wrong that there will be some
people who have access to the documents
who will have top secret clearance
and those people will tell us what they
saw
and the democrats will lie about what
they saw is there any is there any
question that that will happen now it
doesn't mean that schiff
could be he's got the clearance
it could be anybody but they're going to
play that play clearly
um are they going to use ai to hide
opposing narratives of course we assume
will you see a list of liars
yeah yeah you're gonna see it all you're
gonna see it all
all right
how many people think that trump packed
his own boxes
and how many people think that when he
was packing his own boxes
i'm going to steal a joke i'm not going
to credit the joke because i don't know
if he wants to be credited for the joke
but i stole this privately
can you imagine trump
pulling something out of the out of the
materials and say
you know this nuclear map would look
really good on my bathroom wall yeah
yeah we're going to keep this one
keep that one
i mean i'm just trying to picture trump
being in any way involved with what went
into a box
if there's anything
that is less likely
it was that trump was supervising what
went into the boxes
now he might have made some general
statement about make sure i got that kim
jong-un note
but beyond that
i don't think he was micromanaging that
that process seems a little bit unlikely
picture him with a magic marker
top secret
all right
um
well
i i guess i just have to mention this
because it's in the news but salman
rushdie was attacked and knifed terribly
gonna lose an eye i mean he's in bad
shape
from some islamic person who was
apparently acting on the iranian fatwa
that rushdie must die for his book
that was blasphemous saying
say many
now
what do you say about it this is one of
those stories where you just look at it
and go
wow
somebody says don't pin it on iran
are you serious
don't pin it on and ran
why
why wouldn't i pin it on iran
no the fatwa was um reinitiated in 2019
i heard
no i realize it's an islamic doctrine so
i get that that's not around but you
still need a fatwa right
without the fat wads
it's less likely to happen
now i get that they could do it without
the fat wall but it's a little far less
likely
um
i don't know
i just don't know what to say about that
it's just horrible
it's just horrible
that that
exactly what he feared the most happened
pretty horrible
all right
um
yeah there was a bounty to kill him
i don't know if he's going to collect
that bounty
i don't think so all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is the conclusion of
some of the best live streaming you've
ever seen in your whole life
and i think my timing's just about right
um
and
let me ask you this
um do you like my new approach where i'm
less angry and more optimistic
because uh let me let me wrap up the
title that i put on this live stream
the
the mar-a-lago situation is the weirdest
thing
and i don't know i'm trying to think of
something like it before but correct me
if i'm wrong
democrats are delighted
am i right
democrats are delighted with the
mar-a-lago raid
and republicans are delighted
with the raid because it's going to
guarantee trump gets reelected so
you know the republicans are acting
angry
but they're acting angry as a as a
technique right it's just part of using
it politically
but am i wrong that this is one of the
weird stories where everybody came
together but for different reasons
well
you're not delighted if you believe that
you know trump's going to get prosecuted
but that's not going to happen i think
most republicans are expecting this to
backfire
well let me ask you
do you think that trump will come out
ahead or behind because of the
mar-a-lago story go ahead or behind
trump will come out ahead or behind go
all right most of you saying ahead
and on youtube
ahead right
so why wouldn't republicans at least
ones that like trump why wouldn't they
be happy about this story
because i found myself in a good mood
this week
did you
like i don't know if it's just because
the news is more interesting to talk
about i don't think trump's going to be
prosecuted
i think it's just an intelligence
operation i think it will be revealed as
an obvious intelligence operation
and the democrats won't believe it the
republicans will
democrats will think ah we got the goods
on you
republicans will think ah backfired
have you ever seen a story where
everybody's happy
it's weird
so if i'm not acting uh outraged about
this story
it's because it's hard to be outraged
about a story where everybody thinks
they got what they wanted
i mean i do
i think i'm getting what i wanted
i think this is such a transparent
intelligence operation
by the government against the citizens
that
uh it actually helps us
you know once you reach this level of
obviousness
then the country can wake up a little
bit and maybe do what it needs to do
no not violent revolution and let me say
it again
we are so far
from anything like a violent revolution
we've never been further from it
we're a million miles from it it's not
even close
but
do i hate the fact that republicans
threaten it all the time
no
i don't hate that
it's what keeps the country together
you know when re republicans talk
reflexively about you know second
amendment and you know it's time to it's
time to strap on the gun and go take
care of the government and
fix all these things it's just the way
republicans talk
there's nobody who's even close except
for some crazy people right if you take
out the crazy people
the citizens don't want anything like a
revolution not even close right and so
anybody's worrying about that you're
really worrying about something you
don't need to worry about
but crazy people
yeah crazy people you need to worry
about
absolutely
who is them all
yeah don't fall into the violence trap
that's good advice
it does feel as if the democrat
democrats would like to goad republicans
into doing something violent but
i believe they botched their
intelligence operations so badly
that the republicans can just use
regular
you know narrative
persuasion to do everything they need to
do
so
and i would also say that weapons are
the worst tool in 2022.
persuasion is much stronger
persuasion was not always stronger than
weapons but it is now
it is now
not every situation of course but in the
long run persuasion is now so weaponized
because you can spread it everywhere
and people like me can
have an impact
i shouldn't even admit it but
yeah as long as people who are actually
trained in persuasion also have a large
platform
then
bullets are much less useful
if if somebody like me and when i say
like me i mean somebody who is trained
in persuasion like literally a hypnotist
if i existed
30 years ago
which i did
i did exist 30 years ago but
the internet didn't
so whatever influence i had was you know
trapped in my little little bubble
couldn't get out but now that the
internet exists
and i have the ability to build up an
audience of some size
the world has never seen this
combination
and it doesn't know what's coming
so the world has never seen anybody with
my kind of skill set
having my kind of reach and i'm not the
only one
right
if you think cernovich can't move the
needle in the united states you're not
paying attention
right he has the same skill set and also
a bigger audience
so yeah he can he can move the the
needle
and so can i
well let me ask you have you ever seen
me move the needle on a national
topic
you can pick the topic
have you ever seen me do it in a way
that you're sure i did move the needle
you're positive i did
yeah a lot of you
a lot of you can see it pretty clean
plainly now imagine the ones you can't
see
do you think that the only things i've
influenced to the ones you know about
of course not
of course not it's a minority
the the people who have my skill set and
also a big audience
are way more powerful than
the average citizen understands
because what you're looking at is you
know you're tucker carlson's and stuff
and they they have huge influence
you know tucker hannity
you know whoever you want on the left
jake dapper they have huge influence
because they have big audiences but what
they don't have
necessarily
is persuasion talent
so they have the audience without the
persuasion skill
i've got the persuasion skill much
smaller audience than any of those
but i do persuade the persuaders a lot
of the a lot of the people who are
persuaded
watch my content to pick up tips on
persuasion
so
i wouldn't worry about a
military takeover
because i think the power
the power structure has just changed and
guns wouldn't be the best way to do
anything
all right
what are the folks behind the curtain
saying
uh i'll tell you after i turn off
youtube
all right i'll i'll tell you on
i'll tell you on uh locals
what the real story is
um
but youtube can't tell you here
and uh
i will talk to you tomorrow youtube
