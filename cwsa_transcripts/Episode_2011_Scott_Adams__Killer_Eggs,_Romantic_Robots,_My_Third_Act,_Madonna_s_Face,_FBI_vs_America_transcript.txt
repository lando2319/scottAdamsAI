good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
there's never been a better time
if you'd like to upgrade your situation
all you need to make this moment one of
the greatest moments of your entire life
all you need is a copper mugger glass
attacker Chelsea sign the canteen Joker
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
now for you members of YouTube and
anybody on the locals platform who is
just joining us
if you had been
a local subscriber this morning
and if you had been early
on to the live stream
you would have had the pleasure of
watching me
destroy my printer
on my hard floor
there's not much left but I think you'd
like to well I won't show you what's
left but there's I'm sort of sitting
within a debris field here
I'm trying to figure out because I'm not
wearing shoes
I'm trying to figure out
how to how to get out of the the debris
field when the live stream is over
I think I'm gonna have to climb over my
desk to go get some shoes to go clean up
the debris now a lot of you are saying
to yourself Scott do you have some kind
of like
terrible uh I don't know some kind of
anger problem
not anymore
I did have an anger problem
about 10 minutes ago I had an elephant
anger problem
now I just have a broken printer problem
but anger totally gone
totally gone now a lot of people waste
time going to anger management programs
no just destroy the thing that's
bothering you not not humans
not humans
not dogs not animals but if it's an
inanimate object
at some point the correct answer is to
destroy it on your hard floor
I don't make the rules that's just the
only thing you can do that works
so today I'll be working from my notes
on my phone which will be nearly as
dynamic
but it's the best we can do for today
I'll see if I can get myself into a
printer
uh the biggest story of the day is uh
what the hell is wrong with Madonna
what the hell's wrong with Madonna
um what was what was the awards program
that was on last night was that the
Grammys
was it the Grammys
all right am I the first one to make
this joke
if I'm the first one to make this joke
there's something wrong with the world
and it goes like this
wind up wind up wind up
it's called the Grammys
why else would Madonna be there
it's called the Grammys
all the grandmothers are there
now
did nobody else make that connection
I can't be the first
I can't be the first
yes it's the grannies from the Grammys
to the grandmas Awards
some people said that the entire thing
was satanic
did I miss something
there was I saw on social media today
people saying that uh artist Sam Smith
did some kind of satanic presentation
and then I saw their outfits and the
outfits did look like uh they came from
the basement of uh
uh some pizza parlor if you know what I
mean
and here's the thing that I uh and then
also one of the big
Applause scenes was apparently there was
a the first
trans woman winner
I saw it only on a clip that's what
happened right it wasn't the first trans
woman who won a Grammy
and and there was lots of clapping and
people were quite happy about that and
I'm gonna I've got another story that's
gonna tie into that pretty well
um but here's my take
uh to me it looks like Madonna's on
drugs what do you think
is that what's going on
because it doesn't look like insanity
doesn't look like any kind of dementia
and it doesn't look like somebody who's
not on drugs
so I think I think the people who are
making fun of her physical appearance
are sort of missing the plot
the physical appearance is really
an outcome
of whatever else is going on and I feel
just
what I see is someone who can't be
helped
because she's a free person and she's
Madonna so nobody's going to embarrass
her right she's it's impossible to
embarrass her nobody's going to shame
her nobody's going to pressure her
because she's Madonna
but somebody needs to this is one of
those this is one of those situations
where it looks like you know we can't
read minds so we're speculating quite a
bit here but it looks like she needs
some help
but she's in this
extraordinarily unique situation where
she can't be helped because she's
Madonna
I and I feel like that's the Fatal flaw
of a lot of the celebrities who end up
dead from overdoses and whatnot that
nobody can help them
at some point they're just unhelpable
and you one of the reasons that I'm
tuned into this
is that I'm the uh let's say I'm the
poor man's version of this
who the hell is going to tell me what I
should do when I'm 90 and I'm out of my
freaking mind
who
that's right Erica Erica will tell me
but will I believe Erica because I'll be
out of my mind right so it doesn't
matter how well-meaning or smart or
helpful somebody is
if you're not going to listen to them
what are the odds that I'm going to
listen to Somebody's advice when I'm 90.
yeah assuming I you know still have
assets and I can still live
independently I'm not going to take
anybody's advice I don't think
and you know I think I would at the
moment
so at the moment I still have enough of
my faculties that I know oh that sounds
like good advice then I'll incorporate
that but I don't think I'll be able to
do that forever
so what the hell is going to happen to
people like me I'm going to have too
much power
relative to my sanity
you know if I live long enough
so it is something I I literally uh
wonder how that's going to work out all
right the other important issue of the
day there's nothing but important issues
today
these are the big ones
eggs
eggs are they the healthiest food you
can eat a great source of protein or are
they serial killers
and if you want to spell cereal c-e-r
that would be sufficient pun for this
morning
that would be okay
I'm not going to do that but you can
and so I did a Google search because
whatever Google
decides to highlight
feels like that's the official
what the government wants you to know
doesn't it feel like that
because we've seen how much the FBI can
and you know in Congress can influence
all the social medias so if so if Google
summarizes one of the answers and you
know how Google summarizes some answers
if it's something that people ask a lot
they'll put a little category with their
own official summary of the answer
well Google's official summary of the
answer of whether eggs are dangerous for
your health
is that the eggs are half an egg a day
is associated with more deaths from
heart disease cancer and all causes
all causes
all causes
if you eat half an egg a day your odds
of falling off a ladder apparently go
through the roof
if you eat a half an egg a day the odds
of being a victim of a drive-by shooting
way up all causes
it does say all causes your odds of
dying on a trip to Mars
well probably up as much as 24 that's
just a guess but it's way up
so that's what Google says and you can
certainly believe Google because they're
going to use science and stuff so half
an egg a day they'll probably a little
it'll freaking kill you
or or
as ivora Cummins sent beat as in
response to this tweet
the story of uh 88 year old man who ate
25 eggs a day for many many years and
they studied him and he had normal
cholesterol
he had normal cholesterol ate 25 eggs a
day now I don't want to tell you
they're studying one 88 year old man who
eats 25 eggs a day is science
it's not exactly science there could be
individual differences and you know
maybe some people are just natural egg
eaters or something
but
are you Blown Away by the fact that we
don't know if eggs are good for you or
bad for you
everything is just covered shots
once you have that frame in your head of
the pandemic and all the coveted
Band-Aids and stuff and the vaccines
even the egg looks like a covenant
vaccination to me like my head just
can't get out of that model I'm stuck in
that model so
I don't believe anything about eggs
I don't know that they're good or bad I
have no way to know do you
so what do you do do you eat eggs and
make yourself healthier or to eat eggs
and have a 24 greater chance of dying or
whatever it is
how do you make that decision
well I have a
I have a suggested possibility but we'll
get to that
um here's what I think I think almost
nobody eats an egg by itself
am I right
the only person I know who eats an egg
by itself is this 88 year old guy who
eats 25 of them a day because I think
it's probably all he eats
but don't you eat it with toast
right I I feel like the people who eat
an egg a day are eating other stuff that
has cholesterol in it so it might be a
little hard to
you know tease out just the egg part
you wonder if they did that right
anyway I have nothing to say about eggs
except we don't know the most important
story of the day is that there's a
company that's trying to roll out a
chain of sex robot brothels
that bear is repeating
sex robot brothels
now if you think well that'll never work
it already did
the reason that they want to do a chain
of them is that the first one must have
been a big hit
if you're surprised by that
if you're surprised by that you don't
really understand men
let me just say that if there are any
women who don't understand
why some number of men are you know
happily going to sex robots you really
don't understand men
because it's very very understandable
if you take a heterosexual man and put
him in prison
how fast does he become flexible
really fast
when that person gets out of prison
are they heterosexual again yeah usually
immediately yeah right back to
heterosexual
so it turns out that men are very
flexible when they have that one need
that needs to get met
and uh so they're trying to put one in
Houston which I think is the funniest
thing
of all the places you would put your
your sex robot brothel
I think Houston is the funniest now now
what what I love about this story is
when people have to think too much
that always gets funny
and one of the things that people have
to think about is that our laws do not
make it well in most cases I think most
States it's legal
for a human to get busy with a let's say
a sex toy that just happens to look like
a person and act like a person a little
bit
foreign
so I think this is going to be a big hit
if it's legal but why let me ask you do
you think you should be illegal
for a human to have sex with a robot
how many think that should be illegal
mostly Say No it should not be
what happens if it eliminates uh
reproductive processes
would you change your mind
see I think we're going to get pushed
into a situation where our reproduction
rate is so low
that some politician is going to say huh
maybe part of the reason the
reproduction rate is too low is because
of the Alternatives these sex robots are
too good we're gonna have to get rid of
the sex robots so that people want to
reproduce
that's going to happen
that's definitely going to happen
all right but here's my prediction
I was reading even today the article
that was about the sex robot brothels
you would not be surprised to hear that
the journalist and I won't even name him
the journalist
seem to be sneering
in his attitude
about the people who would be
robo-sexuals
can we call them robo-sexuals
people who like robots as their sexual
preference robosexuals I'm gonna I'm
gonna coin the term if nobody's already
done it robo-sexuals
so here's my prediction
robosexuals are now the the one sexual
preference category that you can well I
think maybe the furious people still
make fun of but there are some groups
you can still make fun of
and so articles about the sex robot
brothels definitely you're gonna throw
some shade on the customers don't you
think
don't you think the customers are going
to get a little shade every time they
talk about it yes they will and do you
think there will be a point where those
customers organize
and insist that they add the r for
robosexual to the LBGTQ Plus blockchain
because now the the whole lgbtq Things
become like a blockchain
where you you never destroy the history
so it'll always be at least lgbtq but
now we're adding letters to it as we
find more more discriminated classes and
I think the robosexuals are going to
have to add an R
so someday
God willing
the Grammys
will not just be about you grandmother
but will also be a robosexual winning an
award and people will cheer
and they'll say you are so brave you're
so brave to have sex with robots
and and be out of the
out of the closet
would that be the right term
yeah
um so that's coming
um the GOP
arently have decided that in their gun
control debate that they're having right
now that many of them are wearing an
AR-15 pin instead of the American flag
pin which they often wear the
Republicans
now what do you think of that
is that a good play because the AR-15
looks like the gun itself
it's a little pin they have in the lapel
so a number of them are wearing it I
don't know what percentage you're
wearing it good idea or a bad idea
all right here's how you analyze it from
a persuasion perspective
you ask yourself what's the upside you
ask yourself what's the downside
how many extra votes will the
Republicans get because they wore a gun
on their lapel
extra votes zero right right and we we
could be pretty confident of that
you know no matter how low your opinion
of people in Congress I believe because
I have faith in them
though almost nobody has ever based a
vote on somebody's lapel pin
so would you agree there's no upside
would you agree no upside
let's talk about the downside it created
a whole news cycle which makes
Republicans look like the real issue is
love of guns
as opposed to the love of the
Constitution and America
the flagpin says I like everything
America stands for and that includes the
Second Amendment prominently
right the American flag is the exact
logo
for the Second Amendment
it's not even off by like one percent
it's right on target it's the exact
message it's America we do this
as soon as you make it about the gun you
lost the argument
you you come to me and say I I want guns
to be legal because I love my gun so
much I'm wearing it as clothing
I will say nope nope you you brought me
no argument
my argument wins but if you bring me the
American flag you high grounded me right
that's The High Ground you can't get
higher than you know nationalism within
the country
okay so here's my prediction
which can be I guess falsified
um I don't know the answer to this and
you might already
so I promise you I don't already know
the answer it might be a public record
but I haven't seen it I promise you I
don't know the answer
I predict
that Matt Gates will not wear that lapel
pin
and the prediction is based on the fact
that he's he's playing at a higher level
of understanding of persuasion
yeah I cannot wrap my head around the
possibility
that Matt Gates would be dumb enough to
wear the lapel pen instead of the
American flag pin which is obviously the
right answer
now somebody go check that because
probably we'll know
you know we'll we'll get the news will
probably cover who wore and who didn't
but my prediction is he's operating at a
higher level and would not fall for that
ridiculous
bad imagery
let's see
so now you have something you can test
and call me wrong about
uh let's talk about uh Jonathan Turley
um who you should be following
uh he's talking about how the house
select committee is holding his first so
he's got an article in the hill and also
on his own website uh so the Republicans
now with their new majority in the house
are going to be looking into uh the
weaponization of government as they like
to say
and it's a variety of things but one of
the things you're looking into is the
FBI influencing social media
and we know at this point
we know
that the FBI really really had their
finger all over Twitter
possibly legally
in fact probably
legally
in the sense that they do have free
speech they can talk to anybody they
want they can express any opinion they
want
but we don't like it you know if it if
if all of that was legal and I think it
might have been might have all been
legal
the question is should it be and should
we allow it right and that's a different
question
um
but uh
one of the things that Turley said in
his article
I had been struggling to communicate and
I've failed completely and he Nails it
which is why you should follow him right
he he has a uniquely good ability to
write and just put things into simple
terms all right so here's his point
he said for years many politicians and
pundits have dismissed Free Speech
concerns
I was thinking of this FBI talking to a
Twitter thing they've dismissed Free
Speech concerns by noting that the First
Amendment only applies to the government
so long as corporations do the censoring
they contend it is not a free speech
problem
and that truly says this this obviously
is wrong on several fronts
now
here he does a better job of making this
point than irref he said the first
amendment is not the exclusive measure
of free speech uh corporate censorship
of political commentaries or news
stories are denials of free speech that
harm our democratic system and I'm
thinking
why why did I struggle so much to say
this simple thing like what this is
exactly my point which I've never said
clearly
which is that the first amendment is not
the only measure of free speech
because free speech is not just a thing
we put in the Constitution
free speech is why we're here
it's not just the Constitution it's the
whole it's the whole game
the whole game is free speech
everything we do that's right comes from
afraid speech like you couldn't have the
free market you couldn't you couldn't
have anything
so I don't know why it took Turley to
explain my own opinion to me but when
you see it in this this one sentence is
just perfect I keep reading it over and
over to myself the first amendment is
not the exclusive measure of free speech
just remember that sentence
how well constructed that one sentence
is it's not that because if he said it
almost any other way it wouldn't have it
wouldn't have hit as well so that's
really high level of writing skill
all right that's why you should follow
but if even if he didn't like his
opinions you should follow him as a
writer
all right turkey had a just we're gonna
move
the topic is going from Turley to Turkey
Charlie to Turkey
uh Turkey the country has had an
enormous earthquake 7.8 magnitude and it
it's pretty bad
the pictures from there were just
insanely bad
but one picture really caught my
attention
which is somehow there are
um a bunch of smartphone videos of a
10-story building that was it looked
like it was completely intact and then
just dissolved into the you know into
the basement
and they got that from them from the
moment before it happened until it was
gone it was all on video
and I looked at that and I said to
myself now somehow they probably knew it
was weakened they might have known it
was weakened by the earthquake
but I didn't see any obvious signs of
weakness it looked intact until it just
disintegrated and I'll tell you I have
never been more thankful
for government building codes
am I right
like looking for the you know the
positive and the tragedy here that
building would not have collapsed in
America
there are probably almost no buildings
in an earthquake zone anyway
and left in America that would have
collapsed like that and that wasn't the
oldest building it's not like it was an
ancient building it looks like it was
you know it might have been 40 50 years
old but it was you know in Modern Times
And
uh Haiti was the same thing yeah
yeah every once in a while you just have
to say yeah your government
may be doing a lot of terrible things
and they are
but U.S building codes have kept us
safer
you know I think I believe that we
should have a federal building code
and it should be taken away I think
States should have their own building
code but there should be a higher level
one a federal one
and the federal one should allow for
more experimental stuff you know people
who want to experiment a little bit but
the local zoning codes are a little
restrictive if you had one good tight
Federal one so somebody could say look
I'm either going to follow all the local
ones or I have an exception so the
exception will allow me to do just the
federal one now the federal one would
still have all the the good stuff in it
it just wouldn't be stupid
right you just allow you a little more
flexibility but you still have to you
know earthquake proof it and you know do
your best to make it safe I think that's
what we need
but it's hard to sell because you know
it just looks like it's regulations on
top of regulations when in fact it would
be the opposite
all right I saw a tweet this morning
from Senator John cornyn about the
health impacts of weed
and his tweet said pot is making people
sick Congress is playing catch-up
so there's you know there continue to be
more stories about the good and bad been
of weed
legalization and use
and here's the problem
we can't really measure the risk of of
either the benefits or the costs
right we actually don't know
so
and the reason we don't know is that the
the tests seem to be all over the place
you know there'd be a test that uh
people are getting more sickness but
then somebody will check the mortality
and they find it's the same
you know it could it be true that more
people smoke weed get emphysema
and yet the death rate is the same as
everybody else could be it could be
because maybe weed is giving some
benefits to some types of people while
being worse for other types of people
maybe it sort of balances them
now here's the biggest thing
we we as a human species we like to
treat mental health and physical health
like they're two separate things
but they're not you know if you have bad
mental health you're just as unhappy
just as crippled as if you had some
physical problem
or it could be so
if you if you look at mental health and
physical health as one ball
how do you measure the people who are
benefiting from weed
because surely there's you know surely
some people are worse off smoking
marijuana I think that's just a given
because you can just observe it I mean
you don't need to you don't need any
science for that do you would everybody
agree with that statement some people
are worse off
with weed
I think I think that's just guaranteed
would you also accept the possibility
there's some people and it might be a
very small set of people some people are
better off
let's say some people you know they
don't have to worry about their career
for whatever reason maybe they're
independently wealthy or they're an
artist like me
um and they you know don't operate
having equipment and their family
doesn't care and it's legal in their
state and
so you can imagine you can imagine a
special case
where somebody's better off
you know mentally especially and you
could imagine a case where people are
worse off
but how how would you
so how do you make a law
this is the same problem that I note
with guns
when we when we have the gun control
debate
it's all stupid
it's just all stupid
here's the only thing you need to know
about guns
they make some people safer
and they make some people less safe
does anybody disagree with that
yeah and and we're all lying when we
talk about guns unless you say that
unless you say what I just said you're
just lying
here's the LIE
that one of those two conditions either
guns are legal or they're restricted the
LIE is that one of those is the better
situation
it's not it's better for some people
it's worse for other people you can't
there's no way around that
no way around it now I understand the
arguments that even if it's bad for
people
you know you want that right because it
protects the country and whatnot but it
needs to be at least honest about it if
you can't say directly
uh you know gun gun freedom is good for
some people and it's definitely bad for
other people
but there might be one argument where
it's good for everybody
and this is one where we all go stupid
or or we go Democrat it's the same thing
in this case the Democrats are just
stupid about guns because they don't
understand how they would have any
impact in keeping America free
with my audience I don't even need to
explain that do I
because because they always say well
what's your AR-15 going to do against my
you know my Jets and my nuclear weapons
and you know I'm not going to go through
the whole explanation again how those
guns would not be used against your
nuclear weapons they would be used
against your police force
ask the police how well they would do in
a fight against their own citizens
how well do you think they do
because because you can't have a you
know big old fascist
organization unless you own the police
owning the military doesn't get it done
you have to own the police
and the police are outgunned
we outgun the police I don't tend to one
the the police would be if the police
decided to join the fascists
the citizens would surround the police
department
and Light It Up
it would it would last an hour
and you would have local control because
you would have wiped out the police
assuming the police became fascist
somewhat instantly and I don't think the
police would become the fascists I think
the police would join the citizens
that's what I think you know I don't I
don't think our police are are like you
know this close to becoming fascists I
think they're this close to becoming
on the on the side of Americans because
that's you know largely that's how they
were trained
so anyway the gun control debate I I
consider a phony debate because the
things we talk about are just pure
yeah it's just people not understanding
how guns would protect the country and
people not understand that the guns are
good for some people definitely
on average right and bad for some people
definitely
definitely
so if you know it's good for some people
and bad for some people how do you make
the decision
the way I would make the decision in
this context because you can't weigh
those two things and it's different
groups Etc is I would I would go to the
higher level of Liberty exactly yeah the
tiebreaker is Liberty
and I think you know I wouldn't say that
that's based on logic or science
but is certainly based on a preference
for
how civilization should be organized my
preference is if you can't agree on the
details you default to Liberty
does that make sense if you can't if you
can't agree on the cost benefit default
to Freedom
that that feels like
the process it just makes more sense
yeah but you only you won't see that
argument because it makes sense
um so when I talked about the
documentary effect where all
documentaries are persuasive even if
they shouldn't be
uh Elon Musk commented on it and agreed
with you know that being a risk in other
things as well and I got two million
views
on that tweet
so if you wondered what does an Elon
Musk comment on your Tweet do for you
two million views
now
I just have to say something about this
whole internet dad thing
you know I've talked before and again
internet dad is you know is inclusive of
all genders and non-binaries and
everything so the dad thing is just sort
of a shorthand for an adult who who's
taking some responsibility I guess
now
I think that this whole uh dad effect is
the biggest unreported
unreported power shift in the country
the number of kids who were influenced
by
um Andrew Tate
is huge it's huge whatever you want to
say about him his influence was huge
you know Jordan Peterson his influence
huge huge Elon Musk is influence huge
my influence you can decide for yourself
but in this case
because one internet dad agreed with the
point two million people saw it
and it's two million people who would
follow Elon Musk
so it's you know a certain type of you
know let's say more informed
you know people running the country kind
of people so every time you see this
effect
um
just watch How It's getting bigger and
and I would also argue
that we're either at or near the point
where if the the people I call the
internet dads and you know who they are
right you can make your own list of the
people who are somewhat independent and
they talk about political stuff and
social stuff and they're not gonna
they're not gonna just come down on one
side all the time they're going to
independently think about it and I think
that group is just getting more and more
powerful because other groups are harder
to trust
the internet dads
I honestly think are mostly in it for
the right reason
would you agree
would you agree that yeah make your own
list of mentalista who the internet dads
are and again you could add add women
and lgbtq and Robo sexuals and
non-binaries by the way why do the
non-binaries not get an n
shouldn't LBD lgbtq
have an N for non-binary
it's got a plus
or maybe they already added it I don't
know it's hard to keep up yeah Joe Rogan
would be one of the
one of the internet dads so keeping that
keep an eye on those Internet ads
all right we have reached act three in
uh Scott's uh public performance
uh do you know what I'm talking about
does everybody know what public
performance I've been putting on for the
last I don't know a few weeks
so it's about the pandemic and the
so-called coven shots
and we've boiled it down to the
uh the third Act
so in the third act Scott is uh wildly
criticized by all of his critics the
critics have been proven completely
right
Scott has been proven completely wrong
and now he must pay
he must pay
so that's the third act now in a movie
the third Act is where the protagonist
the the subject of the movie is in such
a problem that that person cannot
possibly get out of that problem
the the viewer of this movie says Ah
there's no way to get out of that you're
dead
but then as if by Magic
the protagonist escapes
we have reached act three
I promised you it was coming
I told you there was something common
see you were just getting all mad
because you were watching the first part
of the movie and you didn't know it was
a movie
if it's just the first part that would
just make you mad there's no relief
but we're reaching the part where
I try to escape from the third act trap
and
comic Dave Smith who
may or may not have some disagreements
with me on Long covet
I asked him how he calculated the risk
of long covet and by the way
that is the solution to the third Act
is one question
how did you calculate
your the risk of long covet
yes and and the question that we're
trying to settle is did the people who
got the right answer about the covet
shots
did they use a better process
a rational process that is superior to
mind
if they did then we should learn from
them especially I should learn from them
if they did not then it was guessing
and I characterized it as guessing
and then allowed people to defend
themselves
and after they defended themselves I I
followed up with one question
how did you calculate the odds of long
covet
so comic Dave Smith had a podcast which
I tweeted and you can you can search for
it just look for Dave Smith podcast and
you could add my name if you want to see
the episode
um
why do I don't know why people still say
here's the URL
isn't it easier just to say just Google
these terms
if it works every time I mean if you
Google comic Dave Smith and Scott Adams
the video you know the video pops right
up so do that
um but nine minutes in
he and his uh co-host talk about how
they handled the long coved calculation
now here's here's the setup
if they used a rational process
to look at all the risks and all the the
upside and downside even if the even if
they calculated it wrong
I would say that's a rational process
right because you can make a you know
you could have bad data or something
but is it a rational process and my my
line for rational is if you simply
considered all of the costs and all the
benefits if there was a big cost or a
big benefit
that you just ignored
I would call that guessing
in other words if you thought if you
pretended you were doing a rational
process but one of the biggest parts of
the decision you just ignored
that's just guessing it's just you think
it's not but it is because you're
guessing that the biggest variable
doesn't matter
so comic Dave Smith and his co-host
actually argued that the only thing he
needed to know was that the government
was completely
um
let's say not trustworthy
to which I said wait a minute
if you're only looking at if the
government is not trustworthy
you would have to say the government has
never made a correct decision and
there's never been a pharmaceutical drug
they approved that was good for you
would anybody say that
would anybody say that every drug
approved by the government is bad for
you
there's some chance that the government
approves something that's good for you
right is it zero
I I completely buy into the don't trust
the government when they're rushed don't
trust the government when lots of money
is involved don't trust them when they
show you their work and they say it
looks sketchy don't trust the government
when they say we'll let we'll let big
Pharma hide their data for 75 years
don't trust the government when they say
it usually takes five to ten years to
know but this time we did it in six
months or a year or whatever right so
Dave goes through all those reasons why
you should not trust the government do I
agree with it
yes yes
totally on the same page
and
here's how you know that people are
hallucinating about me
who in the world would believe that I
trusted scientist or the government
nobody did did they I don't think
anybody did they just took their best
shot based on what they knew and what
they didn't know
so
comic Dave Smith admits that he looked
at the distrust of government as his
primary decision-making thing and when
it came to Long covered they said he
believes it's a very low risk and
impossible to calculate
so what do you do when you believe
something's a very low risk that was
based on analysis
no that's a guess
he basically argued in public
that he didn't know that one of the
biggest factors so he acted like it
doesn't exist
and he said he thought the risk was
similar to getting hit by lightning and
if something is a very low risk if
something's a very low risk it's
reasonable to ignore it
do you know what else is a very low risk
vaccination injury
covet injury
long covet
all of it
the entire the entire domain is low risk
stuff so we're trying to compare a low
risk
of vaccine injury to a low risk of covet
injury to a low risk of covet death
right so he so his argument is that one
of them is low risk so you can't count
it
so is that analysis or is that guessing
to me that's just a laundered guess
right that's just a guess because you
don't know so you just guessed
and I think he says it directly
that's the third act now do you think he
would be the only person to take the
same tact
to explain that the government should
not have been trusted and somehow and
here's here's the logic Gap
somehow
I'm an educated well-informed person and
I'm the only person in the world who
didn't understand that the government
shouldn't be completely trusted in this
context
who would believe that
who would believe that I'm an educated
well-informed person but I'm the only
person in the country who missed the
fact
when every day I talk about the
government lying to us
every day
every day
four years for about an hour a day I
spent some of that hour talking about
how the government can't be trusted
do I not
you tell me do I do I not spend every
day in public telling you the government
can't be trusted and and do I say that
data on studies can totally be trusted
no every day for years I've told you
that you can't trust any of the data
about the pandemic or much of anything
else right but being the most skeptical
person you've ever met
comic Dave Smith's best theory about why
my opinion differs from him is that I
didn't pay attention to anything that
happened in the last two years that
somehow I'd missed it all
that's that's his working assumption
is that I missed all of it
uniquely
and that if I'd paid more attention to
one side of the argument
just one side of it I could have gotten
the right answer like he did but what I
did was make the terrible mistake
apparently of looking at all the risks
and realizing that they were
uncalculable and therefore
if you can't calculate the risks
you're guessing
comic Dave Smith says if you can't
calculate the risks
you're making a good decision
By ignoring them
now
here's something that I should say more
often
if you're an expert you know let's say
you have some experience of decision
making
you would say that looks crazy
and irrational right
and and I would guess that 100 of the
engineers are saying that right now
but here's something you should keep in
mind
the rational thinking is not a natural
ability
it's a it's a learned skill
scientists are not born scientists they
learn technique
I too have learned how to compare things
without leaving stuff out
I've spent years of you know both
educational attainment and you know
corporate experience of knowing what not
to leave out
so there's nothing wrong with comic Dave
Smith's brain
let me be as clear as possible he's a
real smart guy
he's a very smart guy who apparently
cares a great deal about his country and
the people in it
that's all good
that's all good
you want more Dave Smith's can we be
clear about that
the the more Dave Smith you have the
better the country is I said the same
thing about you know Brett and Heather
the more of them the better so I don't
have to agree with them to say that
they're adding value
they had a lot of value they add value
by disagreeing with me
I think their disagree with with me
enhances all of your knowledge because
it you know inspires me to make my
argument better right so this is all
good
you're see you're actually seeing the
best part of America right now
you're seeing Free Speech nobody nobody
stopped you know Adam
um from saying I'm sorry uh Dave Smith
from saying what he was saying
nobody stopped me from saying what I was
saying
and then you got to see what we both
said and then you can decide that's
that's that's as good as it gets you're
seeing the best
all right and there's another article
that uh made exactly the same point that
uh you can ignore the biggest risk if
you can't calculate it
people are saying that out loud
but you won't see any Engineers say it
you will see journalists
comedian and Entertainer say it
but you won't see any Engineers say it
here's what an engineer would say
specifically a data engineer named Joe
Moore who is also a real good follow on
Twitter and uh he often comes into my
my Twitter feed
to teach people how to think
and it's wonderful to watch
he's simply somebody who has learned how
to compare things and when people don't
do it right he goes into the comments
and teaches them so here's what he says
he says Scott's position is now remember
he's a data engineer so he's trained to
know how to make these decisions
Scott's position is it's impossible to
know the right decision and the podcast
dudes that was you know Dave Smith and
his co-host uh mock him and say it's
impossible to know the risk of long
covet so they ignored it
proves Scott's point exactly By ignoring
it they proved my point while thinking
they were proving their point
now again
these are smart people who are you know
high functioning people in society
well-meaning and there's nothing wrong
there's nothing wrong with the fact that
you don't know how to do stand-up comedy
and he's not trained to be a data
engineer
there's nothing wrong with that we're
just figuring it out best we can right
um
and then Joe Moore went on the second
tweet he says Scott isn't calling anyone
wrong never in terms of whether they got
vaccinated or not that's correct I've
never said I've never criticized any
individual decision
so Joe watches me so he knows that so he
says Scott isn't calling anyone wrong uh
specifically about the vaccination I am
calling people wrong about the decision
making
um it never has Dave admitted he
couldn't calculate long coven and so he
ignored it and then Joe asked this
question I like this I like this context
uh he says all the Lo all the bad stuff
speaking about the pandemic has low odds
and they list these these odds he goes
one percent one in a thousand one in a
hundred thousand one in a million which
number is the vax risk and which is the
long covet risk
I don't know
do you I don't know
that that's a pretty good point like the
difference between one you know one
percent or one in a thousand or one in a
million that's a really big difference
but I don't know which one of those is
which I can't even tell
would would comic Dave Smith know
if you saw three statistics would you
know which one's the long covid which
one's the you know dying from the
vaccination I don't know
all right
um
I'm going to do something that I thought
long and hard about
and I think it might be a huge mistake
but I'm going to do it here in public
because there's a there's a benefit to
it
I'm going to teach or politicians and
our corporate leaders
how to identify a Fang Fang in other
words a Chinese spy or any spy
um who is trying to befriend you the way
Fang Fang befriended
um swallow
all right now
there is a pattern
that you can identify them now I don't
know anything about how how Fang Fang
infiltrated the swallow organization
but he was a councilman
in a in a smallish town
mid-sized town so it was a council
council person now the first thing you
need to know
is that
um they they try to influence people
early on in their career
so I got a phone call I'm not a phone
call I got a text the other day
that is either a scam
is definitely not a real person it's
either a scam
or it's a Fang Fang uh Chinese spy who
is trying to get to me while I'm still
in my let's say not too influential
stage
now I'm not going to claim this is an
actual spy contact right
if the FBI wants the phone number that
it came from I'd be happy to give it to
him but here's the problem
what if they already have it
what if the number that texted me is
already
known as a Chinese spy because I feel
like we probably know some of them don't
we you know don't we have ways to
identify who the spies are
if in fact
this is a known spy
then there's a good chance that the FBI
is already looking at all of my private
conversations because I believe that's
legal
give me give me a give me a fact check
on that
if they knew for sure that a spy was
contacting me and I'm telling you that
maybe that happened
wouldn't they have access to all of my
private Communications
I think so
and if they don't already they're going
to have it now
because I'm telling you that I had a
contact
that in my opinion looks suspicious
now they don't even need to know for
sure that it's a spy right
they would only have to suspect it's a
spy and then they could look at all of
the spies Communications but also the
communications of anybody they contacted
all of it
I believe
I believe they'd have all of it now
here's a little rule that I would like
to teach you
you never had privacy
you never had privacy
it's not it's not attainable
we don't live in the system where
anybody has privacy
the only way that you can stay safe is
to be uninteresting
so that nobody cares to look but the
government always had the ability to you
know do a court order and look at all
your stuff
they just needed a reason and they
didn't need a good reason that's one
thing we learned from the fisa stuff
they don't need a good reason
they need anything that a judge would
look at on a piece of paper and go all
right well whatever I don't have time to
look into it but if you say
so I'm going to read you the contact as
it happened and then I'm going to teach
you how to identify
how a spy would operate now I'm going to
make the following claim
that I know how a spy would operate
don't ask me how I'm not a spy I'm not a
spy but don't ask me how I know that
I just know it all right
so let me find
the communication here and I'll read it
to you as it happened
all right the first text came in and it
was only a phone number
and it was a 617 area code
which I think is uh Massachusetts area
all right so the first message says I'll
be in California next Saturday would you
like to eat Korean barbecue together
now I often get
um spammy things and I get scammers so I
thought oh it's just a scammer but it
could be somebody had a wrong number
so what what did I do
I ignored it
because I ignore all the things that
look like they're not for me or it's a
scammer so I just ignore it a few days
go by I get a follow-up message are you
really are you really busy that you
don't have time to reply to my message
now that's interesting
that's interesting now the first thing
you need to know is that a spy
would try to meet you accidentally
it has to look accidental
so here's somebody meeting me
accidentally
and the first thing they they asked
about was Korean barbecue now nobody who
knows me well would invite me to a
Korean barbecue because I don't eat red
meat
so there's nobody who would casually ask
me to lunch
for a Korean barbecue so I know they
don't know me right
so I replied thinking that there was
some possibility it's somebody who just
had a wrong number and I didn't want to
ruin her day
I didn't want to ruin her day in case
you know in case it's just a friend
they're trying to catch up with so I
said I don't know who this is from
obviously no one who knows me based on
the message
and then it comes back and the best says
it's me
and I won't say the name just on the off
chance that it's a real person but it's
an Asian first name
uh Asian as in somebody not born in this
country maybe or maybe a second
generation person with with a Asian
sounding name
uh and then I replied uh I said I don't
know you you must have a wrong number so
I'm already right my my alert is already
up
that this is you know a scam or
something but there's some possibility
some small possibility it's like a real
person who has a wrong phone number
so I want to help him out I said I don't
know you must have a wrong number and
then I said who do you think I am
and then the yes will come back are you
Jesse
j-e-s-s-e
now I said no not Jesse that's the
problem uh have a good trip I hope you
do connect so now I've I've just closed
I've closed the circuit
everything this person needs to know is
now known I'm not the person they're
looking for
and I said have a nice day now if it's a
real if it's a real woman
what would that real woman do next
what would a real woman do
sorry I bothered you Boop or or nothing
right but nobody keeps talking after
that am I right
nobody keeps talking after that
next message was
oh I input the wrong number sorry oh
okay so now we're done
that's the end of it right
so I think well that's the end of it
then another message comes in thanks for
being nice
oh okay you still could be nice this
still could be real
then the third one comes in I haven't
answered the first two
are you in California
there it is there it is
there's the tell all right as soon as
this question was asked we can now
eliminate real person
correct
we've eliminated the possibility as a
real person because zero real people who
are women
follow up with a man that they don't
even know his name keep in mind
she doesn't even know my name allegedly
like allegedly she doesn't know my name
but I think she does
so
I wanted to tease this out a little bit
so I said I am in California so probably
same area code as your friend
so I'm playing along at this point
so I'm giving her a reason why she would
have asked the question oh because
you're both the same area code maybe
that's how you got the wrong phone
number
and then uh and then she answers yeah
here's my childhood friend but we used
to study together when we were in Hong
Kong
used to study together when they were in
Hong Kong
now what what what information do I
have about this person so far
here's what I know
I know that they have an Asian some kind
of connection to Asia I know that
they're young enough that they're
talking about uh studying studying
together in Hong Kong
so so the age of the person is sort of
not too long after college
so she's sort of identifying herself in
her 20s ish probably
and she's saying that she lived in Hong
Kong
now why would you say you studied in
Hong Kong do do a lot of people
internationally travel to Hong Kong just
to study or did they
or is it the safest way to say you're a
Chinese resident
because
um
so I said after she said yeah here's my
childhood friend but we used to study
together when we were in Hong Kong now
nobody needs to tell that to a stranger
I'm a stranger who did not need to know
anything about Jesse or or anything
about their history this is clearly a
tell
that something scammy is going on right
so I try to close it down but really I'm
testing to see if she stops right
so it looks like I'm trying to close the
conversation but I wasn't
what I was trying to do is close it in a
way that any normal person would be done
but I wanted to see if there was more
so I said good luck finding him
exclamation mark
all right that's just done right good
luck finding him
next message I live in Florida
I didn't ask
I never asked
I had already checked the area code it
was for Massachusetts but it says you
know but that doesn't mean anything
um
and then the next text and I don't even
answer says I live in Florida I ignore
it next text is have you have you ever
been here
have I ever been to Florida
like why would she ask a stranger whose
name she doesn't even know
if I've been to Florida
all right so now I'm I'm going to draw
around a little bit so I go many times
and then I text are you Chinese by
citizenship
so I said are you Chinese by citizenship
and she answered yeah I am
do you have Asian friend
do you have Asian friend so that the the
Asian friend thing suggests it could be
just a scam you know not necessarily a
spy
so my next message was is your name Fang
Fang LOL
and she responds nope haha I'm and then
she tells her name first and last name
that are uh Chinese sounding and then
you can call me blah blah by my first
name
now I didn't answer after that and that
was that was the end of the end of The
Exchange
so here's what you look for
you look for an accidental meeting that
looks accidental might not be accidental
so it's it happens in the normal course
of life and swallows in swalwell's case
it was probably somebody who joined his
campaign
and it looked like somebody who just
liked his politics
you you also want to look out for the
right the flattery and the flirting this
out of context
nobody flirts with a stranger and that
no woman flirts with a man she knows
nothing about that she called by
accident that doesn't happen so so the
reason that that would work with anyone
is that men will believe anything
if it's a compliment to them if you tell
the man that the you know the the most
beautiful woman in the world is maybe
flirting with him the first thing he's
going to think is maybe she is right so
we're very easily to easy to fool with
flattery
so flattery accidental meeting and then
following up too much way too much
interest giving too much information in
this case she started early by
mentioning Hong Kong and studying
the Hong Kong thing I believe was to
Prime me so that once I found out if I
did that she was a Chinese citizen
she would have a reason to explain that
she's one of the good ones
because if you were a Hong Kong resident
before China took over well yeah maybe
you're a Chinese resident now
but you were one of the the freedom ones
you weren't necessarily one of the
Communist ones
I don't think it's a coincidence
that she mentioned Hong Kong to you know
right off the bat to be able to frame
herself as one of the the good Chinese
citizens by the way all Chinese citizens
are good I'm not saying anything except
the government of China has issues
um
you don't like my absolute
so look for
the person who's willing to admit
they're a Chinese I imagine the Fang
Fang was very open about her connections
to China just guessing
and that she probably had a whole
explanation of a backstory that would
make her look like she was safe
all right
now how many of you would have
recognized this as a potential Chinese
spy
how many of you would have
thought potential spy
foreign
good good
now how many of you think that somebody
at my level of
um
I don't know public exposure
would be approached by a Chinese spy
I think so yeah I would imagine that a
lot of people who talk about politics on
both sides
have had maybe a casual contact with
somebody who acted a little friendly
so anyway
um
that's your lesson on how to how to spot
a spy now I don't know if it was a spy
you know you can't be 100 sure it could
have been just a you know romances uh
scam kind of a thing
uh
but everything about it suggested
Chinese spy
am I flattered no it's just creepy
like all I thought about it was oh this
is creepy
but it also tells you to uh
to be careful
right
you think it was a bot scale you think I
was talking to a bot
there were typos I don't think so
all right what top secret stuff do I
know
I don't know do I know any it depends
what top secret means I guess I don't I
don't know anything that nobody knows
I know things that not many people know
but I don't know what a top secret would
be in this context
yeah so if if it had been if I had taken
it further I could find out for sure
here's how I'd find out for sure
if it was a muddy scam
the way it would work out is oh you know
uh I can't get a hold of Jesse but I I'd
love to visit California
and then see if she could get me to say
you know I'm single
I could I could show you around
something like that and then and if it's
a scam
uh then the next thing would happen is
she'd say okay I'm booking my flight
but my credit card got stolen
so I can't book the flight and there's
only an hour left to get this price oh
my goodness if I don't know what to do I
guess I can't come
and that's when I'm supposed to offer oh
but you could temporarily use my credit
card and then pay me back
you know so it'd be something like that
so if she
if I had made plans to see her because I
believe she was just sort of interested
in me Against All Odds at some point
there would be an emergency on her end
that required immediate funding to to
make the trip
if that didn't happen
and she actually flew all the way out
here funded it herself and said oh I
have a job I don't need any money
that would be a Chinese spy
for sure
because it's not a real person no real
person does that
uh and if she paid for everything yeah
oh wow you had a fake person calling
saying they knew you yeah that's
huh
I don't know why I'm thinking about this
this is the most random thing I saw a
pickup line
that somebody on Instagram was was
saying was a pickup line
tell me if I've told you this one before
as soon as I heard it I thought that is
the most persuasive pickup line I have
ever heard
all right you walk up to somebody at
let's say uh let's say it's a business
event
but you're definitely in flirting mode
now maybe not a business event let's say
it's a social event you get the business
out of it it's a social event
and you you walk up to somebody or maybe
it's not it doesn't have to be a social
event and a man says to the woman
there's no reason for you to look this
good today
that is the best pickup line
because what is a woman going to say to
that
no woman ignores that
every woman will engage on that question
though there's no reason for you to look
this good today
and it's completely different than just
giving a compliment if you walked up and
say you look beautiful I just had to
tell you well that's kind of creepy
but if you walk up and you criticize her
for looking better than she needs to
that's totally different that's like the
the nagging the so-called like insult
compliment is built into the first
sentence you don't have a reason to do
it meaning that your brain your brain
isn't working right
yeah you look good big deal you didn't
have a reason to do it
if you do it with a smile and you know I
think the I think the person would get
that you're just being clever
but they would also engage it's like
what do you mean
what do you mean yeah and then get
another compliment blah blah blah
goodbye Sharon
Sharon you don't seem like a good person
so we'll take we'll get rid of you
uh what about Ukraine
you're sending prayers my way good
thank you
clipped oh you clipped that
all right uh there's not much happening
in Ukraine is there is there anything
happening in Ukraine today except people
lying about what's happening in Ukraine
I think some days the only the only
lesson about Ukraine that I'll give you
um
the only lesson is that I don't believe
anything that comes out of Ukraine
if you do that's on you
all right that's all for now YouTube
I'll say bye I'm going to talk to the
locals people a little bit more
bye for now
