to undoubtedly
a peak experience of your life
i'm talking
gold medal experience here
not sulfur not copper
gold metal all the way and if you'd like
to take it up to whatever is beyond that
and it's almost beyond imagination
all you need is uh oh it's a bronze okay
you don't want that either all you need
is a copper marker or glass a tanker
challenger's time to get to each other a
glass vessel to the kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
oh we've got a problem with the audio
which i'm going to fix
right now
because i think i know that problem hold
on
all right youtube
with any luck
what i just did fixed your sound
anybody anybody
all right well
so we're still bad on youtube
interesting let's see
i've got
oh i know the problem
air gap
[Laughter]
maybe if i plugged it in
how about now
anybody
anybody
all right
so
here's something to learn
you know sort of a learning moment
um the reason i use ipads instead of
other things is that i just keep them on
and just set up all the time if you make
any change to your setup you end up with
this and yesterday i said to myself you
know
i wouldn't mind watching a show while
i'm doing some drawing
so i changed one thing on one ipad and
forgot to change it back
don't ever be like me
but how would you like to simultaneously
sip interrupted
we're gonna take it up from where we
began
go well i'm pretty sure the rest of the
show will be better than that
rocky start
according to a rasmussen poll um 58
percent of the public agree
that the media is the enemy of the
people
now this is similar to how it's been
in prior months
but every time i see this i just shake
my head
how much of this was just trump
do you remember in the earliest days
when people were mocking me for saying
that trump was persuasive
and and oh my god
the level of
you know hate i got
for suggesting that whether you liked
him or didn't like him whether you liked
his policies or not
the one thing you couldn't deny
is that he was persuasive
and now 58 of the people think the news
is fake
that was him
am i wrong
i mean it was all of us to you know
piling on
but i don't think we would be even half
of that number without trump
specifically
i don't think anybody's ever been more
persuasive than that i mean that is a
big deal
so let's we'll talk about some uh the
news's uh
performance here as we go
the latest story is that uh
lots of news entities are reporting that
trump quote improperly
improperly i say
removed documents from the white house
and store them at mar-a-lago
some of them included stuff like the uh
so-called love letters with kim jong-un
and some other stuff
and
all i have to say about this is
the walls are closing in on trump
yeah you thought russia collusion was
going to take him down
it didn't we're all amazed
you thought grab them by the room
keep them from being president nope
didn't stop them a bit
did you think that the fake news about
charlottesville and drinking bleach fake
news do you think they were gonna take
him out
nope
uh he escaped all that what about his
legal problems with his his taxes and
his his uh
well mostly his taxes
so far doesn't look like anything well
but uh you know what about michael cohen
and storm he did well yeah it didn't
really seem to make much difference in
the end
what about all the
i don't know i think we're down to this
aren't we
that
bastard
improperly took documents
which are almost certainly
digitally saved in somewhere anyway
am i wrong in assuming that every
document is digitally archived no matter
whether you have the document or not am
i wrong about that
don't you think wouldn't everything be
digitally archived at this point
i don't know
so i don't even know what it means to
take a document out of the white house
once it's been digitally
stored and i'm just guessing i mean i'm
just guessing they would all be
digitally archived
but it seems reasonable
so
this is what has come to
all all of the insurrection talk
everything it all came down to
well i think some of those documents
that we have digital pictures of have
been improperly
improperly stored
what are we going to do to fix this
situation oh we just
took them back where they were supposed
to be
that was that
that was it
so trump gave joe rogan some advice
trump did a
press release and because he's trump i'm
going to read his exact words
because nobody writes
like he writes
you could not write in his voice if you
tried i mean it would look like it was
obviously a joke but i swear nobody
writes like he does nobody and it is
really sensational writing
from taking it from a professional
writer
if you could write as well as trump does
you would be a best-selling author he
does he does write at that level it's
just that he does it so
in such a sort of a folksy plain manner
that you don't take it that way but it's
brilliant writing
so so here's what he said in the
press release rogan is an interesting
and popular guy but he's got to stop
apologizing to the fake news and radical
left maniacs and lunatics how many ways
can you say you're sorry
joe
just go about what you do so well and
don't let them make you look weak and
frightened
that's not you and never will be
so
that's very trumpy
and is well written in a trump style
so i like everything about that i like
you know
every basically persuasion wise writing
wise communication wise it's just an a
plus
but
here's my take on it
remember i said that you should be
careful about giving joe rogan advice
because of the obvious reason
whatever decisions joe rogan makes got
him to where he is
and whatever decisions you make in life
got you to where you are
who's doing better if you're doing
better than joe rogan
well maybe you would be exactly the
person to give him some advice
but if you're not
maybe be a little humble
about
the value of your advice versus the
value of his own opinions right
now here's my take on his apology
some of you said it is strategically bad
to apologize
and i get that so i'm not going to
disagree with you on this strategy
so strategically it probably is a bad
idea to look weak and apologize but
here's the thing i think everybody's
overlooking
what if he meant it
well why why do we even why do we
discount let me think about this
we kind of discount the possibility that
he was sincere
why
why
why is what is it that joe rogan has
ever done
in his at least public life that we know
about what has he ever done
that would suggest he would give an
insincere apology
i can't think of anything that would be
inconsistent with basically everything
we know about him
now that doesn't mean yeah we're right
or we can read his mind or any of that
but just in terms of consistency
he is
and one of the reasons he's so popular
he's one of the most pop most credible
people in the world
credible in the sense that you think
he'll give an honest opinion even if
he's wrong
here's my take
i don't think he apologized for economic
reasons
there was an economic reason
but i think he actually felt it
did you did you get the sense that he
was apologizing
fakely
i didn't get that at all
i think that he was genuinely
unhappy with how it looked
i think he was again we're we can't read
his mind but i'm just the only thing we
can look at is the consistency in his
history
if the history and the consistency
suggests
that any apology he gives actually he
means
that is none of our business
it isn't it's not trump's business it's
not my business
it's not your business
if if he felt and i'm just saying if
because we'd have to speculate about his
inner thoughts
but if he thought
that he honestly owned an apology
that's the end of the conversation
it doesn't matter if it's strategically
smart
it really doesn't
because it's it's not our life it's not
our lives to manage
and it's not us it's not up to us to
decide
should he put strategy over his own
just sense of what is right or wrong
i know
i i get that strategically it was
suboptimal
but maybe it wasn't
maybe it wasn't
because again
uh if my podcast
if my podcasts were anywhere near
the successes of his i would say well
you should take my opinion on everything
look at what i've done
but again
maybe being genuine and apologizing in a
way that at least it may look completely
genuine
maybe that is the very best thing to do
how would you know
right if it's an opinion and his
opinions got him to where he is and your
opinions got you to where you are
i don't know
i think i would defer to his opinion on
whether an apology was
necessary or useful and and keep in mind
that you know he's also solving
personal issues beyond the business
model right
because this was a problem that was
not just a business problem it was a
personal problem
so
i don't judge him good or bad effective
or ineffective to me that looked like
something he thought he needed to do
and if he thought he needed to do it
that's the end of the question
isn't it
it should be it should be the very end
of it it's like oh he thought that was a
good idea he did it for himself
if he's happy with it
i'm happy with it
if you don't brainwash your own kids
what's going to happen
they don't grow up being independent
thinkers
that's not an option
if you don't brainwash your kids
somebody's going to do it
the school is going to do it social
media is going to do it etc and i think
that in our modern world we've kind of
delegated the brainwashing to the
schools and the news and social media
and their friends and stuff
so at the point at this point kids are
just like free-range chickens it seems
like you know they
they leave the house to go to school in
the morning
they come home they're with their
friends they're doing homework you may
or may not even see them before they go
to bed
you might not eat a meal together
you know they're sort of being
socialized without your parental
guidance in a lot of cases
but
how much damage is that
well it turns out that uh there's some
thoughts by the professionals that
tick-tock in particular
is super dangerous especially to young
females
so here's a quote from one expert uh
paul sanseri a psychologist
and
he says a quote for uh i think this was
on cnn
they said for a young girl who's
developing her identity to be swept up
into a sexual world talking about
tick-tock videos like that is hugely
destructive
he also said uh
when teen girls are rewarded for their
sexuality they come to believe that
their value isn't how they look he said
he said approximately a quarter of the
female patients at his clinic have
produced sexualized content on tick tock
now i wouldn't trust that percentage
because something tells me that
a quarter of everybody who's ever a
quarter of all females probably have
made
sexually suggestive content on tick tock
right a quarter of the people using tick
tock
that sounds like just
probably the right number of
people in general
and it's the 25 percent again yeah the
magic 25 percent
um
so do you believe this
do you take this as sort of obviously
true or would you need some more science
to make the case
to me i would say this is obviously true
it looks obviously true
the kids are obsessed
by looks and sex appeal
obsessed
but are teenagers always obsessed by
that
maybe they always were
does it really make it worse
probably because it's so visual and so
overwhelmingly there all the time so i
would imagine that just the fact that
it's visual
and the fact that you spend so much time
on it probably causes
problems
now here is a prediction um
you know i've made some unusual
predictions
way outside the mainstream
i'm going to make a way outside the
mainstream prediction
that social media will eventually be
banned for children under a certain age
now at the moment you'd say to yourself
that can't happen because the social
media companies are just too powerful
they can just make sure they don't get
banned
i don't think so
i think that over time it will become so
obvious
that it's child abuse actual child abuse
that as soon as somebody frames it as
child abuse maybe i just did
it's sort of a
one-way trip after that
you can't really come back from that i
think i think the science is going to be
overwhelmingly
certain
that social media is absolutely
dangerous for developing minds
or maybe there needs to be some you know
crippled version of social media or
something but
the age should be set around 70.
you're safe after about 70.
i i think 21.
yeah
i think age 21 would be about right for
legal social media access
all right um
by the way does anybody agree with my
prediction how many of you think it will
happen
because i would think most of you would
disagree with that
see some yeses and knows
no no
gonna be hard yeah the power of the
social media companies is pretty great
and they can
they can make us not know that they're
what they're doing is bad for us
so they control the harm
but also also the information about the
harm
so you won't know how much damage there
is if they don't tell you and it's not
in their interest to tell you
so here's the question that i think is
fascinating about the ukraine situation
so putin sort of painted himself in the
corner there he can't really attack
without bad things happening to russia
and he can't not attack
so what's he going to do
and
here's a question i ask
what does war look like in 2022
if the
highest advanced countries are involved
you know the countries that can produce
the best
weapons
what happens if two of them are at least
you know even if it's a proxy war
what if
what if the best weapons are turned
against the armies of the other
because the ukrainians might not have
access to the best weapons
or maybe they do
what do we know
do you think we would know in public
what the secret new really good weapons
the ukrainians will have access to
they shouldn't tell us
if we know
then maybe it's in the
you know in the context of trying to
convince russia not to attack
but
i feel like it's obvious things are
going to go poorly if they attack i
think putin must know that it's going to
be expensive
so
here's what i'm
wondering is going to happen
uh number one if if putin attacks the
capital of ukraine
wouldn't you say that he's attacking a
civilian population
you would right if he if he takes over a
city
especially the capital
it's not really army on army it's going
to be mass
mass casualties of civilians
if that happens do you think that the
ukraine
uh
ukrainian people
have a moral
a moral let's say
let's say are they morally
um i guess it's never moral
what do you think that they would um
return the favor
do you think the ukrainians would attack
a russian city
now probably not with a straight
military attack because that would be a
little difficult to pull off
but you don't think that there are
already ukrainian
operatives in russia
i would assume so
right
i would assume that they've penetrated
russia it wouldn't be that hard
especially if they have a lot of
russian-speaking people they look the
same speak the same
so
what would happen
if these
alleged speculative ukrainians who
wanted to give as good as they're
getting
decided to take moscow around and they
had access to the best weaponry
and strategies of the united states
i'm not saying that's true
i'm saying
seems likely
it seems likely that the ukrainians
would want to attack directly into the
heart of russia to make it really hurt
i mean if it's all about war it's all
that war am i right
if it's all that war
ukrainians can attack muslim moscow with
the population
they can
and what would they do to
how would they do that well
i would do it with drones
if you had one drone per each ukrainian
operative and you had say dozens of
operatives
and they all reduced re released their
suicide drones at the same time
i'm not talking about the big ones that
are the size of aircraft
i'm talking about the ones that can
carry enough weight
to take out a you know sizeable you know
floor of a building let's say
i don't know how many of them they would
have to drop on moscow before moscow
said
we're out you know we don't support this
war i don't know if they support it or
if it matters but
i i feel like
russia has to calculate
a certain amount of destruction in
moscow as part of their calculation am i
wrong
is there any part of what i said is
wrong
and i'll just put it in more general
terms
number one does ukraine have a right to
attack a population center in russia i
say yes
anybody disagree
only if they get attacked first
does anybody disagree that they would
have the right
to attack a population center
any disagreement at all
i don't think so right that's war that
the the reason you don't go to war
is that
right i mean more than anything
it's that one thing because it always
happens yes
so if they have the right to attack do
they have the ability
well i think the ability would depend on
how how well they could penetrate russia
and given that they look russian
they speak russian
they're on the border
probably right
you know why would the ukrainians not
have operatives in russia it doesn't
make sense russia has plenty of
operatives in ukraine one assumes
so if you know those two
two things are true they would have the
right and the
um
let's say the incentive to attack moscow
population center
they would certainly have the people
all they would need is the technology
that's all they would need
the technology exists
all they would need is somebody to give
it to them
could the united states
you know covertly
supply suicide drones to ukrainian
operatives
totally
does anybody think they couldn't do that
now i'm not saying they would
and maybe the united states doesn't even
need to be involved
maybe the ukrainians can get all the
drones they want just through i don't
know black market or whatever
so i have a feeling
that putin's going to have to look at a
a lot of destruction in moscow
as the cost of attacking ukraine and by
the way
the ukrainians should say that directly
they should say that directly
they should say that moscow is a target
if there's an evasion
they don't have to give any details
just say it just say it clearly
if we're attacked
if you take over our capital you're
going to lose the capitol building in
moscow or i don't know wherever the
capital is
who knows
they should they should put a target
list out and say you're going to lose
these targets
we're going to take out this this and
this and there's nothing you could do to
stop it
not with suicide drones right if they
have suicide drones there's nothing they
could do to stop it so they can just
tell you what the cost is
we're going to take out your tallest
building
we're going to take out your
your your government building
and then name a few others military
headquarters whatever
anyway
i don't think putin's gonna attack
i don't think he's gonna attack and this
would just be one of the reasons
um but i could be wrong about that
let's uh the mandates seem to be
bending if not breaking
so a number of states have now announced
masking will go away they've given dates
our own governor newsom has said that
indoor masking
will partially go away in terms of the
state's mandates
so the schools and the
i guess the towns or counties can still
mandate stuff
but the the state of california will be
out of the mandating business for masks
as of
february 15th
now let's say you lived in california
and you knew that what's today the
eighth
if you knew in one week
that the mask mandate was going to be
dropped
are you going to wear your mask
between now and the 15th
all right my mask i haven't worn my mask
since
the first you know i told you all that
that was my last day
so i wore once in a doctor's office
that was really just a sign of respect
it had nothing to do with anything else
it was brief so i didn't care
so
do you think that february 14th
on valentine's day
that people are going to wear masks when
they go out to eat
well i mean we don't
in california nobody really wore masks
to eat anyway
so yeah you just walked past the hostess
at that point
so i would say that the governor really
had no choice governor newsom in at
least letting the mandates expire
because he got caught without his mask
in a very public way we all saw that
story so i don't think he could extend
it i think it was politically impossible
for him to extend it but here's what i
do think
waiting until the 50th is weak and
stupid and it's just a big you
am i right
like
on one hand i want to i want to
support the governor in ending the
mandates
so part of my instinct is yay
you're ending the mandates but then i
then i started thinking with my actual
brain and stuff
and i say
really are you telling me that waiting
this extra week
is going to make a difference
nobody believes that
literally no one no one no one in the
whole world
believes that that extra week
is going to make a difference
so governor newsom
you dick
end it today
you're just being a dick
if you don't end it today and guess what
it's over today
because you're a
dick right the only reason he's not
ending it today
is because it's going to time out anyway
and he's a and he's just
going to let it timeout so he doesn't
have to make an actual decision it'll
look like a non-decision right what a
weak
weak
pathetic way to run a
state
pathetic
if you're deciding it's going to be gone
next week it's gone now
just admit it it's over
i'm not going to wear a mask
for a week
i don't well i wasn't going to wear one
anyway but
who is going to wear a mask for a week
when you know it's already over
you're just being an at this
point all right it's one thing to follow
the science
and i get the fact that you know there's
some judgment involved but once you've
decided to end the mask mandate
just get it over with pull the
band-aid off why do you have to leave
the scab for the public
right why does the public have to pick
off with scab
sorry mixing analogies here but this is
incompetence at a level that's just in
 you in your face
right it's one thing to make a mistake
and you're not sure who's doing the
right thing you're on one team and you
wish it would go this way this isn't
like that this has nothing to do with
teamwork politics priorities this is
just you
that's all it is
this is just you to the public
anybody disagree
anybody does anybody disagree this is a
pure you
in
and it's
and it's
it's put in the form
of they're doing us a favor
yeah thank you for dropping
the
mask mandate they shouldn't have been
there and you can't do it today
it's over today
californians
californians listen to me
don't put on your masks
just don't do it
it's over
your leader just gave up
all right he decided that he wasn't even
going to try
i don't know why i don't care why
but if he's not going to even try
masks are done
and
let us stop pretending
that we're following the science
can we
can we stop pretending
because there's nothing about there's
nothing like that happening when you see
the cdc have a different opinion than
the governors every governor has a
different opinion
way even when the situation is largely
the same
obviously following the science is not a
thing
it's obviously not a thing
we should have learned that by now
so
the new york times apparently is
admitting that
in in a sense admitting that ron
desantis was right about not masking
kids
so the new york times is saying get rid
of the mask cnn is saying get rid of the
masks uh that seemed to be a big
i mean it seemed to be a change on cnn
maybe it's happened already governors
are dropping in various states
it is over
governor newsom
it's just over
you just being an at this point
there's just no other way to express it
it's not politics anymore it's not
science it's not politics this is just
 behavior
pure behavior
right you take your mask off at
the game and pose for pictures and then
you make us wait a week
that is not politics and it's not a
science it's behavior
and
you don't have to put up with it
all right
um
so what do you think about
science
is it fair to say at this point
that trust the science is just a way to
launder an opinion
it is right
because if trusting the science were a
real thing
all the governors would be ending the
mass mandates
the cdc would agree with all the
governors
and all the experts because they would
just follow the science
that was never a real thing
follow the real science was always
propaganda it was never
about reason or ration because if we've
learned anything it's that we can't tell
what the science is or where it's
heading
as long as it's human beings who are
interpreting what the science said
we don't know what the science says
we only know what a person said
and people are not science
people are whatever is the opposite of
science
so
i think we should agree at this point
that we have proven that following the
science is a bad idea when the public
and the politicians are interpreting
what the science is
and that's
basically all the time
following the science is a good idea for
who
follow the science is a good idea for
scientists
right
it's a great idea for scientists
if you're a scientist
you should probably follow the science
i'd recommend it
but if you're the public and you know
everybody's lying about what the science
is or they can't tell what the science
is
then it is nothing but laundering of
opinion
they're using science to launder an
opinion to make it look like it's backed
by something that's all it is it's just
laundered opinions
fake news
so orange county will not be dropping
the mass mandates in cal oh i'm sorry
orange county will drop the mandates
as the governor is
but not los angeles county
so there's a director of whatever down
there barbara ferrer
she says l.a county will not lift his
mass mandate on february 15th
because why she's following the science
does the governor have different science
than they have in l.a
this is behavior
it is behavior
we have to stop saying this is science
or politics
this is not science this is not politics
it's not even close it's just
behavior at this point pure
behavior nothing else and if you even
imagine or have a conversation with
anybody about science at this point
you're wasting your time
you should have a conversation about
who's being an
and that's it
speaking of biden science
advisor eric lander quits over his
behavior toward the staff
apparently in a perfect simulation
related story
the guy who's the head science advisor
for the administration turns out to be
wait for it
wait for it
biden's science advisor
turns out to be a gigantic
a gigantic
so much of an
that he has to like
has the special requirements
around him just to keep his job
like he needs the guideline or
your guard rails be sure if be sure if i
do anything that offends you that you
tell somebody let me know right away
and he keeps his job
yeah this is one of the promises that
biden made us
no in his administration and
then he kept one
why because he probably needs to launder
his opinions through the science that's
why
no that's probably not why but it's
funny to say
so rachel maddow's on hiatus which
basically takes out ms msnbc as a
persuasive
uh network
as long as rachel maddow is out and it's
not clear that she'll come back
permanently
but as long as she's out
she has by far the most popular show or
did
on msnbc msnbc is going to become
a lot closer to irrelevant
in the next election cycle
what about cnn
well rasmussen had a poll
asking how many people regularly watch
cnn
not many
i don't remember the exact numbers but
it's pretty small
not many
so you've got cnn that is filled with uh
sex criminals allegedly
and zucker retiring
and their reputation in tatters
and not many people watch and they've
got msnbc which gutted
itself when rachel maddow took her thing
so at this point
look at the relative power of
msnbc plus cnn
compared to the last election cycle
it's really different
now compare fox news's influence
fox news is still strong
am i right
and i would say at this point that the
media advantage is just overwhelmingly
on the right
because the left just sort of fell apart
on its own
nobody took the left down
the left didn't need to be taken down
it just took itself down
for different reasons
so
i don't think that we have come to
grips yet with how big of a difference
this could be because remember nobody
nobody uses facts and science to make
decisions
we're all being brainwashed by our
favorite sources
and here's the big sea change that i
don't think has been recognized yet
it's the roganization of america
i keep saying that in various contexts
because you keep seeing it in different
contexts
everything is becoming about joe rogan
but it's not really about joe rogan is
it
you know what i mean because when it's
about trump it's not really always just
about trump
it's a you know
they they come to symbolize a larger or
something
so joe rogan
represents
credible
credible in the sense of honest not
incredible in the sense of being right
about everything that's not a standard
anybody can meet
would you all agree
that being right about everything is not
really a standard you can expect people
to meet
nobody's going to do that
but
you can at least get credible
you can at least see both sides
you can at least get somebody honestly
trying to give you the truth
so i think the roganization of america
is continuing meaning that the
the traditional media will become less
and less important um and the
the independent
people
such as joe rogan
will become more important and that
there's a really big change coming into
this next two elections
am i right
i i think that the
the podcaster voice
probably went from
20 percent of the persuasion
to i think in this next cycle
40 to 60 percent
what would you say
i think that's a really big change and i
think a crossover is going to happen the
crossover where the um the the
independent pundits
are going to make more impact
persuasion-wise than the established
media and the reason is credibility
people just don't believe established
media anymore
but do they believe
tim poole
pretty much
right do they believe
joe rogan yep
if they watched uh james altoshure's
stuff he does he doesn't do the
political stuff so much but do they
believe him yeah yeah totally credible
how about jordan peterson
if they watch him
you know do something
yeah totally credible
so the independent voices are becoming
more and more
credible their platforms are getting
bigger and bigger and the the
established media is going down now like
i said the fox news is clearly an
exception
fox news is still a powerhouse and i
would argue getting stronger i mean now
with uh gutfeld you know managing
to basically dominate the
you know the evening hours as well
they really have a pretty good
stranglehold on on the top spot there
all right
this is interesting you saw with am
radio started with a crutch for the left
but conservative shows ended up
dominating
anomalous says
interesting
all right so
um
have you have you noticed that depending
on what side you're on you'll decide
that
if there are a few bad apples in the
barrel
that either the whole barrel is bad
or is not
it just depends what team you're on
so if you're on team apple
and it's proven that a few of your
apples are bad
you're gonna say well it's just a few
apples
the rest of us are great don't judge us
by those few bad apples
but if you're on the other team you say
well look at the bad apples in that
bunch over there
so of course none of these arguments
about
entire groups being bad or good are even
a little bit legitimate
right and i'm gonna i'm gonna say the
same thing about um
black lives matter
so the way that black lives matter was
being
looked at by the right is very similar
to how the january 6th thing is being
looked at by the left
which is if you were to look at let's
say the the entire group of black lives
matter protesters
what percentage of the total protesters
were literally doing a crime
i actually don't know
but it's not more than ten percent is it
i don't think it's more than ten percent
so see those of you who have the big i'm
seeing some bigger estimates on locals
if you have a bigger estimate like 25
some people are guessing that
you think that 25 of the black lives
matter protesters were actually
uh committing actual crimes 25
i don't think it's even close to that
i mean i don't know has anybody ever
measured it well let's and then let's
take the same question and apply it to
the january 6. what percentage
what percentage of them on january 6 do
you think we're
really wanting to do an insurrection and
really actually do some damage
less than one percent maybe
maybe
yeah so
so at what point we should have some
kind of a standard
uh yes i was on joe rogan somebody asked
me
um
we should have a standard of how many
bad apples there are before the bunch is
bad
and so i asked and i was just wondering
how people would feel about that so i
asked the a poll question i said what
percentage of a group needs to be bad
in order for you to judge the entire
group
um by the few
so
uh one percent of the
people said that if nine percent of them
were bad
no i'm sorry
not nine percent of the respondents said
if even one percent of them are bad
they're all bad
does that seem extreme to you
so so nine percent of the people
answering said if even one percent are
bad you can judge the group
uh twelve percent said only five percent
is bad you can judge the group
27 said if 10 of them are bad you can
judge the group
and over half said if 20 are bad you can
judge the group so f2 if more than 20
are bad i
you know
i would say you could judge the group at
the lower numbers then it's just more of
a judgment
more of a judgment
so it doesn't look like we could even
agree on how many bad apples it takes to
spoil the whole bunch
so maybe we can't have any standard for
that but certainly twenty percent
i would say one percent would be a good
standard what do you think
what what do you think if we said if if
if fewer than one percent are the
problem
then we can say the group is fine
would you agree with that do you think
that more than one percent of the
january six people
had uh let's say violent intentions
i don't know
i mean maybe if the one percent did the
others got caught up and that's
something too
yeah they're probably more more feds
than one percent
somebody says um
so i just put that question out there i
think we have to deal with this because
otherwise we end up
debating absurdities in public
i think it's absurd to say that january
6 was an insurrection or not an
insurrection
it's just absurd
what it was is a whole bunch of people
who were not doing an insurrection
with some number that we don't know
who totally probably wanted an
insurrection so how can you talk about
that as one event
wouldn't it be more accurate to talk
about it as two events that happened at
the same time
one event was a whole bunch of people
protesting who genuinely thought they
were fixing the system
meaning they thought the system had
given them a bad result
and that the system would be stronger
and more credible if they just took a
pause
and made sure that they got the result
that they wanted to get well made sure
that they had an accurate result
don't you think no you think at least 90
percent had only that in mind to get the
right answer
and then
10 or maybe one percent
had much worse ideas
all right
um chris christie
uh said this about january 6th so he's
going a little bit hard while he's going
hard at trump he said january 6 was a
riot that was incited by donald trump in
an effort to intimidate
mike pence and the congress into doing
exactly what he said in his own words
last week
overturned the election
he wanted the election to be overturned
meaning trump did
now
what do you think about that
let's say christie was right
let's say just hypothetically
let's say his character is
his characterization of what trump did
is exactly the way he explained it
and i'm going to read it again but i
want to ask this question first
why would we assume this is bad
okay why would you assume it's bad i'll
read it again and ask yourself why do
you assume that's bad
that uh
trump was doing exactly
what uh christie said inciting a riot
to intimidate mike pence in the congress
into doing into overturning the election
why is that bad
why is it bad
i'm just looking at your answers
all right here's why
here's the problem with this statement
there's a gigantic assumption here
that's unstated
and if you don't if you don't state the
gigantic assumption
i don't know what to think about it
and the gigantic assumption was about
whether the election was
valid or not
and whether you could tell just by
looking at it
if the election
was completely valid
then yeah what chris christie is saying
looks pretty bad
especially if trump knew it was valid in
that case it really is an insurrection
and it's all bad
but what if trump
genuinely believed
that something bad that happened to the
republic
and what if he thought he was fixing it
what if he thought he was fixing a
problem not creating one
well that's different
now he could be wrong or he could be
right about whether there's a problem
and whether he can fix it that way
but you would you would think completely
different of someone who
incited a riot to save the republic
because that's not ruled out
we have not ruled out the possibility
that everybody all thought they were
saving the republic
you would judge that a little bit
differently even if they were wrong
right even if they're wrong
because this is a group that you don't
have to worry about
you don't have to worry about them you
just have to show them that the election
was fair and then they're cool
that's the opposite
of an insurrection
the opposite of an insurrection is just
just show me that the election was cool
and we'll stop
okay here's the audit
the election was cool
and then we go oh damn
okay
that that is the opposite of an
insurrection you couldn't get you could
not be less insurrectiony
then just show us it's real and we'll go
away
that
you really can't get more peaceful than
that
i mean
that's the wrong way to say it but you
know what i mean
all right
that was the fascinating content that i
had for today
and
how many of the protesters were cops
yeah we'll never know
it was his duty to protect the republic
that's right
it's like we ignored the fact that
trump's sacred duty was to re protect
the republic
now i'm not so
i'm not so uh hypnotized
that i think trump wasn't mostly
thinking about his own interests
but the whole point of a president is
that you match the country's interests
with the presidents
they should be the same
they should be
so if the president was acting in his
own best interest while still in office
should we be surprised that that would
match the public's best interest
that shouldn't be a surprise
so we do allow presidents to act
selfishly because the system depends on
it
in other words we want a president to be
acting in a way that will get him
re-elected
or to get him or her
a legacy
right you want them to be acting with
self-interest that's how capitalism
works
yeah the whole system requires
unself-interest so that's not a problem
that the president has self-interest
if it also happened to be exactly what
was in the interest of the country and
if he believed that it was fraudulent
and i think he did
well let me ask you this how many of you
think that trump
believed it was a fraudulent election
forget about
the facts for a moment so we're not
talking about facts how many of you
think he believed it was fraudulent
yeah i'm saying almost all yeses
right
and
so
and i'd love to see people on the left
answer that question
do the people on the left
believe that he knew he lost
and he was trying to change the result
anyway
because that seems to be the biggest
difference in the assumption of how you
see this
i don't know
i always say that
given trump's personality
given everything that he knew and the
thought going into the election
given the size of his rally crowds
given the fact that he's presumably
always surrounded by supporters
so you get a you would get a a very
unrealistic view of his own popularity
because he'd be surrounded by
sick fans all the time
so
and then allegedly he's a narcissist
right
so he would want to have the best legacy
and you know it would be important to
him
how he looked and stuff
but
i think that he honestly
we can't read his mind so we don't know
but i would say that everything we know
about him suggests that he thought it
was really a fraudulent election
and if you don't know the answer to that
then you don't know how to
you don't know how to evaluate how he
acted
because the way he acted was on whatever
his assumptions were we don't know it we
know he says he thinks it
was
fraudulent
but you know he's he's he's pat he has
failed to fact check enough
in the past
that just because he says it
you know even i'm not going to believe
it just because he says it
am i right
like you you wouldn't criticize me for
that would you
that just because trump says something
is true
that doesn't make it true
right no matter how much you love the
guy
or love his policies
he has a history of let's say hyperbole
to be to be kind
but in this specific case
all evidence suggests he actually
believed it i think
i've never heard one person even on an
insider say
well think about this there's not one
insider who ever reported
that he didn't genuinely believe it
think about that
think about the number of people who've
turned on him
yeah
yeah you're just coming around right
because when you think about that think
of the number of people who have
absolutely just turned on
in public
you don't think one of those people
would have heard him say that he's just
trying to
you know take over the country or
something you know you don't think
anybody would have seen him say well i
don't know if it was fraudulent but
let's try to win anyway
somebody would have seen something like
that or at least seen it on the staff
there's not even one report
correct me if i'm wrong
i believe there is not one report of
anyone
saying that anyone on the staff
believed it was a fair election and they
still wanted to overturn it
am i right
that that is one big dog that's not
barking
because there are
there are leaks and there are turncoats
and there are whistleblowers all over
this story
there are probably more whistleblowers
on this story than maybe anything ever
that we've ever seen
and not one person has suggested
that the impulse to
pause the election and check it
was anything but sincere
think about it
not one person has even alleged that
not one person has alleged
that it was an insincere attempt
was it good for the country that's a
good argument
yeah
if you're going to argue whether it was
good or bad that it happened
it doesn't look good
it looks kind of bad to me
but you i don't think you can argue that
it was sincere
there's no way that that could have been
still a secret at this point a year
later
a year later and you don't think chris
christie just to pick one
you don't think that he would have known
for sure
for sure
that the people in the white house
believed their own story or didn't
he would know
am i right
chris christie is well enough attached
and he's clearly speaking out about uh
the president so he doesn't have any
he's not he's not uh giving you a
fear-based opinion
would you agree with that
that christie's opinion doesn't seem
that christy is afraid of anything at
this point it doesn't look like it
so if he thought that they actually were
lying about their belief about the
election he'd tell you
don't you think
now think about the fact that i'm the
first person who mentioned this to you
the the dog not barking is the one that
people forget the most well i'm that's
the whole point of it right
but the entire media coverage of this
for a year
has never once said do you notice
something missing
that not one person has suggested the
administration was insincere not one
am i wrong because i think by now one of
you would have said oh yeah there was
this one person
scott
so jessica asked this
jessica's looking for the shelley
treatment let's see if she gets it
um hold on hold on damn it stop going by
why did you support lockdowns that
forced everyone to shop at a few stores
open for less than
why did i support lockdowns jessica
what should we tell jessica
about my support for the lockdowns
does anybody want to do this for me or
would you like me to do it
jessica
you hallucinating piece of that
never happened
i never supported lockdowns
not once never came out of my voice
never wrote it never tweeted it
not once
not once
so
before you come over here and spread
libelous misinformation
once you go
check your sources
check your thinking
and come back
when you're
less useless okay
was that good enough
i know you're waiting for the c word
weren't you
but unlike some of you i treat men and
women the same with equal dignity
i do
and if a man attacks me i would use any
word i wanted to insult that man
if a woman attacks me
and again if you know if i get attacked
first
there's no word i'm not going to use
publicly or privately
if i feel like it
now i didn't feel like using this c word
with jessica she sounded like she was
just misinformed
shelley was a different subject
the the shelley critic that uh
that i went off on here
that was a more evil thing
jessica had an actual question based on
a misunderstanding
that's fair
so i didn't go i didn't go as hard as it
but i'm not going to i'm not going to
hold back because
somebody's gender
should i
how many of you are
such backward
uh backward misogynist that you think i
should treat a female troll differently
than a male troll on in public
does anybody think i should treat them
differently
if they attack me first
right
well i guess i shouldn't make a
difference
yeah no
there's no reason i should i should
treat them differently
scott will you apologize to
now jessica justin goes go on all
caps
apologize to except i couldn't read it
well i apologize to what and it went
away
apologize how long are you going to
blabber about this oh okay jessica's
being a now okay jessica i was
wrong you are just a miserable
piece of so i'm gonna get rid
of you
i thought um
oh man i just hit the wrong
i just hit the wrong button there
all right um i'm going to sign off now
and we'll talk to you tomorrow
