good morning everybody
and welcome to the Sunday edition of
coffee with Scott Adams the best thing
that's ever happened to you any day
Anytime Anyplace
and if you'd like to
bring it up to the highest level of
Awesomeness that has ever been
experienced all you need is a cup of mug
or a glass of tanker Jellison juggler
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamines for the day
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous app go
um
all right
so is it my experience alone or has the
Twitter filter just eliminated 90 of all
the tweets
because I I turned on Twitter this
morning and I think
uh
uh I follow a lot of people
and I was I'm seeing almost no tweets
did people stopped tweeting yesterday
it seems like it seems like the uh
constraints are the strongest things
have ever been
can you imagine if Elon Musk made the
following
point or it'll change to Twitter
so you can actually see what the other
side was saying
imagine that I have no idea what
Democrats are thinking you're saying
because I'm completely like locked down
to their all I see is really crazy stuff
well maybe that's all there is
so we're seeing at least one entity
maybe it's only one in the world I don't
know the beginning of a trend possibly
in which in addition to listing their
pronouns he and him for example
they're listing their uh their racial
identification
so now people are putting in their
profile uh
she them
uh part black Part White
now one of the things that makes me not
worry about stuff like this but makes
the rest of you worry more is these
things always go to the point of
Ridiculousness
like things that feel a little
ridiculous when they start but you can
see the point of it it's like okay I I
get why wokeness exists so we can all be
you know kind to each other
that's good
but it always goes too far
and and when you think it's gone too far
it's going to go further
but but it is it is self-correcting
in the long run there isn't any way that
this he him she her stuff is going to be
you know the long-term way we're going
to be there's no way that lasts because
most things don't last almost nothing
lasts
so that'll change uh but it's in the
it's in the hilarious range now now the
thing that will change it is when uh
everybody simply fluidly changes to
whatever gives them an advantage
right now if you tell me I'm not your
leader
well I think you have to examine that
claim I am your leader I have gone first
by identifying as a black female
whenever that's helpful and I will
identify as whatever gives me the most
social benefits
social or economic
and I will do that shamelessly and as
often as I need to and I will never
apologize for it because those are the
rules
if you give me a set of rules then put
me in the game
what am I going to do
am I going to say no
I will play by my own rules no I'll play
by the rules of the game and the rules
very clearly give me this option so I
take it you will too
I've ever have I ever told you that
analogies are not as useful as you think
they should be have I ever mentioned
that
I'm going to give you the best example
I've seen in a long time
so there's a professor Jeffrey Sachs
s-a-c-h-s who is tweeted by David sacks
s-a-c-k-s no relation spelled
differently
and the professor is saying what David
sack's has been saying for a while which
is that the uh the West the US and NATO
pushed Putin into war
by you know saying that NATO would be
extended into the Ukraine and Putin had
clearly said
that was crossing a line
and so the good professor says you know
he warned the administration actually
tried to talk to the administration to
talk him out of
putting NATO right on Russia's border
because that would be an aggressive act
and they would have to respond
now
the professor defended his opinion this
way
he said you know sure NATO's opinion is
that nobody can tell you who can join
your organization
by itself that would sound pretty
reasonable right no no third party
can tell anybody who can or cannot join
NATO
especially your enemy can your enemy
tell you
how to form your army that's an enemy
against them
and so
you got that but here's the analogy so
Professor sack said how would you how
would you feel in the United States if
you found out that Mexico and China had
formed a military Alliance
and my first reaction to that was Oh
shoot that's a good point if if China
and and Mexico right on our border
formed a military Alliance there's no
way we'd let that happen right
right
there's no
that would be impossible right right I
mean that would be crazy it would be
crazy for China and Mexico to form a
military Alliance except they already
 have and they've killed about a
quarter million Americans with
their military Alliance that is right in
front of us completely transparent and
nobody has any doubt about it so
Professor sax who's a smart guy by the
way but
if you're a smart guy don't use don't
use analogies this analogy proved your
own point
Russia I'm sorry China and Mexico have a
military Alliance that is successfully
killing a hundred thousand Americans a
year or we'll get up to that soon
and we don't do anything about it
are we not completely okay with it
I mean we say things but we don't do a
 thing about it do we no no we do
a little defensive stuff like a little
minor border stuff but we don't really
try that's about it
so I would say that there actually is an
argument on both sides of this
I actually I totally understand the
professors and David sacks too I
completely understand the argument
that we caused the War
by doing something that was so clearly a
red line
they have to say we're the ones who did
it on the other hand
on the other hand
who gets to tell you who your friends
are
how does Russia get to tell us who our
friends are or who have a military
alliance with why does Russia have
anything to do with that
so correct me if I'm wrong but both
sides are completely right
and they disagree but they're both right
yeah it's 100 sure that we caused the
War
and it's 100 true that we had a right to
do whatever the we wanted without
them telling who we should have an
alliance with those could both be true
does anybody disagree with either of
those I I think those are both true
now let me
criticize both uh Professor Jeffrey
Sachs and David sacks a little bit
small criticism
here's my small criticism
it doesn't matter how we got here
how we got to this place is 100
irrelevant
to what we do now and I'm not even sure
it's useful
I mean it's interesting I I would like
to know the background to it but but the
decision making
should be as if you woke up today into
this situation
so the decisions we make would be you
just woke up into this world there's no
history history doesn't exist what do
you do now
if we're still talking about what who
did what in the past
we're just not we're not being useful
yet right I mean I like that we have
some context of it that does help but it
doesn't help you do what's next
now Russia continues to Target the
Ukrainian power grid and apparently
there's some suggestion
that Engineers are advising the military
because apparently they're hitting
exactly the right parts of the energy
structure to get the the hardest to
replace parts
so what should we do at this point
well not talking to them seems like a
mistake doesn't it
am I wrong
the fact that we're not even in a
conversation about what peace would look
like that feels like a mistake
especially when nuclear weapons are
being casually discussed
if you're casually discussing nuclear
war and you're not having a conversation
and it's not like you won't pick up the
phone right
does anybody think Yeltsin won't pick up
the phone
of course he will
right he's got a problem
and the fact that we're not making any
kind of a grand offer to you know work
together and figure out a way past it it
really suggests that this is all about
getting rid of Putin and that's all
there is
now let me ask you this
if follow the money always works
follow the money always works what
happens with the Ukraine Russia
situation
where does it go
well
here's what I think
I think that the energy companies are
driving the ship
and the energy companies don't want to
compete with Russia
and so the energy companies will cause
us to continue the pressure on Russia
until something breaks
and something more breaks
so I don't see any way that this stops
as long as the energy companies could
benefit from a degraded Russia
there's just not enough emphasis to stop
it
not emphasis but energy
did I say elsin not Putin
oh did I say elsin I was thinking of
elsin while I was talking about Putin
right so correct that I was talking
about Putin
um
the the yelson reference is I'm still
wondering if Yeltsin really was
sort of in the bag for the United States
it makes me wonder how much we've been
messing with Russia and how much they've
been messing with us
knowing as you
as we all know now that our government
can completely lied to us and and do it
for years do you think that Russia has
always been the bad guy here
what do you think the United States has
always been the bad guy
because the more that the more that I
look into this the history it looks to
me like America has always been the bad
guy
now if you think I I know where this is
going I know where this is going I'm not
even going to look at the comments
within five seconds somebody will blame
me for being a Russian spy
and um in Russian and it will be in all
caps I'm not even looking but I know
it's happening somebody in all caps is
blaming me of only looking at the
Russian side
how'd I do
I don't give a about Russia like
why would I be on their side
I'm not on their side because I know
some of you are thinking right now why
is he doing you know the other dumbest
thing I saw recently
I keep waiting for the world to wake up
to why uh to why Trump was treating
Putin in public after whichever big
um so that they had where he was
treating Putin with respect and he said
that Putin said X and he had no reason
to doubt it
and then people said my God you're
siding with Russia
I didn't see that
I didn't see it at all all I saw was
that he didn't want to embarrass him in
public because he wanted to work with
him that's all I saw
yeah and it was funny because the same
people who believed that Trump lied
about everything
you know from the moment he was born
they believed that that was the one
moment you stood in front of the public
and said the truth when the situation
was such that nobody would say the truth
in that situation that was the situation
in which the truth was really not called
for
what was called for is not embarrassing
Putin maybe you can work with him
that's all and the fact that I have to
explain that
to the news media like nobody got that
nobody picked that up
I haven't even seen anybody I don't even
think
correct me if I'm wrong but even the
right-leaning media got on Trump for
what was obviously the right play
treating him with respect in public
that was the right play
um how many of you saw the
it looked like it was a Ben Shapiro
interviewing
um
Bill Moore did you see that interview
and as was pointed out to me on Twitter
Ben Shapiro did a perfect Implement
implementation of the really strategy
now I've told you the really strategy
is when somebody makes a statement that
is so ridiculous that you can't use
logic or Reason to do to debunk it you
just look at it and go
really
really
and that's and usually if the person
saying something ridiculous that's
enough to get them back off and so uh
there so Bill Maher and uh
and Ben Shapiro we're talking about
Trump and that Trump says crazy things
and Ben Shapiro's point was
why would you take as like literal truth
everything that Trump says when it's so
obvious
that there's a disconnect between the
way he managed the country and the
things he said out loud and and Bill
Maher was
sort of suggesting that he did take all
of that seriously
and that's when Ben Shapiro hit it with
a really really everything he said
really really everything he said
everything Trump said you took seriously
really and it was a wonderful moment
because you don't you don't see that
much of a
like a knockout punch
but that was just such a knockout punch
and I I don't remember how you know Bill
responded to it
but that was the moment
where the cognitive dissonance was not
just obvious but was laid out on the
table so you could see it
like really
all right we're all looking at this too
I'm looking at it you're looking at it
and you're going to claim that you took
all of that seriously all of it really
all of it
that's like the joke I was saying about
the comedian whose name you'll remind me
of that I can't remember
it was a black stand-up comedian
see this is one of the times when using
somebody's race is useful
am I wrong
if you're describing somebody
and you're trying to get somebody to
like tell you who their name is isn't it
useful to say they're ethnicity right
gender ethnicity
so I think that's fair so no it wasn't
Chappelle so it was a lesser famous
comedian not one of the name brands as
well as some I hadn't heard of before
and he was saying uh
you know you don't want to you don't
want to believe in conspiracy theories
right nobody wants to believe in
conspiracy theories but are you telling
me that the government of the United
States has got a perfect record
you tell me you think that they they're
batting a thousand percent on no
conspiracy theories and when he says it
that way it's just so hilarious because
you realize it would be ridiculous to
imagine that they don't
you know they don't try to play one on a
regular basis
all right enough about that
um
you know one of the great things about
problems in this country
is sometimes we can word them away
we can just use words to make problems
go away you've seen it right you think
you have a real problem but then you use
words and it just goes away with words
and I don't think there's anything
that's luckier
than the fact that most of the crime in
the United States
which normally you would consider this a
problem would you
crime right normally that'd be a big
problem but it turns out that high crime
is the most associated with uh Democrat
Mayors but Republican governors
problem solved
everybody's getting what they wanted
right
if high crime is associated with both
Democrat Mayors and Republican Governors
and I know that to be true because my
television told me
everybody's getting what they want
I don't think we have a problem anymore
do we
problem solved all right
um
funniest story of the day might not be
true
this might not be true but can we all
agree to treat it like it is because
it'll be funny
agree just we're going to suspend our
skepticism about stories that sound
exactly like this not usually true
but this time this time you're going to
pretend this is true here's the story
there's a Georgia Tick Tock user and who
could be more credible
am I right if you were going to say I
want somebody who I can really believe
it would be a Georgia Tech talk user
so credible Source says two men
discovered they were both fathers to a
young girl when they came to pick her up
from school where she works uh
uh where she works uh I don't know how
that would make sense
so anyway both men came in to sign out
their daughter from school and when when
one saw the other one signing out what
he thought was his daughter he said what
the hell are you doing
you can't sign out my daughter from
school you'd have to be on the list
so the school showed him the list and
they were both on it the mother
who apparently didn't live with either
one or maybe she lived with one I don't
know but the mother somehow had run
for years the idea that they were both
the father of the same girl
now
that's pretty good
would you like to hear a story in my own
life
that mirror this or at least I was
suggested by it anybody
one day in my 20s early 20s
there was a co-worker of mine who was a
very attractive young woman and I said
to myself I would sure like that get
with that attractive young woman
and it turns out she was a tennis player
and I was a tennis player and so I used
that as my end and I said hey you want
to play tennis
on the weekend and she said yes
and we made a date
so I show up to the tennis court at
three point in time pretty excited
because she was really attractive
and she doesn't show up
and I'm looking at my watch and I'm like
oh crap it was you know too good to be
true you know there's things that are
too good to be true
because it's like
you know she was like a little bit out
of my out of my buying power if you know
what I mean like clearly she should have
been dating somebody
better than me
if I could be humble for a moment
and so she doesn't show up
so of course I'm not surprised right but
I'm in my tennis clothes I was ready to
get some exercise and there was another
guy there who's who was hanging out
waiting for his tennis partner so I said
and I wanted to I want to like keep my
claim on the one of the courts so I said
hey you know my partner didn't show up
um looks like yours didn't show up you
want to hit so he's like sure
so we start playing and turns out our
games were sort of well-matched so it
was really fun you know not everybody is
fun to play tennis with but he kept the
ball in play and he was a good guy and
he was funny and you know we were handed
off have a good time
and then my date shows up
and I'm like ugh I got I got a little
warm up in I got some tennis and then my
date shows up this is going to be a
great night for me and I'm thinking
and then the date looks at the two of us
and she goes oh I see you met each other
well it was sort of downhill from that
point downhill from that point
yes she literally
made a day with both of us
she made a date with both of us at the
same place to do the same thing
so it gets weirder from here
right
so we started playing tennis and we
realized it was it was really fun even
though it was three of us who were
playing you know Canadian doubles it was
really fun because she was actually a
really good tennis player too
and we had a great time went out to
dinner the three of us
yeah at this point I think I'm not sure
if uh if the other gentleman still
thought he had a shot
but I don't know but and we ended up
being friends
so we turned we ended up playing tennis
I don't know maybe a few dozen times and
we'd always do the same thing we'd eat
some Chinese food and stuff now there's
a punch line
because otherwise I'd feel really bad
about this story
she finally came out as a lesbian and
married a
woman that she loved and lived a happy
life
so
so I I got the last laugh
it was a happy ending if you think about
it it was happy ending
that's one of my favorite stories
I love that story
all right today's Vibe is uh I'm not
Nicole you're an occult you're in the
Trump cult or you're in the Democrat
cult but damn it if there's one thing I
know for sure
you're an occult
you're in a cult
um
and so I thought well what is the
definition of a cult I've looked at this
before but I never really noticed that
nobody has the same definition of a cult
try looking up the definition of a cult
they're all over the place right it's
almost like they're not even talking
about exactly the same thing it's almost
like the word doesn't have a one it's
like it doesn't have one definition that
we can all agree on but let's agree
let's figure out who's in The Cult
Democrats or the GOP so I'll read you
some of these definitions they're
different ones and see which one you'd
say sounds more like a cult
a group that is focused on a living
leader
to whom the members seem to display
excessive jealous unquestioned
commitment
the group is preoccupied with bringing
in new members and the group is
preoccupied with making money
now with that describe the Trump Maga
people
well they do have a zealous commitment I
wouldn't call unquestioned that's kind
of extreme uh commitment to Trump
so that's pretty close at least the
commitment to a living leader
um
and the group is preoccupied with
bringing in new members not really
not really
I don't really see Republicans
recruiting do you
not really they just say their own
opinions
and the group is preoccupied with making
money not really
not really so I don't think the Trump
cult fits on two out of three they just
have a living leader that people like
but that's not unusual
how about this here's another definition
from the internet which knows all things
the common characteristics of a cult
that emerged between members
is a higher level of Education
so does that sound like Democrats or
Republicans a higher level of Education
a little more like Democrats doesn't it
right uh weaker spiritual background
who has a weaker spiritual background
Democrats the Republicans Democrats
higher financial success
who has higher financial success
Democrats or Republicans
I don't know the answer to that actually
because I think it depends
kind of depends
yeah
that would I don't know
um younger age so Cults are generally
associated with the young
who's younger Republicans Or democrats
Democrats
um
there's something about time constraints
that doesn't make sense
so
question number one
if we compare the Democrats and the
Republicans
which ones believe more things that are
not true go
who believes more things that are not
true Republicans Or democrats
foreign
what do you think the Democrats would
say if I asked them so most of my
audiences probably leans right what do
you think they would say
pretty sure they say Republicans
pretty sure they would
are they wrong
I I don't know if you added up the
number of things that are not true
that both sides believe in I don't know
to me it looks like a toss-up
so here's one of the advantages of not
voting
since I don't vote
I'm not a Republican I'm not a Democrat
so so I have less chance of being you
know biased by team play because I don't
identify with those when I look at it my
somewhat less biased
is that it looks like both groups
believe a whole bunch of things that are
not true
now I'm not going to argue what those
things are
because I will stipulate that both sides
think that they're right so that's not
my argument today I'm just saying that
from my perspective it looks like both
sides believe things a lot of things
that are not true
but we we'd have to fight over it if I
get into any details
so I think both sides fit the cult uh
definition in that way that they believe
things that are not true
the Democrats don't have a leader
do they
who who do you say is the Democrat
leader because it's not really Biden is
it not really it's not AOC it's not
Biden it's not really Obama not anymore
Satan good guess
Pelosi Schumer
I guess Pelosi
yeah I guess so
but Pelosi doesn't have nearly as uh
let's say an enthusiastic following As
Trump does right he's got that going for
him so somehow the Democrats have
managed to make
enthusiastic followers of bad things
so they've actually they've actually
made it look like a bad thing
it's a funny meme go by uh
stop making me laugh when I'm trying to
hold the thought on the on the locals
platform
they can send images through the
comments and they they're sending memes
through every now and then that
just throw me all right
all right I don't know who's gonna call
it doesn't matter
could you tell that there wasn't much
news happening today
did anything happen today
so the uh I saw some polls that say the
the race is tightening so at this point
we can't tell
who's going to win the Senate right
is the worst Personnel is is the
let's say you had a choice of these two
things
you had a choice of Republicans sweeping
everything let's say by the time Trump
or a republican becomes president
let's say that there was a possibility
that we could have Republican Senate
in-house and presidency
is that better than a split government
would you be happier if both the houses
were Republican or would you be happier
if they were split
you know I think that unless one side
has a
filibuster proof majority is still split
right
aren't we still split as long as you
can't get a two-thirds majority for
anything important
for all practical purposes it's still
split even if there's a majority all the
way through right
yeah so I guess we'll have split
government no matter what
I took two long plane rides somebody's
questioning me that when I said I
traveled more during the pandemic than
any time in my life
the the two longest trips of my life
where Greece and Bora Bora
yeah I think they were the two longest
trips and they're both during the
pandemic
so if you were to add all of the miles
traveled on uh just those two trips
those I think they would add up to more
than the miles I've ever traveled in any
non-pandemic era because I don't do long
trips I've done one long Europe trip
that before that that was about it
why why are people so obsessed
with proving me wrong
it feels like people have
almost like
like some kind of a rage thirst
to show that I was wrong on a fact or
that I said something that wasn't
exactly true well what drives that
because because watching it happen
like I I feel like it's a cry for help
of some some kind I don't know what it
is because it feels like maybe I said
something in another domain
that you thought
you know hurt your world view so you've
got to damage my worldview or my
credibility to keep your worldview
intact is it something like that
I saw a theory that the belief in trolls
in the olden days
might be memory of uh
Neanderthals
and that there might have been a time
when there were you know humanoid
looking things that thought they thought
that neanderthals were trolls or like
Monsters or something
I always wonder what that was like being
around when there were neanderthals and
and non-neanderthals
all right well
ladies and gentlemen
um I Heard a statistic yesterday that I
saw once and never saw repeated so give
me a fact check on this
I saw a estimate that Europe has already
got 90 percent of what it needs for the
gas to get through the winter
in other words they've done a really
good job of you know Panic hoarding so
because
in reference to that
in a reference to any other number have
you ever seen
like that
because if the answer is that they have
half as much as they need
that's big trouble
if they have 90 of what they need then
there's a good chance that they can get
to closer to 100.
uh just there and it's not true and it's
not close and you're just in the UK in
Germany how would you know though
but being there how would being there
tell you the answer to that question
you still need a source
what was your Source just talking to
people
government data
people know
so I'm wondering why our news source is
so quiet about that
is is the news quiet about it because
they are just bad at their jobs
can you think of a more important
statistic
the most important statistics for the
future would be how much are we spending
on the Ukraine war
right it's going to be the expense
you know death and casualties of course
obviously
and that is going to be how much uh how
much energy Europe has to get through
the winter
are those not the important things and
where's the reporting so usually you
have reporting that says you don't have
the numbers
right the most important thing is how
much energy Europe has
if you're trying to game out what the
next year looks like it's like the most
important thing and there's no reporting
on it the reporting is oh it could be a
big problem
but shouldn't there be reporting like
you know we're halfway there or 90 or
maybe we don't know there should be
reporting even if we don't know
right
that would be the reporting the
reporting would be we don't know what it
is if it's 50 we're dead if it's 90 we
can make it work but we don't know which
one it is where is that
does isn't this one of the see your
instinct is that it's just terrible
reporting but it feels like more than
that doesn't it it feels like
the let's say the CIA or intelligence
agencies or the government have asked
the news people not to report on it
that's what it feels like it feels like
they're under some kind of a lid
maybe for National Security
for example if Russia knew
that um we that Europe could be 90 of
its needs if Russia knew that they might
try harder to make it worse
if they don't know they might think that
they've done enough and then they don't
have to do more
and and if we reported that things are
fine and there's enough storage well
maybe they would know where the storage
is and how it's getting there and maybe
that's a problem
but it doesn't look like we have
anything like honest reporting now along
those same lines
as my doctors on Twitter remind me
that if you've got a lot of student
loans and debt
and the only way you can make a living
after all those years of medical school
is Staff your medical license you don't
really have an option of speaking out
against the consensus
so when I've been asking the question
you know how could no doctors speak out
if they were seeing something that they
needed to speak out about how could it
be that no doctors are speaking and I
and I still take that position by the
way it is still my position
that even with extreme Financial
penalties
the the types of people in this country
are so varied there would be somebody
who would do it and lots of them and
lots of them not as a percentage
but lots of them as a number because
remember if one percent of doctors
turned just one percent
that would be like a hundred thousand
doctors
you don't think we notice a hundred
thousand doctors saying something is
true that we thought wasn't true
right so there's no world that I live in
where you can get a hundred percent of
anybody to do anything
I don't live in any world like that
so if you tell me that you got 100 of
doctors because they're afraid in this
very specific way which I do agree
I do agree that you could get to 99
percent
if you said Scott don't you think 99 of
people would just shut up yes
yes I do but one percent is a hundred
thousand doctors we wouldn't not notice
a hundred thousand doctors
would we
I suppose if they didn't go on social
media we wouldn't notice
so
that doesn't mean I'm right by the way
so this is one of those opinions where
uh if it turns out that 100 of doctors
didn't want to talk about it
and somehow we could prove that
I would be willing to say
yeah I would be willing to say I was
wrong
but I don't live in a world where 100 of
people do anything
what if you found out the number is
increasing now I would expect that I
would expect the number to increase now
because we're we're past the biggest
sensorious part so we're entering a part
where our freedom of speech is going to
be trickling back a little bit so I
would expect more more doctors to speak
out just naturally
the news is not talking about protests
in Paris that's true
I don't know about the protests in Paris
I don't know about that
the Rogue doctors are speaking out on
alternative media but only a few of them
it's like a handful it's the same
doctors all the time
you know I'd expect ten thousand to a
hundred thousand if the problem were see
remember the claim here
the claim is not that doctors have a
suspicion right the claim is they're
looking at the same data that everybody
else is looking at and saying hey
this data clearly says
opposite of why you've been told
isn't that the claim
that everybody's looking at the same
data but some people are not willing to
say what they see with the data
no I don't believe that but that's the
claim
we spent 270 million a year for yeah why
is Afghanistan cheap compared to Ukraine
a whole different level of fighting the
entire force that we had in Afghanistan
was kind of tiny
uh they would lose their lives
who's their lives and I don't know about
that
what about the Trump tapes with Bob
Woodward what about them
what about him
anyway I'm tired of talking about
pandemic stuff let's talk about anything
else
all right
um
reframes
how am I feeling
um
you know here's a question for you
we always talk about
um you know whether people are happy or
not and that somehow you should be happy
even if the things are going wrong
is there not a legitimate point in a
person's life
oh 79 000 nurses got fired for not
getting the job no that doesn't no I
would not count nurses
and doctors in the same category
at all I I'm the doctors I would want to
be looking at the data
the nurses I don't know if they were
looking at the data I think the nurses
were probably doing the same thing the
public was doing which was saying we're
not confident
we're not confident enough for this big
of a risk
you don't need any data for that you
could just say I don't know the
situation looks sketchy to me and I
think that that was a reasonable take
have I ever said that
have I ever said that directly
would that surprise you
let me say it directly
those who did not get vaccinated
I'm not going to say I agree with you
but I'm not going to say you're wrong
are you okay with that
because I wouldn't know
I I think it's
you implied it no I never well
here's what I tried to do
I tried to apply imply that people were
not using reason to make the decision
which I still believe
so I don't believe that the decisions
were made on reason
so I stand by that because people don't
make decisions based on reasons I don't
you don't people don't
right so everybody was you know dealing
with their feelings basically yeah what
scares you the most what makes you feel
comfortable in my case it was based on
my feelings about wanting to take a trip
that basically is what pushed me over
the line and
was I afraid that the vaccination itself
might have side effects well not afraid
but it was you know on the list of
things to think about
the needed data had not been collected
that's true
Will trump choose MTG as vp'd now
yeah I was more afraid of not having a
great time in Bora Bora
or was it no actually it was
well I take it back I think the first
I got it to go to Greece yeah Greece was
the first trip that's why I got the
vaccinations I think
am I remembering that backwards I think
Greece was the first gen
shake the Box
all right uh
uh well I would say that
um I would still rank myself as
depressed
now that I have a better idea what that
feels like but don't you think some
people should not be happy
am I wrong about that
are some people in uh legitimately in a
bad situation and there's no reason to
be happy about it
I mean if you're in an iron lung
and you're depressed about it is that
should you seek help
or are you just being realistic
I'll tell you I'll tell you what it was
that got me
you know how we all live in a a bubble
of subjective reality right
we walk around in a little bubble
because we would go insane if we didn't
so you put a little protective bubble
around you and you you tell yourself a
bunch of that isn't true
some of the that you tell
yourself is that you can trust everybody
that you think you can trust
if you didn't tell yourself that you
couldn't live in the world
you couldn't live in a world where you
trusted nobody but what is closer to the
truth you can trust everybody that you
think you can trust or that you can
trust nobody which of those is closer to
actual reality
sadly the one that's closer to actual
reality usually once you get out of
family connections you know as soon as
you're out of the family your blood
connection because I do trust my family
members
completely 100 percent
but because my family members would do
the right thing if nobody was watching
I don't know are you lucky enough to
have family members like that
I I could say with a hundred percent
certainty
that my siblings would do the right
thing in almost any situation
when nobody was watching I can say that
with certainty
but I can't say that about just about
anybody else
there are people I suspect would
right like yeah I have a friend who
uh if you if you ask me to bet on it I
would bet he would do the right thing
every time in the in if nobody was
watching
but I don't know I don't know I mean I'm
pretty sure
so here's what happened to me in the
past years yeah I'd say a little past
year or something
that um that matrix-like mask
kind of fell off
and I lost my illusion for a while
so being depressed is not about being in
the wrong state of mind which is the
problem
in my case being depressed was in being
in the right State of Mind
that's the up part
the part that made me depressed is when
I saw things clearly
and I worked since then
to rebuild my illusions
so when you ask me if I'm feeling better
or depressed I'm uh I'm I'm sort of in
the process of rebuilding an illusion
that I can live in without pain
and I'm not quite there yet
because
that I
I can still see too much ugly
and I can't live happily in a world with
this much ugly around me
I don't be physically ugly I mean you
have ugly ideas and thoughts and stuff
and I'm trying as hard as I can
to rebuild a uh like a protective
imaginary Shield of everything's fine
when it isn't it definitely isn't but
you know you have to build up a little
wall of imaginary protection so I'm
building up a little wall of imaginary
protection as as efficiently as I can
but it's hard work
all right
but uh and then physically I haven't
figured out how to
fix my physical problem so exercise
I don't know if I'll ever be able to
exercise again so let me give you let me
just give you an idea
it's possible
that I will never have another
um personal relationship
for the rest of my life it's possible
that I'll never exercise again for the
rest of my life
because that's my current physical
situation now it could be that I can
work through those things and everything
will be fine I mean I could be better by
next week but the length of time it's
been and the fact that I don't even have
a clue of what's wrong and I'm at that
certain age where things will fall apart
suggest that I could be at the end of my
life
and on top of that feeling physically
that I'm literally at the end of my life
um the the responsibility that one has
at a certain level of life is that all
of my daily decisions
have to do with my lifespan now
like if I if I thought I would get
another dog
I think ah dog lives 15 years I
don't know I don't like those odds
because I wouldn't want to get a dog
that you know outlived me
so so it's it's really
you know until you get to a certain age
if you're younger and you're listening
to this there are some real
psychological
challenges you have to get past now I
think it's probably easier if you've got
a big family situation because then your
family is your whole situation that's
probably a whole different deal
but
um let me also tell you that I have a
sort of at least a one-year minimum
minimum optimism buffer so my one-year
optimism buffer works like this
if it looks impossible
I still give myself a year
that's that's like a rule it's like a
system rule doesn't matter what the
problem is doesn't matter how much it
hurts doesn't matter how much I want it
to stop
I'll give myself one year to just fix
that thing
so you know don't worry I'm gonna check
out early because I've got a year to fix
this
but I can tell you if I felt like this
in a year I would look to kill myself
so let me let me say it directly if I
feel like this next year
I'm going to look to kill myself
because I don't want to live like this
like I'm not I'm not going to do this
another I'm not going to do this two
years
I'll do this one year I'll give you one
year with this amount of pain and then
next I'm not gonna do two tears
promise you I would do too now that
doesn't mean I'll kill myself
it could just you know go on different
drugs right but you know legal illegal
whatever I have to do heroin I would
definitely do heroin
ended now
somebody's suggesting that I kill myself
right away thank you appreciate it
no nothing's going to happen in the next
year
so don't don't worry about me waking up
tomorrow nothing's going to happen in
the next year for sure
fentanyl no that'd be one way to go
yeah
but by the way if I do it
don't feel bad for me okay
because it'll be me getting what I want
shouldn't happen
although I always thought I'd get
murdered before then
honestly
you know I have seen my death
and it does involve murder
now that one I might be wrong about
because it doesn't feel like my other
visions of my future but so it's the
only one I've ever seen you know the
only death I've ever seen in my future
is me getting murdered
for doing something that I wasn't
responsible for
uh by Rando usually not by somebody I
know
like some for political reasons I don't
mean for Crime reasons I mean for
political reasons
but I don't think that's likely
all right
um
Scott can a news bubble be defined as
propaganda yes I would say so because
the news bubbles are created for the
purpose of
you know persuading one one group so
yeah
is there anything happening in the News
That's happier than this
um
about
what
yeah the the other thing that
um
moved to a small town and associate with
people well see here's the problem
when the when the Matrix mask fell off
associating with other people just
turned out to be really unpleasant
I think I could get over that
it seems temporary
but it just seems really unpleasant at
the moment
so I've been avoiding uh just people in
general
I will challenge your assumption of what
you said about who I trust
uh I would never trust a spouse
that's just me
would any of you trust a spouse
because 2022.
no you know it wasn't
um what caused the mass to fall off was
not uh related specifically to the
marriage yeah
it was bigger than that
you know how many how many of you could
say the following thing
I've been curious about this
I'm convinced that nobody knows me
like actually nobody
because there's nobody who knows the
whole story
everybody gets a slice
and the slice that they don't see it's
not necessarily because I'm hiding it
maybe it's just never been exposed or
whatever
um
but I don't think anybody knows me how
many of you could say that about
yourselves
would do you is there anybody who
doesn't have anybody who knows them
so that's a common that's a common
feeling isn't it yes a lot of people are
saying the same thing
sort of weird
oh you have a twin that helps
does your twin know you I want I guess
maybe better than anybody else
Mark Twain said we never know someone
that's true I agree with Mark Twain
by the way Mark Twain is always who I
was gunning for
um here's a
here's a little tip from my book
you know they tell you people you you
shouldn't be competitive you should
compete with yourself
you ever heard that now you don't
compete with other people you
you know compete with yourself to be
like the better version of yourself
terrible advice
terrible advice never compete with
yourself
because beating yourself is is the
lowest bar in the world
being one percent better than you were
uh wow
you should always be competing with
somebody else but here's the part I add
they don't have to know it
you should always be competing
but the person you're competing with
doesn't have to know you're competing
with them so it could be you know just
someone you know
could be a family member you know don't
be a jerk about it like don't sabotage
them or you know don't talk about
them
but just have them in your mind
you know the one to beat and I've never
I've never said this before but my one
to beat is Mark Twain
that he's my one to be because how do
you beat that right now if I were trying
to beat myself
just think about the difference right
it's like here's me here's Mark Twain
if I beat myself yay
yay one percent yay beat myself but if I
beat Mark Twain
I've done something
and if I don't beat Mark Twain and all I
do is I take a good run at it you know I
close the distance well that's better
than just beating myself
so oh you're always competing with
somebody
you so Mark Twain was my uh
my
my target
it's not a silly comparison
Mark Twain is actually a quite
accurate comparison because Mark Twain
would be considered a an American
uh writer of humor
who was also saying some things that you
know were relevant to the society
and that's what I do that's my job
now I'm not saying that I'm in his class
I'm saying that you know that's my
target
also trying to get that uh still trying
to get that Nobel Prize
but I'm not fussing
I could take science or I could take
science
economics which is you know the fake
Nobel uh uh or peace
so any one of those I'm good for I think
I've got a good I've got a good argument
for all of them
so here's how I could win the Nobel
Prize for science you ready
come up with a proof that we live in the
simulation
and I'm already developing like an angle
on that so I'm like closing in on it and
the angle is that there will it will be
something like a rule and the rule will
be there will be nothing that we see in
our so-called reality
that would not be the same constraint
that a computer would have
that those two will never be out of sync
that that that's not proof we're in the
simulation
but it would be certainly evidence
pushing you in that direction
and there might even be
some way to prove it directly I would
argue that it's already been proven that
goes like this
um
spooky action at a distance
you know and things that appear to
change the past or move faster than the
speed of light those are examples of
History
being created
on demand
once you realize that reality is created
on demand including history
not just what just happened but the
history that you know the trail that
would go all the way back
it's all created on demand once we
realized they hit that reality is
created on demand and I think we already
have it's just we haven't interpreted it
that way then it's obvious there were a
simulation
yeah the the only tense that will exist
is the present tense and everything else
and I think there's some other um
obvious proofs of that
one is that
if you keep going smaller and smaller
you know into the atomic world and the
quantum world
and you keep asking well what's that
made of
right what what's a what's a proton made
of
then maybe there's an answer to that but
then you get that answer you say what's
that made of
so once you realize that matter is
irrational
then you can do away with it
yeah the physical matter is completely
irrational
because you would have to assume that
everything about it is made of something
else or if you got to the bottom level
and everything is the same it wouldn't
move
if you put everything the same in one
place and and put no external force on
it
it would just sit there it'll just all
be the same
so you'd have to have something that was
you know some kind of difference that
would cause any movement
so it can't be true that everything is
different all the way down well that's
made of something that's made of
something else that's made of something
else to Infinity
and it can't be true that if you got to
the bottom of it it's all the same
so the only two possibilities that it's
different forever
and that is all the same
are irrational
so reality can't exist it's it's
illogical that it exists
all right
um
so I think
there might be some simple rule
and this was in my book God's debate
long ago
now I don't think this rule fits
everything but watch out cleverly and
sort of a an author way it sounds like
it might
what if there's only one rule in the in
the whole reality and the rule is this
like things attract
and that's it
things that are alike attract
now it's one of those things where you
say well how can I explain everything
and then you go through all the examples
how about gravity
imagine two objects in space
and they would be attracted right by
gravity
but the two objects are more like each
other
than the empty space around them so the
things that are too most alike would be
drawn together now it wouldn't matter if
one was a hunk of metal
and the other was a piece of wood
the metal and the wood are more like
each other than the empty space
poop
and so
and so watch how many times you see
things that are the same are attracted
to each other and things that are
different or not
now you can say but but what about you
know
what about magnets that repel
I would say well
you know I'm pretty sure those are
things actually attracted you just
turned them around I mean if you put the
if you took two magnets in space
and they were facing each other in a way
that would repel
if they were in space
they would flip around immediately and
come together
because magnets are just like magnets
right so every every time you find an
example where you think well that's not
going to work
it you can kind of find a way it does
you can talk yourself into it now I'm
not going to claim that that is the rule
the one rule
that regulates all of physics but it
might be
it might be in other words I do believe
that there might be one rule that simple
at the bottom of everything
so so that's that's my bid for the Nobel
Prize in science
uh foreign
magnets are just like magnets
you'd rather have a mug than a Nobel
Prize I want to be like uh
who was it who didn't bother to go get
his Nobel Prize uh
the singer old rock singer uh
what's his name Bob Dylan yeah Bob Dylan
he wins the Nobel Prize for what
literature or something he's like ah
mail it to me
I I want to reach that you know that
certain confidence and age where you
could just say Nobel Prize that's cool
why don't you mail that to me they'll
look good on over my mantle
have Dilbert win him a Nobel Prize
done I will do that I will have Dilbert
win a Nobel Prize
all right
um
we got a medal of freedom too
all right everybody is there anything I
forgot to talk about today any topics
that you need to
get out of your system
it's a pretty slow news day today
all right
the Mar-A-Lago crimes could result in a
census barring Trump well I think that's
the whole game is they're trying to get
Trump
in an unelectable situation using the
legal system
but I don't know I I feel like if they
if they infinitely try to get him
something's going to get him
don't you think
like I I'd love to say that there's no
way they can get them on anything but if
you just keep pressing
you're going to get them on something
that didn't even happen
like sooner or later
somebody will believe something that
literally didn't happen and then they
got them
so
uh what Mark Twain books have I read the
main three or four
but a long time ago
all right
um and we still haven't heard anything
about uh China uh walking out the prior
leader how did you interpret that
you know if if China had been trying to
tell us that the prior leader was ill
and they were doing a befavor don't you
think they would have used a cover Story
by now
don't you think China was said oh you've
totally misinterpreted that he was
feeling bad and we just wanted to uh
and we wanted to uh
blah blah
don't publish a
well never mind
all right
I got nothing else to say so I'm gonna
go do something else and I'll talk to
you tomorrow
