well welcome to the best thing that ever
happened to you yeah it's called coffee
with scott adams
and you are lucky enough to be born at
the right time
in the right
rock in this big old universe
a lot of the universe won't be able to
watch this and i feel bad for the
universe but not for you because you're
a winner you're a winner you're smarter
than average
you're sexier
and damn it you're gonna enjoy the
simultaneous sip but first all you need
is a copper mug or a glass of tanker
chelsea's time to canteen drink a flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it do its magic now
i'm not sure
but i think i just developed complete
immunity from the omicron variant
it feels like it
i don't know
time will
tell well
how would you like me to talk about
something different for a change
yeah i hear you i hear you do you know i
want you to know that i'm as tired as
talking about the pandemic as you are so
we're only going to brush on it toward
the end but not really talking about the
pandemic so much more about psychology
let's talk about some other things my
favorite topic
is when cnn and fox news fight
i i could not be more entertained by
their little uh
their conflict
so here's a good one
i saw this in a tweet from versa sharma
and he's quoting cnn's oliver darcy and
oliver darcia cnn said quote i'll
reiterate that it's time for actual news
organizations to stop calling fox a news
network it's not it's a right-wing talk
channel that has spent the past year
misleading viewers about january 6 with
a flood of lies and conspiracies
so this actually happened
cnn actually accused fox news of
creating fake news
about the insurrection that didn't
happen
in other words the fake news
cnn is accusing another news
organization of spreading fake news
about cnn's fake news
i'm not positive can somebody help me
with the negatives of the negative
situation
but i think it all canceled out and we
got truth
because if
help me out here if it's fake news
but if there's fake news about the fake
news
could it cancel it out
and accidentally give you real news
i know that's a little optimistic
but maybe
maybe we accidentally got news
so yes
cnn's belief is that there's absolutely
no evidence no evidence of some kind of
government conspiracy
no no evidence of that having to do with
january 6.
i would like to agree with cnn
but i have to agree with them
i would also agree that there is no
what i would call confirming evidence
of fbi involvement in january 6.
does anybody want to disagree
i say there's no confirmed evidence
plenty of suspicions
right there's the rayapps thing there's
the guy with the bullhorn
there's the people taking down the fence
that you know for some reason there's
all these
unindicted
conspirators
but
i'm going to agree with cnn
that
to the best of my knowledge
there's no proven
let's say proven evidence you know make
up a term
that the fbi was involved
would you agree or no
no court has found they were involved
but here's what cnn gets wrong and they
get a very wrong criminally wrong
disastrously wrong wronger than anything
could ever be
and it goes like this
if the attorney general won't answer the
question
that representative massey asked
yeah under oath
how many fbi or actually how many
government employees were involved in
january 6.
if the government won't tell you the
answer to that
the right answer is to presume guilt
you the government doesn't have a
presumption of innocence
what are you talking about cnn has has
like the most basic thing about life
backwards
individuals have individuals citizens
are innocent until proven guilty
not governments
if the government is telling you is
hiding something
they are guilty until proven innocent
is there anybody who would disagree with
that standard
if the government says i am not going to
tell you this important information
about an important topic
is the assumption innocence
are you kidding me
no cnn the assumption is guilt
the government has to prove they're
innocent i mean if you have this many
flags
if there were no
no let's say hints or indications or
suspicions
that they had been involved that would
be different
but there are plenty plenty of
hints suggestions
concerns
very well short of anything that i would
call confirmed
you know proof
but there's a lot of it
and wherever there's a lot of it
doesn't matter if it's true
doesn't matter if it's false doesn't
matter if the public is crazy doesn't
matter how we got here
the burden of proof
is on the government they are presumed
guilty until proven innocence under
under this specific situation
that there's plenty of smoke
so you know you worry that there could
be fire and they refuse to answer the
questions
they refuse to answer the questions
under that situation
you have to assume guilt
does anybody disagree with that
is there even one person who would
disagree with that standard even one
i'll bet not
about not a single one of you disagrees
with that standard
and yes cnn
acts as if that's not the standard
because to them it's not
to them it's actually not the standard
now i am way more supportive of fox
news's approach on this
well i think they might you know the
opinion people get ahead of the facts
there's no disagreement on that right
wouldn't you agree that on fox the
opinion people get ahead of the facts
opinion people do that i mean it's
almost
it's almost kind of built into the
pundit job trying to predict right
but uh have you ever seen fox news get
ahead of the facts
and then turn out to be right
can you think of an example of that
what would be an example where fox news
was way ahead of the facts
and then turned out to be right
russia collusion
fox news reported from the jump that the
russia collusion story was
from the jump
and they were right
how many people were accusing fox news
and getting ahead of the news and being
fake news a lot right
and they were completely right
absolutely vindicated completely
vindicated
you you see uh fox news goes hard at
fouchy
right
fox news goes really hard at fouchy
in the beginning
i felt that was illegitimate
yeah i didn't
i didn't feel like attacking him
was exactly the right move in other
words it felt like the opinion people
were ahead of the facts
were they right in the end
yeah they were right
the fox news opinion were way out of the
facts on fouchy
but as we kept watching him oh they were
totally right
totally right now i don't mean about any
money connections you know that's
unproven but in terms of
uh him as a leader during this thing i
think they were completely right that
there were some credibility issues that
weren't just in the past but went
forward they predicted it right i would
say
yeah the whitmer kidnapping scandal i
don't i don't know the details but did
fox news get ahead of the news on that
um i think so
so
it's entirely legitimate to criticize
any of the news organizations for
getting ahead of the facts
but it has to be noted that some people
do a success wuhan lab there you go
was fox news all over the wuhan lab
before the data
was available
yes
yes they were all over the wuhan lab
and
they were right
what is uh what has fox news been saying
about the election security of let's say
2020.
i feel as if a lot of the fox news hosts
not all of them but some of them were
ahead of the news wouldn't you say
they were ahead of the news well we
don't know if they're ahead of the news
because the news has not matched them so
it could be that they're just wrong in
this case
it could be that this would be the time
that they got ahead of the news
and they were wrong
maybe but
you have to look at it's exactly the
same people
just just to blow your mind for a little
bit
all of those people who are
i would say rightly being criticized for
being ahead of the data
that's a fair criticism would anybody
disagree
it's not an unfair criticism to say that
opinion got ahead of the data is it
it's almost just a description of
opinion
i mean it wouldn't be opinion if the
data had confirmed it
so
how do we ignore the fact
that the very same people
who got it jesse small it there you go
there's another one fox news was way
ahead of the way ahead of the data
and they were right
right
so how many more times
do the same group of people
right because it's the same pundits as
cnn i'm sorry fox news
covington kids probably i don't know the
details in that one but how many times
do they have to be right
before
before you say well i get that they're
ahead of the data
but this is a group of people who have
been
like crazy right
not all the time
not all the time by the way so i'm not
i'm not suggesting that
fox news has a you know 95
opinion getting it right before the data
but what would you what would you say
would be the percentage
if you had to guess
that fox news just the opinion people
right you know who i'm talking about
just you know they had it he's in the
laura ingrahams and
tucker
you could add the five to that
um
do you
so i think this will your number out
here will depend on so i'm saying 70 90
70
i would have guessed
i think i would have guessed
70
which is pretty good for opinion i'm not
even sure that you'd say that's a bad
grade would you because remember opinion
is
it's fact free
it's just starting to you know sense the
facts developing
yeah i think they actually do pretty
well
fox news if you could do
if you could have 70 prediction
by opinion alone you're just reading tea
leaves and
being smart and knowing how things work
and stuff like that that would be
amazing
70
but 30 is a big problem isn't it
if the people you trusted because they
got it right on all those other things
what happens if they get a big one wrong
you know what if what if fox news was so
right
that you kind of said okay they keep
getting it right
but what if they got a big one wrong
that would be pretty dangerous wouldn't
it if it were let's say about health the
pandemic that'd be pretty dangerous so
i'll just say
be cautious about everything you listen
to on any platform
but i don't think it's fair
to say that fox news is wrong when you
have when they have a track record of
anticipating
correctly pretty well
pretty well i'd say
way better than chance
all right um
rasmussen has some polls uh some new
polls about biden
and apparently he's uh he's way in the
crapper on the economy and national
security
as so much so that rasmussen had to do
some research to find out if it was the
worst ever
but
biden's numbers are so low
the erasmus rasmussen had to go back and
check
is this the worst it's ever been in any
president ever
now it turns out it's close because i
guess uh
obama had uh some bad polls
uh on some of the same stuff but at this
point the number of americans who were
raiding uh
him poor let's say was it a half or
something like that
some gigantic number rating and poor
on
on both national security and economics
how in the world could he win an
election
doesn't it just seem
like does anybody believe he could win
an election
uh it's funny that he's pretending he's
gonna run
all right let's talk about the teachers
unions you may have heard that the
chicago teachers unions have voted by
some big majority 73 or something
to uh not go back to class
and i guess they're going to do some
remote
work action or something like that
so they're they're worried about the
coronavirus
don't want to go back to class
now
here's an interesting thing
does everybody know who max boot is
if you don't just know this
there's nobody who's more of a democrat
than max boot
if you were to look up democrat
in in the dictionary it'd be like a
little picture of max boot
by that i mean you can you can depend on
max boot
to say whatever democrats whatever their
message is just period
like here's a guy who's never going to
get off the path
he's going to be democrat message all
the way every time no doubt about it
here's another one that would be like
that joe lockhart
if you've watched him
again you don't you don't need to be you
know to know him deeply i'll just tell
you that
you've never seen joe lockhart
say anything publicly that wasn't
exactly what democrats say
like there's no amount of data or
information that's going to make joe
lockhart or max boot turn
on the narrative am i right
would you agree with would you agree
with that those guys are not going to
turn on the democrat narrative
until
until
you with their kids
and guess what happened
the teachers unions
are with our kids
and that was the limit
here's what max boot tweeted today
about the chicago teachers union's
action this is outrageous these teachers
need to teach these teachers need to
teach kids come first and there's no
real danger to the teachers as long as
they have had all three vaccine shots
that is max boo turning on a teacher's
union
why
because they with kids
that's too far
that's too far
what did joe lockhart say about max
boot's tweet he said i've supported
unions my entire life i was a member of
a union
but max boot is right these teachers are
playing politics with covid which is
damaging our children you can't
criticize the right for outrageous
behavior and then support these teachers
finally
what i tell you
was going to happen
probably pretty soon
you know you know i've said uh you know
if you get in trouble
you don't want mom to find out
you know because mom mom will punish you
if you get in trouble oh no mom found
out i broke the vase or something like
that
so you really don't want to piss off mom
but you don't want mom to call dad
right now i'm
talking about classic 50s family here i
know it doesn't apply so much in 2022
but i feel like dad just got called
on this school stuff
joe lockhart i'm just guessing i assume
joe lockhart and max spoon are probably
both dads
am i right
anyway can you confirm that i assume
they're both parents right just guessing
but
they reached their limit
now it's time for dad
so it looks like the dads
probably are the ones that are going to
have to end this
if all the women in the world
you know
form together and protested anything
they might get it
if women protest as a group you know
they can be pretty strong but if you
really need to break something
like if you just need something to just
get broken
call dad
he'll break that
uh if you need to go extreme
mom isn't the right choice
if you need to threaten violence
i'm opposed to violence so i don't
promote it but if you need the threat of
it
you got to call dad
right
and we are approaching the point
where the dads have not ruled down
violence
somebody says you clearly don't know my
mom yeah there are definitely exceptions
and i'm not i'm i'm not suggesting
violence etc but when things get
extreme
you know in terms of when the public is
extremely abused
at the point where the public is
suffering extreme abuse
we're not talking about talking anymore
right
there is an implied violence
that comes with male activity
would anybody disagree with that
just getting a lot of men involved
brings violence with it
so to the extent
that dads get interested in any topic
and i think they'll get a lot interested
in
in this whole school closing stuff
there is an implied violence
that doesn't have to be spoken
that just comes with large male activity
right
so nobody has to say it and i definitely
don't think anybody should do it like i
don't want to see any violence about
this but
we're at a new level now
and i've told you before that the public
is the only tool
for ending a pandemic or erranding these
restrictions or for getting past the
teachers unions the public is going to
have to do this by a a solid majority
something like 75 percent
do you think that we're close to a 75
majority public majority
of getting the kids back to school and
ending
and let's extend this maybe to ending
mandates but let's talk about the school
right now
i think we are
i mean if you could get max boot and joe
lockhart on the same team with the
staunchest republicans
i feel like we're pretty close okay max
has confirmed a father i thought so
um
it's time for the public
to take control
does anybody disagree with the the
concept
that we don't have to have a fight with
the government
because it's not a fight we're
ultimately we're on the same side
the government needs an assist
an assist it needs the public
to power up
which is happening
and to just break some log jams
and sometimes you got to call dad
it looks like dad got called
so i feel like something amazing and
good
could be about ready to happen
meaning that i would be really surprised
if the teachers unions don't back down
pretty quickly what do you think
do you think the teachers unions will go
ahead as if
the rest of the world doesn't matter
or do you think that turning
democrats against them
and the dads especially
do you think that'll make a difference
yeah i don't know i would bet that the
teachers unions will get enough pressure
to back down now they have some
competition over in arizona according to
corey deangelis who's who's the biggest
name in the teachers union's
conversations
by the way if you're not following corey
you need to
uh that's a requirement
if you watch me on live stream
uh one of the best people to uh to
follow is corey deangelis
uh just google him he'll pop up
anyway
uh doug ducey governor of arizona
announced that uh eligible families will
be able to take their children's
education dollars elsewhere if their
public school closes
there we go
that's how you do it
that's how you do it
you don't have to break the union
you just give them competition
because it's the last thing they want
the last thing the teachers unions want
is competition
so let's give it to them
you don't have to you don't have to
make a law to ban them
but what if we did
let me ask you this do you think that
the military should be allowed to form a
union
it's a volunteer army in the united
states do you think soldiers the marines
etc do you think that they should be
able to form a union to make demands of
their
leaders
no
no
it's not going to be a very very good
military if it's got a union no
it's an obvious exception
right
now
how many of you are pro-union by the way
just sort of in general that doesn't
mean applied to every situation but how
many of you are generally
positive about unions
historically let's say
yeah a lot of conservatives are saying
no
we got some yeses a lot of notes
so that
um
i understand the the anti-union argument
the anti-union argument is you know let
the free market work it out
but i would say historically the free
market has
too many imperfections
for that to lead to a public good
i think that the unions may have
destroyed some companies there's no
doubt about that
but uh
i do think the unions
balance power in a way that is more
productive than not
in effect the union is competition isn't
it
basically the union
forms a sort of a competition with the
owners
and i like competition
so while you might uh disagree with
unions because they they seem to
slow down i don't know what the economy
i like situations where there's a
balance of power
so i like giving employees some power
doesn't work in every every situation
though
and i would suggest that for the same
reason we don't allow
military people to unionize
we should not allow teachers to unionize
how many of you would agree
that
the military and teachers would be
categories that could not
unionize
almost complete agreement
now remember i'm pro-union
i'm pro-union
and
uh however i would i would accept as an
alternative
um more
more uh market
options
right i think the free market can produ
uh could produce
education better than the public
the public
market
but not yet
i mean if today you just said all right
you don't have to go to public school
you can
choose yourself there wouldn't be enough
structure to you know compete
but in the long run i don't think
there's any doubt that private education
would be better than public
now i don't think there's any doubt
because competition just gets you there
over time
it just would take a while
all right so
i would say we should push for making
teachers unions illegal unless we do the
governor doug ducey method of making
sure that you can take your money
elsewhere
i see a lot of talk about
the election rules and
democrats want to have a bunch of
new
new legislation about election integrity
and of course the republicans want
they're still talking about the past
elections etc
and nobody can agree on all that stuff
but here's my take
i don't consider any of our leaders
legitimate
in america
i don't consider any of our leaders
legitimate not democrats not republicans
not independents none of them are
legitimate because we don't have a
transparent election system
now i'm gonna go with the flow i'm not
i'm not gonna start a revolution
because for some reason things are
cooking along okay
you know relative to you know how they
could be
but
i refuse to consider any of our elected
leaders legitimate
because legitimate would
infer
that we knew they were elected with a
a system that worked we don't know that
we know we have a system that can't tell
us that
all we know is something goes into a
black box
or votes
and then what comes out is a politician
but we don't know what's happening
inside the black box so we can certainly
say that the the system has decided that
they're the in that job
that's true the the system did what the
system does and somebody sits in that
office and does that that work so we can
acknowledge the reality
that the system is selecting leaders but
i don't think that any of us should
consider those leaders legitimate
because we would have no way of knowing
if they had actually been elected
you actually you know
i mean just think about this
given the non-transparency and in
non-auditable nature of our elections
you can't order all of it you can just
audit some pieces of it
given that
why would anybody be legitimately
elected
so i think i'm going to start using that
kind of language
yeah i'm going to talk about people who
are allegedly elected
because i think we need to talk about
the elections the same way we talk about
people who are accused of crimes
there are alleged criminals
and we have alleged elections
we can't confirm that an election
happened
think about that
we can't even confirm if an election
happened much less who got elected
you know we're one decision away from
even knowing if the right person got
elected we don't even know if we had one
we literally don't know if we
had an election
we only know that somebody told us we
had one
we don't know what happened
and as long as that's the case they are
alleged leaders
and that's it and by the way i'll say
the same thing if there's a republican
president you know as long as the as
long as his system is not transparent
so our alleged leaders
anyway let's talk about uh
something else uh michael schellenberger
is pointing out that uh bloomberg the
publication
um has
now
accepted after being very big on green
energy so you'd expect the bloomberg
publication
to being left-leaning that it would have
a lot of green energy and
you know solar power you know the aea
kind of stuff
but as uh
michael schellenberger says in his tweet
he says but now one of the biggest
boosters of natural gas and renewables
media giant bloomberg
whose owner michael bloomberg has
directly invested in natural gas and
renewals has published an article
conceding and substantiating almost
every single point we made over the
years
now we meaning
michael schellenberger and his his group
of advocates there
and
here's what the article says it says
europe is sleepwalked into an energy
crisis that could last years
screams the headline the the article
concludes
schellenberger says the article
concludes that the crisis was years in
the making because europe is quote
shutting down coal-fired electricity
plants and increasing reliance on
renewables
so suddenly
it's all obvious in hindsight
so from the very beginning the the
michael schellenbergers and and lots of
other people lots of other people were
saying if you
replace reliable sources of energy with
unreliable sources
you might get unreliable energy
weirdly
that was disputed
you replace if you replace reliable
stuff with unreliable stuff
by its nature
is not even an opinion
like that's something that nobody would
even disagree with
is solar power
does it work at night
nobody says yes to that how about that
wind power does it work when the wind
isn't blowing
again
nobody says it does
so you have a situation where people
intentionally and aggressively
switched from reliable power to
unreliable power
knew they were doing it
and when they were done they said oh
our power is not reliable
so
um but we're at least seeing a turn in
the opinion makers the bloombergs of the
world realizing that
a lot of the green the push
was based on overtly impractical ideas
things on the surface were impractical
like just describing the plan tells you
it won't work
you know if you have a plan
that you know won't work because the not
working part is built into the
description of the plan
you really have a problem
hey let's replace our reliable energy
with unreliable energy
you did you need to debate that
because the plan is the debate
the plan is telling you it's not going
to work
let's uh
let's secure our headaches by uh
shooting ourselves in the foot
i mean you know from the plan it will
work you don't have to do research
you don't have to go too deep on that
one
all right
um
short update
on what i call the causeless anger
that people have had against me
now um i'm not even gonna talk about the
pandemic stuff i'm just gonna talk about
the the psychology and the people's
reaction to me
and i i got the best hypothesis about
what was behind it now what's really
behind it is there's you know this mass
formation psychosis thing
that people are all flipped out and
crazy and they're not thinking well
and so because i have non-binary
opinions meaning i don't map to one
extreme or the other on on pandemic
stuff
that
a lot of people assume i'm on the other
side
and then they get mad without knowing
anything about my opinions
but they're pretty sure they're mad at
me they just don't know why
and so for the last 24 hours i've been
asking people could anybody explain
just anything anything
that you disagree with
that is making you concerned
and the experiment was fascinating
because nobody could
you would think it would just be like a
straight sentence you said x
x is wrong
i hate you
nobody can do it
it was all stuff like
uh
i guess brett weinstein used a uh
allison wonderland quote
it just said that my situation was
curiouser and curiouser
to which i said
what situation
what topic
what are you talking about
and then somebody else backed him up
backed him off i don't even know what
the topic is
what are we even talking about i know
people are disappointed annoyed
turned off angry
all kinds of emotions
but literally nobody
literally nobody
can even tell me what it's about
and then i heard a a
a hypothesis today
that i feel like might be the right one
and i'm gonna run it by you
uh
see if this sounds like why people are
mad at me
um and this came from uh twitter user
metal balls
who's probably watching right now hello
metal balls
and
this explanation sounded pretty good
she said it sounds like you are shaming
people for something they wouldn't be
able to control either way
ordinary perception versus hallucination
after you intentionally ferret out these
reactions you demean people for having
them it's hard to watch
[Laughter]
how does that sound
does that sound uh
sound about right
i i feel like this you know not it's not
100 of the story
some people just disagree on facts
uh i feel like
this is true
and
you've all noticed me blaming my critics
of hallucinating right you've all seen
that
that i continually
tell my critics that are hallucinating
now here's the problem
it's literally what's happening
when i say somebody's hallucinating i'm
not that's not hyperbole
i mean actual literal hallucination
that they they have a memory or
a belief in something that just doesn't
exist in the real world
now here's the problem
what should i say
when somebody's hallucinating and it's
obvious
and i'm i'm interacting with them so
our opinions of each other are relevant
what should i say
i think the here's the problem
the problem isn't i don't think the
problem is exactly the way i'm saying it
i think the problem is it's
uncomfortable
how would you feel if somebody told you
you were hallucinating on something that
you were pretty sure you weren't
hallucinating about
how would it feel
like really shitty wouldn't it
it'd feel really bad
and wouldn't you be mad at the person
who
who called you out for hallucinating in
public
because i remember i do it in public
wouldn't you be mad
i met i imagined i would
i imagine i would if somebody said it
about me
in fact people have said it about me i
don't like it at all
yeah somebody says the problem is your
delivery
now keep in mind
that because i do this publicly
um here's a nuance that maybe not
everybody's aware of
do you know that i'm aware that i annoy
people
you know that right
do you know that i do it intentionally
how many of you know i do it
intentionally
and you know that i could modify my
approach right
it wouldn't be hard it's not like i'm
locked in
if i wanted to just be you know mr
rogers every day just say everything's
fine everything's good
i could do that it'd be easy
in fact i do that with dilbert
for 30 some years or whatever
i've published a you know a sarcastic
comic every day that doesn't seem to
make anybody mad
nobody's mad at that
because it's easy
it's very easy to be
non-provocative you know i do it
intentionally right do you know why
do you know why i do it intentionally
attention
attention's
almost there but there's like a deeper
level of insight
it's the x factor
the reason you watch me is not because
you agree with me if if all you did is
get down here and agree with me all day
long well you know maybe i could have a
show like that
but it's not one i'd be interested in
and
uh it's not what i do
so what i do is cause you
what i'm trying to do and i think
successfully unfortunately for a lot of
you what i'm trying to do is make you
uncomfortable
with your existing opinion
i'm not trying to make you
agree with me
i'm trying to make you uncomfortable
now for some people
that discover is actually a plus
like they they like
they like being knocked off their uh
their balance point just to see if they
can get back on
right and then there are other people
who just really don't like that feeling
they like the feeling of
just being confident in their opinion
and go with it
so i would i would recommend that if
you're one of the people who don't like
your existing opinion challenge this is
really the wrong content for you
but if you like to feel
challenged
and uncomfortable
that's that's what i'm trying to deliver
so i do give you opinions with attitude
the attitude
feels like insulting
my base
and i'm aware of that and i do it
intentionally
for effect
because if you're insulted you're going
to pay attention and you're going to
fight back
and that's what i want i want you to
fight back because it's the fighting
back that gets you to
wrestle with your own opinion as well as
mine by the way one of the best
advices
pieces of advice you'll ever hear
is if you want to clarify your opinion
write it down
to show to somebody else
you will be amazed
how often your opinion can't be written
down
and the reason is because it doesn't
make sense i learned this when i was
writing business cases for a big
corporation
so it'd be my job to take the the
leadership's argument
that we should do x or y and bring it
boil it down to a summary
so it could be spread to other people
and sometimes when i would go to write
down the leadership's opinion it
couldn't be done
it couldn't be written
because it didn't make sense but you
didn't really realize it until you had
it on paper you're like wait a minute
now that i'm looking at it on paper
this doesn't even make sense
and actually some projects you just have
to like stop you're like i i don't know
i don't have an argument this doesn't
even make sense so what you'll find is
that the process of making you reply to
me
which is what getting you angry does
those of you who don't just sign off but
those of you who get angry and feel like
you have to
reply are now forced to put your opinion
in a tweet
and for some of you but not all of you
the the process of writing down your
opinion and looking at it
probably has an effect on you
as in oh i just wrote down my opinion
and
that doesn't look so convincing at all
so
here's what you need to know
i don't dislike you
that's not why i do any of this
i i actually love my audience
i don't know if that ever comes through
but part of the reason that i spend so
much time doing this
is that i get a genuine joy
from the interaction
it's not it's not just about attention
it's about the interaction
i like attention there's no doubt about
that
but it's not about all that
so
should i challenge you by saying that
you're hallucinating just know this it's
not personal
it's never personal
and if it's personal it's because i want
to help you
it's because i want you to
you know wrestle with your own opinion
maybe you can improve it
do i imagine that all of my opinions are
correct
and my critics are wrong do you think i
think that
you've watched me you know talk with my
characteristic overconfidence
and i've told you directly that i pre i
i project
more confidence than i have
intentionally
because it's good technique
no i don't think i'm right all the time
but i don't i'm not even close to that
in fact my entire thesis is that the
people who think they're right can't
tell
why would i be different
but
what we can do is bash ideas against
each other until you know we all get
smarter
i think that's happening
i and and i'll say it again i believe
that my audience for these live streams
not so much for the twitter stuff
because that
that's quick takes and just making
people angry usually but for the longer
form stuff
i will say with great confidence
my characteristic overconfidence
that this is the most well informed
audience
in america
that's what i think
what do you think
i think you're the most well-informed
audience in terms of how to think about
stuff not just the data but but how to
how to grasp
grapple with it how to
how to wrestle with it
that's what i think
um so anyway metal balls good input uh i
think that is what's happening i think
the word hallucination
is real triggering
but i'm not gonna stop doing it
because i would prefer your anger
over your disinterest
if i may be honest
and i think the real problem is that
the the problem is that the truth is
shocking the truth is that we're we
hallucinate so easily all of us
be included we hallucinate so easily
that
facing that reality is really painful
i'm i sort of make people face reality
that they literally imagined something
about me
dooley says adams was mind reading when
he said rob was having fun killing big
laden and it was an apology
well
if that had been serious
and also wrong
i would apologize
but
my mind reading of what it would feel
like to shoot bin laden multiple times
uh you have to you should assume that
that was how i would have felt in the
situation
don't assume that that's mind reading
that's more just talking
you
craig says used to be entertaining
and then you stopped that's
disappointing not angrifying well i
think what you're seeing is that when
you take trump out of the headlines
that the that the news becomes less
entertaining
uh i would imagine that i'm about the
same but the news itself is just way
have you seen the ratings for the news
the news itself the ratings are through
through the floor
right just through the floor
so yeah the uh
the entertainment value of the news just
dropped when twitter was out of it all
right well let's get to something
interesting
um
i would like to give you one point
to consider about dr malone
and then we'll be done with him okay
my understanding and i'll take a fact
check on this andre spackhouse
says
this about dr malone's appearance on joe
rogan
that apparently uh dr malone claimed
that ivermectin and some
secret unknown early treatment package
that included ivermectin presumably
totally crushed
coved in utter pradesh a state in india
how many of you have heard that either
from dr malone
or not
now oh don't get ahead of me don't get
at me some of you are questioning
whether andre's backhouse is a good
source you don't have to for this
you don't have to
that i'm not going to tell you it's a
good source or a bad source that's
irrelevant
here's all i'm going to ask of you
let us put our disagreement if we have
any
about dr malone
into this one one question first fact
jacket
so we'll start by fact checking it
because we don't we don't want to make a
judgment on something you didn't say
would you is it a
is it fair to say
that dr malone said that ivor mechtin
was a uh
major cause of utter pradesh crushing
their covet
is that
it's
did he say it i'm saying less people say
you didn't say it interesting
a bunch of yeses and a bunch of no's
so the ones who say he didn't say it
did he say something on this topic
how do we not even know that
so a lot of people are saying he said it
but let's deal with that okay
uh he said he did not know why
okay
but did he say that they used an early
treatment package that
may have included ivermectin
all right well i want to give you a
little bit of insight as to why
it might be
that
it seemed like the kova deaths uh went
to zero in utter pro or one really low
in utter pradesh
uh here's a little background
information that
and here's what i suggest
find out for sure what dr malone said
about that
right
so
whatever you think he said about that
just find out for sure and if you think
that he said ivermectin or some early
treatment
worked in uttar pradesh it doesn't
matter if it was ivormectin for this
next point
simply ask yourself this
just just google a fact check
google uh uttar pradesh
u-t-t-a-r
p-r-a-d-e-s-h and then um
covid and then fact check
just google those things
now did i just tell you that the fact
checkers are always right
and the expert doctor who's the one of
the top in his field is wrong
nope
nope
he said unknown protocol all right so
let's take
let's take um
can we agree with that can we agree does
everybody agree that
dr malone referred to an unknown
protocol
that crushed covet in uttar pradesh
would everybody agree with that
i i think maybe the confusion is he may
have mentioned ivormectin and then also
mentioned that so maybe they got
conflated
all right so it doesn't matter for for
my purposes it doesn't matter what drugs
they used okay
so the the the claim is that there was
early treatment
and that that could be related to
crushing the covet
am i okay so far
all right i want i want to make sure
that my claim is compatible with what he
actually said and i'm not paraphrasing
so i think i'm on there was an early
treatment protocol we don't know the
details
but that his claim was apparently it
worked
right
okay i think we're on the same page now
so we'll take the ivermectin out of the
story because it wasn't important for
the point i'm going to make just that
there was an early treatment
here's another fact about that same
state
apparently there were many regions
within the state who had zero deaths
during the same time
not zero deaths from covet
but zero deaths
so during the time that they were taking
the
unknown early treatment protocol
they also had zero car accidents
and zero suicides
they didn't have any cancer
no murders
now these were areas that typically
would have all of these things and lots
of them
but for the exact same time that this
early protocol
was
eliminating deaths from covid
it also eliminated deaths from all other
causes
now that's that's a good protocol
that is a good protocol
because you know i'd be happy if the
early treatment protocol just
just fixed
covet
but apparently based on the data and of
uttar pradesh
it can also stop car accidents homicides
suicides
and every form of medical
morbidity
that's pretty good
so i think
not only is dr malone
right
he's a writer he's more right than
anything i've ever seen
i've never even heard of an early
treatment protocol that could stop
car accidents
but that's pretty good
so
what do you think happened here
could it be that india has a data
problem
could it be
that those areas that four months
reported zero deaths of any kind
maybe that might be behind why we think
that the
early treatment was so good so here's my
point if you look at the fact checks and
compare it to the claim i don't believe
that you will walk away from this
thinking that the claim is stronger than
the fact checks
now i'm not going to tell you it's true
i want you to do it
and i would like you not to not to have
any conversation with me about dr malone
period
until you've done this one thing
can we agree
and if it turns out that on that one
point
there was an early protocol treatment
that really worked in this uttar pradesh
region then i would say that the dr
malone's supporters are right
i would say that they're right now mike
says i'm misreading this
say more mike
because you can be right
i would like to pause now so that you
can all notice me
being less
confident you don't see it a lot
if you can notice me saying i could be
wrong
because when people are saying you're
misinterpreting it i take that very
seriously
because everybody misinterprets
everything
so somebody says watch the interview
uh why is it that you can't answer that
question but you think that if i watched
it i could
what makes you think that
if if all of you collectively who watch
the interview
can't tell me this simple statement
did dr malone
say that he believes an early treatment
protocol
lowered substantially lowered the covet
problems in that state
that's a pretty specific claim and you
can't tell me if that happened on the
video
some people say you did but others
others agree with mike that i'm
misinterpreting
can you give me just a little bit i
think you might be right by the way can
you give me just a little bit more
whoever said i misinterpreted
why is it a big deal it's a big deal
because there's one thing we can check
with enough confidence that we could say
is the doctor giving us accurate or
inaccurate information
oh somebody says dr mccullough did all
right
but that's different
but nobody can give me a reason why i'm
misinterpreting it
he disclaims like you countries are not
comparable that is correct
i've watched most of it
but if
let me i have to push back on something
if you think that my watching it
is going to help as much as you think
i think you're wrong
because we just watched all of you
watched it and you can't even agree what
you saw
i mean you're seeing that in real time
right you all watched it you don't even
know what you saw you're not even
agreeing on whether he said
that fact or not
now i know that the the third hypothesis
is that the ivermectin uh knocked down
some worms that people would have and
that would allow them their own body to
recover better so there could be some of
that in the numbers too
uh the from covid part was implied
um
scott is implying what malone said and
arguing with what he didn't say well
that's what i'm trying to avoid
but wouldn't it be easy for easy for you
to tell me
dr malone either said
early treatment
worked in uttar pradesh or he said it
might have
or you can't tell me that you all
watched it
you all think that if i watch it i can
get that answer but why couldn't you get
that answer you watched it
all right paul i'm i'm just going to
get rid of you for being an
like we all we all get that i said i'd
watch it i've watched some of it i
haven't so if that's all you can hammer
on
you're not really doing anything useful
here so just go away
he said the u.s got involved didn't know
why
huh
malone said biden met with modi and the
utter pradesh info was suppressed
was this
so so he was suggesting that there might
be a conspiracy but he wasn't committing
to it right
all right
let's talk more about parasitic worms
yes
you see you specifically said he doesn't
know the protocol which doesn't matter
to me right
so that what it didn't matter to my
point
all right i'm going to end the dr malone
conversation by saying
if if you check that one claim
and you believe that he got that right
then i won't have any more problems with
dr malone
agreed
if he got this one claim right whatever
he claimed
i will go watch it by the way but
whatever he claimed if he got it right
then i will agree with you that dr
malone is an expert
and he should be listened to but would
you agree with me
that if this claim was wildly off base
then maybe you should question some of
the other things he said fair enough
let's just put it all in this one
question and walk away and then we don't
have to talk about it
and the claim was that uttar pradesh
defeated its kovid with a unknown
protocol of early treatment
i say it didn't happen
he says it did
allegedly
i don't wanna but you know i'm getting
enough pushback on what he did say
that i'm not entirely sure
but give me a video clip on just that
part and maybe you'll save me some time
but i will listen to the rest of it
honestly i don't know how anybody
listens to three hours of content on
anything
how do you listen to three hours of
talking from one guy
how do you listen to me i don't know
let's talk about placebos
um do you know why placebos work
anybody does anybody know why placebos
work
i'll bet you don't
give me some ideas do placebos work
because
we think they work
well it turns out that's a little bit
confusing i was doing a little research
this morning one of the reasons that
placebos
appear to work
and anyway this is the best part of the
show glad you waited the reason that
placebos appear to work
might be uh that you think they work
that and they didn't and one example
would be asthma if you give somebody an
asthma placebo
and ask them if it worked they'll say
yes
but if you measure their
actual
oxygen it didn't
so part of why placebos seem to work is
people say they feel better but
nothing's actually different it's just
an imagination
but there's a weirder category
where where people's body will actually
be measurably
better for example if you give somebody
a placebo
blood pressure med
it can actually lower the blood pressure
you can measure it
so
the second reason is that the brain
actually
somehow
for those things that the brain can
directly control
it just has to know what its intention
is and then it just does it
but
is that the only reason so some of it is
the brain actually corresponding to what
you think it should do
and then there's this weird weird result
that i never heard before
which is that the longer you use the
placebo the better it works
have you ever heard that before
so
if you had if you had a placebo and you
said all right we're going to give you
this placebo for i don't know blood
pressure
and everybody thought it was real
if you started measuring their blood
pressure on day one
maybe a few people would actually have
better blood pressure and you'd say well
there's that placebo effect
but allegedly
if you came back in a month
even more people
would have even better blood pressure
and if you came back a month after that
even more people would be better
so somehow a placebo
increases in power
over time
what
what
how is any of this possible
all right
let me add a hypothesis that is not
included in webmd where they tell you
what
causes oh the other the other uh
possibilities that
placebo will reduce your anxiety
so if you believe you're being helped
the lowering of your stress
response
could make you just get better because
your body would be better at healing
itself because you would reduce your
stress over your own
problem
also possible
here is my
own interpretation to add to the mix
if we are a simulation
as i expect we are
and i've told you before
that intention
appears don't know for sure but it
appears to rewrite the simulation
if you take a placebo
and you're a group of people let's say a
group of people take a placebo you could
count on some of those people to say
because people are all different and
weird
some of those people would say i don't
know if this placebo is or this pill is
going to work or not
and then they would get exactly that
result
they would say i'm not i want it to work
but i'm not confident
and then nothing happens
so there would be lots of people who
would take a pill and say i don't know i
don't know if it's gonna work would
those people have an intention of
getting better or they simply want to
get better
i would say those are people who want to
get better but they don't trust that
there's any mechanism for it to happen
and maybe they don't get better
but suppose
some of the people who took a pill
not knowing it was a placebo
had a stronger belief in it
so strong in fact that you could call it
an intention
in other words they're so certain that
they have a real pill that's really
going to help not for a good reason but
psychologically they're still certain
does it get so close to certainty that
it feels like an intention
and at that point does it actually just
change the simulation
in other words
are are people who take placebos using
the placebo as just a
let's say a technique
to change their own intentions and then
the intentions change the simulation and
the simulation just gives you back your
health
i'm not going to say that's what's
happening
i'm going to say that it would explain
everything we see
which doesn't mean it's true
but as a filter for explaining the world
you should take the one that explains
everything and predicts
so
that would explain every part of the
placebos
that you're just
making it happen
because that's how things work you want
to get weirder
here's my
hypothesis with no no science behind it
right this is just a
speculation
i've never quite bought into
the mechanism for evolution
meaning that uh
that it's just chance and mutation and
time
and that things that are more more
adaptive are more likely to
survive there might be some of that
going on
but
i really am based on everything that i
see about how intentions appear to
actually just change reality
would you suspect that if a giraffe
could not reach the leaves that are
higher up on the tree
that its intention which would be very
clear
to reach the leaves at the top of the
tree
but they can't
it's not like the the neck is going to
grow in real time right we don't have
that capability
could that giraffe
by its intention alone
intention alone very clear want to reach
higher leaves
could that translate into the child
in other words
could it change which child
the giraffe has
could that child then
on average have a longer deck
now there's no
there's no scientific mechanism for this
i'm quite aware of that right
uh
epigenetics means that you're trying to
do the thing
and the the attempt move to the next
generation
uh but that i think epigen genetics give
me give me a science lesson here fact
check me i think the idea for that is
let's say if your father
lifted a lot of objects and had big
muscles
that the child would more likely have
big muscles which i don't believe has
any evidence to support it right
am i right on that so far
but that's not what i'm talking about
i'm talking about a pure mental process
in which
intending something
translates into which which children get
born
now again i want to say as clearly as
possible there's no evidence for that
none whatsoever
but
if we are a simulation for which the
argument is very strong
if we are a simulation
it does suggest that intentions can
change things
and that maybe that's behind placebos
it's just an intention play
could be
anyway
uh lamarcism yeah all those things are
not what i'm talking about
epigenetics epigenetics and
uh
lamarckism are not what i'm talking
about
right
definitely not talking about those
things but apparently you will uh most
of you will just say i'm talking about
those things and then we'll that'll be
the end of it
i know i can't win this as soon as
you're reminded of something else
then your brain goes there and you're
done
so hitler's parents wanted well no i'm
not suggesting it works for every person
in every situation i'm suggesting that
it would be a statistical difference
over time
all right
and that
is what i want to say except that
if you extended this to its
natural conclusion
and this is a twitter user gf odor
that is either g fodor or a girlfriend
odor
g-f-o-d-o-r
i hope it's his last name or something i
don't i hope his girlfriend doesn't have
odor
but anyway he uh tweets uh he's got a
theory he says a clinical trial might
show that
if you're a trump supporter
ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine would
work
because of the placebo effect
what do you think of that
do you think that if you did a trial of
trump supporters versus
non-trump supporters you'd find that the
trump supporters actually did get value
from ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
possibly the placebo but you would find
that the democrats would not
because they would be sure they wouldn't
work
that could actually be tested i mean i
don't know if it's ethical or anything
but
but you couldn't test it right
why
robert's asking why don't masks work
robert we're so done with masks
so done with masks
yes so
could it be let me take you further you
want to get weirder do you remember that
dr z zelenko
had the zelenko protocol
and he was saying that he was curing
people with
hydroxy and some other drugs in combo
what if he was
what if he was
what if the doctor's confidence because
he projected himself with great
confidence what if his confidence
actually convinced his
customers in a way that other
uh other patients were not convinced by
their doctors what if the doctor
convinced them it was going to work
simply because he had that like doctor
confidence
do you think this
is i'm sorry zelinski
uh i'll take the correction
it's uh dr zelensky i pronounced his
name wrong
do you think that dr zolonski could make
hydroxychloroquine work for his patients
but not for other people
yes
that's the weird thing
i'm not saying that's what happened
i'm not saying that that's what happened
i'm saying it's actually possible you
could have a charismatic doctor who
could cure people with placebos
in fact i imagine which doctors did that
all the time right they just convinced
people that they were fixed and then
they felt
better yeah so
uh it would be easy for me to imagine
that there's a world in which ivermectin
and hydroxychloroquine totally work
but only for people who think it will
remember the placebo effect isn't small
the placebo effect could be anywhere
from 15 percent
to way for it
70
the placebo effect is so big potentially
in any given situation is potentially so
big
that if if the people who believed these
drugs would work
took them
it would it would look exactly like it
was a wonder drug
so the weird situation is that we can't
rule out
is that ivermectin and hydroxyclean
hydroxychloroquine
both work
and also don't work
that's entirely possible
that they completely
you know that they work so well
that they they might make a gigantic
difference in mortality
and not have any medical efficacy
whatsoever
that's completely possible
somebody says vaccines but that i think
you would catch that in the data a
little bit faster
you may have an indica sativa imbalance
causing random thoughts
no i don't need anything to have random
thoughts
um
if we're in a simulation we won't be
able to create a simulation like the one
we're residing i'll tell you i have a
hypothesis
that if we are a simulation there is a
way to know it
and the way to know it is that over time
there are more and more hints until you
realize you're in the simulation and
then you wake up
um or the game's over
can the opposite be true that if you
told people it wouldn't work that it
wouldn't work yes actually the opposite
has been tested so you you can make
people sicker with a uh
placebo or healthier depending on what
they believe will do that actually has
been tested
all right uh yeah we're not going to
talk about masks anymore
the the thing with masks is uh there was
a time when that conversation made sense
but not now
now the only conversation it asks is
what time is it
have two weeks passed
in two weeks
everything's going to be different
maybe worse
maybe better but any conversation about
the details in the next two weeks is a
waste of time because the the whole
pandemic landscape is going to be
completely different in two weeks by the
way scott gottlieb said that um and he's
been a pretty he's been a pretty
straight shooter on the cove and stuff
and he's basically saying it looks like
uh omicron will blow through in two
weeks
so february 1 is looking pretty strong
as a time for the public
to exert its pressure on its government
and say
now's the time
now's the time to drop the mandates
uh is scott gottlieb behind the curtain
uh i would guess so
i would guess so i don't know for sure
but i would guess so
star painter says you are my placebo
well allow me to be all of your placebo
um and by the way
this is real
do you know i tell you every day that
the simultaneous sip is making your
antibodies stronger
that's not for nothing
statistically speaking
i would i would place a very strong bet
that for the regular listeners your
antibodies are stronger than the average
would anybody take that bet
would anybody take the bet
that my regular listeners have stronger
antibodies
you forget about the vaccinations but i
have stronger antibodies than the people
who don't listen
i'll bet they do
because every day they hear a message
that says that their antibodies are
getting stronger
and while you say to yourself well
that's not going to talk me into it
cartoonist on a live stream if you hear
it enough
it just becomes part of your programming
so that's why i do it so often
all right and that ladies and gentlemen
is the end of the best show you've ever
seen in your life possibly the best
experience that anybody's had anywhere
on any planet in any dimension
and i think that that's a good high
point on which to end this
i'm going to take your guidance
collectively if you don't mind
i'd like to take your advice and to turn
my attention less to this fighting about
coveted stuff and more about some things
that are fun and useful and just
anything else just anything else but i'm
personally done with masks and
stuff like that i think that in two
weeks
or so the public will take control
i never believed that we would be doomed
and i think we're going to be in good
shape the golden age starts whenever you
wanted to
and that ladies and gentlemen
is my show
