hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time
it's time for coffee with scott adams is
it the best part of the day
well there's a little bit of debate on
that
but the people on the side that say it
might not be
they're losing the debate yeah losing it
hard
everybody says so that's because the
simultaneous sip will get you going like
nothing else possibly could and all you
need to participate
well you don't need much no not much all
you need is a
copper mugger glass attacker chalice's
tie and a canteen sugar flask a vessel
of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes
everything better except for the photos
on your laptop that you left at the shop
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens right now
sublime well
i guess the big story
is about hunter's laptop we'll talk
about that in a moment we'll let a few
more people
stream on in here before we do that but
first
i've been watching a documentary
on hbo called the vow
have you heard of it it's about the uh
the the alleged occult so-called cult
i'm not sure what the definition is
i think it fits uh called uh
nexium but it's spelled weird like nxivm
nexium with keith renier
when i'm done with the whole thing i'll
do a uh
probably do some kind of a tutorial on
his technique
because he's basically hypnotized
basically
i think he probably studied hypnosis but
the interesting thing is that
he created a cult that is
borrowed off of the techniques of
scientology
and so it's basically a scientology
clone with his own
with his own flavor on it and
it is mind-boggling if you wanna if you
wanna learn
how persuaded somebody could be you have
to watch this
remember yesterday we were having the
conversation or the nate the nation was
having the conversation
about the vocabulary to use to be
non-offensive
if you're talking about somebody's lgbtq
or other orientation so i believe the
correct word
is orientation but
we live in a world where nothing's
nothing is as clean as it could be right
there's there's nothing we all agree on
so two developments on that
as there was an online conversation
about whether or not
you could have a preference for your
sexuality
and of course all the experts says you
cannot you cannot
it's not a preference it's what you're
born with
well uh if you watch the uh
the documentary the vow you're going to
see a
cult in which one leader
reprogrammed as many as 50 people's
sexuality
it's right there now as a hypnotist
uh i've been provocatively saying that
that's a thing
you're definitely born with an
orientation in other words you're you're
born with a starter set
but people don't quite realize and i
don't think i'll convince any of you
that this is true by the way i i know
i'm out there just
you know singing alone but uh people's
preferences of all types not
not just in the sexual realm but a lot
of people can be programmed
and if you watch the vow you'll see a
number of people who were
programmed out of a certain kind of
sexuality and
into an entirely different one and it
was
just programming just brainwashing and
it worked
and it worked with as many as 50
different people
that's that's not everybody in the cult
the cult was actually like 800 people i
think at one point
but uh you'll see that and then i'm
looking at
twitter this morning and i'm seeing some
people interacting on that question
about
uh whether you have preferences for
sexuality or whether they're
whether you're born with your
orientation now just to reiterate my
personal view
is that you're definitely born with an
orientation
but only people who understand hypnosis
and brainwashing at a fairly detailed
level
in other words not just somebody who
read a little bit about it but somebody
who really knew this stuff
and there aren't many of us but i would
i would bet that 100 of the people who
have my background would agree with me
don't know that but i think so
now that doesn't mean that all
hypnotists would agree
because i got into a back and forth with
a hypnotist on
a trained hypnotherapist on twitter and
we did not have the same opinion
but it was obvious from just the
exchange
that that hypnotherapist let's say
understanding of the field was far
less than my own one of the tells
is that if they have nlp in their
profile
nlp for neuro-linguistic programming
let me just say that's the least
credible
element of the entire field so if you
if you put that in there as like your
bumper sticker yeah nlp
that usually says that your your entry
level
in understanding the field so it's not
something i would brag about
because it's the least credible part of
the part of it
so here's the other part so i'm
interacting on twitter on this question
and a woman who shall
remain remain nameless she's got a
it's somebody i know who it is just by
coincidence uh
because i live in the bay area so i
happen to know who it is you don't need
to know who it is but
somebody notable uh came in and said
hey what about me my my sexuality is uh
totally
uh by preference now what do you do
when somebody says about themselves so
this is a woman who said yeah
i'm you know depending on my situation
my age
you know what's going on in my life i
might be into women
and and on another situation and another
time in my life
i might you know i might go the other
way and pointed out that there are other
people in that category
so her point is that
i think i might be extending her point a
little bit but but i think this is fair
there are probably people who are just
nailed
at birth and this is just the only way
i'm going to be
there are probably other people who are
far
less nailed down in terms of their
orientation people who are more fluid i
think that's the word she used
now i guess you could argue one argument
would be that
is her orientation her orientation is
fluid
so sometimes she's more this way
sometimes she's more that way
and i would argue that anybody who's
fluid can be reprogrammed
the people who are just you know nailed
at the extreme probably not
you know and and indeed with
reprogramming and hypnosis and
brainwashing
it's a there's a general rule that about
20 of the public
is highly hypnotizable and eighty
percent
can also be hypnotized but not at the
same
time and degree that you know they can
learn to relax they can learn to imagine
things better
they can work on lots of stuff the
eighty percent can
but the 20 they can actually see
something in the room that's not there
you can just say look at that elephant
and they'll say oh yeah there's an
elephant
that's only about 20 so
could you reprogram somebody's sexual
identity permanently
if they were number one fluid let's say
they started down a little bit fluid
and they were in the 20 percent that are
highly hypnotizable
and the answer is yes yes
now the other hypnotists will say and
this is the conversation i got into
yesterday on twitter
is that you can't hypnotize somebody to
do something they don't want to do
something that's deeply against their
moral
ethical or just just who they are
you can't get somebody to do something
totally counter to their personality
that they would object to
something they would object to if they
were not hypnotized you just can't get
them to do it
right now that's true completely true
and then the hypnotist was using that
argument
look you can't hypnotize somebody to do
something they don't want to do
so therefore you can't hypnotize them
into a different kind of
sexual preference in this context
and here's what those hypnotists
miss you can't make somebody do
something they don't want to do
true there's a part missing though
there's part of the context is missing
you
can cause somebody to want something
different
because people don't generally have a
resistance to changing their own mind
if they feel like they change their own
mind they might have a resistance to you
changing their mind
but do you know anybody who has a
resistance to themselves
changing their mind not really if you
woke up tomorrow and said i think i want
to
you know be a different kind of person
and move to a different country
you wouldn't say to yourself you know
scott
you can't change your mind you wouldn't
say that you'd say oh i changed my mind
i guess i want to go to another country
you'd be fine changing your own mind
as long as you felt you changed it
yourself right
so that's the the back door that's the
loophole
you can persuade people to change their
mind
without them necessarily knowing that it
was you persuading them
if you simply paired something with what
you wanted them to
like more they would eventually get that
pairing
and they would start liking that thing
they didn't like so much before
and they would think huh i guess i've
changed my mind about that thing
now i like it more than i used to like
it was that them
changing their mind on their own
it wasn't it was you setting up a
situation
that would pair two things something you
knew they liked
was something they were maybe ambivalent
about until they liked both of them
now again it's not going to work with
every person and you would need more
technique than just that pairing
might use lots of language lots of other
things
but you could you could cause somebody
to believe they had changed their mind
and then changed their behavior and
activity into a whole different person
and they would never be aware that they
had been coerced
they would simply think they made up
their own mind and that that's what
a occult would feel like the people in
the cult
don't necessarily feel like they were
brainwashed
every one of them feels like they made
up their own mind
to some extent you know there would be a
little of both i would think within a
cult
but a lot of the people would think i
wasn't brainwashed i just made up my own
mind
all right let's let's talk about
something else
ironically the only people who dropped
their masks
this week were the media industrial
complex
trying to make this hunter biden story
go away
and man they're working hard on it so
you probably know this story
allegedly hunter biden some some time
ago
dropped off three broken laptops
for repair now just so you know we're
living in a simulation
the guy who is the repair guy
for the macintosh laptops
his lat his last name is mac isaiah
so they dropped the max off with mac
i don't know what to say about that it's
just the simulation winking at us
and uh allegedly the guy
is legally blind so he can't identify
him and he
he's not quite clear of the story of how
rudy giuliani
got a copy and he thought the bidens
or somebody associated with them might
try to kill him
if they knew he had the goods so he
tried to give it away to the fbi
and the story's all all weird so
i don't know what's going on i also
don't know who drops off
three laptops and doesn't pick them up
so to say that there are things wrong
with this story
would be an understatement there's a lot
wrong with this story
now is the story confirmed
i don't know it's somewhere in that gray
area between
uh the apparently the biden campaign
has not denied the biden campaign has
not said
that the emails are allegedly found on
the laptops
are fake so wouldn't you expect that's
the first thing the biden campaign would
say
first of all those are all fake we
talked to
we talked to hunter asked him about it
and he said
i never dropped off any laptops and i
certainly
didn't write any emails of that nature
wouldn't that be the first thing you'd
say if it wasn't true
if it wasn't really his laptop i think
that's all that would matter right
you go to the biden campaign and say
look this will take you five minutes
just call hunter and say is this your
stuff
is it real has anybody
done this story about how that story
doesn't exist
because wouldn't that be the biggest
story today no the biggest story
is that nobody asked the the biden
campaign if they were real
what at the same time that the entire
country is debating whether they're real
nobody thought to ask the biden campaign
or if they did ask them i guess they're
not responding to
you know the the reality of the laptops
um so in the comments somebody's saying
that the
the story is too fantastic to be fake
it does have it has a little bit of both
qualities
it has two qualities that that point in
opposite directions
one of them is is what the commenter
just said
that there are some things that are too
weird not to be true
because if you were going to make up a
story it'd be cleaner than this
right if you were going to make it up
you'd say there's a
store owner who definitely recognized uh
hunter biden
you know and you just have a clean
little story of how it all happened
you wouldn't have all these weird
details etc
and you wouldn't need a you know blind
a blind computer repair guy who can't
remember
things it's just weird so that part
makes it seem real
but there's another part that's a little
bit too on the nose
which is that a few weeks before the
election
we find a laptop with email
that's embarrassing to a democrat isn't
that a little bit
you know you know what i'm saying and
and then there's a
photograph on it of hunter biden with a
crack pipe
in his uh mouth allegedly uh
a little bit you know a little bit too
close
right and then the the nature of the
emails is so completely damning
you say to yourself would you write an
email like that
or would you figure out a way to use a
you know an encrypted app
or maybe make a phone call so at least
it's not you know
i guess if you made a phone call you
could get intercepted too
but there's a lot about this that's a
little too
perfect don't you think at the same time
there's a whole bunch of it that's so
imperfect it couldn't possibly be false
because you just wouldn't make up a
story so ridiculous unless
the store owner is the one who's
freestyling the details
and nobody saw that coming so that that
would argue to
being fake as well but there's a bigger
story
which is how do we deal with news that
is not
guaranteed to be true what do you do
with it
and the country is really trying to
figure out how to grapple with this
because we've never been in this
situation
where the news industry can make a story
disappear
and by disappear i don't mean from every
consumer
but given the the absolute silos of
news where people on the left just will
never see fox news
never once the people on the left will
never see
breitbart they're not going to read the
judge report they're just not going to
so it doesn't matter what that
part of the world is reporting or thinks
is true it just
will never cross over so it's this
unique
situation where they can make news
disappear
for i don't know 50 percent of the
country
just make it disappear and it looks like
some version of that is going to happen
they of course need to mention stories
so they can at least say they mentioned
it
but it looks like they're going to
they're going to run for discrediting it
and it looks like the way they're going
to discredit is the washington post
was reporting today that biden did not
absolute joe biden did not
get that prosecutor in ukraine fired it
because
they were worried that he was going to
look into barisma
apparently that story according to the
washington post
is the opposite meaning that joe biden
actually
was working with the international
community and everybody wanted that
prosecutor fired because he wasn't
going hard at burisma opposite of the
story
he wasn't fired because he was going
hard at them he was fired because he was
corrupt and not going after them
one of those two stories is true
now if it hadn't if it had been any
place but ukraine
you might say to yourself well i think
maybe he wasn't corrupt
but it's ukraine where corruption is
rampant
and so i would think your first
assumption would be yeah there was
probably some corruption going on there
both in burisma and with the prosecutor
you would just assume it even if you
didn't have
a lot of information so
um somebody's telling me that drudge is
a leftist now
yeah i hear that i don't have an opinion
on that
i don't read it um
yes check out ground news as somebody is
prompting me there
ground news will show you if there's a
media blackout on the left or the right
because it lines up all the reporting
and you can you can see visually
who's who's talking about a story and
who's completely ignoring it and
it's really stark when you see it it's
called the ground
news just google um
so do you think that uh
you if you were a store owner and you
found uh hunter biden's emails would you
be afraid of being murdered
just wondering how many of you would be
afraid of being murdered
because you found some embarrassing
emails
i feel like you'd feel i would feel less
worried about getting murdered
and more worried about just being
destroyed economically
or reputationally because
what would be the point of murdering him
if the email is already
is already given to someone else once
you've given away
your material you're irrelevant to the
story
so who would kill the shop owner when he
is no longer relevant
in any way to the story because the only
party he has is you know hey did this
you know did this laptop really come to
you this way
i'm not sure that part's important
anymore what's important is
is the laptop reel and i don't know if
you need
you don't really need the store owner to
determine if the laptop is real
you know there's plenty of ways to do
that all right
let's see what else we got going here um
i love the fact that trump in a in an
interview
with newsmax he said the bidens are
quote grifters and crooks
now you know why i i love this
the reason i love this is that whenever
trump takes a takes an argument that's
used against him and then flips it
around uh
it doesn't take any magic technique to
flip around an argument
but i like when he does it when it fits
because when you look at this hunter
biden stuff and then you think of the
word grifter
it fits right you know crook is crook is
sort of a throwaway because
it's sort of just sort of generic but
doesn't it feel like the word grifter
just perfectly fits hunter biden
now i've been called a a grifter and
everybody who's
tweeted positively about president trump
has been called a grifter probably
if you have more than you know a
thousand followers
and that word i
i've always hated it because the people
using it are so proud of it does that
make sense
they're so happy about their word
grifter i got you
i got you with that word grifter that
just bothers me because they're so happy
about it doesn't bother me because the
word it just bothers me that they're
becoming happy at my expense so
when i see the president turn it around
and use it so perfectly against
the other side it makes me happy a
little bit i gotta admit
the joe biden campaign is claiming that
joe biden's calendar shows he did not
take a meeting with the
ukrainian official from
barisma now if he did take that meeting
it would complete the circuit from the
emails
saying that you know burisman wants some
access
and then hunter biden being put on the
board to provide that access
and then the proof that the the circuit
had been completed
would be that there was an actual
meeting with the vice president and the
ukrainian
because if that happened that's pretty
pretty conclusive evidence of the entire
circuit
from you know a swampy influence
to actual meeting but the biden campaign
says that meeting never happened
because it's not on the calendar how
many meetings does a senator have
that are not on the calendar well every
time they have an affair
as a senator ever having to add an
affair
i'm guessing yes i'm going to guess that
members of congress
have had affairs both male and female
probably had affairs how many of their
uh hookups with the their mistress or
their
whatever is the male word for that uh
what's the male word for a mistress
wait a minute why don't i know that word
is there no word for the male version of
a mistress
just a lover that doesn't sound right
anyway we need a new word for that
let's talk to webster i think i think
they can change language
in one day if we can get maisie uh
hirono to
to say we need that word it'll be in
webster's by the end of the day
um anyway what the hell was i talking
about
i don't remember i i i have a confession
if today's live stream seems uh
not up to my usual standard
which i think is going to be a safe
statement at the moment
it's because i was a i was up late last
night
uh i'll tell you about that i'll tell
you about that later
uh so uh yeah so
i was talking about how uh that if you
were having an affair and you were in
congress
you're not going to put it on your
calendar right so you have to assume
that there's entire categories of things
that senators do have in terms of
meetings
that are not on their calendars so it
but if you're an
unsophisticated you know viewer of news
and the biden campaign comes out and
says it's not on the calendar
look at this calendar we've got
documentation that meeting
never happened if you're unsophisticated
you might say well okay
okay that's good documentation it never
happened
then you forget to ask the question are
there any other things that don't go on
calendars
is a hundred percent of what a senator
does
does that end up on a calendar if
something had once been on a calendar
and then
deleted would we know the difference
has anybody looked at the you know the
logs of
the computer system that had the
calendar or have they just looked at
the entry to see that it doesn't exist
because i kind of want to know when that
entry went away if it went away
but anyway so at this point it looks
like the swampy nature that
the emails that i heard uh on tucker
carlson's show last night
if those emails are real and i'm
leaning toward yes my
by the way check your uh your intuition
on this
i'd be very curious in the comments
uh tell me if you believe the emails are
real
all right so this will be this will be a
good way for all of us to test
our ability to consume news and and be
uh you know sophisticated consumers of
news
um i'm gonna say i'm leaning toward real
so i'm gonna say more real than not i'm
i'm not a hundred percent on those being
real
but i'm a solid 65 percent
let's say two thirds two to one chance
they're real
uh i gave a little lag so that i can see
so i'll check your comments and see how
many of you think they're real
versus fake all right
is it my imagination or is everything
that rudy giuliani
is involved with it just has a little
extra flavor to it doesn't it
have you noticed that that whenever
there's a story
and rudy giuliani is any part of the
story
the the story is just so non-standard
there's just something about putting
rudy giuliani into the story that just
blows it up into this
whole different creature
uh so that's part of the fun too we
don't we don't exactly know how that
worked out so it looks like the story
that the democrats are going to go with
is that the dad joe biden was not aware
of what the son was doing
and therefore don't blame the dad
because the son was doing that
all right i'm looking at your comments
and almost universally
there's a few undecideds but mostly
very dominant toward people thinking
they're real
yeah the people who say a hundred
percent i i would dial that down a
little bit
you know i would dial your not dial your
100 down to
you know i'd dial that down under 90
percent if i were you
you could be right but i don't think you
could say you're 100
likely to be right it's close to that
might be
um but we'll see we'll see how our our
collective
intuitions are and i always tell you
that that it's useful it's useful to
commit
in public to what you believe will
happen and then track it
later and say okay i was sure it was
true it wasn't true
and now you can adjust your your
credulity a little bit
um all right
and and who is asking uh the ukrainian
how hard is it let me this should be
um this should be shockingly obvious
when i say it
you're ready to hear something that will
make your
it'll make you angry because
all right now maybe some of you thought
of it but this will be a good test of
media manipulation there's something
missing in the story
about hunter's laptop and the alleged
meeting between the
i guess number three person from barisma
and joe biden
that joe biden says didn't happen but
the emails indicate
were at least planned so what is missing
from the story
what is the most obvious thing that a
legitimate news entity should be able to
do
in probably less than an hour less than
an hour and wouldn't even have to leave
the house
something you could do with just a
telephone that would be a big part of
the story
that is missing from the story anybody
what is the big gigantic thing that's
missing from the story
when you hear it it's going to make you
mad here's what's the gigantic thing
missing from the laptop story
who called the ukrainian guy and asked
him if he met with joe biden
right do you think that you can't get
that guy on the phone
it's 20 20. i could probably get that
guy on the phone
like literally literally if i picked up
my phone and spent the next
hour trying to contact burisma
and then yeah i could probably contact
barisma right how hard would that be
it's a gigantic company now there might
be a language issue or whatever but
i could i'm sure i could find an english
speaker at burisma
and i would say hey this number three
guy i'm trying to get a hold of him
like to ask him a question about the
biggest story in the united states
can you get my message to him have him
call me back
because we'd like to get him on record
to tell us
if he actually had a meeting with joe
biden where is that story
do you feel it yet do you feel how
obviously missing that is in the story
because it would be one thing it would
be one thing if
if your news organization said we've
been trying to get a quote from this
ukrainian executive
he's not returning our phone calls you
know we we've tried them twice yesterday
we're still trying to get a hold of him
that's kind of what you'd expect
wouldn't you
and oh and then in the comments somebody
else is saying
that you could identify the travel if
that guy traveled
there'd be a record of it but i think
you'd probably need warrants and law
enforcement
to know whether he traveled right i
don't think there's a way for
the news industry to find that out by
themselves correct me if i'm wrong
but i don't think a news entity can find
out if somebody traveled anywhere in the
world
is that is that public i hope not
so i don't know that the press could get
the travel information
given that there's no you know legal uh
process going on there that would
uncover that but they could certainly
call the guy
if we know his actual name we know where
he works
how in the world hard would it be to
just get him on the phone and say
hey hey did you meet with joe biden now
it's entirely possible that the guy
would say something like no comment
right and if he said no comment what
would you
conclude do people who don't have
meetings
say no comment no
you would never say no comment you would
never say no comment
you know if if uh well you would only
say no comment
if you'd had the meeting and you didn't
want somebody to have it confirmed
that's it uh
i'm seeing somebody say the hunter biden
story is fake
it's fake it might be yeah you know
if it turned out that the whole thing
that the whole thing was fake it could
turn out
that way right and by the way
i wonder how many news professionals are
watching this
this right now and just got on the phone
to burisma
because if you didn't what else are you
doing today
was there some bigger story today well
why don't you call bharisma see if you
can find this guy
get a comment on the record um
and i think that he would have trouble
uh
the executive would have trouble lying
because
it's not impossible that at some point
somebody else could confirm
whether he traveled you know it might be
either we find his travel records or
there's just somebody else who was a
witness
who knows he traveled so
[Music]
i don't know if he'd want to lie in
public so notably
when uh when the truth could be found
all right here's a here's a follow-up
for you on masks
every time i bring up the the question
of masks
and we don't know for sure how well they
work or in what cases they work
but i've stated that as a risk
management proposition
it probably is worth wearing them
because
to me my common sense to the extent that
that exists
tells me that they probably work not
every time
you know not perfectly but probably make
a difference
now people say to me scott scott scott
um scott scott scotty
don't you know that if you fart
that fart will go right through your
pants
so if a fart will go through your pants
like it doesn't even exist
how could you expect these tiny viruses
that can't be much
bigger than a fart particle uh
how can you expect that a mask is gonna
change is gonna stop them
so it's the fart defense i've seen it
quite a bit
here is my counter to the fart defense
and it goes like this put on your mask
hold a lighted candle in front of you
now
blow out the candle without taking off
your mask
if you can do it if you can blow out the
candle
without taking off your mask then i'm
going to say
huh you got me i will accept
the candle blowing thing as well as the
fart defense
because if the air if the air just goes
right through the mask
and blows out that candle even if it
just stops a little bit of it
that's not enough i would admit in the
under that situation
that probably these masks are not doing
much good but
if you are unable to blow on a candle
right in front of your mouth
when your mask is on i would i would
propose
that if you had been talking to a human
being that the amount of
air coming out of your mouth which is
the carrier for the water particles
which is the carrier for the virus that
there would be a
direct flow of virus from your mouth
into the facial area of the other person
who was not wearing a mask
if you're not wearing one if you put on
the mask and you cannot blow out a
candle that's right in front of you
no matter how hard you try it probably
means that the air is coming out the
sides or other places
now is it true that the air doesn't go
somewhere and just stay there
but the moment it reaches the room it
permeates and fills the entire room
with the same amount of virus in every
part of the room
well maybe i suppose if you stayed in a
room long enough
with one person and it was a small
enough room and you talked long enough
it wouldn't matter where the air was
coming out of the mask or what direction
eventually you would fill the whole room
with your aerosoled
virus but that's not how most
interactions work
mostly our interactions are brief and
then
away so if you can stop all of the air
that would blow out a candle
from going directly into the face and
mouth and eyes of the person you're
talking to
and go out the side instead i have to
feel
that the odds are that's buying you
something
so if you get the the fart
the fart mask argument that would be the
counter
the counter is the blunt the candle
argument and there you go
uh somebody says i know what i'm trying
later
you're gonna try to fart a candle out if
you can do that without blowing up your
your home give it a try um
all right so uh i was gonna do a little
experiment today
in which i open up cnn on my phone
and then i see how many of the stories
are fake
in order and and by the way i haven't
done this
experiment so i'm just going to go to
cnn
i'm going to go to the home page and i'm
going to see
how many of these stories appear to be
actually real stories oh there's
breaking news
uh kamala harris travel halted after
two associates with campaign test
positive
for covet 19. huh
but that of course would be people who
i wonder joe biden's campaign is halting
the travel of his running mate
so probably it's only the running mate
kamala harris oh my goodness
if if 2020 serves up
well let me put it this way if
if kamala harris's staff
is spreading the coronavirus around and
they're all wearing masks
what does that do to the story because
the biggest
knock on trump is that he is careless
with his mask
and then he got the coronavirus what
happens if
if the people wearing the masks
also get the coronavirus if you were
logical and rational it should mean
nothing at all
because there are people with masks who
get chronovirus there are people without
mass who get it
because we know that the masks are not a
hundred percent protection
so it shouldn't mean anything if you
were being rational you'd say no this
isn't
a controlled study this is just some
anecdotes of people who got the
infection just the way you'd expect it
to happen
but the way our mind will process this
is that it matters
even though we shouldn't and you're
going to start feeling
hey people with masks get the get the
virus people without masks get the virus
maybe trump isn't so wrong after all
maybe um i think
trump's play on this is quite quite
brilliant
because i think he can wear people down
on the notion that we're over masked
now that may not be true and it may be
dangerous
to have that feeling but i feel like he
can actually persuade that
because we remember i was talking
earlier it's easier to persuade somebody
into something they want to believe
do you want to believe that you could
take your mask off
and you'd be okay you do
you do this is a real real important
point
okay you know if if somebody is primed
to want to believe anything you can
persuade them pretty easily
if somebody's really primed against it
know you're gonna have to
work for a long time to to get any
movement on
on that person but we all want to be
told there's some
fake because i call it a fake reason i
don't i don't need a real reason
just give me a fake reason and i'll be
fine with the fake reason because i
already want to do the thing
i just want you to give me a reason and
trump is doing that
you know by by example so i would not
count out his ability to persuade
although health professionals might tell
you
it's going to get us all killed um
so this kamala harris business
that's going to be interesting i don't
know if that's true or not but i assume
is true
then there's something about chris cuomo
responding
there's an analysis that trump argues
that the pandemic is over
to avoid accountability that's a
headline
do you think it's true that trump has
argued that the pandemic is over
all right so that's the headline on cnn
trump argues pandemic is over
if i were to click into this story do
you think i would find a quote
from trump to suggest the pandemic is
over
no that's not the story
i don't even have to look at it
obama's cia director says we wear
trump's criticism as a badge of honor
okay that's just propaganda here's an
opinion piece
how paranoia in presidential politics
went mainstream
what that's just a weird opinion uh then
there's
trump needs this pivotal county uh to
win pennsylvania that's of nothing
uh oh this analysis another
massive this is in quotes massive trump
conspiracy
theory totally fizzles out and
the story is about the unmasking so
because there will be no charges filed
uh no charges filed on the unmasking
situation
then that's being called a massive trump
conspiracy theory that totally fizzled
out
is that what happened do you think that
trump's
uh trump's theory which they would call
a conspiracy theory
about the unmasking being directed at
the trump campaign
do you think that that conspiracy theory
is eliminated
by the fact that no charges are filed
no this is fake news the fact that no
charges were filed
means no laws were broken in a way that
anybody could get a conviction that's
completely different
from saying it was okay these are not
related concepts
except you know by coincidence but you
could
certainly have all the badness in the
world but it didn't technically break a
law
i was talking about that yesterday
everybody involved in
whatever this this coup attempt was to
get rid of trump
the people are all lawyers it's a whole
bunch of lawyers
probably knowing exactly what they can
and cannot do
and so they just they just made sure
that they did things that weren't
technically illegal
they were just kind of swampy
uh hunter biden-like there's something
about pete buddha judge
appearing on fox i don't know what that
story is um
twitter suspends fake accounts of people
pretending to be blacks
trump supporters that's an old story um
and then more fact checking on the
president
and something about q because that's uh
uh because q embarrasses the republicans
so they have that story all right i feel
like all of our stories are conspiracy
theories
or who has coronavirus the entire news
industry has
has been reduced to two questions who
has coronavirus
and uh conspiracy theories that's it
that's all we got
um yeah all right
so that's what we got for today it looks
like the uh the trump
strategy of dominating the news with
this hunter biden thing
is working now remember the president
doesn't
doesn't need to completely sell the
hunter biden story to win
he's got two ways to win one way is if
you believe
everything about the hunter laptop story
you believe that the dad was involved or
could have been
or should have stopped it or anything
like that then trump wins
if you if you buy into the story the way
it's presented
but suppose you don't suppose you're
you're a die-hard democrat and you've
decided it either doesn't matter
or it's false trump still wins
because every minute that is spent
talking about this story
is a minute that's not being spent
talking about something that would be
bad for trump
so by controlling our focus and it looks
like there might be
a continual drip of new emails
i don't think it's an accident that on
day one we didn't get everything
everything that could be gotten out of
the the emails
i think you're gonna see some more
emails probably some more
uh embarrassing pictures uh come out of
that
so it's gonna be pretty ugly uh and it's
totally working for trump now does it
work well enough to get him elected when
these polls
are absolutely saying that he won't
um scott can you predict a late october
surprise
well what do we have a little less than
three weeks before election
three weeks is a long time
the odds of us not having another
surprise
one way or the other the odds of that
not happening seem
vanishingly small the only question will
be whether it will be natural
or manufactured
because what we've learned is that the
left can manufacture
a rumor and it will be completely
covered by the press
but if the right manufactures a rumor
it won't be covered so there is an
advantage for the left
to come up with a good juicy impossible
to verify
rumor about trump right around two weeks
before election
where there might be a few people left
who haven't made up their mind that
could be
could be influenced so i would say yes
something's happening
and that is all i have to talk about
today
so i will talk to you tomorrow
all right periscope is off talking to
you
youtube viewers only the slaughter meter
i tell you that
um i was ready to move the slaughter
meter to 25 percent
yesterday but this uh and
i would have done it on the strength of
trump not performing on health care
there is still nothing that you can
identify as a trump
healthcare plan or republican plan let's
say
that would be the uh immediate
replacement
for what whatever is in obamacare that
they want to get rid of
if the supreme court goes ahead and gets
rid of it
so i'm going to say this as directly as
i can
if trump loses the election and it turns
out that
health care was the the big topic that
made the difference i'm going to say
that was a fair election
i would not argue one minute
against the public kicking trump out of
office
for not giving us a health care plan
that's the obvious replacement
now i don't believe the democrats
criticism
that the republicans would get rid of
obamacare
and at the same time they would just not
replace it with anything and people
would just lose their health care and
you know they they wouldn't they'd have
a pre
they'd have conditions which
pre-existing conditions and they can't
get health care
i think the odds of that worst case
scenario are pretty close to zero
it's about as close to zero as anything
is in in politics
but if people are afraid of it it's real
the fear is real
even if the the actuality is not
so here's here's how i'll feel
somebody was asking me how bad i would
feel if trump lost the election
and i'll tell you if he loses the
election because of the media
and and the only reason is that the fake
news was believed to be real news
i think i'd be pretty upset about that
because i feel like
i lived in a broken country and they and
that
lies were the determinant of who was the
president
but if i can be convinced that people
voted against trump and for biden
primarily because of concerns for health
care which would include
anything coronavirus related i would
call that a fair result
and also deserved in other words trump
has
created a situation completely knowingly
that uh one of the the top
uh the top concerns in the country
healthcare
he's just sort of letting it dangle so
that's on him
and there's no forgiveness for that
i do acknowledge that he's done a number
of things which are good for the
competitive situation with health care
very good things and i won't take those
away from them
but on the whole he's leaving the
country and
and the seniors out there just dangling
you know
if you're a senior citizen and uh
you know maybe you're not worried about
losing your health care but
anybody who's who's got some risk of
losing health care
you should probably vote for biden
honestly yeah
if i had concern about losing my health
care
i probably would vote for biden i
probably would
because that would be a big enough topic
all right
um so if the president doesn't fix that
in the next
little less than three weeks i i would
say that he deserves to lose
because that's such a an obvious
high priority topic that just hasn't
been handled
the way it should be handled so i would
say he deserves to lose
if it's over healthcare that's my
opinion
and i will talk to you tomorrow
you
