the crop top bar
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization and also a
highlight of your life so far now no
matter how exciting your life has been
it could always be better and let me
tell you how to take it up a notch all
you need is a copper mug or a glass to
Tinker cellist eye on a canteen yoga
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
I'd like to add a new sponsor to the
show
um Dylan Mulvaney Dylan come on over
here
okay how many thought he was actually in
the room she sorry
how many thought that Dylan
she was in the room
you believed it for a moment didn't you
yeah for a moment you thought I thought
maybe it's possible but no no
and I apologize for the Miss pronoun
pronoun
but I insist
that in return for my trying to use the
right pronouns
when possible
that you forgive me when I use the wrong
ones accidentally that's got to be the
deal
that has to be the deal
I'll do my best
but you gotta You Gotta Give me a pass
when I miss one
all right speaking you have uh Dylan
Mulvaney
do you think it's true that Dylan is the
spokesperson for Budweiser Light
because as was just pointed out to me
uh I haven't seen Budweiser say anything
about it
was it April Fools
do we know for sure if it was April
fools are real
because because there's no like uh
there's a boycott effort going on
so some say it's real but others are
saying April Fools
we actually don't know do we
isn't that interesting that we don't Fox
is reporting it real
somebody says
but would they know I mean could they be
wrong
so Budweiser as Budweiser even confirmed
it
has anybody seen Buzz Budweiser say yes
this is our new advertising
Bud Light partners
but I wonder if the story was wrong
all right I'm gonna say uh there's a
question mark next to the story but
we're going to treat it like it's true I
mean it's in the news
um
two signs of the time
every now and then I'd like to give you
a signpost or two to tell you where
you're at in the long Arc of human
civilization
so here are two signs of the times
number one a company sells a product
that tastes like Clydesdale piss causes
auto accidents and domestic abuse and
has as his main ingredient a slow acting
poison
so that's the sign of the time number
one
number two the public calls for a boyca
over their choice of a trans person as a
brand ambassador because that's the real
problem here
yeah the real problem is not that the
product tastes like pests it makes you
drive your car off a cliff and beat up
your mouse no
it's not it's not a problem that it's a
slow acting poison that's destroying
civilization itself the real problem the
real problem is their choice of brand
ambassadors
just putting that out there I have no
comments that's just two things that are
true
however
when you're going to pick a brand
ambassador there are lots of variables
which you must consider
variable one is this person going to
help us sell our product
and number two is there anybody who
would not buy your product
just because of the way you advertised
it
and I would say that a very very bad way
to advertise
would be to pick something that you know
will cause some people maybe a lot of
them did not buy your product
that's that's like as hard as you can
fail in the advertising world and well
I'm sure that they would like to show
themselves as a woke company
I'm not sure they made the best
advertising Choice it looked like a
social Choice better than a better than
a business choice
because I would say the first rule of
advertising is don't make an
advertisement that says not only will I
not buy your product because of that
advertisement but I'm going to organize
a boycott against you
you cannot fail
harder
than putting on a commercial that causes
social media to say boycott that's the
worst you could do there's no there's
nothing lower below that well maybe put
your whole company out of business but
you could get there
however there's one other problem that
cartoonists are highly qualified to
judge and that is
don't uh don't associate a brand
ambassador if there are too many word
play opportunities yeah people don't
think of that it's like when you name
your child
you know don't name your child something
that's easy to make fun of am I right
yeah yeah
um
so you have something you have to think
about how will people make fun of it but
as Ultra Mega Lori says on Twitter
uh no thanks to Tran
tranheiser bush
tranheiser-busch
see there's your first word play they
should have seen that coming
they should and okay
should have seen the comment
now this is why they need to hire a
cartoonist
they should say uh Scott we're thinking
of the following you know uh promotional
campaign do you see any problem with it
and I'd be like
okay so what what's your slogan
king of beers
king of beers hmm I'm seeing a problem
here
see the problem here already
because somebody's going to take beers
and replace the bee with a Q because
they're and it's going to be
the king of
um that's no good so I'd say no no you
don't want to open up this opportunity
for bigotry
and uh don't say all right so you want
to put the face of the new brand
ambassador on the on the can itself
somebody's gonna say Tran on a can
somebody's gonna say Tran on a can
that's what you have to work watch for
and sure enough they are now as a
Cartoonist I would have seen all of
these coming
and I would have you know and I would
have even seen some of the let's say
darker ones that you suggested in the
comments
yes I would have thought of those too I
wouldn't mention them I wouldn't say
them
but uh there we are
and I'm not sure that you should call
the cut the product bud
because Bud seems like
sort of
male oriented I don't know so that's uh
that's the exciting story there so John
federbin's out of the hospital and
talking about his depression
and apparently he says he's been treated
successfully so his depression is either
minimized or gone or something
but here's a question I have for you
um correct me if I'm wrong
but if somebody is treated for
depression
and they're a senator
wouldn't you want to know if their brain
has been modified by an antidepressant
is that something that the public should
not be aware of
because here's my take it's just purely
scientific this is not based on politics
there's no politics in this comment
wouldn't matter who it was
if I voted for somebody who was not on
antidepressants
I would say well that's who I voted for
you know they they presented themselves
a certain way I judged that and then I
voted for it
and then they go on antidepressants
in my opinion
that's a personality altering action
and if the personality is a big part of
what you're voting for because it's the
personality that tells you how they'll
act in the next situation right you
don't care what they've done so far
you care what they'll do next that's all
you're voting for you're not voting for
the past and the biggest Factor on how
people will act
is how they've acted before
and it's the way they've acted before
has been erased because it's now a new
brain right the brain plus a an
important modifying chemical it's kind
of a new brain and I would say that the
history of the old brain is now erased
because you can't be sure that they
would act the same way they would have
had they been depressed now I don't
think it means that they would act worse
let me be clear about that it could be
that having a depressed candidate is way
worse
than having somebody who's been treated
for it might be way worse so I'm not
saying one is worse or better
I'm saying it's such a big big variable
yeah don't worry we took your Senator
who's voting on whether we go to war or
not
and we modified the Senator's brain
but don't worry about it what
can I have some details about how you
modified the brain to the person who
will vote on the question of whether I
live or die
nah personal
that's personal
wait
how personal is that this is the brain
that is deciding if I live or die
you know collectively
ah it's none of your business
does anybody else see that this is a
problem
I feel like that should be disclosed
I feel like if if somebody goes on
a brain modifying drug
the polling should know I mean only for
your top politicians I mean I might care
less if the mayor of a city or state
legislator or something but if you're in
the federal government you're a senator
or a president yeah
I think we ought to know if a president
went on an antidepressant
you don't think that would be news
I mean useful news news you could act on
news that would change your vote Maybe
it might make you it might might make
you support them more but it would
change your vote for some people it
would change the vote
anyway here's a update on my mascot as
you know Keith olberman has been my
mascot for years and has been very
entertaining and he's done a great job
if I'm if I'm being honest he's done a
great job as my mascot but today he's
been called out for being a racist they
didn't say sexist but I think that's
implied
and what he did was he
he criticized a young woman who was a
college basketball player
and she did something mocking an
opponent on the other team and he called
around for being a effing idiot
well let me tell you if you criticize
a black woman for doing something
unprofessional or unsportsmanlike in my
mascot's opinion
you will be called a racist you should
be called also a sexist but I think they
forgot that part
and so I saw a tweet by uh Ashley Bell
Ashley is if you go by the profile
picture would be a black male who said
calling a young educated black woman an
idiot for mimicking her opponent is more
than unfortunate there's a learning
moment for you here if you choose to
take it the media of which you belong
can help end these stereotypes or push
to perpetuate them
so there you have it
using the standard which I believe is
now the standard we all accept
if somebody who is black and female
does something that you don't like and
you call out the activity just the
activity
just the mocking part then you're guilty
of being obviously a racist and I think
it goes without saying a horrible sexist
a horrible sexist and so
is saddens me to say this
I have to cancel Keith Olbermann
as my mascot because I don't want to be
associated with this blatant racism and
sexism for having one time said that
somebody's hand emotions were
inappropriate
if that's not racist I don't know what
is
can we agree would you agree that if
somebody makes a hand emotion that you
disagree with that mocks an opponent and
you criticize them but
the person who criticizes black
that's racist that's racist
all right
let's play by the rules I don't make the
rules I don't make the rules I just play
by them
so this racist sexist piece of crap who
used to be my respected mascot I'm
canceling him and so I need a new mascot
now
um and you know because of social media
people act badly and uh this is terrible
but there's a link to a story
about Keith olberman being very bad and
bad
and I I'm not claiming it's true
it's just lots of reports lots and lots
of reports
so I have an idea about ending the war
in Ukraine
does anybody like it now remember war is
often absurd
you know you could trace back the
historical reasons why a war started but
once it gets going
there's something that's purely absurd
about it after a while isn't there like
typically and
the Ukraine Russia thing is probably
more absurd than most things
number one we don't really have a good
reason to be fighting
oh there's reasons I could list them you
know you don't need to remind me what
they are I can list them but they don't
feel strong enough do they does anybody
else have that feeling it's like okay I
I get it
I understand what happened I understand
why that caused what happened and then
that caused what else happened I get it
but it doesn't feel like a good enough
reason
it just feels a little bit absurd and so
I'm going to suggest yeah you don't have
to tell me the reasons you you don't
need to remind me of the reasons I'm
aware of them I just feel like
collectively they're not
strong enough like they're clearly there
was a better way to handle this would
you agree would you agree there was a
better way to handle it on both sides
that either side could have made it go
away by acting differently I think so
somebody say no you disagree all right
but whether or not you disagree that
it's absurd
I give you my solution are you ready
so you know there's been fighting over
this Ukrainian city of bakamut
and the Russians say they control it
legally well we're legally in control
the ukrainians say well that's nicely
you're legally in control but are you
aware that our army is still there
are you aware that our army is still
there
and they I guess the ukrainians still
control some portion of macmood and the
pagosian the head of Wagner group did
tried to do a
photo shoot you know photo opportunity
where he was shown raising a flag
to show that they controlled it and the
ukrainians mocked them so you're raising
the flag over Rubble
well you got some rubble and we're still
here by the way not only do you only
control some Rubble but you didn't even
get rid of the Ukrainian Army yet that's
that's hardly a win
but here's my suggestion it looks like
Bak moot is where they're bleeding each
other
so the Russians are getting you know
bled of men and supplies and ammunition
the ukrainians are probably suffering in
a similar way I don't know who has more
of what it's hard to tell
but
here
is my suggestion for ending the war in
the most humane way you ready
is already thoroughly destroyed there's
just nothing left it's just Rubble
they seem to want to both fight over
that Rubble the ukrainians definitely
want to control that Rubble the Russians
they want that Rubble more than anybody
here's my suggestion
decide the entire War
on the battle for bakmut
just decide all right we'll do it here
whoever wins in Bak mood you get to keep
you know the parts you've already
captured and we'll we'll just call peace
right there
if Ukraine wins we'll take Crimea back
and well you know all the disputed
regions will take back if Russia wins
they get to keep all the regions that
they've already conquered but the only
place you'll fight is in Bak moot
because it's already destroyed it's
basically it's like one Battlefield that
no innocence will be killed
so here's the argument
unless the way you want to win the war
is by attacking civilians
which the Russians have done they've
attacked well they've they've attacked
more the infrastructure which directly
affects the civilians
so
oh no you say my idea is silly you say
my idea is absurd and it is
my idea is absurd
and that's the point
that's the point
imagine if we imagine if that suggestion
were raised it won't happen but imagine
if that became like a headline why don't
you just fight it out in Bak moot winner
take all
just fight it out there because here's
the thinking
whoever can win and control Bach moot is
probably going to win the whole thing
yes or no whoever if if you said we're
just going to decide on Bach moot
whoever would win that probably would
win the whole thing
not guaranteed not guaranteed there's no
guarantees in war but probably
why would you say no
why would you say no because Russia
would go after the whole infrastructure
and take down the whole country that
would be see I I think they would
but then they'd stretch their forces
right
so if Russia stretches their already
stretched forces remember they can't
even capture back moot
that's the background seems to be the
limit of their power right now if they
could capture more than that I think
you'd see a lot more action it looks
like that's all they have
and so imagine an a an absurd solution
to an absurd War
which is not crazy
it is not that the solution would work
or that it would hold what it would do
is show
hold on you haven't heard the punchline
yet
hold on
if you say my idea is so stupid
that it should not be considered then
you're understanding the idea
you are understanding the idea if you
say that's absurd it's stupid all these
reasons it's dumb it's never been done
it's unprecedented Putin would laugh
all of those things true that's why it's
a good idea
it's a persuasion idea it's not a war
idea
here's why
if you actually engaged Russia with this
idea
it would show how absurd the war itself
is
it would also highlight that there are
no better ideas
there are no better ideas
if the best idea is
I was going to swear but I'm holding
back if the if the best idea was
freaking stupid
but you also came to understand it as
the best idea
it would change how you thought about
the whole War
and it would make it harder to push the
war for Russia anyway it would make them
harder to push a war if the other side
was suggesting an absurd way to end it
absurd
believe it or not it would help
because it would clarify the absurdity
of the whole the whole Enterprise
ever happened it's just a sort of a
thought experiment so RFK Jr is uh says
out loud that he's thinking about
running for president
and I gotta say that's an interesting
Prospect
you know it would be you know what would
be good for America
just really good for America would be a
strong Republican candidate running
against RFK Jr
instead of biting
because that would be an actual contest
and I don't think that RFK Jr comes from
the crazy wing of the left
my guess is I don't know but my guess is
he's closer to a realistic Center
but he also has this weird quality that
he agrees with a lot of Republicans on
vaccinations
specifically the coveted stuff and that
that won him a lot of fans a lot of fans
on the right just for that one one uh
take
I think he earned
I think he earned his place on the
national stage what do you think
whether or not you want to vote for him
separate question but I think he earned
his place what do you say
so I would give him a lot of respect
for what he's done so far
interesting yeah you don't have to say
you drove for him but wouldn't you
prefer him over Biden let me ask you
that would you prefer RFK Junior over
Biden if that were your only choices
yes
absolutely because the one thing that
JFK Jr signals very clearly is that he's
not on the take
if there's anybody who's more clearly
signaled that he can't be bought
it's RFK Jr
nobody's ever signaled that as strongly
as he does I mean and he could be wrong
about anything but he signals it really
strongly that he can't be bought because
of the vaccination stuff if he could be
bought he would have been bought
you don't think somebody tried of course
they did of course they did apparently
he can't be bought at least not on
vaccinations
so this is a really positive
impact now let's talk about his voice
um
here's an update you might not be aware
of but he did have a procedure
to help with his voice
and I've listened to his recent
speeches and it does seem to have helped
it's not a complete fix it might it
might improve more you know as he gets
used to whatever the you know the the
medical procedure was so it might
improve might improve but it's it's
serviceable you know it works now you
can you can say things you can listen to
them you can communicate
then you can get used to it
so I'm not sure do you know that RFK Jr
he's thanked me personally for helping
him get his voice problem
fixed how many of you were aware of that
because I've mentioned it a few times
it's just it's strange to be in my
position
because you you touch so many things
that become part of History just sort of
accidentally touching them but the back
story is I I have a voice problem for
three and a half years where I couldn't
speak something called the spasmodic
dysphonia I don't know if that's why he
has but I had made some suggestions of
surgeries he could get that might help
uh he told me he looked into it you know
just by DM he told me he looked into
those surgeries decided not to get the
surgery that I got which was the surgery
in the neck that's what this scar is
um but you did a different procedure I
won't won't mention it because that's
his business but he did a different
procedure and got some benefits
and it did make a difference
so
um
isn't that weird how that could have
changed history
such so small little things
I was just trying to you know help
somebody who had a maybe a similar
problem I wasn't sure just try to help
somebody
may have changed the world
how weird that is that is so weird that
it could have changed the world
accidentally
all right
um
how would you like to talk about
Marjorie Taylor green appearing on 60
Minutes
well if you haven't seen it
I haven't seen the whole interview I'll
probably go back and watch it but I'm
going to play a clip in which Marjorie
Taylor green is challenged by 60 Minutes
Leslie Stahl on the question of calling
Democrats pedophiles
oh no
imagine being on 60 Minutes and being
like trapped on that question it's like
oh what am I going to do now I did say
those things now I have to explain why I
said those outrageous things on 60
Minutes what will I do
well let's see what Marjorie Taylor
green did
she said top like the Democrats are a
party of pedophiles
I would definitely say so they support
grooming children they are not
pedophiles why would you say that
Democrats Democrats support even Joe
Biden the president himself supports
children being sexualized and having
transgender surgeries sexualizing
children is what pedophiles do to
children
okay and things she says that are over
the top like the Democrats are a party
of pedophiles
oh no
oh no
[Laughter]
uh Marjorie Taylor green just went just
got invited into their house with a
flamethrower she just she just set their
furniture on fire
oh
okay
I am such a fan right now
I'm such a fan you know I was sort of on
the fence I was a little bit on the
fence about you know MTG
a little bit on the fence but not
anymore
oh that's so funny
let me tell you what I'm laughing about
so if the case is not obvious you may be
laughing at your own joke but so
here's
oh God
so the first we have to talk about her
Point all right so the point she made is
if the Democrats including Joe Biden are
in favor of uh
trans related let's say activities with
children
that the the trans topic this would be
Marjorie Taylor Green's opinion all
right so this is not my opinion there's
no my opinion in this just explaining
her opinion
so she's she's making the point that the
trans situation by its nature
if you put children into that
environment it's a sexualized
environment
and if you're intentionally putting
children in a sexualized environment
she's going to call you a pedophile
or a groomer
now do you accept that as a logical
argument
is that logical
a lot of people say yes all right that's
why it's funny because a lot of people
are going to say yes so to Republicans
who watch this
was it not your impression that she just
dunked on Leslie Stahl
and that her answer was sort of perfect
not not I'm not saying true
not technically true I'm not saying that
but in a political sense
in a persuasion sense
yeah I was kind of perfect now the fact
that she didn't back down she didn't
blink she didn't hesitate she didn't hum
she didn't pause she didn't say uh well
uh uh she didn't stammer she just looked
right in her eyes and said
Democrats including Joe Biden are in
favor of putting children into these
trans situations that's a pedophile
it was kind of amazing it was kind of it
was just sort of an amazing moment now
here's the part that I've been laughing
about all morning
I'm not sure if you caught this
it's not what she said
and it's not just that Leslie Stahl did
the eye roll which we'll talk about
it's that MTG by going on such a large
platform and by going right into the
belly of the Beast going right into
their living room with her fire you know
her fire thrower flamethrower
you can't ignore it now
it can't be ignored
so before it was just something that
people said on social media and you know
she said it on social media maybe in a
speech but you can ignore it
Now 60 Minutes 60 Minutes has created
this as news
before it was just stuff crazy people
were saying now it's news
and you know what is the best part of
this
for the rest of time
Democrats are going to have to answer
the question
are they pedophiles
standing ovation
[Applause]
I don't like to give too many standing
ovations because it cheapens them
but Marjorie Taylor green
just paid back democrats for the fine
people hoax
she just paid him back
how sick are you if for those of you who
have ever been let's say Trump
supporters how sick are you of having to
defend whether you're a racist just
because you're a Republican
are you tired of it are you sick of it
do you wish you had something something
you could do that would felt like
Payback
well you got it
and let me tell you I have been
completely against calling Democrats
pedophiles and groomers completely
against it
I'm completely in favor
with this argument with with mtg's
argument I would stick to that and say
hey
I wouldn't want my children around you
that's it now I'm not going to use the
uh the p word or the the G word if I'm
tweeting because on social media I think
that's too far
I don't like using those words and I
don't think it's good for your Twitter
account either I think you probably get
suppressed if you use words like that so
I'm not really in favor of using groomer
or pedo
here's what I suggest
I ran a Twitter poll highly unscientific
in which I asked my followers who of
course you know lean right
even though I don't just remind you I'm
more left-leaning but my my followers
are you know clearly conservative types
mostly
and
I asked this question on Twitter
would you be okay with the Democrat
babysitting your child
75 percent said no
25 percent were either maybe or yes
that's the right question
that's the question
that prevents you from looking absurd
because the suggestion is in the
question
right but there's more than that this is
good persuasion because it allows the
user to imagine several interpretations
if I say I wouldn't let a Democrat
babysit my kid
your first thought might be oh
because they might try to touch them or
something
or your first thought might be no
they're going to teach them woke stuff
or no they're going to teach them that
I'm a racist the parents are racist
because that actually happens that's
like a real thing
but it allows it allows people to think
of all the ways that someone can damage
your kid
it also brings it right into your house
if I say hey it looks like they're
damaging people you don't know
people you'll never meet they might be
damaging them you might care but you
won't care the way you you will if you
think it's your house that you care
about a lot so if you imagine somebody
in your house this is the persuasion
part you make it visual in the mind then
you imagine your own child even if you
don't have one you can imagine having
one
and you put that Democrat in your mind
in the same room alone with your child
and you can think of a lot of things
that could go wrong
Good Year you could think of a lot of
things that could go wrong leaving your
child with a Democrat
now of course
does anybody mind if I do a special uh
just a little notice for the stupid
people because every now and then this
is like the smartest audience in the
world
but every now and then somebody like
accidentally get over here and they'll
be a stupid person watching so this will
just be a message for the stupid people
and I'll try to I'll try to talk it in
stupid language
so you the rest of you just talk among
yourselves this will just be for the few
stupid people who wandered in here
when I say Democrats I never mean every
one of them
I never mean every one of them
when I say something about a race like
white people I do not mean every white
people I do not mean that
if I say albonians like to play chess I
don't mean every lovebodian likes to
play chess I don't mean everyone
so what would be not helpful would be
for you to tweet at me he thinks
everyone
is dangerous to children
all right that's the end of my notice
for the stupid people
I will return to
my normal persona for the rest of you
all right here's what else is funny
about the Marjorie tiller green thing
was the uh you saw the eye roll from
Leslie Stahl
I I'd play it again but I'd rather do an
impression of it myself
so after Marjory Taylor green gives a
full-throated uh support of her opinion
Leslie Stahl does
that look
what would be
what would be a reaction you would
expect from somebody who
was a very experienced news person a
person who interviews people for a
living
and is known to ask difficult questions
if somebody says something that you
disagree with in Europe you've got
Decades of experience in this exact
situation
what would you expect
you know what I would have expected
an argument against what she said
that's what I would have expected I
would have expected some kind of counter
claim well I see what you're saying but
have you considered X or I hear what
you're saying but how does that make
sense with this variable or could you
explain that more because what I thought
I heard was this
wouldn't you expect something like that
but instead it was
no
what would you call that reaction
is there a word for that reaction
is there a description of it
cognitive dissonance
it's cognitive distance it's it's not
just
one of the Tells it's the big one
it's the big one that that was the most
obvious
signal for her brain was broken
that I've ever seen in my life here's
how I interpreted it now I'm not a mind
reader right so if I talk about what
Leslie Stahl is may be thinking
can I do
um a little I have to pause again there
might still be some stupid people
watching
so uh
no I'm not going to do that
so I think that was a telephone
cognitive dissonance and here's why
I think that Leslie Stahl recognized
some connecting logic in what Marjorie
Taylor green was saying and did not want
to get involved in it
she didn't want to act she didn't want
to ask more questions because she
definitely didn't want to hear the
answers
you know what I mean because if she had
if she had gone at it factually to say
all right explain that here's why you're
wrong
do you know what it would have been it
would have been more
more of Marjorie Taylor green talking
about the sexualization of children in
the in the trans you know let's say
Arena
and Leslie Stahl wouldn't have had a
 thing to say about that
right
she would have been trapped I think she
knew she was trapped
I think Marjorie Taylor green led her
into a narrow Ravine and once she got
into that narrow Ravine and she looked
up and saw all the snipers
she thought oh
that's what it looked like to me now of
course we're all reading our own our own
experience into it right so it's
possible that the only thing she was
thinking is you crazy you crazy
and I'm sure the Democrats will uh
interpret it as her just scoffing and
dismissing her but to me that scoffing
and dismissing was because she couldn't
handle the topic
there was only one person in the room
who is capable of
of just even discussing the topic and it
wasn't Leslie Stahl she took a pass
she bowed out
she's like I'm out of the room I'm out
yeah no that was a complete win for MTG
so in summary I would not call the Dems
petos and groomers I would just say I
wouldn't let them babysit my children
and I tried that out
with a Critic of mine some critic came
at me and this morning for something and
I just replied
I wouldn't want you babysitting my
children
that's usually the end of the
conversation
and by the way
I'm quite serious about this
I wouldn't want give it given the the
Brokenness of the woke philosophy I
wouldn't want a child of mine to be
around it
I would consider that poison for their
success because the woke philosophy is a
backwards looking victim blaming
 useless uh thing that will
someday go away
whereas I would rather my child
be taught how to succeed you know how to
how to you know make it work even though
there's adversity you know how to push
through problems how to be an optimist
that's what I want them to learn I don't
want to learn that they're racist
because they're white I don't want to
learn that their pieces of crap because
they're you know they've
they like Donald Trump or something
so now I I legitimately no joke would
not want a child to be around a a
Democrat who bought into the entire
awokeness
campaign
but this brings us back to RFK Jr I've
never heard a thing he's ever said that
sounded
extra woke
so I don't know where he stands on a lot
of stuff I guess it's an open question
but he doesn't scare me at all
if if RFK Jr wanted to babysit my kid
I'd be totally okay with that totally
okay yeah I mean I would trust him
so it's not every Democrat but you get
the point
all right um
and this goes to my uh other framing
that I'm liking as days go by that woke
is a performance not an opinion has
anybody got to use that yet
where if somebody comes at them with a
woke argument you can say oh it's a very
good performance I don't I don't take
seriously any of the woke stuff that's
just performance but your performance
was excellent
good performance I wouldn't even address
the the content of it I think we should
stop addressing the content of those
complaints we should just say good
performance
because here's where we're going wrong
we we who don't like the overwokeness I
like a little bit of wokeness I like
calling people what they like to be
called for example but if you go over a
walk you're into crazy town and if
somebody's in Crazy Town and they're
just performing
for example the the person who at least
presents themselves as a black man
who called Keith olberman a racist
because he had a problem with what
somebody did with a hand gesture which
had nothing to do with race of course
uh do you think that person had a
serious point about Keith olberman being
a racist
do you think they even believed in their
own mind that they had a good point
because there was no race involved in
the story at all it could not have been
more Race Free it was the most race
uninterested story there ever was and
still this guy came up with an argument
that Keith olberman was a racist
that's performance
you see that right that was not a real
opinion that was a performance of
somebody who wanted to you know show
themselves in a certain way so
I strongly
suggest that you at least test their
performance frame instead of dealing
with any of the argument none of it just
don't deal with any of it just say
excellent performance your your wokeness
score is uh nine out of 10. good job
and just move on because you cannot take
that seriously as a topic it just can't
be taken seriously
supplement right some of it I like
but if it's the Absurd stuff
just congratulate them for the
performance move on
all right fun stuff on Twitter
I often talk about reality setting a
three-act play
the First Act is something bad usually
happens
the second act is the Fun and Games part
where you've you've worked through that
initial bad part but now you're doing
some series of things which are
interesting and funny that's what makes
the movie later there's a third act
where somebody gets into such terrible
trouble you can't even imagine how they
could get out
Twitter isn't its second act
the First Act was musk overpays for
Twitter by
24 billion dollars or whatever it was
um so that's the First Act and then he
finds out that under the hood it's just
twigs and beer and and uh and wokeness
it's just it's just like there's nothing
good in there it is just as amazing it
runs he fires 75 percent of the staff
makes you know the entire left hop and
mad right so this is all the First Act
this is just yeah the the the upheaval
so the First Act is all the bad upheaval
stuff is happening
second act
is happening now
so musk has gotten control of Twitter
he's gotten rid of sounds like a lot of
the troublemakers
he is he's got a lean
you know kind of lead machine oh yeah it
has some problems yeah maybe some
performance hiccups Etc but they get
they get worked on
and he's got some new features he's got
a subscription model that's looking
promising Etc so he's got sort of a
handle on it it's still bleeding cash
but he's he's got a little handle on it
here's the fun part
Twitter's context notes
have started reliably fact checking
the news
oh it is game on it is game on let me
tell you just a few things that have
happened recently
so first of all the New York Times
refused to get verified
which musk first of all dunks on them
because they push their own subscription
service so hard so he goes well that's
highly hypocritical given that their
entire business model depends on
subscriptions
right so if they're pushing their
subscription and they're complaining
because he has a subscription model as
if Twitter
as if Twitter is not a gigantically
useful business tool for the New York
Times
they must get a tremendous amount of
traffic from Twitter it's a business and
he wants to charge them for the the the
value they got from his business and
they're like oh no so that's the first
thing so I enjoyed that because it made
the New York Times look like idiots
basically or you know at least
inconsistent
then later musk tweets also about the
New York Times uh he goes to the real
tragedy of the New York Times is that
their propaganda isn't even interesting
look at their propaganda isn't even
interesting
I love the fact that that now that he's
got you know Twitter to to have his back
meaning that the the context notes will
be fact-checking these entities yeah
they do look like propaganda now
all right
but uh he also had a
he had he had this comment about Twitter
itself Elon Musk did he said you could
uh literally film a Walking Dead episode
unedited in downtown San Francisco this
is where San Francisco politics leads
and Twitter was exporting this
self-destructive mind virus to the world
with other with some exceptions other
tech companies are still doing so
uh
wow
wow
that's about the most truthful and
insightful tweet you're gonna see yes
Twitter was responsible for a mind virus
that destroyed a city
that actually happened
now not by itself but if you said it was
the biggest element of it I wouldn't be
surprised it might have been the biggest
element of a mind virus and I love that
he sees this as a virus the Mind virus
the wokeness and the craziness it is a
mind virus that's exactly what it is and
so he
he took over the company to remove the
virus
now that was some baller billionaire
 right there that's that's that's
some good stuff right there
but the Reuters I think it was Reuters
who did a story uh that said that Tesla
had failed to meet some Benchmark he had
given for production of vehicles
and so the Reuters tweets the story that
Tesla fell short of its goal
uh a context note is immediately
attached to it
uh yes and and Elon Musk tweets
deceptive headline backfires onto on
Reuters he puts it in quote deceptive
headline backfires on Reuters because it
turns out it wasn't true
they had actually exceeded their their
goal and Reuters did a headline saying
they'd missed it
it was literally opposite of the truth
but on Twitter
instantly flagged and instantly
corrected and even better yet instantly
publicly mocked by the guy who owns
Twitter
oh
can I be happier I can't be I can't be
happier than this that's everything I
wanted
everything I wanted was for Twitter to
start fact checking the fake news
and they did
you know what I'm waiting for
I'm waiting for I'm gonna whisper this
okay this is a Joe Biden whisper
I'm waiting for Joe Biden to do a speech
mentioning the fine people hoax again
please
just one more Joe
can you give us one more
find people hoax
now the Twitter is poised to call
 on that
I want to see Twitter put a note the
next time Biden has that who says that
because I think they're ready to do it
I think they might be poised
and it's going to be glorious same with
the Drake you bleach Oaks right
gonna be glorious
sex act that's act two what is act three
if I had to guess the government will
try to close down Twitter
somehow the I think the Democrats will
try to
take musk out of the game somehow
I think they'll fail
and then musk will turn Twitter into
what he's wanted to turn it into the app
that does everything
which could be worth 250 billion dollars
which would change the news
get rid of the woke virus
and make him ten times his or maybe five
times his investment
that would be a good act three with an
act four
all right
um I feel uh Vindicated
about an early opinion that the
so-called restrict Act was not about
banning Tick Tock which is the whole
point of it but was a way for the
government to get more power over more
things in general
and I called it down as as a you know I
guess a trojan horse
but I'm happy to see people who are
smarter than me by a lot on stuff like
this David sacks is saying it's a bait
and switch
basically they're trying to make it
illegal to use a VPN if you're not
technical
don't worry uh it just means that you
can what's the best way a virtual
private network is a let's say it's an
app you can put on your phone or your
device and you are not as easily
identifiable
it takes away your identity
so the point is that you could use a VPN
to get to a website that would be banned
otherwise
right because you'd be coming in as if
you're from another country for example
so let's say America bans tick tock
if you used a VPN to pretend you were
coming from not from America
then presumably technically you could
get in so the this this law tries to
block the use of vpns at least in this
context which is a big problem right
this is not what we signed up for when
the public said and a lot of the public
said ban Tick Tock they did not say
Banner vpns the VPN is what you use to
protect yourself from the
government
this is exactly the worst thing that
could happen it's the worst worst thing
that could happen instead of banning
Tick Tock they ban your vpns
it couldn't be worse
if anybody votes for this they have to
be dead to you Republican or Democrat
anybody who votes for this Mantra
monstrosity
this is beyond the pale right I don't
usually get worked up about little
political stuff usually it's just news
and it's fun but this is too far
and and the fact that they're doing this
right in front of us
they're not even I mean they're they're
hoping that we're dumb enough not to
notice that it was never a tick tock ban
but the fact that they're trying to get
away with this
through this back door
absolute scum
yeah you can't you cannot respect this
as a difference of opinion
would you agree
this is not about a difference of
opinion this is not politics this is not
policy this isn't anything this is the
government just you
there's no other way to look at this
like I get their little argumentative
blah blah blah might protect you in some
way
I don't care if you want a law
about banning vpns let's call it that
let's let's debate that
right let's debate that but if you're
going to hide this thing in a
tick tock band that's not really a tick
tock band and Tick Tock could probably
find a way around it anyway
oh my God
oh my God
I it's terrible
well I saw uh the Machiavelli account
that often has deep fakes
has helpfully created a well-labeled
deep fake so you can tell it's a deep
fake it's labeled that of Mark Warner
one of the main authors of this abortion
Bill well it's not about abortion but
you know what I mean
um
and he's got Mark Warner basically
explaining his own bill in his own words
as a deep fake
but you know being a clown about it
good job
and I think part of what Machiavelli is
showing well I know for sure because he
says it directly he's trying to warn
people what's coming
it's not about the meme
and he says it directly it's not about
the meme I'm showing you that you need
to you need to be afraid of this you
need to be aware of it you need to see
it coming we need to figure out how to
deal with it that that the news is going
to be fakes
and I think that's very helpful and it's
very ballsy it's so ballsy because I
think he's already been you know he's
had some trouble on Twitter already but
this was the perfect application of that
to I I like the application of having
somebody who's doing something sketchy
have their deep fake explain it to you
that's strong
that is wrong persuasion I like that
all right but I'm also happy that the
internet dads as I like to call them are
stepping up to call to call this out
um
all right what else we got
ladies and gentlemen
that's about all I have is there any
story I missed anything you wish I
talked about
I've been noticing that there are a lot
of stories that don't make the front
page of either Fox News or CNN
and yet pundits talk about them
which is weird it's a that's different
from before it used to be that
everything if it was a story at all of
any substance it would at least be on
one of those two sites but there's a lot
of stuff that's not on either side now
which is making me wonder what's going
on
all right
um
have we ever seen the full list of what
accounts on Twitter are allegedly
boosted and which ones are
well I guess just the boosted list was
that even real
because it was a story of I don't know
15 or so accounts that like cat turd
that apparently were boosted I don't
know if that story is real
what do you think
because if they had some of the list why
don't we have the whole list because
it's not that extensive maybe 30 people
I don't know
well we see Epstein's Client List
probably not
all right
um
there's no or when it there's there's no
organic way that cat turd could be
relevant agreed
so I bear I blocked captured that's a
that's an account on Twitter I blocked
cats heard a long time ago I forget why
but I'm sure I had a good reason
um but I've never understood why that
account got so big
to me that was always a mystery because
I didn't see value there
you know I understand why you know Jack
posabic has a big account I understand
why you know Mike cernovich has lots of
followers but I never understood
captured
like that did look like there was
something artificial going on there but
I didn't understand it
Dutch Farmers Revolt is never discussed
yeah I haven't discussed that
um and I'm not current on it but it
looks like there might be some pushback
that's working I think that's the
current situation
Paris protests are the Paris protests
being intentionally kept out of the news
I've seen those claims
oh Finland Finland decided to uh or
finland's in NATO
is that official yet finland's in NATO
I'm not sure that matters too much
um oh here's a question I have for you
I've seen stories about James O'Keefe a
number of them positive and negative on
Twitter but usually all I see is
somebody referring to it
I have no idea what the story is
there's there's some James O'Keefe story
that is not in the news because I looked
for it and quick search on social media
was people referring to it but I
couldn't find the actual allegation
what is the allegation
as he has he done something
oh Russell Brand was on Bill Maher last
night no I didn't see that
oh Finland voted their prime minister
out
but in addition they they joined NATO
right
they voted the Prime Minister out for
what reason
the ignore this media is ignoring the
Paul Town story
is the media ignoring the Paul Town
story
I am because I never heard about Paul
town
if you say Paul town again I'm going to
block you
so don't do that
all right I'll block you
so we're not going to talk about Paul
town and I'm not going to look into it
because you yelled it in caps too many
times so that's your rule you get the
opposite of what you yell in caps
goodbye
Finland voted in a conservative so
that's that's why that's news okay
uh James Keith knew about Mike Gill took
the money illegal wiretaps FBI Handler
sponsored by misraeli who is
I don't understand any of that I was
just reading a summary of the story and
there must be a large complicated story
but why have I not seen that anywhere
all right we'll get rid of all the Paul
Town references by the way I was
perfectly willing to look into whatever
was going on with Paul town but now I'm
not going to do it
all right
oh there's lots of people asking for it
oh there's lots of people who want me
not to talk about it all right I'm
definitely not talking about it now
so nope there will be nothing about Paul
town no too many too many
and and by the way whatever Paul town is
about I am not in favor of it so I'm
against Paul Town you've actually I
don't even know what this story is who
is he I have no idea but
um
but I'm opposed to whatever he is
I'm opposed to Mike town
only because of what you said about him
I don't know anything else
oh Mike town
I don't even know his name don't care
all right all right I'm going to turn
off YouTube because you can't stop
saying Paul Town bye for now
