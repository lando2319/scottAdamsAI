foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization yeah
you thought you'd see the Highlight
already but no this is it and if you
like your adventure to go to levels that
nobody's ever seen before all you need
is a cup of mug or a Class A tanker
jealous of Stein again team Joker flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee enjoyed me
now for them parallel pleasure the
dopamine the end of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip it happens now go
ah
well
if you're looking for your daily uh
Dilbert comic for you subscribers on
Twitter and also on locals uh if you
didn't know this already I think I've
told you this before I have something
called a calendar problem
meaning that I can't put things on the
right calendar dates
pretty much ever
I don't know why it seems related to
maybe
I don't know being dyslexic or something
but for some reason this has been all my
life because I know you I know what
you're gonna say I know what you're
gonna say but it's been all my life
right so there's never been a time when
it it wasn't the case so the child the
uh I'm sorry the Dilbert comic for today
will show up right as soon as I'm done
with this I'll post it but I do put the
data here's what I do
a week at a time
I I queue up all the comics to run
so I just is a very simple process I
just look at the date on the comic
and then I schedule it for that day
how hard would that be
if you were to do that six times you
know let's say I do it six times
out of six how many times would I
incorrectly put the wrong date in when
I'm just looking at the date I'm just
looking at it all I have to do is type
it in from looking at it how often out
of six
two out of six this week this week this
is with triple checking
triple checking two out of six I got
wrong do you know how often I would
write the wrong date on the comic itself
for 35 years while I was cartooning
about two out of five
no matter how hard I tried I don't know
what it is it's a it doesn't apply to
other domains it's just very specific to
calendars have you ever heard of that
and I when I get into a new relationship
it's the first thing I have to explain
I can't tell you how many times I've
said all right look there's going to be
a thing that's going to happen with us
you're going to ask me to put something
on a calendar and I won't be able to do
it you will not believe that this is
that I'm unable
because you'll see me functioning okay
in other ways you won't believe that I
simply can't write dates on calendars
and then it happens and then it's a big
fight
I'm like I told you yeah there's no way
this doesn't happen there's going to be
more of it not less of it oh well
enough about me
CBS is reporting some big breakthrough
of beaming power from space
the big Advantage would be if you could
build a ginormous solar power collector
up there you could actually microwave it
to microwave it to Earth and use it and
apparently this technology already works
because we can use it terrestrally to
lay the light bulb from a distance Etc
and it was just tested so I guess they
tested it with a satellite or something
and it works
so the amount of electricity you could
collect from space
is unlimited
and if you can beam it to Earth so that
it's never cloudy
in other words somewhere somewhere
around the world there's always going to
be some sun I guess so
um might be a big deal some people say
it could be a big deal
China is allegedly developing a neuro
weapon
where they can beam something at your
head and it'll make you stupid
um let me say that again
China is allegedly developing a weapon
that if they aimed it at you you would
become you know it would be difficult to
make decisions
I
and it does it it does beg the question
how long have they been using it
am I right
did they just point it at our media
I feel like they're pointing it at the
whole country right now
yeah how would you ever know if they'd
employed the weapon
can you imagine being on the battlefield
and you're like there with your your
fellow uh you know Fighters and you're
looking over at Bob and Bob's there like
you're like
oh I think he was a little bit like that
before
I'm not not entirely sure
Bob was the 2020 election rig
oh told it was fair it was totally fair
oh God oh God
now I'm not saying the election was
rigged
but we're going to talk about that later
in fact there's no evidence of it at all
there's no evidence it was rigged I just
want to be clear about that there's no
evidence it wasn't
but there's no evidence that it was
all right
um speaking of that I told you the other
day that uh Jank uweiger I think is his
last name notable Progressive type
um had agreed with the Supreme Court on
two things that the political right
liked more than the left he he liked the
Supreme Court on affirmative action
getting rid of it and he liked the
Supreme Court on not paying off student
loans
so a lot of people on the right were
praising him and I was one of them and
he wanted to he needed a little pushback
on that
so he tweeted this he said for the right
wing is celebrating that I'm pointing
out some left-wing activists can't stand
any disagreement remember your house is
made entirely of glass
the right wing is not allowed to
disagree with Trump when he makes up
outrageous lies about he how he won 2020
election
so I tweeted back I'm sure I won't get a
response uh how would any anyway the
only reason I'm going to read this
is I like to model for you the best
answer
in my opinion this is the best answer to
people saying hey you say that election
was rigged but there's no evidence of
that
here's how you answer
how would anyone know an American
election was not rigged we can only know
the results are impossible to fully
audit
and no confirmed rigging was found
but rigging is guaranteed over time
because the system invites it you don't
know if it happened yet
but it's guaranteed
that's the perfect answer
there is no way to know because you
can't fully audit the election you can
only know for sure that it's guaranteed
either now or later or maybe in the past
but is guaranteed by the design of the
system design tells you truth
did I just make that up
that sounded really smart when it came
out of my mouth I'll have to say it
again
design tells you truth
because the design is what drives
Behavior right if you design it so
there's one path
people take that path if you design it
so there are two paths but one looks
scary and one looks inviting people take
the inviting path
design is truth the election is designed
for rigging
that's the truth
I can't say that it was I can only say
it was designed to make that inevitable
it guarantees it
speaking of sketchy sounding things
um
actually one more thing about Jank
uh I yesterday I sent him a compliment
and maybe I was one of the people that
he may have yeah you can imagine what
happened when I complimented him
imagine the combat the comments
on my compliment
right the progressives have decided that
if you get a compliment from somebody
like me somebody like me
well that's no compliment is it
well anyway so but I do compliment Jake
because he quite knowingly
he knowingly degraded his own Economic
Opportunity
by disagreeing with this audience he did
that intentionally I I have massive
respect for that even if I disagree with
him on a hundred other things I'm not
going to lose the fact that I respect
that
so I'd like to see more of that
um Tucker Carlson was on Russell Brand
Show
and made news as Tucker often does and
Tucker says he got fired by Fox News uh
right before he aired um and apparently
he'd already done the interview but it
hadn't aired that was it the DC chief of
police or chief of Capitol Police
chief of capital police right he said he
interviewed the chief of the Capitol
Police and was told that uh the that the
chief of the Capitol Police
the person who would know the most about
what was going on
said the January 6th crowd was full of
feds
it was full of fats
I don't know what that means so we
haven't heard the interview so I don't
know if full of means 20.
what what in your brain how do you
interpret if somebody says oh that big
crowd so the crowd was thousands how
many were in the crowd
what's the size of the crowd
two thousand
six thousand somebody says
no not a hundred thousand six thousand
Maybe
does anybody know a number anyway so
thousands of people who were there how
many of those would have to be feds
before you would accept the
and before you would accept that there
were a lot of heads
right if there were thousands of people
there and there were 20 feds just
hypothetically would that be a lot
would 20 feel like they were controlling
events
I don't know that'd be on the low end
what if there were a hundred
if there were a hundred feds
do you think that they could control the
flow of the of the event by by creating
provocations or maybe breaking a window
that wasn't going to get broken
something like that
I don't know there's no way to know how
many there were but in in my mind just
subjectively as a consumer of news and
somebody who has to make political
decisions
it seems to me if somebody in that in
that role is saying that it was full of
them
probably more than 20.
probably fewer than 100.
I don't know
if I had to guess like you put a gun to
head and said make your prediction I'm
going to say
60. 60.
based on what nothing based on nothing
it's just based on one one person who
should know something about it that I
don't said there were many of them many
could mean anything right
 you David goodbye
I'd use your own channel
you're gone all right
uh let's talk about cocaine in the White
House
um so you know the latest story
this story just keeps getting funnier
uh
I don't think you could get funnier than
cocaine in the in the white house but it
just actually does it's getting funnier
and so
first it was found in the library
right
first it was fine in the LA find in the
library
goodbye
uh then it was moved to some other area
and then some other area and now they're
saying that it was in a construction
zone
isn't that convenient what what would
happen in a construction zone
what uh
what would be different about a
construction zone in let's say a remodel
in the White House what would make that
a unique and different place than all of
the other areas
huh you know if I were to get a remodel
an area
there's a pretty good chance I'd be
disconnecting the the video cameras
pretty good chance I mean you have to
move a wall and you know there's no
reason for the cameras there anyway
because you're just doing construction
yeah the first thing I do is remove the
cameras Now isn't that interesting
isn't that interesting
that of all the places it could be it
was in that non-camera place now they
haven't said that I'm just assuming
that's the next part of the story well
it was in the construction zone well it
took us a week to learn all week it took
us to research until we found out that
the construction workers had taken the
camera down it took us all week to
figure it out
there was no camera because the
construction worker took it down
don't you think that's happening
do you think that's coming
I don't know for sure if it's coming but
it feels like it is it feels like
they're signaling it they're signaling
it that is coming so clearly that you're
just waiting for that to drop today it
feels like it feels like that's today's
news right or would it be Monday
you know depending on how the news cycle
is going
but then my favorite part about it was
ah
this is just too good
uh the spokes clown uh cringe John
Pierre uh she's trying to answer this
question and and the reporters are
asking directly
did this cocaine belong to anybody in
the Biden family you know meaning Hunter
of course
so that would you would think that'd be
a pretty easy question wouldn't you
pretty easy question no no there's it is
not
stop asking that question no
no there's no indication to that
but did she say no
she did not say no
she had one job
she had one job just say no to that just
say no
she couldn't do it
instead she acts all mad like she's
answered it and then she says it again
again let me say that the bidens were
out of the White House those three days
again let me say it how many times do I
have to say they weren't there
well we're asking if it was theirs we're
not asking where they were we're asking
who owned it
how many times do I have to tell you
they weren't there okay okay we know
they weren't there got it got it but
we're still asking
can you say yes or no do they own it
because it's our understanding that the
cocaine did not go on vacation with them
it did not travel with them got it got
it we're all on the same page now can
you tell us if the ownership of the bag
maybe that had an encountered these
people at an earlier time for example
had it been their ownership
how many times do I have to tell you
that they were not there they were not
there
uh
did she throw Hunter under the bus
totally she totally the whole family
just threw him under the bus and I think
Joe must have thrown him under the bus
too I I feel like the private
conversation went something like this
Hunter
uh Hunter son
did you leave a bag of cocaine in the
White House
no dad I totally didn't
now what do you do
what do you do then
do you believe that Joe Biden believes
that Hunter Biden is always told him the
truth
let me introduce you to something called
a drug addict
draw that drug addicts never tell the
truth
is there anybody here who has been a
drug addict
who can confirm to me there's no such
thing as the truth
from a drug addict this is not a thing
it doesn't matter how much
it doesn't matter how good your
character was before you were an addict
before you're an addict your character
could have been exceptional
but addiction takes over your brain
you're not the same person you were
before the addiction the addiction is
your brain
right there used to be you
now you're gone you're actually just
gone
now there's just the addiction and it
lives in your head where your brain used
to be if you don't understand that about
addiction you don't know addiction
because I keep people I keep hearing
people say well the fentanyl problem
would go away if people would stop doing
the Fentanyl
they were not in the white house for
three days they were not the way it was
for three days I just feel like I had to
say that again
no you can't ask people to stop doing an
addiction
that's not what an addiction is that
addiction is the thing that you can't
choose
that's what makes it an addiction if you
can simply choose not to do it nobody
would be addicted nobody it would be
like the rarest thing instead of the
most common thing
right so here's the problem if Joe Biden
asked Hunter if it was his
and Hunter said no it wasn't
could Joe Biden believe him
given what logically would have been
their history right when you when you
have an addict as a son they have lied
to you that I don't think there's any
way around that really and anybody who
knows an addict knows that's true
um I have some people saying no
they're people who are are you addicts
are you addicts telling me that addicts
don't lie
there's a whole bunch of people saying
no
so you believe that addicts don't lie
just sort of as a general statement
all right that's ridiculous I'm not even
going to debate that
you just don't know what an addict is if
you believe that
all right so
uh
that's funny all right the threads app
as you know
um got gigantic pickup
lots and lots of people went over to the
new meta product that's going to compete
with Twitter called threads and I would
like to ask you this question dear users
thousands of you here many of you have
signed up for those of you who have
signed up for Threads
give me thumbs up thumbs down is it good
did you have a good experience bad
experience
tell me tell me what your first
impression was
all right just looking at your comments
here no interests banned for life
a number of people were already banned
for life over there
zero interest band it turns out a lot of
the people on the locals platform tried
it and are already banned
not interested not interested don't care
at all
Joyce all right well here's what
Zuckerberg says about it
um
he says it's for those the threads is
for those looking for Less angry
conversations
uh and he framed his new offering as an
open and friendly public space
does that sound fun
open and friendly public space
hmm yeah let me get right over there wow
I'll tell you that Zuckerberg sure makes
me want to do it
he's like he's like the king of
anti-marketing
yeah it's funny watching him compare to
it's impossible not to compare him to
musk because you know they're going to
literally have a cage fight so you have
to compare him it's impossible not to
now that they have a competing product
especially
uh or more directly competing product so
I don't think that Zuckerberg
understands what Twitter is
Twitter's sort of the place you've got
to fight isn't it
to it Twitter is not about avoiding
conflict
the thing that makes Twitter Twitter is
the conflict at least for the political
stuff you know there's a whole there's a
whole bunch of Twitter that's probably
just people tweeting their lunch still
but I don't see that part I only see the
political stuff
so on the political stuff people are
looking for a fight
and if they're not looking for a fight
they're at least looking to you know
raise their profile
which is not exactly a you know a holy
you know activity so basically
everything on Twitter is people's worst
instincts
but it's a free market
and the free market element of it the
the wild west free market of it is what
makes it valuable
because you put an idea on Twitter it's
going to get beat up
right
you take an idea you think is just
really good you put it on Twitter you'll
get the beat out of it if it still
is living when you're done with Twitter
might have been a good idea you survive
Twitter
right that's a good idea but suppose you
put it on threads and everybody said oh
that's good and people who said bad
things got banned
you wouldn't know anything it wouldn't
move you forward it wouldn't be a free
market it wouldn't be free speech it
wouldn't be anything
it would just sort of lay there
now maybe I'm wrong
maybe there's something better there I
will I will check it out by the way I
will take a look at it but
um I'm not hearing people who went there
and looked at it coming back and saying
they're hooked
is that is anybody saying oh man I was
on threads all day today
yeah it was bad enough I used to be on
Twitter all day but now I moved to
threads and I I spent four hours on
threads
nope all right now I'm going to tell you
the most provocative
theory that you will never hear in the
mainstream news do you know why you will
never hear this in the mainstream news
this will be a new reason not because
it's left leaning or anything like that
or right laning so not because it's
political
because they all have spouses
and I'll tell you why
the news care report this because
they're mostly married people
Zuckerberg is married
let me let me tell you what's happening
right now I'm not a mind reader so I
don't know for sure
so this is speculation but it's
speculation based on a universal truth
you ready for this
if you start a social media company
your spouse male or female so this is
not a gender thing it's not a gender
thing male or female your spouse will
believe that they also have excellent
ideas
for how you should manage that in social
media because you know why
everybody thinks they're an expert on
social media
do you know why I know this so well
I once owned a restaurant when I was
single
and then I got married
do you know who's an expert on
restaurants
everybody who eats at one everybody
who's ever eaten at a restaurant is an
expert on restaurants that's why I
started one I started a restaurant
because I ate at one you know so I
thought well I'm practically an expert
might as well start my own
yeah try try doing anything in your
restaurant that your spouse thinks is a
bad idea
try it try it just try to make any
change in your restaurant then you just
think is a good idea but your spouse
thinks it's a really bad idea
just try it
see how that goes
find out how your life goes after that
do you know how quickly you will talk
yourself out of your excellent idea
because you have to go home
your life is going home right your life
is not the product you made your life is
going home
and if home is ruined
by what you did over here
you can't go home
do you think that Zuckerberg wants
threads to work more than he wants his
marriage to work
of course not of course not he doesn't
need the money
so you know he probably needs his
marriage
so
I believe that Zuckerberg can't compete
with musk because musk is single
and musk has wisely Diversified his
wives because they're all ex-wives he's
Diversified them so even if one of his
exes or one of his kids complained musk
doesn't even have to listen to his kids
right because if one of his kids says I
don't like what you're doing on Twitter
he's got nine other kids or whatever it
is he's got the ultimate diversification
of influence over there like he doesn't
have to really pay attention to any of
them
but Zuckerberg does
so let me ask you this
do you believe that the um let's say the
censorship let's say scope you know
where they put the guard rails do you
think that's determined by Zuckerberg
by the people he's working with closely
or by his wife
who do you think determined the bounds
with which
threads can be provocative his wife his
wife do you think that she said anything
specifically to him
didn't need to I mean I don't know did
she need to no because everybody knows
their wife's opinion I'm by this point
he knows that he can't be Twitter
he cannot have on his platform the same
things that musk could have on his
platform because musk can just say it's
free speech and there's nobody to tell
him he's wrong
if Zuckerberg put the same content you
know the same edgy a lot of really
disgusting stuff if you put it on his
platform he wouldn't be able to go home
there's no way his wife's going to put
up with that
am I wrong
and I don't think that the news will
ever report this because first of all
it's all speculation so it's terribly
unfair
let me let me uh let me at least put
this Cathy out there I don't know
anything about Zuckerberg's life
but he's pretty smart
so if he chose her as a wife and they've
stayed together a long time
I'm guessing that she's pretty solid
human being and we know that she's super
smart right we already know his wife's
super smart
so it could be
that they have a situation in which uh
is completely opposite of everything I
described
so I want to put it out there that I
can't know for sure it's like a private
person I can't read his mind but if you
were to make me bet
on which of those two platforms had more
freedom to do the things it needs to do
I would bet on musk every time so I
think that Zuckerberg is competing with
one arm tied Beyond his back
he can't let provocative things on the
platform but it's the provocative things
that creates the energy
so I don't know we'll see he succeeded
more than I've succeeded so I think it
would be inappropriate for me to second
guess his business decisions that would
be quite arrogant of me he's obviously
brilliant at it one of the best
operators of all time
um and he might pull it off I think
there's a he certainly has a path he
might pull it off so I have a lot of
respect for Zuckerberg in terms of his
business skills uh but he's just
he's married it matters
all right the jobs report was kind of
lackluster but not too bad
um
which is probably good for inflation
can anybody tell if jobs going up or
down is good or bad for the economy
anymore
the most basic thing and we're not quite
sure well
well we we want people to have jobs but
if the job market is too hot it means
the economy is too hot
and that means inflation
and that means the FED will keep the
interest rates High
which will Tamp down on our you know so
basically everything's connected
so we can't even tell this the jobs
report is
good bad
it's not entirely clear
but I would say it's good
so here's my take my take is that it's
good because it's still strong the
unemployment's pretty low people are
looking for workers and to me it looks
uh
looks good so I think we're we're going
to limp along without anything that
looks like a major recession
um I would put my predicting about the
economy as the best in the business
foreign
so I predicted how many of you remember
that for quite a while now I predicted
that the the economy after the pandemic
winds down would either be not a
recession
or a very mild one
so I've been saying that from the start
it looks like we're on plan for that
so
good for us I heard Peter zayan who
talks about geopolitics talking about
China he was talking about some kind of
trade uh trade War thing with minerals
or some kind of component Which is less
important the important part is
um
that he said that that President XI in
China has purged all of the competent
government people
and he says that you can't do a deal
with China now because there's nobody to
do the deal
what
why am I only hearing that from him
why why is the only person saying that
wouldn't the rest of us know that so the
idea is that if you wanted to do let's
say a a deal with China over some
technology or microchips or something
that they wouldn't have anybody who'd
understand the deal
isn't that weird
that in China
they wouldn't have anybody who could
make a decision who would also
understand the deal
because they got rid of all those people
it used to be that the Chinese
government was heavily filled with
engineers
and the engineers are the perfect ones
to make a deal because first of all
they'd understand it and second of all
they're just looking for what works
right they're not not necessarily you
know operating on animal instinct
so maybe a lot of the people with
engineering and more technical skills
got purged maybe I'm not sure I I
believe that
so
so Peter zein's take on it is that China
will be going through a huge
incompetence problem
like actually government incompetence
like at a massive scale because they got
rid of all the good people
do you think that's real
that feels like a little too much
wishful thinking doesn't it
I mean I wouldn't be surprised if some
of the good people were purged
but it's hard to imagine it went that
far
maybe anything's possible
anyway he sounds very uh sounds very
convinced he also has a take that we're
not really in much trouble
if China decides to hold back on his
Rare Earth minerals and some other stuff
like gallium and stuff that apparently
there are other places in the world that
could spin up fairly quickly
it's just that presumably they don't
need to because it's coming out of China
so it's sort of like a two-month spin up
for anything they tried to deny us
and then Zayn's take is that China would
be in worse case than we would if we got
into a fight about raw materials
because we have all the silica
so they wouldn't be able to make silicon
chips so basically China would be
computerless if they decided to fight us
but we would have two months of a little
bit of problems and we'd be back to
where we were but China would be
computerless
I can't believe that either does any of
that sound real
so I don't know
yeah that apparently there's a special
kind of sand
that you need to make the chips we have
a lot in uh our our Southeast
so a lot of it's coming from America
yeah it but I think it has to be a
special guide to silica it's not it's
not uh it's not everywhere
that's what Peter Zayn says so I'm going
to say that I don't know enough about
that to judge the accuracy of it
um
let's see I would say that there is a
continued uh fast collapse of walkness
would you agree that you're seeing a
collapse of wokeness or not yet are you
seeing the collapse
let me give you some points
so clay Travis uh
was writing today in Fox News on their
website so the Bud Light
traffic is down 30 percent Bud Light
sales at 30 percent
nobody can ignore a 30 decrease in sales
of a top product you know the number one
product it was the number one product it
went down 30 nobody can ignore that
um but apparently as
uh as uh clay Travis was saying
um it's not widely reported but the NBA
took a gigantic hit when they went woke
did you know that
did you know that NBA viewership dropped
and didn't recover
yeah so that's two cases where wokeness
just took businesses out uh he didn't
mention Target but does anybody know
have Target sales resumed to where they
were or have they stayed lower
Disney's yeah Disney okay then here's
another one
um ESG
Larry Fink again reiterated that he
doesn't like to use it because it became
toxic
so he's worried the ESG became toxic
now
apparently he was surprised that over
racism in America would be considered
toxic
I don't know who saw that coming
ah racism is toxic ah surprise Larry
Fink
well he'll be delighted Larry Fink will
be when he's starring in a Dilbert
reborn comic
that's in the pipeline
um
I'm just making sure that the mocking is
complete
I don't want to leave anything on you
leave anything undone
um
but beyond that
BlackRock who is Larry Fink is the CEO
of BlackRock they're not the only ones
who think ESG is toxic there's another
report today that other CEOs are quite
pointedly avoiding mentioning it
so went from something you had to
mention do something that people are
afraid to mention
all right
but my favorite story
God love Fox News Fox News is just funny
like some of the some of the stories
they do they play us straight yeah they
play it like it's just a story but it's
just so funny and here's what they add
so Fox News had an indigenous Native
American Chief in Vermont
uh said he would be open to
you would be open to talking to Ben and
Jerry because Ben and Jerry are
concerned about America having stolen
all the land from the Native Americans
and he said he'd be open to talking to
Ben and Jerry about taking back the land
under its headquarters
hahaha
yeah I'd be open to that conversation
Ben and Jerry Ben hey hey Ben and Jerry
where are your homes
do you know nobody's ever produced a
whole picture of Ben and Jerry's Ben or
Jerry's house
do you think Ben and Jerry live in a in
a yurt
because because they love the they love
the Earth
so they're probably they're probably
living in a maybe a tent possibly a tent
so that they're not using up all the
resources of the Earth
wouldn't you love to see a picture of
either Ben or Jerry's house
wouldn't that be interesting never seen
one have you
do you think they live in a nice house
[Laughter]
well it won't be nice for long because
those Native Americans were going to
make a claim
for the land that they they stole to
build their their homes on
anyway I thought that was funny
but kudos to Fox News for having that
guy on that's the news I want to see in
the summer this is my perfect news story
for the summer
that that the Native Americans want to
take Ben and Jerry's land
you can't get any better than that
that's that's that's like top shelf news
right there
all right
uh also the Dutch government just
collapsed because their immigration
policies
the Dutch government just collapsed they
just surrendered basically so they're
going to have to form a new government
now it's not I'm not saying the country
collapsed their their government allows
this that's the form of government they
have it just means they have to form a
new Coalition it doesn't mean the whole
country collapsed
that sound that sounded worse than it
was right
that the government collapsed just means
they have to form a new Coalition
basically but it's a big deal
it's a big deal
so
um you can see it everywhere now can you
you can see it everywhere somebody else
pointed out that uh well I've said this
as well I think our language has now
been allowed
you could you can now vocally and
directly disagree and say this is a bad
idea to a lot of things that were maybe
a little problematic before
all right so I think everything's
heading in the right direction in terms
of that
so
um with Wall Street Journal had an
article by uh Peggy Noonan
now if you don't know Peggy Noonan she's
one of the best writers in the world you
know I've often called around as one of
the world's best writers
especially in politics and when I say
best writer it doesn't mean I'm going to
agree with her on all her points right
it just means when she writes a sentence
or makes a thought puts a thought on
paper it's just better than other people
can do it she's just insanely talented
but she she wrote an article and I
didn't read the article because that's
not part of the story
here's the story the headline of her
article said uh May Trump soon reach his
Waterloo
that was headline May Trump soon reaches
Waterloo
now does that sound like the walls are
closing in
yeah have they retired the walls are
closing it
now here's the thing you need to know
uh when I when I mocked this for not
being the walls are closing in I sort of
mocked it on Twitter Peggy Noonan just
retweeted my mocking
of the headline of her article
now why did she retweet it
why did she do that
just just guess why would she retweet
something that would look like a
criticism of the of the title lover
article
to mock me no no
why would she
to give traction PR no
no no no no
all right here's a little inside
knowledge inside baseball headlines are
not written by the author did you know
that
the headline is not written by the
author Peggy Noonan didn't write the
headline
no she didn't write that that was the
editor the editors put the headlines on
so I don't know what she's thinking
right because I can't read her mind but
I could put myself in her position
if I were in her position and I'd
written an awesome article and then an
editor had slapped the headline made
Trump suit reaches Waterloo on my
article
I would definitely want that Editor to
know
that the internet is mocking his his
headlight
I would definitely want the editor to
know that
and the way I do it is I just I would
just retweet what I said I would do
exactly what she said so remember I told
you she's smart she's really smart
so when you're when you're evaluating
her work
start with very smart and then you can
understand why she does what she does
right it's easy
um
so I never read the article I'm sure
it's great
all right let's talk about DeSantis
versus Trump
um was it two days ago I told you the
DeSantis campaign apparently has just
disappeared
and you all said yeah where is it well
the Wall Street Journal is also
reporting that the campaign is uh
struggling stalling they use the word
stalling and I think that's the right
word because he's not getting much much
attention so I'm going to tell you what
something that Santa said and then we're
going to talk about some of the promises
that Trump has made if he is re-elected
right now I want you to contrast and
compare these two leadership styles
right so first uh DeSantis
so here is him defending you know this
is just one part of lots of things he
says but he said quote recently I have
the best record of defeating the left on
issue after issue and we uh and we will
be making that case over the next six or
seven months he said I'm running to win
in January and February I'm not running
to juice polling numbers so he was
talking about
he wasn't doing uh he wasn't gaining in
the polls so he was dismissing the polls
all right so he has the best record is
he left on issues that feels like a good
point doesn't it
if he has a solid record of defeating
the left as he says
that's pretty fair point for a primary
and he's running to win
and he's going to be making this case
all good points solid solid executive
all right now let's compare to Trump
Style
these are just a few of the things that
Trump promised in his rally speech
uh Trump said if he's elected that he
would ask Congress to ensure that drug
smugglers and human traffickers can
receive the death penalty for their
heinous acts he also said that he would
take down the drug cartels by imposing
Naval embargoes on cartels cutting off
cartel's access to Global Financial
systems and using Special Forces within
the Department of Defense to damage the
cartel's leadership
okay he'll be doing that but meanwhile
uh census will be he's got a good record
of defeating the left he'll be working
on it for a few months and he's trying
to win the election he's not trying to
juice the polls
let's see what else uh Trump said
he said that he would uh spearhead an
effort to build these Freedom cities
with and flying cars so he wants brand
new cities that would be built with
vertical takeoff and Landing vehicles to
make sure that we are the leader in all
these things and it would be like
bringing back Frontier
Frontier kind of sensibility to America
which we've sort of lost a little bit by
using government layout to build new
communities from scratch with flying
cars oh my God now that's what Trump
would do flying cars in New cities and
bring us back a frontier attitude I
remind you that Ron DeSantis will be
running on his record of uh
feeding the left
also Trump said
he'll create a special team to rapidly
review and reverse all of Biden's Equity
agenda
now I I think DeSantis would do the same
thing
but it was worth mentioning
um
can you see the difference
do you see the difference
it's like when you compare them next to
each other
well let me let me say it a different
way if there had never been a trump
if Trump had never existed
how awesome would this antis look
pretty good
because what he's offering is that he
keeps beating the left
and that's what he's selling to the
right
who would not want to buy that who
doesn't like to win who doesn't like the
guy with a solid track record of doing
all the right things consistently
in a giant state
it's really funny to think how solid
DeSantis is and he can't even get he
just has no traction
Trump is just such a glowing you know
Death Star
that you know the little Thai fighters
looking for the the opening and the
exhaust
so yeah anyway
um
it doesn't look like anything could stop
Trump from getting nominated here's what
it looks like
I believe that uh Vivek will continue to
make progress against DeSantis probably
not so much against Trump
and if Trump gets the nomination who's
he going to pick for his VP
obviously not DeSantis would you agree I
would say desensis has zero chance of
being a VP
but do you remember Vivek saying
anything bad about Trump
ever
ever
even one thing
what does that tell you and how much do
Vivek and Trump agree on the big stuff
how much do they agree on the big stuff
completely
maybe completely
right they have different proposals for
you know how to move forward which makes
sense
but I don't think they disagree
right if if you ask for fake what about
this idea of building these cities and
making sure America is leading in in
flying cars what would he say
would you say that's a terrible idea
I doubt it because it's actually a great
idea it's a great idea one of the best
ever actually
and so here if you look at how things
are forming up
Vivek is the perfect vice president
now it's up for me to say that
because I you know I'm endorsing Vivek
so I would like I would like him to win
straight up
and I think that Trump always has the
you know is he going to go to jail any
minute thing
is it is Waterloo are the walls close
again I mean Trump always has that
little element of risk around him so you
never know right Anything could happen
there's age there's anything there's
just plenty of surprises that could
happen
so at the very least the fake is you
know a perfectly good
alternative if something happens
but if things go the way they look if
you just you know straight line it Trump
gets the nomination
and then he has to pick a running mate
do you think he could do better than the
faith
as a running mate
does anybody think he could do better
I mean think about it no it's not going
to be RFK Jr now I could easily see RFK
Jr being asked to do a project you know
like something about vaccine safety
you're you know raving in big Pharma or
something like that I could definitely
say that by the way a trump
um
partnership with RFK Jr let's say if
Trump got reelected
I I would think that would be the best
of America
that would be we're back
that would be the ultimate we're back
moment it's like hey America's back
I'm not predicting it's going to happen
but it could because they do like each
other and they have some common common
goals they're very much good if it did
that would be the just the greatest
feeling
because it would mean that we had
finally we'd finally taken
the job over the politics
you know a rare thing that that would be
a case of clearly putting the job over
the politics and I think both of those
men could do that
I think they both have that capability
which is rare but I think they both have
it
all right
um
let's talk about uh Lindsey Graham he's
now pushing hard to get a Ukraine
accepted into NATO you would not be
surprised to hear that Thomas Massey
disagrees with that idea thinking that
the NATO expansion may have been the
problem
now
what is wrong with Lindsey Graham
is it exactly what it looks like that he
just works for the military industrial
complex and he's just their guy is that
is that the whole story
is that the entire story that he's just
working for them because I don't see his
argument
where's his argument
in what world does that make the world a
safer place
and here's what's wrong with it now if I
just say I don't like his argument I
don't like it but he likes it that's not
much of an argument right
all right here here's the argument that
absolutely destroys Lindsey Graham's
credibility you waiting for it
you don't take off the table your
biggest variable for the negotiation
he's taking it off the table
because if that got approved it's never
going back the other way
there isn't the slightest chance that if
they get into NATO that we will agree
with Putin to remove them from NATO you
get that right
once I get in there isn't any way they
get out it's a one-way path
but as it stands
somebody like a trump could go to Putin
and say look Putin
this is over it's over
here's what you're getting
you're going to get maybe some land and
no NATO
what what Ukraine is going to get is the
full guarantees of staying a state
because even though they're not NATO
even though they're not NATO
we'll be back
we will be back if you with them
again
and this time it won't be you know with
Light Equipment right so you can imagine
Trump very easily saying I got this
variable to deal with I got this
variable to deal with let's make a deal
but Lindsey Graham is taking away the
biggest variable
because if if Putin at the end can't say
he stopped to Nato
he's he didn't do anything
how can he possibly make that deal how
could Putin ever agree to a deal
that allowed Ukraine to turn NATO
goody
how could he ever agree for that so to
me it's it's not even whether it's a
good or bad idea he's just taking the
main variable for negotiation off the
table at exactly the time we should be
negotiating now
I will I will allow that there's one
possibility that would redeem him
the one possibility that would redeem
him as if he's playing bad cop which is
possible he might be playing bad cop
so it might be that everybody sees that
negotiations are getting closer
and Lindsey Graham wants to push the
Ukraine nature thing right up to the
edge
so that Putin thinks he only has a week
to go before they turn NATO and then
then maybe he's going to deal so it's
possible
remember it's possible remember Lindsey
Graham's not stupid right we're not
talking about dumb people here Lindsey
Graham knows that if it becomes NATO
that takes the variable from
negotiations off the table
he may be doing it to bring it right up
to the edge so that the negotiations are
the maximum strength they could be
that's possible
I don't think so
but I wouldn't rule it out
all right
these blackmailable somebody says I
don't know
do you think anybody would care if
tomorrow it came out and I'm not saying
this is the the case because I don't
know if tomorrow it came out that
Lindsey Graham was gay
and just let's say he just came out of
the closet would anybody care
anybody
it wouldn't wouldn't have any impact on
anything would it it would just be a
news story for about 48 hours
yeah then the the left would do lots of
stories about then why did he do this or
why did he
do that if he did something I know
but I I just assumed that
is his business
I don't think you could be a republican
if you care that much
right I'm I'm not a republican but could
you be a Republican and really care so
much about somebody's what they do
behind the closed door
because Liza Graham is the if it if it
turned down he's gay and I'm not saying
he is or isn't I have no idea but you
know that's the speculation of course
but if he were
wouldn't he be exactly the kind of gay
that Republicans like which is you would
just be living his life
just leaving leaving everybody else
alone
is that exactly what everybody wants
it's pretty much exactly what everybody
wants just leave us alone just don't
make it our problem do what you want
yeah no I don't so I don't I don't think
he's that blackmailable well on that if
it turns out because some people are
speculating that he's blackmailable
and I would say there's no evidence of
it
but who knows
yeah all right be nice let's let's be
less homophobic if you don't mind there
on YouTube
a little less homophobic please
if you don't mind
all right uh
Twitter user on Hoodwinked
um
was doing a rundown of my persuasion
right so here are a list of things that
either I helped cause
or alternately I was just good at
predicting they were going to happen
anyway
so you get to judge
did I have any influence on these things
and I actually don't know
so you don't you know I don't have any
inside knowledge I know what you know
um or or is it just am I just a good
predictor all right here are some of the
things
China is now deemed unsafe for a
business
all right I was the first person you
heard saying that China was unsafe for
business and now that's common knowledge
did I predict it now keep in mind keep
in mind that when I said it it was
considered ridiculous do you remember
that
that when I started saying China is
unsafe for business it was because of
fentanyl originally but when I first
started saying it I was widely slapped
down as that's ridiculous China is solid
we'll always be doing business with them
it's safe enough
and now the general opinion of all of
business people is it's unsafe for
business
did I do that or did I predict it keep
in mind nobody predicted it
zero people predicted that zero there
wasn't a single person in the world who
predicted what what I told you was going
to happen
did I cause it or predict it
I don't know here's another one so ESG
is now uh you know it's a toxic term
well I probably was one of the people
who are influential on that but lots of
people have had lots to say
did I predict it
or help cause it
I don't know I don't know I do know that
Dilbert has completely stopped other
things
so it would be it wouldn't be unusual or
even not even a little bit unusual if I
had stopped it or if I'd had some
influence but who knows I have no idea
here's another one
um the idea of attacking the Mexican
cartels directly with military
I was the first person to say we should
do it everybody mocked me and now it is
a standard Republican policy
did I cause that or did I predict it
because it was a little bit predictable
wasn't it
because as fentanyl got worse and worse
what else was going to happen right so
it was predictable
but did I cause it
I don't know I have no idea
how about Tick Tock being banned being
banned
I believe I was one of the first to say
tick tock needed to be banned for its
you know influence on us
now that's General that is generally
understood it's not banned but I think
maybe a republican
Administration probably would
but did I cause the
the feeling that Tick Tock should be
banned or did I just predict that others
would feel the same I don't know
how about the fact that fentanyl is
considered a top concern for Americans I
think that was going to happen just
because of the death count so I don't
take any credit for that how about
nuclear power being considered green
I'm one of a number of people
who have been you know pushing that
theme for a while Michael schellenberger
right
Mark Schneider
there's so there are people who push
there harder than I did but for a time I
had a bigger audience
so I could I could um
you know I could boost their signal
which I did and then other people saw
them and boosted their signal as well so
I know I worked hard to get us to this
point
but I don't know what an influence I had
if any what was that also not
predictable
it wasn't also predictable that this
eventually we would have to call nuclear
green because the facts the facts were
all on that side I mean all of the facts
were on one side so predictably you
could you could say in the long run
people come to their senses that's all
there was
all right how about
um
well one of the ones that on Norwood
would add was a safe to discuss moving
away from areas deemed to be unsafe for
certain groups
I I would generalize that to say I
believe you can now say in public
things that you couldn't as much say in
public before I got canceled
now that's not because of me it could be
just because the world is heading that
direction but I do think I do think that
my cancellation was one of the signals
that things had gone too far
would you agree
I think my cancellation was just one of
the signals it may be a big one because
a lot of people noticed
the things that have gone too far
and you know it's the interesting thing
I'm pretty sure that there's no real
person who thinks I'm a racist
like in the real world you know on
Twitter and stuff people say what they
need to say for their team but I don't
think anybody actually thinks so
the the way people treat me
is that the story was the story
but that I'm somewhat independent from
that meaning that they don't actually
think I'm a racist
because of not you know I have a whole
long history that would you know
certainly debunk that idea
so
I feel like
partly because of my sacrifice
accidental sacrifice didn't do it
intentionally that
um
that the world has a little bit more
free speech
or
or was it just going to go that way
anyway
maybe it was just going to go that way
because you know Angela it would be easy
to just say oh the pendulum comes back
and you would be right 99 of the time
so
those are just some things that I either
predicted or possibly
or possibly
caused
Don Lemon needs a wacky sidekick
I would love you know I would love Don
Lemon that's my sidekick
well or or just like a broadcast partner
yeah
Andrew tatus in jail
I didn't cause that I did not I did not
cause Andrew Tate to be in jail
but it wasn't hard to predict it might
happen
it is funny how often things go my way
the things I want to happen but no I
didn't cause that to happen and I'm not
sure that he's being jailed for a real
crime so we'll see if he's being
railroaded
uh I don't see Tucker Carlson running
for office
actually Tucker said he's not political
he said that in Russell Brand he's not
he's not even that interested in
politics
so now he's not going to run for office
Biden said Ukraine he's running out of
ammo everybody says everybody's running
out of ammo the thing I don't believe
anymore
Scott why didn't you defend Alex Jones
when he was censored
are you kidding
Scott why didn't you defend Alex Jones
when he was censored
all right I'm going to tell you a little
behind the scenes the fact that I've
never said before in public
when Alex Jones first got in trouble and
the platforms were canceling him
Jack Dorsey actually dm'd me and asked
my opinion on canceling
Alex Jones
do you remember that Twitter did not
cancel Alex Jones do you remember that
eventually they did but do you remember
when the first round happened he was not
canceled and and the News was talking
about how Twitter alone
Twitter alone didn't cancel them
that was right after Jack Dorsey asked
my opinion
now I'm not saying I had an influence
I'm not claiming that
but you just accused me of not defending
him
take it back
because I don't think anybody offended
it I don't think anybody defended him
more usefully
I don't think anybody did
so maybe you should be a little more
informed before you make assumptions
like that there's a lot that happens
behind the curtain that you wouldn't
possibly know
you couldn't know that there's no way
you could know that right
now I will tell you that Jack and I had
a good relationship sort of behind the
scenes we had a lot of philosophically
and you know intellectually we have a
lot in common
so
I don't know if I had any influence on
this decision
but I do know that he felt that asking
me for my opinion would be part of his
process for making the decision and when
it was done he did not ban him he later
did but you know thing things took on a
bigger life
right so
uh and by the way I like I like Alex
he's a real engaging fun
warm kind of guy so it's a real you know
just in my Brief Encounters with him it
was just all positive
um
all right I think that's enough for now
um YouTube thanks for joining
and I'll have you back tomorrow for more
fun
