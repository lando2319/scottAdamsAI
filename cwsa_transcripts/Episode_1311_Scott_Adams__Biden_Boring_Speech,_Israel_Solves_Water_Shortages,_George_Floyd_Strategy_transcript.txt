well it's the best part of the day again
isn't it great that you get one of these
every day
yeah you wake up and next thing you know
you're having a simultaneous sip and
you're thinking
wow this is great and it is every single
time
and to make it even greater all you need
is a couple of more glasses thank you to
dallastine canxida flask vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch how good this is
you ready go
yeah i don't think i oversold it
that was pretty spectacular well
should we start with the good news that
nobody seems to be reporting
when i say nobody i mean nobody except
jake novak
who put together three facts that i was
not aware of
uh and when you see them together it's
quite a story
and the facts are these number one
an israeli company has built these
devices that can extract
drinking water from the air so it will
take the humidity the moisture in the
air
and it very effectively turns it into
water
up to 800 liters of fresh water per day
if the devices i saw in the picture are
the right devices
it looks like maybe the size of i don't
know
two or three refrigerators put together
so it's not a
it's not like a factory sized it's
something you could put on trucks i
think
and they must have they must have
figured out
some way to make this more efficient
likewise you may be aware that israel
had
offered to iran i believe to help them
with desalinization
because israel is good on desalinization
they need to be
because they need to get water wherever
they can um but then there was a third
thing that
jake novak pointed out you should follow
him on twitter by the way
um that there's another israeli company
that developed a drip
irrigation system for growing rice
so you don't have to flood the rice
paddies
so so those are the three things
desalinization
taking water directly from the air in
some new efficient way
better than before i guess and then a
way to do agriculture with way less
water some kind of a drip irrigation
system
so you take those things three things
collectively
and uh that's a pretty big deal
you know you you don't see them all at
the same time
so you sort of lose sight of the fact
that while we were thinking about other
things
israel used technology basically in
science
to solve one of the biggest problems in
the world that we might run
out of fresh water now think about
your 80-year product projections for
climate change what is one of the base
assumptions of
of the the assumption that climate
change will
be devastating in the future well the
problem is that
things that are working now will break
such as
people who have access to water might
have droughts
in the future and other people might
have floods
and i've been saying forever that you
can't do that kind of a
80-year projection because there would
be too many inventions and surprises
along the way
you can't predict that stuff well here's
one
in in what part of the 80-year
projection of you know water needs and
and climate change and all that where
did they calculate the israel
would pioneer yeah or or improve
three major uses of water and actually
create it in the sky
more efficiently so that's all good news
i'll put that out there i noticed today
that uh one of the
one of the trending things on twitter
most of the morning
was the phrase dementia joe
so of course i clicked on it to see what
that was all about
and one of the things i noticed is that
uh i guess a number of conservatives are
using it
uh to refer to joe in his speech etc
but democrats really don't like this
hashtag
which is partly why it was trending
because they were they were fighting
against it so much it just made it
true but um
that's an interesting thing isn't it why
is it that of all the things that
anybody can say about biden this one
you could tell by the comments it sort
of sort of
hit a nerve somehow whereas
normal political speech doesn't always
hit a nerve it's just
more routine and i feel as if there's a
thing
happening now and it's happening in slow
motion
and it's hilarious
because we can't really talk about it
exactly
and it goes like this all the people who
supported biden
for president had to
mentally do something to be okay with
the fact that
quite obviously he wasn't as sharp as he
used to be
now i imagine that the way they dealt
with it is either to
just not think about it because all they
cared about is getting rid of trump
or they met they minimized it in their
minds
to the point of well yeah okay he's
he's older but it's not that big a deal
but the predictable the predictable arc
of things
is that it's just going to get more and
more obvious
51 days without a press conference
51 days without a press conference it's
kind of
obvious now and then you see all the the
gaff clips etc
so i feel as if the democrats are
feeling exposed meaning that
it's going to look like everything that
conservatives said about joe biden's
mental capacity
is not just true but it's really really
obviously true and it matters
how are they going to deal with that how
does anybody deal with being wrong
well most of us do it the same way we we
get triggered into cognitive dissonance
and then we somehow explain it like it
wasn't wrong
even if it was so
uh i'll just note that dementia joe
seems to really get under their
their skin in case you want to use that
now the democrats are trying to
respond with their own hashtag which is
getting a lot of use
damn straight and a
number of tweets to say stuff like we
finally got a real president
damn straight so
i don't know i think damn straight is in
the category of
no malarkey it's like people coming up
with slogans
who are not good at coming up with
slogans
damn straight how does that
how does that hit you it just feels
a little cringy doesn't it yeah okay if
somebody was actually typing cringe
as i said it it's a little bit cringy
compare that to make america great again
now i know people had their problems
with it thinking it was some kind of a
racial thing
but in terms of coming up with a slogan
or you know a branding when you see
when you start to see people were not
good at it
do it directly after you've watched
trump be really really good at it
like as good maybe better than anybody's
ever been
right if you count all his nicknames you
know everything from
low energy to you know lie and ted to
you know if you kill all of that
trump was basically hitting home runs
every time he got up to bat
you know drain the swamp almost
everything that trump
tried to turn into a a saying or a logo
or a statement worked everything from
fake news you name it he turned
everything he wanted to turn into a you
know into a thing
he turned it into a thing but then you
watch people who
are not good at it damn straight
damn straight it trended today
but i don't think it's going to turn
into anything it feels a little like no
malarkey
if you know what i mean people who don't
know how to do this
trying to do it
uh this morning uh brian stelter uh
tweeted he showed a screened screenshot
that i've been laughing about for a
while so apparently when biden was
giving a speech if fox news
ran a chiron the words that go at the
bottom of the screen there
they ran a chiron that said
and what's funny about this is that this
is a news channel
and the the the amount of
uh you know partisanship uh
sometimes it crosses that line where you
just have to laugh it's just hilarious
so here here's fox news's label for
biden's speech while he's talking
so while he's talking below and it says
low bar
colon biden survives short scripted
speech
survives what kind of news is that
he survives it
because because it it gives you the
impression
especially because it's a you know
allegedly a news channel
it gives you the impression that there
was some
that there was some chance he would die
right in front of you
or that his career would be over because
you know
because you would be so undependable
that you would just spout out with
something crazy and it would be it would
be over
now let me say if cnn
had done a chiron as ridiculous as this
one
i would have i would have also called it
out right
so this this works both ways but i have
to give fox news credit
because theirs is pretty funny i think
if it's
funny you get a little extra
a little extra forgiveness right
i feel like that fox news accomplished
that so where
whoever it is i know there's some fox
news producer watching this right now
but uh whoever it is was in charge of
that chiron
good job from an entertainment
perspective it was a good job
so here's the second part of that story
so after i saw this
and it was you know brian stelter from
cnn talking about fox news and how they
cover stuff
i tweeted that 20 of all news involves
people in the news business
criticizing each other now
when i said 20 that wasn't to be taken
as an
actual estimate right it's just that it
seems like they spend a lot of time
criticizing the other channel if you
turn on fox news they're talking about
cnn you turn on cnn
they're talking about fox news and
so uh so so i tweeted 20 of it is just
that
and within a few minutes brian stelter
tweeted back
uh at me and he said no it does not
or i don't know you tweeted not
necessarily at me
uh and here's the thing
when i'm using social media
i forget sometimes
especially if it's somebody famous who's
you know like brian stelter or somebody
you know
i forget that they actually read it like
somehow
somehow my brain can't i can't handle
the fact
that i'm typing you know using a tool
which of course
the whole point of it is people are
reading it
and i still can't i can't get it in my
head
that when i type a response to somebody
famous they'll actually read it
it still blows me away and so when he
when he tweeted back i was thinking
oh we actually read that
and um
and i i understand when i do it
why people are are so mean and ugly to
me
because every now and then i'll respond
back to some troll who just said
something awful about me
and uh and sometimes they'll say
something like whoa whoa i didn't think
you'd read it
[Laughter]
so just remember there are real people
reading this stuff
uh jack pasabic
reports that he's hearing from his
multiple
insider sources at the white house that
kamala harris is getting the full uh the
pdb
what is that daily the um
it's the briefing what does the pd stand
for
daily briefing presidential daily
briefing i'm going to go with
let's let's say that i'm going to say
presidential daily briefing
but caballeros is getting the full full
one
which even we think that even biden
didn't get that
when he was vice president now
getting back to my earlier comments
about how democrats are going to have to
come to terms with the fact that they
elected somebody
who quite clearly is not medically
fully available if you know what i mean
and every time there's this little bit
of
you know the cats on the roof it seems
like it's going forever isn't it
like how long have we seen these cats on
the roof like well it's a little bit of
a hint
that they're not expecting him to last
that long even biden says stuff like
he's not going to run for a second term
etc so
it's just funny every every time you see
another another piece of evidence
that it's clearly the plan to put her in
place
uh you just gotta wonder what they're
thinking
so i hear that comedians are having a
hard time mocking
biden because they don't have anything
to grab onto
you know trump was easy he had just a
million targets that you could shoot at
but biden is super boring
and if you were to ask people what's the
one
sort of uh i don't know personality
thing that stands out or
or what do you think of when you think
of joe biden what's the what's the top
thing that comes to mind
it's medical it's medical
right is his mental capacity and it's
not
really super cool
to make humor about people's medical
conditions
now i would think a president's a little
bit of an exception to that because
sometimes you have to mock things to get
them fixed
and maybe having a president who's not
quite all there needs to get fixed
so here's a special case
but isn't it interesting that he's so
bland
the only thing you could mock you don't
because it's real if
don't you think that they would be
mocking biden uh
if they thought that wasn't real don't
you think they'd be
there would be more people on the even
on the left who would take a run
at it's like oh he's dumb hahaha you
know
hahaha he's not as fast as he used to be
hahaha he does some gaffes
but they don't really do that do they
they don't really do that somebody says
they mocked
reagan um was reagan ever this bad
you know i'm trying to remember yeah i
think you could certainly detect
there was something going on with reagan
i don't think reagan was ever like this
was he
maybe i just don't remember it clearly
all right uh so i watched let's talk
about biden speech
uh i might surprise you by saying i
thought it was
pretty good pretty good if i'm if i'm
going to be objective
which is the only value i have to you is
trying to be
unbiased if i can i thought his speech
was pretty solid
meaning that what he was trying to do
was project empathy
and he gave us some dates which i wanted
i wanted to hear a date when he thinks
he can get the vaccinations may first
everybody should
have access to it it's good um
i'm seeing your comments about whether
reagan was as bad a little bit of a
disagreement about whether he was he was
as bad some say yes some say no
so i i don't have a strong memory of
that at this point
but uh so i'm going to give biden you
know a solid
a solid mark it was not exciting i
literally
started falling asleep toward the end it
dragged on it was a little too long
you know he's not like a great deliverer
of anything
but for what the country needed it was
pretty solid
good information fairly specific
now the of course the thing that
everybody's mocking
is the uh
i think everyone who watched this had
some kind of similar feeling to it
when he was saying that by fourth of
july he's hoping that people
can get together for their fourth of
july barbecues and whatnot
and then he slipped in but not large
groups
and i'm sitting here thinking what did
you just say
and and then he sort of i think he
clarified again you know that
you'd be able to have fourth of july but
not in a large get-together
to which i and something like 300 plus
million americans or i don't know
whatever tens of millions were watching
the
speech simultaneously said to themselves
see if this happened in your head did
you simultaneously all over the country
say to yourself you
 you here's what's going to happen
on july 4th
i and every one of you are going to make
your own mind up about what
you're going to do
and the government's instructions to you
by july 4th
because by then it's it's a different
situation we hope by july 4th
it's not the government's decision
and even their suggestion will be taken
as
a suggestion all right
by july people are going to do any
 thing they want
and i don't think there's any any way
around that
now a lot of people will want to play a
safe a lot of people will want to do
what the government
suggests because they want to that's
fine but
there was something about the way he
presented it
that carried with it a whiff of
presumption
that the government can tell you how to
celebrate the 4th of july in your own
 backyard
and that didn't go down well did it
how'd that feel didn't feel good
didn't feel good and and i've been quite
supportive of the government having some
you know a big hand in the pandemic
i think sometimes the government needs
to be the the one with a big hand or a
big footprint i guess
uh but that would be too far right
there's a point where everybody says
it's too far and
and i think biden reached that so that's
not the biggest problem in the world
the the other thing about his speech is
that there's a lot of darkness and gloom
and
it was kind of long and boring and low
energy but
it got the job done um here's a question
i have for you
if you believe that biden is doing a
good job
with pandemic management and i would say
he is
does anybody disagree with that is there
any disagreement
that biden is at the administration is
doing a
solid job with the uh i
i i would fault him with school openings
he should put more pressure on the
teachers unions
that's a big deal but i feel like i feel
like it's
you know happening like people are going
back to school already
vaccinations are looking pretty solid
messaging looks pretty good
i think it's solid but here's the
question what is it that biden has done
that the trump administration would not
have
you know predictably done so for example
under
under biden the rate of vaccinations is
way up
well don't you think that would have
happened under trump as well
because we know that however it starts
it's going to be slow compared to
you know how quickly it will ramp up
so i don't see any reason that we should
assume biden did a better job
i don't see any evidence for that in
fact trump might have put
more pressure on teachers unions
although that could have been
counterproductive you could make an
argument that if trump had gone harder
at teachers unions they would have just
hardened their
their stand against him so it's hard to
predict
but i don't think there's any reason to
think biden did a better job than
trump would have if he had been in
office um
i tweeted yesterday something that i
knew would get
get people angry or bothered
but there wouldn't be a reason which is
my favorite kind of tweet
where people would feel like they should
be offended
on behalf of somebody else they're not
sure who
and they're not sure exactly why but
they're definitely offended
if they can only figure out why
here is my tweet um
i i said that uh if i were the uh
if i were the attorney defending uh
derek chauvin the uh
officer who is charged with uh now i
guess second or third degree murder one
of those murders
i would say that i would deliver my
closing argument
laying on the ground if i were the
lawyer laying on the ground
and i would have my client put his knee
on my neck
much the way he did with george floyd
and for the entire
nine minutes i would time it so it was
the same amount of time as
as uh floyd was held down as the lawyer
i would just speak normally and i would
just have the
you know i'd be on the ground with the
officers
now not officer but ex-officer's knee on
my neck
and i would say all right we've
presented all the evidence and
as you can see you know there's plenty
of reasonable doubt
the main reason that you uh and the
world was so concerned
is that the visual of this is just
deeply disturbing
but as you can see the reason that this
is a legal
hold and it's trained and the officers
are trained this way
is that if you do it right it doesn't
put much pressure on the neck and as you
can see
i'm delivering my closing arguments
completely
without any air restricted and yet i
can't move
i can't get up can't get up
now uh do you think people complained
about that tweet
oh yeah you always get
this guy do you know who this guy is
he's the he's the guy it's usually a guy
it's usually a guy right i could be a
woman
i don't want to be sexist but it's
usually a guy who comes in
and says something like this
a man died
you're laughing and a man
died this is not a joke
you always need that guy right the guy
to remind us
that there was a tragedy is there
anything
that is more well understood than
whatever the
whatever that was it was a tragedy
is there anybody who doesn't know that
and here's the second part
it wasn't a joke if you laughed on it if
you laughed at it
well that's sort of on you because it
wasn't written as a joke
it was written as a persuasion
now of course i don't assume
that the lawyer would do anything like
that in order to do that you need a
certain kind of personality
let's say johnny cochran if johnny
cochran
cochran were alive
and he heard that idea
what do you think if johnny cochran
heard that idea and he were the defense
attorney
just lay on the ground put the knee on
you and do your closing argument
just like that he would at least
consider it now he might say no that's
too far or whatever because you know
clearly he was the highest level of
defense attorney so he might say that's
a bad idea for
good reasons but i think he'd at least
consider it
i think he'd consider it i i feel as if
he would give it a good
thought and here's the thing there is
nothing disrespectful about that
nothing it's not even a little bit
disrespectful
it's persuasive i mean if it worked
right
now here i'm making a big assumption
that i think is fair
which is that if somebody has their is
holding you down with that
knee hold on your neck they probably
have a lot of
leeway in terms of how painful
or damaging that is and i don't think
you can tell just by looking at it
on the video i don't think you could
tell so it would be a it would be
i don't know how they could possibly
convict let me ask you this
if you saw that closing argument
and you watched it for nine minutes and
you watched the lawyer talk normally
could you convict because that that
removes all the reasonable doubt
i mean it's just gone at that point
i would have done it all right there's a
study in israel israel is in the news a
lot
that they think aspirin may protect
against kovid
they thought you know there's some
evidence it does
andre's back house commented on that to
point out is a
low quality study and i wouldn't start
taking aspirin
because number one you know i usually
tell you
don't get your medical advice from me
but i'm actually going to give you
medical advice
right now don't start taking aspirin
unless you talk to your doctor
i feel that's safe right it feels like
that's safe medical advice
i used to take a baby aspirin every day
because for
i don't know decades i believe that the
science said
that it would protect you against
strokes or heart attacks or something
and so i'd take my little baby aspirin
every single day
the new science or at least the latest
thinking is there's no indication
whatsoever that
the aspirin is going to protect you from
any of that stuff
and it might have some negative effects
because aspirin is not exactly harmless
so i wouldn't trust anything about an
aspirin
study just in general but not that one
um here's an interesting thing to watch
i've been asking the question
who is the the conservative voice
now because trump himself is sort of uh
at the moment a little bit off the stage
coincidentally rush limbaugh passed
you would think of him as maybe the
dominant voice
in conservative politics so now the the
two
most dominant voices are out of the game
and i was watching as uh um tucker
carlson's show came on
immediately after the biden speech
and there's there's an interesting
phenomenon
you have to experience and maybe you did
you probably did
which is you watch the event yourself so
you're watching the biden speech or any
any other event
and then you're forming an opinion and
you're thinking oh i think this about it
or that about it
and then you see somebody like tucker
carlson
give you a very strong opinion and
a take if you will how quickly does your
sort of generic
forming opinion start to match
identically to tucker carlson's opinion
because it's the first thing you heard
while you were still trying to form your
opinion
and he is so certain when he speaks it's
one of the things he does well
he speaks with a kind of certainty that
is very persuasive
i felt you know i've told you before
that we don't make up our own opinions
on politics
you think you do but you don't
now i'm not saying that's a hundred
percent true
but it's close enough to 100 true that
you can treat it that way
meaning that whether you're on the left
or the right if you were to look at your
political opinion on
any topic you will be amazed and
surprised
that it matches whoever you watch on tv
the most
most of the time it just matches who you
watch on tv
and it's because your opinion was
assigned to you the people who are good
at expressing things
they express an opinion and then you
just adopt it it's like oh that's a good
way to think about it
that's my opinion now but watching
tucker carlson
assign opinions to fox news viewers in
real time
was sort of mind-blowing and i watched
that happen last night
because i wanted to see i was sort of
monitoring my own opinion to see
when it got formed to yeah because i was
i was feeling oh that's a sort of a
boring good biden speech
yeah he didn't hurt anybody didn't hurt
himself
got the job done and then as soon as i
turn on tucker it's a it's a
it's a dumpster fire and what he said
about fourth of july is crazy
i agree with him of course on the fourth
of july stuff um
but the other thing is that as
somebody's
saying in the comments part of what
makes tucker so powerful
is not just that other voices got
decreased
which is a big deal but that
he's really good like really really good
at his job
and he seems to be getting better and at
at his current age you know i'm not sure
you'd expect his
quality of production to just keep
getting better but it is right in front
of your eyes
i i think he's unquestionably
at his highest level of
quality as well as importance
you know his impact on the country so
i feel as if he he just became the guy
i feel as if you know if you've been
looking for who's the
the voice of the conservatives it feels
like it's him
it feels like it now not to say there
aren't other voices but
he does seem to have emerged as the the
prime voice
over in portland i guess there have been
nightly protests and
stuff for almost a year now um
and there i read that some portland
business owners are boarding up their
businesses because they're expecting
more trouble from
everything from the george floyd stuff
to who knows what
i thought to myself there are still
businesses in portland
why would you stay in portland if if
there were protests for a year
i know it seems like that would be long
enough to make other plans
but it's hard to move a business i know
but i can't believe there are any
businesses left
here's another compliment to the biden
administration you didn't see this
coming
pete bootage as the transportation
secretary is a really good choice
he's a really good choice i don't know
if you you remember but buddha judge's
background
is uh as a business consultant
i mean that was his first role and you
don't get the i
was at bain i think you worked for but
you don't get that kind of a job
unless you're just crackling smart and
you just came out of harvard usually
as he did but the the thing that makes
this perfect is that it's a purely
um it's an analytical job
oh mckinsey somebody's saying it was
mckinsey that's right so he was a
mckinsey
consultant but he has exactly the right
skill set
exactly the right skill set for uh
transportation and infrastructure
because those are things that people
sort of are more likely to agree on
right
we're a little bit closer on the need
for an infrastructure packs
package than we are for probably almost
anything else
he's perfect so you know i'm going to
give the biden administration a
an a-plus on that appointment we'll see
if he delivers
right he still has to deliver but that's
a perfect fit
of of training and competence
with job um you're the astrazenecas
vaccination some people thought it might
cause blood clots but now they've looked
at the data and they say
nope no blood clots so that story about
the vaccinations being a problem
is fake news as far as we know
there's still a lot of concern that
people will not get the vaccinations
because they're afraid of it or
mostly they're afraid of it and
i'm going to predict that in the end
that won't be a problem
my uh predictions last observation
is that um because supply is limited
that people's willingness to get the
shot is going to match the supply all
the way to the end
meaning that um you'll get enough people
vaccinated
to get to wherever we need to get people
like
me are quickly saying
they're skeptical until the last minute
you should stay skeptical until you have
a chance to get the shot
and then take all the information that
you have up to that point
and make your decision but you don't
need to make a decision until the shot's

something tells me that a lot of the
people who are sort of
talking about not getting the shot when
they really really think it through
and when they watch how many people have
gotten the shot and it doesn't you they
haven't heard that many stories of bad
outcomes
i feel as if um a lot of people are
going to get the shot
i think we'll get as many as we need i
think we'll be fine there
um here's my math question for you
and i asked this this morning i got a
number of answers
and i'm still not sure of my opinion on
it so help me form an opinion on it it
goes like this
if we had a normal virus that
affected everybody about the same way
every age group
then we're told that getting to 60 70
percent
herd immunity with vaccinations or
prior infections that getting there
would be enough
to stop the stop the spread
but what if you've got a weird virus
that has a special characteristic
that attacks let's say twenty percent of
the population
aggressively and eighty percent of the
population
hardly bothers them at all what happens
if you can vaccinate almost all of
that 20 percent well it won't stop
the infection from spreading through the
other 80 percent
of course and that other 80 percent if
they came in contact with the few people
who didn't have it yet
in that in the high risk group
then those people could get it and die
so
but here's the question i'm just trying
to think
the the logical math of it through
i do understand there's something uh
andres backhouse
said this morning on twitter that the
rate of infection
where it's been studied seems to be
fairly similar
with every age group i didn't know that
until this morning
so you can get infected at every age
group
which suggests that my idea doesn't make
sense
that if everybody's getting infected
it's at least in that one sense
it's like every other virus it's just
the outcomes are different
not the infection rate so
but i haven't given up yet
i feel as if just to help me think this
through because i really too many
variables here to
quite grasp it but my
my uh gut level uh
statistical intuition which is very
unreliable
tells me that if you vaccinate
let's say 80 percent of the high-risk
people
they tend to hang out with themselves
don't they
senior citizens are far more likely to
have you know extended
uh contact with other senior citizens
they do
have family contacts etc but and then
kids mostly hang around
with kids and under that scenario
couldn't you
not have heard immunity in the classic
sense where the virus just stops
but in a functional sense
where once you've got the high-risk
people done and the low-risk people are
still getting infected but
you don't care because they're not
getting any bad outcomes
don't you sort of reach something that's
like a virtual
herd effect
except plenty of people are still
getting infected it's just they're not
dying so when we talk about herd
immunity
from a regular virus we're talking about
the virus just stopping
it just can't spread it just stops but
maybe when we talk
about herd immunity for this one what we
should really be talking about is
bringing the
rate of risk down to whatever is a
baseline normal risk of life
and i feel like we're going to hit that
really soon
that's that's my uh statistical slash
math intuition that we're going to hit
it really soon
like way before may i'm thinking
i'm thinking april
uh hospitalizations will be almost
nothing
um but their spread will still be
widespread because the kids will
still be giving it to kids et cetera it
just won't we won't know about it
so i am not convinced that i'm right
there
and i'll let me make another point about
your skill stacks
when i when i advise you to add uh
additional talents to what you already
have to make your
stack of talents your talent stack as i
like to say is special
statistics is one of those things you
should have on there now i've taken a
course in statistics in in college but
it was a million years ago
i don't remember a lot of the math but
you
you can develop let's say a statistical
intuition about things
you can get to the point where you could
look at say this aspirin study
and say oh the number of people studied
was small the way they studied it is not
as as good statistically so you would
just have an intuition that you
shouldn't trust it necessarily
and i think that's a really good thing
to develop and you don't need to do all
the math to do it
just spend enough time looking at the
illusions of statistics the things that
you thought would be true
but turned out if you do the math are
not true every time you're fooled by
statistics make a little
note say oh yeah that's one of those
situations where it looks like it could
be the case
but if you do the math it's opposite so
develop try to develop some kind of like
intuition about where things are
credible and where they're not
independent of having the math
here's my most controversial idea of the
day
we know that china is sending fentanyl
to the cartels and the cartels are
packaging it up
in in other in drugs that look like
other kinds of drugs such as
fake xanax shipping it to the united
states and 50 to 70
000 americans per year are dying
from this we believe that china
is pursuing this you know total war idea
where it is completely intentional and
they could obviously stop it
because we've actually told them the
name of the person in china who's
sending the fentanyl
we know the name it's this guy
china of course can find that guy
right so there's no question about those
two facts
we've told them who it is who's the
you know the fentanyl kingpin in china
china knows where he is
they could stop him does anybody doubt
that they can stop that guy
no of course not so we have to assume
it's intentional
and that they are killing 50 to 70 000
americans per year
intentionally as a plan
now that's war isn't it
but given the nature of
all the obstacles and variables in the
world we can't just sort of
attack china militarily we just do this
weird thing where we demand that they
stop and then they just don't
because they don't have to apparently
there's no penalty
so to me it seems that mexico and the
cartels
are a combined allied
military force in a war
with the united states now we can't
attack
china because they have nukes and stuff
but we can certainly attack their ally
who holds territory and their allies
hold the
the border tele territory if you didn't
know this the cartels actually
are the government on the border
literally they're the government
the actual government wouldn't even be
they would be too afraid to even go
there
because they would kill the actual
government they're just not allowed
so for all practical purposes
mexico is not even on our border we
don't have a mexican border
but i'd like one let's see if we can get
one
so the way to get a mexican border for
the first time
is to get rid of this small let's say
unlabeled country owned by the cartels
different cartels but they have
different parts of it right and i think
that
we should at least consider
annexing that territory that mexico
doesn't control
now you would say to yourself whoa whoa
you've gone way too far the government
of mexico
is never going to allow you to annex
part of that territory to which i say
wouldn't that be great
wouldn't it be great if mexico surged
their
uh government military into that area to
protect it
from the united states annexing it
that'd be fine then we don't have to
annex it
because if the mexican military tried to
defend it
they would move their military into that
zone and that's all we wanted in the
first place
we want mexico to be on our border
so if mexico wants to be on our border
we'll help but of course the the real
mexican government is afraid of the
cartel
as they should be so they they can't
really do that
so what would they do if we just
annexed it just took it and said we're
not
taking it from mexico mexico doesn't own
it
and here's the best part if mexico wants
it back
they can have it just ask
all you have to do is control it just
move your military in
control the border we'll give it right
back to you
you can have it back but if you don't
want to do that
it's not mexico and it's not the united
states
it's china and i don't want a border
with china
right now we have one they happen to be
the cartel
working with china but for all practical
purposes
we just got ourselves a border with
china
and they are invading and attacking over
the border
so i would treat it like a chinese
military exercise
and when mexico complains you say oh i
hear you what you're saying
but it's not really about us this isn't
about the united states and mexico
we don't have any complaints with mexico
at all not the mexican government we
have a complaint with china
who is working with this cartel these
cartels who own this territory
this has nothing to do with you but if
you would like it to be about you
we would like that too you could join us
but until then it's it's war with china
and we'll just treat it that way
in the comments somebody says this idea
is so crazy it could work
let me tell you about uh so crazy it
could work
that's exactly right that's exactly
right
the the idea is not so much that you
would actually annex it
but you would change the frame you would
reframe the situation from an
immigration problem
a drug problem a crime problem because
that's not getting us anywhere
is it the way we cur we currently
frame and think about the border is
giving us nothing but worse problems
if you reframe how you think about it
that opens up options
you don't necessarily know where that
ends up it could end up with mexico just
defending their own border better
that'd be fine but the reframe just gets
you out of the
broken and bankrupt way of thinking
the bankrupt way of thinking is that we
have a crime immigration problem
at the border that's just not what's
going on what's going on
is that china is attacking the united
states right now
successfully and we're not defending
against an attack by china
mexico you're just not part of the
question
i wish you were honestly i wish you were
part of the question
but you're not the cartels are
all right um here's uh the most uh
this will just make your head spin for a
while i believe there's another
sexual category
and i'm just going to put this out there
and then you won't
you won't accept this at first but wait
till you look into it
okay some of you will be able to go home
immediately and ask somebody
for confirmation most of you won't
but watch watch what happens when you do
if you said to a let's say
a teenage girl in the united states in
2021
so it's just a your average teenage girl
and you say that teenage girl what is
your uh your orientation
they'll tell you they'll say i'm either
straight or i'm gay
or or i'm bi
and they'll tell you just right now so
at least in today's world
uh i don't see at least nothing like it
used to be
in terms of anybody saying that they're
gay or
they're lesbian or anything else so the
first thing
that would be eye-opening is that a
teenager today
is far more likely to just
you know be completely open about what
their sexuality
is here's the shocking part
ask a ask a girl who identifies as
heterosexual
not bisexual they have to identify as
heterosexual
and then ask this question would you
ever marry a woman
there was a time if you ask somebody who
identified as heterosexual would you
ever marry somebody of the same gender
they would have said well no what do you
think heterosexual means
that the whole point of heterosexual is
no i'm
i'm interested in the other gender
not today if you if you ask a teenage
girl today
would are you heterosexual she says yes
totally heterosexual
i'm not bi at all but would you marry a
woman
if you fell in love they will say yes
and won't even blink at it it's
it's kind of interesting it's it's
neither good nor bad i'm not putting any
kind of judgment on it
it's just a an evolution
that's sort of fascinating to watch
now i don't think that men would answer
the same i don't think a teenage boy
who identified as heterosexual if you
ask would you ever
marry another man probably would say no
you know in 2021 still probably not
everyone
but more more often
uh somebody's asking the question what
would happen if you asked a
let's say a teenage white girl
if she would marry a black person i've
i've heard teenagers discussing that
very question and 100
of them said yes and there were more
people who say they prefer
it in fact
several said they prefer it but i've
never heard anybody
in uh in the modern era say that they
wouldn't
i haven't heard it so i don't think
there's anybody
at least maybe this is a california
thing so it could be really different
where you live california tends to be
five to ten years ahead of some of these
things
um somebody says would you stay with a
spouse who changes
uh their gender i
think it depends it depends right
there's no there's no one answer to that
that would depend on the two people
uh when are you in the company of
teenagers well i don't hang with
teenagers
but uh let's say if you have a a family
situation
you're exposed to them whether you like
it or not
so the the answer is through family
connections
um but i'm not talking about
anybody in my family i'm talking about a
general statement
if you ask a personal question to a
group you'll get a peer answer yeah
yeah i think so
um yeah i'm just looking at your
comments
okay well i didn't know if that would be
surprising to many of you or not
it's a sign of the times probably a good
one
good sign of the times because the the
teens
the teens are definitely woke there's no
doubt about that
and that's not all bad
all right that's all for now and i'll
talk to you
later
all right um
your teens are not woke
all right that's all for now i will uh
talk to you tomorrow too
