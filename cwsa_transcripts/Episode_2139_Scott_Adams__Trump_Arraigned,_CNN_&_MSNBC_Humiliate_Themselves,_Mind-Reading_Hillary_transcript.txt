do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization and
your life especially
this will be the most amazing time
you've ever had probably oh I don't
think it'll ever be topped but if you'd
like it to go to the levels that
nobody's ever seen before all you need
is a cup of mugler glass I take your
Chelsea style the canteen Joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopa media of the day
the thing makes everything better with a
little bit of oxytocin today just a
little bit just a hint just just a taste
like all disciples if it happens now go
ah
so good well how many of you caught
Tucker Carlson's third episode on
Twitter it was a burner
boy is he good at this
it it's interesting to see Tucker
without any corporate control on his
on his speech
um I won't get into the details because
it was such a good thing you should just
watch the whole thing it's riveting the
whole way through
but uh the the basic idea is that the
military industrial complex has been
trying to kill Trump for a long time
or at least been trying to neutralize
them because Trump is the one who
doesn't want to spend a lot of money
conquering countries all over the place
for no good reason
and that's a big threat
as Tucker would tell you to the prophets
of a lot of people
so
I find it fascinating that he can just
say that directly and here's the thing
that's different about Tucker
Tucker actually lives and breathes
Washington politics
so when he says stuff like this it
doesn't feel like he's just making it up
it feels like this is just a report from
his personal experience of the people he
knows and the things he's seen himself
so it seems super incredible just
because of the access he has and it's
not the sort of thing you'd expect
anybody to lie about it'd be a weird lie
I mean so detailed
so I thought that was fascinating I
recommend it all right of course uh
Trump was arraigned yesterday we'll talk
about that in some detail uh the
funniest part about it was and I had to
wait I waited
until today because I didn't think this
was real
maybe it's not maybe maybe you can tell
me if this is real or not I think it's
real
but the Chiron on Fox
uh
well Biden was speaking said
want to be dictator speaking of Biden
want to be dictator speaks at the White
House after having his political rival
arrested
[Laughter]
did that really
I've seen the pictures and I've seen
incredible people tweet it but did that
really happen it was you saw it live
did some of you see it live
you saw live okay all right some of you
saw it live I guess I'll believe it now
how do you interpret that
does that look like a rogue employee who
is just having some fun and probably got
got in trouble later
maybe I don't know I mean it has that
feel of a prank like an internal prank
but here's what I hope it is
that this is this is a very unlikely
speculation but here's what I hope it is
I just hope it's this
I hope it was mocking uh CNN and MSNBC
I hope I hope it was I hope it was
sarcasm I hope that they were just doing
their version of the Ridiculousness that
the other side does on their chirons if
that's what they were doing
oh my God they nailed it
oh my god did they nail it
so I don't know what the story is I'm
just going to say that uh Fox News if
you can identify who did that Chiron
could you give him a big raise
just just a big old bonus because it was
the most interesting thing that that's
happened on the network in a little
while
it was awesome all right so I just hope
it was sarcasm or or a prank
um I would say more generally let me
test your temperature on this
uh as you know Rupert Murdoch owner of
Fox News has famously turned against
Trump in the past recent past and seems
to be more of a DeSantis guy and maybe
once the network to focus Less on Trump
Etc so that's that's what we knew to be
true
prior to this week
but if you were to watch the way Fox
News is covering the Trump arraignment
situation
I have a hypothesis
that Rupert Murdoch thinks that the
potential jailing of a presidential
candidate is to use my own term
too far
and it looks like it looks like maybe
one of two things has happened either he
is Unleashed Fox News to go hard at this
or the or the hosts and the people at
Fox News have just decided to say
you and they're going to go hard at it
anyway you know at risk of their jobs I
guess I don't know which one it is
if I had to guess I would say Rupert
Murdoch is like everybody else
who looks at this and says all right he
may have done something you don't like
you may have done something technically
illegal but this is too far
does it feel like that to you like like
there was a little change of something
over there at Fox News did you feel it
anybody well maybe you don't watch it
anymore because you're all mad at him
I I felt there's some kind of a shift
and I'm fascinated to know if it came
from the top or maybe just everybody you
know understands
same situation so nobody needs to talk
about it you know it could be that
nobody needed to talk about it because
it's just so obvious that you've you've
got to be against this
if you're leaning right in any way you
got to be against this
I mean the fact that all of the
challengers to Trump on the Republican
side I think every one of them
has come out against this
which is against their own self-interest
in a way
uh I don't think it is I think it is in
their best interest
to be straight about this but uh
I don't know looks like maybe Murdoch's
softening up on this maybe
anyway
um Trump did his little speech after he
was arraigned
and uh which is the other funny thing
about the Chiron is because it says a
political rival arrested he wasn't
arrested he was arraigned
it's a pretty big difference
but I love the fact that they called it
arrested because that's sort of what
you'd expect from the other team
all right
um
so Trump said Biden was the most corrupt
president in the history of the country
and
did I hear him promise that he would
investigate the bidens for their bribery
alleged bribery
situation
now
this is really high stakes isn't it
I I believe that Biden and Trump
have now created a situation in which
one of them has to go to jail
one of them has to go to jail
because if they don't take Trump out
he's going to be the president and he's
going to put them in a jail
or he's going to try pretty hard uh now
let me let me uh
put down a stake right here
I do not want to see a trump
Administration locking up any bidens
unless they really really have the goods
I mean you'd better you'd better really
have that locked up tight because it's
the same problem right I'm not
going to put up with Trump jailing his
opponents
I'm not going to put up with that they
better have the goods
they better have the goods or forget it
um because this works both ways I'm not
going to be political about jailing
politically presidential candidates you
know we got to have the goods
all right
um
now here's what I found interesting that
CNN did a fact check on this of course
Daniel Dale did a fact check on Trump's
speech after the arraignment and of
course you know he had lots of things to
say were not factual
but here's something that he didn't fact
check
here's the dog that's not barking at all
it's the size it's the most silent dog
in the world
I thought that Trump's primary defense
of his own actions was the Clinton sock
drawer defense
the the defense that Clinton had a bunch
of audio tapes they had taken from his
administration and that the legal the
legal uh opinion on that the way it
shook out was that the mirror removing
of them
proved that he considered them personal
and the president alone gets to decide
what's personal so the mere act of
removing them was enough to prove that
he meant them to be personal and
therefore there was nothing he had that
was not his personal possession
do you think that CNN fact-checked that
claim from Trump that the Clinton sought
your defense is a foolproof defense
nope that was not fact checked
think about that it also wasn't
mentioned
it wasn't mentioned
it wasn't mentioned
it it wasn't even mentioned
I mean you could also you could all
clearly see what's going on here right
there there's nothing like real news
happening there's nothing like real
Justice happening we're so far from
anything like real news and real Justice
this is the weirdest
cringy theater I've ever seen it's like
cringe theater all the way around the
way the news is handling it is totally
cringe really you can't even mention the
most important part of the story
CNN can't even mention the most
important part of the story which is his
defense
that that doesn't matter like that
doesn't count that's not somehow related
to the story or the fact checking
they can't do a fact check that says
he's right about this
oh yeah he's right about his defense
that seems like a pretty big point
doesn't it that his defense
is either right or wrong
that's crazy now what what they fact
jacked were his claims about what other
people did not including Clinton
but some other cases and I think he was
you know Hyperbole and just wrong on all
the other stuff but you know in his
usual way
directionally he was sort of
directionally right that presidents have
taken material forever
but not in the details of course
all right
Oliver Darcy
writes about Rachel Maddow on MSNBC she
was explaining why MSNBC did not choose
to show Trump's speech
and she said this and she said this
without embarrassment
and without any sense of irony
looked right in the camera and said the
following this is Rachel Maddow there is
a cost to us as a news organization
knowingly broadcasting untrue things
yeah yeah there would be a cost to a
news organization of knowingly
broadcasting untrue things
I wonder if nbm MSNBC has ever knowingly
broadcast
untrue things or are they so
stupid that they actually believe the
things they report
they believe that the president actually
called neo-nazi's Fine people
like in public
they actually reported that and they
believed that to be true
they believe that the president
suggested maybe drinking bleach or
injecting disinfected into your body
in public they believe that in public he
said that
of course not neither of these things
happened they thought that the president
of the United States was peeing on beds
in Russia and colluding with Putin
they reported it because they believed
it
did they did they believe that
do you really think there was no point
at which they said you know I don't
think any of this is true
but Rachel maddowell looked right at the
camera and said
no we didn't want to don't want to
knowingly broadcast on the untrue things
no he hurts our ability to do that if we
live broadcast
what we fully expect to be a Litany of
lies and false accusations yeah
wow
well let me tell you my bottom line on
all this Trump stuff I got a lot more to
talk about but here's my bottom line
um
CNN
is reporting and this is one of their
opinion pieces on CNN that Trump wants
to make the 2024 election all about
himself
you know not so much about the what the
country needs but he's trying to make it
all about himself and his his legal
issues what do you think of that
um what I think about it is that the
left is not reading the room right
let me explain the room
to the left
you made Trump us
we didn't do that I mean there were
people who you know loved him and had
cult-like support for him that was true
but you went way beyond that you just
turned him into us
he's being hunted because we're being
hunted and I mean me personally
definitely me personally but maybe some
of you as well
and whether any of that is a let's say
an accurate feeling of the world
when when I say you should read the room
I'm not saying that the people in the
room are being rational
I'm saying that they have a feeling
the room has a feeling which may or may
not be related to facts
but there's a Feeling
I'll tell you what the room feels like
it feels like they're the guy
that's us
he he just feels like me right now I've
never had that feeling before
because I I don't you know I don't have
a call like you know love for him in
that weird way
but somehow they made him me like I
honestly feel like he's me right now I
feel like I'm being arraigned I feel
like I'm at risk of going to jail
and when he says you know it's hyperbole
of course you know they're that he's
what's standing between them and the
rest of us that's not exactly true
but feels true
there's I don't think it's true I mean
not in a technical sense but it sure is
 feels true and if you're reading
this room wrong
you you need to get out of the game
if you can't see the mood in the room
you are not in the right business you
should not be in the news opinion
business at all
and if you're and if you're in the Bible
Administration if you don't know you're
juggling live hand grenades
maybe I should inform you you're
juggling live hand grenades and
you don't need to well maybe they do
need to because if they don't take Trump
out he's definitely going to take them
out or try
so they made it a fight to the death
instead of an election
and I mean fight to the death
because they're both at an age where
even the short jail sentence could be
the end of it right that's the life
sentence effectively
so how did we how did we allow this
how did we the citizens allow this to
happen that the two candidates are in a
death match and is actually death
it's actually life and death
how do we get there
the news of course yeah the news is
illegitimate and that's how we got here
it's MSNBC it's CNN it's New York Times
it's Washington Post it's the
illegitimate fake news that actually
changed our system from an election to
who can kill the other one first
that's what we're watching it's a death
match
and they created that that's that's
completely a news
creation
now I'm sure Fox News does their part
too right we're not going to let the the
political write-off off the hook the
news the news collectively has created
this situation
and social media of course
um
here's something I do like about social
media it's all the fact checking we do
on these people John Bolton was
complaining about uh Trump and his
secret documents but it took only about
a minute for Joel Paul Joel Pollock uh
writing for Breitbart to say that Bolton
was investigated by the doj in 2020 for
using classified information in his book
without authorization
dog even tried to seize the prophets
from his book uh funny the Biden dog
dropped the whole thing
so it's pretty hard to be anybody in
power
and to blame anybody else for having you
know secret documents because it turns
out every one of them does it
is basically just a universal the the
only thing that Trump did that was
different
is he had more boxes
it just said more but it was the same it
looks like all the same stuff they're
all doing and As Trump pointed out a lot
of those boxes you saw in the
photographs remember the picture of the
boxes in the bathroom at Mar-A-Lago
that was a very devastating photo
but Trump says who says that those are
full of secrets
which is a really good point all we know
is that there were boxes there it was
literally just a picture of boxes it
wasn't like the only things he took were
secrets he took photographs you know
some of them are just full of
photographs
so the fact that the way that was
presented to us is the assumption that
every one of those boxes had classified
documents of it and it was stored in a
bathroom
it's possible that there wasn't one one
secret thing in any of those boxes
you have it already the way right have
you heard anybody say and the picture of
these boxes in the bathroom we've looked
through them and sure enough there were
some classified things in there did you
ever hear that story
no because nobody knows what's in the
boxes
the fact that the fact that they show
those boxes without telling you if
there's anything in there of evidentiary
value
tells you that this is not a legitimate
process
even by the prosecutors and the people
who are supposed to be the legitimate
ones in the game yeah the rest of us
don't have that obligation to be too
legitimate we're just talking about it
but the people who are in the process
the ones tasked with making sure whether
we find Justice they printed a picture
of a bathroom full of boxes and didn't
tell you if any of it
was related to the case
any of it there was not a claim that
even one box had a secret of it no
there's no claim
I didn't see one anyway did you
so
it's it's just jaw dropping the amount
of impropriety of this going on it's
it's almost it's almost stuns you into
inaction it's just too much
it's like you don't even know what to do
after a while there's just so many
things wrong you don't even know which
direction to get mad at
that's how it feels
um
all right
Nancy mace who's rapidly becoming one of
my favorite politicians Republican uh
representative uh she tweeted this she
said just in case anyone is confused
what is uh what is really what this is
really about this is the President Biden
last November
now last November is not very long ago
right just a few months ago
and last November Biden said in public
at some event
quote I'm making sure Trump under
legitimate efforts of our constitution
does not become the next president again
that's an interesting way to put it
isn't it
why do we say it that way
you know wouldn't it be let's say if it
were a political statement you'd expect
it to sound more like I'll make sure
that I win
or we have to make sure we win so he
doesn't get back in office
something like that
but this sounded a lot like a dictator
who was just taking on his competitor
um
anything about what he has because it's
classified yeah Carpe Dante was pointing
out this is this is the perfect summer
hoax
so I said the same when I was pointing
out I was predicting actually before
before this heated up I was predicting
that this would be our summer hoax about
Trump because it's a slow news time as
the perfect Oaks as carpi points out
that because we can't see the documents
cancel the documents do you know what
else is interesting about this
that we I think at this point we know
enough about what did and did not happen
that the legal people who are weighing
in on it
uh have enough information that they
probably have a pretty good handle on
which way this should go
and they disagree
just think about this the top legal
experts in the country because it's such
a big issue you know the most important
high power most capable people are on TV
talking about you got your dershowitzes
and your turlies and you know the people
who may have a different opinion as well
and
here's what I see in their conversations
on TV on the news and online
correct me if I'm wrong
the greatest legal Minds in the country
can't tell if a law was broken
true or false
the best legal minds of the country
can't tell if a law was broken or not
now
some might say there was a technical law
broken but unless you've adjudicated
that whole Clinton sock drawer angle you
know the precedent that says they taking
it out of the White House is all it's
all takes if you take it out of the
White House there you go
now I'm also wondering about the
timeline
did Trump remove from the White House
things after inauguration and therefore
he wasn't president so he couldn't do
anything is that part of the argument
is it part of the argument that he
didn't move the boxes out of the white
house until he was technically out of
office but he was just doing the moving
is that not part of it or is it or it is
I saw that today and I was like what
that's the first I've heard that
somebody's saying true
so that that might be that might become
part of the the issue just the the
technical timing but here's my larger
point
this is the United States of America
in my opinion we have you know two or
three huge advantages on much of the
rest of the world some of it is
geography we just got really lucky you
know where America is situated in terms
of close to you know just where it is
and that we have natural resources and
stuff like that so that that's pretty
lucky
but the thing that we just do right
that makes us in my opinion the most
important country in human civilization
is that our legal system usually works
everything else flows from that if you
don't get the legal system right
nothing else is going to work you know
then corruption takes over it all falls
apart you turn into Russia pretty
quickly so
so that's like our our special thing and
it's a special thing that you could
easily do wrong and you can imagine us
drifting into doing it wrong because it
looks like that's what's happening
uh you know crime in the city used and
then this situation it's looking like
our
our historical ability to get at least
Justice
mostly right that's a little bit in
Jeopardy at the moment
so that's a pretty big deal but let me
ask you this question
and you don't have to be a lawyer right
so you could take off your lawyer hat
now you're just a citizen of the United
States
you're now a representative of that
theme
that we get just as right most of the
time you know nobody's perfect but we're
going to get it right and not only are
we going to get it right but the
citizens are going to make sure
it's right
that's what a jury is a jury is the
citizens making sure it's right not just
observing we don't just observe
we're not observers we are part of this
system
right and let me tell you let me lay
down
a uh a line that can't be crossed in our
system the following line cannot be
crossed and the citizens have to make
sure it doesn't happen
if the most qualified experts in the
world can look at all of the information
about a situation this document thing
and they disagree on whether a crime has
even been committed
that's the end of the conversation
that needs to be the end of the
conversation you don't even bring that
trial
if you can't even get legal people to
agree and they do know the information
right now it could here's where here's
where I'll put one caveat on this if
there's something we don't know yet
well that could be why the opinions are
different
but it looks like we're closing in on
knowing everything that needs to be
known in order to judge it as legal or
illegal
and it looks like people who disagree
and even if they do agree that there
might be a technical violation
it looks like they completely disagree
about whether that's a chargeable
logically you'd want to do that for the
good of the country
under under this situation of extreme
extreme ambiguity about whether a law
has even been broken
at the same time that we see no victim
no victim so we're not sure a law has
been broken
we're sure there's no victims that have
come forward
and we don't even know what's in the
boxes and we won't know what's in the
boxes
how does this have to end
not not not
where you uh
predict it will end not where you know
all the Badness you think will shake out
you tell me where it has to end
it has to end before trial
it has to or in some kind of a jury
acquittal right this has to end
with Trump being free of the charges one
way or the other you know I saw Rachel
Maddow say that the judge can do a
pocket veto
uh meaning sort of procedurally
just delay it or or say it doesn't be
some standard and you know not accept it
and just sort of make it go away in a
judgy way however judges have the power
to do that maybe
but I'll tell you what can't happen
you can't put a president of our country
in prison
for evidence the public can't see
because it's classified
on a case that our best legal experts
are completely all over the place
and we so there's ambiguity of whether
there was a victim ambiguity of whether
there was even a crime
and
it's the person who might be the next
president and was a prior president
under those conditions
that's a hard no
so as a citizen of the United States I'm
telling you you're not putting
him in prison
you're not
it's just not going to happen
because we're not going to let it
because if he goes to prison
I'm sorry
it's too far
too far
and the fact that the the news is even
treating this like it's a jump ball like
this could go either way no it can't go
either way
let me be as clear as this as I can the
legal system might do anything
unpredictable I don't know what the
legal system is going to do but I'm
telling you the citizens are done
it's going to go one way he's not going
to prison
he's not going to prison it's just not
going to happen
we won't let that happen
all right
um
those are some more fact checking here
from Daniel Dale comparing it to the
Clinton email case and let me tell you
why those are so different so so oh so
different completely different
here's why
uh facts first is from Daniel Dale CNN
this is an inaccurate and self-serving
comparison this is Trump comparing his
situation to Hillary's email
investigators saw problems with how both
Trump and Clinton handled classified
materials okay so so far it's similar
because investigators saw that they both
had some issues with the classified
materials so so far the same but there
are several key differences between the
cases all right key differences these
are Big all right for starters Trump
mishandled uh far more material right so
apparently the quantity of material
determines whether it's murder so like
if you were to murder one person
that wouldn't be murder so much as
somebody who murdered three people
because three people is a lot of murder
but one person
yeah one person murdered how much of a
murder is one person
compared to a whole crowd
so that's a big difference there was a
volume difference and you know the law
certainly cares about that
um
when it comes to Secrets
do you think volume is how you measure
that
do you think one guy one guy's got a a
box of Secrets
and somebody else just has one document
so the box is worse than the one
document right right the one document
that gives away our nuclear secrets
that's nothing compared to a whole box
there's a whole box of things
did I tell you there's a whole box
whoa more than one box we got boxes upon
boxes so therefore that's worse because
if there's one thing I can tell you
about classified information you measure
it by the Box
buy the Box yeah it's not by how
important it is
not by how critical the secret is or how
much damage it could do the United
States or how many people could be
killed not important how
are the fact Jack but it gets better
um
also Daniel says Trump was charged with
knowingly breaking the law
and obstructing the investigation while
the FBI concluded that Clinton didn't
act with Criminal Intent
huh
so according to Daniel Dale who knows
what Trump knows
when Trump says taking it out of the
White House was perfectly legal
because it's my private stuff I just
made it private
that even though he says that and even
though it makes perfect sense compared
to you know precedent with Clinton and
it's completely logical and makes sense
what Daniel Dale knows is that he was
lying
so even though what he said makes
complete sense
and it's true
Daniel Dale can read his mind and
although there are no statements from
Trump to suggest this nothing written
nothing reported
Daniel Dale can look into his mind and
see that he knew he knew yeah he knew
that he didn't have access to these
but it goes further than that he doesn't
just read uh Trump's mind uh you said
there that there was not quote clear
evidence that Clinton quote intended to
violate laws
she did she didn't intend
so when when they used hammers to
destroy their phones
uh
that was not intended to hide any
evidence
I mean why would you even think that
like where would you even get that sure
they were looking for evidence and they
were asking for it and we destroyed it
with hammers but why would you think
that was some kind of like obstructive
thing as crazy of you right
no so they read her mind and found out
it was no problem
but they read his mind at all oh my god
did you see the things in his mind
so CNN literally can write some
fact-checking about them
reading their minds
and they and they just print it Like
It's News
here's some more news
we got our mind reader on this our best
mind readers working on this
all right um
all right
let's see erasmussen has a poll
uh I'm not going to look up and it's
because I know that my uh viewers are so
smart that they already know the results
of the poll before I even tell them the
topic
is probably screaming across the screen
right now
and you are within one one point of the
percentage that is correct and the
question is this according to Rasmussen
um and talking about the likelihood of
cheating
uh in a in election what percentage of
people
think that the next election cheating is
unlikely unlikely
well no let me say what percentage
consider it not at all likely
you did it again
amazing
24 of likely voters say that election
rigging is uh not at all likely
well that's not at all likely
24 percent
so we got that
uh Starbucks is getting a little heat
for allegedly but I don't think it's
true uh taking down their pride month
displays early before the entire month
is over
uh now Starbucks corporate headquarters
says nothing like that is happening so
apparently none of it's true at least in
terms of a corporate there are no
corporate orders to do that
it does appear that it might be true in
individual stores because individual
managers have decided okay two weeks is
enough uh you know maybe they maybe they
have customers who are complaining
so there might be individual stores that
are making some individual actions but
uh
so far Starbucks is safe from
uh any boycotts and that probably keeps
them safe
so this is the best rumor this Starbucks
could ever have
is sort of a perfect situation because
the corporate office can say probably
honestly that no we didn't order this
because if they did there'd be a you
know a document or something we'd know
it pretty soon so I don't think they did
I think they didn't order it but at the
same time there's this rumor that that
they're backing down from the pride
stuff and they're taking you down early
which would make the conservative say oh
that's exactly what I wanted you to do
so now they'll go buy coffee
so they've got a story for both sides
you know for the for the left they could
say we no we did pride month nothing's
changed and for the right they can say
oh yeah we yeah we listened to you and
we took it down
so they went both ways
and I don't know what's true
I saw a tweet today by uh
razi becan
who's an interesting follow on Twitter
if you want another follow
a little more provocative than most but
you might like what he has to say uh and
he said he was at a party recently he
was talking to a 28 year old Dev I guess
that's a software development person
and kids came up the idea of having kids
he's got a few of himself and he asked
her if uh she and her boyfriend had
thoughts of having kids
and she said no and she gave three
reasons
why she doesn't want to have kids
number one climate change
number two overpopulation
number three she loves to travel
she loves to travel having kids would be
hard for that and received tweets uh
when I pointed out that number three
conflicted with number one she ignored
me
so number three she loves to travel but
she's also worried about the climate
so she wants to not have children so
that she could use up all of her climate
credits traveling
and then but then number two is even
funnier over a population
who believes that we're overpopulated
we don't even have replacement level
population in in America we have America
has one of the best
uh population stability situations
compared to other European or yeah other
Western westernized countries I guess uh
in that we're not going down as fast
but most most of the big countries are
not at replacement I mean China is is
estimated to go from like 1.3 billion
down to 700 million in next few decades
we have a population collapse problem
that might be calamitous
we don't have a population you know uh
over a population problem in some you
know there's some Pockets that are
overpopulated but generally speaking we
need more people not fewer especially in
America and so here's somebody who's uh
understanding of the world is so poor
that she's going to travel
to help the climate or so or something I
know not exactly that but it feels like
that
so that's the quality of a software
developer is 28 years old that's that's
that person's understanding of the world
imagine making decisions
that are vital to the survival of our
civilization which is having children or
not
and traveling or not and climate and all
that these are the most important
decisions to our future civilization
and there's a 28 year old who doesn't
know anything about any of these topics
just completely clueless about all of it
and yet has to make individual decisions
you know that sum up to the whole
all right
what else is happening here
um
do you think that Trump has set up a
mutually assured destruction situation
with the bidens it's not quite that but
Trump said he's basically going to take
down the bidens when elected
and it looks like he's got enough
material with these bribery allegations
that he could at least get a special
prosecutor that doesn't mean that
anything is guilty but we have
additional uh accusations about the
bidens today
that apparently on the Biden's Joe
Biden's 2017 tax returns
uh he has some kind of entity called
Celtic Capri Corporation
and it has 10 million dollars of Revenue
that's unspecified
he had 10 million dollars of unspecified
Revenue
in 2017.
do it do I need to say anything else
about that
10 million dollars of unspecified
Revenue
now I think I think you tried to sell it
as book advances
book advances but if it was book
advances why not just put a line there
book advances
there you go
uh I feel like you would probably
itemize
10 million dollars worth of income by a
line item
10 million is a lot to have as just a
well I don't know 10 million dollars
showed up
don't have to tell you where
I don't know if he legally has to
probably not I don't think he legally
had to say the details of it but uh
I feel like we need to know
I feel like we need to know it's a
little sketchy
um but it could have it's also possible
it was his book it's possible it was his
book stuff that's possible
do you think it's uh do you think he
gets that much for a book because uh how
many people buy it
uh do you think somebody would pay do
you think a publisher would pay I don't
know five seven ten million dollars for
a book
of bidens
how many how many books do you think
Biden would sell
all right I don't see any world in which
a publisher would pay that much for his
book
because there's no way it's going to
sell a lot of copies it would just be a
loss of Millions
so there's something going on with
publishing that I don't fully understand
but I feel like publishing might be a
way that they launder money
am I wrong
it's like somehow the publisher the
publisher gets some windfall over here
and then they've got a little extra cash
to give you know Joe a windfall over
here
but those two things are not connected
by any logic it's just oh how lucky
how lucky that a a major Democrat bought
a billion of our books for for their
organization or something like that I'm
just making that up but I feel like this
is how money gets laundered at the high
end
oh your book deal is going to be 25
million dollars even though we expect to
make one million dollars in Revenue
Scott's just jealous because Hunter is a
better artist you know what's funny
about that Hunter is a better artist
Hunter's not a bad artist
but I mean can't we give him that
we could give him that can't we he's not
a bad artist
he's pretty good
I don't take that as an insult at all
but nice try
so
Schiff
there's a motion in the house of
resolution
to censor Adam Schiff for his lies about
what was in the skiff and his lies about
the Russia collusion thing now of course
Chef is just using it as fundraising and
probably nothing will happen but
if you can't get censured
for trying to overthrow the government
of the United States by making up a lie
which has been determined to be a lie
what can you be censored for
would you have to actually murder
somebody what's the point of even having
Accenture
if this doesn't qualify for Accenture
like what's what would ever be censored
why do you even have it I can't even
imagine anything more perfectly suited
for a century
because it's not like he doesn't even
lose his job
all it is is you know a recognition that
this wasn't cool
and given that nobody thought it was
cool I don't think
seems like a slam dunk but I don't think
it'll pass
all right
um
and I so also from Joel Pollock and
Breitbart that the New York Times
published a profile of Hollywood star
Cheryl Hines as you know she's married
to RFK Jr
and they're blaming her for a quote
normalizing
RFK Jr
so the idea is that since she's a
recognized Hollywood figure
and has a good reputation you know
there's no negatives about her that I'm
aware of uh that she would sort of make
her husband look more normal
um
yes that's exactly what it does
that's exactly what it does but where's
the problem with that
why is that a story
you know shouldn't the story be
let me let me give you a different way
that the story could have been written
a lot of people think that RFK Jr uh is
a nut job because of you know
vaccinations or whatever whatever is the
current thing about him but
he obviously married this uh this woman
who is normal
and if she married him
she probably looked into all that stuff
so if the person who knows him best
his wife
who is willing to think oh yeah you're
you're not only are you normal but
you're so normal I want to marry you
live the rest of my life with you
is that normalizing him
yes yes it is
is that a problem
is that a problem is it a problem that
somebody can find a normal wife
I would say that would in fact be a
that's very much a point in his favor
wouldn't you say that if if a perfectly
normal person
can look into it and all the detail that
she must have about him that we don't
have and then at the end of it she says
yeah I want to marry you
shouldn't that be telling us that he's
doing something right
and somehow they turned it into this
weird negative where if your wife loves
you it's a problem
yeah am I taking that too far are they
basically saying it's a problem because
his normal wife loves him
therefore that might make you think he's
normal
you know I have to admit that I was
deeply in the camp of thinking he was a
nut job until recently
yeah right so I'm a reformed
reformed critic
and I didn't realize the extent to which
the mainstream media was
I just assumed if everybody's saying
that about him it just it just felt like
everybody was saying that but it was the
mainstream media the mainstream media
funded by the people who are his enemies
big Pharma
so my current view is that I doubt he
was right about everything he's ever
said
would you give me that
I doubt he was right about every claim
he's ever made because he's made some
pretty big claims
but I'll bet some of them are right
and I know he's right about the biggest
part of the claims which is the a lot of
things were not tested at the level that
you and I thought they were tested that
part seems to be totally right
and that's a big deal and it's really
valuable in my opinion that he's
bringing it up I think it's also really
valuable that he's bringing up the cia's
bad behavior in the past and he
allegedly probably killed his uncle
um who knows about his father
and
I I think that he's a mixed bag
meaning I think he got something wrong
and I think he got some right
but he's also very reasonable
and if the data shows he got something
wrong I think he would just go with it
and say yeah I got that wrong let's move
on
so he doesn't look like a to me he
doesn't look like a crazed
you know ignore the data you know I'm
just afraid of something kind of guy it
looks like he follows the data and I
think the date has been a little
ambiguous
but I don't think he's not following
David
all right
uh there's a story that showed a Russian
soldier uh surrendering to a drone a
Ukrainian drone
so apparently there was this little
little group of Russian soldiers that
had been spotted spotted in kind of open
territory and the ukrainians were just
sending I don't know if it's the same
drone or multiple drones over the little
ones just to drop a drop grenades on
them
and there was just basically nothing
they could do these drones were just
gonna follow them around and drop
grenades on them until they're all dead
so one of the guys on the ground is
surrendered to the Drone
like he looked up the driveway and he
was like signaling you know stop we we
surrender somehow
and
and then the Drone I don't know
captured him or something I don't know
what happened after he surrendered but
that was the story so I think
I think it was a story because it might
be the first time somebody surrendered
to a drone
but don't you think you'll see a lot
more of that
because as the drones get a little more
sophisticated don't you think they'll
just offer a surrender option
uh hello Russian soldier
we are above your location
uh you cannot run away there's no place
to hide
we will be dropping hand grenades on you
unless you surrender if you choose to
surrender put your weapons down we're
watching you right now and March it
Westward with your hands up
I I feel like that's what it will be in
the future right because once once the
Drone had the drop on them the soldiers
knew they they didn't have a defense
but it's also interesting that the Drone
was high enough up that they didn't
think they could shoot at it
because I didn't see them even trying to
shoot at it they were just running and
hiding
those were helicopters not drones
no if we were helicopters and there was
directly over them they would have been
shooting at the helicopter
That Couldn't that couldn't have been
helicopters
in my opinion it could not have been all
right ladies and gentlemen that is the
conclusion of my prepared remarks did I
miss anything
uh shooting at a helicopter is not a
good idea well it is if the helicopter
is trying to kill you
Slaughter meter it's a little too early
oh my God yeah I just saw a mention of
Tom Brady did anybody see the video of
Tom Brady knocking a drone out of the
sky with one with one throw of a
football
did you see that that was just the most
crazy thing I've seen a few videos of
him you know being insanely accurate
with the football
but I don't know what the the setup was
for what show or whatever but they had a
drone that was flying off off a boat
so Tom Brady's on the boat and they give
him the football and they ask him to
knock the Drone out of the sky
now the Drone was low enough you know
they you didn't have to throw it way up
but it was a drone it's like a little a
little drone that's like two feet square
and and he just knocked that freaking
thing out of the sky with one throw
it was probably the most impressive
thing you'll ever see an athlete do the
rest of your life and I thought how
often could he do that
was it just luck he hit it on the first
try
it was just insane to watch it yeah that
was very cool
yeah maybe it was CGI who knows
who knows
yeah well uh Thomas Massey read read
what was it the uh
he was offering to read the FBI document
that alleges the
bribery of the bidens
is that what he said he could read in
Congress because it's legal to read it
but it's not legal to have it
or something like that he can't he can't
show it to you but he can read it to you
in Congress there's some weird rule like
that he was teasing he might do that
or you could read it into the record
uh
Narcan every household
R.I.P your son what
okay I don't get that but
um let me tell you something about
Narcan that I learned the other day
all right this is very important allow
me to save some lives all right so you
all know that if you have Narcan you
might be able to save somebody who's
having a fentanyl overdose
and I guess you just spray it up their
nose or something here's what you need
to know
from somebody who's in that life
a person told me
privately
it often takes two to three narcans to
revive somebody
did you know that
it works very well
but sometimes the first one doesn't work
and it might not work because maybe
you're not good at administering it like
you might not quite execute it right
so if you're if you're a police officer
and you show up with a Narcan you
probably have a few extra
because you might you might come up
against a scene where there's a party
situation and three people are you know
down at the same time
so the police are usually set you know
they're going to have an extra
but if you just bought one for your
house in case your neighbor needs it
think about three
just think about three I know it's
expensive
but I just need you to know that there's
at least anecdotally the first one
doesn't always work and it is life and
death
so think about three
just think about it I'll just put that
out there as my public service
um
how does Ukraine figure into my theory
that hot Wars will become increasingly
rare
well it seems like every Hot War
is proving that we shouldn't have
another one
but you could argue that was true since
World War one right that was the the
ward end all wars
so
I do think that this war is this weird
fall of the rules kind of fight
where people are trying to do things
according to the you know the rules of
military action and that's why it's
staying at least localized
so the fact that it's localized and is
not creating yet a World War uh might be
a step in the right direction
but it doesn't make sense to have wars
that nobody can win
so I think you're going to see that the
the Ukraine Russia thing ends up with a
war that nobody won
so that would be to my theory that once
you realize you can't win a war anymore
there just is no winning
then you don't do it now an exception
would be the Middle East where there's
not really governments in some areas you
know you're you're battling
the terrorists and their little groups
and stuff now that that might still be
worth doing for a long time
because that's more like maintenance or
mowing the lawn
but in terms of two countries putting
their tanks on the battlefield and
attacking each other across the border I
think Ukraine and Russia are the proof
that it doesn't work anymore
so
and I think you would also have to say
we did everything wrong
or we did everything to cause this this
didn't happen on its own this was the
United States acting poorly for a long
time to just force this into being yeah
this this isn't the the avoidable fight
that you know if things had gone a
little differently maybe we wouldn't be
in a war this was somebody trying to
start a war as hard as they could and
then finally they got one
so
it doesn't feel like a normal War
in fact I would argue that the news is
already starting to shift its coverage
from a war to a negotiation I saw that
today on CNN I think there there was a
reference to that the ukrainians were
trying to capture some territory with
their counter-offensive to have a
stronger negotiating position
just think about that
so this is the news just
matter-of-factly
framing it as improving their
negotiating situation
in other words the war is over
the war is over
there's not going to be a military
conflict or there's not going to be a
nuclear conflict and the reason there's
not going to be a nuclear conflict
the war is over
we are in advanced negotiations right
now and a lot of that looks like who's
gonna you know have a beat on maybe
Crimea or something but basically this
is the the violent negotiation part of
the war there there's no longer a Hope
on either side of something like victory
victory is off the table
it's just a negotiation now a very bad
one
all right uh YouTube I'm going to say
goodbye for now and I'm going to stick
around talk to the locals people because
they're special
and I'll see you in the morning
best live stream ever
