well
wow this is going to be the best
coffee with scott adams of all time no
doubt about it
it's the first time i tried to talk
today it's not going well
but it's going to get better so
i've been traveling and not doing a lot
of sleeping
so i just stayed up all night last night
and
today i'm ready to go i'm going to
adjust my
adjust my time zone a little bit
and here we go now
i want to warn you about what's coming
there's going to be an embedded
micro lesson on determining your level
of awareness
some of you might not like it but the
magic here
is that the stories we're going to start
with are all going to build toward that
point
watch it happen it's going to be like
magic later i'll pick out
the the micro lesson and publish it
individually on
the locals platform because subscribers
of locals get
a little bit extra
now before we begin would you like to do
the simultaneous sip yeah
pretty sure you would and all you need
is a cup of micro glass i think you're
jealous dying the canteen jugger flask
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it happen
now go
let me tell you as much as i enjoyed
this trip
it was to santorini greece
i love being back in america
so it turns out i really like this
country and i like being in it
and being back on american soil
feels really good so let me tell you
some stories
um number one the jet blue terminal
at jfk yesterday was more packed
than i've ever seen any terminal ever
i mean it was just a crush of people you
couldn't get near anything you couldn't
tell that there was a line it was just a
this mass of people and
you know there have been some
predictions that there'll be this rubber
band effect
all the people who couldn't travel last
year you know they're going to double up
and start traveling like crazy
now i know that american airlines
actually canceled
flights because they couldn't get enough
employees
so the airports are not working at what
i would call 100
efficiency but boy is there demand
so jetblue was just through the roof
yesterday
literally i've never seen an airport
that packed
and and honestly it was a little
difficult
not just getting things done which was
also difficult
but the the psychological impact
of being in a in a massive crowd after a
year of social isolation
it's it's hard it's actually just
psychologically hard
not in a medical sense you know i wasn't
worried about anything medically i'm all
vaccinated blah blah but just um
the social experience
of being surrounded by people
was pretty intense and it's going to
take a little while for us to work our
way
back into the social head
well here is another reason to miss
president trump i think this is real by
the way
somebody tell me if this is fake news
but i believe he actually put out a
press release on father's day
saying happy father's day to all
including the radical left
rhinos and other losers of the world
hopefully eventually everyone will come
together
now there's just nobody else in the
world who can be this
interesting this consistently
so i'm seeing some confirmations that is
real
uh he i swear i swear
trump doesn't know how to be
uninteresting
you know after years of being
interesting both good and bad i suppose
you could say
he just doesn't know how to turn it off
he's just perpetually interesting
no matter what you think of him but i
love the fact
that he could put out a statement like
this and it's barely news
let's see oh interesting robert's asking
me how many
precursors for the talent stacks and
system stuff is in
ancient greece i don't know
um i i'm not aware of any precursors but
one assumes that not
every idea is original right
there there's always there's always some
precursor
um the panda tribune
if you're not following that account on
twitter you should the panda tribune
the the handle there is at panda tribune
and you tweeted at me uh
a video of my face superimposed over
chuck norris doing a bunch of martial
arts
and and here's the thing it's really
convincing
for a relatively low-tech um
you know i'm sure it was a low-tech
relative to you know say hollywood and
cgi
and it's pretty convincing if you didn't
know
that my face had been you know
substituted for
chuck norris it would kind of look like
it was really me so how close are we to
being completely fooled by a video
we're there we're at the point where the
fake video
can be created by you know people who
just have access to
ordinary equipment and it's going to
look real
how long before you don't need to hire
real actors for movies we're there
we're there you already don't need real
actors you could
simulate them except for obviously
getting sued for doing it
but technically there's nothing to stop
you from doing it right now
now i told you that each of these
stories
is building to a larger point we're
building to the micro lesson
you won't see yet how they they fit
together but
but watch me uh pull this mosaic off
all right larry kudlow is saying that uh
biden gave up energy uh sovereignty
american energy sovereignty and you know
the argument here is that agreeing to
the paris climate
accords is going to be in closing
pipelines and not drilling in alaska
and doing a bunch of things that trump
would have aggressively done
but biden is pulling back on now
here's the reframe on this that i think
needs to happen
whoever has the best energy policy
is sort of going to be the winner in the
in the world of economics and power
and even defense so when we think of
this
uh energy programs and we think about
being more green we really need to think
of this as a national security issue
because the richest country pretty much
wins the wars
right one way or another they either buy
off people or they
bribe people or they have a better
military but the richest country wins
pretty consistently and if you don't
have
a robust energy industry you're probably
not going to be that country forever
so the energy being the probably the
main
component of a good economy that plus
tech i would suppose
but if you don't have energy sovereignty
you're really given up a lot
militarily and we don't talk about it
that way
so here's an example where the way you
look at it
can completely change what you think is
important
if you're looking at it as climate
change well you know
then biden's got an argument you could
disagree with it
but it's an argument if you look at it
as a
homeland protection issue there's no
argument
as soon as you say this is also
self-defense
we're done you need the best energy
program that you can get for
self-defense
that one's not debatable
now i suppose you could say if you're a
nuclear power you've always got that
option but you don't want to
you know you don't want to be talking
about that option
all right here's a way to know that your
opinions are
assigned to you as opposed not you
necessarily specifically but that the
public's opinions are assigned to them
and here's a classic perfect example of
that
so apparently as
m hackman tweeted the the number of
unaccompanied
kids um in cbp custody border custody
is at a thousand forty the highest has
been since april 27th
so we've got over a thousand kids in
custody
at the border how big of a story would
that be
if trump were president well
it's a big story either way right so i
think we would agree
yeah it's a it's a national headline
either way
but it's not really even close to the
same amount of energy
right the energy that the news would be
putting into the story
if trump was behind it would be
hair on fire the energy that's put into
the story
with biden in charge it's a
let's mention it now here's a here's
some data
here's here's some statistics
this is this is really uh clear evidence
that your opinions are assigned to you
because if your opinions were not
assigned to you it would look the same
regardless who the president was all
right so
are you seeing the mosaic coming
together yet you will in a minute
um so adam a user on twitter
named adam asked me this question today
he says is there any scenario
where the intelligence agencies don't
run the government
from the shadows eventually
is there any possibility that
intelligence agencies don't end up
controlling the government and my answer
was
not in the long run in the long run they
have to
it's basically guaranteed
in the long run because they would have
the tools to do it
they would have the motivation to do it
perfectly within their
um you know within their mission to keep
the country
safe as they see it so there's a lot of
subjectivity in it as to what is morally
right and what is just
common sense and what is just a smart
way to
manipulate the public and what is just a
good sensible way to influence topics
you know is there's a very fine line
between a sensible way to influence a
topic
and just controlling the government from
your intelligence agencies
so given that the intelligence agencies
have the motivation
and the tools and here's the important
part
lots of different people involved so if
somebody tries to influence the
government and it doesn't work and they
get
caught or outed or fired there's always
somebody else
so sooner or later the intelligence
agencies are going to
peck away at the you know the levers of
government
until they own it because they know how
and they have a reason to do it and they
have all the time in the world
because you know they exist for years so
the part we don't know
is when it happens we don't know if it's
already happened
probably has or it's in our future
but it's guaranteed there you can't
avoid it it would be
i can't even imagine a scenario where it
wouldn't happen the only caveat to that
is that the intelligence agencies don't
care about
most topics
so most things are not going to be
influenced by intelligence agencies
because they don't care
they don't care about picking up the
garbage they don't care about the
you know the national bird they just
care about some
specific topics and of course they're
going to be in control
of those eventually so here's some fake
news from the guardian
they've got this story that is just so
over the top
ridiculously fake news that
it should be embarrassing to be them but
i doubt it
so they've got this story about some guy
in prison who says he's the one who gave
trump the idea of drinking bleach for
coronavirus
now first of all trump never said drink
bleach for coronavirus
that that's that's fake news level one
level two is that if that were if that
fake news were true
that trump had suggested actual drinking
bleach
which never happened that there's
somebody claiming that he's the one
who gave him the bleach and and he
actually
drank some of it now nothing about this
story is true it's just so
obviously laughably
ridiculously fake but it's published in
the guardian
it's published just like real news
and once you see how often
large publications will print things
that are just
obviously made up i mean you don't you
don't have to be a genius to know this
one's made up
you don't have to have any inside
information you can just look at it
say oh that's that's crazy
just keep that in mind as we continue to
put the mosaic together
um did you see that the mccloskeys
the couple who had the ar-15 and a
pistol and were defending their
their home uh against um i think it was
black lives matter protesters
and i guess they they must have pled
guilty to some lesser charge
which involved them giving up their
weapons so they had to
they had to turn in their their ar-15
and i don't know probably the pistol
and uh but
here's the weird part they had to turn
in their weapons
but there was no prohibition about them
driving to
a gun store and buying new weapons
so they did that was their penalty
their penalty is we're taking your
weapons away
but nothing to stop them from
immediately buying replacement weapons
which they not only did but they took
selfies
hey here's us buying our new replacement
weapons which we can totally do legally
and the whole time i was looking at this
i thought to myself
that guy's a good lawyer
if can you imagine a better
legal outcome than well we're going to
take your weapons away but you can buy
replacement weapons right away
and you're going to get some publicity
and you'll be more popular than ever
he is a good good lawyer it's you know
it's not a coincidence he's rich and
lives in a big house
all right here's a simulation alert
apparently there's a democrat
senator named white house
this is his actual last name white house
now of course you think he's going to
run for president because his last name
is
white house but it also has white right
in the name
and interestingly the new york post is
reporting
that he's been a member for decades
in a allegedly all-white private beach
club
and you know he's a progressive so this
is a you know
extra hypocritical story
but i'm going to say put a pin in that
one
i think this smells a little bit too
much like
fake news meaning is there really
a beach club in 2021 who
actually has literally says we're not
going to let in anybody who
isn't white is that literally happening
or
is this simply where they live unless
you're rich
and unless you know about it you're not
going to be in this club
so maybe it just is you know a natural
outcome of
who they are and what they're doing
which one is it
i'm a little skeptical about this story
could be true all right so i'm not going
to rule out the
possibility that's exactly right the new
york post has a pretty good
uh pretty good record lately of getting
stuff right that other people are
getting wrong
right wouldn't you agree so the new york
post
has been kind of solid on on some of
their scoops
but this story doesn't quite
quite fit so keep an open mind about
this but the simulation alert is
that his name is white house and he was
allegedly in an
all-white club i don't believe it
all right rasmussen had a uh
poll that asked how important is freedom
of religion
to a healthy society 82 said very or
somewhat important
remember i told you that you can always
get a solid
25 or so who will answer any poll
in a way that's just crazy and and i
think that 25
you know could be 20 could be could be a
little more than 25
but every poll seems to have this little
solid
20 25 people who either didn't
understand the question
or were intentionally trying to ruin the
poll
or are amazingly stupid or some
combination of those things it's just
every poll and so it's almost as if if
you get a result that says 82 percent
of people say anything you should think
of it as a hundred percent
because the other people they're just i
don't know what's wrong
who in the world in the united states
would say that uh
freedom of religion is not important
really really you can get you can get
almost one out of five americans
likely voters who will literally say the
freedom of religion
isn't terribly important
i'm not sure that that's true so much as
it is a
snapshot of civilization which is you
can get 20
of people to be wrong about anything if
you said
oxygen is it important for human
survival
20 of respondents would say i don't know
i think
oxygen is not real i think oxygen is a
probably just a rumor so
eighty percent is a hundred percent in
my view
so british doctor peter dasak
um who got a bunch of people together to
sign a letter that got
printed in the lancet medical journal
saying that the wuhan lab leak theory
was not credible turns out he got fired
he got fired from the u.n commission
investigated covert
because not only was he maybe not
helpful
he was the opposite of helpful and
apparently
he had long ties with the lab and
basically did something that on the
surface
looks like the least ethical thing i've
ever seen in my life
right now again there might be
something to the story that we don't
know that would soften that opinion
but i don't know what it would be it
literally looks like the least
ethical thing ever
i mean you'd have to go back to you know
industry suppressing information that
smoking
tobacco causes lung cancer i mean you'd
have to go
you'd have to dig pretty deep to find
something less ethical
than what happened here apparently
so keep that in mind when you're
thinking to yourself well those experts
those experts told me what to think he
was an expert
and he got 100 other experts to sign
something that wasn't even
close to true not even close
so here's a little story that proves the
gel man amnesia
let's see what do you call it a theory
or a concept
and the idea is that if you happen to be
the topic of a news report
you know that it's fake but the people
reading it don't know because they don't
know what you know
or if you're specifically the gill man
amnesia
is if you're an expert in a field you
can tell the stories about that field or
but you can't tell that the other
stories are untrue because you're not an
expert
so here's an example of that most of you
might be familiar with
christopher ruffo who has been
doing amazing work uncovering
some of the race related education in
businesses and schools
naturally he became a target
for the left because he was doing such a
good job of
exposing the let's say clumsy
and or dangerous ways that race was
being
taught both in corporations and in
schools
so the washington post does this hit
piece on him
and uh he
basically just strangled them i've never
seen anybody beat
the media as convincingly so here's what
here's what christopher ruffo uh tweeted
about it he said winning
the washington post hit piece against me
has collapsed
they have admitted to fabricating a
timeline
just listen to this these are the things
they've admitted
they have admitted to fabricating a
timeline
retracted or added six full paragraphs
to give the right context reversed a key
claim in other words just said that was
fake news
and failed to produce evidence of a
falsified
quotation
now does that sound bad
now imagine this this is normal
if you've never had a hit piece written
about you
and i'm lucky enough to have had a hip
piece right written about me
several of them actually this is
actually pretty normal
that even a respected publication
i guess that's you know subjective can
just make up stuff
just totally made up and and destroy
somebody's credibility
just by printing it now even though
christopher ruffo basically just took
the piss out of them i've never seen
anybody
just destroy an article like this so
convincingly
but here's the bad news how many people
who read the article
you know know about the corrections
not many so the hip piece still works
even though it's been uncovered as
unscrupulous still works
so that's the world we live in so can
you trust the news when it talks about
an individual who is let's say obviously
a target for either the left or the
right
so this isn't just about left to right
this is just the way stuff works
no anytime you see a hit piece about an
individual just say to yourself
probably it's just the hippies and the
the details
might be missing a little context and
the quotes might be made up
now in the in i want to say this in the
comments
how many of you think that that major
publications
routinely make up quotes actually put
quotes on them
and publish them as as if the subject of
the article said them
how how often do you think that happens
that the quote
is literally made up
all the time until it happens to you
you just wouldn't even believe it but
i've i've been the subject of
lots of articles and i see
almost i don't know half of the time
there's a quote in there that i didn't
say
it's just something they they think they
remember or sounds like something i
would have said
so they just come up with a quote put it
in quotes and just say i said it
it happens all the time so when you see
anything
in quotes don't believe it it might be
true
and it might not be true but don't
believe it just because it's in quotes
and it's in a major publication it
doesn't mean anything
and never has it's not like a new
phenomenon
the things in quotes are literally
frequently made up in all kinds of
publications
you know big and small and respectable
and that
jack passovic tweeted this provocatively
today
i think it was today the new york times
in october 1903
predicted that a flying machine would
take scientists
millions of years to invent that was in
1903.
same year that the wright brothers had
their first flight
so the new york times was off by
millions of years the smartest people
uh on the who were all over this were
wrong by
millions of years and
as jack points out neither of the wright
brothers attended college which is an
interesting side point
yeah i added to this uh point my own
little experience
all right so here's a true story in 1995
i was in a meeting with top hollywood
executives and
and the top agents not the top but among
the top
uh executives of agents like really you
know a plus people
and i propose that if we did a dilbert
movie which is what
we were there to talk about that it
should be sort of uh what i was
describing as a computer generated
like 3d movie today you would call it
cgi
but back then you know the the language
wasn't quite
as clear and so i said we shouldn't do
this
typical flat animation you know like the
simpsons we should do like a 3d
computer generated thing the experts in
the movie
the experts in the movie industry
sitting around the table
unanimously told me can't be done
we don't have the technology to do that
sort of a thing and
make money at it this was 1995.
a few months later toy story had
theaters
smartest people in hollywood didn't know
toy story was already well under
production
made over 300 million dollars so we live
in a world in which your experts
sometimes are off by millions of years
there's a interesting video i tweeted
you can see it in my
twitter feed with uh and it's done by
mays m-a-z-e at his twitter handle
is i i think is a m-a-z-e-m-o-o-r-e
and what's interesting about this is
that it shows
you know the clips of harris talking
about the border
in a very in a very open border way and
then
cuts to clips if we're talking more
recently don't come don't come and if
you come we'll send you back
so basically it's showing a complete
flip-flop
of opinions about immigration now
we'll often see this with vice
presidents in particular
so you shouldn't make too much of it
because it's sort of a vice president
thing
to have to reverse some specific topics
when you're when you're working for the
the top guy or top person let's say
let's be less sex
less sexist um and
here's what i wanted to point out the
talon stack
on maze so
if you just look at the the profile
this is someone who is a digital artist
a video editor and a researcher
and says you have seen my work which is
probably true
so that's a pretty strong stack isn't it
so i'm only pointing this out not so
much because the hair is part
because that's sort of typical for a
vice president to do a flip-flop
but look how strong this is to be a
digital artist
at the same time you're you do video
editing and you're a researcher
so you can find stuff that is the
content you're doing your video editing
every time i see a good uh talent stack
i like to point it out
barry weiss on substick has a guest
essay by abigail
schweer and the title of it really
really caught my attention the books are
already burning
now you think to yourself well you know
they're not really burning books in 2021
right because that would be the the
worst thing you could imagine
when you were a kid didn't you always
hear that if if you're in a world where
people are burning books
that's the worst place to be but we're
there
it's just that the books are youtube
clips
so the burning of books is a 2021
phenomenon
the the worst thing that you could
imagine for the health of society
which is to you know delete people
because they just
they disagree with the mainstream that's
going to turn you into china
that's going to turn you into the
country they can't innovate
it's it's the people who are wrong and
have the freedom to be wrong in public
who drive everything because sometimes
the people who are completely wrong
well sometimes they turn out to be the
wright brothers right
so you need this freedom to be wrong and
really really
wrong and wrong a lot in order for
society to move forward
it's i would say the one of the great
systems that makes america so at least
economically dominant
is that you could be wrong as hell in
america you can start a company that
nobody buys your product you can fail
like crazy
you can fill in a seven different things
before you succeed
i mean you can say things in public that
are just stupid you know when you find
out what's real
you can fail like crazy in america
and have the wrong opinions and still
be okay so this is really dangerous
the and the one of the topics here was
the uh
the dark horse podcast with uh brett
weinstein
so that's getting a lot of pressure now
i'm not saying that
i'm endorsing everything that's in that
or any other
content i'm saying that if they if you
don't allow them to be right
or wrong i'm not the one who can judge
that
but if you don't let them be right and
let them be wrong
you've just destroyed the engine of
america being
wrong is the engine of america
because that's what allows us to iterate
until we hit something that works
right you can't you can't use something
that works
by shooting at it once one person you
know
hit that target ooh let's let's hit that
target it's about trial and error
and we're this country is one trial and
error
mofo it's what we do best is fail
in a good way um
coincidence or not judge this
is this a coincidence or not today
nick gillespie of reason um you all know
i hope you know
of reason the publication
he tweeted a tweet that i said about the
airports being busy
now is that interesting no not
especially
it's just nick gillespie of reason
tweeted something about an airport
that i tweeted the weird part
is that uh yesterday i was literally in
an airport
talking about nick gillespie
because i was in athens airport and liz
wolfe who's also with reason
recognized me sitting there and
introduced herself and so i said oh yeah
blah blah blah
you know i know nick gillespie and
what are the odds that on one day i'd be
talking about
nick gillespie within an airport and the
very next day
nick gillespie would retweet just one of
my tweets
and i don't think he's retweeted
anything from me in a while
it's about an airport what are the odds
coincidence
hold that thought hold the thought
and now we're going to give you
the micro lesson i'll bet you glad you
stayed around
for this this micro lesson is not about
what is true it's not about what is true
all right now let me introduce it
here's a micro lesson on understanding
what level of awareness you're operating
at
now first of all this is a way of
looking at the world don't think of it
as true
or false it's simply a frame or a filter
you can put on the world
that either works and helps you
understand things
or it doesn't so judge it only by
whether it's useful
not whether it's true and let me tell
you
what these levels are and this is based
on my own observation
so everything here is just from me as
the source when you are born
and you're a child i'm gonna call you
innocent you believe what your parents
tell you you believe in santa claus you
believe in whatever religion they tell
you is the right one
you basically believe authority but as
you get a little bit older
you become what i call a truther
somebody who thinks that the facts and
the truth
are what really matter and you
understand that people could lie to you
your parents can lie to you about santa
and the
easter bunny and the you know the tooth
fairy
but other people other adults could lie
to you too so you got to be careful so
you're a little higher level of
awareness now
because you know people can lie and you
know
that the facts and the truth are the
most important thing
unfortunately once you believe that the
truth is the most
important thing you become a victim
because the truth is not something that
you have access to
it's something that's provided to you
and you tend to accept it
that is to say that there are people in
power who control
what the truth is so the moment you say
what matters to me most
what will guide me in my decisions my my
affiliations
will be the truth you become a victim
because leaders will feed you a truth
that you'll believe
that will be putting you in a victim
category
the leader will say hey you're black you
need to
be with all the other black people and
ask for certain things hey
you're a member of the lgbtq community
you need to
be a victim so that i as a leader can
get you
some some better stuff you know better
stuff in terms of
a better life so
the moment facts are your most important
criteria
you will almost always be dragged into
the victim
level of awareness and leaders will tell
you that
they have the truth you will accept it
because you
tend to affiliate with a side and accept
their truth
this is a bad place to be
next if you can climb out of that maybe
through experience and
just thinking about things right and
maybe you have a good mentor
you can raise your level to be a skeptic
a skeptic is someone who rejects the
assigned opinions
doesn't mean you have the right answers
doesn't mean you're the smart one
it just means that you don't
automatically take the the
the approved answer you become skeptical
so this is a higher level of awareness
but has a limited utility it can keep
you out of trouble
by by keeping you skeptical to things
that might hurt you
but there's there's still a ways to go
the next level is what i call the
strategist level
where you say to yourself i don't know
what's true
but i do know what works i know that if
i have more talent
and build a proper talent stack that i
will be more effective i know that if i
use a system
rather than a goal i'm going to get a
better result i know if i work hard
i'll get a better result than if i don't
i know that if i network with lots of
people
i'll get a better result than if i don't
so the strategist
is not working on so much what is true
but rather what they observe
works
and then at the top level i call this
the author level
now can the author actually change
let me change my spelling here a
terrible speller
simulation that's close enough
um i'm not saying an author or a person
operating at that level of awareness
can literally change reality because
we're not smart enough to know that
we don't even know what reality is much
less that someone is changing it
but they will have the experience of it
and when you observe them it will seem
as if they can
who would be in this level well i would
put trump in that level
trump isn't caring so much about the
facts
right you know he's he's loose with the
the fact checking he's certainly above a
skeptic
and he's uh certainly understands
strategy
so he's passed through these levels to
the point where he literally just makes
stuff happen
out of nothing how about uh mike
cernovich
he's an author he does things that you
almost can't understand would be
possible
he's simply authoring the reality or or
it looks that that way
right so keep in mind i'm saying it's
the appearance of changing reality
that's
the part we can observe we don't know
what's really happening under the hood
how about uh um naval ravikant
in my opinion he's operating at the
author level
meaning that if you look at his life and
what he's able to do
it just doesn't seem normal it's almost
as if
he can manipulate reality itself so
people can be in more than one group but
i would uh i would submit to you that
one way to use this
is if you are in a disagreement with
somebody
you might not actually be disagreeing
and i have this
problem quite a bit on twitter there are
a number of people
on the truther level who will come at me
on twitter and they'll say
for example transgender people
are whatever whatever they were born at
uh this is a man
and this is a woman and that's just a
fact
that's the truther level if somebody at
the truth or level
the fact level that's like that's the
only thing that matters is the facts
gets into a debate with somebody who's
operating at a strategy level
at least much less the higher level
these two people
will look like they're having a debate
but they're not
they're not even they're not even in the
same uh
i don't know realm of reality or
awareness
so for those of you who say to me but
scott
it's just a fact this is a man it's just
the fact
that this is a woman well if facts are
what matter most to you
okay but we're not having the same
conversation
i'm at a strategy level and i'm saying
well what works
given given this set of uncertainties
and disagreements
what do you do about it what what's a
system
that makes all that work and that's a
different conversation
than is somebody definitely a man or
definitely a woman
might be fun to talk about doesn't have
much use in the real world
versus strategy and the higher level is
if you want something to happen make it
happen
and that is your micro lesson
so notice that the stories that i talked
about
were all about subjective reality
they were all about fake news and
they're all about what you believe
once you release on the fact that you
can't really know what's true
then you have the ability to rise up the
levels of awareness
and make yourself more effective if
you're completely
limited by what the facts are
then your ability to author the
simulation
will be just not something you could do
but the people who understand that
there's something about this reality
that doesn't quite make sense in terms
of our factual or even scientific
understanding
once you see how often the same people
can seem to author the simulation
because it's the same people
right somebody who can do it does it
more than once
right elon musk is authoring
the simulation elon musk is not trapped
in any of these lower levels right i
don't even think he's at the strategy
level
although clearly he understands strategy
i think he's i think he's operating
unambiguously in my opinion it's hard to
know from the outside
but it looks to me like he's changing
reality
consistently and when somebody can do
that
you have to say to yourself how do i do
that
and that is your live stream for today
and i'm gonna go do something else and i
am so happy to be back
in america even though vacation was
terrific
and i hope you enjoyed this live stream
and if you want to see the individual
awareness
level micro lesson that'll be posted on
the locals platform subscription
platform
a little bit later today and i will talk
to you
tomorrow
