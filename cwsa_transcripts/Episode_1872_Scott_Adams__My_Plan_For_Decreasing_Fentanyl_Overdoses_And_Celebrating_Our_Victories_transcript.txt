good morning everybody
and welcome
to
an amazing amazing experience
today you're going to find out how to
end the fentanyl crisis
i'm going to tell you some amazing
things that will blow your mind
but first
how would you like to get in the right
mood
would it take mushrooms
no
no
all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker gel
system a canteen jugger flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the parallel pleasure of the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and it's famous all over america and
it's happening now famous all over the
world really go
oh
wow
wow
i didn't know life could be this good
okay it's wearing off now i guess it
wasn't permanent
well i hope you all caught this
important story
this this is maybe the most important
important thing
did you hear about maroon 5
singer adam levine
and his little uh
his little personal problem
didn't hear about that
now i hate to feel
i hate to laugh at somebody's personal
problems because i know you've had a
good laugh at mine have you not
so i guess it's fair fair is fair now
it's not because it's a bad thing
happening
it's only the specifics of it that are
funny right so i don't wish bad things
on anybody because it's actually a bad
story there's a story about three people
who are unhappy right now
and it doesn't look like they're going
to get any happier but here's what
happened
uh so maroon 5 is married to this super
beautiful
i think she was a model or an actress
whatever she was
and they're having their third or fourth
child
fourth
right so he's very married to
a famously beautiful woman
victoria's secrets model yeah a famously
beautiful woman
and uh having their fourth kid
and he sent a text uh to his mistress
who is an instagram model
and uh asked the mistress if it would be
okay with her
if he named
his fourth baby after his lover
her first name is sumner
that didn't go well
turns out that uh she shared that
message with one of her friends
um
gonna give you some advice right now
there's a little advice
there's no such thing
as sharing a secret
about the maroon 5
singer
with your friend
yeah because your friend's not going to
mention that to anybody
right
that's what friends are for
no there's no such thing as
somebody who's not going to tell this
story
i mean seriously you tell your best
friend and confidence look
my boyfriend this famous singer guy
wants to name his fourth baby after me
is mistress
how do you not tell that story
there's no way you don't tell that story
so i guess one of his friends offered to
sell sell the story to a tabloid
that would be your first indication to
reassess your friend group
if you ever have a friend who wants to
sell a screenshot of your private
message
to ruin your life
to a tabloid
that's the definition not a friend
not a friend at all
well if you ever thought marriage was a
good idea among beautiful people this
should change your mind this is another
reminder that the
uh the people who cheat are the ones who
can
and then they do
um
my favorite biden story
so you all saw some clips of him being
on 60 minutes
and looking
completely lost
i i think biden only has he's got one
eye that's half open and one eye that's
super squinty
so his and his his mouth is
now he's up
this is mountain
yeah
and so that that part looks a little
weird
but here's the part that uh is the most
i don't know
interesting i guess i was gonna say fun
but this doesn't sound fun
have i told you i think i have a few
times that when i took hypnosis
classes
my hypnosis instructor taught me this
trick
that
i didn't think was real
like i in my mind i was just debunking
it's like that's not real that's just
something you see you think it's real
but that's not real
and what he said was that people will
tell you
exactly what their secret thoughts are
if you just listen to them
just listen to the words they choose
and their choice of words not the
sentences
the sentences might be misleading but
sometimes within the sentences will be
phrases or choices of words that
completely give away their inner
thoughts
sort of like a
you know freudian slip
now the first time i heard it i thought
that's not true
like people don't give away their inner
private thoughts that easily
and then you start looking for it
it's just it's so often true
like i i don't know if there's ever been
any science study of it but it sure
looks true
here's one i spotted with biden that
really jumped out
when asked
by 60 minutes if he were planning to run
again
he said it was his intention i'm going
to paraphrase a little bit
he said it was his intention to run
but that uh you know there are certain
things that get triggered if you say for
sure you're gonna run
so he was explaining how the process
works right
you might have an intention to run
but the final decision is what triggers
a whole bunch of activity so until he
wants to trigger the activity
he's not going to make it official
but the words he chose to explain that
very ordinary thing
right there's there was no news in that
that's just an ordinary way people do
stuff
but the word he he chose was that it was
his intention to run
but it remains to be seen
it remains to be seen
do you know what a hypnotist would say
about that
he just announced his own death
because his remains
will be seen
now keep in mind this is in the context
of the queen's funeral
in which her remains
is it open casket
is a queen an open casket
i don't know how that works
but
whether she's not an open casket that
makes sense so but still her remains are
there to be seen
right they're in a box but remains to be
seen
now
yeah so you can't see her that makes
sense i think we would have seen a
picture if you could see her
um
so
now you're gonna have the same
experience that i did
which is you say scott that is quite a
stretch
stretch
you're saying that just because he used
a
common phrase
remains to be seen as a very common
phrase
right just because he used a common
phrase and gave an ordinary answer to an
ordinary question
that he's announced his death
yes that's what i'm saying
and we'll see
now this is not one of those hundred
percent things right
you get that right you can't predict it
100
but to me this is a glaring signal that
he is contemplating his own demise
which suggests
the timer is already ticking which
suggests he may have some illness that
we don't know about yet
that's what i think
i believe he has an undisclosed illness
so i'm going to make that prediction
and the prediction will be entirely
based on this one
phrase remains to be seen
anybody want to take the other side of
the bet
now it's not based on looking at him he
does he does look you know not like
super healthy but that's more age
and of course you know the odds are sort
of in my favor because he's at a certain
age where everybody gets something
not too not too many people want to bet
against it
now even i think i would bet against
myself if i'm being honest
if you said all right now put money on
it
i would bet against myself
but for fun because this is a good test
of the theory right sort of an edge case
if this one's true you're really going
to believe the next one aren't you
[Laughter]
so that's all this is it's an experiment
right so this is an experiment
to see if my hypnotist instructor
was correct that people say exactly what
they're thinking if you just listen
we'll see
again i would bet against it i think the
smart money says
you know he'll survive
at least until the re-election
but it sure looks like he says he's not
uh rasmussen does some polling on how
people are thinking about ukraine
42 percent of u.s likely voters think
that
the russian invasion of ukraine has made
america's security
situation worse
18
think it made it better
what do you think
does the ukraine situation the entire
situation
there does it make america less safe or
more safe secure
what do you think
well
here's one of those questions where
what you're what you're actually
answering matters because you will
interpret the question differently
i would say that the variability is way
up wouldn't you
the variability of what could possibly
happen in the next year or two is way up
if you say the variability in other
words are just more variables in play
they're bigger variables they're just
more swirling around
doesn't that always make you less safe
by definition
but one of the possibilities is since we
can't predict what's going to happen
one of the possibilities is it makes us
more safe
by permanently degrading russia
or
or
the safest situation would be a strong
russia
because you don't want a weak country
with nuclear weapons
do yeah
that feels like a really bad idea that's
what happened to ukraine they were a
weak country with nuclear weapons
didn't work out
so
i don't know i'm not sure if anybody can
tell if we got safer or less safe
because it depends what happens next and
nobody knows
but i would like to say this
because i've been accused lately of
never saying anything good about
democrats
if things go the way they look like
they're going to go now
i think the democrats and you'd have to
give biden credit because he's in charge
allegedly
it looks like their strategy in ukraine
is working
and i'm not sure that anybody thought
that would be the case
i mean even i said that ukraine is going
to put up a better fight than anybody
imagined so i think that was a good
prediction
but
to me it looks like the biden
administration showed that nato
is not to be with
what do you think
and maybe that helps us in the future
that nato just they're not going to get
pushed
i don't know maybe it helps
i think you there's plenty of room to
disagree with this yeah
but um
do the shoe on the other foot test the
old uh
this is the dershowitz dershowitz test
if
if trump had done everything that biden
has done
gave lots of weapons to ukraine fully
supported him against russia
and said you know you're not going to
take ukraine we're going to make make
sure it doesn't happen
and then we got to the place we are now
where it looks like russia
won't take over ukraine
do you think i would be saying it look
like a failure
seriously
don't you think i would be praising
trump
for executing a strategy that was
exactly what he said he was due
now i might have
now i might have criticized him for
getting us into the situation which
might be different if he did i don't
know if he did
maybe there was nothing he did maybe he
did i don't know don't know the details
but
yeah but let me ask you just one
question
if trump had backed ukraine and ukraine
was clearly seeming to do really well
wouldn't i say that trump did a good job
wouldn't i
i would
so why wouldn't i say that about biden
it's really tough for you isn't it to
hear anything good about your
your presumed
political nemesis
but it's a good but it's a good uh
exercise
it's a good exercise i'm going to
compliment another democrat in a little
bit
i want to see if you can hang with it
but i think you can all right this is
the smartest group
i believe this is true by the way i
think that
my live streams are the smartest
observers of the news
because you learn to observe it through
a different filter than other people are
observing it and i think that just gives
you an extra
extra sense basically
all right um
so although the ukraine situation you
know
maybe part of our spiraling
economic problems
but it looks like the strategy is
working at least the military strategy
all right
speaking of a democrat who gets smart
um
there's a guy running for governor in
pennsylvania named shapiro he's a
democrat
and he attended private schools
and his children attended private
schools have you seen all of the
tweets by corey d'angelis
who outs every person who says i don't
want school choice but then you find out
they had school choice
they actually went to an alternative
school
it's a lot of politicians are in that
boat democrats democrats who went to
private schools
and say no people shouldn't have that
choice
or they shouldn't have more choice you
know not that choice but they shouldn't
have more choice
and so and of course
that's uh the polls show that that's
pretty much a death sentence
to be against school choice at the
moment
so shapiro he's a regular democrat he
runs for office and he puts parents
above teachers unions
like explicitly
puts parents above teachers unions
and he's in favor of school choice
now he's a democrat
how does that not work
how does that not win in the election
seriously
you know
the thing that makes me nuts
is we see all these allegedly highly
capable people running for office
and they do have good
credentials you know a lot of them are
from the best schools and lots of
experience and stuff and then they get
into these high offices
and they can't do the simplest stuff
to please the public and it's none of
it's hard it's not hard
how hard was it for a democrat to say
you know what
well because of fundraising right but
you know what i think parents are maybe
higher priority than the teachers she
needs
then the teachers unions will you know
fun try to fundraise against them right
no they won't
the teachers unions are not going to
fundraise for a republican against a
democrat
it's a it's a free shot
it was a free pass now if he had enough
money
so he didn't need any extra money from
any teacher union stuff
then he's fine
he's fine
now i say the same thing about
republicans it would be so easy for a
republican to talk about let's say
immigration
in a way that didn't sound racist
super easy but they can't do it
now i don't think they're the
republicans
are doing their immigration border
policy because they're racists i don't
believe that
i think they're doing it for you know
all the reasons they say but when they
talk about it they do sound racist quite
often and i think they're not
but i look at their language i'm
thinking seriously you couldn't do
better than that
when you know you're going to get
accused of racism and you can't do
better than that
there's nothing you can say that would
take that stink off you
of course you could it wouldn't be hard
watch me do it
watch me do it right now
here's my view on immigration
we should separate the question of
our ability to control immigration
from the question of who we let in
we keep conflating them like our policy
is to is to be haphazard that's not a
policy we should have total control over
who gets in and then we should use our
empathy and our awesomeness and our
economic strength
and our economic wisdom to decide who
gets in and under what conditions and
then we dial up the border to let in
that many people under those conditions
but you let the decision of who comes in
be made by economists
bipartisan ideally you want some
bipartisan economists to say you know we
need more people
you better lessen
dial it up
no things are bad if you let more people
in it'll be bad for the united states
even though it's good for the immigrants
but how bad well
just a little bit bad a little bit bad
but we are helping all these people and
you know they'll become good citizens
okay we'll still let them in
we know it's a little bit bad
we know it's a little bit bad but we're
also a big generous country
so a little bit bad we'll live with that
right
but what if the economist say is real
bad
well then we'll turn it down
now
that was a totally republican
point of view was it not was that not
100 republican point of view
it was
did i not completely
free myself from accusations of racism
completely
there's nothing there you can chew on
nothing
because i said a bipartisan commission
will decide who gets it done
they'll just look at economics instead
of other stuff
right i even allowed that we would
take some pain
to let in our neighbors from the south
who need some help
a little bit of pain
right
there's no republican who wouldn't take
a little bit of pain to help somebody
out
that's who you are
why not have a candidate who represents
who you are yeah you take a little bit
of pain to help somebody out absolutely
you you would help your neighbor mow the
lawn if neighbor got sick
couldn't mow the lawn you'd mud along
you you'd you would shovel your
neighbor's snow out of their driveway if
you knew they couldn't do it
right that's what you do
so a little bit of pain sure
but too much pain is just giving away
stuff you worked for
you didn't sign up for that
so
so easy
to to tell a republican story that
everybody would buy so easy and what
does trump say
trump says over and over again they're
not sending their best
i assume he's trying to make it sound
racist at this point
i mean i can't believe that he doesn't
know what that sounds like at this point
maybe the first time he said that he was
just being provocative
but at this point he still says it
still says it
what's up with that
all right
uh you can use your own judgment for
what's up with that
um i was looking at a list of the
audiences for the biggest network shows
and i didn't realize that uh
the five
just destroys other shows i didn't
realize on fox news that that show has
just become like a powerhouse
and
uh so now greg guffeld has you know that
show plus gotfeldt that's absolutely
ruling the evenings
did anything did any of you have on your
prediction card
greg gutfeld runs most of the world
did you see that coming
i i don't think you understand how
important it is
when did when certain personalities
become prominent at fox news because fox
news
sort of shapes
you know the biggest the biggest single
group in the public
uh shapes their opinions
so yeah i mean he's not the only person
on the five obviously so
dana perino now has
she's on the five and also her her other
show
is also in the top five i think like
she's killing it yeah dana perrino is
just killing it and jesse said oh yeah
jessie right jessie's got two
top rated shows as well so the the three
of them from the five
pretty much
are just the most influential people
around right now now of course tucker
and
um hannity will always be you know
singularly special
but it's interesting to watch to see how
that's going to shape up especially as
the next
presidential election comes at us
um
so i saw an article in vice
that uh this twitter whistleblower
alleges that a chinese spy works at
twitter and and maybe i think there was
at least a saudi arabian
employee spy that was caught at a
different time
but
when he brought that information to
senior management allegedly
and by the way this doesn't sound true
to me
so here's a story
of you know story you weren't there
it's not anonymous but you weren't there
and allegedly when the whistleblower
brought that information that he
believed there was a chinese agent on
the payroll
that the unidentified
executive said well you know if there's
one on the payroll
what does it hurt to have another one on
the payroll so let's grow our staff
i feel like maybe there's some context
missing there right
i don't think i don't think an executive
said that
i don't think so
that's not something that comes out of
anybody's mouth
something like it might have been said
i i could certainly believe there's
something unsatisfying or
you know well you know maybe
sub-optimal came out of this voice i
don't think you said exactly that
but we'll see
um
now who was it who told you
probably
five years ago
that i thought that some of the things
you were seeing in terms of the
algorithm look like they might have been
influenced by foreign
countries
who was the first person who told you
that twitter was definitely
controlled by foreign entities by now
if not the cia
right
and do you remember the reasoning for
why it had to be true
there's a reasoning for why it had to be
true without any evidence
with no clues no evidence no
whistleblowers why did it have to be
true
it's the same reason
it's the same reason that insider
trading exists
it has to exist
it's a it's a huge payoff
there's no real penalty if you get
caught
right
because china doesn't care if they if
they catch and fire one of their
agents
huge payoff
not much downside if you get caught
lots of time
and lots of people involved who would
have an interest
if you have all of those things it
happens every time
lots of time
lots of people who are interested
it's really important if you could if
you could pull it off and there's not
much downside
not much downside at all
under those conditions
the predictable thing happens every time
it's not sometimes
it's every time
right
now i've said that about our election
systems
which doesn't mean that they are corrupt
and it doesn't mean that anything was
wrong with the last election
what it does mean
is that there's a hundred percent chance
it will happen if it hasn't already
in other words
corrupting our election systems whether
you're a foreign entity or
an interested party in the united states
lots of people involved
there's lots of time to get things done
the penalty for getting caught
would seem to some people low enough
right there's some people who say i'm
not going to do that but there are
plenty of people who do crimes and fraud
especially white-collar crimes you can
find plenty of people who are willing to
do that
so you have plenty of people
lots of time
huge payoff if you can pull it off
because you can control the election
outcome
that's all you need
it'll happen 100 of the time
now does that mean that somebody has a
way they can cheat from the outside i
don't know
i have no idea
but if you put somebody on the inside
and they're part of the process they're
writing the software they're designing
the hardware
there's some stuff they can do
so yeah
so now we we've now found spies at the
following places
twitter
feinstein's car
and swalwell's bed
what do those three things have in
common
democrats
democrats
have any republicans been penetrated
either republican run companies
or republican politicians
no
yeah feinstein's driver was a chinese
spy
that's the perfect job for a chinese spy
isn't it driver because i hear
everything
all right
um
peter zan
has been talking for a long time about
the coming decoupling from china
now there are people have different
agreement different opinions on this
right
so the
the opposite opinion
is that we'll never get all of our
manufacturing out of china that's just a
pipe dream
but peter xan points out that we've
already
you know that the trade war
is sort of
this low grade by escalating situation
that's a little bit below our our notice
at the moment but something really big
happened apparently we are preventing
advanced chip
manufacturing components and and
equipment from going to china
so china according to peter xan doesn't
have the ability to manufacture its own
advanced chips and doesn't look like
they would have it anytime soon
so
so we'll you know of course china will
fight back with their rare earth
minerals and everything else at the same
time we're developing batteries that
don't need them
so i think you know they'll be
but they want to sell them because they
make profit so
it's going to be this weird fight dance
it's like a dance fight but i guess
there's some you know disagreements
about airframe so it's now aircraft
advance anything with a chip is not
going to be traded
and
do you remember about to
uh well and actually peter's hand says
that in one to three years
if you don't get your company's business
out of china you're gonna regret it
basically he thinks that you won't be
able to do business in china
in one to three years that there will be
a complete collapse
of any uh at least american company
that's in china they just won't be able
to operate there anymore
and
um
how many of you remember
that about
probably the end of 2018
when my stepson died of a fentanyl
overdose
how many of you remember i vowed to
bring down china and cause the united
states to decouple their economy
do you remember that
what did you think about it at the time
in 2018 when i said i was going to crash
china and decouple our economy from them
what did you say
crazy
crazy right
totally crazy
now coincidentally
and maybe because of the pandemic you
know maybe some other coincidences but
coincidentally it's happening
so pretty lucky huh pretty lucky
prediction
is it amazing how lucky i get
you remember when i predicted that trump
would be president in 2016.
got pretty lucky on that one
remember when
i advocated for closing travel to china
when the pandemic broke out
you know what did you think when i said
close travel to china well that's not
going to happen
but then by coincidence and by luck it
did just by luck
got pretty pretty lucky there
so i got lucky again it seems that
that this decoupling is happening with
complete coincidence and had nothing to
do with me whatsoever
let's talk about fentanyl
um
have i mentioned that i'm going to
punish china for fentanyl
and i'm surprised it hasn't happened
already
but
the decoupling should be you know plenty
good for punishing china they'll be left
with their aging population and
they got troubles
but
here's what i would suggest i read the
the republican plan so there is a
republican
maybe strategy or plan for dealing with
it
here's the weak republican plan totally
totally toothless
increase the penalties for dealers which
might include life or life imprisonment
or death
but these are american dealers
right so the republicans want to punish
americans
for china sending in precursors that
turn into fentanyl and the cartels
punish americans
now these americans would be breaking
the law
and causing people to die but just keep
in mind that the republican plan is to
punish americans
okay
um so that's suboptimal
and let's see what else would they do
they would
they would make it possible to sue
countries that are responsible for the
fentanyl coming in
so i guess you'd be able to sue china
and mexico
so that's going to work out for you
right
to sue china because i'm sure they'll
pay up when you win your lawsuit
how about mexico
when you win that lawsuit
how long before the check arrives in the
mail
i can't imagine this be having any use
at all
you're not going to sue china and get
some money are you
i don't see how that's going to work
um so that's toothless
so we're going to punish americans
because china is attacking us
and then we're gonna
do that thing that makes no difference
at all
um and then there was something about
limiting immigration
from countries that
um
are
involved in this so i guess we're gonna
try to limit immigration from mexico
are you laughing yet
that's the republican plan
we'll tell
try to limit limit immigration from
countries involved mexico
now is there is there a big problem with
chinese immigration
how many chinese citizens immigrate to
the united states
i don't think it's a big problem
so that's completely toothless
i mean it would be like a small
annoyance
all right
so now i'm going to tell the republicans
how to do their job are you ready for
this
this is how you do your job if you don't
want to be pathetic and weak like their
current plan
you take fentanyl out of the drug
category it needs to be
two but for this purposes you say
fentanyl is a weapon of mass destruction
that comes from china and is weaponized
through the cartels china actually sends
the precursors that cart the cartels
turn into fentanyl and then they ship
here in pills
here's what you do
you say that if an american
sells fentanyl
to another american
that the american who sold it
is not a drug dealer
they're a traitor
and you
you
prosecute them for a war crime
it's a war crime it's treason
what is it treason or traitor what's the
is it
whatever the word is but basically it's
collaboration with the enemy
and you take it completely out of the
drug realm
completely out
you treat the addicts as addicts
you treat the dealers as traitors
and you use only
traitor law to go after them
and you say this is a war and you even
get congress let's say you as
republicans you ask congress to declare
a war
just declared war
now
i don't think that would start a hot war
meaning i don't think that would cause
china's to launch their nukes just
because we did some paperwork
but we could say this is a weapon of
mass destruction
describe where it comes from and where
it goes through and say if you're the an
american who is part of this process
you're a traitor
because you're part of the war effort
for china
now here's why this is brilliant
number one you can't ignore this
right if this started happening the news
would have to talk about it all the time
because it's just too hard to ignore
right so that's the first thing
if you want something to be handled you
need to get focus on it
so it would be a provocative way to get
focus it would reframe it
have i told you that reframes can be
very powerful
so you reframe it that way
and then you treat it that way
now
would a drug dealer
if they had a choice of selling heroin
or being a traitor to the united states
now you say to yourself scott
if somebody's already a major fentanyl
dealer they don't give
they don't give a about the united
states
they're already not
patriots
i think you're wrong
i think you're wrong
i think you would find out that drug
dealers are patriots
american drug dealers now not all of
them
not all of them might be 40
might be 40
but i think you could take 40 of the
dealers right out on the market on day
one
by saying oh
i don't want to sell out my country i
just wanted to make some money and i
don't respect this law
then what happens if you find out
there's a trader selling drugs on your
corner
no no not a drug dealer a traitor
traitor to the country
you're looking at him
wait a minute that's not a drug dealer
that's a traitor
he's not even in my country well you
drop the dive
you call the police and have the trainer
picked up but if he's just a drug dealer
do you mind your own business maybe
maybe you mind your own business
because if you think well he's just
coming off these idiots who are on drugs
and you don't have much sympathy for
idiots on drugs do you because you're
like well i'm not on drugs
they should be not on drugs too i'm not
endorsing that point of view i'm saying
that a lot of you have it
right so you don't care if a drug dealer
kills some drug addict most of
you literally don't care
be honest
you don't care many of you don't i'm not
all of you but many of you don't care
you really don't care if a drug dealer
kills a drug user you know let's be
honest about it
you don't right
but would you care
if a chinese
agent or a trader was on your block
there's a there's a guy trying to
destroy your country he's right there
you're looking at your window you look
you're seeing right you're looking right
at the guy
somebody's going to shoot him
somebody's just going to kill
him
just assassinate him right in the corner
so some some republican will just walk
up with a gun and take his head off
not on day one but you'd have to you'd
have to really build this thing to the
point where people sought that way for
real
right
so if the 15 year old dies because they
thought they got his annex and it was
fentanyl and they died from the overdose
yeah that's that's not the person we
want to hate on
um you don't want to hate on that person
all right so that's my idea
so i believe if you reframe it as
as a weapon of mass destruction
that it doesn't have to be reframed for
its medical use
because we do the same thing with botox
right
botox can be rat poison if you're
killing rats but it can be you know
cosmetic surgery and has other medical
uses if you're using it that way
so i think we can deal with the fact
that it can have a medical use but also
to be
largely treason
on the street
now do you think you can drone the
cartels more likely
if you've defined it as a war
of course you can of course you can if
you define it as an addiction problem in
the united states you can't join the
cartels
but if you define it as a active war
you can do anything you want
because it's a war
all right
[Applause]
see a comment most gun crimes are
committed by democrats
is that true
it feels like it's true but do we have
an actual statistic on that the most gun
crimes are committed by democrats
because you know what
i think republicans should also do this
but more as a joke
they should suggest that democrats
only give up their guns
so if you register as democrat
you should be required to give up your
guns
do you know why
because it would make the world safer
the democrats say that any gun you take
out of the system makes the system safer
if you took all the republican guns out
or i'm sorry if you took only the
democrat guns out of the system
wouldn't they be safer
that's their exact argument
their exact argument
is that all guns are dangerous in the
public
and republicans have i'm sorry democrats
have tons of guns
lots of them
so why don't we say prove your point by
getting rid of guns from democrats
if the if the murder rate goes down
because democrats gave up their guns
come back to us with your argument
i don't know if it would
but don't you think that
because here's the reframe the reframe
is that republicans largely want guns
for
self-defense and hunting and protecting
the union
right the republic
and so mostly they use them for that
there are plenty of republican criminals
as well
but if the democrats are serious at all
about what they want
they should disarm first
because that's their entire plan
their plan is that every gun out of the
system makes you better off they don't
say take the guns away from the bad
people do they
they do not they say take all guns away
every gun is a danger
so if that's true republicans should
tongue-in-cheek but not really
not really they should embrace and
amplify
have you heard me say that before it's a
great persuasion technique embrace and
amplify rather than arguing their point
you say well why don't we embrace your
point
we also agree that democrats should get
rid of their guns
and let's see if that makes you feel
safer
and we're all we're all in uh
republicans on the other hand will keep
their guns because we're largely using
them for self-defense and hunting
stuff you don't care about
would that change anything in the real
world probably not
but the argument would change
if the republicans stuck to that and
just every time a gun control argument
came up said look
we're we're halfway we should meet in
the middle
you'd like all guns to go away
we'd like
people to have guns
let's meet in the middle
democrats give away all their guns and
see what happens
the trouble is how do you argue that
how do you argue it the only argument
democrats could have is well we need our
guns for self-defense
and then what do the republicans say
what do they say
no we're not going to give her away our
guns because you have guns we need guns
for self-defense
[Laughter]
now i don't know how many times i could
make the same point
being a republican with a good argument
is so easy and nobody's done it
nobody's done it
not trump
trump's done the best
but i'd give him a b-minus
i mean his immigration persuasion is
terrible
it's terrible it's terrible for the
public it's good for the base
it's terrible as a president
so it's baffling isn't it it's baffling
how bad they are at communicating
because i'm not wrong these are better
communication strategies
all right
there is a hilarious video that i highly
recommend just a few minutes of your
time you have to watch the clip that's
going around i retweeted it this morning
so you can see it on my twitter feed of
don lemon talking to some british woman
i think the main topic was you know the
queen
but the question of reparations came up
and don lemon asked her if the brits
should be thinking about paying
reparations
it didn't go well for dawn
[Laughter]
you have to see this
it's like really good
and so the woman without losing a beat
she describes how so remember i told you
to embrace
embrace the other argument
so instead of saying reparations are
stupid get out of here with that doma
idea that would have been a losing
argument
here's what she said
reparations
i'm gonna paraphrase right so she didn't
say it exactly this way reparations
absolutely we should go look at the
cause of them
the cause was the african kings who
rounded up their own people and put them
in cages and put them on the beach to
wait for people to pick them up so i
could sell them
and they were the beginning and so we
should look at those uh we should look
at the
descendants
of those african kings and asked them
for reparations
then she pointed out that uh 2 000
british soldiers 2 000 i think
navy people died trying to stop
trying to stop slavery and she pointed
out and people are debating this by the
way but she said
that great britain was you know the
leader in ending slavery
so she said should the people
the british people who died
trying to end slavery
should they get reparations too because
they died fighting on that side
so she's like yeah
reparations
for the sailors who tried to stop it
let's give a big hand for the cut the
first country in the entire world of
civilization who tried to stop slavery
great britain all right
and for that
and what about those african kings
we should talk to them about reparations
now this is a version of what i've been
saying
a version of what i've been saying is
you can't have a reparations
conversation in public do you know why
because it'll always go this way
if you put me in that conversation what
am i going to add
i'm going to say well
uh if you look at let's say the the
model that we have let's say the
japanese internment camps
there you had living people still alive
who were getting reparations you had a
clear
enemy
the american government no other
governments
there was no african nations involved it
was just our government
they made a decision it was purely
racist
and
and they knew how much they took
so the people who were rounded up i
don't know if you know this but if you
owned property
and they put you in the japanese
internment camps
some some white person would go down to
the
clerk's office and just bribe somebody
to change the name on the property and
then the white person owns it
so the japanese were rounded up and put
in the internment camps
they lost everything
everything
but we could you know you could get a
pretty good idea what that everything
was i mean as an estimate you knew
exactly who took it
and though some of those people were
still alive lots of them actually
so that is your perfect reparations
example
right
but
because that that has a that has the
comparison built in so you could say
what would happen if we didn't do
anything with the japanese american
public
and then compared to what happened when
we did and you could say oh you had a
house you lost a house
that's pretty objective
right
but then you look at the african slaves
and you get some economists involved the
first thing they're going to do is the
first thing that happened in the
japanese internment case what are we
comparing it to
well you're comparing it to staying in
africa
and having a king who doesn't mind
selling you and putting you in a cage
so you would go back to a situation
where that was okay
right so that was your alternative
now i'm not saying that slavery was
better than that i don't know sounds
like they were both pretty terrible
i'm saying that that's what you'd have
to compare it to so you'd say are
american
american
who americans who came from you know
legacy of slavery do they have more or
less
money
than the people who stayed in africa and
were not sold as slaves
that's that's the comparison
and what you find is that they're doing
better
so what do you do with that
see the trouble is
slavery was a sort of a
except for the holocaust i suppose an in
an incomparable
evil right
the evil is the thing that's
under our skin
so to speak
you know it's just the evil of it you
feel like you need to address the evil
but you can't do it economically because
the economics weirdly were not the evil
part
the economics were coincidentally
weirdly somewhat positive you could make
the argument
it was just a horrible human thing to do
so there's no way you could have the
argument in public because it would
devolve into that
where you you would get a big dose of
how do you calculate stuff how do you
compare things you know what's the real
value of things
oh there we go
so there's a comment on youtube
dallas hosey says
uh it's working i'm an attorney and
today i had a large institutional client
ask if the shareholders of their company
could sue the entities pushing esg
as it drives down their share price
you're welcome
[Laughter]
now did i tell you that when dilbert
talks about something
as a well-known thing
that that becomes a legal standard
i've told you that before right so the
dilbert comic strip has been used as a
legal standard
to define when you should have known
something if it's in the comic
you should have known it i mean if if i
could put it in a comic strip without
describing it
that's the standard
i can publish it without having to
describe it that means you should have
known
right
now
dilbert is mocking it as a you know a
terrible thing
so that's what i've been doing all week
now that i'm mocking it as a terrible
thing
that frees all the people who were going
to say can we say this was a terrible
thing
can i say this out loud
now you can
because it's in a dilbert comic
right
i basically took the cancellation risk
for you
you don't need to get canceled because
it got in the comment because the
newspaper published it
i took the i took the risk
and i did in fact get cancelled in a
number of papers i don't know if it's
temporary or permanent yet but a number
of papers stopped running dilbert
for that series
because i think that they have esg
influences as well i don't know but i
think that's probably what it was
however there were enough that ran it
and ran online and probably got
probably got copied and said to
everybody
so at this point i've established a
legal
standard
which is that anybody
involved in esg
should have known what they were getting
into
you can no longer claim you didn't know
it was a problem
do you see the power of that
that's really powerful
because anybody before could have said
well esg sounded like a good idea it had
all these noble goals and by the way the
goals of esg are great
i love the goals
it's just that when you takes this
outside control and you layer it onto
the free market you don't get a good
result
so it's about implementation you just
can't implement something like that
so
i believe
that i've accomplished my mission
i'm still working because that was
important
if i had been completely cancelled
then nobody would raise their head right
if i talked then against esg and got
completely cancelled
there's no stockholders gonna
there's no employee who's going to
complain that's for sure
so by flying close to the sun
and surviving
i i increased the envelope of
conversations
so now people they know they can go at
least as far as i went
they could go that far
because i did it and didn't get
cancelled
and they can say hey it's not just me
this is everywhere this is not my
my opinion look it's in the newspaper
the newspapers are publishing
this all right
so
um i think
i think that on maybe
three occasions
the thing that i've
be influenced and it's hard to know
is that there are some things that are
just too wild to think about
and if i can make you think about it
then it becomes part of the conversation
i hate to use that phrase but it's
something you can talk about because it
has been talking about you know somebody
did it
so i think i did that with uh
closing travel with china that was
unthinkable
but when i started talking about it
you're like that's unthinkable well i'm
thinking about it now
and then it happened
decoupling from china was unthinkable
but people like me talked about it and
then you thought about it
and after you thought about it for a
while it was no longer unthinkable
you might not want to do it
but it was definitely part of the
conversation now
right
with uh
fentanyl being treated as a
weapon of mass destruction and treating
our dealers as traders and not dealers
that's a wild idea isn't it
if nobody had ever talked about it could
you imagine a republican presenting it
it'd be kind of risky
might get laughed at right
but because i've presented it and i got
a positive response
now it's safe
isn't it if there if there's anybody in
congress watching this right now
you just learned
that you could say that in public and
you're going to get a good good
feedback
right
probably thomas massey might see this
tom cotton sees some of the clips i know
there's a number of other people i won't
mention
but there are a number of people in
congress who do watch this and staffers
etc
so i feel like that's
maybe the thing i can do
that really makes a difference i can
take your mind where you didn't know
would be safe
i can just make it safe for you
so that's what i'll continue doing
all right
what else is going on
oh
so uh yesterday's dilbert joke
um
mentioned non-binaries
and you probably said to yourself
oh
no
don't go there if you if you mention
non-binaries
in your dilbert comic you're going to
get cancelled
so i mentioned non-binaries in my dilma
comic
and not only did i not get canceled but
i got retweeted by the association of
lgbtq plus corporate directors whose
mission is it to get more diversity in
the boardrooms
and uh they loved it
they loved it
now let me give a shout out to the lgbtq
plus community and most specifically the
gay community
has anybody done a better job of
persuasion
like in the history of the whole
freaking world
the gays
are awesome at this so so good this was
exactly the right response to me
the wrong response was
ah you tried to use this as a dupe why
are you bringing us into this
stop making it about lgbtq with your
republican audience are you mocking us
nope
hey this is fun do some more
how awesome is that how awesome is that
right
very awesome
sue
and the joke was that
esg measures your environmental impact
as well as your diversity
and the joke was that the ceo knew that
they couldn't do much about their co2
emissions they were going to go up so he
was going to con compensate
and and he was asked to how much the
ambitions would go up
his answer would go up about one
non-binary board member
you know so they're just using it as a
scale for for co2 emissions
yeah how much co2 emissions do you i it
was about wow
two non-binaries and
lesbian
but if we build another factory it's
going to be two binaries a lesbian and
uh possibly a gay man
so that's how much emissions we have
anyway i just thought it was funny to
equate them as like currency two things
you could trade off
all right
i don't know but
i feel like
this was the best live stream of all
time
i feel like it was
am i crazy
no it was it was it was the best one of
all time
and i think we should drink to that
youtube are you with me
wow i ended right at 8 o'clock too
amazing
all right
we're going to do ourselves a little
simultaneous sip
this one for such a good job
now i tell you this all the time
but i want to remind you
i only get to do what i do
to the extent that you like any of my
persuasion or effect on anything i only
get to be persuasive
because you show up
right
like this whole thing is just one big
machine
and i get more most of the attention
i'm sort of like
i'm sort of like the key that starts the
car
but i'm not the car
right i'm just the ignition
you're the car
so what you do
is 100
necessary for anything i do
that's useful
and to that
i salute you the simultaneous sip is for
you
go
was that good
oh my goodness that was good
so good
well yesterday i gave you a reframe
about forgetting your history and your
past and the feedback i got from that
both during and afterwards
was really phenomenal
and
you know i'm writing a book right now on
reframes it will include that one and so
i took i took yesterday's
presentation and essentially wrote it up
much the way i presented it because i
thought the order of that worked out
really well
so
so you'll see that in the book
the other reframes i think are just as
powerful
maybe more
and here's here's the proposition let's
see if this would sell a book so this is
a marketing question for you right so
it's not a question about necessarily
what you will do so it's more of a
marketing question
if i if i had a book with let's say 85
reframes
and they apply to
your happiness and your specific you
know modern
life and i told you you know
there might only be
one of these reframes out of 85
that will have an impact on you
but if it has an impact it will just
change your life
would you buy a book that 85 reframes
if the proposition was it's only going
to take one of these to change your life
and i guarantee one of them will
which i do by the way
this would be an impossible book to read
without changing your life
i don't think you could do it
the thing with the reframes is you don't
have to do any work
a reframe you just have to listen to
it's the easiest self-improvement you
could ever have most self-improvement is
 like keep a diary
you know use your free will and your
your uh you know
your
your stick-to-itiveness and stuff like
that
but with reframes you just have to hear
it
you basically just have to be
walking by
and you can get all the benefits you
just have to hear it once and you're
done
do you include a reframe that makes your
iq 185
weirdly
i didn't but i did that reframe
so you think you're joking but i'm going
to do that right now i'm going to
reframe
all of your iqs to 185 you ready
if you start with your basic iq the one
you're born with that's probably not 185
but then you layer on education
if you add some education
to your natural intelligence don't you
aren't you smarter in a practical sense
not your iq
but in terms of dealing with the world
you're smarter
okay
now
add emotional intelligence to that
where you can forego
some benefits
i bet most of you have that
i mean you you show up here almost every
day at the same time
pretty organized right most of you have
that so doesn't that make you
operate as though you're smarter
because you'll get better results
so now you got your natural iq but
you've boosted it by what you learned
then you've boosted it again because you
have natural emotional intelligence so
so those operate as sort of a total so
now let's say you started at 120
let's say if you had the right kind of
education
and you had emotional intelligence you'd
be operating like somebody at 140.
now
at a talent stack
and systems instead of goals
and when you add the talent stack and
you start building a set of talents that
work well with each other that's the key
is that they they're additive to each
other
can you operate like somebody with an iq
of 185
yes
yes you can your functional intelligence
will be through the roof
if you add the right kind of skills
together
right
what is
kanye's
like natural iq
i don't know it looks pretty smart
right i would say he's probably very
smart
but then you put on top of that
all of the other skills that he's put in
his stack
and then you get kanye
he operates like his iq is 185.
if functionally right
i would argue that
whatever my natural iq is
that i have assembled a set of skills
persuasion
you know live streaming et cetera that
makes me functionally smarter than my iq
would you agree
would you agree with that claim
that i operate
functionally better than my iq
just because of the weird skills i've
compiled now i've said for example that
if you want to know the future
the two skills that will do that best
are economics
follow the money
and persuasion part of psychology
psychology in general but persuasion
specifically if you know persuasion
and you know economics and business
you're in really good shape to know
what's coming next
and i know those two things
those are my two strongest categories
so it's not an accident if i if i get
better results
than other people
so i believe that i get better results
than people who have my same
organic iq
because i assembled things which made me
operate higher than my iq
and i think that you all do the same so
i i think that you could assemble
the same set of skills
largely because i'm helping teaching
teach you you know you have my books to
look at
if you read these two books
and it failed almost everything is still
one big your personal life would start
looking like you're a genius and if you
read win bigly
you would learn persuasion
and your effect of this in general would
look crazy i mean people wouldn't
understand why you were getting the
promotions you were you know dating
above your station and everything else
so they would you would functionally
look like you were smarter
and that's my point so you didn't think
i could do that did you
you didn't think i could reframe your iq
up to 185
and then i just did
challenge accepted all right that's all
for today youtube
i'll talk to you tomorrow
