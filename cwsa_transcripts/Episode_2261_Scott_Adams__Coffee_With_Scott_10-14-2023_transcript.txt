[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization cwsa
as we call it if you would like this
experience to go to levels that you
can't even imagine all you need is yeah
you know a cuper mug or a glass tanker
chal ory a c to flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine hit the
day the thing that didn't make that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go oh pretty
good so if you don't mind I thought I
would solve most of the world's problems
today um I don't know if I can get to
all of
them uh I got quite a quite an agenda
but I will try to uh I will try to get
to uh you know most of the world
problems and then solve
them um yesterday did anybody notice
uh was it the day of
Rage everybody got through the day of
Rage pretty
well uh or some call it the day of jihad
the day of
jihad or as one wag called it low energy
Jihad it feel it felt a little bit low
energy didn't
it you know what I'm starting to
think I'm starting to think that the
Palestinians are not as popular as I
once
thought apparently they're only popular
in American
colleges they are not popular in their
own part of the world because Egypt
won't let them across the border and
their neighbors don't want any more of
them
so
maybe maybe it's something they're doing
that makes them
unpopular um but we will make it a
distinction between the Palestinians and
Hamas because you know what the uh the
real war is sure there's a horrendous
War happening in Gaza physically but the
real war oh the real one for all of us
uh online
soldiers is to try to avoid saying
something there's some idiot
will misinterpret am I right my entire
day I wake up and say how can I avoid
being misinterpreted by a idiot
like Sean
Hannity who's a idiot I hate to
tell you I kind of like I kind of like
his skill set he has a lot of skills but
we'll talk about him in vake
yeah no the the whole goal today is for
somebody not to act like you we not
sensitive enough to the suffering of
this group or you you didn't understand
that Hamas and Palestinians are
different yeah everybody understands it
but you're going to look for any little
any little slip up aren't you aren't you
not you but you know what I
mean all right well uh I'm going to
start with the biggest story of the day
uh AOC did a video in which allegedly uh
she has heard farting during the middle
of her talk now if I were being an
honest broker of information I would
tell you that that was almost certainly
fake
news I'm not here for that
today
um so I'm going to I'm going to treat it
like is real the the funniest thing you
say to yourself as I did Scott there's
no way this can be funny it's just Eric
swall well times you know you know
updated uh it's not real anyway so
what's funny about it it's just you know
childlike and then somebody put
together what what they claimed to be a
a
heat some kind of a heat
map or infrared a thermal yeah like a a
thermal map her talking then you see the
the cloud coming out from
the to which I say sure maybe you think
this is a fake news story but I say to
you follow the
science follow the science because that
thermal map of AOC farting was no more
and no
less useful than climate
models very similar same same same kind
of zip codee yeah you should either
believe them both or believe neither of
them that's my advice well let's move on
to the next most important news of the
day on a TV show called The View which
amazingly is still on TV and amazingly
there's still thing called
TV uh the host sunny hoston and I think
it's
funny because she's a host and her last
name is
Hosten
come on her name is sunny she has the
worst personality in the world but her
first name is sunny hey let's do some
Sunny hosting except I'm going to call
you all racist not so Sunny now but
here's what Sunny host and said quote I
think we all know Hamas has been
designated a terror organization just
like many other Terror organizations
have this designation like the proud
boys here in the United States
wait what proud boys are not a terror
organization nobody nobody's ever daed
the day the proud boys as a terror
organization
now could I be even more
graphic may I have permission to be
obscenely
graphic let me explain to you Sunny
hoston who the proud boys
are the proud Boys number one are not
people who have done everything the way
I wish people who do things can we can
we stipulate I do not agree with the
actions of all the proud
boys let me say that up
front number two if Hamas ever attacked
the United States the proud boys would
be the ones who stopped them from raping
you the proud boys would be the ones who
are standing in front of you and between
you and the terrorists the proud boys
are the ones who are going to get ripped
apart physically to try to give you 10
minutes more to
escape the proud boys are going to be
saving your life if trouble ever
comes now I'd like to add to this an
observation which I don't know is valid
or just sexist so you can tell me is
this valid like just an observation or
am I being being super
sexist I'm just going to say it
directly nobody cares what women think
of
War yes or no nobody
cares now I've been looking at all the
commentary about you know the situation
in Gaza and it kind of follows after
Ukraine of course Ukraine is still
active
and you you see lots of opinions I mean
both men and women weigh in all the time
but the nature of the opinions is
different when women are talking about
war it often falls into the category of
you know the
victims um when they talk about uh
Israel they talk about the victims when
they talk about Gaza they talk about the
civilians
and yeah but most mostly they're talking
about the cost of War and that's good
there's good good that somebody's
talking about the cost of War but we
also knew what the cost of war
was when men talk about
war they talk about whether you should
do it or
not and they also talk about
how like a typical male conversation
would be how are you going to clean out
all those underground bunkers can you
get that done with the thermo Thermo
Barra Munitions or uh by now do we have
a whole bunch of uh tunnel robots and
we'll just send the robots down there or
does it just make more sense to bulldoze
them just leave them down there so
that's how men talk about war and the
question I
have is um did war just clarify gender
roles is that what happened when when
you don't have the luxury of just
talking
 everybody just knows what to do
right if if the goes down the men
step forward and the women step back and
that's the way it's always been and
probably will always be now no
disrespect meant to the many women who
serve in Armed Forces because you know
we respect their services completely
it's a different situation anything I
say that's sort of generic doesn't apply
to all of you right anything I say about
men doesn't apply to all men anything I
say about women doesn't apply to all
women sort of a general General theme
sort of situation though
so um I just find it very interesting
that uh We've automatically gone to
gender roles and nobody complains when
life and death are on the
line has a way of make you serious
doesn't
it all right let's talk about to
Shameless
Liars so Jonathan tole was tweeting that
Leon Panetta
uh I guess yesterday told uh Brett Bear
over at Fox Leon said that he has not
seen evidence establishing that he and
others were wrong about calling the
hunter laptop Russian
disinformation that's right it's October
2023 and one of the signers of the
famous uh Hunter laptop disinformation
letter you know all the past and uh
current uh intelligence experts Leon
Panetta being one of
them still to this day says that he
can't rule out uh that it wasn't Russian
disinformation now what does that tell
you about the
world I don't know if it's telling you
much about Leon benetta but it's
definitely telling you something about
the world you know what it's telling
you that he knows the news is fake and
he knows that no Democrat will ever see
anything he ever said to Fox's Brett
Bear so he can tell he can tell the the
right side of the world
anything and the left will never know
what happened and the right will just
yell what they always do you stinking
lying Democrat but nothing changes
there's no cost to it he can he can so
rather than embarrassing himself in
front of the enemy you know the the
viewers of Fox News he just just says
anything he wants because it doesn't
make any difference it doesn't make any
difference what he
says what a world Shameless
Liars are you all familiar with the
all-in
podcasts all in David
Sachs uh and the others whose names are
harder to pronounce or harder to
remember and it's a sever basically
Super Rich Venture Capital uh Tech guys
who have a podcast that makes a Big
Splash in the podcast world so they
they've really carve down a little space
in the political um sphere so when they
say things they often get quoted Etc
they they have a little bit larger
impact than most because I'm not sure
but I think everyone on the podcast is
probably literally a genius you know if
they took an IQ test you wouldn't want
to compete against them sort of thing so
they do have a
big uh
impact and uh the big surprise from the
recent one that just
dropped is that they seem to agree
that Trump did a good
job and that he was totally
underrated and at the time they couldn't
see it but in the fullness of time it is
now obvious that although at least one
of them uh opposed him and was a
Democrat probably still is um that he
did good work especially with Jared
Kushner who was very smart and
capable now does that sound like a
prediction that somebody made like
me I told you the longer that Trump is
out of office the better he will look
the reason for that is simple two
reasons number one you would have
something to contrast his work with
which is
Biden a you know semi-controlled border
versus an uncontrolled border no new
Wars versus two new Wars all right and I
could go on but you have
contrast uh no inflation versus lots of
inflation although the inflation has a
lot to do with the pandemic and and both
sides are losers when it comes to that
but you got you've got your contrast but
the other
effect is that the brainwash wears
off brainwashing wears
off and if you're not fed a continuous
stream of new brainwashing it just sort
of Fades and is replaced with your own
observation over time so that was the
basis of my uh prediction is that people
were in a a really heavy persuasion
bubble and that once he was out of
office the bubble would weaken and you
would just be able to see through to the
other side side and that's exactly
what's
happening all
right well it's another tragic day of
not having a speaker of the house and
once again it comes down to me to list
all the problems that is cussed I'm just
going to start at the top and go down
alphabetical order having no speaker of
the house for what uh was days now and
these are the list of problems that uh
We've encountered starting with a
um all right next story let's talk about
that uh ground offensive over in
Gaza so I guess Israel is dropping
pamphlets telling the people in the
northern part of Gaza to evacuate I
think they're saying evacuate to the
South I guess I don't know my situation
enough to know what's happening on the
ground there but wouldn't they be
evacuating into Rubble
did Israel already flatten the South and
and now they're asking the remaining
part to evacuate to the rubble or or am
I oversimplifying maybe there's
something still I mean where would you
go if you don't leave
Gaza where do you go that you don't just
starve to
death so I don't know exactly what's
going on
there but uh let's talk about whether
it's a ground a Siege you know they
called it a Siege Israel did and I told
you that meant that they don't plan to
go in in a standard old-fashioned way
where you go door Todo while the other
people are shooting at you I never
thought they would do that now there's a
few reasons why they don't need to one
is that uh Hamas is
underground if AAS is mostly underground
they can just flatten what's above
ground and don't have to worry about
somebody shooting at them from a
building because the building won't be
there and my my thoughts were they were
just going to
flatten uh wide enough perimeter so that
there's nothing on the left or the right
of them you know they're they basically
just a big old flat nothing left
Battlefield
so that's my first thought is they're
certainly going to have you know troops
on the ground there's no doubt about
that but I don't think it's going to
happen until there's not much left to
the
ground would you call that a Siege or a
Invasion I mean what kind of invasion is
it if there's nothing left by the time
they're on the ground now the other
factor that I don't know how to wait is
how much robotics they have apparently
they have these uh giant um bulldozers
from hell that they can control
remotely so the bu those are so big you
can shoot at them and it'll take an RPG
and bounces off and it can actually
dig up
landmines and they explode in front of
the blade and the blade is just so damn
thick it just keeps going so certainly
they'll be sending their remote
controlled bulldozers in but why why
would Israel send in anybody to get a
shot at until they just completely
cleared it out with technology and
bulldozers and bombs so I've got a
feeling that that because Israel is well
let me State this as a
assumption so this is not a fact it's an
assumption my assumption is the only way
to handle Hamas is to depopulate
it so I think they're depopulating it in
every way that they can I mean as much
as they can because theas will try to
keep them there but I think they have to
depopulate it so that they have any hope
of later repopulating it
in other words you're going to have to
just reboot just literally get every
every shoe off the
ground and out of the
area keep them safe if you can I mean
ideally you want to keep them alive the
non-combatants
and figure out how to move them back and
when
so I think that's what it's going to
look like um I'm not entirely sure
that Israel wants to clear out all the
tunnels do you think that they want to
uh go down and kill those people in the
tunnels which would include
hostages or do you think they just want
to leave them all
there because it might be better if
nobody ever found the hostages meaning
there's no way to get them back back
alive
anyway now if you tried to cover if you
tried to cover the entrances and exits
to the tunnels your problem is what's
your problem
that we'll check your military strategy
if you cover the exits and the
entrance uh and even tried to C cover
the air holes what would be hamas's
response well now the hostages
unfortunately I think are data under all
scenarios I hate to say but if they're
underground I don't I can't I can't see
the scenario they come back well
actually no I'm wrong what if they what
if they pumped a sleeping gas down there
if they could find the
air if they could find the air intake
they could pump uh just sleeping gas of
some site right actually that might be a
way to get those so there might actually
be a way to go but here's the question I
have could they could they rebuild
Gaza over the bodies of 20,000 Hamas
Fighters were literally underground you
know and just there forever what would
that do to the hearts and minds of the
Gins if they knew that people that maybe
they supported at least mentally maybe
they were
non-combatants but they know these are
their you know cousins and brothers and
fathers and they're just
buried below where you build up a new
house are they going to go for
that I don't know so there's a real
olical question about whether you have
to clear the tunnel the bodies out or
whe just you know drop a mother bombs
and just collapse them and leave them
there because I feel as
though I feel as though there would be
something in the psychological you know
moral superiority way that would be lost
by leaving them there because you'd also
be leaving the Israeli um bodies there
so I feel like they have to get them one
way or the other feel like they have to
get the bodies under
there they probably will
try now the big uh question that I think
is the biggest variable here is will the
uh the war in Gaza be so brutal on the
uh civilians that it backfires against
Israel and I think the answer to that is
100% dependent on the number of
casualties would you agree if somehow
they went into Gaza and you know 25
civilians
died we would consider that a tragedy
because they didn't need to die but we
would also say because I hate to say
it you know you can't mourn forever we
would also get over it pretty quickly
because we say well you know over a
thousand
Israelis 25 you know innocent people you
know they did what they had to do but
what if
it's
5,000 what if 5,000 civilians die in
Gaza well then I think people will say
all right well we didn't want them to
die but Hamas is responsible and we'll
probably get over it but what if it's
20,000
civilians what's the point where you
don't get over it anymore what's the
point where it
reverses the psychology of the entire
situation until the world says you
know you could have done anything but
that that was too far remember you got
about two
million uh residents they say 2.3
million um I imagine some number have
already left I don't know where they
went but you you assume in that
situation some number just ran for it
but proba say there's at least two
million and half of them are
kids how many how many of
those could die in the act of War before
Israel turns out to be worse than if
they had done
nothing I don't know what that number is
but I did a little poll and asked people
about 24% thought that the the ultimate
number could be over 100,000 that's not
the number that changes to psychology
that's the number that people just
predicted when was the last
time that many people died I mean way
more people have died in
Ukraine but probably not as I don't know
if they've died at percentage more but
so that's the that's the question so the
question to roll around in your mind is
what's that number that once you cross
it you're worse off than if you hadn't
had the war at all
yeah when do you reach you know Dresden
proportions exactly if you don't know
Dresden firebomb during World War II
essentially erased the entire place was
just
erased all right so uh we'll keep an eye
on that one of the factors is how much
we learn because I don't know that we
will ever get accurate numbers of the
civilian dead do you
because the people in charge of those
accurate numbers will be the
attackers I believe only the
attackers will have any official numbers
that are believable because the uh Gaza
residents themselves have no
infrastructure if you have no
infrastructure you have no way to check
you know against records or or anything
if you have no infrastructure there's no
way you'll know how many died but
Israel almost assuredly
because all of their institutions will
will remain will do something like a
count or an estimate of the
Dead would you believe the attacker
estimate of the civilian deaths on the
other side in any
War right now this is not a statement
against Israel per se I just don't
think it's credible to believe the
attacker about how many civilians died
on the other side that's not that's not
something anybody should ever believe
ever which is not to say that Israel
would fake that
number I'm not saying they would I'm
saying why would anybody believe a
number coming from the attacker right
the winners the winners get the right
history yeah we can't even get a number
for Hawaii that we believe exactly so
it's not no insult to Israel to say that
you just don't believe the
attacker that's you know and and you
could argue with me whether they are the
attacker because they're really
defending themselves I get that
point all
right
um I saw kakoa the great doing some
posting on X about the attitudes and
sympathies of Americans toward the
Israel Palestinian
situation and here's something I know
maybe this will surprise you that
Democrats sympathy with
Palestinians stands at 49% overshadowing
their support for Israel at
38% did you know that Democrats by a
strong
majority favor the Palestinians over the
Israelis I didn't know
that I I think I only was thinking in
terms of you know the entire American
public so the entire americ American
public favors Israel Over the
Palestinians um but can can I uh let me
clean up my speech there I believe the
average American has sympathy for both
sides see that's the part where I could
get taken out of context right see how
hard this is it's so hard to not put
yourself in a trap where somebody can
take you out a contract contrast and a
context and say these are are your exact
words here's you quoted saying the exact
thing and a
context all right so Republicans sympath
sympathy with Israel or the is stands at
78% overshadowing their support for
Palestine at 11% so Republicans
overwhelmingly support the
Jews um Democrats by a pretty strong
majority
uh do not support the Jews in
Israel Independence um
are pro-israel 49 to 32% for the
Palestinians now are you as confused as
I am about what this is going to do to
American
politics let's see if I have any chance
at all of not getting cancelled I'm
going to be really careful on this one
you ready
wh watch me you like I'm crossing the
stream like jumping from rock to rock
and I won't know if the rock I jump on
next like is
stable I see if I can get to the other
side have you noticed that many racists
on uh the xplatform will point out the
number of uh news media entities that
are owned by people that the racist
anti-semitic people call
uh Jewish owners and CEOs you've
probably seen that Meme or claim a
billion times yeah they they the the
Jews own all of our
communication now what will those people
say what will the anti-semites in
America
say and and what will
happen as uh you know these events are
playing through because I'm trying to
understand how the platform forms which
the American anti-semites say are all
run by the
Jews how are they not going to take the
side of the
Palestinians because that's what
Democrats take and in America s and 10
Jews are
Democrats do do you see how confusing
this is getting it's like everybody's
point of view doesn't make sense
suddenly like the anti-semites are
saying oh the Jews control the media so
therefore the media the Democrat media
is going to be all all pro-israel but in
fact the people who consume this very
media that the anti-semites say is
dominated by
Jews those people were being
somehow immune to the media their own
media and coming to opinions that are
opposite of the alleged owners of the
you know primary owners of the
media nobody's opinion is making sense
right am I making my case I I feel like
I need a little more here
but let let me put it in more Stark uh
terms how in the
world could Democrats win another major
election did Democrats not just
lose the entire media structure
so and then how how in the world do
colleges continue to teach something
that the so-called according to the
anti-semites in the United States uh the
the messaging is all controlled by one
group and yet the colleges are breeding
people with the opposite point of
view it kind it kind of calls into
question all of your biases doesn't it
your your entire worldview is now like
wait a minute okay wait the Jews are
mostly
Democrats but the
Democrats are opposed to the at least
the Israeli
Jews nothing makes sense does
it yeah you get what I'm talking about
right I'm not sure if I'm coming through
yet because I'm looking at your comments
and they're all over the board
here yeah so under these conditions do
you not
expect that the med media both the
traditional right leaning media which is
already there and the left leaning media
will start to
agree about uh let's say a narrative
about Israel and that it will be
different from what the Democrat based
beliefs so does this
separate the mainstream media from the
Democrat base did those two just get
separated because you know that the
biggest risk in America has been that
the media and the Democrat base were
always on the same
side and now in perhaps one of the
biggest question of our times they just
and it made it clear I think it would be
very clear to the you know the uh the
media that they're in
trouble and that their own base has
somehow been radicalized against their
interests
so what
does that do I mean here what I'd expect
would be a massive shift of uh American
Jewish opinion toward Republican
leadership although I I would um I will
say that Biden has been you know
completely supportive of Israel so he's
got that going for
him um at least recently I mean Biden
was a little bit more standoffish about
whole region until he had until he had
to pay
attention yeah there's a video of Biden
with his little note card of what to do
Walkin room make few comments get up and
leave and apparently he held his his
note card backwards so that the people
at the meeting and the cameras could see
his notes about how not to be a an idiot
because he had notes on the other side
as well he wasn't supposed to hold it up
and read
it he was trolling H maybe it
was so I got big questions how this is
going to change American politics but I
think it
will I think it
will you know what will be real
interesting is uh I mentioned the all-in
podcast and how they uh seem to have
some agreement there there was a
consensus that Trump looks better you
know as time goes by and I wonder if the
mainstream media will start to adopt
that
I mean that's a lot that that would be a
big big swing you say never but remember
the context here is that the mainstream
media may have broken ranks with the
Democrat
base so they may not be on the same team
anymore and what does that what does
that do I don't
know all right
um so I guess there couple of
Republicans uh Representatives Tom
Tiffany and Andy
ogles uh Wisconsin and Tennessee
respectively and they're introducing uh
legislation that would ban uh the Biden
Administration from importing
Palestinians to the United States to be
resettled in American
communities
and um so this is a brand new thing
breit Bart is writing about it and it's
uh called the guaranteeing aggressors
zero admissions act or the Gaza act okay
they TR they try too hard they so you
see the problem
right the problem is they have not made
the distinction between hamash and
Palestinian
residents now I find that
odious and I would agree with I think
Joel Pollock was pushing back on this
it's notable that he's also associated
with Breitbart so Breitbart is not one
opinion which is interesting to know
they're they're not of one opinion and
uh points out that for Israel to do what
it needs to
do in Gaza it would be quite good if the
you know non-combatants had a place to
go and could be at least temporarily uh
taken care of now I understand that uh I
understand both opinions all right those
are two opinions that make sense to me
neither of them are
illogical uh both of them are grounded
in people's best understanding what
would be the moral Way Forward so it's
it's more of a tactical strategic
question that it is a moral question in
my opinion
but um I'm going to
say we just be asking for
trouble you know we're just asking for
trouble I if there's one thing that uh
my cancellation might have taught
you it goes like
this we have to learn to
separate opinions about people's you
know
DNA or even their culture from what
brainwashing they have been subjected to
because the brainwashing has nothing to
do with your your race or anything else
it's not your religion it's just some
code in your head and if you
discriminate against people who have
code in their head you're not exactly a
racist it's about people whose idea is
they want to kill you you don't want to
be around them so uh right now I think I
saw uh it was a news thing that uh
Christopher Ruffo R is it rufo or Ruffo
I was I'm sure I say his name wrong but
uh he says that Harvard is a ju just
listen listen to this I mean this is
Christopher rufo's uh phrasing but just
listen to all the words is the
important uh Harvard has paid a
non-binary latinx academic to quote
decolonize
Harvard which he says is quote Sellar
Colonial genocidal and eurocentric
institution that must be quote
abolished and uh Christopher points out
that decolonization is the ideology of
barbarism both at home and abroad uh I
added to that I said uh you should get
the away from anybody who uses the
word colonizer in a serious way I mean I
use it in a humorous way but you should
get the away from anybody who
thinks that word belongs in America as a
description of our
reality that is a I'm going to kill you
later if I get a chance word don't make
any mistake about it that's a we're
coming for you word that is we're g to
 you upward that's what it means if
you miss that you're G to be
dead right get the away from
anybody who uses that language isolate
them don't sell them anything don't buy
anything from them don't hire them they
are coming for you they're
coming for
you and defund them if you can yeah
don't go to Harvard is my first advice
so can we understand this as a problem
with how people are thinking whether
it's ESG or Dei or CRT these are all
part of the colonizer vocabulary and all
of them have that oppressor oppressed
model and if they're labeling you the
oppressor ressor or the colonizer get
the away these are dangerous people
and you should try to put as much
distance between yourself and them as
you
can so the comment is so you promote
taking the way their freedom of speech
no no no
no what what did you hear about freedom
of
speech that wasn't
me
I'm saying if somebody announces that
they're going to kill you you should get
away in every way that you
can but we don't uh just to clarify we
don't have freedom of speech in
2023 not really we we have the old
fashiony kind of Illusion of freedom of
speech where the government itself may
not directly put you in jail but they
can use their entities
to you know freeze you out and they can
also use to make sure you never work so
effectively we don't have free speech
and I'm angry about people who
say we do because we
don't yeah anybody who thinks that Free
Speech has never said anything
interesting you can quote me on
that everybody who still believes they
have free speech in 2023 in America has
never said anything
interesting that's why they think they
have free speech try to be interesting
for about five minutes see see if you
still think you have free speech try out
see how it
goes yeah all right so I'm in favor of
uh Banning uh all immigration from
places that could have with them a mind
virus uh just as we tried to close
travel from China when the co virus was
here was that because we hated Chinese
people anybody anybody did we close
travel from China during Co because of
our hatred for Chinese people no no it
wasn't about anybody's jeans it wasn't
about anybody's
culture it was about they had a virus in
them maybe but we couldn't tell which
ones had it and which one didn't with
the Palestinians there is a mind virus
and we absolutely do not want any
children who are raised in that
environment not because of their genes
not because of their culture
overall but because in all likelihood
Hamas was their teacher do you think I
want even one child who was taught by
Hamas to grow up in the United States
nope I do not want one not even one one
is too
many is it a gigantic
tragedy that there's not an easy place
to put the people who will be displaced
yes it's a gigantic tragedy I would
never minimize that however it is worth
noting that none of their Arab uh
neighbors want anything to do with them
do you think it's because they don't
like their
genes is it because their Arab neighbors
don't like their
ethnicity is it because they don't like
Arab culture no because they are all of
those things their neighbors are just
like them the difference
is the Palestinians have a mind
virus and so the Egyptians are saying
it's not personal you're infected with
Co so we're going to quarantine
you and of course the there's immense um
suffering and cruelty that comes out of
that point of
view it's also a tough choice that you
know adults have to make so uh in my
opinion Egypt is making the adult
correct choice not treating them like
there's anything wrong with them as
people they just have a mental virus and
they don't know any way to get rid of
it I remind you that I'm going to try to
deprogram a Democrat uh on Monday on
spaces so I get a volunteer somebody
who's a mega hating Democrat and I want
to see if I can deprogram them I want to
be very clear about this it's not going
to be a
debate so I'm not going to tell him his
views are wrong I'm going to deprogram
it it's a different
process all right um when it comes to
this whole situation in Gaza uh we all
have many opinions do we not opinions
opinions they should do this they should
that um you may have
noticed that I don't I try not to talk
in the language of opinion and here's
why opinions don't
matter to what's going to happen in Gaza
the Gaza situation is only going to go
one way right I mean you could argue
about you don't know the exact details
of how Israel will eliminate Hamas but
when we're done the Hamas Fighters will
be
neutralized nothing's going to stop that
you could complain all you want you
could say they shouldn't do it but
what's the point of that you could argue
against it should never rain again but
it's going to what did your opinion have
to do with the
rain oh there should not be
gravity but there is that's not really a
conversation so when we're talking about
you know what should Israel do that's
not a real conversation
there's only going to want be one thing
that happens as soon as Hamas did the
attack the way they did the rest was
just
written so so saying I don't like
it or or saying you you shouldn't go in
and attack you know on the
ground what's the difference they're not
going to listen to me do you think they
should do do you think anybody should
listen to
me no
so let me teach you a little uh
persuasion trick may I if you're giving
opinions to
Israel Israel quite rightly should say
off because if the situation were
reversed and you were Israel and you'd
been attacked you would not be taking
the opinions of the
French am I right can we agree on that
if you're if you were in the country
that just took the blow that Israel just
took you're not listening to the
French's opinion oh we we you think we
should not counteract you you're
not part of the conversation all right
so we should be cognizant of the fact
that even though America and Israel has
a tight relationship we not really part
of this
conversation but here's a persuasion tip
for you but I'll tell you one thing that
they would
appreciate because everybody
does a better
idea opinions are worthless if you're
not in isal making
decisions
but maybe a
suggestion so that's what I'm going to
do I'm going to make a
suggestion if it's one that they had not
considered then that's additive it
doesn't mean that they would use
anything I suggest but you would have
this one minor
benefit it would open your
imagination to more than the options
that we see now because the options that
I see are that you could never put the
Palestinians back into
Gaza the situation will just be
recreated because you've got a million
children who have already been
radicalized right just put them back it
just regrows into Hamas 2 so you can't
have that because Theos 2 would have it
better weapons because you know
technology moves
forward and you can't leave it empty
because then it it's
genocide um so what do you do so here's
where I'm going to add a suggestion for
what to do you know once once a moss has
been
neutralized in
2023 how do how do you build a better
place here's my
suggestion since you can never have the
um Palestinians in charge
of Gaza again I think there's no way
that'll ever happen again but you also
can't have Israel in
charge because then it's you know that's
a bad look and it's bad in a lot of ways
but here's what you might be able to do
um you might be able to uh get Saudi
Arabia to take custodial control of Gaza
not own it and be under a security
umbrella that is purely Israel so the
you know the police and the military and
the borders all Israel the intelligence
all Israel but you would ask Saudi
Arabia to be the adult in the room do
you think Saudi Arabia would like to be
framed as the peacemaking adult in the
room I'm going to say yes because I
think NBS the Crown Prince who you know
we don't forgive him for his bone sawing
but at the same time he clearly is a um
Progressive not in the way we use it
here but he's certainly willing to look
at things and change them in a different
way than what is going before he is a
dealmaker he seems to be able to work
with Netanyahu and he was interested in
some kind of an accord with Israel that
is now on hold because of this situation
but given that we know Saudi Arabia and
Israel had a an interest in reaching an
accord in the first place I'm sure they
still do they wish that this had not
happened and given that the Hamas was
trying to probably stop that Accord from
going through the the number one thing
you'd want to do is not let them win
which is to stop
progress so here's what you do you
say um we can't go forward under our
current conditions but let us add a
sweetener to the deal and the sweetener
is Saudi we would love you to be sort of
the the stewards in much the way you are
the stewards of the Holy lands right
Saudi Arabia already has the uh the
respect of the rest of the Muslim world
because they control the holy lands and
I think you'd agree they do a good job
of it right because there's massive you
know uh annual migrations to see the
holy lands and it largely
works right so I think they have this
unique
role in the Islamic world as sort of the
being above it all you know being a
little bit above the politics of it
controlling the religious faith and I
think they could do that in uh
Gaza I think they could be a
credible
custodian as long as they're not in
charge of the security because Israel's
going never let go of that I
assume now I would would add to that um
that they should have an A an idea of
what a rebuilt Gaza looks
like and if you imagine that they came
up with a stable situation with a Saudi
custodial control that's the key word
custodial you know so it's not ownership
it's just responsibility basically
um do you think that would attract
investment I think so I think you could
attract investment if you had a stable
situation that um prevented Hamas from
taking
power um do you think that it would be
time especially with the Saudis having
an interest in nuclear
energy and Israel having capabilities
don't you think it's time to put a
nuclear power plant in Gaza so they can
desalinate so that the you know their
water is not controlled by somebody else
but well in fact Israel would still have
control but um it would also give them
electricity and it would give that to
them at a reasonable price now you might
say to yourself but Scott nobody wants a
nuclear power plant in their backyard
well I think the Gaza residents have
seen more risk than a nuclear power
plant the type of which has never had a
meltdown you know the modern versions I
think they would take that risk I mean I
don't think that
they're you know scientifically
morons so I think they would take that
risk so imagine if you will uh a new
Gaza built with Green Tech um turned
into basically
Switzerland for that
area Switzerland for that
area
and maybe they're the place that other
uh Islamic uh people who are escaping
from let's say whatever Badness is in
their own area maybe it's a place that
refugees
go because you know of course you'd have
to vet them pretty
carefully but uh that's my suggestion my
suggestion is to have a uh to create an
image of what the end state looks like
create a positive image of what the end
state looks like if you can get people
to debate the end State then you've made
them think past the Carnage Carnage is
guaranteed but you could rebuild Gaza as
a you know a Resort
destination high standard of living you
know model of how to recreate things not
too far from actually uh Trump's idea of
building a Greenfield City from scratch
in the United States on government land
I'm all about that because I think one
of the biggest the biggest things in the
future is that if you start from scratch
using modern technology and Green
Technology you could build something
like we've never built
before a city you could design it from
scratch and it would be the best living
conditions in the world now if this were
America you'd already be yelling 15
minute cities don't let the
WF turn me into a globalist slave well I
don't think you I don't think they're
worried about that in
Gaza probably not thinking about that
too much so maybe they just like to have
a really really good city and guess
something at the end of this that
wouldn't have been possible
otherwise all
right and again it's not it's not that I
think that that's the specific good idea
just just to summarize it's about making
people think creatively it's about
getting the brainstorm and going it's
about understanding that design is
Destiny you can design something that
would last the way Gaza was designed it
was guaranteed to get to this
point very
predictable uh let's just leave this
radicalized group here to do what they
want and talk about how they want to
kill us until they have the capabilities
to actually make an attack how is it not
going to happen right how is it not
going to happen of course it was so
design something that doesn't have that
guaranteed outcome then maybe you have
something
all
right um I'm going to come back to this
story about uh you saw the V ramaswami
was on Hannity and they disagreed about
something that uh was viv's past opinion
now I care so little about what the
actual topic was because it's not
relevant to my point that I'm just going
to ignore it because it doesn't matter
to
anything but I'm just going to give you
this tip hity kept saying to V who was
arguing that uh he was being
misinterpreted uh H he kept saying those
are your exact words those are your
exact words th th that's verbatim this
is you verbatim those are exact words
now if I could teach you anything about
fake news when you hear anybody left or
right saying those were your exact words
they are the
liar
because they're not saying those are all
of the words you've said about this had
they said these are all the words you've
ever said about this what are we
supposed to think then I would think
that's an argument now that's an
argument these are all the words you've
ever said on this topic and when I look
at them they give me a certain
impression so how do you explain that
that would be hard to rebut but if you
say these specific words are your exact
words that is is the strongest
tell that the person saying that is just
trying to trap you and they know that
they're doing it so Hannity I'm really
disappointed in you because I had very
high opinion of his
skills his skill sack is incredible
skill I said sack uh stack is incredible
yeah he's one of the most talented
people on
TV all right and that
ladies and
gentlemen brings us to a strong strong
finish to what I think is the greatest
live stream you're going to see all
morning today because probably it's the
only one you're going to see
and I'm gonna I'm gonna stick with that
opinion all
right um possibly the best live stream
ever that's
true
this would all stop if Scott stopped
watching and keeping cable news alive is
it me I'm the one keeping cable news
Alive by all of my
watching my 10 minutes of watching
yesterday all right uh ladies and
gentlemen thank you oh it looks like I'm
getting good comments over here on
YouTube and
Twitter thank you for
that um YouTube is getting more and
more questionable in terms of How It's
treating me so they've been doing some
demonetizing but uh of my videos lately
for reasons that they don't state so
it's always unstated now the things I'm
talking about I'm pretty sure similar to
what everybody's talking about I don't
think I've
departed have I departed
from I haven't violated any terms of
service ever not ever and I've never
even had a warning do you know
that that's worth mentioning I've never
had a warning on any social media
platform because I'm really careful and
and I actually uh I appreciate the terms
of service I'm glad there are terms of
service and I am happy to stay within
them you know Deal's a deal if that's
the deal that I signed up for yeah I'm
happy to stay within the lines that I I
it's not an accident that I've never had
a you know any any kind of official
warning or anything um
however I don't know if I'm being Shadow
banned or throttled in some way because
I can imagine the advertisers do not
love um content about the
war even though 100% of the news is
content about the war so but maybe maybe
YouTube has more options you know they
don't have to sell advertising on war
content but it could be also that
there's some part of my message that
somebody doesn't like being out I don't
know which part in
particular it it does seem that no
matter how many subscribers I have on
YouTube my my Revenue you know the part
this monetized based on Advertising has
stayed almost the same no matter what
the subscriber number is so I don't know
it looks like I'm being slowly forced
down that's that's the impression I get
I can't confirm that but the impression
I get is that I'm slowly being you know
pushed out now I would go immediately to
um another platform um well I probably
will as soon as I can get the tech
working the way I
want so I'll probably at some point move
to
rumble um and off of
YouTube at least for live streams but
we're not there yet there's a little
more Tech work I think that needs to be
done to make that a smooth
transition all right uh who's watching
our Southern border well we seem to have
surrendered the southern
border
yeah yeah I'm
I'm
uh K can frame you as both an Israel
hater and a
Palestinian all right uh that's all for
now ladies and gentlemen over on X and
YouTube I'm G to say goodbye to you and
I will see you back
tomorrow bye for now
