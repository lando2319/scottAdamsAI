[Applause]
hey everybody
come on in come on in i don't want to
get your
hopes up but i have a feeling
that this will be the best coffee with
scott adams
of all time yeah i just have that
feeling
and if you'd like to hear about uh warm
apple pie and sunshine
well you came to the right place but
that's the decoy
we'll be talking about the headlines as
always
but before we get to the simultaneous
set and i know you're waiting for that
i'd like to give you a few sources for a
future
uh research on your own there's a lot of
talk about the
so-called bat human interface
that's being was studied at the wuhan
lab apparently
if you'd like to do your own research on
the bat human interface i can recommend
two movies number one walking tall
the bat human interface and also dracula
another good source for the bat human
interface and third
uh an ozzy osbourne concert
if you're american you probably
understand all of those clever
references
if you're not consult a friend
well i think it's time time for
what yes the simultaneous step and all
you need is a
copper mug or a glass a tanker tell us
to sign a canteen sugar flask of vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here the day
the thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous
sip and it's going to happen now all
over the universe at the same time
go
all right people remember i've told you
that your opinions
are sometimes assigned to you by the
media
it feels like you're coming up with your
own opinions
but probably not now i'm not
exempt from this i assume that i'm
subject to the same forces
but it's easier to see it in other
people
you can see other people's mistakes
easier than you can see your own
that's how we're designed and i would
submit
that one way you could determine
that your views are assigned to you by
the media
is if they assign you two views that
conflict
in other words two things that can't
both be true
and you accept both of them right
wouldn't you say that would be a good
test to find out if your opinions
are self self-generated or if they're
actually assigned it to you by the media
if the if the media gave you two
opinions that you accepted
you accepted both of them but they're in
direct conflict
don't you think that would be a good
test well let's test it
let's see how many of you here uh and
let's see if anybody i'm not sure
anybody will fall into this category
but let's just test it how many of you
in the comments tell me
how many of you believe the pandemic
began when
a deadly weaponized virus or at least
one that they were working on for the
purposes of
gain of function escaped from the wuhan
lab it was a deadly pandemic
weaponized virus escaped from the wuhan
lab
how many believe that that is probably
true
yeah you don't have to be completely
certain just give me a probably true
yes yes yes probably yes yes yes yes
looks like almost universally people are
saying
probably true right yeah we're waiting
for
something that would tell us for sure
but almost unanimous
all right so so we seem to unanimously
believe the people watching this live
stream
that the pandemic was started when a
deadly weaponized virus escaped from the
wuhan lab
all right that's that's belief number
one now i'm going to do a different
belief
all right we're going to stop your stop
you're answering the first one
we're going to go to the second belief
belief number two
the coronavirus of this past year
uh is basically just a bad flu
in the comments how many of you believe
that the coronavirus and covet 19
are overdone and that they're basically
just a bad flu
i'm watching the comments go by
all right a lot of no's good a lot of
no's
but there are strangely quite a few
yeses
so if you said yes you think it was a
deadly pandemic that started at the
wuhan lab
but you do not believe that it's a
harmless virus well that's that's
consistent
that would be a consistent opinion and
it would be consistent with
doesn't prove it but it would be
consistent with the hypothesis
that you make up your own opinions so if
your opinion
is consistent and there's no conflict
it might be your own opinion there would
be no way to tell that it was
necessarily
assigned to you by the media
but if you believe both of these things
that it's a deadly virus that escaped
from a lab
and it's also not a deadly virus
you've got some explaining to do
right that would show you that your
opinions just came from tv
because fox news holds both of these
views
the opinion people not the news people
so when i talk about fox news
i'm talking about the opinion people the
opinion people
i think can you do a fact check on me
tell me if this is if i'm going too far
is it fair to say that the opinion
people on fox news
are telling you that the virus probably
came out of a
kind of a weaponization process
to become a deadly escape virus and also
at the same time it's just a normal flu
but a little bit worse
can't both be true they can't
you gotta pick one if you believe both
of those things
i believe you could say for sure your
opinion came from tv
and did not come from your own your own
thoughts
all right here's uh some good news
in the comments tell me in the comments
i want to see how well informed you are
because we're all watching the news
right probably every person who's
watching this live stream
also consumes a good deal of news
and given that the biggest story in the
world is still
covered how many people approximately
without checking
okay no cheating don't check any sources
tell me how many people died uh let's
say
on average the average number of people
who died
per day in the united states only
not the world just the united states how
many people died per day in the past
week
from covet just off the top of your head
because you all consume news and it's
the biggest story in the world
so how many was it somebody said
fifty seventeen fourteen hundred a
thousand
ten um
people saying three a thousand three
hundred fifty
fifteen hundred all right here's the
number
this is uh cnn's reporting it said that
in the past
week in the united states there have
been 427 deaths
that would average out to 61
per day 61.
61. do you know
what we were weren't we up to like 3 000
or something
at one point what was our peak 3 000 per
day i think
we're down to 61. do you know how
cnn reported this low low number
they had to add the whole week together
so it would be over a hundred they had
to report it as 427 deaths over the past
seven days
they couldn't report the daily deaths
because they're too low and it would
make you not get a vaccination
probably i'm assuming that part of their
thinking was the public good
i hope and that they were trying to
trying to not report it as the good news
that it is
because it might cause you to act
differently and you know
i can understand that that would be a
responsible thing to do but it does
appear that they have
added the whole week together to get
over a hundred
because if it's not over a hundred
you're not going to care
if it's not over a hundred per day
you're not going to care are you
it's just too small and
what do you feel is the accuracy
of counting covet deaths i i know i'm
leading i'm leading you to the obvious
answer do you think that we've always
been really good at counting covet
deaths
no no of course not we've never been
good at counting kova deaths
what do you think what do you think
would be the relative
accuracy let's say you were not so good
at counting
covet deaths but you're trying really
hard you know you're trying
to do your best to count them right but
you're not that accurate
how how many miscounts would you expect
per day from the number of people who
die per day
how many of them would you expect might
be a misdiagnosed
cove of death i don't know maybe
maybe about 61 per day i feel like
we're down to the level where the
the real number of deaths is very close
to the number that we miscount
now i'm not suggesting that none of them
are real but
you're getting to the level where it's
just lost in the rounding
like it might not even be real at this
point
i mean we could be down to zero and we
wouldn't even know it
we're not down to zero but the point is
that we're we're the numbers are so low
that they're going to be really hard to
count because you're not really
sure you're getting them all right so
that's
amazing news and the the reporting also
says
listen to how cnn reports this the good
news comes as about 42 percent of
americans are fully vaccinated
that doesn't sound like much does it i
mean it's great compared to zero
but 42 fully vaccinated that's not like
great uh while 52 percent have received
at least
one dose a little bit better but you
know not that 70 percent we're looking
for
but here's what they don't report
if we've got 42 percent of americans
fully vaccinated
we have all of the vulnerable ones
vaccinated
who want to be vaccinated right
basically all of the people who have
risk
and want to be vaccinated are vaccinated
um oh interesting
trudy's got an interesting question here
i'll let me get to that in a minute
um so anyway that's your situation i
think we may be really really in good
shape here
but the news is trying to be responsible
trying to make sure you get your
vaccination i understand the motivation
to that so i
i don't mind this kind of fake news
you know this is fake news in my opinion
because they're they're shading the news
you know toward a bias to cause you to
act in a certain way
but i feel like it's responsible enough
right you know i'm okay with this level
of fake news uh
judy asked said that uh that
pleasanton's had some success
getting addicts off the street but i
don't know about that
um i don't know how many were on the
street to begin with in pleasanton but
i'll look into that maybe there's
something there cnn says there's a
mystery that there's no
seasonal flu this year you already you
already knew that news right
you knew that in the united states the
number of
regular flu deaths was basically zero
in the past year and you said to
yourself well that makes sense
because if we're doing all this
mitigation for coronavirus
which is far more viral
we probably would get rid of the regular
flu because kids are not going to school
especially and they're the ones who get
the regular flu and bring it home
so make sense but there's a new mystery
to add to
the fact that america did not have any
regular flu deaths this year and the
mystery is this
it happened in every country
no matter what they did let me say that
again
the disappearance of regular flu
happened in every country no matter what
they did
whether they closed down whether they
used masks no matter what they did
none of them they all had zero
when they counted them do you know that
the regular flu the seasonal flu that we
get every year
we don't count those deaths we estimate
them
based on the extra people dying who
don't buy
who don't die during the non-flu season
it's an
estimate when you count them
they're not there now a year ago i told
you i believed
that we would learn that the regular flu
deaths were always fake
that they were never real and i based it
on this observation
that the number of people who allegedly
die from the regular seasonal flu every
year
is in that fifty to eighty thousand a
year range
the number of people who die of fentanyl
overdoses
the same range fifty to seventy thousand
why is it that we all know somebody who
died of a fentanyl overdose
but almost none of us have ever heard of
somebody dying of the regular flu
am i right how many of you have heard
of a fentanyl overdose somebody you know
i obviously
hit me close to home but i also know
other people
who died of fentanyl overdoses not not
just my own stepson
right now somebody said their grand
their grandfather did so to me i don't
understand
why there's one that i hear about all
the time and one that i've never heard
of in my entire life not once
not a single case i'm not saying they
don't exist i'm saying i've never heard
of one
so how could those numbers be about the
same
when one you hear all the time and one
you just don't hear about
could it be because it's old people
dying of the flu
so you don't talk about them because it
just looks natural whereas a young
person dying of a fentanyl overdose
feels like
a bigger a bigger deal maybe it's that
maybe but i suspected that the
regular flu deaths were always fake and
i believe that once we know
that as soon as you're counting them
they've disappeared everywhere
certainly suggests that's the case now
the other hypothesis
is that all of the regular flu deaths
are being called coronavirus deaths this
year
is that possible in the comments give me
give me the opinion which do you think
is more likely
that there were never really any
substantial
seasonal flu deaths or that there were
just as many this year
but they were attributed to covet
um i'm seeing a lot of people buying
into the
misattributed to covent but
for those of you who think the problem
is that they were misattributed to covet
how do you explain this
kids didn't get the flu
now remember the kids are not
necessarily the ones who are dying from
the flu so much
i mean it happens but not so much but
the children
it's not that they didn't die they
didn't get it
it's not even just the deaths that are
missing
the children didn't get it if we were
miscounting
covert deaths there would still be
plenty of children with the flu
they just wouldn't be dying but they'd
have the flu
now of course people are saying well
that's because there's no school scott
but how do you explain it in the other
countries
where there was school remember
no matter what this the country did none
of them had flu
deaths but did they even have flu
i'm going to say that they didn't have
the flu either
because if they did have the flu maybe
they would have had the flu
deaths so
is it possible that children in other
countries where there was school
are having seasonal flu just like normal
but nobody's dying because they're all
mis
attributed to uh to covet i'm not sure
that we have a final answer but i'm
going to stick with my prediction
that we're going to find out that deaths
from the regular seasonal flu
do exist but they're so rare
that they were vastly overestimated
before
i'm not saying it doesn't happen i'm
saying vastly overestimated
all right here's the biggest thing
that's coming
in the future and it's so big i don't
know if we can quite even
grasp how big this is going to be and
it's the change in
transportation everything about
transportation is ready to change
i'm not sure if you've quite put it all
together
here are just some of the things that
are massively going to change because of
transportation
evolution number one commuting
wouldn't you agree
mike says every time he goes to the
doctor
with feeling horrible they tell him he
has the flu but they don't test for it
i don't even know if there is a test for
the regular flu
but anyway so in transportation
commuting
is almost a thing of the past for a lot
of jobs
because the internet is now so strong
and
zoom calls are so normal and the
pandemic got us used to not commuting
so commuting has probably forever
changed right
some some people will go back to the
office but i think the idea of
driving to the office as a requirement
it's just forever gone
so there's that number two delivery
of everything so the delivery
you know services will just keep getting
better and easier and
more irresistible at this point i have
tremendous amount of things delivered
that's not going to change so all the
reasons you had to go to the store
just went away but you also have
self-driving cars coming nothing can
stop this
if you're saying to yourself i don't
think there will ever be self-driving
cars
because they won't be safe enough or
they they uh
i don't know won't be approved people
won't feel comfortable with them none of
that's going to happen
self-driving cars are 100 guaranteed
there's no way around it we're going to
have them
and they're they're slowly a number of
companies working themselves through the
permitting and testing
phase now something that i heard elon
musk
say is is a good context for this
in order to have self-driving cars you
would have to have
computers in the cars that are strong
enough and we do the computers that are
already
in new cars are strong enough to do
everything
a self-driving car needs so that's done
basically number two you need to have
enough camera systems to see everything
you need to see
that's done the teslas for example have
all the cameras you would need
to be a self-driving car they already
have that the other thing you need
which would help would be if they're all
electric
because i think it would be easier for
an autonomous car to
sell fuel if it's electric
i'm just guessing because you don't have
any liquid that might you know
catch on fire or anything so i'm just
guessing that being electric is going to
be a big part of
autonomous not all of them but maybe
most of them
and then the other big change is the
density
and efficiency of batteries the battery
efficiency is just
every year better and better and better
and no end in sight
it looks like batteries will just keep
getting better and lighter
and more powerful and we're now right at
the crossover point
where electric airplanes are economical
airplanes and not only electric
airplanes but
your own private little uh you know
drone-like helicopter
flying car now i'm not sure you'll have
your own flying car
probably there'll be some sporty ones
i don't think you could have your own
car to commute but you're definitely
going to have flying taxis
i would say the odds of having flying
taxis as a regular feature of life
are close to 100 percent at this point
and it's going to be pretty soon so you
can have
cheap electric flying vehicles and
autonomous cars and no commuting and
everything's going to be delivered
everything about transportation is going
to change and just in a few years
on twitter twitter user donald luskin
says he did a did a
data analysis of masks and found that
masks work
but he could find no correlation with uh
social distancing
in other words where mask mandates were
in place there seemed to be a noticeably
big difference in infections but where
you had
social distancing that did not come out
i don't understand that
because i don't know of a situation
where you would ever have a mask
requirement where you would not also
have a distancing requirement
or at least a distancing practice right
if you put a mask
on you're kind of automatically also
going to stand at a distance from people
because it's all part of the same
mindset right so i don't know how you
could
how you could imagine that masks work
but distancing doesn't
it feels like the data would show either
they both work
or neither work but i feel like they
travel as a pair
even if the law doesn't require it just
people would act that way
but i ask you this if the numbers showed
the social distancing didn't make any
difference to infections
would that tell you that so that social
distancing doesn't work
or would it tell you that numbers don't
work
i'd like to see your opinion on this in
the comments
this is just a hypothetical because i
don't know this to be the case
but hypothetically if the numbers showed
that social distancing didn't change the
infection rate
what would you assume would you assume
the analysis was
obviously wrong or would you assume that
social distancing doesn't work
i'm looking at your comments i'm seeing
yeah
numbers don't work numbers rarely work
uh not commenting on this one studies
are biased
numbers are wrong yeah i don't see any
logical way
that social distancing could fail
am i right about that it just feels to
me that social distancing is the most
obvious thing that would work every time
to some degree
right not a hundred percent but how do
you get the virus if you're not around
somebody who has it
i would just assume the numbers are
wrong so
keep that in mind
president biden is making his first
international travel and
i'm glad he is because
he's taking on some of the big problems
in the world so he's visiting
the united kingdom belgium and
switzerland
uh those are three hotspots in the world
and
if you know if you want your president
working on the big priorities
you want him to be going to the united
kingdom
belgium and switzerland because as you
know that's where most of our problems
come from those three the big three
sort of the axis of extreme evil the
united kingdom belgium and switzerland
so it's a good thing that biden is going
there first um
you know not doing something useless
like uh
president trump you know visiting kim
jong-un and
stopping a nuclear war
but we've got some important topics also
with these countries
and i got a preview of some of the
topics that biden will be discussing
when he visits the uk belgium and
switzerland so here are the three things
on the top of his list
number one cold toast why
number two a chocolate treaty got to
talk about that
and number three topic is uh which one
is belgium
so i think those are the three topics uh
biden will be talking about
we'll keep watching that there's a
speaking of biden's hunter biden is in
the news one of his
some of his emails a part reportedly use
the n-word
the n-word and not only does he use the
n-word but he
uses it in reference to his lawyer
uh-oh who's white who's white his
lawyer's white
uh so hunter biden calls his white
lawyer the n word
but not the n word ending with er
but the n word ending with g a
sort of more you know not not the not
the full proper word
and people have rightly said can you
imagine
can you even imagine if
you know one of the trump kids
said something like this and it came out
can you even imagine
okay first of all that's a fair comment
if this exact same thing
had happened with uh don jr it would be
the only news there wouldn't be any
other news
however let me say this
it's just fake news now it's a real
event the
i'm sure the email was real i'm sure he
really used the word
but can we really get excited
about two white people talking privately
about anything
now i suppose if they were planning a
terrorist attack
i'd probably care about that but
i don't think that as a standard we
should be looking at private
communications or
communications they expected to be
private
and have any opinion at all about a
private conversation
here's the opinion you should have about
this nothing
it's none of your business right
it's none of your business what
two people said privately to each other
none of your business and it
doesn't reveal any
racism if it did maybe that would be
news right
but it doesn't reveal anything there's
nothing about his
hunter's secret thoughts there's nothing
about his belief
of anything it's a non-story
you know i'm i would be happy to dump on
him
if there were anything to this but there
isn't
it's just you know political fun so it's
fun to
i guess it's fun to make fun of hunter
biden
uh but you know i do have some some
empathy for his
his addiction problems for in particular
um
i mean that's that's nothing to joke
about but
let the guy make a bad joke you know if
you want to say his personality is
defective
we all have defective personalities
i would make absolutely nothing of this
story
apparently joe biden is not much of a
negotiator because he can't get an
infrastructure deal so the negotiations
have broken down
now how hard is it to negotiate a deal
when everybody is in favor of the deal
feels like the easiest thing you could
do right
hey how would you like to do x
i love x let's do x right away
okay let's negotiate x
i agree with x you agree with x let's
come together and do x
apparently biden couldn't get that done
uh he and his
winged monkeys have added so much to the
infrastructure bill that
the republicans can't call it
infrastructure anymore
and so they say we're walking away
good job republicans so now republicans
have stopped
how many things help me with how many
things the republicans have stopped
they stopped the investigation of the
january 6
riot they stopped infrastructure so far
we'll see where that goes and there was
a
third thing what was the other thing
that they stopped recently
i'm trying to remember but as long as
joe manchin
is in favor of the
of the what you call it
oh hr one yes the voting uh the voting
changes so republicans have a pretty
good record
and um with the filibuster i'm sorry
that's the word i couldn't think of
so as long as joe manchin is in favor of
the filibuster
and he's kind of the tie breaker on a
lot of this stuff
i think we're in good shape we're in
good shape
what do you think of the odds that
biden's going to push through his
tax increases
it kind of looks lower doesn't it
i feel like the odds of that are low
because if the republicans can stop
three things in a row including
infrastructure
they can definitely stop a gigantic tax
increase
can't they i feel like that would be the
the slow ball pitch
if a republican can do anything they can
rail against high taxes so i'm feeling
optimistic
that the taxes won't go up as much as
they could have
but one of the things that biden is
doing uh well
and i'm gonna have to compliment them i
hate to do it
you know i know you don't like it but
i'm gonna compliment
uh biden on this persuasive thing
he's asking for so much in terms of tax
increases
it's a good opening offer because
you know at this point if he only got
half of what he's asking for
i would still feel absolutely abused
but i would feel like it wasn't as bad
as it could have been which is exactly
why you make the first
big ask so at least he did that right
he's got plenty of room to negotiate
um here's a statistic today from some
survey
20 20 of democrats
um lost a friendship over politics
versus 10 of republicans in recent i
guess a recent year or so
and so twice as many democrats lost a
friend
compared to republicans over politics
to which i say how is that possible
how is it possible that there could be
twice as many democrats losing a friend
than republicans doesn't that mean that
the democrats are turning on each other
because if the only friends people lost
were the opposite party
it would be the same number right
because if i'm a democrat and i lose you
as a friend as a republican
that's one one republican lost a friend
and one democrat lost a friend
that's the same number how do you get
twice as many democrats losing a friend
unless they've turned on each other
right am i doing the math wrong
i feel like that's the only way you get
there i don't know how once you could
have a double number the democrats have
to be turning on themselves
i think right i don't know any other way
to interpret that
all right so also same survey
33 of liberal women ended friendships
over politics
33 do you know what the biggest
complaint of women is
adult women do you know what their
biggest personal complaint
don't have friends
let me ask you in the comments how many
women
so this is just a question for women
women only how many of you have
a real problem finding a friend
or making more friends so do you have a
friend
deficit that is really obvious to you
like ah i don't have enough friends
how many of you have that situation
going on right now
i see one i do yes nope
nope yes no yes yep
very much no no problem not really
no no me no no no yes
yep it's hard no yes so you can see it's
very mixed
i wouldn't assume that it's equally
mixed but you can see it's big
it's a big problem so one of the biggest
problems that i've
heard people talk about is the lack of
being able to find a friend
and 33 percent of liberal women have
ended friendships over politics
can they afford to lose friends can any
of us
can any of us afford to lose friends
it's hard to make a friend
yeah look at all the lonely people
let me change the question instead of
just
friends because that could be a little
murky in terms of how you're answering
it
let me ask you this how many of you
would consider yourselves
lonely so in the comments
how many of you consider yourselves
lonely
like right now in this part of your life
uh i'm saying yes no no no
no no no no no mostly knows interesting
no somebody says today yes i do
mostly knows interesting i was expecting
a few more yeses
and i wonder if this is a conservative
bias
i know most of my uh oh you know what
the other bias
is most of my viewers are male uh i
think
men are a little less likely to say
they're lonely
yeah alone but not lonely
somebody's enjoying their loneliness or
their alone time
i could get a friend if i wanted that
feels like a male
male perspective doesn't it i think a
man would say
yeah i'm lonely but i could get a friend
if i wanted so so my own damn fault
all right interesting well it's not as
bad as i thought it would be but that
could be a reflection of my audience
it's a biased audience all right here is
a
so the bottom line on this is that the
fake news is causing a mental health
crisis
and part of this crisis is that people
are losing friends
and you can't really afford to lose
friends in this world
because you might go down to zero so
that's a big deal i would like to
direct you to a fascinating article by
jason andrews on his blog
parsingpersuasion.com
so i tweeted it so you can see it on my
twit twitter feed toward the top today
and the basic idea which i'm not going
to get into the details
but the basic idea is that what we're
seeing in terms of the wokeness and
critical race theory
and you know the the let's say the
social politics of the day
that this is perfectly suited for
marxism to essentially get a grip
now i had been trying to figure out why
people were saying critical race theory
is a marxist idea
because i couldn't i couldn't figure out
how that works
because marxism seemed like a political
system or a political
economic system whereas
um whereas critical race theory
just seemed like a social thing and i i
couldn't figure
them out figure out how they fit jason
has some fascinating ideas
about how people get imprinted
early in life and these imprints from
either a strong
or weak mother or father can cause
different personality types
and if you cause one personality type
you are vulnerable to
a change in system and another
personality type
you're less vulnerable to a change in
system be it marxism or something else
and that the recent changes have primed
people for a change in system now i
don't know how
i have no evidence that any of that's
intentional meaning i don't really know
that there's some smart people
sitting behind a you know a desk
somewhere who figured out
if we do this and this and this and wait
30 years
it'll be perfect for marxism to take
over
i don't know maybe maybe maybe there's
somebody doing that
i tend to not believe the people are so
clever they plan 30 years in advance
i i tend not to believe that but
anything's possible
we have seen interviews from soviet
defectors saying that they have these
long-term plans to
destroy the united states culture etc
maybe so i would just uh um
suggest that you read jason andrew's
piece on that make up your own mind
but it looks i think there's something
there
you know i might need to read it again
but
i think there's something there rand
paul gets a big win today
he'd been saying that you don't need a
vaccination
talk about himself really you don't need
a vaccination if you've already
had the covet infection and it's
confirmed
but a new study comes out cleveland
clinic study of over 52 000 employees
showed that the unvaccinated people who
have had coven 19 had no difference in
reinfection rate
than people who had covered and took the
vaccine
so there was no difference so the
vaccine
added zero extra protection
but but as ian
martus might tell you there might be a
difference in how long they last
so it could be that rand paul is
completely right
at the moment it could also be true
that in six to nine months that people
who had the infection
but not the vaccination might have less
protection
we don't know if that will translate
into actually
more infections but the i think the
what we know about it is that the
vaccination the double vaccination gives
you more protection
than just being infected by it
i also don't know if uh the variants
make any difference to this
does does having one version of covid
give you just as good protection against
the variants
as having the vaccine that was sort of
designed
to take care of it which one does the
variance better
so i still have some questions about
this but i think i think we can give
rand paul the whim
would you agree you know i feel like
it's not a 100
win because it could be a difference in
how well protected you are
in the long run in the short run it
looks like he's just right
right when you say that in the short run
he's just right
in the long run we don't know yet that's
a little bit more of an open question
but if i had to put a bet on it
if i had to put my money on it i think
i'd bet on rand paul on this one
i think i would bet that the natural
immunity is
good enough even if it's not as good
um are you watching
are you watching this story about new
york times editorial board member
mara gay said something about
trump supporters politicizing the
american flag
and if you like the
flag you probably said to yourself
how do you politicize a flag
because the whole point of the flag is
for everybody
like that's what it is but apparently
people on the left
think that the full embrace of the
american flag
by people on the right suggests that
it's becoming sort of a racist symbol
or a divisive symbol to which i say
who made that happen i don't think it
was the republicans loving the flag
that turned it bad wasn't it the fact
that democrats were stomping on it and
burning it
that made it not their flag it wasn't
the republicans that made it not their
flag
it was the people who kneel when the
flag is flying
it's the people burn it people who
disrespect it
how do you blame this on the republicans
the republicans always loved the flag
they never didn't love it but the
democrats
and the left are certainly demonizing it
so if it becomes
a divisive symbol who did that
the republicans just by being exactly
the way they always were
did they make something happen by being
exactly the same as always
that's what happened no if something has
changed
you'd have to look to the people who
changed
it wasn't the republicans i don't see
any republicans flying extra flags
really i don't think so
although i have seen a lot of flags i'm
going to say that in my town
how many of you noticed this in my town
we're still
a good distance away from the fourth of
july but there are
more american flags right can you
confirm that i'm noticing more
and i don't know if those are
republicans who are sort of sending in a
bat signal or
something i don't know all right let's
talk about
uh trump apparently trump wrote a
press release congratulating nigeria for
banning twitter
and he said because they banned their
president and
trump said perhaps i should have done
that while president so trump is
actually talking about
banning twitter because twitter banned
him
and uh i tell you
you don't realize how much you miss
trump until you see him say
anything everything trump says
is more interesting than anything
anybody else says
and how does he do this so consistently
how does he do it so consistently um
i mean this is the most provocative
thing anybody said today
and he's always the one who says it so
man is he good at this
the provocative stuff anyway uh
here's an update on ivor mektin i i gave
i told you the story that
brett weinstein and others a lot of
others
are talking about how the studies on
ivermectin
although individually the studies may be
imperfect if you did a meta-analysis
they they seem to point strongly in one
direction
but you don't even need the
meta-analysis you can just look at all
the studies and say
uh they all point in the same direction
some of them might be flawed some of
them might be flawed in different ways
but they all point the same direction so
um this point i don't think i made
clearly when i was talking about it
before while i don't believe
that meta analyses are the
magic bullet i don't believe a
meta-analysis
should necessarily be trusted
but that said with the evidence that we
have
if you have to decide what to do about
your own health
and you've got a well-known drug with
basically zero risk
and all this evidence that's not perfect
but it's really really really strong
might be wrong but it looks kind of
right
and there's no risk and the expense is
minimal
compared to the benefit if you have any
it's a no-brainer in terms of risk
risk reward so if you're telling me what
should you do
well the risk reward is obvious there's
no risk
really and there's really really good
evidence that it might work
but i have to use might because we're
just short of proof
right there's no doubt about it it
should be treated as
something you take seriously now even
today there was yet another
story about hydroxychloroquine
potentially
having some benefit and some study again
same thing i don't believe science is
agreed that hydroxychloroquine works
i believe the consensus is still that it
doesn't
but i might i might
if you think my alarm's going to go off
uh that's not
every day there's something i need to do
on
some days that i don't need to do on
other days and today's not a day i need
to do it
some some people say it's the zinc well
i don't know i think zink's been tested
as well all right so
there's also a thought that the real
problem with ivermectin
is that if there if we had a therapy
that worked
you couldn't have gotten the vaccination
emergency authorities
what do you think of that apparently
there's some kind of rule in place
that says you can't do an emergency
authorization of a drug
the way we did with the vaccinations if
there's some existing drug
that's already approved that could do
the job
because you would just use the existing
one you wouldn't you wouldn't need to do
an emergency authorization
and so there's some thinking that that's
the only reason the divermectin
was shown to be not true or considered
not a treatment
is just to make way for the vaccinations
my opinion on that
is that's ridiculous i believe that's
ridiculous
here's why uh hey president
trump or president biden you could fill
in any president okay
so this is independent of personality
whoever is president
hey if we do an emergency authorization
for these things we can't say ivermectin
works but we think it does
what does the president say no matter
who the president is
oh well let's change that here's an
executive order
maybe somebody says oh you can't do an
executive order for this you need a
i don't know some other kind of law
maybe
congress or whatever now what would
people say oh
well let's change that law it's an
emergency it's a crisis
no president would let that stand
i don't believe there's any level of
incompetence
that a president would let that stand in
an emergency
if this were not an emergency the
bureaucracy does what the bureaucracy
does
and i could totally understand that the
bureaucracy would do something stupid
but in an emergency all those stupid
things are presented to the chief
executive
and then the chief executive gets to say
yeah that doesn't make any sense in the
emergency
if these were normal days yeah but not
in an emergency
so then the the chief executive would
just change that law
or ignore it or something but to imagine
that such a bureaucratic uh rule
would actually stop us from you know
putting a a hammer lock on the pandemic
with drugs we already have no
i refuse to believe in
that level of incompetence i can believe
in a lot of incompetence
i literally made my living pointing out
the massive
baseline incompetence of big
organizations
no one is more famous for pointing out
the inefficiencies and problems with
large organization decisions
i'm literally the most famous person in
the country for doing exactly that thing
and even i don't think that's even
possible
i do not believe that anybody in charge
said no we can't do this because then we
couldn't do the vaccinations don't i
don't believe it for one
second it is so far from being in my
opinion
so far from being a possible thing that
happened
i just i'm not even gonna consider the
possibility
all right um
yes i did listen to dr corey's testimony
here's one thing i never believe
the uh the rogue doctor who's the only
one who can see
what everybody else can't see if i were
to give you a category of thing
you shouldn't believe it's this
the rogue doctor who is very persuasive
and he's looking at numbers and he's an
expert but there's just sort of one of
them
and the other doctors are like not so
sure about that
i would say you should believe the rogue
doctor
[Music]
20 of the time at most
maybe 10 maybe 5 maybe 1
but if you think hey i watched a youtube
and there was an actual very qualified
person who had a persuasive argument
the amount of beliefs you should put on
that would be 20
if you're putting 100 on that you don't
understand how anything works
you can easily find a rogue doctor who
will be completely persuasive
and completely qualified for any
viewpoint you want
anything yeah so don't believe
the rogue doctor doesn't mean they're
wrong
definitely doesn't mean they're wrong
but you shouldn't put
credibility in it just because a doctor
said so
um all right
there's a rumor that dr fauci
once bought a ticket to ozzy osbourne
concert
which would in effect be funding the bat
human interface
but i guess i used that joke twice
um too credentialed to be considered a
rogue
nope that's that's the trap so in the
comments i'm seeing somebody say that
uh that this particular doctor i think
you're referring to
is too credentialed to be sort of a
quack
nope that's not a thing there's no such
thing
as being too credentialed to be a quack
not a thing the moment you think that
can't be a thing
you're really going to be confused about
the world it's
please exploit explain rogue versus
whistleblower
well a whistleblower would be somebody
who's just telling you what they saw
right i i saw or heard or experienced
this
the the rogue doctor is looking at data
and interpreting it different than other
doctors
they're not even close
um are we woke for covid
we're trying
um moderna and nih
patent uh rona delivery in december took
two days to create
well so there's some uh thought that it
that the coved vaccination
was too fast now of course it takes a
long time to test it
but remember the mrna platform
if i'm using the right technical terms
the
mrna platform was designed to be able to
quickly address a virus
so maybe it just worked exactly the way
they designed it
because apparently they can now they're
taking a look at everything from
age to malaria to herpes to dang fever
and they think they can
fairly rapidly spin up the
mrna platform to make a testable
vaccination for all of those
so that's interesting
all right uh how are my decoy titles
working quite well
quite well so we i finally figured out
that i was being demonetized immediately
based on the
titles in the broadcast because the
titles would often be
provocative concepts but the way i
talked about them was not violating any
rules
and i do that intentionally it is my
intention
to never violate a youtube term of
service
all right like i'm going to try my
legitimate best
to not violate any terms of service so
if i do it
i mean you know that that's that's going
to highlight a problem
because i feel as if some people maybe
do it intentionally
right don't you feel like some people
are seeing where they can
push the line and if they get banned
that's sort of a different situation
than somebody who's trying to follow the
rules
i'm trying to finally follow the rules
thanks trey all right and that's all i
got for now
and i will talk to you tomorrow
