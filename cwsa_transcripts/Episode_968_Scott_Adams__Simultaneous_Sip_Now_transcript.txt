um
hey everybody come on in here
it's time for well you know what time
for coffee with Scott Adams
printing out my notes here I'm a little
bit late yes I did a little thing called
sleeping in
don't like to do that a lot
yeah late again
overslept
so I know what you'd like to do probably
this morning you'd like probably like to
join in on the simultaneous Sip and all
it takes is a copper among your glass
attacker Challenger starting a canteen
Checker flask a vessel of any kind
filled with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now of the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamines the
other day the thing makes everything
better including the damn pandemic
damn pandemic yeah join me now go
so Periscope has this minor bug in it
that if you use a certain kind of
headset where you can talk and listen
you have to remember to hit a button
before you go live or else you can't
talk to people
so I had to redo it and that's all it
was
uh good morning good morning let me grab
my notes don't go anywhere
today the news
looks like uh it's all repeat news
let me do let me do the news for today
but I can also do the news for every day
for the next three weeks are you ready
here's the news every day for the next
three weeks
there are some doctors in Provo who are
doing a study on a new potential
coronavirus treatment called Provo fluff
they have signed up people but it's not
completely a good study because they
don't have a good control group
so we're waiting on that
Tuesday the news will be
there's some doctors and blah blah blah
they're testing some blah blah blah
they're getting some people blah blah
blah we hope it works blah blah blah
I don't believe any of the uh any of the
news about tests anymore do you
I really don't I just you know
everything that I see about this they
try this and they got to read good
results and it's not quite scientific
and you know it's only 80 people but it
looks good I've got a feeling that none
of it's real at this point just feels
like none of it's real
um
certainly by now if hydroxychloroquine
was a big deal
we'd know it by now right would you
agree would you all agree with this
statement that if hydroxychloroquine was
a magic pill
as opposed to just being a little bit
useful which I think is where it's going
to end up
we'd know it by now
the same with most of the drugs if if
any of the drugs they're testing were
really just knocking the crap out of
this virus we'd know it by now
um yeah let's talk about Obama gate you
know when Obama Gade first started
trending as a hashtag I didn't even know
exactly what it was but I guess it just
refers to the
the looking into the origins of the
Russia occlusion hoax and we know now
that
uh Barack Obama apparently at least knew
that the the wiretap on Flynn had
happened
but we don't know what else he knew what
else did he know hmm
so I was looking at the trending hashtag
and there was a tweet just a few minutes
ago there's a tweet where I showed the
hashtag at 2.6 million which if you
don't follow the hashtags that's a lot
because typically a trending hashtag
could have like 6 000 tweets or you know
sixty thousand if it's a really big one
that would be a really big hashtag sixty
thousand people retweeting it
Obama Gates had a 2.6 million
but here's what's interesting just
minutes after I had 2.6 million it had
2.1 million
I don't know if it's just the difference
between how they
how they count the hashtags at different
times might be a lag or something but uh
I don't know if it went down or up I saw
some other people complaining that it
went down but I'm not sure they saw it
correctly I'm not sure I saw it
correctly either
um so the weirdest thing happened last
night some of you had the same weird
experience and I want to see how many of
you experienced this the first part of
it you had to have joined me last night
when I was talking about for the second
time the the simulation
and so I did my little Periscope
entirely on the topic of the simulation
and had a how to reprogram your your
reality with stories
and I'm done with that and I'm kind of
winding down for the night and I turn on
Fox News and they were ending up a
special about Watergate I guess and I
guess there was some time left over in
which they'd stuck in and extended
I guess a paid must have been a paid
thing from Joel Osteen now typically
Joel would be in front of a church
packed full of people giving them his
inspirational message
but
because of the coronavirus it was an
empty church and he was just giving his
act here's the part that blew my mind
it's Joel Lusty
and uh
the way he decided to talk about the
coronavirus our current situation is
that God was updating his software
do you believe that and he used to use
the phrase repeatedly throughout his
presentation he talked about the
coronavirus being thought of as a reboot
and that God sometimes needs to update
the software
and that he's updating the software
that's what the coronavirus situation is
gives us all time to you know take a
pause and step back and that when we go
back we will effectively have rebooted
civilization
along with our understanding of our
place in it
it's exactly what I said like half an
hour before except I'd left out the the
Christianity part
now the beauty of the simulation is that
it works as an overlay on any religion
you can put it on reincarnation
works for that you can put it on the
Islam any religion you want still works
so the what were the odds that I would
give a whole you know 45 minutes of
presentation about
the universe being a simulation made of
software and turn on TV and find one of
the most famous
Christian preachers saying exactly the
same thing
now yeah I'm not promoting his view or
or him or anything like that I know a
lot of people like him he's he's he does
a good job of keeping people uh let's
say motivated and feeling good about
themselves and if he makes money from
that I'm okay with that I don't think
anything about that is
too sketchy
um at least anything I've heard so if
you know something I I haven't heard it
but that was just weird all right here's
an update on
what could be
my best prediction ever now I do think
that my prediction about Evolution made
22 years ago pretty darn good but I'm
never going to get attention for that
one because people are still yeah I
don't think people are really going to
change their mind about where things are
there so I'll never get I'll never get
credit for that prediction
for a variety of reasons but this one
the Harris being the vice presidential
pick and then being considered at the
top of the ticket
it's getting closer and closer so Joel
Pollock noted in his tweet that Politico
is speaking about Harris as the you know
the likely one so Politico is already
talking about her as
pretty much the one you know they don't
go right out and saying it but they talk
about the activity in the Democratic
party and who likes what and who's
talking about what and it's starting to
sound like the consensus is pretty solid
around uh around Harris right now
and they talk about Elizabeth Warren
being a strong second and I think to
myself
I don't see it
if the second employee's Place choice is
literally impossible in my view
let me let me tell you this if Elizabeth
Warren is picked for the vice
presidential spot
I don't know anything about anything
that would be
to me that would be that would just blow
my whole world apart because I would
just say I don't understand anything
I've watched for the past year if that
happens because what I watched
was Warren being basically a you know a
death sentence for the Democratic party
if they add her to the the ticket what
the heck would they they be thinking
unless they're playing for a draft pick
next year but I don't think it works
that way
so
when your second choice
is just ridiculous
doesn't that kind of tell you they've
settled on the First Choice already
because you would have a a little better
looking second choice right I mean
obviously Warren is super capable you
know I'm not I'm not talking about that
but in terms of her fit and whether she
could win and all that you know it's
just an obvious losing proposition
all right
yeah so if that comes in
that will be my finest prediction but
we'll see
um
the dumbest pundit do you have a uh does
anybody have a nomination for the
dumbest political pundit working today
I want to I want to see your opinions
now when you say dumbest or when I say
dumbest I don't mean that they lie the
most because you're you're probably
going to say oh you know that's Jim
Acosta he's the dumbest one that a lot
of people watching this would say that
but I don't have any evidence of that
you know there you have evidence that
you know he's uh let's say
a member of one side but you don't know
what he really thinks right because a
lot of a lot of people in the public say
ridiculous things
but you think to yourself well they
don't believe him
you know that's just their job your
abundant you say ridiculous things about
the other side you say your side is
Magic and and awesome
so you don't really know that they're
dumb you just know that they've taken
aside
but there is one pundit that I gotta say
no matter what he's talking all he
registers is stupid
do you know who it is
give me some of your guess about a
pundit who registers is actually just
stupid
not just disagreeing with you
all right I'll wait to see your answers
my nomination is Joe Lockhart
Joe Lockhart even looks like the dumbest
guy on TV doesn't he
all right now I'm gonna be laughing
because I'm looking at your choices now
who would say Rachel maddowell now you
could disagree with everything Rachel
maddows has but how in the world do you
say she's dumb
she's brilliant you can hate everything
she says but she's brilliant and there's
no question about that
yeah well you know you I'm seeing names
like saliza J Ruben stelter I don't
think any of them are dumb
not even a little bit
I don't think Don lemon's dumb
now they're the ones Chris Cuomo he's
not dumb they're all the ones that I
would put in the category of they're
just on the side
but you compare you compare the names
that you've just said
to Joe Lockhart
I think it's a different category so
here's so Joe Lockhart is writing today
in for cnn.com
uh he's wondering why no newspapers have
called for the removal of President
Trump
and you say to yourself what what are
you even talking about yeah that's right
Joe Lockhart's wondering why no
newspapers have called like the boards
of newspapers where they get together
and they say this is this is the opinion
of our newspaper because he notes that
when Nixon was in trouble for Watergate
that there were lots of newspapers that
called for Nixon's removal
and he's saying how come there's no
newspaper doing that for Trump because
after all
Trump was guilty of calling those
neo-nazis fine people in Charlottesville
and I'm just saying what
what are you kidding me first of all
that didn't happen does he really think
that happened it's the most debunked
hoax and all of it's literally it's
literally the most debunked hoax if you
count the number of clicks Steve Cortez
got over 6 million clicks on his
debunking video I've probably gotten I
don't know if you added up all of the
retweets I've gotten debunking that
several million you know breitbarts run
several stories you know Joel Pollock's
a number of stories debunking it how
many hits did that get so just tens of
millions probably of hits debunking this
thing and he writes for CNN
and of course they don't they don't fact
check them even on their own
it's a depending piece so they don't
fact Jack of uh
and he's wondering now at the same time
that he's wondering
why he's why uh
why president Trump is not being asked
to be removed from office
what's the biggest hashtag in the
country at the same time
the same time the biggest hashtag is
obamigate
literally accusing Obama of something
worse than Watergate
because Obama gate
is way worse than Watergate
it's not even close
Watergate was sort of an ordinary little
crime
that probably didn't have that big of a
difference in the end result of anything
Obama gate
was literally a coup attempt these
things are not even close these are
these are not in the same house they're
not the same zip code if you were ever
going to say something was worse than
than Watergate
Obama gate is a thousand times worse and
while that's happening
right now exactly right now not even in
the same month but the same day that's
happening
Joe Locke our this call is saying that
President Trump should be removed from
office and that when he's puzzled the
newspapers aren't calling for it are you
kidding me today of all days this would
be the day the newspapers would call for
Trump to be removed after he's been
basically cleared of all Russia
collusion stuff that's when you want to
remove him from office after he's been
cleared of all charges and you know that
the other side was running a coup
this is the craziest dumbest thing I've
ever seen in my life it's I don't even
know how to react to it it's almost just
entertaining
I mean that's what it feels like all
right does anybody have any questions
they want to ask me I did oversleep a
little bit today and the news is boring
today it's all just repeat news
so repeat news
uh what if I told you people who don't
agree with your view evidence or not
will avoid your content
people who don't agree me with me will
avoid my content well that's how it
works
yeah I know somebody's mentioning Don
Lemon a lot as being the dumbest
uh pundit
um first of all I would call him a host
not a pundit but
I don't I have no reason to believe that
Don Lemon is dumb I what we see is
you know taking a team side but we don't
see dumbness
I mean he's pretty high level jobs that
he does well I doubt he's dumb
uh
Eiger how do you say senk's last name
Iger
I don't think he's dumb either
I don't see anything that would suggest
that any of these people are dumb
or Mika
Mika's not dumb are you kidding me
um did you see her her interview with
Biden was
was very sharp I thought
um
okay well enough of that does anybody
have any questions that they you would
like to ask me because I feel as if the
the news is hitting sort of a rut
it just just feels like the news is
going to be the same every day for a
while uh we shouldn't have opened up
look at the number of deaths and it's
worse than the flu here's our death
count I just feel like it's gonna be the
same thing for a while all right
all right let's see who we've got
questions from
I think flip
flip let's see if you have a question
flip do you have a question for me
people who think in binaries uh because
it's it's either all or nothing it's we
want Grandma to die or I mean I and I I
feel like you can't even have a
conversation with the average person
because it's so polarized yeah well I do
find that just pointing out what you
just pointed out usually works in person
so if you're actually having a real
conversation with somebody who's
thinking in a binary the The High Ground
maneuver as I call it is to take the
adult position because if you say to
them well you know it's not either
either or it could be somewhere in
between could be a little little bit of
this most people will agree with you
that it's somewhere in between they will
immediately go to the adult position
because it's embarrassing to stay at the
kids table when you've already moved to
the adult table and said something as
adult as well you know it's not as clean
as this or that you know there's there's
a lot of gray area in the middle almost
everybody in person will come with you
but if you're talking on Twitter you
don't have the back and forth forth and
so they could just sort of keep their
weird position because it's Twitter so I
wouldn't even bother on Twitter but but
in real life in real life you just
pointed out they'll come with you
because nobody stays at the Kids Table
when you're sitting right next to them
at the adult table talking like an adult
they just have to they just have to join
you or else they just feel like the
child in the conversation it works every
time so thanks for the question hey
thank you
rarely do I have advice that is that
clean and
and useful
all right
I don't know if this is a name or a
label or even if this will work because
it looks like we're not connecting all
right looks like that didn't work
let's try someone else
I think people uh get stage fright when
I select them
let's take Cassandra
Cassandra
Cassandra are you there
hi do you have a do you have a question
for me Cassandra
it's so long since we talked um I was
wondering you
can use in your job and stuff like that
and I'm wondering are you going digital
is there other ways that you know that
we can promote you and you know build us
better oh you're the best
um yeah yeah so the background on that
is I've I've gotten the cats on the roof
um
a letter from my syndication company
cats on the roof is reference to warning
that there's you know big trouble ahead
at the moment the cat's on the roof but
it's not looking good so
um yeah so by the end of the year I
would not be surprised if I'm not a
cartoonist anymore uh because there just
won't be newspapers and there may not be
enough advertising that even the online
stuff works so
of course I'm not going to be the guy
who's complaining because you know we
live in a world where
um I'm still I'm still in better shape
than just about everybody so I'm not
going to about it I'm just going
to tell you what it is because I think I
think it's good that we all know what
everybody's situation is that's rather
than complaining about it
will any of those pick you up or uh I'm
sorry what like mag is magazines or any
of those will they pick you up well no
because magazines are all going out of
business too they're not really big
customers so here's here's what I'll
what I'm doing I'm moving to a
non-advertising based model so some of
my some of my material will be on locals
locals.com so I've already moved
this that's a subscriber site so you can
see everything that you can see here
will also be there conveniently but it
has a bunch of features that you you
won't have here it's a material that you
all have here so I'll be putting special
micro lessons there things that you
won't get at anywhere else so the people
who find the most value
can simply pay a small amount
subscription and they can get it and
those who don't care we'll go watch
something else so I'm kind of drawn to
the subscription uh process partly
because it's optional you know nobody
has to do it and partly because I'm more
comfortable in a situation where
somebody says oh I got a value so I'll
give you some some money that's equal to
that value I'm always most comfortable
there the whole ever the whole
advertising thing feels like uh I'm
giving somebody something for free but
then they're penalized by watching a
commercial they didn't want to watch
it's just it's not ideal I like you know
here's a dollar here's a dollar's worth
of value we both win everybody goes home
so I have a great host of that and so
far the subscription service so you can
find it at locals with an s on it
locals.com
um and just search for my name so far
it's working well people are signing up
I didn't know how that would go but it's
going great so anybody anybody who wants
to support me going forward that would
be my preferred way to do it because
that way you get something for your
money yeah the the patreon stuff
I tried it it just doesn't feel right I
don't like people donating money I'd
rather that this is a subscription to
get something out of it but thank you
for the question yeah it's pretty cool
thank you all right take care bye
foreign
let's see what
uh
see what Joe has to say
Joe come to us let the technology work
Joe's technology was not working
let's try
Lowell
I still don't know why some people don't
connect when I try to connect them I
don't know if they're quitting or not
this one looks
Joel can you hear me
hi do you have a question for me Joel I
I do not my name is Lowell but I I just
wanted to tell you
why did you change your name to Lowell
yeah go ahead
well I just wanted to tell you Scott
that you're amazing man I I listen to
you every day and you're changing my
freaking life and I don't know I just
want to tell you I love you man
well I appreciate that tell me it would
help me to tell me what would be could
you point something out in particular
that changed the way you think is that
is that what's happening
yeah any particular concept that you
thought was especially powerful
I guess it's kind of hard to put
together since you're asking me but I've
read your books man it's been like a
it's been a journey the last couple of
years I've been following you and I just
feel like my life has gotten so much
better like guys
good you know how old are you
I'm 37. 37. yeah my the the stuff I do
seems to work for every age but the the
younger you are the more people find
that you know they have more years to to
practice what they've learned so they
get a little more value on it good well
I'm so glad for the call and thank you
thanks thanks for taking my call man all
right take care
Lionel are you on there Lionel
uh hello
yes
Coronavirus
excuse me and now they see you
well yeah
or do you think yeah
I think mostly revert back to normal
um anytime there's any kind of a shock
to the country people go out and buy
guns but I think it's mostly the people
who already have guns
I feel like people were just getting
extra guns I I doubt there were too many
Democrats who were anti-gun who said to
themselves you know this is going to put
me over the edge now now I'm going to
get a gun there had to be some
but I doubt that so they kind of
long-term shift to that that sort of
stuff so uh probably we'll just go back
to normal I have to I have to admit I I
always have that same
um same reaction too it's like any
trouble I better get to the gun store
but I'm in California so buying a gun is
such a pain in the ass that you know I
think twice
all right um yeah the question was about
what other people would buy more guns
because the coronavirus stuff they
already have but I don't think it'll be
a major change in society after that
the audience couldn't hear you Lyle so
I'm going to disconnect but thank you
for the call
all right let's see where is I was
looking for somebody in particular I
just saw sign on but
I guess we'll go with Norman
Norman
Norman are you there do you have a
question
I did enjoy your interface for reality
what was the interface for life
um I'm still thinking about it
um I hoping it's a lot more than just
you know the power of positive thinking
which you know sometimes can be hard to
force yourself to do yeah
I also enjoyed your uh I actually
subscribed to locals just to hear your
thoughts on microfinance
and uh you know I'm Gonna Keep some of
those in mind I'm a lot older than uh
Lowell and I did have a question I
thought the most important question you
could ask regarding uh
uh pundits that are not that sharp is um
whose predictions have been proven wrong
the most well you know on the left that
it's almost a it's like a million way
tie isn't it because I think the people
on the left if you subtract Michael
Moore who was close to being right about
Trump once you subtract him is there
even one person you would say on the
left who had anything like a good track
record who would you suggest as even in
the running for that after Michael Moore
it's unbelievable how wrong we've been
over and over and over and over again
now when you say we do you mean do you
consider yourself part of the the left I
I that's not what I I am part of the
left I am but but when I say we I mean
everybody because I don't think anybody
got it right
well I will well well nobody well except
for you okay
foreign
maybe we'll see if I get the uh if I get
the Kamala Harris prediction right will
you admit that it wasn't a Black Swan
in other words you're I know I don't
mean it was a black one I said you're a
black one oh I have a Black Swan okay
you're like sort of consistently kind of
that's why people find you so fast hey
this is why Nevada finds you so
fascinating because you look at things
from a different way and it actually
works
you know I was uh thinking about this
when uh I was learning to play drums and
I've been this will make sense in a
minute I was watching some Dave Grohl uh
of course famous musician plays lots of
instruments and he was talking about
learning drums and and also the the
drummer that he hired was talking about
it and I'm amazed at how many
professional musicians learn to play
their instrument without taking a lesson
now some of it is they just have some
natural talent but I think that some of
the magic when people say how come
nobody drums the way Dave Grohl does
considered by many of the best rock
drummer of all time and you see him do
it he just doesn't do it the same way as
other people and that like likewise
other great drummers they simply don't
do it the same way they've got their own
thing and I think a lot of that has to
do with not taking lessons and not going
through grips on the guitar playing it
like left-handed and upside down yeah I
mean just the people who are self-taught
they end up looking like more of a
better product if it works out now in my
case I'm a terrible artist who tried to
become a cartoonist now because I didn't
go through art school and I was just
sort of working down on my own and
trying to figure out what kind of marker
pens worked on the paper and I mean just
all of it I just had to work out on my
own and I think that there's
there's something to that that makes it
look special when you're done because
you can see it came out of a one
person's mind and when you're looking at
art you can tell the difference between
the committee art and a one-person
creation and it's really it's striking I
mean you would you would know if a
committee painted a painting you know
you just say ah all the parts look good
but I don't know it doesn't hold
together for some reason it doesn't
doesn't touch me but then you see
something made by one crazy you know uh
Van Gogh or something you go whoa
whoever made that that's that's an art
there I don't even know how you would
make that if you tried to copy it and so
I wondered that about
um how I got here
not going through any normal paths to be
person talking about politics there's
some benefits to working it out yourself
and it makes you an original when you
get there because you didn't learn it
right so there's something about not
learning it right that I find very
appealing and it works for me but maybe
not for everybody all right in fact if
you can persist in your Folly you'll be
a genius kind of a thing yeah you know
I'll give you the simple version of this
I wrote about once the best way to be a
creative person is to try to copy
somebody else you like in that field but
do a bad job of it because other people
won't recognize who you copied because
you're not very good at it and that's
exactly what I did so I tried to copy uh
Gary Larson's art and I tried to copy uh
some art from you know Mad Magazine and
some other people and I would try to do
it the way they did it as as best I
could but if I would draw a character
trying to make it the way Gary Larson
would draw it it wouldn't come out right
and it would look like my own character
but it was still okay because it looked
original so doing a bad job at copying
other artists
makes you look creative so uh that's the
easy way to get there all right thanks
for the question thank you
all right let's try
Kim
see if Kim has a question for me
Kim do you have a question for me
all right
is your current thought about whether
the virus was released from the Wuhan
lab versus not
well would you say released uh it was I
mean I've seen um possible possibilities
there was an you know it was an
accidental release
um yeah I don't think there's any
there's no chance in my mind there's no
chance anybody did it intentionally is
that the question uh no I was actually
wondering if you've delved into whether
it was naturally occurring it came from
the wet Market process
uh well you know that's in the category
of things we'll never know for sure but
if I had to if I had to bet on it I'd
put a
I'd say 80 chance it came from the lab
20 chance it came from all other means
put together so 80 chance that's what it
feels like to me but you know we're all
just flying in the dark here I'm just
saying that if there's such an obvious
way it could have come from a lab and we
know it was there and we don't know that
there was ever anything like that in the
wet Market because they didn't have bats
it's leaning that way so 80 chance that
sounds fair
I'm with you on that all right well you
have time for one more quickie okay okay
um I'm the unusual animal of being a
conservative who loves Elon Musk and
I've noticed that he has now become you
know red pilled let's say about
um governmental Fascism and I wonder if
he would um you know disrupt the next
industry to disrupt would be the news
using satellites his satellites that
he's lost
um I've never I've never seen any
indication that Elon was sort of
interested in the the news business it
doesn't that's true he has um called for
something called Pravda which is
um a website that would check uh the
truth uh yes he has he has ventured
towards that but but that's more of a
fact checking on the news as opposed to
recapping the news yeah I don't know if
he has an interest in that but it does
seem to me that you can't you can't be a
proper billionaire without controlling
some part of the news
I think Jeff Bezos and also Carlos Sims
with the New York Times they've sort of
set the standard that if you're going to
be this rich
it'd be nice to have your own news
organization exactly and fox has lost
its way so I think we have there's an
opening there well as as Fox lost its
way or uh are they trying to show a
little bit more uh diversity of opinion
I don't know because it because you can
see both right it's not like any
nobody's telling Hannity what to say
nobody's telling Tucker what to say I
mean so so you can't say fox lost his
way if their biggest talent is doing
whatever the hell they want just like
always I I mean I do think you know I'm
not there but my my opinion from the
outside is that guys like uh Tucker and
Hannity Laura Ingram you know the big
opinion voices I don't think anybody's
telling them what to say I don't think
their bosses are telling them maybe but
I'd be surprised on the big stuff anyway
right okay so yeah the fact that you see
more
you know more diversity of opinion on
Fox I'm not sure that's bad you know I
can see why some of the audience will
say ah get that out of there but you
know think about the biggest problem of
CNN viewers is they literally don't hear
the news imagine consuming what you
think is news all day and then you
didn't get any because the the left just
doesn't show right on the right and
they've lost its way I don't think that
I think they do present the other side
better than CNN ever tried to so there
is that but and that's what I'm looking
for you know something that would be in
the middle in this way yeah I saw
there's a uh really good app that I'm
going to point you to I was going to
mention this as if I can quickly find it
was a ground something maybe somebody
could remind me before I but I'll find
it quite quickly because I know exactly
where I'm looking and the app is called
this is from Jeff Pilkington he noticed
this it's called the uh the ground owned
news
so ground let the ground you're standing
on news it's an app and it it takes all
the different news sites and puts them
in their left right
issues and finds out where they have
blind spots and stuff so it sounds like
the the idea that Elon was going for
sort of a way to know who's giving it to
you straight in comparison to all the
others it feels like there's an app
that's trying to do that I haven't
looked at it closely but uh Jeff has
Jeff Pilkington and he was impressed by
it so give it a look good I've sent a
lot of people your way and shout out to
Tom Tennant
all right thank you
thank you all right
somebody I'm looking for here
if I can find him he's asked to join
damn it oh he keeps disappearing
all right let's try Andres
um
Andres are you there
Andres are you there
hello
ah hi
do you have a question for me uh yes
basically in the country where I live we
have also now people who hallucinate
that
um the government of power basically on
the lockdown comes close to the Nazi
power grab in 1933.
and um
well apparently they are seeing an
elephant in the room that the rest of
the people are not seeing I'm just
wondering what's a good what's a good
way to convince somebody they're
hallucinating something
well uh convincing somebody that they're
hallucinating is almost impossible
because they they're seeing it with
their own eyes they feel it that you
can't talk somebody out of it but here's
here's the best thing you could do you
the best thing you could do is get them
to arrive at it through questions so
rather than say you're wrong you're
seeing it wrong and people just Harden
in their in their opinion you could say
something like this really it looks like
you think that the German situation is
like the beginning of maybe some kind of
a Nazi lockdown and they say yeah yeah
then you say how different are things in
Germany compared to all the other
countries who are dealing with the same
thing are they treating it differently
and then your friend says well I don't
know I haven't looked at other countries
you say well it seems to me if you did
they were they're all doing the same
thing seems like every country is going
through exactly the same thing I'm
wondering why only in Germany it looks
like the beginning of a Nazi takeover
but in every other country such as is
you know you name it it's not but you
also realize that every country is
having the same conversation right so I
would broaden it away from Germany so
that they could see that your situation
is essentially identical to most of the
other industrialized countries and just
say if it's happening everywhere
I don't know is the whole country going
Nazi I don't think so or the whole whole
uh the whole world probably not so
that's the best you could do is just
point out that it's everywhere so you
shouldn't worry about it specifically
that's that's not going to talk anybody
out of it but it might make him pause a
little bit because that's the sort of
thing they have to talk themselves on it
so you just want to ask the questions
let them deal with the new the new
expansion of their thinking maybe they
go away and come back better but mostly
you're not going to be able to change
Minds on that stuff you know only only
uh events themselves could change it
which means we get past this and things
go back to normal
um but thanks for the question before
you go
um
to correct me if I'm wrong but I got
disconnected from following you and then
then I re-followed you does that sound
know what I what I meant basically
following back you never followed me
before so no glitch I never I never
followed you before
okay I've interacted with you so many
times I thought I had so I'm following
you now but thank you you're one of my
best uh favorite
um Twitter
personalities because one of the great
things about being in my position if
you've got you know I'm closing in on
half a million uh followers is that it
attracts some people who are just
unusually good at commenting on stuff
and and you're one of them you're in my
my top two or three I think and so it
makes what I do so much more valuable
because I'll say something crazy than
people who actually know how to analyze
things sort of know how to look at the
world they come in in the comments and
say yes or no or should have thought of
this and then I start with these bad
ideas and then the commenters such as
yourself you're definitely one of the
best uh just carve it down into
something real and it's kind of a
wonderful honestly so thank you for that
thanks a lot bye all right take care yes
it's a weird interface
all right uh it looks like the interface
let's see
there we go
we've got some unusual things happening
here on my screen let's try
Julie
Julie Julie Julie will our technology
work Julie can you hear me do you have a
question
I can go ahead I I was wondering what
your take is the University's opening in
the fall you were pretty early on saying
watch what the other universities are
doing and when they closed early you
said the other universities would and
they did so I have two 20 year olds who
are eager to leave my house and get back
to their lives at school where are their
schools
they are 20 years old or almost 20 and
they go to the University of Connecticut
yeah I think there'll be probably a
pretty big difference in terms of when
things open based on the school and what
resources they have and and all that but
I do think that whatever is going to be
the same thing if some of them reopen
most of them will
um and I don't know if they're going to
wait to see if the experience is bad at
the other ones I doubt it I think
they're just going to have to and a pure
desperation and self-defense I think
they're going to have to open because
the biggest risk to colleges is that
people find out they can do without them
for a year
one of the things that Naval said uh
recently is if we go a year let's say
this next coming year becomes more
remote learning let's say the students
don't go to school they stay home but
they do a year of school with uh remote
learning and what what are they going to
pay for that are they going to pay the
same as they would if they were there in
person you know not counting the room
and board part and and uh what happens
at the end if they get just as good at
education
but they did it remotely how is the
college going to justify charging the
same amount next year exactly exactly
because especially with engineering you
really need the lab work you need to be
being on it you can't just learn through
the computer very well although I think
that's just because we're not good at it
yet I would argue that we will reach a
point where learning it on the computer
will be so much better I mean you'll
you'll be able to have a you know a 3D
View and you'll be on your computer and
when you're doing engineering you'll
actually be able to reach out and touch
objects that don't exist and put them
together so you know once you're
actually manipulating a virtual space
with virtual objects then the online
stuff will be way better than in person
but not yet all right thanks thank you
thank you
foreign
yeah college is going to be just a mess
I'm so glad I'm not happy to deal with
that
all right Joe it looks like you came
back
Joe Joe
Hey Joe
Jim do you have a question for me Joe
Scott yes do you have a question yes um
um I really enjoy your show it's uh I I
really value what you do but I have to
know with what this ongoing coup is
someone gonna get per blocked I I gotta
see somebody high level punished
well the problem is that the people at
the high level are smart enough to not
leave any uh let's say you know bloody
gloves at the scene so what I would
expect is that it's going to come down
to something like well I knew the
president wanted me to do this but he
didn't say it or he didn't say it but it
was obvious that this would be a good
thing and he'd like it or uh Clapper
didn't directly tell us to do this but
we interpreted this as part of our job
so you could get this this weird
um you know not direct evidence of the
assuming that there was any kind of a
ringleader or ring leaders I don't think
there's going to be direct evidence for
them to be involved I think it will be
at most a verbal conversation that could
be interpreted two ways so I don't I
don't think you're going to see anybody
at a at a bread and Clapper or Obama
level doing a purple one I don't think
that's oh no no I I get that but maybe
Comey he he seems like a natural Fall
Guy from a simulation perspective he
does he does Kobe seems like what I mean
it feels like if you wrote this as a
movie Kobe would be going down I I feel
the same way and I don't know exactly
why that was the point I wanted to make
I see his name even sounds like Kami you
know it's perfect
yeah call me that was funny
um yeah there's there's something
um
there's something about Comey that makes
them seem like the natural I'd bet
against it though because you know
everything that Comey has done uh
indicates that he's smart enough to know
how the system works I mean he doesn't
yeah so Kobe is another one you you
could say whatever you want to say about
him if you like him or don't like him
but you can't say he's not smart right I
mean he's a bit smart with air covering
smart without air cover too you know
what I mean yeah well okay if the bosses
love you you know you don't have to be
that smart that's true that's true but
yeah yeah go ahead I I just love what
you've been talking about lately in
terms of the simulation and stuff I
found it in my own life you've been
you've been really insightful you've
validated a lot of things I've said I
knew president Trump would win the
moment I saw him come down those stairs
everybody thought I was insane I never
relented once I said have you seen
Hillary Clinton have you seen this guy I
was even a fan because you know
I'm just saying you know are your
 detector that that that that
really resonated and your Island stuff
you know the prisoner Island I was on
prisoner Island I know what you're
talking about uh okay good well thanks
God glad that resonates thanks Joe
all right
let's take one more we'll do one more
can't we
who really really wants to talk to me
badly I don't know if anybody does but
we'll find out all right Leanne are you
connected
hi what's your question LAN
it's about the convict Island thing you
brought up on last night's Periscope
okay yeah and I
I say that I thought to myself I think I
have one of those stories real or not
right but I'm just
it's a little off and I'm not sure if um
I should be using it as a story so I
wanted to tell you yes you can do it but
you have to make it the quick version
because okay yes absolutely um mines
always involves a plane crash I'm all
always in it whether I'm actually on a
plane or just thinking about it walking
around and I'm always I always survive
no matter the scenario where I go into a
side of a mountain or into the water
even when the plane's going down I'm
helping people like and I'm thinking
it's okay because I know I'm going to
survive this I'll always survive no
matter the scenario well that that is a
that is a really uh healthy and
productive view unless it keeps you
unless it makes you do dangerous things
you don't do dangerous extreme sports do
you no not at all no yeah I like that
because that sounds like just a a really
healthy mindset it's not really going to
impinge on your real world you know
because you know it probably won't
change anything you do in the real world
but it'll keep you with that positive
mindset I like it now the only
Improvement I would offer on that yeah
to the extent that you could come up
with news stories is one that had more
about your own efforts being what keeps
you safe
so right now
MacGyver type things in my head you know
that I how I get off the side of the
mountain you know
little shorts and a t-shirt or something
right
is that the kind you mean or yeah yeah
so so if you keep your little uh
imaginary story where you're the hero
through your own good work and let's say
your good work is something you could
actually do you know something humanly
you could do it might be a stretch but
it's humanly possible uh and I I like
where you're going with that okay I'll
I'll keep uh rewriting the story a
little bit thank you thank you so for
those of you who uh didn't get the
context there
last night I was talking about having
stories of your life and just briefly
one of my stories that's not a real
story but one that I keep as like an
operating system for the rest of my
software in my head it's it's the thing
that keeps me
um tuned to winning if you will my story
is that imagine I'm dropped onto the
island of convicts it's only prisoners
on this island and I'm dropped off from
the helicopter and on day one they beat
me up day two they Bibi up day three
they beat me up day seven they beat me
up I'm just like you know abused and
turned into like a human human whatever
but if you come back in a year
I'm in charge of the island and I've
killed everybody who touched me
so that's the story that I keep because
you could beat me up for a week or two
or a month but when I'm done
if I ever get a little bit of traction
if you ever turn your back if I get the
slightest Advantage I'm going to run
your damn Island and I'm going to kill
every one of you and you can bet on it
so that's that's the software I keep in
my head that I apply to every situation
because you come into situations and day
one is often not so good and day two is
often not so good too in three weeks in
it's not so good but I'm gonna run the
island
so it doesn't matter what the actual
situation is I tell myself yeah getting
beat up the first week that's just part
of the job I'm gonna run this island
so it doesn't have to be true
it just has to be a story you run in
your head that you you let influence
your general demeanor so it's how you
program your personalities with stories
because we're story creatures
all right um so that's why you missed
um
never doubt the power of coconut and
coconut pies well I don't know what that
means but I've never doubted I guess
that's the island
uh may we know your Island to take over
a plan
roughly speaking yes yes I'll tell you I
would be able to influence people
one at a time
to think that working with me was better
than not so I would convince people one
at a time that being on my side was
their best play until I had enough of
them and then I'd run the island but
it'd be one one-on-one thing you'd have
to convince them individually
all right that is all
um
Ben says in the comments I'm Scott's
prison lover in my dream well you need
to upgrade your uh your movie story
that's the worst possible one that was
pretty funny though all right that's all
I got for now I'll talk to you tonight
you know where
