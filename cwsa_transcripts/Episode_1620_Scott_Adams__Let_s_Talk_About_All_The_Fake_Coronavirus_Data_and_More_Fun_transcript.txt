good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that ever happened to you
not only that but the best thing that
ever happened to anybody
now you might say to yourself scott do
you have any data
to support your claim that this is the
best thing that has ever happened to
anybody everywhere
well as a matter of fact i do and the
quality of my data it's as good as your
covet hospitalization numbers may be
better
and so you can depend on it and if you
go if you'd like to depend on something
else there is something called the
simultaneous sip that isn't your future
and all you need to participate is a
cover mugger glass a tanker chalices
dying they can't eat and jugger flask of
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that's
better than everything it's called the
simultaneous sip and watch it happen now
go
sublime
well
here's your uh persuasion lesson for the
day are you ready i'm gonna give you the
easiest quickest persuasion lesson that
will work in your personal lives
this one's a good one
i've used it when i talk about russia
and the united states but i'm gonna
tell you the trick
and then you can use it in your own life
you may be aware that i've said that we
should go ahead and just propose that we
have an alliance with russia
as allies
instead of being enemies
the reasoning being
what's the good reason for being an
enemy
there's none same with north korea give
me one good reason that we should be
enemies with the country on the other
side of the world
none there's just not one good reason
except we keep poking each other for no
reason
except that i guess the other is poking
us first
so what i say about that situation is
eventually we know we're going to be
allies because we have to when
when we become more of a space faring
world which is probably 20 years maximum
in space we're going to need to ally
with russia
because otherwise china runs the whole
world
and so given that it's inevitable
and that life is short
why not do it now
so that's the technique
it's inevitable
and we both know it
life is short
let's just do it now
now imagine that technique when you're
arguing with your spouse
about something unimportant
has anybody ever had an argument with a
spouse or a loved one
about something that
wasn't very important
anybody anybody
[Laughter]
like all of you all the time right
so here's the trick
once you've exhausted the topic but you
don't know how to end it you ever get in
those situations you say your thing the
other person says their thing and then
you just keep repeating yourselves in
different ways
here's the way to get out of it because
both of you are looking for a way out
you just don't have an exit ramp
here's the exit ramp
you know
we're gonna get over this just like we
get over everything else
we're gonna get over this just like
everything else
life is short
let's just go ahead and get there
because everything in between is a waste
of our life
because we know we're going to go there
we know we're going to stay married we
know we're going to stay together we
know this isn't a big problem
life is short
life is short
you're not going to be worrying about
this on your deathbed
by the way i added in a second technique
there
the death bed reframe
one of the best ones
if you're if you're arguing about
something unimportant and you know most
the time you are it's usually
unimportant
just do the death bed reframe let me ask
you this
do you think you're going to be thinking
about this on your deathbed
oh i wish i had taken that argument a
bit a little bit further
no
you're not you're not going to think of
it on your deathbed we're definitely
going to get over it
life is short
let's do it
now now i've never seen that work
instantly
that's my caution i've never seen
anybody say yeah you know you're right
it doesn't work that way
but you can take something that might
have lasted you another hour
and maybe you know compress it to 15
minutes
if you just stay on that message and say
you know we could argue about it all day
but the fact is we're just going to both
get over it and by tomorrow we'll
probably be back to normal let's just do
it now
enjoy the evening life is short
there's your tip
for the day
let me ask you this
five years ago if you saw that the
country was disagreeing and
arguing about stuff and couldn't decide
who was right and who was wrong about
whatever doesn't matter what the topic
is
how often would somebody say
that the problem was that part of the
public or all of it had been hypnotized
or was part of a mass formation
psychosis
same thing
how often would you hear that phrasing
we've been that the the public had been
hypnotized
almost never almost never
where did it start
where did you start hearing hey i think
everybody's being hypnotized
that started with me
i'm pretty sure
i'm not the only person who said it you
know
mike cernovich and and other people who
are trained in
this sort of field you know persuasion
probably have talked about this sort of
thing before but what's different is
it's not just the weirdos talking about
it
it's now mainstream thought
think about this
think about the fact that five years ago
we would have said
if we disagreed we would have believed
that the reason we disagreed was that
somebody stupid the other person
not you
no not you not not me
i'm talking about when we disagree with
other people
we assume the other people are stupid
because the alternative is that well we
don't want to think about the
alternative
so in the old days you think okay the
other person is dumb or they don't have
enough data
or they're lying just you know for
self-interest just to be a democrat or a
republican right
so your mental model was somebody was
lying wrong or just selfishly you know
doing a team thing
today when people disagree what do we
say
we say people are brainwashed hypnotized
or in a mass formation psychosis
that pretty much was me
i think
i i think i'm the one who changed that
frame
little at a time just chipping away at
it you know mostly talking about trump
but
i feel like
i feel like my point of view is now
mainstream
thinking
now
it's not because something changed just
because the way we looked at it changed
am i crazy
give me a sanity check this isn't even a
fact check this is literally a sanity
check by the way this is
absolutely
um i'm giving i'm saying something
straight with no hyperbole
i'm asking for a sanity check
like really
like really really i'm not kidding
because
right so somebody says diluted that's
what i'm looking for
deluded
or uh accurate or partially accurate
what would you say
um
well you're not really committing to
this are you no i i get that you know
there's an ego element of this right so
that's that's stipulated
so i'm seeing people on locals who have
watched me the longest say accurate and
some people saying accurate
yeah
i i think that i'm the primary thing
that changed this
i actually do
and
it's because when you see a better frame
you can't really resist it
if a better frame is actually better
people recognize it that's what makes
frames so um
that's what makes a frame so powerful
that the moment you're exposed to it you
say yeah that's a pretty good way to
look at it
it's that immediate attractiveness of a
better frame
that does it somebody's saying that joe
rogan would be the primary
person for that but i feel like
i feel like this was happening before
the mass formation
psychosis thing that that definitely you
write that he would be the bigger
spreader of it
um carpe says that i i did have that
effect on him in terms of changing how
he sees things now how many times have
you seen the two movies on one screen
analogy
how many times have you heard somebody
talk about 3d chess or 4d chess
i think these are all for me right i
didn't make up the 3d chess thing but i
popularized it
yeah about when i was talking about
trump
anyway so there's no way to know if i
had a little bit of influence
or not
but
thank you for the fact check so i think
it's interesting that you can't tell
either right
so i guess the only thing that would
allow me to
claim sanity in this situation because
remember even if i were to look at my
own actions
as an outsider
i would question my sanity right now
would you
it's a reasonable question
because i'm making a claim that's almost
insanely ridiculous
so asking the question and seeing that
some of you agree with my insanely
ridiculous viewpoint
tells me i might be wrong but maybe not
crazy
would you give me that
would you give me that i could easily be
wrong
easily
but i'm not crazy because a lot of you
are thinking that it sounds reasonable
next topic
did you know that hypnosis is suppressed
on the internet
do a little uh
here's a little uh experiment
use
voice texting
and then try to get your voice to text
to correctly write the word hypnosis
it won't spell it right
and by the way there's no word that
sounds like hypnosis
your spell check will spell it h-i-p
and did you know that if you tried to
search for hypnosis on the internet you
get a lot of hits
but did you know the good stuff is
hidden it won't show up in search
i can't tell you where to find it for
the same reason
there there is a form of hypnosis that's
so powerful
that the search engines won't let you
find it
you have to know where it is and know
what to look for
and and it's so powerful that i won't
tell you what it is either
there there's a level of
hypnosis power that you do not want to
be exposed to
believe me it's dangerous stuff and the
the internet just hides it from you
now i've i've
i know this because i've searched many
times to see if i can make the the
search engine comply you can't
you can't it really hides the good stuff
so there's a whole world that's not
available to you and i can't tell you
about it either
rasmussen has a poll
if trump ran against biden today trump
would win easily with 46 percent
compared to biden's 40 i'm going to
claim victory on one of my predictions
which was
the longer trump is out of office the
better he will look
do you remember that prediction
the longer he's out of office the better
he will look because we would be removed
from the you know the fight
to just see what his policies were
what do you do
well he did improve the border security
blah blah
so sure enough the public has uh taken
that position but you want to hear the
most amazing thing
trump and biden would get roughly the
same amount of hispanic vote
just just try to hold that in your mind
for a moment
that it's close um
so biden would get 38 of the vote if he
ran against
38 of the hispanic
american vote
uh compared to
trump um
i'm sorry
38
38 would go to trump versus 41 to biden
so almost a statistical tie
let me tell you something about the
hispanic population at least in
california
so from my my personal experience
there is no group
that i know of
that complains less about
can anybody back me up on that
if you were to to find one identifiable
demographic group that just doesn't
complain about
it would be the hispanic americans and
and the hispanics who are not yet
americans
they are the most awesome group of
people if you have not experienced
the work ethic
and the attitude
and and the lack of complaining about
just the smallest that we spend
all our time on
it's a very impressive group of people
and i i would bet that almost 100 of
people have experience
with that demographic group would agree
with me it's it's just so true it just
it's across the whole
yeah of the people who came here to work
i'm not talking about any criminal
elements or anything but the people who
came here to work
it's just very true
um
and i think some of that attitude
translates into this result
that even though the news is saying oh
trump is your your racist enemy
i think the hispanic americans just said
what because he's trying to secure the
border
i think i'll go to work
right
i feel i feel like the hispanics just
didn't get involved in the politics
they just heard oh trump's your enemy
he's terrible and they they think
because he wanted to secure the border
of his own country
i mean i'm glad i got here
but
why do we hate a president for securing
a border
like even if you if you even if you were
a beneficiary
of getting across the border illegally
you would still be reasonable and say
well
you can't let everybody cross the border
illegally i'm glad i got across
but you can't let everybody across
obviously
so
i just love this result because it says
that the at least the hispanic americans
are
relatively free from the
the brainwashing
relatively free from the hypnosis
because it looks like their point of
view is just like well
you know let's just judge them as
leaders and not get caught up in the
little stuff
u.s support for nuclear power
listen to this
between 2018 which wasn't that long ago
remember 2018 was the
middle of the trump administration
from 2018 to 2021
support for nuclear power in the united
states went from
49
so underwater less than half
to 59
in only three years
let me say that again
support for nuclear power in this
country in just three years
went from 49 to 59 a solid majority
from underwater
to solid majority
you want to hear more
support among democrats in particular
in 2018
only 37 percent
supported nuclear power in 2018 only 37
three years later
that 37 percent went to
wait for it
wait for it
sixty percent
what
what
has that ever happened before
have you ever seen any issue that's a
let's say a mature issue because we've
been talking about nuclear power forever
have you ever seen
support among one pat one side
go from 37 to 60
in three years
name one other thing that ever had that
happened
unless there was some big event right
there's no well i guess you could say
there's an event
there's some power shortages that's a
pretty big event
yeah i guess that would be the event to
change people's minds
in part but a special
shout out to michael shellenberger and
also mark schneider for being two
advocates for this
i certainly put my full weight of
persuasion into this fight based on
based on the expertise of two people no
more than i do
and i swear to god they moved the needle
yeah bjorn lomborg but
in the united states i think his
his impact is a little lesson because
uh he doesn't live in the united states
but but certainly i would say that bjorn
lomborg is the the og you know the the
original
the original cost-benefit guy who
actually looked at all the factors
where people weren't looking at all the
factors before
um
why do you get credit when i was saying
it decades ago
[Laughter]
all right
so
how many of you would agree that uh
schellenberger and mark schneider
moved the needle
because remember they move to people who
move people who move people so it's not
just their direct effect we're talking
about second and third order effects
so on locals everybody say yes
almost everybody
uh almost everybody says yes
i think this is one of the
oh wow even in youtube people are saying
yes
i
honestly i think this is one of the most
remarkable things
that's ever happened in the united
states
one of the most remarkable
success stories in the united states now
it's not a success yet
because you actually have to you know
build the nuclear
nuclear facilities that's going to take
a long time
oh there was a ted talk guy too
yeah
gates moved the needle most do you think
well i don't know if he did did he
i don't know i don't know if bill gates
is as persuasive as you think but maybe
he is
anyway good job to all involved however
that got done
um kevin mccarthy is gonna do something
funny if he uh if dem i'm sorry if
republicans get control of the
congress
so
i'd forgotten about this but the
democrats when they had control they
removed some republicans from committee
assignments
which apparently they could do but it's
also
apparently it's a new standard
so it used to be that no matter how much
you hated
the people on the other party if they
were on the committee they were on the
committee
but
i guess the republic the democrats
kicked off marjorie taylor green
and also paul gosar
for
they were i guess they were concerned
about the things they had said outside
of the committee work
and they decided to punish them by
taking them off these important
committees
and mccarthy is saying that that set a
new standard
so the so if uh republicans take control
they're going to use the same standard
to remove adam schiff and eric swalwell
and elon omar from their committee
assignments
i am so in favor of that
so in favor of that
i didn't see it coming at all
but the the democrats have to live with
any precedence they set right if they
set the precedent well you've got to
live with it
and the precedent they've set is if
somebody is a
a complete
disaster in their opinion
in their opinion that's all it took
if somebody is a complete disaster of a
human being in their opinion they can be
removed from a committee even if they're
doing
fine work on the committee
there's not much to say about this
except that it's awesome
you like to see
consistency come back and bite you by
people in the ass when they deserve it
well i've got some advice for murderers
are any of you murderers or plan to be
because if you'd like to get away with
your murder
i have a new idea for you
before you kill somebody
either make sure you've chosen somebody
who has an active case of covet
or that you've infected them just before
you shoot them
because
once you get into trial let's say
there's video proof and you've got
witnesses and it looks like you're going
to go to jail what you do is you produce
the death certificate certificate
and you say ladies and gentlemen of the
jury i have the death certificate
it says right here cause of death was
coveted
uh my client is accused of murdering
this person who as the experts have
concluded
did not die of a gunshot wound but
rather
covet
now you might say that when the
when the victim came into the
operating room or the emergency room he
was already missing ahead
and while it is true that a headless
human being
is dead
and it may be that under normal
circumstances the shooting off of
somebody's head would be the cause of
death but not in the specific case of a
pandemic in the pandemic we have what's
called
reasonable doubt
because if that person had coveted and
was missing ahead
sort of a jump ball isn't it
do you know if it was the missing head
or do you not or possibly or possibly
the kovid got them
just before the bullet did
can you rule it out no you can't
reasonable doubt i rest my case
ladies and gentlemen of the jury we're
done here
pretty good pretty good
if i haven't mentioned this lately
do not take my medical advice or my
legal advice and especially my financial
advice
those are three kinds of advices you
don't want to take from me
no
including that one
by the way uh i'm not serious about any
of that we'll talk about that in a
minute
i saw some pushback i guess some judge
asked
what do i do about the fact the
president meaning trump during january 6
didn't denounce the conduct immediately
how do we judge the fact that trump
did not immediately say
stop being violent
don't do it
here's my answer
do you think he knew what was happening
how could he
how would trump be the only one who knew
that it was violent
we didn't know did we
we knew that we knew that the protesters
were scuffling right because you could
you could see that that'd be in the news
you could see the scuffling
but do you think that the president knew
that the crowds would overwhelm the
security
do you think that's something he knew
now
i do not support the president of trump
i do not support his january 6 actions
so let me say that clearly
that this is not an apologist kind of
thing i i think he's got some explaining
to do and i think if you could if you if
you're
if your vote in 2024 should he run
if your vote in 2024 included that as an
important factor
and you decided to vote against him for
that
i wouldn't argue with that at all
i would say that would be pretty
reasonable in fact you could take all of
his pluses and minuses
throw it all in the hopper
and you know judge it all
you don't have to judge only the good
stuff
right you can judge the bad stuff it's
all part of the mix
i think that's part of the bad the bad
stuff in his
uh legacy but i do have to ask this
question
how much did he really know
did you know
i'm trying to play back my own memories
of this uh let me ask you this at what
point did you know
that it was beyond let's say
uh blm violence or let's say when did
you know it was a beyond antifa level
blm protest level violence or was it i
don't know maybe it wasn't
at what point did you know is beyond
what i'd call let's say a baseline
violence
where nobody gets killed but maybe you
know somebody gets punched
because i'm not sure that
yeah it was enough yeah okay
late january i i feel like the bad stuff
came out later didn't it
now by the time
by the time ashley babbitt got shot
i mean i don't know if it was too late
by that point maybe it was too late by
that point i don't know
but uh so i i don't think that anybody
can uh um
make a case that trump handled this well
i don't think you can make that case but
but you do have to ask the question how
much he knew
because
i'm not sure i'm not sure he could have
known
how bad it was
that's all i'm asking
just a question
apparently the chicago teachers were
going to do some kind of work action and
not go to school because of covid
but
the art i saw an article that says the
chicago teachers
are set to return
today i guess
so they will have school in person in
chicago
and the way it was reported is that
there was a breakthrough in union
negotiations with the city
over how to mitigate covet
now that's one way to say it that the
union negotiated with the city
is that is that what happened
was it a contest between the unions
and the city the government and that the
two of them worked it out
no
that's not the story
the story is that the public told the
teachers that they were going to teach
and that's the story
am i wrong
it was the public now i know that
negotiations were with the city but
shouldn't the story say the public
demanded that the teachers go back to
work and the teachers did
yeah they got some concessions maybe
some mitigation stuff whatever
but really what happened was the public
opinion got so strong that there was no
alternative really
the the public simply took the decision
away from the city and the public took
the decision away from the teachers
unions
am i right
that the story is that the public took
the decision back tell me i'm wrong
the only story is that the public took
the decision back
the city just implemented
right
is this real
probably not
but i would extend that and say that
remember this model
the public is in charge
of ending the pandemic
only because there's only one entity
that has the credibility to do it it's
the public
the government doesn't have credibility
to end the pandemic
or even incentive i guess
in many cases
the our our experts don't have the
credibility anymore
i mean maybe they used to but they don't
anymore only the public can end the
pandemic and here and here you saw in
the chicago example
that's the turning point
so we've now reached the turning point
where the public said you know
no
when was the
name the other time during the pandemic
that the public
pushed the government it happened
recently with the cdc going to five days
to quarantine
they didn't do that for medical reasons
they did it because the public pushed
them and they knew that they'd better
back down
so you're already seeing
the the public powering up it pushed the
cdc
to go to five days it just pushed the
chicago teachers to go back to school
the public's taken over
for good intent i mean it's exactly the
right thing is it's where you need to go
and let me
let me say this
the public is going to take over
the public is going to take over
life is short
might as well get to it
it's going to happen
all right um
and uh
teachers unions are systemic racism as
you know
doug ducey governor doug ducey of
arizona
he's making this argument listen to this
persuasion
he said in the speech 50 plus years ago
politicians stood in the schoolhouse
door and wouldn't let minorities in
today union-backed politicians stand in
the schoolhouse door and won't let
minorities out
so he's talking about letting minorities
and everybody else
take their school money and go to school
where they want to and have school
choice
an interesting framing that
we were discriminating against
minorities keeping them out of schools
but at this point we're discriminating
by not letting them have choice
correct
the other way to say this governor ducey
is to say that the teachers unions are
the source of most systemic racism in
this country
if you can get one national politician
to say that sentence
it will break the school unions
a national level politician needs to say
there is systemic racism
and most of it is because of the school
system because if you can't educate
minorities they can't lift themselves up
on their own and ultimately that's what
has to happen
you need to give them a break give them
a good school
but they got to do the rest right that's
how the systemic racism goes away not by
magic
by lots of people doing hard work to
to make it go away just by good work
so
just say the sentence just say the
sentence and
and you're going to own the topic
i saw a sign by i don't know i guess it
was a homeless guy begging for money or
something on the streets and this is
what his sign said
tip me if your girl is hot
that that was the
panhandler sign
tip me if your girl is hot
damn him
damn him
that's pretty good
it's pretty good
would you pay a dollar
so that your girl doesn't wonder if you
think she's ugly
i would
i'd pay a dollar for that that's worth a
dollar
so let's talk about the lying government
and all their numbers so the cdc says
up to forty percent of covet patients uh
are
are admitted for something else meaning
that forty percent of the surge would be
basically fake numbers
because it's just people who have some
other problem not a covet problem
but it's worse than that there was a
study at uh
um
study at
was it usf where somebody looked into
all of the hospitalizations and found
that 75 percent of them were
just coincidentally had covered
75 of them
now do you say to yourself
oh my god the pandemic was always fake
because many of those people didn't
really have a problem they were just in
the hospital for other reasons not
coveted are you saying that to yourself
don't say that to yourself
don't say that to yourself
um
yes eric you're right
here's what i say
i say that in the beginning
the over counting probably wasn't that
bad
in the beginning
probably because if you got like one of
the bad early variants
you actually were hospitalized and they
took it seriously and it really was the
reason you were in hospital probably
more often than the alternative
but now that we have omicron
and we have lots of herd immunity
shouldn't you expect that most people
who go into the hospital for any reason
would also have an infection
so i would say that the way we counted
it in the beginning of the pandemic was
probably over counted but not by much
but at the moment it's over counted by i
don't know maybe 300 percent if it's if
that 75 numbers right so we we could be
way off now because omicron and and herd
immunity and the fact i assume they're
using pcr tests so they're picking up
people who are already cured
but still have it in them
so if you put all those factors together
basically if you have a world where
everybody has omicron or has been
infected with one of the others
shouldn't almost everybody who goes into
the hospital
have a pretty high likelihood of also
having some covet in them in the next
two weeks it should be
pretty much everybody you either are
going to have active covet
or you had it recently enough that it
would show up on a pcr test
so shouldn't the hospitalizations of
people with covet reach
i don't know
90 or something at some point
so
the hospitalization numbers are garbage
but on top of that that we lose trust
now personally i've never
super trusted the hospitalization
numbers like many of you i said tell me
the death numbers
just tell me the death numbers now
uh
uh
wow i just saw a comment that's making
me shake my head
but let's talk about death numbers um i
was just reading a fact check about
death numbers now do you think that the
over counting of the hospitalizations
could be extended to say
therefore the deaths are also over
counted by maybe a similar amount who
would say that
is there anybody who would say that
deaths are probably over counted in in
much the same problem as the
hospitalizations
lots of yeses
i'm going to be on the hard no on that
hard no
um so a stronger opinion than i have on
most things
hard no i think you're all wrong
here's why
now i read a fact check but we don't we
don't trust fact checks right
okay we agree that when i tell you i
read a fact check that doesn't mean it's
true it's just somebody called it a fact
check but
it did confirm a little bit of what i
thought but not everything
so here's what i know
if you were to falsify a
hospital record
knowingly
there are pretty steep criminal
penalties did you know that
so so to believe that deaths are
falsified
you have to believe that people are
taking a a criminal risk
and an obvious one
so it's one where you you're definitely
gonna get caught if anybody wants to
look for it i mean the record would be
right there
so it's a bad crime to try to get away
with and the employees who would have to
do it or the doctor would not be the
beneficiary of the extra money
so we know that the hospitals got extra
money if they had a coven patient but it
was extra money they needed largely for
the extra mitigation and stuff for a
coveted patient
however what happens what happens so so
we do know that hospitals had an
incentive
to code things as covid
because they got more money
but that doesn't mean that they were
lying
because if they had covered they really
didn't need to treat them like a covet
patient they didn't need extra resources
so it wouldn't be lying
to code somebody as a covenant patient
and get money for it because you really
do need the money for a real thing
but it makes the data wonky right so in
that case nobody's doing anything
illegal can we agree in fact they're
doing something good
and smart
so would not be illegal or even
unethical
for the hospital to code somebody a
coven patient even if they have
comorbidities because that's how they
get the money and they do need the money
it's like really money that's offered
for that purpose
so the the way they collect the data and
the way they get the money were
incompatible
so so the way they collect the money
made the data useless
right
but i don't think anybody was criminal
in that could you agree
would you agree that i did not describe
a scam or criminal activity there was
just two systems that are incompatible
and when you want run one of the systems
the way you're supposed to the other one
breaks
no no crime
now let's take
a death so that's for hospitalizations
now let's take a death
if you're a doctor and you code that
death as a covent
what advantage do you get as a doctor go
what is the doctor's advantage
to code a gunshot wound as a cover death
does the doctor get paid extra
no
nope
somebody says to keep his job because
you think the hospital
you think the hospital
wants him to code it as a cover death
right
what does the hospital get
monetarily
for coding something a death
uh a cover death
go
how much does the hot no
isn't the 39 000 why does the hospital
get extra money if it's a cover death
here's what's going on there is there
was a rumor
uh there's some doctor who said
that those deaths
were had a financial incentive but even
the doctor who said that who started the
rumor you're believing
the person who started the rumor you're
believing
says that you shouldn't interpret it
that way
right so the data that you have is from
somebody who says don't use the data
that way
the source of the data says don't use it
that way here's what i think is
happening
i think
that hospitals get paid extra for
hospitalization because they need extra
money for the mitigation
but i think that once you die
correct me if i'm wrong
once you die
why would it cost extra
because don't they just bag you
and at that point debt is just dead
right they don't keep giving medicine to
dead people right
dead people don't get doctor care they
don't get uvs or iv drips
so
so can you explain to me under your
point of view
that there's a an incentive who gets
this money and for what
we all understand why you get mitigation
money if they're alive because you need
to keep them separated and stuff like
that but once they're dead
they were already in a covenant facility
so that part is paid for
then you bag them up
and they leave the hospital
where was the extra money
you're telling me that the hospital gets
39 000 for checking the coven box you
know that any doctor who checked that
coven box for a gunshot wound
would be risking their entire future
because that's a big crime right there
that's a big crime
and it would be obvious it'd be
documented and it's something people are
going to look for
it's not even a crime you can get away
with because people aren't looking for
it
we're all looking for this
it would be the most looked for thing in
america in a few months
do you think a doctor will do that
remember the doctor doesn't get any
extra money
and do you think that the hospital
would remove a doctor's
privileges
do you think they would remove the
privileges or fire them i suppose
uh
for coding
for coding correctly
what would a doctor do if they got fired
by a hospital for coding a gunshot
as a covet
and and the hospital said we're going to
fire you if you don't do this
what would the doctor do
the doctor would take the hospital down
now you say to yourself no scott you're
forgetting that doctors are cowards just
like everybody so they're just going to
do what their
uh
do what their
employer says
no way
no way
we're talking doctors
now a lot of doctors will be sheep
sure just like a lot of everybody but
you don't think that the class of doctor
will produce any heroes
really let's do the really test on this
i'm going to give you the really test
you tell me that the class of people who
are doctors
working in emergency on the front line
risking their life every day
you're telling me that the class of
doctors
can't produce a whistleblower
to say the doc the hospital made me code
this illegally and i wouldn't do it
really really the entire class of
doctors
can't produce a hero
is that your opinion
it produced dr malone
it produced dr mccullough
it produced dr zolenko zelensky i'm
sorry i always get his name wrong i
apologize for that
right now even if you think those three
doctors are wrong and a lot of people do
or at least wrong on some some elements
what they say they're definitely not
wrong on most things
i would say the rogue doctors are
correct on most things
you know there are some things we would
disagree with but it isn't really
practical or possible that you haven't
seen an interview with a doctor an
actual doctor who just said it
all the doctors in the country you can't
find one doctor to go on tv and say look
i had to quit the hospital look what
they made me do
how hard would it be for that doctor to
get to get another job he'd be a hero
he or she would be hero
right
stop stop with the really crap
no i think the really test is useful i
know it's annoying but it is useful
because if if you can say the really
thing and it still makes sense
it tells you something
all right um so i'm gonna say uh i'm
gonna i'm gonna go against all of you i
think really a hundred percent of you
actually let me see if anybody agrees
with me
scott is losing touch with reality
all right uh robert i'm going to
uh block you for being an with
nothing to offer the world
right
remember
criticisms with reasons
perfect
uh wild generic insults are a sign of
cognitive dissonance
and let me say that again
if your response to me is just an insult
with no anything else
that is just cognitive dissonance
it is
if you give me a reason
then i'd say oh there's a person with a
different opinion
but if you just insult me
you're just gonna be written off as
somebody who's hypnotized and not worth
any attention whatsoever
so if you'd like to prove yourself
completely worthless
just put in a a mindless
flailing insult
to show that you have nothing to offer
the world
you know you just advertise your
uselessness right now
please
if there's anybody else who wants to be
a useless piece of
step up
i'd like to see you flailing away with
your your dumb little insults adding
nothing to the world go ahead
go nuts
all right
uh you know nothing about the medical
industry john
you're gonna wait for being an
because none of us know everything about
the medical industry i'm only relying on
other people here's what i do know i do
know how to detect
not every time nobody's that good but
i do have one skill
and it is to detect among
experts and i believe i've demonstrated
that skill many times and i'm
demonstrating it again and
you don't have to insult me for this
opinion
you can just wait
because i think this is one will know
the answer
would you agree that we will probably
know the answer eventually maybe in a
year about how many of the deaths were
not really covades
would you agree
i think we'll know the answer in a year
don't you think
somebody says no a lot of people say no
we won't know the answer
why not
i feel like it would be too easy to
investigate that
huh
interesting that you don't think so well
i'm going to say we will know the answer
i'll disagree with most of you and i
will say that the death count
might be overstated
but it might be understated
and it won't be nearly as bad as the
hospitalization's numbers are so that's
my my prediction
is the death rates
won't be good
but they won't be nearly as bad as the
hospitalization numbers and there's
obvious reasons for that
all right
project veritas put out something
that has stumped even eric weinstein or
weinstein weinstein
i would like to offer a blanket apology
apology to everybody's name who can be
pronounced more than one way
i am not going to pronounce your name
correctly
if there are two possible pronunciations
for the same name
i just can't do it it's beyond my
ability i take full responsibility for
it
and i
apologize to the brothers eric and brett
because i know i say their name wrong
every time and there's no amount of
times you can tell me
that will make me remember it correctly
and that that's on me so please don't
take this as an insult when i use when i
say your name wrong there's no bad
intention here
but
i loved watching eric weinstein
try to deal with this new project
veritas
dump they've got some kind of official
looking documents
and i barely want to describe them
because it's so not clear what we're
seeing and it doesn't look real
and that was sort of
eric's take on it was can you tell me
what i'm seeing
because it looks bad
but i don't want to say that i believe
it because i'll get kicked off of
twitter
and so watching
watching somebody with you know a super
high iq
trying to navigate talking about
something that's you know real
meaning that there was a real project
veritas report
talking about something real
but not knowing how to talk about a real
thing without getting kicked off of
social media and watch it watching him
try to like navigate the topic
in real life and realizing he has to say
directly
to to twitter and ask them directly not
to kick him off for just talking about
something
that's the world we're in so that that
alone was interesting but the the dump
is something about um some american
created
entity
that was before the uh
before the pandemic but not too much
before in which they were trying to
create
you know
some kind of a bat vaccine or precursor
virus
to covid
and if somebody held the eco health
alliance program and blah blah now as
brian machiavelli on twitter noted about
this story
it's too on the nose
meaning that this story looks exactly
like a fake
which doesn't mean it is right doesn't
mean it is
but if you were to predict
that something's a little too perfect
they usually aren't true so that's what
um brian said a little too on the news
but he tweeted it the same as i did
because
project veritas
doesn't have a perfect record
but they have broken real stories
and and lots of them actually
so
to imagine that project veritas is just
giving you something that's not true
well anything's possible
but i think you've got to go immediately
with sort of a
take as seriously approach until you
know more
so
uh i'm just going to say
you need to know more about this story
but i would bet against it being real
anybody want to disagree if you saw the
story it's i'm not even sure this will
make headlines
i've decided to remove long-haul covid
from my cost-benefit analysis
and here's the reason
we should be talking about it all the
time on the news or
or it's not real
because that was one of my biggest
factors
for getting the vaccination because we
seem to be talking about a lot about the
time i made the decision but i feel like
it just left the headlines
but
does that make it not real
well here's what i know
i know people personally
who are very credible
dr drew being top of the list
who are quite sure they had something
called long-haul covet
and when you hear their description of
it it sounds like it couldn't be
anything else
now
would even the people who say they had
it agree with the following statement
there could be coincidental problems
that happen after
uh vaccinations or even after covet
that you imagine or caused by the
vaccination or by the covet
everybody would agree with that right
that that will be some coincidental
medical problems that are not caused by
either one of those things and it would
and you would expect
that with you know 200 i don't know how
many millions of people 3 70 million or
something with all those people either
getting coveted or getting vaccinations
you'd expect tens of millions of people
to say
they had a bad medical outcome after a
vaccination
or after covent
right
am i wrong that tens of millions would
be a reasonable number
just by chance
there should be tens of millions of
reports
anybody disagree with that estimate
that only by chance whether it's real or
not
real or not
that many people having that experience
there should be tens of millions who had
a bad medical experience directly after
yeah so
the fact that
millions of people
report
what looks to all
to all observation like either a side
effect of the covet or a side effect of
the vaccine
how much weight should you put on that
well i'll tell you if it comes from a dr
drew i put a lot of weight on it
because you know he would be sensitive
to the
you know the the risk that it's
imaginary as well as
you know doing a deeper dive on how real
it is
so
it's very very convincing that it's real
but now let me give you some context
that might change your mind because i
changed mind
i've had
two minor surgeries in my life two
yeah two
oh and
uh no three
they're all minor two of them were like
nasal
sinus related
and and they're the kind of things where
you're up and walking the next day
right
so i'm saying it's a minor surgery if
you're up and walking the next day
so one was for my voice so they just did
some nerve nerve stuff in the front of
my neck didn't even open up the interior
of my neck just just nerves like right
below the surface
so three minor surgeries
it took me six months to recover from
all of them
the real recovery period was a few weeks
but i was up
for six months after each of those
meaning that i couldn't exercise
effectively
had trouble walking upstairs
i mean i was up
and there were minor surgeries like in
every case i was literally up and
walking around and you know like the
next day
now
here's my
uh
so and one of the drugs that messed me
up the most was prednisone
so getting off a prednisone
is
really unpleasant if you've been on it
too long which is what that happened to
me because i was on it too long waiting
for surgery during covet surgery kept
getting you know delayed i had to be on
it too long
so uh the the pandemic really hurt me
uh health-wise
like it set me back
a year
i i would say that my physical fitness
reached its lowest point of my life
during the pandemic
because of the surgery not because of
the pandemic
and you know it's back to really good
now so i'm fine now so here's my
observation
that after anybody has any medical event
that's kind of traumatic
it's not that unusual to have months of
after effect is it
and the people who got coven and really
got the kick your ass covered not not
the no symptoms coveted but the ones
that really got their ass kicked to me
that feels like surgery a minor surgery
it feels like
it could be that we always
always have months of problems after any
major medical or even minor surgery
and maybe it's just ordinary
somebody said up to a year for you after
surgery
so how many of you could um confirm to
me that you've had months
of what seems to be fatigue or some some
related problem like fatigue or
breathing or something after what had
been
a normal
was the vasectomy bad
yeah so so some of you agree with that
right so
now does that make long coved real or
not real
well by that definition it's as real as
the long surgery
right
so i had minor surgery but i suffered
from long-haul surgery and everything
worked right i'm talking about a
completely successful operation no no
side effects
beyond what i'm talking about
yeah knee took 18 months somebody says
so i have a feeling that long haul code
is real in the sense that anything that
kicks the out of you can affect you
for six months
but that doesn't mean you would
necessarily take it into consideration
because when i decided to get my minor
surgeries
did i did i at any point did i calculate
well
i could have months of you know bad
recovery time none it was never a factor
so even though it's real
i never factored it in because it was
temporary like i knew it'd be a few
months of this and then it's done
could it be that long-haul covent is
just more of that
anything that kicks your ass kicks your
ass for a long time that's it that's
just the whole thing and it's not
different from covid than any normal ass
kicking thing that happens to you so
if long-haul coved sort of resolves
itself in six months i would say that i
wouldn't even consider that part of the
decision
because it's sort of like every other
big medical thing all right
i'll just put that out there uh and i
noticed that the news seems to be
talking about it less
but then somebody sent me a few stories
where people are talking about it so
maybe it's just i've i've seen it less
all right um here's the thing the deal i
think we should make with our government
and by deal i mean just tell them what
we're going to do
on february 1st which is sort of the
target date
that the public is setting for its
government and the
masking and other restrictions
at least the unreasonable ones
um
if the major news sources are not even
reporting the death rate by then
you know there's no ticker
it's not the news they don't even
mention the number
if there's no news source that's
mentioning the death rate on february
1st
uh and the cdc can't give us those
numbers accurately
in other words if we don't have
confidence the cdc even knows how many
people are dying
because right now the numbers are very
much in question
and it's not being reported
mass go away meaning that the public
the public has
a right to demand
that we are given the information on
this risk
if we are not given the information by
the news
and
we don't trust it if we got it
you don't make decisions based on that
stuff
if you don't have information on a thing
you don't make a decision on it i mean
if it's a fog of war sometimes you have
to take guesses
but if there's a thing that may be a
thing and not a thing you just go on
with your life you don't change your
life because there might be a thing
somewhere that's a thing
because you know your entire life
you're surrounded with infinite things
that could be a problem but aren't
so
if the pandemic falls into the category
of things that
could be a problem
but we don't have any information that
would say it is
then
i don't think you can manage your life
around it because you don't manage your
life around any of the other things
that could be a problem but probably not
so
this would be what i call the fake
because
uh i've described this concept before in
influence
sometimes people need a reason to do the
things they want to do
a lot of people want to end the mandates
but they can't get there
in other words the public is i'll just
say for conversation purposes let's say
half of the public wants to get well 75
let's say 75 percent of the public wants
to get rid of the mass right away
but they sort of need to convince you
know the rest of the public
the rest of the public needs a reason
and
i can't tell if that's a joke but you
could block for it anyway
um they need a reason and in in
persuasion there's something that i call
the fake because
it's the reason
that's not a good reason but they just
need a reason
and so the the reason would be if you're
not reporting the death rate and you're
not even sure what the death rate is
that's the reason
you have to give us data or don't ask us
to make a decision
based on imaginary data i guess
so i think that's the standard we could
live with
so
there's a well street journal article
that i had that i disagree with but i
might be wrong
it says that we might be doing the wrong
thing by trying to slow omicron
and and the idea here is that if we all
get omicron quickly
this is i'm not suggesting this is a
good idea by the way that if we all get
omicron quickly then there's less chance
for a variant that's that would be like
the worst variant in the world to emerge
that's wrong isn't it
here's why i think it's wrong
i think this rule is inviolate
the more virus the more variance
i i don't think there's an exception to
that
the more virus
the more variants
now if you take two scenarios where we
get omicron quickly
everybody gets it
versus it takes a while for everybody to
get it
isn't it the same amount of virus
why would the why would the variant risk
change with time
because it's not time that matters
except the time is the variable that
you know influences quantity
but quantity is what gives you variance
right
it's not
because because does the individual
virus mutate
is that what's happening
so
so i'm not i'm not confident that i'm
right
i'm just trying to understand the math
of it
so
yeah so so here's my uh
statement i'll take some expert's
opinion whether this makes sense
if everybody's going to get a omicron
it's the same amount of virus whether we
get it quickly or get it slowly is that
part right
i'm right about that right
if everybody's going to get it
in one month or two months it's exactly
the same amount of virus because it's
one person with virus
walking around
and if you were to measure it it
wouldn't matter if you measured it next
month or this month
the scott's amount of virus would be
exactly the same quantity
no matter when i get it
right
let's see here's
flu variants happen all the time yeah
they happen all the time but just just
answer my one question
why would variance be more
if i were to get coveted next month
instead of this month or less why would
that matter
uh
okay
you assume a static model
do i
no i assume that i haven't been provided
a model that's competing with the one i
gave you
all right well i don't know
so
i just have a question on that and it's
weird that we can't even know that
doesn't that seem like that feels like
that should have been virus 101 and we
should all be informed to at least
understand virus 101 right
virus 101 is more more virus means more
variance and i don't know how that's
wrong
so
but probably is by the way i'm not
confident of that opinion i'm not at all
confident in the opinion i just don't
know why it's wrong
greater incubation time
but in what
each individual gets the virus and they
incubate at the same amount that they
would incubate it if they get it next
month or this month
incubation time should be exactly the
same
right
or not but then also the longer you wait
the more attenuated viruses tend to get
they they don't tend towards super
variants
they tend toward
milder vaccinations
all right well that's all i got for
today i think you'd agree this is the
best live stream
ever seen in the
entire world
and
rand paul is going after fauci again
fauci
overall more time to vary
yeah but time isn't the variable is it
does it does the
i just don't know that
ah i don't know it's a tough one and
it's also frustrating that that's not an
easier question because i feel like
i feel like i should already know for
sure what what's going on there
no variable is the host
time plus spread here so here's what i'm
saying i think that when you add time
the time is just a proxy for a quantity
that that might be the problem let's
boil it down to that i say that when
you're talking about
variance over time
the time is just the number you use to
indirectly refer to quantity because you
get more quantity over time
i might be wrong
probably wrong actually probably wrong
just let me know that's all i got for
now youtube oh well what was that last
question there got a five dollar
question slow spread gives time for
another variant to catch up
that's true
slow spread gives time for another
variant to catch up
but the variance
the math of it is that they tend to get
um lesser
yeah slow time gives
but is that true
yeah i guess that would be true okay i'm
going to accept that as
as the answers
it's about giving time for the other
variants to catch up
okay
so if one person created a variant let's
say there's one individual who gets a
variant
and if they
they hid for two weeks then everybody
else might get regular omicron and then
they're they can't affect anybody but if
they immediately went out and ran around
with people
people would get their their super
variant quicker
before the omicron
protected them yeah okay
all right there you go
my mind was changed
in real time
i now
reverse my opinion
now you see how useful it is when
somebody puts an actual reason in a
comment
instead of just these weird
like random insults
did you see how quickly somebody could
completely change my mind with one
sentence
the the one sentence was
more time for the other variants to
compete
and i thought oh okay we're done here
yeah that that's actually a good reason
um and by the way this is uh i've told
you before one of the ways to know if
your own opinion is good is if you can
write it down and it still makes sense
so there was a case of somebody who
could write it down
very very short way
that's all you needed
so if you can write it down and it makes
sense you have a coherent opinion but if
you can't write it down
and all you say is stuff like i'm stupid
you probably didn't have a coherent
opinion
you only read the monkey comments we've
been screaming this at you for 10
minutes
uh what's the monkey oh the money
comments
you only read the money comments we've
been screaming this you for ten ten
minutes what money comments
uh here's shelley
scott's uh
scott's thousand dollar life is short
we'll know you got duped by covid
because your friends scared you into
trying to save the world
time to apologize we'll accept it we're
running out of patience
shelley you you stupid
uh let me say that you are a piece of
 do not tell people what
they think and then insult them in
public
right you can tell me what you
think you small-minded piece of crap but
don't tell me what i think and then
insult me in public when you're
wrong because here's the thing
i was definitely scared about
civilization
but that's not had nothing to do with
getting a vaccination because that scare
came long before the vaccinations were
available and by the time the
vaccinations were available i wasn't
afraid of the civilization failing so
you got your facts wrong you got your
timing wrong you got your thinking wrong
and you're a piece of
because you should not live in the world
with other nice people because i got a
feeling you're just as much of a piece
of when you go home i'll bet your
family hates your guts behind
your back i guarantee it
with that kind of an attitude the fact
that you can come after me with your
 imaginary problems
put them in my head and then blame them
for me means that your family is
probably getting the same treatment i
feel sorry for your husband i hope your
husband's watching because he's agreed
with me right now he's nodding with me
yes you are an imaginary stirring
probably a narcissist
piece of
that's what i think of you shelley
so i wouldn't join these uh live streams
again if i were you
and by the way that probably demonetized
me but that was worth
that was worth a thousand dollars
or whatever it is
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you tomorrow
