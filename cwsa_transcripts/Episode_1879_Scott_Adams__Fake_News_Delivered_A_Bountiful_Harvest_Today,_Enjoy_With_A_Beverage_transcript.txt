foreign
good morning everybody
oh you are better looking and smarter
than you've ever been before and that's
good because you've reached the Pinnacle
of human civilization it's called coffee
with Scott Adams yeah you've heard of it
you've all heard of it
and you're there
imagine
being at the center of the most
important thing that's ever happened
and you were there you'll always
remember
where you were when this coffee was
Scott Adams happened
in order to take it up to those lofty
levels and we know where it belongs all
you need is a cup or a mug or a glass of
tanker jealous is dying a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
enjoy me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
okay
well let's start off with the most
important story of the day
apparently there's this teen chess
phenomenon phenom
um who beat some World chess champion
yeah but the teen is being accused of
cheating
and of course I tried to check to see if
any kind of you know electronic
listening devices that he was being
coached or something and by process of
elimination they've since they couldn't
find anything externally
uh he's being accused of possibly having
vibrating anal beads
that would tell him where to move
by his coach
now what I really wonder is did the team
learn
Morse code
how exactly do the
the anal beads communicate because
they're not talking it's not words
so
could it be Morse code
hold on hold on I'm sorry a little
Interruption I'm getting a call
um
okay
um
go on
got it
sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you I
just had an incoming call
but I I this technology seems
seems highly unlikely to be true
it's your first story of the day
I don't think I should have started with
that one because I can't top it
I can't top it
now suppose they found out that he was
actually guilty of having anal beads to
win his chess
is uh his Chester yeah
uh do you think that he should be
punished for that
or should we turn the other cheek
anybody anybody
uh no uh
he did not have a hummingbird shoved up
his ass it was anal beads pretty sure of
it but perfectly intelligent question to
ask
well the nordstream pipeline
seems to have uh sprung a leak Natural
Gas
um now it's interesting that the news
does not talk about this natural gas
leak
as being a ecological problem is that
because the gas just goes to the surface
and just sort of gets released doesn't
hurt anything
because it's not liquid grass right it's
it's just gas gas like a gaseous liquid
not a gaseous liquid but a cloud gas
kind of thing it just dissipates so the
I guess the economy the ecology is not
the big problem but the the pipeline was
shut down already so it was just
whatever was left in it and so it wasn't
delivering anything so that that part
won't make a difference but the
Denmark's prime minister says it's hard
to imagine that the leaks
were accidental
because of the timing of it and the
problems with Russia but who exactly
would have the incentive to attack the
pipeline
would it be the pro-russia side or the
anti-russia side
Germany said it was Ukraine I'm
speculating right
now why would Ukraine do that
why would they do that
I'm trying to figure out the
because then money goes to Russia
but do you think Ukraine would take the
chance of being caught
decreasing the amount of energy to
Europe
I I don't know there's something about
the story that doesn't quite fit
because somebody would have to have a
lot of resources to
to attack an underwater pipeline
wouldn't they that's not something a
fisherman can do
so somebody with some resources would
have to have a reason if that's why it
was done
but it could be a coincidence
we do live in a world where coincidences
happen
let me tell you about the weirdest one
that happened to me yesterday
well the other day
so the other day I was in my man cave
thinking up ideas and I said to myself
why do I hire somebody to clean my
gutters my rain gutters of my house
because I do I hire somebody to do it
and I thought that's like the silliest
thing to have to hire somebody to do
like why isn't there some kind of long
Pole
that you can just reach up there and
grab what's ever in there like and just
clean it with the pole now you'd have to
be able to you know see what was up
there and be able to manipulate up there
now here's the weird part here's the
weird part
I thought this I never talked about it I
never said a word out loud I never wrote
about it I never texted about it didn't
even write it on my whiteboard
it was literally just a thought
but it was a long thought I mean I spent
some time thinking about it the very
next day
um oh damn I'm using my phone so I can't
show you I'm using my phone to
to do the live streams I can't show you
but the very next day an advertisement
appeared on my web page never seen it
before of the invention I imagined
my imagination
turned into an advertisement within 24
hours
now you would say well that's just
coincidence or some kind of common
Consciousness thing or whatever I don't
think so
my my V my current view of the world and
of course all views of reality have to
be
um let's say not certain right you just
have a working theory of reality that's
the best you can do because we don't
know reality we just have a working
Theory my working theory is that we're
causing it
I think we think into existence things
that wouldn't have happened
on their own that if lots of people
weren't thinking about it it wouldn't
happen so here we have this situation
where the whole world is thinking about
these Pipelines
can the whole world thinking about a
pipeline cause a leak
in my world view yes
that that is exactly how I understand
the reality I'm in that if everybody's
thinking about the pipeline they could
break it
that's literally how I see the world
that that's my
now I'm not saying that you should or
that it's true in some like absolute
sense I'm saying that there are so many
times that I think into existence
things that could it just doesn't look
like an accident like this pipeline I
agree with the uh Denmark's prime
minister it doesn't look like a
coincidence
it looks like I caused it
not me specifically but you know us we
thinking about the pipelines I think we
broke it I don't know possible
I just put that out there because it's a
weird thought
all right well I'm learning a little bit
more about China's population problem
and I did the dumbest tweet anybody ever
did
because I I wasn't clear
I thought it was a good point but it
wasn't clear he said here's what I
tweeted and then all the NPCs can come
in and say the obvious thing right so
there's an obvious thing
I want all of you to just run and say
the most obvious thing and here's my
tweet
who predicted
that uh
that China would run out of people
because that that appears to be one of
the biggest problems in the world is
that China
will run out of people
and I said who predicted that
what's the most obvious thing to say go
ahead get it out of your system
get it out of your system please right
you could say Elon you could say you
could say you knew you could say I I
said it Peter's Anne that's the that's
the one I was looking for Peter Zan so
probably would you say that for at least
10 or maybe 20 years we've been talking
about the possibility of a Chinese
population collapse would you agree with
that statement that for 10 or 20 years
we have been talking about it population
collapse right
10 or 20 years
so that's why my tweet sucked because my
assumption was you would assume what I
assumed which is in your childhood
it would seem impossible right because I
grew up thinking there would be nothing
but more Chinese and even limiting the
population wouldn't even work like it
would still be you know more Chinese
forever
and now the opposite is happening so yes
I will acknowledge that you all knew
five years ago would you agree we all
knew five years ago but that wasn't the
point I just I said it very unclearly
and that's on me
um
so do you know why China's uh population
is decreasing let's see how smart you
are
can you tell me why China's population
is not growing as fast as they needed to
go
uh the one child rule for many years
right so it was the one child thing
right obviously
obviously obviously if China has a one
child rule
what doesn't happen
having two children
so what could be more obvious
than that right
okay so we could all agree
though because we're pretty smart people
that the one child policy is the reason
for the lower population growth okay
everybody is there anybody disagrees
there's no disagreement with that right
okay because we're all smart
um did you know that Taiwan has a lower
birth rate than China
and Taiwan never had a one child policy
yeah that up your brain did it
yeah you had chewing that for a little
while the one child policy wasn't it
that wasn't the reason now obviously you
had to have some impact you know it's
impossible that it had no impact
but if you're saying that the reason is
the one child policy you have to explain
Taiwan lower birth rate than China
what is the other explanation affluence
and moving to the cities
agricultural people have more kids
because they need them City people have
fewer kids because it's harder to have
kids in the city
there you go now China has an extra
problem on top of that which is they
don't have the right balance of men to
women so they have so China has a second
order problem coming that presumably
Taiwan won't if they have it closer to
the same number of people
so so Taiwan one could imagine could
survive the lower population
whereas I don't know if China can the
the Too Many Men problem is unless you
start a war what do you do about that
um
so our massive prostitution or something
which actually probably won't be the
answer China is going to have to have
massive prostitution just to keep all
these single men from staging a
revolution or something
all right
um here's another Factor uh on China's
population problem uh I mentioned this
but I didn't know anything about it so I
know a little bit more about it now so
in China they've got this system called
who cow
h-u-k-o-u the bottom line is that you
have to be sort of registered as a
resident wherever it is you live
and if you're registered as a resident
they know everything about you but your
rights are limited to where you live you
can't go to another city and get a job
now I didn't know that did you know that
did you know in China you can't go to
another city and get a job because
you're not registered in that City you
can't get a job
so here's the problem if you're a uh a
young couple getting married
let's say you're two professionals
the odds of both of you being able to
get a good job in the same city are not
really 100 percent
so it turns out that there's a trend of
young Chinese people getting married and
living and working in separate cities
because that's the only place they can
pursue the kind of career they want
so that the baby making just has to wait
so they actually have a system that
makes it so hard now you ask yourself
well why don't they get rid of that
system
yeah isn't the obvious question why do
they have that system
what the hell benefit is that and the
answer is it keeps
internal Mass migration from happening
what you don't want is all the people
who live in this shitty City
to say hey that other city is better
we'll we'll just move over there
so apparently Mass
internal immigration
was so disruptive that they had to clam
down on it
now it seems to me they're gonna have to
get rid of that
phase down somehow it seems to me that
if they don't have an easy exception for
married people
I mean really
China couldn't figure out an exception
for married people
well that feels like a solvable problem
right but yeah and maybe has to do with
the uyghurs who knows you know maybe
that's all related
here's one of the questions that I have
have you ever noticed that Elon Musk is
smart
and that he doesn't seem to lie a lot I
mean I can't think of an example
have you noticed that and when Elon Musk
says something's true and you didn't
think it was true
what happens to your brain
do you immediately say well I guess Elon
Musk had a good run but he's wrong about
this
or do you say to yourself oh shoot I
thought I was right but Elon Musk says
the opposite so I'm going to change my
opinion to whatever he says
now I have that philosophy
that if Elon Musk tells me I'm wrong
about something I immediately I
immediately discard my old opinion
and at the very least I go to uncertain
all right so Elon Musk can move me
immediately
from pretty sure to completely uncertain
just because he has a different opinion
and other people can do that too in the
legal context dershowitz could do it to
me right if dershowitz told me I was
wrong about whatever dumbass legal
opinion I had I would immediately go to
at least uncertain
if not I'll write a great
so here's the problem with what musk is
saying he's saying we could basically
handle all of our energy needs with uh
with solar
if we had enough solar plants it would
take a small part of the country and now
of course we don't have a a grid that
can carry it but conceptually it
wouldn't take much of the country
yeah you couldn't really put it in one
place you'd want to spread it out
because of the grid
um so here's the first question is Elon
Musk correct in his math
are you going to question his math
that there's some number of solar panels
that would give us everything we need so
long as we had enough batteries
to get through the no sun parts
true or false
true or false that it's physically
possible
I don't know but I'm at least uncertain
about it I'm definitely not going to bet
against them
but here's the next question
why do all the smart people the ones you
think are the smart people why do they
say there's no physical way you could
get enough raw Earth minerals not raw
Rare Earth minerals
so why do all the smart people say you
couldn't possibly get to that future
with all the batteries that we need and
all the electric cars you can't get
anywhere near it because the amount of
raw earth materials they could possibly
get would be this much
if you're listening I'm holding my
fingers very close together this much
that's how much we have and then how
much we'd need to get to this sort of
mostly Electric World how much we need
would be like this much
and if you're listening I'm holding my
arms very far apart to contrast to the
tiny little finger distance I had been
showing before
now why don't I understand that
how could I be a functioning citizen of
Earth
and I don't know why Elon Musk thinks
that that shortage of critical materials
is not an obstacle
at least not an obstacle that's going to
stop us
why now is he is he betting on a whole
new technology coming into existence
now there is I'm seeing a lot of
advertisements on mostly on Instagram
and I I'm not going to put any
credibility behind this I'm just telling
you what I saw there's some company
named Bolt
b-o-l-t they've got some kind of new
battery technology that they're hyping
that doesn't seem to require the rare
earth minerals and I believe there are
some other types that also don't require
that now is that what Elon Musk is
betting on
and if he is why is he building Mega
factories
for the existing technology
you know shouldn't we be hearing by now
that he's at least
considering at least considering
funding an alternate battery company or
buying one or spinning up another you
know Alternate Source of batteries
right so I guess I guess there's a big
mystery here and we as informed citizens
should know the answer
which is is there a way around this
shortage of rare earth materials
you know if you sat down with Elon would
he say oh yeah I look into all the new
batteries of course
do you think he doesn't
do you think that Elon Musk is aware of
the newest best alternative Battery
Technology of course he is because every
one of them went to him first right I
mean that's an exaggeration but you know
he's too tapped in to not know about
that stuff
so what does he know that we don't
I'd like to know
all right
um
I saw actor Anthony Mackey
uh who plays a superhero in
some of those movies which superhero
does he play
Nighthawk or something what's his
character
Falcon oh he plays Falcon right
so he's a superior named Falcon but
anyway one of his points was that people
people remember now the names of the
character like the superhero but they
they don't recognize the star as
superstars
that's a good point because I've been
watching his movies for years and I
didn't know his name was Anthony Mackey
talk about making a good point
I didn't know his name I've been
watching this guy for years right pretty
good actor I like him never never once
heard his name
but his name is Anthony Mackey anyway he
says that movies today are no good
because they're only making movies for
16 year olds in China and that's it you
know and people cheered and said oh
that's true they're only making movies
for 16 year olds in China
that's not exactly true
let me let me tell you two things that
16 year olds and Chinese citizens don't
like
you ready
everything in the movies the wokeness
one 16 year old likes walking us
what Chinese citizen likes their movies
with lots of wokeness make sure the
women are the strong ones
I I feel as if they they created a
market this to uh to Anthony mackie's
point which is not bad they made a
market that's only for 16 year olds and
then Chinese and then they change their
product so that the two groups that
would least like it would be 16 year
olds and Chinese people
I'm exaggerating but that's kind of
what's happening it's like they've
actually
manage their own destruction by doing
the things that would obviously put them
out of business
let's make movies that will are
definitely the opposite of what our
target market wants to see
okay
you know I tweeted today that the least
useful political opinion in the world
is if you believe there's some policy or
another is really about control
have you ever found yourself saying that
oh that that policy that that plan that
those other people want that's just
about control have you ever said that
well what good is that
what have you ever changed that wasn't
about control
everything you do is about control
it's like saying air exists there is air
I'm trying to control you right now
you're trying to control me right now
right I I see your comments that are
clearly meant to you know sometimes
people say you know move to the next
topic and whatever it totally controls
me you you think that doesn't make a
difference it does am I trying to get
you to show up every day at the same
point absolutely I'm totally trying to
control you you're trying to control me
I'm trying to control you my dog is
trying to control me when I'm done
she'll try to make me give her a treat
it's just everything
so to say this somebody has a goal of
controlling you is nothing of course
they do
so do you
so does everybody
all right but more about that
so I think that that whole control thing
feels like movie thinking
we unfortunately get our understanding
of reality from movies and fiction and I
feel like people think oh there's some
kind of Evil Genius who's going to plot
control me
um now let's get back to this world
economic forum who says uh and many of
you believe that the world economic
Forum uh said that in the future you
won't earn it you own anything you'll be
happy
you won't own anything and you'll be
happy
so the world economic performance Forum
said that right and so that means
they're trying to take your control
and make sure you don't own anything
because then they can control everything
right is that what it is
okay
you know that none of this happened
right
the the Tweet which does exist that
Tweed does exist there's a world
economic Forum tweet that did say
in the future you know some date in the
future you wouldn't own anything and
you'd be happy about it
did that sound like what they wanted to
happen
all right here's the context it was on a
list of predictions and what they were
talking about is stuff like uber
that instead of like buying a tool that
you would only use once
you'd have a drone deliver it you'd use
it once and then you'd return it
like like your Uber this is something
now
are you afraid that the world economic
Forum made some predictions that are
exactly like everybody else's
that's what you're worried about you're
worried about the world economic Foreman
Forum because they made a prediction
that's the same as yours and everyone
else's that we will be we will be
borrowing and renting more things
because that will be a new industry that
allows us to do it and it's just because
delivery costs are lower that's all it
means
now do you think that it meant that you
wouldn't have the option of owning
something do you think it meant that
no it meant that you would you would
actually prefer it
they're not making you do it
they're saying that the market is likely
to prefer it and so the market will go
where the market wants to go and then
the free market people will choose not
to own things that they don't have to
pay extra for
Now Blake says how naive
Me Now Blake we're getting to you next
I believe that in a real Sense part of
the world lives in like a movie version
of an imaginary world
and they see the things in sort of movie
terms because I don't think that they
really think it's real
I think some people walk around
believing that the things in you know
immediately around them are real
but then everything we talk about on TV
or on the Internet is sort of part of
the imaginary world
where you can imagine there are villains
and their two sides and everything's
kind of clean and you know you can
really know who's doing what but how
many of you believe
the following
that there is some group of Elites I
don't know some group of Elites who are
having conversations about keeping the
underclass
and underclass so that they personally
can can gain more
do you think that conversation is like
literally happening in actual
conversation you know if we keep the
common people where they are
then the rich can continue enjoying
their benefits
a lot of people do
a lot to do
and you don't think that sounds crazy
no no now let me ask this
well instead of a question I'm going to
put this in uh form of a hypothesis
I believe that there are two kinds of
people in the world because there are
always two kinds of people in the world
for every topic
one kind of person has been close to
power
as I have
now would you call me an elite I mean
I'm not like the billionaire Elites that
you think are running capitalism
but you know I've been behind the
curtain right
you know that I know plenty of
billionaires personally
right I could have a conversation I
could call you I don't know any one of
20 billionaires tomorrow and have a
personal conversation with
probably completely candidly
I have never once in my life
heard anybody at any level of power or
control
talk in the way
that you imagine they do
ever not even close
and nobody's even said that they know
somebody else who talks that way
it just literally doesn't exist
right and and those that you think
you've seen a video of them talking that
way it's always out of context it's not
real
there's no real billionaires who are
having these conversations nor would
they they don't even make sense
by the time you get to become a
billionaire you're not thinking about uh
how can I oppress the little people
better to make more money
literally nobody thinks like that nobody
there's nobody in the world I'll bet not
one person ever anywhere in the world
and if you could find one
find for example find me a servant who
overheard a conversation
find me a whistleblower
who is an elite who doesn't agree with
the elites but knows what they're
talking about
no whistleblowers
right no no hidden no no documents have
been discovered
everything that you think you know is
evidence is just in a context
all right
um so here's the point
the the speculation that many of you
have about the elites having these
conversations
is based on the fact that you've never
been around any Elites
that's my opinion now I can be disproved
but I don't think that people who spend
time around really rich people have that
opinion because it would be so opposite
of how anybody is thinking I mean
couldn't it be I've gone my whole life
and haven't met one person who's ever
had anything like that opinion
not even close
and I'm telling you I meet a lot of
really rich people it's sort of my
normal
normal experience none of them talk like
that
all right I'll never convince you right
would you agree that I'll never convince
you that there is not a cabal of Elites
plotting to
take your control
right
we we can agree that I will never
convince you
would you agree that I have uh that I'm
closer to it than you are
would you agree that I have some
let's say I have an angle on this that
maybe you don't
Maybe I'm Wrong maybe I'm wrong but
would you agree that I have uh like a
let's say more more observational
opportunities because I hang around with
the people that you're talking about
yeah so
and somebody else just said that they're
also close to the elite and they've
never heard it
so here's what I would challenge you
I offer you this challenge
find me an elite
who is who will report that that
conversation never happened with anybody
because you know billionaires don't like
each other right
have you ever noticed that
they're not all in like one Club there's
like Democrat billionaires and
Republican billionaires and other
countries have billionaires they're not
all in the same team
so the best way to see all of this is
competing interests
that you know the billionaires are not
on the same team they're fighting each
other and they really don't think about
the common people at all
so you imagine that they're looking to
suppress the common people and the truth
is they don't think about it at all it's
just labor
that's it
all right
um
I saw you know now that this uh Italian
uh election is over we're hearing a lot
of the old uh Hitler stuff
and I'm going to try to start this
hashtag Hitler goggles
because I'm really getting tired of the
people who can only see the world
through a Hitler filter
well uh I think I'll have some cake
well the that cake is a it's a vanilla
cake that's that's more like Hitler than
the chocolate cake
everything doesn't have to be con
compared to Hitler it really doesn't
um and so I was wondering could science
invent some some kind of corrective lens
where when you read the news and you
thought oh Heller the corrective lens
would sort of change the text
and maybe give you a non-hitler view of
it
yeah yeah if we could just de-hitlerize
our our goggles for a little bit that'd
be cool
I like that
um
and uh more importantly
um I would like you to adopt the
following strategy that I use all the
time
do not debate with people who start with
an analogy
don't
do not in fact say whoa I don't argue
analogies but if you want to argue this
situation I'd be happy to
just don't it's so tempting and I do it
all the time so I'm I don't follow my
own in that my own advice because it's
too easy to be weak and go oh I'm going
to argue that analogy do not here's what
you say when somebody really insists
that you argue the analogy you say Well
that's you're describing a different
situation
if you'd like to discuss a different
situation we can after we're done with
this one
but what you're learning from something
that has a little bit in common with
this is nothing useful so I don't want
to be part of a conversation about an
analogy but if you'd like to talk about
what we know
and also you know some logic and reason
I'm all for you but analogies would be
really what people who have never
learned to think use instead
let me say it again
we we use analogies usually when we
don't have an argument usually now I use
them all the time
so is it because I don't have an
argument usually it's because I'm in a
hurry
honestly
I I'll throw out an analogy because I
think they're funny or it'll just leave
you something to chew on I'm not
interested in the argument but if I give
you an analogy probably I'm not serious
about the conversation at all I'm
probably just trying to provoke you
I just tried to get you to like you know
reveal yourself or something but it's
not an argument
an analogy is a conversation about a
different topic that's it it's just a
different conversation
well here's my favorite fake news story
of the day
uh CNN tweeted this is what they tweeted
that the justice department declares the
seized Mar-A-Lago materials list is full
and accurate despite former president
Trump's claims of planted evidence
his claims as planted evidence
did President Trump have claims of
planted evidence
Lawrence tribe thinks so Lauren stripe
tweeted this he said
he basically is just mocking Trump for
saying that uh you know the materials
were planted
that Lawrence tribe and CNN are both
saying that Trump claims that the FBI
planted evidence to happen in the real
world
nope do you know do you know how I know
it didn't happen
I checked the fact Checkers as CNN yeah
Daniel Dale
Daniel Dale's fact Jack that's already
written right it's not I'm not talking
hypothetically the already written
opinion from Daniel Dale is that this is
fake news
CNN Zone news
now he doesn't say CNN's news is fake
news he says accurately Daniel Dale the
fact Checker is accurate when he says
that uh Trump all I'm paraphrasing but
Trump had a concern about it he had a
concern about it now is it concern that
something could have happened
similar to a claim that something
happened
it's not something no no they're not
similar those are very different things
very different things
So Daniel Dale actually has fact checked
and debunked CNN's own tweet
and they're both live right now
how many how many Democrats
would know the CNN debunked their own
news
how many would even notice
none right I'll be none I'll bet not a
single Democrat like zero out of
millions about not one person caught
that not only is it fake news but CNN
debunked it themselves
that's the world we live in I love that
story
now if it's true that the entire list of
contents is agreed upon by both sides
then that would be a pretty strong
argument that unless Trump says there's
something in there that doesn't belong
and I didn't put it there
the argument is that that you know that
suspicion can be put to rest which I
agree with if they do have a full
inventory that both sides agree with
um Josh Hawley found the uh the best way
for the Republicans to lose the midterms
and he's he's rolled it out
uh so here's a Josh Hawley tweet which
guarantees the Republicans will lose the
midterms he didn't plan this but
I think that's what's going to happen
here
so Josh Hawley says that the corruption
and abuse of law talking about the FBI
is out of control come January the new
Republican Congress must launch a
thorough public investigation of
Department of Justice and the FBI from
their targeting appearance to religious
protesters to political opponents what
Biden is doing is wrong and dangerous
now I completely agree with Josh Ali's
characterization of the Department of
Justice and the FBI do you
we could agree with that part right so
his criticism of The credibility of the
FBI and the Department of Justice I
think is right on point he gives
examples right
and I think we'd all agree with that
now do you see why he just cost the GOP
the midterms
is it obvious to you
Chuck Schumer told us
Chuck Schumer told us that Trump was
crazy
for attacking the intelligence agencies
now the FBI I'm going to treat
separately but the intelligence agencies
because Schumer said in public
in public one of our top politicians
said that our own intelligence agencies
would punish you
if you criticize them or went after them
and then they did
they did exactly what schuber said they
would do they punished him or tried to
yeah the the 50 uh people who lied about
the uh the laptop
there you go you don't have to wonder if
if Schumer was like you know just
spitballing
he said obviously this is going to
happen and then it happened and then we
confirmed it
now Josh Hawley is saying that if
Republicans win they're going to
basically dismantle the leaders of these
two organizations
what do you think the FBI
not every person you know we're all
adult enough to know that if I criticize
the FBI I'm not talking about the rank
and file employees we're fine like we're
all smart enough to know that right
we're only talking about some members of
leadership
um
although I blame them all for letting it
happen that's a separate question
anyway
why would you expect the FBI to allow
Trump to win the presidency when it
would be terrible for the FBI
now you say to yourself but they they
wouldn't do that I mean they wouldn't
interfere with the election of course
they would
you don't have to wonder if they would
interfere with an election
isn't that question answered
I mean
that's not hypothetical
we're talking about the same people who
work there right now we're not even
talking about different people in the
hypothetical situation we're talking
about the actual current people
are currently proven Beyond any doubt
that they would interfere with the
political process
so Josh Hawley basically just said if
the FBI doesn't lie and cheat and rig
the election they'll lose their jobs
and they have the power to lie and cheat
and rig an election
they did it with the laptop now not I'm
not talking about ringing the votes I'm
not talking about rigging the votes
separate I'm talking about rigging the
outcome which you can do by manipulating
public opinion right or other ways
so I think Josh Hawley created a
situation where the Republicans can't
win the midterms
because the cheating the incentive for
cheating is now off the chart
so the FBI head now has insanely High
incentive to cheat
insanely High maybe even staying at a
jail high and that's as high as you can
get staying in a jail
and do they have the capability
yes
yes they have the capability to throw an
election of course they do
and some argue that the laptop cover-up
was part of that now that was more
intelligence people but you can see the
idea right it's it's well within the
ability of some major entity to do
something like that
am I wrong that Josh Hawley just
destroyed the country
like accidentally I mean he had good
intentions
and he didn't say anything that I
disagree with
but I feel like he might have just
destroyed the entire United States
because if the FBI is forced into
throwing the election
we're going to notice
somebody's going to notice and well I've
been predicting there will not be a
civil war
I wasn't you know necessarily predicting
that the FBI would throw an election
right in front of us
but now the situation is created where
they could throw it right in front of
you and they would have an incentive to
do so
I don't know if we could avoid a Civil
War in that situation
although I think we would actually
because you know even no matter what
happens the public just doesn't have an
appetite for a civil war there's just no
appetite for that yeah the more time you
spend on
Twitter and social media and sort of the
artificial world where you know we're
all arguing our imaginary Futures and
stuff I mean we're living in sort of
this imaginary world but the actual
public now they don't care they don't
want any kind of revolution
that's not going to happen
all right but I do think we got some
trouble coming from the FBI
so let's talk about the uh the election
in Italy so this new I I guess the
winner gets to be the Prime Minister but
not necessarily
so there's some question whether the
winner will be the prime minister right
I don't know Italian system that well
but uh of course the all the folks on
the left are calling her uh the most
right-wing since Mussolini and her roots
go back to uh 20th century neo-fascist
movement and
blah blah blah
um
here's my problem
I would like to go on record
I I want to make sure nobody misses this
I do not care about the opinion of
ghosts
I know shocking but I'm going to put it
out there I don't care about the opinion
of ghosts
so if you're a great grandfather
was in the KKK
he's dead
he's dead
I'm not really going to hold that
against you
because I'm not going to base my opinion
on you
on a ghost
and when Republicans say but but but but
the KKK was created by the Democrats I
say
who are ghosts
who are ghosts
I don't care about the ghosts
um so no I don't care what her party
grew out of I don't care what the
Democrats grew out of I don't care what
the GOP grew out of I care what they are
now
and if they can't find something to
 complain about this uh Italian
Prime Minister Milani if they can't find
anything to complain about today
all they have is ghosts
now
think about it I mean I'm not joking
they're talking about the dead I mean
they're not literally ghosts but they
are talking about the thoughts of the
Dead
and how that should be important to your
opinion
I don't feel like I should pay attention
to the Dead
not really
like maybe if they wrote a book
I'll read their book
but once they're dead I really don't
care
so my take on Milani after hearing her
one speech so it's based on only one
speech that I heard and only part of it
and it was subtitled because I don't
speak Italian
and
it was the best job of persuasion I've
ever seen from a politician
now I haven't seen anybody like Winston
Churchill or Hitler or people who were
alleged to be great in their time so I
haven't really studied them
because they're dead they're dead
so I don't care but she's the best
living Persuader
politician
best living Persuader and she is a level
above Trump
in my opinion Trump was the number one
political Persuader
that I knew of I mean I don't follow
every other country but at least in the
English language Trump was the most
persuasive
best communicator
but Milani is a level above
she's she's a whole I'm not talking
about like 10 percent better than Trump
I'm talking about you wouldn't put them
in the same league
and Trump was the best in the world
she's crazy she's crazy she's so good
and you know part of it is the
presentation
now here's here's the dumbest thing that
anybody said about this and Hillary
Clinton is of course a purveyor of this
the dumbest thing that anybody can say
about this particular politician
is wow a woman won this High office
now that was impressive
until I heard her
and then the woman thing just disappears
because here's my statement anybody who
could do what what Milani would do would
be the head of any country
male or female or trans I'll throw in
trans
she could have won as a a trans person
and I'm not joking about that
the whole woman thing is a complete red
herring
uh wrong word but it was a complete
distraction from something that's way
more important than that
it doesn't matter what genitalia this
person had you can drag out any kind of
genital you you want put it behind the
lectern and say these words with this
presentation I'm there like I'm I'm sold
the this is just pure skill
and as soon as you make this about man
woman
like you really just off on the wrong
trail
all right if I'm if a man had run
against the woman and the man said this
the man would have won this was just a
winning
level of skill now let me tell you what
she did better
here's what uh Trump does
Trump does uh my team against your team
and and immigrants are or you know
illegal immigrants you know maybe bad
so sort of uh us against you sort of
thing
and
um you immediately just you immediately
just Retreat to your team so Trump's
message is one that doesn't really
convince the other side would you agree
it's a message for the base agree
it's a message for the base
which works if you can get the base to
vote
here's what Milani did and it may be
because their politics are more
fractured she has to do it differently
she talked about her right
of freedom
and that she wanted to be freedom to be
a woman
and call herself a woman
freedom to be
uh what else freedom to be a mother
and to be called a mother
freedom to be a believer a religious
believer to not be criticized for it and
freedom to be a patriot for her own
country
wow
wow that is so so good
because everybody agrees with wait a
minute you know maybe I'm not Christian
but are we really talking about you
can't even be one
right because even the people who
disagree with her are like oh
well we didn't mean to take away your
basic freedom
you know we have political differences
but you're actually going right down to
the heart of can I be me
is it legal to be me
that is so strong
because I I could just feel it I could
just feel her I could feel the weight of
Oppression
and I could feel her being done with it
so I got both of those
the weight of Oppression which I never
really thought about before
I never really thought about how as a
conservative in this country but in her
country more that she's being vilified
for her identity
really it's not even their opinion it's
their identity
and so she's basically making the left's
argument
stronger than the left
what's that called
what's that called
you're making the other person's
argument stronger than they are
Embrace and amplify
who does that
who does that Embrace and amplify only
the best
the best right you can't even pull that
off unless you've got a pretty big skill
level for persuasion
because embracing the other side is a
dangerous thing unless you could really
slay it at the same time you're
embracing it and she did
so she embraced personal freedom and
identity
and said I'm going to extend this not
only is personal freedom important like
you believe
but it's even more important than you
believe
I believe what you believe in even
stronger than you believe in
so let's be consistent here huh
unfreakin believable the level of talent
that I saw in just that little clip now
again I only saw the little clip maybe
she had a good day
but I don't think so because she won the
election so obviously whatever she's
saying is
is hitting the right courts
uh did I just zoom no no I did not
advise her in case you're wondering
all right
um
and does it it seems to me that in this
country so Italy is doing pretty good
with their leader there but in this
country have you noticed that the
standards that we used to set for what a
good communicator was used to be a
little higher
do you remember Reagan
even if he didn't like his politics
you'd say oh I don't like his politics
but gotta admit
God admit that guy can communicate right
Bill Clinton same thing
don't like his politics but wow that guy
can put a sentence together can he
how about Obama
Obama you might not like his politics
but wow that guy can that guy can form a
sentence speak intelligently communicate
he's got it fast enough how about Trump
some people have first resisted his his
style
but at this point I think even his
critics would say yeah we we hate what
he says but I have to admit he's really
good at saying it he's very persuasive
and now we have uh
fetterman and Biden two of the
the biggest names in politics
Biden can barely walk to his helicopter
unaided and fetterman have you seen the
latest clip
or what did he say uh the Eagles
were worse than
the Eagles
I mean you have to actually see the clip
to see he's completely lost like his his
mind as
it appears I'm no doctor right so I
can't diagnose him but it would appear
that his mind is not working in anything
like what you would want a normal mind
to work
for somebody that you're going to hire
for an important job
but here's the funniest part
I cannot stop laughing
at what it must feel like
to be Dr Oz
imagine watching this guy talk
and you're sitting at home and you're
behind in the polls to him
what what does that feel like
I can't imagine anything that would hurt
more than that
the the only thing that would hurt more
than that would be Trump sitting at
Mar-A-Lago watching Biden try to form
full sentences and watching the entire
country crumble and saying
I lost to that
I lost to that
but I feel like Oz has it even worse
because with Biden you could at least
say well
we don't you know we didn't know what
was going to happen until he got elected
we had bad suspicions and you know it
went pretty badly according to a lot of
people
uh but with Oz he's just got to look at
this guy and we're all looking at the
same stuff
yeah
you know that things are only judged in
relationship to other things right
there's nothing in the world nothing in
reality that can be judged just sitting
there in space it can only be judged and
how it affects other things or how it
compares to other things so nothing has
a quality
that it just owns by itself it's just
compared to other things
so Oz is finding out for the first time
what compares to him and looks to other
people like a little bit better a little
bit better
[Music]
to me the political part of the story is
is mildly interesting but the personal
part of this is freaking hilarious to me
like every time I think of Oz looking at
fetterman I think
that's got to be a bad night that's just
got to be bad
all right uh
have you noticed that Democrats at least
when they're arguing with you on Twitter
are asking you to prove the obvious
more and more
so here are some things
that that I've been challenged to prove
name one thing that Joe Biden seems to
have been done that looks illegal
what
what
uh Ukraine
uh just to you know get the ball rolling
here's another one of it I've been
challenged to prove
how are conservatives being robbed of
their freedom of speech
where's that happening can you prove
that conservatives are being
like limited in their speech to which I
say
you haven't noticed
nothing
you haven't you haven't noticed that
they were
I'm not going to research that
I'm really not
how about uh when I was asked this week
to prove my claim that a equally
qualified black man would have a five
times Advantage getting hired at a at a
major organization not a small company
but a big organization compared to a
adult white male
and I was asked to prove that black men
who are equally qualified have an
advantage in Corporate America
or in any large organization in America
to which I say
really
that's an there's so many questions
if you want to research it literally
walk outside and just tap on the
shoulder of the first White adult you
see over the age of 40. just anybody
and they will tell you a story of it
happening to them or their friend
everyone you can't find a person who
can't prove that to you I'm not going to
prove it to you
like I'm not going to prove that oxygen
exists
like sure I don't have any proof but I'm
not going to research it I'm not going
to research that for you I'm sorry
and then I've been asked to prove that
conservatives are being targeted and or
Hunted
what
again do I really need to prove that
you haven't noticed
nothing nothing in the news
so it's the weirdest thing uh
so like half of all my interactions with
the left are then demanding that I
approve something that is right in front
of them
doesn't require any proof at all
right
um
God the news is so good today
I have been hearing that the Democrats
are getting serious about replacing
Biden for running for president for
2024. the name that comes up the most
for replacing Biden is John fetterman
John Federman
I'll just leave that there for a moment
yeah yes it's a joke
yeah I love the fact that you couldn't
tell if it was a joke
I love the fact
that the first thing I was asked is are
you kidding
that was the first and by the way that
wasn't a bad question I'm not mocking
the question we do live in a world
where the the the insane Ridiculousness
of that statement that Biden could be
replaced with fetterman
actually was possible
you couldn't rule it out could you yeah
right I got you
all I had to do is say it with a
straight face and you were willing to
accept that well maybe
Maybe
all right we gotcha
uh
uh all right so did you all see the
video of this this one you have to see
uh I tweeted it you can find it anywhere
on Twitter but Jeremy Raskin
um talking to Thomas Massey about
January 6 and raps now you have to see
it because you know Thomas Massey is
simply asking for
some explanation of the raps involvement
and whether or not there's any evidence
that he was part of an FBI incitement
now you have to see Jeremy raskin's uh
Angry response
in which he said things such as oh and
so Thomas Massey asked if they could
release release the transcripts of the
ray apps interview
and here's here's a completely normal
response to somebody saying could you
release the transcript that's important
to the nation
what would be a perfectly reasonable
answer to that
well a reasonable answer would be
something like oh we plan to release
that
you know just give us the state and
we'll release it perfectly reasonable
right
or we're not going to release any of
them
okay
you know I mean I'd look for a reason
but that would sound at least like oh
okay there might be a reason maybe
privacy whatever
um or how about he said well we can't
release him because of privacy
but if some specific Republicans you
know want to sign an NDA whatever you
need to do
we'll show some Republicans just so
there's transparency
but we'd ask you not to share it with
the public but just agree that there's
nothing here once you've looked at it
now that would be pretty reasonable
wouldn't it so there were many
reasonable ways
that Jeremy Raskin could have answered
the a public request you know in front
of people
can we see the transcript
so which of those ways did Jeremy Raskin
choose
let me give you my impression
there were thousands of interviews there
were thousands of interviews we haven't
really said there were thousands of
interviews and leave this you know Ray
Epps schmuck alone
um
you no longer have to wonder if there's
something up
you don't
yeah you I give you permission you don't
need my permission but sometimes it
helps
you should
believe what they're telling you
now communication has
at least two forms wouldn't you say you
can communicate with your words and you
can communicate with your body let me
give you example
let me let me uh tell you that I like
you but my body will say I don't
I like you
I really like you oh
now did I say I liked you
or would you say you have conclusively
communicated to us that you don't like
that you don't like which one do you
believe the unambiguous body language
or the words that you know are often
lies
now Raskin has communicated to the
public in unambiguous unambiguous body
language and choice of words this is
unambiguous
right so you are free to accept that as
a confirmation
and if you don't
and you still you still act like there's
some information we need
there's no information you need that's
everything you needed right there
because if that doesn't confirm that Ray
Epps had something to do with the FBI in
a way that you don't want to know about
it it definitely confirms there was
something that they don't want you to
know
same story I don't care what it is that
they don't want me to know
do you
if they're lying to you you get to
assume that it's all a lie
is there uh is there a judge here
I'll bet there's somebody watching who's
a working or retired judge
fair or not if you know they're lying
you get to assume the rest is a lie
that's pretty basic American
way to proceed right
pretty much so why are we still asking
the question when we've been given the
answer in the clearest possible way
the clearest possible answer is don't
ask us about Ray apps that's all you
need to know
we're done here
and by the way Thomas Massey is doing a
great job
pushing this thing because I don't even
care if there's nothing there
you know if it turns out the ray-ups is
just some poor schmuck who's trying to
survive as Jeremy Raskin says
I don't even care
because if they're lying about it you
have to assume all the rest is a lie
it's just a reasonable explanation so I
think I think the Republicans should
just say Jeremy Raskin confirmed
that the FBI and rayaps were working
together
and he confirmed it by his reaction you
don't need to ask me any more questions
about that
just go look yourself if that doesn't
look like a confirmation to you
um that would be your opinion but to me
that looks pretty clear
yeah so
um this is just wonderful
all right
uh and here's what Raskin changed the
subject to
so first saying but there are thousands
of interviews and then he's just some
Porsche muck he immediately changes it
to an angry tirade about what Trump has
done to his own family
according to the Mary Trump book
well look what Trump has done to his own
family according to the Mary trunk book
now is that the answer you expected from
would it be possible for us to see the
transcript
of rayapse's testimony
the most natural answer to that is have
you seen the Mary Trump book have you
seen the Mary Trump book and saying the
bad things about the Trump family
that's exactly the most obvious answer
to can we see the ray Epps transcript
I'm telling you
Jeremy Raskin has confirmed the FBI and
Democrat involvement with rayaps to do
something bad
this is reason to Pardon everybody who
is non-violent who's being held and
everybody who's been convicted they all
need to be pardoned
right if
I don't think that you can turn anybody
into a single issue voter these days
but if you wanted to pick a single issue
we have a bunch of them this time
one single issue
would be this I I would vote potentially
I would vote for a candidate who said
unambiguously the FBI is stonewalling us
so I'm going to I'm just going to
let everybody out of jail if you elect
me
I would say that would be a adequate
supportable single issue vote
likewise I would say on the Democrat
side if they decided to vote only
because of abortion
and again I'm not giving you my opinion
on abortion I'm just describing the
landscape here if they decided to do
that I would say that would be
justifiable
because the the size of the issue is big
enough you can make an argument for that
I mean it wouldn't be what I would do
but you can understand it
the other one is fentanyl
if if one of the two parties came up
with a fentanyl plan that actually
looked like it could work
that would be a single issue vote for me
yeah some people would say climate
change I would agree yeah that could be
a single issue too but this is kind of
interesting normally the economy is the
only single issue vote isn't it
and maybe it's the only one that ever
will be because if you get the economy
working every everything else seems to
work better
so free speech here
yeah Second Amendment I guess it's all
single issue isn't it it seems like it's
all signal issued now
all right
um and the funniest thing that Jeremy
Raskin said about rayups is was uh leave
every leave that guy alone whoever he is
Jeremy Raskin acted like
he whoever he is
like he wasn't quite sure who rayapse
was
are we done
[Laughter]
[Music]
are there any further questions about
whether they're live
all right
um
let me tell you something that I learned
from a meth addict
and one of the questions I had is why is
it so hard to get people to quit drugs
and like if you had a plan to decrease
demand how could you do it
and let me explain something that I'd
never heard before
but
it's kind of important
and the explanation was this
that meth users are not
strictly addicted to the math
it is most typically combined with at
least one other thing
sex
and porn
support and sex
and here's the problem
as described to me
porn insects under the influence of math
is about 60 times more enjoyable than
without it
and if you've done meth long enough you
know that if you were to try to have sex
ever again without meth you wouldn't
even enjoy it
because you would know what it could
have been
and so when you say to somebody hey can
I help you get off meth you're actually
asking them to give up sex forever and
the sex that you're asking them to give
up is 60 times more powerful than the
ones you know about
would you give up your sex
to give up drugs
I don't know anybody who would
now suppose I told you that you don't
even know how good sex is
because you don't you don't even know
sex under meth
is not like regular sex it's 60 times
more powerful according to the Dare
police officer who told me I mean I got
it from the police a guy who taught a
drug
you know drug stuff to parents so this
is from a professional who said that the
reason they do the meth is that the meth
itself is 60 times better than sex but
when they combined the meth the 60 times
better than an orgasm with actual sex
what they get is neither sex nor meth
and here's the part that you don't
understand
you can't tell you can't ask somebody to
quit something that's 60 times stronger
than sex
that's not a thing no no person will do
that
so there is no path off of math unless
you give up everything that you enjoy
about life
that's it now I do think that people
quit I mean that's a real thing but
whatever it is that they're quitting for
must be pretty important or they hit
bottom and they couldn't get enjoyment
from the meth anymore because you hit
bottom things were so bad that you just
can't make anything work
so
if you have if you have thoughts about
reducing demand
it would pay to get more let's say
informed and I would say that that was a
big one for me
like learning that the the sex meth
thing are really the same thing and then
if you're a meth addict you don't even
see them as different things
they're basically one big thing
you can't get anybody off those drugs
not not in any volume I mean you could
do ones and twosies because you have
special cases
that's it
so when people say you know there's
nothing you can do on the supply side
you have to work on the demand side
I say to you there are two
impossibilities
you can't do either one
can't do either one
so
if we could experiment and find
something that works that'd be great but
nobody has any ideas
you picked a bad time to quit meth
um
is that why the Hollywood people seem to
be perverts
uh partly partly yeah the the more the
more of that kind of drug you do the
more likely you would get into uh the
fringer
practices
which I do not
which I do not uh
what should I say I don't disrespect
because I you know it's not my business
how you get your fun if it's not hurting
anybody
all right uh
your bandmate became a month and became
a monk
and lived in isolation for two years to
get off meth
and when the monk was done
was he glad he did it
I don't know I didn't hear the part
about the happy ending
I just heard he did it
all right
so I don't want to I don't want to act
like there's no solution what I do want
you to know is that nobody knows of one
nobody knows of one
everybody's sure somebody else has a
solution for getting people off of drugs
I don't believe there is one I don't
believe there is maybe we can invent one
but I don't think there is one now
um
oh why do the Democrats seem to dominate
our culture and our legal system Etc I
think that has to do with
colleges and professors and the news
business and where they come from so it
has to do with what types of people go
into what types of jobs and so the
people going into the entertainment
field tend to be left leaning
and the people who go into I don't know
in many cases blue collar work would be
right leaning
if I can use a gross over generalization
and I think I can
all right well I believe we have
accomplished our objective of the best
live stream of all time
am I right
and thank you to jack posabic for I
forgot to mention for informing me about
a little bit more about the uh Chinese
system and Naomi Wu as well who informed
me about what's going on there via tweet
in her case
all right
um
and would you agree that there will be
nothing on television today
as interesting
or as informative or as useful
as today
no this was the best thing that ever
happened
and I would like to say goodbye to
YouTube for now
and I'll talk to you later
