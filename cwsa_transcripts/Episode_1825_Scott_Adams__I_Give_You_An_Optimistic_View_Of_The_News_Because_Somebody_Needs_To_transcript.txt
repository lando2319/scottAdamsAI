good morning everybody
and welcome
to the best experience of the day
best experience of the month the year
indeed your very life
since the history of the universe
there's never been a finer moment than
this and tomorrow is looking good too
if you'd like to take today up to a
level heretofore unheard of
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
to take your chalice to stein a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better from california to pennsylvania
it's called the simultaneous sip
go
divine
lord
well
it would appear that uh maybe my notes
didn't all pit
print out but uh huh
that's interesting
looks like my notes didn't fully print
but that doesn't matter because i have a
backup
so uh
marvel has a new uh
movie out
have you heard the trend toward uh
making movies more awoke has anybody
mentioned to you
that that might be a trend
and
do you ever think to yourself i think
i'll know when this trend has gone too
far
you'd be able to spot it when it happens
right
like you always think it's going too far
but when the trend really goes too far
you all know it
well marvel is advertising their new
movie i swear to god i'm not making this
up
honest
to god
this is real
marvel's new movie is called she-hulk
about a woman
who's a lawyer
she's not just she's not just a
stay-at-home mom she's a lawyer
and she gets a little the hulk's blood
in her and she turns into a she-hulk
now
is it over
are we done
[Laughter]
is there anything that could be more
ridiculous than she-hulk
and here's the funny thing i'll probably
watch it
i'll probably watch it for like half an
hour
and the advertisements show it's like
they're talking about how
it's such an innovative
breakout concept
and i thought to myself
what is innovative and
you know special about exactly what
every every movie is doing
all they're doing is taking the male
characters and turning them into female
but when you turn the hulk
into the she-hulk
am i alone in thinking that maybe you've
hit the limit of how much wokeness you
can
cram into one civilization
feels like somebody says it's not a new
character now i don't care if it's not a
new character
it's a new movie right so the fact that
it was a character that existed and
never heard of
doesn't really change the story
there's not much to say about it just
that there's going to be a she-hulk
so you know that companies are getting
this thing called an esg
score to show how woke they are i guess
what is the e is environment
s is for
social
uh justice
and the g is for
some kind of good governance or
something something like that
basically it's a catch-all for wokeness
and i guess corporations are getting a
score
you know tesla is somewhere in the
middle
they're not quite woke enough
um etc
but uh i was wondering if that's
complete enough it doesn't seem complete
i feel like what you need is not just a
woke uh
an esg woke this score
but for investors purposes don't you
need a crippled by wokeness score
so i was suggesting that
yeah you know for environmental purposes
and
for social purposes you may you might
want to know their esg score
but suppose you were just a cold hearted
investor
wouldn't you want to know
which companies to avoid
you'd want to know which companies to
avoid right
so i suggested that there should be also
a
crippled by wokeness score
then i noticed that senator tom cotton
had responded to my tweet
saying that my idea for a crippled by
wokeness score would basically be the
same thing as the esg score is now so
that's a little redundant
to which i
thought huh
all right you want me you want me to
really things up
uh
what kind of companies should you invest
in
the companies with the highest esg
scores are the lowest go
if you were as an investor
do you want the lowest esg score meaning
the least woke
or the most woke
i'm going to argue first investment
the medium
medium would be worse here's why
the only way you could be the most woke
is if you're the most rich
you would have to be super successful to
be so woke that you thought you could
afford it
right
so at the highest highest lowness you're
probably also going to find the company
that's producing the most cash
not always yeah i mean we're talking
about generalities here right if you're
going to invest in stocks don't invest
in specific companies
you know do baskets of companies
but i would speculate that the companies
had the highest esg scores are the ones
that think they can afford the luxury
because it's a luxury expense
so i would say that the most profitable
ones would have it but then also the
least profitable ones the one the ones
that are you know just tying their own
shoelaces you know together
so
i don't know
you could play this a couple of
different ways i'm not sure i have a
firm opinion which way that that would
go but wouldn't you love to know
wouldn't you love to see an index fund
of low esg companies
come on
you could get rid of the esg thing
if you just put together an index fund
of the lower ones and find out how they
do compare to the higher ones
it's over
i think
the trouble is that you might find that
effect i just mentioned
that the more profitable you are
the more excess you can afford so you
might find actually that the most
profitable companies that have the best
esg scores
but not because of it
would be because they can afford it
all right
how about ufos
so uh tucker in his uh
in his other show he's got a i think a
streaming show i forget what it's called
but he interviewed dr gary nolan
uh i guess the show is just called
tucker carlson the streaming version
and dr gary dolan is a a serious
credentialed scientist
he's got some stanford credentials and
so he's like a serious serious scientist
and he was saying that they're doing
actual studies
because there's evidence that people who
have had any kind of contact with a ufo
are likely to have brain damage
people
they have abnormal brains
so people who have had
close contact including in one case
allegedly
touching one on the ground
that's right
if you didn't know about this there's a
famous case of somebody who walked right
up and touched it
have you seen the pictures
oh oh yeah they there weren't any
pictures
but at least you could get it com
confirmed by the other eyewitnesses oh i
don't think there were any other
eyewitnesses
but that's totally something that
happened
so i ask you this
dr gary nolan is not
does not um i don't think he asserts a
belief in alien encounters
so we're not talking about that
so when we talk about ufos we really
mean just unidentified
so to be fair to dr dolan
he's he's not he's not telling us the
answer he's saying there's a mystery
here he's trying to figure it out he's
got some machine that in fact
has has determined that the brains of
people or at least their blood to have
some kind of abnormality i think
and that the people who claim to have
contact with ufos have
different brains
now how do you explain this
could it be that people who see ufos
come in contact with something that
warps their brains
there's one possibility that's being
considered
the other possibility is that the way
that you see a ufo is to having an
abnormal brain in the first place
who is it who sees things that are not
in existence
what kind of brain sees things that are
not there
well
joe biden would be one kind but
generally speaking it would be brains
that are abnormal
so if you knew that people who have
abnormal brains are associated with
people who
claim they saw
possible alien spaceships
wouldn't you sort of think maybe
maybe cause and effect got reversed
there a little bit a little bit
or is it possible that these anecdotal
reports do not form a randomized
controlled trial the gold standard of
science
here's what i think it is
i think if a lot of people report that
they saw ufos
some number of them will also have
abnormal brains
and
it just looks to me like anecdotal stuff
to me
confirmation bias anecdote accident i
don't see anything there frankly
well what do you think are the states
that people most want to go live in
uh rasmussen did a little poll and found
out where people would most likely live
if they're already in the united states
you would not be surprised
florida is number one
has florida done a great job of
marketing itself or what
whatever you want to say about florida
let's say you're a democrat and you say
does anta s
this
all those
mistakes you're making
um but the one thing you can't deny is
if you do a survey and there are more
people who want to
move into desantis's state than out
he must be doing something right
more people want to go there than don't
i mean at least it's the number one
state they want to go to
18 percent of americans would rather
live in florida if they could move
but 11
this is number two on the list would
move to california
so the two places the number one and two
places that people would like to move to
uh the best place in the country and the
shittiest place
makes sense
i'd like to move to the best place and
the shittiest place
well it might have to do with the fact
that people have different preferences
and different information and all that
frankly
i don't think i can move i could live in
florida all year round
i could definitely
visit
in the right season
but there's no way i can live in florida
year round i don't know how anybody does
that
but living in california where i live
anyway year round very easy
very easy i live in one of the very few
places you could have
one home
and all year long you can say yeah
pretty i'm pretty glad i live here
it's very rare
why is another place like that
how in the world is hawaii not on the
list
hawaii has i think the happiest people
but it didn't make the top three um but
here's the funny part
um
the fourth on the list so new york is
number three fourth on the list is
pennsylvania
how did little
scrappy pennsylvania get on the list
number four
what exactly is it about pennsylvania
that sold it above
wyoming and
maryland and
what what exactly old
trains well my speculation is
there's something in pennsylvania
very valuable
the liberty bell maybe it's the liberty
belt
um or maybe not
well in uh kansas uh apparently there
was a big turnout
on the vote uh i guess just a few days
ago
in which uh
kansas can
what's the name for people who live in
kansas
the tanzanians right
kansas
kins indians
the the kins and indians
voted overwhelmingly i guess
decisively i'll say not overwhelmingly
i'll say decisively
to keep abortion rights in their
constitution
now my understanding is that there's
already movement
to pay people to get abortions out of
state
and i guess biden is going to sign an
executive order
to allow medicare to cover you no matter
what state you get your treatment in so
you can go to another state and still be
covered i feel like that's the big
adjustment that's going to happen
i feel like that's the big adjustment
um how many states do you think will
be banning abortions when it's all said
and done and the states get to work
through their individual decisions what
do you think how many states do you
think will ban
you say you think 25
i think the number is going to be
smaller than you think
that's what i think i think whatever you
estimate it might be half of that
and the reason is it's kind of hard to
be a competitive state
yeah
imagine if you were in a family
and you knew there was exactly only one
person who might ever get pregnant in
your whole family let's say there's only
one female
your daughter your sister or something
like that there's just one female in
your whole family
who could even get pregnant
because they're the right age and
right gender
if that one person was at risk of maybe
moving out of your state
and you didn't really have an opinion
about abortion one way or another
i feel like i feel like maybe you would
get a lot of people who are not in the
fight
wanting their relatives not to have to
move
so i i've got a feeling that
i've got a feeling that
a
few states will ban abortions completely
so that's my prediction
now i'm not i'm not saying that's what i
want or you know because i don't get
into the question of what should be the
law about abortion
as i've told you too many times i would
rather recuse myself
unless something changes and i can start
having babies
the moment i can have a baby you're
gonna hear my opinion like you've
you've never imagined
but until i can i'd rather you know
defer to people who have more more skin
in the game
all right
um here's the permanent news ukrainians
are still
holding strong against russian forces
how many of you thought that the
russians would have already started
pushing the ukrainians back
and that russia was going to take a
little more time to do it
but they would just chew away on ukraine
until there was nothing left
how many thought that was going to
happen you know remember my my
prediction was that ukraine would stall
russia and russia would regret it
it's somewhere in the middle because it
looks like russia got a whole bunch of
really good strategic stuff they'll
probably be able to hold it
so i can't say that i was completely
right
but
i was directionally interestingly close
to right because ukraine is is resisting
way better than people thought
so i think i was on the tiny
tiny people group of people who
predicted ukraine would do better than
people expected
and that was based on technology
you know military technology
what is funnier than joe biden claiming
credit for the lowered gas prices
let me ask you you you all watch the
news
you're well educated consumers of news
can you tell me in the comments
if your news sources have informed you
about one of the most important stories
happening the price of gas
what is the reason the price of the
price of gas has been going down
fairly
significantly
and for a while now i get that it's
still way higher than it needs to be
that's a separate conversation but the
trend is lower
tell me in the comments because you all
read the news
why that's happening
and i'm not going to read your messages
yet
look how many people say they don't know
but most people are saying low demand
some people are saying because biden
released the emergency reserves
uh less driving because the gas
yeah um it looks like the reason is
lower demand
so joe biden managed to get the gas
prices so high
that people didn't want to buy as much
so the price came down a little bit
hey
you locals people what are you doing
over there
all right
so
somehow
this has turned into a dilbert comic let
me describe this as a dilbert comic
right here's what's literally happening
biden did something
and some things in quote so he did
something about the problem
that's all you have to do this is pure
dilbert comic strip
pointy-haired boss strategy
you do something anything you reorganize
you change the name of something you say
your focus is different and then you
wait
you wait for something that was going to
happen on its own
oh looks like things are going in the
right direction now it's a good thing i
reorganized changed the department names
changed my focus
right and then you take credit
so the number one thing that i make fun
of in the dilbert comic but maybe if you
could say there's one thing
it's managers doing random things
and then trying to sell it as the reason
is something that was basically luck or
chance or was going to happen anyway
happened am i right
if you read the comic that's that's
probably one of my biggest themes
is management taking credit for things
that were going to happen on their own
and here's biden he does that he does
the pointy hair boss moves and it works
it works on democrats because apparently
they don't understand anything about
business or economics or anything
apparently i mean it looks that way
so he does this emergency petroleum
reserve thing and what do all the
experts say about the emergency
uh you know oil reserve
they all say the same thing
they all say well yeah that could make a
little bit of difference
but it also costs you your entire
emergency oil reserve
it's like there's a little bit of
difference
so
so biden cleverly he's making this work
by the way
so if it sounds like a criticism i'm not
sure it is
in a political context it's kind of
clever he did something that makes no
difference at all or a tiny difference
he just waits until demand itself is
going to go down after the summer at the
very least demand was going to go down
after the summer
so if you do the petroleum reserves at
the right time
you can claim that the natural reduction
in demand after the summer was actually
because your
strategic petroleums are reserved
lowering the cost
what would desantis do
you would
look for all sources of
energy all right so biden actually
pulled the pointy haired boss move and
got away with it
he's totally pulling it off
all right
did all of you see the
video of alex jones uh on
the witness stand for his uh sandy hook
trial
you really have to watch that
i i don't think i've ever seen a
a perry
perry mason trial moment you know the
perry mason is like a very old
lawyer tv show where he was always doing
a gotcha i gotcha
on the witness stand
but here's what it looks like what
happened um i have a little skepticism
that the way it's being described is
what is what really happened
i think we're going to find out that
what we think happened isn't exactly
what happened
but here's what is alleged to have
happened
it looked like
alex jones was on
the stand he was answering for his sandy
hook
so-called conspiracy theories which he's
admitted were not true at this point he
actually said he thought he had some
kind of form of psychosis that caused
him to believe the conspiracy theory
so even even alex jones is saying that
the thing he said was true
which was that the sandy hook thing was
fake and it was actors
was not true
and that
he says there was something wrong with
his mind that he thought it was true
and
that's a pretty strong defense
it's kind of a strong defense that you
thought it was true
um and who who exactly is going to look
at alex jones's entire
body of work
and say that
that it it's definitely not true that
that he had some kind of psychosis
do you think anybody do you think a jury
could look at him and say yeah we're
gonna we're gonna totally rule out some
kind of psychosis
because it looks like it could be right
and part of what makes him so damn
interesting is you don't know what's
going to happen and he looks crazy
but he looks crazy in a way that you're
not quite sure
maybe he's crazy smart
maybe the crazy people are right
right so
um you know if i were a juror and you
and you gave this defense my defenses
assuming there was no other evidence
right well there will be other evidence
but if the only thing you heard was
uh your defenses that he had a form of
psychosis i would look at his videos and
go yeah maybe
i can't rule it out
um so anyway here's the the story uh
allegedly
the plaintiff's lawyer if i'm using the
right term there so the lawyer on the
other side
has uh alex jones on the jury stand and
then tells alex
for the first time
and this is the amazing part of the
story
alex jones is hearing this
for the first time
that alex jones's lawyer accidentally
gave the entire contents of alex jones's
phone
to the other side
without making them agree to i don't not
use parts of it or whatever so i guess
because of a legal legal technicality
on top of what might have been just a
lawyer mistake
maybe with the technology maybe
something else
that the lawyer had the entire contents
of alex jones
text messages on the topic of
sandy hook
and was telling alex jones that
the things alex jones was testifying to
would be perjury according to what
they've seen on the text messages
now
here is my question
right without telling alex jones because
apparently it was a mistake
apparently it was a mistake
to give that information but once it was
given the other side can see it because
it was given to them without a an
agreed-upon restriction
if i'm getting the legal parts right
now
alex jones seemed to be
surprised that that happened
and maybe a little worried wouldn't you
ima imagine the entire contents of your
phone
being available to somebody who wants
you dead
basically you know the sandy hook uh
people who were prosecuted the people
are suing him
yeah i'm exaggerating a little bit but
they probably want that guy dead i mean
they just probably hate him with a hate
that i can't even imagine
and they they have all the contents of
his phone
or at least the lawyer does
now here's the question
the the judge allowed this conversation
to happen
where the
the attorney was making accusations as
opposed to asking questions of alex
jones
i believe they're allowed to ask
questions but they're not supposed to be
introducing a lot of evidence right
should should a lawyer be introducing
brand new evidence
while the accused is on the stand
that feels like the opposite of the
trial
now my understanding is that there might
be an exception for perjury
the perjury might be the one time you
could say ha ha
but i know you're lying because of x is
that true
so i mean i don't know exactly
what the what the legal
um
you know guardrails are what you can and
cannot do but let me tell you just as a
citizen
so just as a citizen watching this
the moment i found out that
the attorney on the other side
through an accident a mistake
had all of this information and now
could use it any way they wanted
i would have thrown out the case if i
had been the judge i would have said
okay
whatever this is is not justice
it's maybe you know maybe it was a an
honest accident
but you can't have the trial now you
can't have a you can't have an honest
trial now that this has happened the
rules that keep us all safe
uh are still intact but there's
something
you know a weird situation that
that caused them to be violated in a
conceptual way maybe not a technical way
and not only that but i think it would
have jailed both the of the attorneys
if i were the judge i would have put the
pros you know the the plaintiff and the
defense attorneys i would put them both
in jail
until i figured out what the went
on
am i wrong
i would have stopped the trial at that
moment and said wait are you are you
honestly saying
is the allegation that i'm just learning
right now in live trial are you
seriously telling me that you have the
entire contents of the of the
defendant's phone
and that they did not intend to give it
to you and that you you intend to use it
because of a technicality is that why is
that what i'm hearing
and then suppose they said yes that's
exactly what you're hearing
i would have put both of them in jail
now i wouldn't keep them there
but i'd say you know whatever you've
done is so bad there's got to be some
 crime to this
you guys go working out you know maybe
half a day in jail or something but
somehow i think the attorneys need to be
in jail like actually behind bars
even if it's just for an hour
like just one hour but i feel like
there's like a there's some kind of
principle or point
that has to be
protected here
right
so
i don't know
does anybody know enough about yeah i
haven't heard what dershowitz said i'm
not sure
i'm not sure
that's exactly his
his uh
domain well i guess it would be because
it's constitutional maybe
uh uh the rule's the same for a civil
trial what that's what i don't know yeah
so so that's exactly the kind of thing i
don't know civil trial versus criminal
trial
um if it's perjury is the t is that an
exception
but don't you have um check robert
barnes twitter feed yeah i will check
that i will robert barnes would be
an excellent follow for you by the way
if you're not following robert barnes
you should
i can't remember the last time i saw a
tweet from him i'm definitely being
that's weird i have to go i can't think
of the last time i saw a tweet from
robert barnes i'm sure i've been
following him forever
what's up with that
all right
um
so here's what i'd like to add to this
alex jones situation so alex jones is
being sued
and generally speaking without getting
into the full details he's being accused
of making up a story that isn't true
about the sandy hook thing being fake
when it was actually a horrible tragedy
and that by saying it was fake to so
many people in such a public way it
caused the parents of the sandy hook
thing to have just horrible problems
which i can imagine they're pretty
horrible they had death threats they
needed all kinds of stuff
so they're suing it
but here's my problem what exactly is
the difference between what alex jones
did making up a story that hurt specific
people that's what he's being accused of
and what joe biden did to win the
presidency
joe biden
promoted the fine people
hoax
and it wanted the presidency the fine
people hoax
identifies a set of people and demonizes
them
um
and he used that to get elected now not
only did he use the fine people hoax he
used the russia collusion hoax to
demonize people made up story and the
insurrection oaks another made up story
to demonize people
your the president of the united states
is doing exactly the same crime if it's
a crime or it's an effect not a crime
but i guess would be an offense
what would it what's it called if it's a
if it's a civil trial it's not a crime
it's a
it's a
tort i don't know any of my legal stuff
it's a civil action i don't know
whatever it is
but
tell me i'm wrong
tell me i'm wrong i say joe biden has
committed exactly the same offense
uh you know different topics but it's
the same offense
at least three times
at least three times in public
at least three times
now i'm not talking about when
biden goes after trump
when biden goes after trump alone
that's politics that's not illegal
right even if he lies
not legal but
if
biden starts dragging in trump's
supporters which is exactly what he does
right not
not conceptually not a little bit not
slightly exactly what he does he brings
the he brings the the base
into the conversations very directly
right i'm not i'm not inferring
he does it directly in in specific words
how is that not what alex jones is doing
being accused of
seriously is there even one person who
disagrees with my
representation of this
if you're lying to demonize a group of
specific americans
specific
americans that's pretty bad
is it true or false that uh joe biden
has
said that everybody who attended the
fine people
situation the charlottesville thing has
he not said that all of them are racist
white supremacist
he has
yes are there not
do we not have uh
well i have proof
i i've personally interviewed people who
attended
who racist but
they disavowed the racists but they
thought just as a matter of principle or
history or whatever they would prefer
keeping the statues
now do you think that every one of those
people who is definitely not a racist
but has a different opinion about how to
represent history
don't you think they have a case against
joe biden probably not because he's
political right
i don't believe you can sue the
president
can can you give me a fact check on that
i don't believe you can sue the
president for
the same thing that uh alex jones is
being accused of but it's the same crime
and oh paula jones did did she
or did they make that
bill clinton got sued
but that was criminal
is that different
yeah maybe you could huh
so is it the department of justice that
usually doesn't want to prosecute a
sitting president
unless they really really have to
yeah i guess i don't know the standard
there so ignore everything i said
as usual as usual
well
if if you heard that there had been some
kind of an election
in arizona what would be the county in
arizona you'd be most concerned
had a
rapid and very incredible
count of the vote
what would be the county you'd most be
concerned about before it even happened
yep a little place called maricopa
a an election did happen allegedly
in arizona
and
what do you think is the county that's
having the most trouble counting the
votes
and it's taken a while
maricopa maricopa
can somebody give me a
fact check is it true that france
stopped using
electronic counting machines and mail-in
ballots because there's no way to secure
them
i saw that on the internet but is that
actually true
i don't know i i think i i'm not sure i
quite believe that it's a little the the
trouble is it's a little too on the nose
you know what i mean
it feels a little too perfect
i keep seeing it on the internet but i'm
not so sure
so france uses hand ballots in person
only
that's what people are telling me i
would say
i'd need a fact check on that
but if they did it because they they
couldn't figure out any way to secure
mail-in ballots
and electronic voting machines
well maybe there's something we have to
learn from the french about freedom
hello
have the french ever inspired americans
on the subject of freedom
they have
thank you very much french revolution
and uh lafayette we are there
but um
maybe maybe they're leading us again
france
we
we will uh we'll
you know don't you think france and
united states have such a weird and cool
history
it's probably the coolest history
between two countries
so france and the united states are two
countries that
are like siblings who don't get along
until one of the siblings is you know
challenged by a bully
it's like yeah
screw you screw you
we do it this way you do it that way
until one of us gets you know threatened
by a bully
and then the other one's there
boom
it's kind of it's it's probably the
i think america and france are
um joined by some kind of you know joint
soul
feels like
because of history
um
great britain i'm not so sure about
[Laughter]
you know obviously we have a special
relationship with great britain that's
very real
but i'm not so sure they're always on
our side if you know what i mean
uh
the russia collusion hoax would be the
top of my list of things which make me
say huh
i'm not so sure they're always on our
side
anyway so this maricopa county thing is
interesting
carrie lake who's the
uh charismatic republican candidate this
is a primary not the full election if
you didn't know
looks like she's gonna win the primary
but here's the weird thing that happened
you know how republicans always expect
that the vote will go one way until the
middle of the night
and then something sketchy happens in
the middle of the night and everything
changes and you wake up in the morning
and your team lost
well carrie lake
went into the evening i think
behind
and then there was a sketchy thing that
happens overnight
and then she was ahead
which is the opposite of how that's
supposed to work except how is it
supposed to work if it's a republican
running against a republican
is the accusation that republicans are
rigging elections against other
republicans
i'm a little confused about what people
are accusing maricopa of at the moment i
understand the past accusations but at
the moment is somebody really saying
that somebody is going to make
that
maybe the
the democrats or who
who's in charge of maricopa's elections
democrats or republicans
is maricopa democrats or republicans
it's got to be democrats right or we
wouldn't be talking about it
it's a democrat city okay
so if the democrats are in charge of the
maricopa
would the democrats
have a strong preference of making kerry
lake lose because i think she's the
stronger candidate
see here's the problem
as soon as you get into the second level
of the conspiracy the odds of it being
true start to drop
if you told me one level of conspiracy
it's my belief
that some election or other got rigged
that's a that's a simple straightforward
proposition maybe
maybe he did maybe he didn't but as soon
as you tell me i think it got rigged and
i got rigged to make the weaker
candidate win because then in the next
election now you've got that second
level
not impossible
because we've seen that they did that
with trump right
there's
credible reporting i would say
that democrats thought trump would be
the easier candidate to beat
so maybe they think that about carrie
lake and maybe it was some kind of
conspiracy in the middle of the night
but it doesn't feel like democrats would
rig
a republican governor primary
it feels a little too clever
i know
if you told me that the news was
favoring one candidate over another
because that they wanted you to you know
pick the wrong one i'd say okay that
sounds like something would happen
but rigging an election
taking the chance of rigging an election
simply to get the preferred candidate a
little bit weaker one
i don't buy it
yeah i don't buy it
i don't think you take the chance when
you know that republicans all pretty
much get the same amount of votes in
arizona
i'm not entirely sure that kerry lake
would have done that much better than
anything with a republican
name on it
i i feel every republican is going to
get about the same number of votes when
the actual election comes
so i don't feel that they would have
taken the chance to rig that
when everybody is looking at
maricopa i mean maricopa knows they were
going to get looked at right
they know all eyes were on that i just
don't buy it anyway
that's one thing one hypothesis that's
out there
but listen to how the
the daily beast tries to uh
put air cover
down so here's what the daily beast said
today in in that article
and they quote mike lindell
about the results
and then they're going to say that he
has a
obvious dissonance
obvious dissonance so i'm going to give
you the quote
i want you to find out
find the obvious dissonance now what
that means is
that mike lindell is saying two things
are true that can't both be true
so that's the accusation so i'm gonna
i'm gonna tell you what he said
and you tell me if the daily beast
correctly characterizes that as
two things that can't both be true
here's what here's what mike lindell
said
quote about carrie lake
she won
what are you talking about of course
there was election fraud he told the
daily beast
she won in spite of the algorithm
he added
attempting to reason obvious dissonance
between the two ideas
quote
so much corruption in arizona
now
where is the distance
i believe this is a very clear statement
of opinion again it's opinion this is
not my opinion
mike lindell's opinion
is that there was some corruption but
not enough to stop the candidate because
she was a strong candidate
where in the world is the dissonance
that's just a straight description of a
thing that could happen
now i'm not saying it happened
i don't have evidence of that
but
how in the world does the daily beast
get away with describing that as obvious
dissonance
it's not only not dissonance it's
definitely not obvious
to me it's obvious it's not
you know i think we've gotten to the
point
which they they used to just sort of
tell you fake news stories
and if you didn't do your own research
which hardly ever works you couldn't
tell the difference
but now they're putting the fake news in
the sentence that debunks its own fake
news
they are so bold about lying to you that
they can put the debunk to their own lie
in their own paragraph
because right here in your very own eyes
you can read
then mike lindell said two things that
make obvious sense together
and then they said these two things
don't make sense together
right
i mean that's what happened he said two
things that make perfect sense together
and then the writer said in the same
paragraph well there's an obvious
dissonance
where
and they get away with it of course
all right i told you i'm writing a book
on reframes
and
i saw one here
that i thought i could improve on goes
like this
this is a tweet from bow tied bowl
who wrote to this
and it's advice
the key to not getting mad about
mistakes people make is simple
assume they actually tried their best
now you just feel bad for them like a
disabled cat or dog
um okay what do you think of that as a
reframe instead of getting mad at people
for their mistakes
just sort of pity them because they're
not capable they did their best
yeah okay
all right here's here's my version of
her reframe
i said i don't get angry at others for
their mistakes
because it's a ridiculous standard
and it would lead to self-hatred if i
start judging you for your mistakes
what the hell am i going to think of
myself
do you ever think of that
what am i going to use one standard for
you and a different standard for myself
how am i going to pull that off in my
brain i mean i'd like to be a little bit
consistent if i think if i decide that
you suck because you made an actual just
mistake
what am i going to think about myself i
make mistakes every day
all the time i consistent like all the
time i'm making mistakes and correcting
and adjusting
so i would say that uh getting mad at
people for mistakes as opposed to
intentional evil
if somebody does something intentionally
evil to you oh get mad
don't let that one go
if somebody intentionally does something
to you i would recommend getting extra
mad
not not even like ordinary mad
under those conditions get as mad as you
want
right you should push back as hard as
you want on those but if it's an honest
mistake the kind you see every day
i would say here's the way to judge
people instead of their mistakes
judge them by how they fix their
mistakes
how they respond to it
do they apologize do they clarify do
they try to make it better or do they
tell you what they're going to do next
time to make it to make it not a problem
because that's the standard i would want
you to judge me
if you judge me by
my screw-ups i'm not going to be too
happy about that
because i have screw-ups
can you imagine talking you know an hour
a day
live
about recently breaking events
and not getting a lot of mistakes in
there like fact check wrong you know
legal opinions
technology wrong how many mistakes have
you seen me make my god
i mean i can't even count the number of
mistakes i've made in a live stream
um
right
so
if i were to judge myself by the
standard i'd have to you know
go go end myself or something because it
would just be horrible
but instead
i use the same standard for myself which
is
when you correct me and i say oh
looks like
looks like i was wrong i try to tell you
because this isn't the show about me
being right there are shows like that
there are shows about i'm right and you
know you're learning from me but i'm
more about uh this is a
collaborative intelligence
oh you know actually let's use that
phrase
i believe that what we're all engaged in
exactly at this moment
is a collaborative intelligence
that's a pretty good phrase for it
anything a collaborative intelligence i
put i put ideas out
you judge them in real time you a b test
them for me in real time and then i
adjust
not always but i try to
um all right
so that's my reframe
and
um i've got a book coming with a whole
bunch more of them
by the way
do you see the the power in these
reframes i don't know if i've completely
made my case but when i started putting
them all together
i think i'm going to have a list of
somewhere between
probably 75 and 100 when i'm done
of reframes that individually
could change your life
like any one of them
and i'm gonna have a hundred of them
i think most people will find five of
them you know at a minimum five they'll
just completely change their
effectiveness in life or at least their
attitude about life
somebody says i'm too old and dumb to
get anything out of your reframes i take
that as a challenge
i'm gonna i'm gonna make a
statement that i think is
fairly extreme
but that i can easily back it up
this is what i believe
that a hundred percent of the people who
read
the book i'm writing you know when it's
done 100 of them will find a substantial
benefit
from at least at least one
of the dozens and dozens of reframe
ideas because they're too powerful not
to work
a lot a lot of the reframes work just
because you read them
you don't have to do anything
the the beauty of a reframe
is that you don't have to do the work
have you ever seen a self-help book
where it starts out with all right
number one
buy yourself a diary
and write in your diary every day
something or other you know what you ate
or what you're thinking and what you're
doing now i'm not going to say that
wouldn't work
the problem is you won't do it
it doesn't matter how good the
suggestion is if you're not going to do
it
you know i i make the same argument with
exercise
do you notice the the best kind of
exercise for you
let me ask you if you know this
what's the best form of exercise go in
the comments
number one best form of exercise go
somebody says swimming somebody says
walking
yeah i'll give you the answer
the answer is the one you'll you're
willing to do
that's it
the the best exercise is the one you're
willing to do
because that's the problem
whenever you talk about the best
exercise you've already you're making
you you're making me think past the sale
you haven't made the sale
don't tell me the best kind of exercise
if you haven't convinced me to exercise
right
the sale
hasn't hasn't happened yet
so i say the best exercise is the one
you're willing to do
because what happens if you do exercise
on a regular basis doesn't matter what
it is walking
let's say you walk every day for
exercise because that's what you're
willing to do but you're not willing to
walk very far
you're only willing to walk i don't know
half a mile
that's all you could do it's all you're
willing to do but you do it every day
because you like it
what happens if you walk half a mile
every day for a year
sooner or later
almost guaranteed
you're going to say to yourself
you know
i feel so good today i do this half hour
every day you know this half mile is so
easy
i'll just add another
another half mile
and it'll be easy
and then the next time you go out it's
like you know half a mile seems so
little now
like when i did that mile that felt kind
of good
next thing you know you'll meet some
other people and you'll talk about what
what do you do and they'll say i i'm
playing this new game called pickleball
sort of sweeping the nation i don't know
if you if you've noticed but pickleball
is a big sport that's happening now and
their friends will say hey let's do some
pickleball
and you say sure i'll try that once and
then you like it and then you add that
because you like it
so the number one thing you got to do is
find something you're willing to do
learning how to do it right and learning
better ways to diversify and get things
right that will happen just by hanging
around with people who know how to do it
do you know how i know how to use the
weight machine
in in the gym
by hanging around in the gym
and looking at people so oh
reading the little sign and trying
something and seeing if i liked it
basically just trial and error and
hanging out
is simply being around people who
exercise
will
will just rub off on you you just learn
a bunch of things
right for example i didn't always know
that it's a good idea to have protein
immediately after weight training
but somewhere i heard it i don't know i
picked it up somewhere along the line i
read it i watched it somebody mentioned
it i don't know
but now i do it
so my point is if you start with what's
my what's my ideal form of exercise
you can't get there
it's like everything else
if you want to go from you know one
point to another point
it's not always the best idea to imagine
it in its fullness
because if you do it's kind of
discouraging
it's sort of like pregnancy
you know they they say i don't i can't
verify this but they say that if you're
a woman you have a baby
you have sort of a
productive amnesia about how bad it was
so that you're willing to do it again
right so don't think about that like the
whole thing think about the part you can
do and what the part you can do is put
on your athletic shoes and walk around
the block and if that's all you can do
but you can do it every day that's it
you're on your way
all right
um
so i'm pretty sure that you will see
tremendous benefit in the reframes
a hoot
alright you have any other questions any
other stories i missed
yeah how do we eat an elephant
what is book expected out i don't know
maybe in the spring
spring of next year
i will probably i'm hoping to be done by
the end of the year but it takes a while
to for it to come out
uh somebody was late today on the locals
on the locals program
somebody just joined us if you don't
mind i'd like to start over
no
not really
all right i hope you've noticed
have you noticed that i have
intentionally tried to make the tone of
this live stream
more positive
and less less angry and yelling
and
the reason i'm doing that is because i
think there's more of a
an untapped hunger for that
i do not believe there's an untapped
hunger for objective news that shows
both sides
i don't think there's any hunger for
that but there's definitely a hunger for
something that just doesn't suck
and so i'm trying to do that to the to
the degree uh possible
so i'm probably going to take the
f-bombs down a little bit
because i i tend to put them in my angry
tirades
now i should tell you and i want to be
completely transparent about this the
angry tirades are all real
like i'm not acting
um but i do get you know i get caught up
in the moment
because it's a shared experience so i
think you give me some energy that i
wouldn't have if i'm just sitting in a
room by myself
so the rants are real in the sense that
i'm feeling it as it's happening
but i also feel that i could control it
more than i do
um
somebody says no this are the best parts
but well but i'll also make you this
promise
if i feel it
it's probably going to happen anyway
right i'm just not going to throw it in
as a normal
normal baseline expectation that i'm
going to be dropping angry stuff in
there
so i'm going to try to show you
the best
of what's coming
and by the way
look at the news today and you tell me
that we're not entering the golden age
are you ready
i mean just
let's just go over this was the news
today
right if you're not in ukraine which is
a show
this was the news for you in america
let's see who's taking credit for the
fact that oil prices are moving in the
right direction
that's a nothing story
that's a story about something going
right i mean
not as right as it needs to be but it's
going right
the alex jones thing is really about one
person in a ridiculous situation it's
not really about you at all
um
you know that i made some points
comparing them that's not really news
maricopa
i don't know i think maricopa is maybe
helping us more than is hurting us
honestly
because the more maricopa situations are
the more energy we're going to put on
making sure we don't have another
maricopa situation
how many maricopas in a row
i just felt myself having to stuff
stifle an f-word
should i
should i stifle it or should i let it go
a little bit
a little bit
well i'm going to give you a small
a small f-bomb
how many times does maricopa have to
 up
before we get serious about election
security and and transparency
how many times
so this would be
twice in a row
and but
two fairly important times now suppose
the general election rolls around
and maricopa becomes a problem a third
time
is that worse for you or better
see sometimes we can't tell the
difference between
good news and bad news this maricopa
this maricopa situation is closer to
good news than bad news i would contend
now that's part of my new theme of
giving you the positive side of things
here's why
if we keep looking at maricopa and we
keep arguing about whether there was a
real election there
somebody somewhere is going to have to
fix the elections
right
the more we say that they're rigged i
don't care if it's true or false
the more the country says i don't
believe the elections because they're
not transparent and it's not a type of
election that i would have
confidence in
we
i don't have any problem with you
complaining about maricopa until
you're you're blue in the face
all right i think that's all productive
and i and i think that one of the things
that
americans do well i can't really speak
for other countries because i'm you know
i'm not exactly the world traveler i
should be
but
am i wrong that one of the things that
americans do best is is complain
is it is it sort of like baked into our
national character in some weird way
we're the most complaining group of
people
ever
you know we even complain about our
complaining if you look at the wokeness
conversation that's literally complaints
about complaining
we're we we're two levels of complaints
we're complaining about the complainers
literally
but
i don't think it's an accident
that we do so well as a country you know
i hope we can
maintain our position of some kind of
leadership we've done pretty well
uh somebody says germans are better at
criticizing themselves well i would i
would argue that
that ability to to criticize
each other and yourself just endlessly
is really a superpower
because it's the criticisms that attract
the solutions right
it's the flame that attracts sleeve
moths
and if you're not complaining you're not
moving forward
so
uh complain away
complain away
you know that that's why i'm softer on
wokeness than most of you most of you
are sort of absolutists about
take your wokeness away not me
because wokeness is basically a
complaint
that things aren't the way somebody
wants them and i say don't stop
complaining
yeah if it bothers you
i do want to know
so if somebody's got some wokeness
related complaint you know generally
and they would like me to know about it
i'd actually like to hear it if it's
real i mean if it's just made up i don't
want to hear it i don't want to hear it
as a technique
i don't want to hear it as a
mechanism to gain power
but if it's real
you know like a real citizen telling me
a real complaint about something that's
not woken off i'll totally listen to
that i'm completely open to your
complaints
complaints are like um
you know i mean when i hear complaints
it's just like cha-ching
do you know the best way to make money
in a startup
find something that's broken that
everybody hates
and then build a solution
complaints are like free money
you just have to see them that way you
know in the short run they're just
problems
but in the long run a complaint is a
gigantic market opportunity
if you could build an election system
that would make everybody happy
my god
you could sell some of that stuff
couldn't you
that's something you could sell
do you want me to uh
build a election system that works for
you every time with no question
whatsoever
build me an app that
i vote
and the app is recording me actually
voting
so it's actually showing my face
and showing me typing into my phone
and then showing the results like on the
screen at the same time maybe it's a
screen yeah actually it would just be
have to be a screen
capture
and that the only place that this would
be captured
yeah maybe it's got my fingerprints
maybe it's got my um
facial recognition
but it's a screen capture that shows my
face
you know looking into my phone or device
so the phone is looking at me when i'm
looking at it so it's recording me and
then on top of my face
is the vote questions and i'm typing in
my answers
and then when i'm done i have a complete
video record of me personally voting and
what i picked
and also the data from it so the data
goes in and then anytime i want to i can
use my same app
to query my data it goes into the system
and it it gets my information back and
then sees if it matches how i voted now
you can still you can still break that
you know because i don't know if i'm
getting the real information back or
some kind of spoofed version
but i think you could audit that
you know it's something that could be
audited
right
so it's not as if you can't fix it
so somebody has an enormous market
opportunity to just build an app
that's foolproof you don't think that
could be done
i think he can
i i think that somebody clever can make
a voting system that just can't be
hacked
and then somebody will do it
so complaints are money there's your
reframe
complaints or money
that's one of the most useful things
you'll ever hear in your life
complaints are money
it just has to be you know
transferred into a spendable form that
but that's why you're that's what your
startup does
there's no such thing as can't be hacked
that's correct there's no such thing as
can't be hacked
but there might be such a thing as
you can't be hacked without getting
caught
that might be a thing
because audits are a thing
so as long as there is a good enough
audit there's no hack that could change
the
result
absolutes are never true but you know
what i mean
uh sunlight is the best disinfectant
unless you are
trump in which case that's called
drinking bleach and it's totally totally
bad idea
all right
all you need is a receipt
all you need is a receipt
no
how would you know that the receipt
matches what actually was recorded in
the data and how would you know that
there were extra people
i guess that would be the problem right
you could be sure that you voted but you
couldn't be sure that someone who isn't
real
didn't also vote
so i guess my
my my suggestion has a big hole in it
but i do believe that it can be done
you know i always hear blockchain being
recommended
but i feel as if blockchain might not be
the answer because it hasn't picked up
the kind of let's say
credibility and energy one would think
it would
you would think that a hundred percent
of technical people would be saying
blockchain if it really was obvious that
that worked
i feel like there's enough disagreement
in the technical world about blockchain
yeah being gamed
that the smartest of the smart people
are not saying it
here's my feeling but this is just this
is just a feeling it feels like people
were smart enough to know what
blockchain is believe it could solve the
voting problem
but the people who are smart enough
to create a blockchain
don't
give me a fact check on that i'll say it
again the people were smart enough to
describe a blockchain think it would
work
the people who are smart enough to
create a blockchain
don't don't have that same confidence
check that see if that's true
all right
paper ballots we all like paper ballots
i'm seeing some confirmations but i
don't know if you could trust any of us
yet
uh the the smartest blockchain
developers say you should use paper
right
somebody says now i hate myself i'm
sorry robert but
i know i just did that to a whole bunch
of you because i was in that camp
you know i you've heard me say you know
can you use blockchain
as if i knew enough to actually answer
that question but the the lack of the
people who actually
are smart enough to be a developer for
blockchain the fact that they're not
telling me to use
it that means something
i'm not going to ignore that
all right well i think this is the best
show that's ever been on
i think we have set the standard
for conversations in the united states
from
california to pennsylvania
and i'm going to drop one little
tidbit that i'm not going to say on
youtube i'm going to save that for the
locals crowd after i sign off on youtube
but that's what they pay for they get
the special behind the scenes
stuff in fact i'm going to ask their
advice on
a dicey situation i'm trying to figure
out so
youtube
thanks for joining in spotify too i'll
talk to you tomorrow
