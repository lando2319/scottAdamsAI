I'm sure you're happy if you own stocks
today it's looking good in the stock
market bitcoin's up I feel sorry for the
Jaguar there's a Jaguar meme that's
pretty funny all right let me call up
your comments here on
locals to make
[Music]
sure make sure I'm seeing the best of it
here it is
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need is a CER muger glass a tanker
cheler Stein a canteen suar flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine end of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous
up it happens now
go
a so so
good well the first uh
starlink satellite direct the cell phone
constellation is now complete I think I
think that means you can't quite use it
yet but the physical assets of
satellites are in the right place so
very soon according to Elon
Musk you'll be able to use your regular
unmodified cell phone to use starlink as
a phone
network and apparently the uh there's
also something happening with starlink
that's going to greatly reduce the
latency which is a big deal with the
satellite stuff uh I guess the uh next
ring of satellites is going to be closer
to the Earth it's going to make a big
big difference in how fast your your
Starling speed is so that's cool and
other cool news according to Zion
lights um which is the name of a person
by the way Zion
lights uh Britain's uh is installing his
first nuclear reactor in 30 years at
Hinkley point
so that's good news right do you
remember when the UK used to be an ally
of the United States I remember that
that that was cool but now they're uh I
don't know what they are now but they're
going to have a lot of nuclear power so
would have been good if they had done
that 30 years ago
maybe uh there's a there was a uh
accidental scientific
discovery Live Science is reporting it
according to Owen Hugh
uh they they accidentally discovered
something they could lower the The
energy needed to store
things the energy needed to store data
could go down by up to a billion times
it could be a billion times more energy
efficient than current
technology now I don't think we have any
idea of how good the Golden Age could
be it could be really good because if
we've got Europe putting in the you know
nuclear energy and we've got starlink
giving us competition with satellites
and phones and we've got uh you know a
billion times Advantage I mean it's
early in the technology they haven't
developed it
yet but it looks like it would work and
then we've got uh according to the
guardian Google's deep mind they AI can
predict weather way better than the
other way they've been doing it so
they're using artificial intelligence
and it's 20% better than what they've
been using up till
now yeah it seems like a 20% advantage
in forecasting the weather would make a
big
deal because I make a lot of decisions
based on the weather don't you and if
you get it wrong it can be expensive
like you can actually probably save a
lot of money just by having better uh
weather
forecasts so that's
cool um according to uh future
Futurity that's a publication and Byron
spice he says that robots uh are getting
some new tech that allows them to figure
out how to manipulate their physical
environment without understanding
everything about the objects so in other
words it robots are Prett good at doing
the exact same thing over and over but
if you show them let's say a a table
full of dishes and you say pick up these
dishes or set this table or cook a meal
and has to figure out every new move
like the first Di's ever seen
it um it's not good at that but
apparently there's a new
approach and it's making a big deal so
some PhD student mortaza Deli
at the uh School of computer science and
Robotics Institute at Carnegie
melon um apparently they've got this new
breakthrough so they can just sort of
show it its situation and tell it what
to do and it can figure out how to
manipulate every object in its
domain that would be amazing now but the
thing I always complain about with
robots is that they're always slow and I
I just don't get
that and I've said this before but
correct me if I'm wrong I have to do my
robot impression again if if you saw a
robot in the 1950s tried to do anything
it would
be and then if you see a
robot 50 years later with all the modern
technology and and you know super
Computing the robot is still
[Music]
like they couldn't make it
faster I I get that it's hard to make it
accurate
but they can never make it faster so it
always has to go slow slowly I don't
know I don't get that part well the
Daniel peny uh jury is maybe back
deliberating I have not yet heard of a
uh of a conclusion so I believe the
Daniel Penny jury got sent home
yesterday cuz they had not made a
decision so they should be back at it
today I think judge Janine on the five
said with some confidence that we'll see
a a verdict
today um I I love I love judge Janine's
context lots of times because she's got
the experience so she can just sort of
look at this case and say oh yeah
they'll have a verdict today she's
probably right
and here's what I think the verdict will
be hung jury
uh I predict that they will not be able
to make a decision because it's just too
political there's going to be at least
one person on that jury who says he has
to go to jail because they don't want to
face the angry crowds outside or they
just think that's the right thing to do
I guarantee there will be at least one
person on the jury who says you're going
to have to kill me before you put this
guy in
jail let me say that again there's a
very high chance there's at least one
person on that jury who's saying
effectively you know not out loud but
effectively you'd have to kill me to put
him in jail because that's what I'd be
thinking if you put me on that
jury I would say I don't care what the
other 11 of you have to say you would
have to kill me to put him in jail under
these circumstances you would have to
kill me so hung jury I don't think
there's any way to get a
verdict do
you do you see any way that 12 people
will agree that he's either completely
guilty or completely not
guilty I don't see
it because there's way too much
subjectivity in this there shouldn't be
but there
is so that's my prediction
hungery um bre bar news is
reporting this
is this is my favorite Story the day
that the uh VA uh Veterans
Administration uh official in a
Tennessee Veterans Hospital apparently
they were having all kinds of sex
orgies at the VA hospital and there was
one VA official who allegedly had sex
with 32 different co-workers
and they didn't include a
photo are are you just teasing me are
you telling me that there's a
citizen who is so is so
sexy that that he or she I don't know if
it was a he or she was capable of having
sex with 32 different
co-workers I've got to see a
picture you you can't tease me with a
headline like that and not show me the
picture especially if it was a
dude because they don't say male or
female I'm I'm assuming female just
because that's a lot of numbers but what
if it was a
guy wouldn't you like to see a picture
of a guy who could successfully have sex
with 32 co-workers like that must be the
best looking guy in the
world unless it's a woman than maybe you
know lower
standard still need a photo
all right I know you want to talk about
the uh the tragedy of the murder of the
CEO of United healthare Healthcare
insurance company um and here are the
things we know about it apparently he
was a CEO of a insurer who was famous
for turning down the most uh requests
for coverage so they they seem to have
an industry wildly highest um
declines now I don't know if that had to
do with what Market they were serving it
could be that they were serving a down
market and so there was just more more
fraud or something but uh they were
famous for declining uh
declining uh I guess insurance
claims what um when we watched the video
I think all of you saw the video of the
murder on the streets of New York and
Manhattan um how many of you said when
you saw it well there's a professional
hit right there in the comments tell me
how many of you said there's a
professional
hit did any of you say
that because I watched it too and if
there's one thing I can tell you for
sure that was no professional
[Laughter]
hit that was someone who never even used
the gun he used for the
hit do you think he' ever used that that
gun with a
silencer no no he never done it he never
shot it even once because it it's but
once you saw how many times he had to
clear it or reload it or Reco it or
whatever the hell he was doing it was
obvious that he did not have
practice I mean it was just the wrong
wrong device now I saw a lot of the
people know way more about guns than I
do debating what the actual gun want
and uh the
uh the person who seemed to know the
most um seemed to indicate that he
didn't know how to match his
silencer with his weapon so I don't know
enough about this topic but apparently
you need the right kind of silencer for
the right kind of weapon and you need
the right kind of
ammunition depending on what you're
doing so it looked like he did not have
that all figured out so professional
Hitman probably not the other the other
thing arguing against it is the first
shot was from a distance which doesn't
seem professional I think the first one
should have been closer police are
saying that I think um and he had a cell
phone on him which is a strange thing to
do if you're a murderer and uh he left
on a traceable rented bike
now despite those
things he did get
away so I don't think you can use these
as examples of somebody who didn't know
how to do a murder and get away with it
since he did a murder and he got away
with it
so he definitely did some thinking and
he it wasn't a random act it wasn't uh
it wasn't something that was uh well it
wasn't random it was obviously directed
at this one
person so my take is that it's somebody
smart enough to do some research and put
together a fairly complicated plan
including a
getaway but not somebody who does did it
for a living it it didn't look like a
professional and not only that but he
left him alive when he left the guy he
was still alive when he left and they
tried to save him but they couldn't
now um there will be much
speculation about this um but we're
still in the fog of grime you know the
fog of War when all the news is wrong
and later three weeks later you find out
oh all the initial reports were wrong
well one of the initial reports I think
ABC News had it is that the some of the
bullets found at the
scene um some of the apparently he had
some you know actual rounds that hadn't
been fired
that he left on the scene CU he was I
loading loading one round at a time into
his weird little gun and some of them
dropped so none of this makes complete
sense but
apparently the reporting which I'm going
to tell you I don't believe is that the
rounds had the words deny defend and
depose on the shell casings oh the shell
casings not not the actual round
maybe would it be a I'm not sure if it
was a shell if it was a shell casing
that means it was a spent round
right and it said it was left of the
scene now those words are the title of a
book about uh how insurers don't pay
claims
now first of all is it true that the
name of a book is written on some of
those shell casings do you believe
that do you believe that the shell Cas
casings have the name of a book on
them I'm going to say
no I'm going to say that's a little bit
I don't
know I don't know I I just don't see it
because at the very least it would be
one more way to get caught right
so here's one
possibility one possibility is that
because he was in an industry where you
know customers can get really mad if
their claims are
denied that uh maybe somebody had a
personal reason to kill them but they're
diverting attention over to this
unprovable everybody in the world wants
to kill him because the business he's in
it's kind of a perfect cover and if you
were trying to
divert to a alibi story or you know some
some alternative explanation you might
write the name of a healthcare book on
your
bullets but
otherwise no I don't think you'd write
it on the bullet
casing none of this sounds real so I'm
going to guess so here's my first
speculation my first speculation is the
ABC report is fake and that there's
nothing written on any bullets or
casings that's my first
thing if there is something written on
the bullet casing
um that doesn't mean that was the real
reason because you could it's just as
easy to imagine that that was a
diversion than it was a real
reason so there could be any number of a
dozen different reasons there was some
report about the CEO being investigated
for insider trading but I have no reason
to believe that's true um everything you
hear is going to be fog of ore fog of
crime
so uh so I guess the first thing I'd say
is since these are all innocent
civilians as far as we know not to make
you know any any claims about any bad
behavior by the people who are the
victims so at this point we have we have
a family that's that are victims and
that's all we know so I wouldn't I
wouldn't speculate beyond that but I
would speculate that early information
about it is probably wrong and I'm
certain it's not a professional it's a
professional who didn't know to cover
his nose with his mask I
mean it didn't look that professional to
me maybe it was a bad professional maybe
it was his first day at
work
anyway um wired says they can trick AI
powered robots into doing dangerous and
violent things you know with a V variety
of tricks
and uh it makes me wonder especially
after this um CEO tragedy murder it
makes me wonder if we're near the end of
human
murder because it'll be so much easier
to send a machine to do it it'll still
be a human who's you know behind the
murder but if you could get a a drone to
do it for
you I feel like you'd send the robot or
you'd send the Drone or you'd hack into
the self driving
car I I feel like all murder in 10 years
is going to be a v robot or AI or
self-driving car or airplane that falls
out of the sky on top of you or
something so I got a feeling murder is
going to look really
different well according
to who was
this according to
somebody um I think this was uh
rasmason rasmason said that uh heg Seth
has a lot of support with GOP voters as
you would
suspect um and Democrats don't like it
as You' suspect which makes me think I
wonder about this whole confirmation
process if the confirmation process
turns into predictably you know exactly
what the Democrats are going to vote for
and you know exactly what the
Republicans are going to vote for I
it makes me wonder if the whole you know
approving of people is we have to do
something different because if it just
lines up along party lines every time it
really doesn't
work so this might be the uh the cycle
that tells us to rethink that whole
situation well according to also
wired um they checked a bunch of random
phones from people who thought that they
might have problems with their phones so
it wasn't wasn't completely random it
was people who suspected there might be
some spyware on their phones because
they had those kinds of jobs and sure
enough they found seven phones out of
2500 yeah out of 2500 devices they found
seven of them had that Pegasus infection
now Pegasus is the the super bad
spy Spy version like it's not it's not
the one you want on your phone at
all but here's my problem uh the company
that found it makes a makes an app or
software I guess that checks
for uh that kind of
infection how can how can you ever check
or how can you ever trust the company
that makes the software that checks for
the
viruses how could you ever trust
them like I I get that I can't trust the
virus but if somebody's in the business
of of essentially having enough control
over your phone that they can see if you
have a virus wouldn't they be the
perfect carrier for a
virus so I'm not making any accusations
about any specific companies I'm just
saying if you let somebody have full
access to your device to check if
somebody else had full access to your
device I I feel like you might be
trading one problem for another so I
don't know I guess I don't have any
trust for virus scanning
companies
um but there's also a report that uh
China says that the telecoms in the US
all got hacked well not all of them but
AT&T Verizon and others and that the
hackers Chinese hackers allegedly got
into live calls call records and even
top secret systems in DC and the
government is advising if you want to be
safe you should use encrypted apps like
signal and
WhatsApp now here's one of those stories
if you were a casual consumer of news
that would all make sense wouldn't it oh
let's see if my regular phone might be
corrupted by hackers I could just use an
encrypted app oh and the government
recommends it well that's a
idea that's if you didn't know that the
government almost certainly has a back
door to those encrypted
apps so you'd be basically giving
away I don't know but there there's no
way you're not going to be
hacked if the government doesn't have
you already the Chinese hackers will get
you or the phone company themselves will
have insiders you just have to
assume that everything you write and
everything you've ever said is
discoverable and I don't know how many
times I'll need to tell you that
probably until you get caught on your
own but there's no there's no such thing
as
privacy um this is one of those things I
predicted years
ago so years ago I predicted that
fighting over whether you could you know
whether we'd protect our privacy it's
worth the fight but you weren't going to
win the the the direction of Technology
pretty much guarantees a complete loss
of
privacy and I'm not saying it should but
we will be we will be seduced by you
know various features of of Technology
you we're most of us are going to have a
robot in our
homes do you do you know what loss of
privacy you're going to have when you
have a robot in your house listening to
every conversation it it knows who
you're having sex with because it sees
you come and
go we're about to give up whatever is
left of your privacy by having a little
recording device following you around I
mean it's not bad enough I've got a I've
got a recording device right behind me
and one in my
hand they're already able to record
anything that some hacker wants them to
record um but if the robot is actually
following me from room to room
good luck with your
privacy all
right um Step Miller advisor to
Trump um he was outlining at Trump's
first 100 days and he says it's going to
be a new golden age a new golden
age
um I believe I I started predicting the
golden age in
2017 got derailed by at least four years
um but maybe we're there maybe the
golden age is uh kicking off and one of
the things that Steve Miller points
sound is what he calls a rapid total
complete deregulation of American Energy
exploration is that
accurate do do we really want a rapid
total and complete
deregulation I don't know enough about
that domain to know if that makes sense
because my my Common Sense tells me
there must be some regulation that makes
sense is there are there
literally literally is there no
regulation there's not even one in this
entire domain of energy exploration
there's not one thing that keeps you
safe without a big cost that's not worth
it I don't know I think it's
hyperbole but but maybe not that this is
one where I can't tell is it hyperbole
to say that it's going to be complete
deregulation or is it maybe just Federal
deregulation and there might be some
state
regulations I don't know it sounds good
but I've got questions about
it but
uh there there's a funny thing happening
here with uh common
sense and
let me just skip ahead so Jeff Bezos of
Amazon he was asked as some event about
Trump 2.0 and he said he's very
optimistic because there are too many
regulations and list listen to what he
says this is Jeff
Bezos he says quote I'm actually very
optimistic this time around meaning
Trump's second term he seems to have a
lot of energy around reducing regulation
and from my point of view if I can help
him do that I'm going to help him
because we do have too many regulations
I think he was talking about Elon Musk
as well as Trump um if you look at the
national debt blah blah blah the only
way we can get out of it is by growing
out of it and the only way we're going
to do that is by slashing
regulations now what part of that was
anything but common
sense that was just common sense right
and I don't see Republican and Democrat
anymore
yeah th those those categories they seem
to be
dissolving I mean I watching another
clip from Bill Mah and Bill Mah is very
cleanly in the common sense
category and um he was talking to his
guest I'm not sure when this was filmed
but I just saw the clip today and he was
saying that this country does need a big
disruption so he's actually going to so
Bill Mah one of the biggest critics of
trump ever has said he's not predicting
success but he's not going to criticize
it in advance because the country needs
basically a slap you know colonoscopy
and a slap in the face I think he said
and so so that's a completely Common
Sense point of
view because a reasonable person can say
we have to grow faster to get out of our
debt a reasonable person would say we
need something kind of more dramatic
change than we've had before these are
all just perfectly sensible points of
view and none of this is Republican is
it I mean you can't really say that
Democrats love overregulation
that's not really a thing so something
just wonderful is
happening about uh people you'd expect
to be on the other team saying wait a
second wait a second are you just doing
Common Sense over there because I can
sign up for common sense I can't sign up
for your
party but all those things look smart
why can't we do the things that make
sense so big uh big props to Jeff Bezos
and uh Bill Mah in this context I'll
have other things I might want to
complain about but in this context Bill
Mah is definitely on the side of the
Patriots I would say so
good to have him good to have him on
board not completely he'll be he'll
still be a trump critic but he's not
abandoning common sense to get
there
um let me do a clarification about
something I said about the cash
Patel um
nomination
so I mentioned on X and then people
jumped all over me because I think they
misinterpreted what I meant on x but on
X you can't give as much context so if
they didn't hear me talk about it they
probably didn't have a a good idea what
I was up about
so according to the Vigilant
Fox which is one of the accounts I like
to follow on a and the Vigilant Fox is
completely right
leaning bias right so they're completely
right leaning but they they re
referenced uh media ites list of cash
Patel's what they would call an enemies
list people he thinks need to be dealt
with either by their security clearance
being taken away or there might be some
legal
issues so some people went after me and
said oh you believe this bad mediaite
Source well no but I'm pretty sure that
it's agreed on by both sides so if
mediaite were the only one publishing an
enemy list and nobody else did and
nobody else thought there was an enemy's
list then I'm say I don't even think
there is one sounds like fake news but
the Vigilant fox seems to think that
this list is reasonably close to reality
somebody said that cash has a book which
lists people and maybe maybe a more
complete argument for why they would be
targeted but let me clarify
I'm not saying that there shouldn't be a
Target
list I'm saying that publishing it is a
really bad
idea because if you publish a Target
list then you immediately fall into the
Stalin model of naming the person before
the
crime now the fact that mediaite can
turn it into just a list of targets and
they can strip out the alleged crimes
puts you in in a real dangerous place
especially if you make the mistake of
repeating their list without the list of
allegations against them now if it had
been always the person plus the
allegation then I would say I don't love
this but at least you're at least you're
making sure that we see the alleged
crime first if you show me the person
first separated from the crime even if
your enemy is the one who made the list
you're in a disadvantaged situation
but it gets
worse why would you ever Telegraph to
your let's call them
enemies what your plan
is so as of yesterday we find out that
there's conversation about preemptive
pardoning of people that might be
targeted by cash Patel so it might
include fouchi and Liz Cheney and Adam
Chef so in other words having a list of
what you're of who you're going to go
after is also the list of
Pardons so at the at the last day Biden
could say all right every single person
who's on this cash Patel Target list
you're all
pardoned and you know what I would
say
nothing because if you make it this easy
for the other side to Pardon everybody
that you want to go after I mean you're
kind of bringing this on
yourself I would be happy just to have
them out of out of public office and you
know not having influence but if you
publish their names first and then that
causes them all to get preemptive
pardons I'm not even going to
about it because you just walk right
into that it's like just you set your
own trap and then you then you triggered
your own trap you trapped yourself so
just to be
clear I'm not defending any of the
people who are on the list
because there there's some pretty
sketchy behavior on that
list I'm just saying that that
approaching it as a list of enemies even
if you've got really good arguments and
there are there are good arguments it's
not a good strategy it's just a bad
strategy it's a bad look and it I think
it's bad for the supporters because it
makes you look like you're you're
supporting Stalin basically I'll give
you the list of people and we'll figure
out later what they did CU we don't like
them
so now I'm not saying that uh further
clarification I'm not saying that cash
would make up crimes I'm not saying that
I'm saying that the way that it's
presented makes it easy to attack as if
he is doing that so don't do that but
it's too late it's already
done but uh let's see speaking of cash
he also sent out a legal
notice um this is according to the
George account on X yeah so cash Patel
his lawyers sent out a legal notice to
Mike Pence's advisor somebody named
Olivia Troya because she was on a on the
joy read Show recently and she said some
things about cash Patel that I guess
cash and his lawyers think are are
uh complete Fabrications and asking him
to take him back so she said cash Patel
is a delusional liar and he lied about
intelligence and he made made things up
and uh and she had to check his work and
blah blah blah so Patel's lawyers are
threatening
litigation and
uh here's the thing that I think is the
most interesting part about this
story Mike Pence has
advisers Mike Pence as
advisers um let's check their work let's
see Mike Pence is the only person in
politics Who Rose the level of vice
president but at the moment would not be
able to get any job in politics am I
right Mike Pence would not be able to
get any job in
politics so so far the advisor is not
killing it but politics is not the only
game
at least he could you know Mike Pence
could get a job working for the
news oh no he probably can't because the
news on the right or right leaning
networks wouldn't want to have anything
to do with them and left leaning
networks wouldn't want to have anything
to do with them so let's see Mike Pence
has advisors and where he's ended up at
the result of this advice is can't get a
job in any domain in which he's
qualified
she she's advised him into complete
irrelevance if not
bankruptcy now I shouldn't be laughing
at him because I I don't think he
deserves that
but Mike Pence has
advisors anyway I thought that was
funny um according to an AP poll uh JD
Vance was right female cat owners voted
for Harris
59% uh and Trump
40% but Trump I think Trump won all the
other pet owners but the only pet owners
he lost were female cat
owners JD Vance toally called
[Laughter]
it female cat owners all right that was
exactly what it looked
like
um Washington examiner says that uh the
public 68% of the public is in favor of
January 6 prisoner
pardons uh in a caseby case spaces so
people are way less interested in a you
know broad General pardon uh but they
say in a case by casee basis in my
opinion that's a good first
opinion I say that because it was my
first opinion too my first opinion was
yeah you have to look at each one
individually there are 1500 of
them did did any of you sort of lose
count of how many people had been
rounded up for being Republicans there
are 1500 people in
jail for January 6 how long would it
take to look individually at all
1500 that's all I need to
know if it's going to take you a year to
figure out which of them individually
should be released you got to release
them all now you have to do them all now
if if waiting to look at them
individually is going to take months or
years I can't put up with that I I can't
put up with basically people I consider
100% innocent you know of the 1500 at
least a thousand didn't do anything but
show up and express their opinion in my
opinion so you're going to let a
thousand people rot in jail for another
few months so you can look individually
at those other ones no nope not good
enough that is not good enough you want
a better you want a better argument the
better argument is that none of those
bad people the ones that you might look
at individually and say oh this one was
actually violent none of that would have
happened if the election had not been
obviously looking
rigged we have the ability to do
elections that don't look rigged and I'm
only talking about the appearance
because I don't know you know I don't I
don't have fact that would justify
claiming certainty of it being rigged I
am certain that it looked rigged and I'm
certain that we have the ability and the
knowledge how to do an election that the
entire public would say oh that looked
Fair we do know how to do that and we
choose not to if we do know how to do it
and we choose not to and people react to
that what's the base cause of the
problem the base cause of the problem is
not the protesters the base cause of the
problem is that we in intentionally ran
an election which should have created
violence I'm not in favor of violence I
don't promote it so listen to the
sentence again on paper that election
should have created violence on paper
you should have been able to predict it
if you had known that the election was
going to go that weird way where
suddenly there were a whole bunch of
votes at the end that flipped the
election if you had known that in
advance you would have also known that
there was going to be violence or the
odds of it were going to be pretty
high so whoever designs our elections
has to take some
responsibility for creating a system
that had a very high likelihood of
generating
violence secondly if you know that
that's a possibility and there was lots
of talk about it before January 6 if you
if the Democrat leadership failed to
properly protect the place that is also
a base problem
the the protesters who actually did the
illegal acts are
legally it's their legal
responsibility so I'm making I'm making
a distinction between the people who are
legally responsible for their actions
which is only the people who did them
right so from a legal perspective the
people who did the violence it's just
their fault violence yet yet you have to
you can't design a legal system where
you're blaming Society and you know what
happened before it's the person who
actually did the ACT who's going to go
to jail or not go to jail
but this is bigger than just the
individual criminal acts it's bigger
because the election is bigger than an
individual Act and the Integrity of the
country and Justice in general and the
thousand people who were rot in jail for
an extra month or two or whatever and if
they have to figure them out
individually so given that in my opinion
the the base problem was the design of
the election system to be
non-credible followed by a very
non-credible outcome according to you
know 40% of the country probably um
followed by a complete failure to
protect the public by not having the
right amount of security where you know
you needed it now I can still say that
the individuals who did the crime broke
the law and that the law was the right
thing that to deal with it but at this
point given that maybe a thousand people
that I would not consider criminals at
all have been lumped in into that group
you you got to Pardon them all so it's
it's there are too many innocent people
in the story for the guilty people in
the story to continue to ruin the lives
of the innocent people in the story
innocent has to be bigger than guilty in
in our world so I think you've got at
least three Arguments for doing all of
them right away and I think the country
would get over it you know there would
be a huge outcry and it would be a
headline for two weeks and and the
Democrats would complain and they'd do
stories about oh this one hurt somebody
in particular so why' they do this one
but we wouldn't care that much we would
definitely get over it the country would
move on we don't really we don't want to
linger on that like nobody's going to be
harping on it two years from
now so I think it's a slam dunk I think
you do them all I'd be very disappointed
if they did Case by
case but it makes sense to say Case by
case until you actually make the
decision all right
so your two cats
agree all
right well uh H get free before one in
person yeah I'm just looking at your
comments and agreeing with
you all right ladies and gentlemen um
before we go I'd like to show you two
Comics uh they're two Dilbert comics one
from 10 years ago on the same date
calendar date and one from
today and I want you to judge if I've
lost a
step so I want you to see
am I as funny as I was 10 years ago when
you know dilber was closer to his Peak
Have I Lost anything so here will
be the uh
two the two Comics let's see so here's
from dilber reborn now these normally
would not be available to the general
public these are only for subscribers on
X or subscribers on
locals um but here dogbert's working the
tech support he's call and says uh what
kind of genital add-ons do you sell for
robots this is part of a continuing
Series where dogar is start a a startup
where he's he's selling uh genital
add-ons for your for your robot so what
kind of genital add-ons do you sell for
robots and dogar says our most popular
model is called the LeBron but for half
the price you might be interested in our
Starter Set we call the Oberman
and the person on the phone says will
the robot be happy either way and dogar
says we see a lot of sobbing with the
olberman all right so that's that's the
one for
today now if I
can properly operate
this I'll show you the calendar one from
so this is a digital calendar this is
this is not related
um this is not related to the physical
calendar that's coming out for 2025 it's
just a digital thing I do for
subscribers so here Bob the
dinosaur is talking to Dilbert and Bob
the dinosaur says haha I am now the
coolest member of the household because
I have a smartwatch hello watch what
time is it and the watch says uh this is
the anthropos Epic and Bob the dinosaur
says wow that carbon dates me
all right so that was 10 years ago so am
I Funnier
today or was I Funnier 10 years
ago well you can decide that I just
thought I'd send you that one uh one of
one of the things I do track one of the
reasons that I do the 10 years ago is I
do track to see if I've lost it like can
I still be funny now I have an advantage
with the Dilbert reborn comic because I
can be a little naughtier and that's
just it's way easier to write if you can
be a little bit naughty um so if you're
wondering what the physical dilbur
calendar which is available
only at the link dilbert.com it's not
available at Amazon it's not available
in stores only online at the link
ato.com but it has the uh
the classic Comics ones that have been
published before on the front of each
page but on the back has the slightly
naughtier Comics like the one I just
read so twice as many
Comics um than any prior year and made
in America the calendar will be made
inica is made in America for the first
time that was something I just had to do
all right I'm going to say uh say a few
words to the local subscribers privately
and uh thanks for joining on YouTube and
Rumble and X I'll see you see you on the
internet uh locals I'm coming at you
we're going to be private in 30 seconds
and the rest of you have a great
day
