that is working looks like everything's
working today it's going to be one of
those
days it's going to be a day when you put
in the ball goes in the
hole all day
long but we got a show for you while the
lazy podcasters are taking the day
off not me no I'm here for you
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and it's
going to be the best time you've ever
had in your whole life but if you'd like
to take this up to levels that nobody
can even understand with their tiny
shiny human brains all you need for that
is a c mug glass a tank of Chels of
Stein a Canen jug or flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure of the dopamine
h of the day thing makes everything
better it's called simultaneous sip
go the siage is excellent
today but what else is
happening well one of the things you
probably been asking yourself is sure
they can make robots and they can make
Rob robot dogs but can they make a robot
dog that walks underwater yes yes they
can it's called the honey badger and
according to the bite these Engineers
have a uh quadruped robot dog that can
uh it's about a foot long and it can
walk onto your pool and and it can hide
into
water now I can't think of anything
scarier than seeing robot dog come out
of
water if I'm ever by a stream and a
robot dog ever comes out of that stream
and starts coming at me I'm going to
run very very fast but then the other
robot dogs will catch up with me and
overtake me and put me in a cocoon and
harvest me for energy I assume I mean I
don't want to read too much into it but
uh I do think robot dog walks underwater
harvests me for energy giant cocoon
I think it
follows and now according to Science
Blog scientists can create cancer
patients as digital twins to predict how
well something will go that's right they
can create your digital twin and then
they can put that digital twin in some
digital uh medical study and then they
can see how you do as a digital twin
before they do it to your real body
which uh as it WR raises some
interesting questions doesn't
it such
as how many digital twins will you have
for every base reality
U might you have a digital twin for each
kind of problem you might have for
example might I create a digital twin
that figures out how to solve all the
water related damage in my house every
single day
H it could be that you're already a
digital twin and that you've been
created just so the real person who is
you can see how your Solutions work and
so having a digital cancer twin makes
perfect sense and by the way there are
there are a number of efforts in the
world where people are trying to figure
out whether medicines are working the
way they're supposed to work for your
cancer patients and other people as well
so digital twin H now when they talk
about it they don't mean it's like a
simulation digital twin but it will
be your your digital twin should not
only uh have the same let's say DNA that
you have and the same comorbidities but
it should live the same
lifestyle so if you eat a carrot your
digital twin should eat a carrot because
it's all part of the uh part of the did
you do enough did you exercise
apparently people Tak OIC the weight
loss drug they have far lower Alzheimer
risk so far I'm surprised they know that
because has that drug hasn't been around
that long but they say a 40 to 70%
reduction uh for people who have type 2
diabetes which apparently uh suggests
that you have a higher risk of uh
Alzheimer's too
well I don't know about you but I'm
starting to think that obesity is bad
for your health is anybody picking that
up how's your pattern
recognition so whenever people are
overweight it seems that there's a wide
variety of problems they have and some
of them include the brain oh how many
times do I tell you that your body is
your brain that's right if your body is
doing type two diabetes things instead
of what it should be doing your brain's
going to be
degraded so one of the smartest things I
did in my i' say late years is I decided
that my uh body and my brain were the
same thing and that if I exercised and a
right all of my life I could get to my
old age and my brain would still be
working here I am I'm old and my brain
is is still working so so far so good I
don't know what'll happen tomorrow but
today brain
working did you remember that V
ramaswami is the second biggest
shareholder now in uh the the septic
tank piece of crap called BuzzFeed
that's a online
publication now I did see a report that
he visited them and he's maybe trying to
convince them to have some conservative
writers I don't know if that's going to
happen but he's the second biggest
shareholder so he's an activist I would
think there's a good chance he'll get
what he wants um that was reported by
George on on the
xplatform and I would love to know what
vake has in has as a plan but I would
like to point out that it does seem that
traditional media is dead as a number of
smart people are saying the fact that
the Joe
Rogan broadcast with
Trump I think he did three hours and
he's got um last I checked 17 million
views K Harris went on the second
biggest podcast in the world and got
under
700,000 so 17
million in just a few days and you more
coming versus 700,000 which isn't bad
either but a lot of people are saying
that the traditional media the CNN's and
the msnbc's and the ABC News and CBS
that they're basically
done um and there's even thinking that
they should give up their they should
give up their Airwaves you know their
radio um what do you call it spectrum
that so there's something that the
traditional media should give up its
spectrum and you know what the reason is
the reason is that they don't serve the
public
anymore it's actually a good reason the
reason that the TV networks have I think
free uh you know they all get allocated
their own little spectrum that is rare
and I think I believe the reasoning is
that the public gets a benefit from
having the networks have this access
especially the news but now that the
news from the networks is really just
nothing but propaganda and we recognize
it as
such and the only place you can get
anything useful is from independent
journalists why exactly do these big
entities have free free uh you know free
asset from the
country the bandwidth and the what would
you call it the
Spectrum um if they're if they're
actually bad for the
country so you know you I'm not sure
they were ever good for the country but
um at the moment it's super super
obvious that the mainstream news is fake
news it's propaganda it's bad for the
country so why do they get free assets
to be bad for the
country because I think that's not even
controversial at this point even people
are mad at their own preferred sources
you know people are mad at uh the
Washington Post they're mad at the LA
Times they're mad at the
CNN um and they're they're mad at their
own side so it's not like we're arguing
that the mainstream media is good for
one side and bad for the other it's both
sides say hey what happened to you guys
you're worthless now um so we'll see
what V has has a in plan for
BuzzFeed if I were a younger man I would
say vake BuzzFeed needs a column
columnist like me but I'm
not
anyway do you think do you think mream
media is dead I think it's premature I
think people are actually you know a
little bit more wishful thinking I think
it's that but the reason that the
traditional media exists is not to make
money so you can't predict you can't
predict their fate based on economics
because they're clearly their propaganda
is obviously the purpose of them
and I don't see any reason that they'll
go away if if money isn't the reason
they exist in the first place and
propaganda is the reason they exist
they're not going to go away because
they're losing money and their
propaganda so I'm going to go I'm going
to go counter to the all the smart
people who are saying my goodness Joe
Rogan has made all the traditional
mainstream media
garbage eventually
yes but next year no next year will
exactly like this year yeah I mean you
know maybe 1%
difference um why is uh why is The Joe
Rogan thing better well lots of reasons
number one reason is that there's long
time period so so people are really you
know they've got all the Time in the
World to answer
questions um a podcaster such as Joe
Rogan has all the Time in the World to
follow up on a question there's nobody
sitting there talking over him now let
me compare that
to uh three episodes of
CNN so there were three separate Clips
just this morning about CNN and they all
had the same quality to them a
conservative tried to say something that
was both true and obvious and wellknown
and on point and the the Liberals and or
liberal who was there with them talked
over them so they couldn't
talk now that didn't happen on Joe Rogan
did
it what was anybody talking over anybody
didn't need to three hours but on I I
was watching Scott Jennings on CNN and
uh somebody mentioned the uh the
drinking bleach
hoax like it was real and Scott Jennings
says well you know that's a hoax and
suddenly five different p IST started
talking over him so that the audience
couldn't hear him say that it was a hoax
and I thought that is fascinating that's
something you don't see on on a podcast
you'll never see a podcast where
somebody is completely talked over to
the point where the topic changes and
then I watched there was another segment
where again the conservative got talked
over until the time changed and then I
watched Jake Tapper interviewing JD fit
JD Vance and that uh tapa was using the
the really play I've taught you the
really play it's where you don't have to
give an argument sometimes sometimes you
just say the thing that somebody
believes and you look at them and you go
really
really really that's what you believe
and it can be really good as a as a
persuasion thing if the
person would have trouble explaining why
that's really
what they
believe however it didn't work with JD
Vance because the question was why are
the all these ex um staffers of trump
now turning against him and uh Jake was
trying to make the point you know really
are you saying that all of these people
all of these people that turned against
Trump really they're really there
they're all bad you're saying there's
something wrong with all of these people
really and JD Vance looks at him he goes
yes and then he explains they're all
neocons and yes there's something wrong
with every one of
them now you could you could debate you
could debate the accuracy of that
statement you know are they all neocons
and there's something wrong with them
but they all have they all had some
reason to be mad at Trump they were
either fired by him or there's something
they didn't like about him or their
neocons or or something else
but the key point was that as JD tried
to explain his point of view Tapper just
kept talking over him so I watched three
different segments that were all really
interesting and I would have wanted to
see the actual exchange but I couldn't
because CNN wouldn't allow the person
they were talking to to
talk now did you see that even one time
on any conservative podcast that you've
watched
lately the the last time I saw it was a
um I I was watching also Megan Kelly
appear on um Bill marah show and I swear
he was talking over now because it's
Megan Kelly it's not your average person
she she didn't let him get away with
talking over him which is hard to do by
the way un unless you're really really
good at so at media getting talked over
is hard to get out of but you know Megan
Kelly is a force of nature so she does
but watching the uh it seems to me that
the the Democrat argument has turned
into I need to make sure you don't talk
have you noticed that so it started with
the Twitter files and trying to get the
social media to censor you it you know
the whole Nos and Soros funding them to
get the Europeans to shut you down cuz
they don't want conservatives to even
have a message but then when they invite
them on they talk over them I mean just
grossly talk over them so they can't say
a
thing now you could argue that same
thing happens if a you know if a if a
liberal goes on a uh conservative show
there might be the same thing but my
larger point is that the traditional
media is a talk over
media here's my summary traditional
media is about talking over somebody
until you run out of time nobody cares
about that I don't want to see anybody
talk over somebody until you're out of
time like
why what good is that so yeah
traditional media is uh completely
broken at this
point um Nicole Shanahan's uh video
Geniuses have another good one called
the big cheat so it's a campaign ad
again it's really really well done
whoever is making her videos is highly
talented but it's but it's called the
big cheat and you think it's going to be
about you know 2020 cheat but it's not
it's about
um it's about how Bernie Sanders was
cheated out of his place at the party it
was about how the 51 Intel chiefs were
cheating at the end of the election
about how Biden was dethroned and it was
about how comma was
installed and once you see how the
Democrats treat other
Democrats it's really hard to imagine
that the election itself is not rigged
because everything that the Democrats
are doing to themselves is
rigging I mean they're rigging each
other so to imagine that they would rig
each other right in front of the whole
world but not rig the election to
actually win it is kind of a stretch
it'd be kind of hard to
believe really really that they're not
not going to do anything uh
sketchy so uh there's more news on the
Washington Post not endorsing uh anybody
which is the a rare thing they normally
they normally endorse the Democrat and
there's some reporting that um maybe
Jeff bezos's reach some kind of a deal
with
Trump I'm not sure I'm ready to believe
that I would believe that if I heard it
from Bezos or from
Trump but I would believe it from
literally nobody else I don't want to
hear about somebody was in the room
somebody overheard a
conversation some anonymous source so I
don't trust anything about that story
but it seems to me that you don't need a
conversation between
Trump and Bezos for this to happen
here's why number one has Bezos been
active in politics so
far not really right I I I can't think
of Bezos doing anything overly
political his wife however which I'm
sure he's just really happy with did
take many billions of his dollars and
put them heavily into left leaning
things that he may not completely agree
with so you have to wonder and somebody
speculated this on X you you wonder if
this is marriage
related as in the the one way you could
really really bug your ex-wife who just
spent billions of your dollars on things
you didn't want to be spent
on could be it was just a big F you to
his
wife now he'd have he'd have plenty of
cover for why he'd have other reasons to
do it which is you should just stay out
of politics he doesn't want to get Bud
lighted doesn't want to get Target
stored doesn't want to get
Disney yes he has an absolute
responsibility that if you're a
conservative author you still want to
use Amazon if you're a liberal author
you still want to use Amazon if there
were one
person that really really really want to
not be involved in politics is Jeff
Bezos because he he's like the person
who can control what algorithm shows you
what books I mean that's way too much
power to come down hard on one side of
politics so Bezos being a
genius simply doing what smart people do
and stay out of it
now if you look at Elon Musk and you say
but but how can they both be smart
Geniuses when they're doing opposite
things I think if you look at what
elon's doing he's far
more um let's say far more willing to
take a
risk and I think he has he thinks
there's more at stake probably um so I
don't mind either opinion they they come
you know it looks like they're coming to
their decisions in different ways but
they're both
smart and uh I would respect both
those I think I respect that equally I I
respect Bezos staying out of Politics as
much as I appreciate musk getting into
politics because they don't seem to be
doing it in a dumb way they seem to be
doing it for what seems to be perfectly
good
reasons anyway can you believe the CNN
doesn't know the drink bleach hoax is a
hoax and they they sold both the host
and the guest argued with Scott Jennings
that the that the Trump did in fact say
drink
bleach how could you have a job in news
and think that happened in the real
world you know we we finally beat the
fine people hoax that that's now common
knowledge that that was a
hoax but the drinking bleach one oh my
God how anyone believes that Trump
suggested drinking bleach or even or
even injecting uh any kind of liquid
disinfectant if there's anybody new to
the feed the real story is he was
talking about light as an antiseptic he
started by talking light then he talked
about it and then he book ended it by
talking about light but the other
experts didn't know he was talking about
light or missed that point and they
talked about other things he never
talked about anything but light and so
light was actually being tried as a
as a disinfectant in your
trachea and a disinfectant potentially
in your lungs if they could stick a a
light source into your lungs and IR
radiate it with UV light that was the
idea and that was actively being tested
when Trump talked about
it and then the news turned it into
drinking bleach and then years later CNN
still reports It Like It's
News I mean you can't be more pathetic
than that
that's pathetic yeah it's just
pathetic
anyway um Jack babic has a scoop that
White House insiders are saying that
Biden is telling advisers the election
is dead and buried and commas and and N
sucker and well he's not
happy now remember I always tell you
that you can't believe um Anonymous
insiders in the White House
all right so you can't believe it when
they say something about Trump you can't
believe it when they say something about
Harris and you can't believe it when
they say something about Biden it's just
a general rule one Anonymous Insider is
like nothing happened
but it isn't hard to
imagine that Joe Biden is having a hard
time with
this you you can't really think of any
scenario in which he's okay with
it you also can't think of any scenario
in which Biden wouldn't be talking about
it you know he's not going to be quiet
about it and he probably wants her to
lose because honestly if if I were
running for president and I got
replaced I would want my replacement to
lose so that I could always say you know
yeah I get I was a little behind in the
polls but I had a chance of coming back
you replaced with an idiot I mean she's
sort of a
so then uh I saw a image that I think is
real but I saw some people questioning
it that the teleprompter for the Kam
Harris rally and I think the
teleprompter was for
Beyonce um showed how to pronounce kamla
phonetically as in the word comma Dash
law now I think that's important because
so many of her supporters can't say her
name right and they've already come down
on the point that if you can't say her
name right you're probably a racist or a
sexist but it turns out that one of her
big supporters Bruce Springstein also
known as the boss calls her
Cala so do at least half of the black
supporters that they they that anybody
talks to on the street a as do maybe
25% of one of the supporters of hers
that that shows up on MSNBC or
CNBC so so the Harris people start out
with this if if you don't say your name
right you're obviously a bad person and
you're doing it intentionally so Trump
instead of you know conforming because
he's not a
conformer you know he doubles down and
and and goes with full
Cala and then a lot of the a lot of his
Sur gets and stuff they go full Cala
and and so they've got this thing they
can do oh they would never do that with
somebody else they're only doing it
because because they're racist that's
why they use her name wrong and then the
number of times that her own supporters
pronounce your name wrong it's getting
hard to
ignore I mean Bruce Springstein on stage
endorsing her doesn't know her name
she's being endorsed by people who don't
know her name like actually don't know
it because when they try to say it
that's not actually her
name the minimum requirement for
endorsing somebody for president of the
United States should be you know their
name just to make us feel like you've
done a little bit of work so let's let's
look at how the two campaigns are doing
let's
see uh today uhe uh ex president Trump
will be in Madison Square Garden going
into the enemy sort of an unfriendly
territory um in the sense that Democrats
usually win New York but Trump has been
in the past highly popular in New York
more popular now than he's ever been
since he's been running for president
he'll probably sell out as well as
having a lot of Street action around it
it's going to be this enormous enormous
event and the visuals are going to be
insane because it'll be such a big event
and so much action so much energy and
let's see what KL Harris is doing uh we
have some video of her at a bar with
Gretchen Whitmer drinking beer and
cackling okay we must we must admit that
Comm Harris's campaign hates her
guts
because if your candidate look like a
drunk and she was a
cackler you would not have her seen in a
bar what ever you did you would keep her
as far away from a drink in as bar as
you possibly could and they put her in a
bar and they put a drink in her
hand oh my
God now I'm not exactly some you know
political expert consultant
but uh am I wrong that that was the
mistake of the
week can we conclude that Trump wins uh
today's competition now I think the bar
was last night in the you know Madison
Square Garden will be today
but that's a bad 24
hours the only thing I
remember is she was drinking and
cackling and that Beyonce came Beyonce
had to be paid a huge amount to Endor
her and didn't sing and made everybody
mad because they thought be was going to
sing and then Michelle Obama shows up
and what was wrong with Michelle
Obama did she have an
allergy did she just get done doing
lines of
coke what was wrong with her there's
something wrong with her but I don't
know what it was I mean it could just be
a health related but she gets up and she
tells women
um to uh she says women have every right
to demand the men in our lives do better
by
us um that's exactly what you didn't
need you didn't really really need
screechy Michelle Obama to be added to
screechy Kamala to be added to screechy
Hillary Clinton to tell us that all the
screechy women think men
suck we get it
we get it you hate our guts we
get it but we have somebody we can vote
for so we can just go our separate ways
so
men the the W the women in the Democrat
Party genuinely don't like you I mean
they really really don't like
you if you don't believe me would you
believe van Jones
because van Jones said uh this yesterday
I
think quote if progressives have uh a
politics that says all white people are
racist all men are toxic and all
billionaires are evil it's kind of hard
to keep them on our side if you're
chasing people out of the party you
can't be mad when they
leave H let me read that again because
he said it so well vanan Jones said this
on see then if progressives have
politics that says all white people are
racist all men are toxic and all
billionaires are evil it's kind of hard
to keep them on your side if you're
chasing away you can't be mad when they
leave you know I feel like they were mad
when I
left
CU I kind of said the same thing when I
got
cancelled I kind of
said that if you're going to say all
white people are racist then I don't
want to have any association with you
and I got cancelled
worldwide interesting
fact in the depth of my
cancellation there were some
people who supported
me some privately some
publicly do you know one of the people
who supported me
privately van Jones
he actually called me and said what the
hell is this all about and then I told
him and he listened you know wished I
had not worded it that way was was not
supportive of my message whatsoever just
just to be clear he was not supportive
of what I
said but he was supportive of
me personally and said in in direct
language I don't think you're
racist but didn't love what I said now
that's all I wanted that's all I wanted
I didn't want him to love what I said
so
um he's a voice of reason listen to him
he he knows that the Democrats are
chasing people like me away and didn't
need to I mean I was basically Democrat
leading all of my adult life I got
chased away I mean I I ran from the
people who said well we don't like you
maybe a little less of you would be
great and I said fine how about less of
me works for me too I reached my
limit so that's why if you if you wonder
why I say good things about van Jones is
because I think he sees the whole
field and uh it's okay to be partisan
partisan is okay you know everybody's
partisan but
uh he can see the whole field
all right and I appreciate him here's
something kim.com posted today about
paying off the national
debt now before I tell you this I should
uh remind you in the most obnoxious way
so you're sick of hearing it I do have a
degree in economics and I have an MBA
from a top
school I should be able to understand
what kim.com says about paying off the
debt I do not
not even close but I want to see if you
do or or at very least can we agree that
nobody has any idea how to pay off the
national debt all right so here's what
kim.com says now and by the way I'm not
saying he's
wrong I I have questions I don't know
would this work I don't see how it would
he goes uh the only way out about the
national debt is to print 40 trillion
settle all debt use gold reserves to get
Americans through
hyperinflation and issue a new digital
currency with limited Supply and no Mass
surveillance abolish the fed and ban all
interest on loans a bit of pain but
problem
solved um
question if you printed 40
trillion uh that would make cash
worthless but you'd use your gold
Reserve to get Americans through that
hyperinflation how do you do that how
would you use your gold
reserves would you do
what uh give everybody a little
gold back the dollar with
gold what does that even mean to use our
gold reserves to get get us through the
hyperinflation and then how would
issuing a new digital currency with
limited Supply help us
because that would in addition to the 40
trillion we would be adding a new form
of money on top of the 40 trillion so
our hyperinflation should go into hypert
turbo extra
hyperinflation wouldn't
it um abolish the fed I'm not sure how
that's
exactly related to all of that um and
then ban all interest on loans
how could you have a functioning economy
if you Bann interest on
loans what's the alternative to that and
again there might be an alternative to
that because remember I'm starting with
the assumption that kim.com is very
smart because you know that's my
impression of him so if he's very smart
and he's saying stuff I don't understand
I don't automatically assume the
problems on his
end so I'm curious enough about it is
there is there enough to what he's
saying that other people are saying yes
yes I know exactly what he
means or is it just several Concepts in
the same place that don't fit
together I don't
know
um I do think the only way we can
survive the national debt is if Elon
Musk can immediately cut spending so
that we get that part under control and
that we we increase our growth rate
beyond anything we've seen before both
are possible and both of them will
require Elon
Musk you're going to need Elon Musk for
all of it because the growth will
require robots and Ai and electric cars
and self-driving cabs and maybe
spaceships so it's kind of on him you
know he's got a lot going on for the
future um so he he would be the one
behind the growth at least a lot of it
and then he would also be the one behind
cutting the
costs uh to me it's
unbelievable that this election is
close now I get how people say oh Trump
Trump trump this but how do they explain
that RFK Jr
musk V you know
tulsy I could go
on how do how do Democrats explain
that they haven't noticed that Trump is
Hitler and that they think he has the
best economic and practical plan for
solving problems how did they explain
that I would just love to spend some
time saying but do you think RFK Jr
couldn't spot
Hitler well no he's got some he's some
interest blah blah blah well okay but
you know Israel likes Trump right
yeah and you know that Israel is really
good as spotting
Hitlers they're really good at
it yeah and you know the Israel likes
Trump so much they named a town after
him uh he's
Hitler okay I don't think you're hearing
what I'm
saying anyway so um
the pretended war between Israel and
Iran has uh gone to its logical
conclusion so Israel instead of uh doing
something that would
increase um the chance of response they
did something that would decrease the
chance of
response now the level of
intelligence that Israel is bringing to
this
fight I I'm getting tired of compliment
ing them you know from the the pager
thing to pretty much everything yeah at
least at least since the poor defense of
the Gaza situation that was
suboptimal but uh the way they've
pressed the war is really
impressive
and so they of course they had to attack
Iran because Iran did the massive 200
missile strike he can't let that
go but they managed to as far as I know
kill zero
people is that right I I think the death
toll was Zero of a fairly
massive completely controlling the
airspace over Iran didn't lose a single
asset um and destroyed all of
practically all of Iran's air
defenses so the first thing Israel did
was show that show Iran and this is the
important part that they could easily
destroy Iran's entire air defense
if you destroy their entire air
defense can Iran win a
war well' be kind of
hard Iran has also demonstrated that
even a massive missile
attack they can basically shoot down
enough that they were largely
unscathed so now now Iran has the
following knowledge that it did not have
before number one if your proxies go
after after us we will not just shoot
back we will destroy the entire country
that they're
in that would be
Gaza
and and if you think hezb is going to be
safe not so much we're going to blow up
every one of their leaders we're going
to keep trimming their leaders for as
long as it takes and we're going to blow
up every military asset that they have
in their country no matter how long it
takes so that's
new so then they prove that Ran's
missiles aren't going to work and then
they prove that Iran has no defense
because they don't have any air defense
Israel took it out in one
day I think that was the big story the
big story is you see we're up here right
we're now above your entire country
there's nothing you can do to shoot us
down do you want to do you want to keep
this
up pretty good
but the the thing that's amazing about
this is the the level
of Civility that got into war right war
is normally more like you know Gaza it's
it's messy and civilians are dying but
somehow two countries made a deal to do
a fake
war and then they fought it and and it
was conclusive because it's telling Iran
okay I guess I'm not going to you know
make this a bigger war and uh some think
that uh maybe Israel reduced their
ability to make more rockets for another
year or
so but here's what it almost feels like
and I always use this yeah it feels like
an old Star Trek episode but here's what
they could have done both sides could
have created a fake army
base and tell the other side it's fake
say hey Iran we're going to build this
army base it's going to be completely
fake the f-35s going to put on it our
cardboard and but we are going to put
our best defense so the missile defense
uh is going to be our best stuff but the
things on the ground are just cardboard
and plastic and you know just looks like
a base we'd like you to build one
too uh what why would we build a fake
base trust us just build a fake base
just like ours but do put your best
defense so make sure that you have real
rocket defenses but the base itself
should be fake why do you want it to be
fake well we don't want to hurt
anybody we we simply need to every now
and then compare our
Technologies so here's what's going to
happen you attack our fake base and
we'll try to shoot down as many your
drones and missiles as we can then we'll
see how you
did okay all right two got through not
much damage what did you learn well we
learned that if this had been a real
base that we also would not have damaged
anything exactly exactly now in a couple
days when we're ready we'll let you know
when but we're going to attack your fake
base and make make sure you got lots of
cardboard planes there because we really
want to make this a good test all right
we have many cardboard planes yeah but
but use real real defense all right your
defense against our military and our our
planes that should be real yes it'll be
totally
real how'd you do oh
we lost 100% of our anti-aircraft
defense okay Iran what have you learned
okay well we learned that when we attack
you we don't really blow up anything you
just blow our our bombs out of the
sky and then what else did you learn
Iran okay we
learned that anytime you want to you can
knock out all of our air defenses and
we're helpless and then you can pick us
all off exactly so what should we do
about
this well same as we were doing before
no
no maybe we should fund
Hezbollah less that's it that's it fund
Hezbollah
less yes do that because if we have to
blow up another one of your fake bases
we'll do it we'll do it oh yeah well if
you blow up another one of our fake
bases we're going to send missiles at
your fake bases that you'll shoot out of
the sky before they even reach the
ground so that's the kind of War I want
I want a war where nobody gets hurt
there wasn't really any chance anybody
would it's all very civilized and when
you're done you've learned something
really important you've learned if you
 with Israel they're going to mow
your lawn and you're the lawn on and if
you take it to the next level you're
really really going to be
sorry message
learned and that ladies and
gentlemen is all I had to say today
because uh we're coming into the final
uh final
turn let's see from let's see on Tuesday
it'll be one week from election
day and uh
how do you feel about the
polls so as you expected there will be
enough polls that say it's a tie that
cheating is completely on the
table we do know that there are so many
reports of irregularities I don't know
how many are true and how many are not
that uh there's no way that the public
can trust the outcome of the election
and we know that our politicians uh on
the losing side will tell us that the
election was riged doesn't matter which
side
loses now I did see Bill Maher and I've
seen some other people argue that
January 6 is still the big problem and
you know Trump tried to over turn the
country or take over the country here's
my best short argument for that number
one what day was the peaceful transfer
of power scheduled to take place
um January 20th right is it 20th or 21st
the the actual transfer day give me a
fact check it's like January 20th or
21st I
forget but that's the day of the the
peaceful
transfer was there a peaceful
transfer yes yes there was on the day
that it was
planned what the Democrats keep doing is
conflating January 20th with January 6
January 6 is when our system allows you
to still argue about who
won do you know why they allow you to
argue about who
won because we have courts and we have
free speech if you have free speech and
you have courts all of that time between
election day and January 20 it's fair
game you can protest you can complain
you can demand audits you can uh take
things to court you can fight as hard as
you want to fight you know in the
political sense not the physical sense
and there's nothing wrong with any of
that now did some people take it to
violence yes do both sides wish that
that didn't happen yes were they
representative of the larger amount of
the crowd no not even close less than
one fewer than 1% of the people there
did anything violent so that and and
there's no evidence that that the mass
part of the crowd had any plans to do
anything violent they just didn't like
the election outcome so the first thing
you got to know is that everything Trump
did if he believed the election was
real was very
bad and that's where that's where the
Democrats start they start with the
assumption that Trump knew the election
was lost on his
part that's not just wrong it's stupid
and we've been allowing them to do that
stupid thing for four years and I've not
seen one person say oh hold on you're
starting stupid so we we don't need to
talk about the rest if your base
assumption is that somehow the country
could know if the election was rigged or
not and that somehow you believe that
Trump um is not like half of the country
that believes it was rigged in what way
would you imagine that he doesn't know
or doesn't believe it was rigged when I
believe it was rigged I do half of the
country believes it was rigged I believe
all of our elections have been rigged at
least in my
lifetime and I and I believe that the
way our system is designed it's for the
purpose of
ragging because if you want to do it for
the purpose of keeping it honest it
would look completely different and
everybody knows
that so every time I see somebody get in
a conversation about January 6 they let
the bad guys um make them think past the
sale the sale is what did the protesters
and Trump believe about the election if
they genuinely believed it was rigged
and it was obvious it was rigged
everything they did was
appropriate that's
it and then you say but but violence and
I
say I don't care
because if it was
rigged and 99% of the people were
nonviolent but 1%
were that's just the way the world works
you I'm not in favor of violence I'm
just saying that if you rig an election
right in front of the public expect some
violence expect some violence if you rig
it right in front of the public now I'm
not saying it was rigged because I don't
have you know proof of that I'm saying
that it was designed for the purpose of
rigging and it has every Hallmark of
being rigged and every election I've
been involved with probably was rigged
and if the elections are the only things
that can't be rigged and aren't be
rigged in the United States and every
other institution and major organization
from Health Care to finance to
everything else is so obviously
rigged if you believe this is the one
thing that's not when it is the most
rigal thing that we've ever had in this
country
you're not a smart
player you you're just not putting much
brain power into the into the
conversation so those are the key points
don't let anybody
assume that anybody knew the election
was good because that was just not the
case I I've never talked to anybody that
was involved with a protest who thought
that Trump actually
lost have you have you ever spoken to
one person even one just one because
there were like 20,000 people there it
was a big number just even one person
who said I protested but you know
honestly I thought Trump lost fair and
square even
one if you can't find one person in that
entire
crowd who believed Trump lost why do you
think Trump believed it
of course he thinks he won of course he
does and imagine what he's seen that you
haven't
seen can you imagine how much stuff you
see when you're president whe When you
find out like what the CIA has really
been doing so suppose you knew that your
country had overthrown 80 other
countries I think we did like 80 coup
attempts I don't know how many of the
80s succeeded but let's say 60 and of
the 80s succeeded
if you knew for
sure that we could overthrow countries
and get away with it and not get caught
how would you think it wouldn't happen
in our
country in in in what world would they
not apply the same skills to control
this country and you listen to the
Democrats like K Lis and they'll say it
out loud they'll say out loud that you
know we can't allow the Free Speech if
you can't allow the free speech you also
can't allow free
elections you know that's the same thing
right if if you say that uh as Harris
does that uh Elon mus is a bad person
because he lets people say whatever they
want on social
media if you can't have free speech you
can't have free elections like you
couldn't possibly be in favor of free
elections if the person running isn't
allowed to
talk the the people running should be
allowed to talk and obviously she would
have she would censor them if she said
things that her side said were not true
so K Harris
wants you know like on paper she'd say
yes anybody can run for office but she
would want one of those people to be
uncensored and the other to be censored
because it disagreed with their
party it sounds like I'm making that up
but she says that out loud yeah so what
would would be the point of running for
office if the things you said could be
censored by the other
side she's pretty much telling you she
doesn't want elections or at least not
real ones but maybe that's not so
different than how it's been all right
I'm going to go talk to the uh locals
people privately and if you're on X or
YouTube or Rumble thanks for
joining um I will remind you that on
Monday that would be tomorrow I'll be
appearing on The Young Turks talking to
Jen on Monday I guess the show starts at
800m Eastern
time um so that's 5:00 P PM my
time and uh I think actually you might
be surprised by the outcome of
that um and the prediction is just
because Jen is genuinely
interesting and he's genuinely
Brave and if you put those two together
interesting and
brave and then you throw me into the
mix because I got nothing to lose
um and both of us I think both of us
would want to create something of value
like you know if if we're just yelling
at each other you neither of us is going
to be happy about that so I think I
think there is some chance
will uh you maybe move the needle or at
least be interesting enough that you'll
want to watch it so I recommend it in
advance all right everybody and remember
