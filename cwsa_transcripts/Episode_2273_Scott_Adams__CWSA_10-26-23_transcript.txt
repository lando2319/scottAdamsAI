good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization and
it's not really hard to be the highlight
these days cuz human civilization not
doing so well but we're doing great here
and if you'd like to take it up to a
level that's almost impossible to
imagine all you need is a cuper mug or a
glass a tanker chel orstein a canteen
jugg or flaska vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine h of
the day thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go pretty good pretty
good well I'm going to start with the
most important stories of the day and
then we'll work toward everything
else most important story of the day the
newest member of what they call the
squad the progressives uh in um in the
house their newest member uh they made a
big mistake they accepted a a
man so that the squad was sort of women
and then they decided it was a big
mistake they let a man in first thing
the man does when he becomes a member of
the squad he pulls a fire alarm in front
of security cameras to uh possibly delay
a government
action I don't
know what the rest of the squad is
thinking about their newest
member but I've Got a Feeling there's a
lot of head slapping you know you you
could probably hear five slaps as soon
as that news came out it's
like you know you'd hear like like five
slaps in Congress what were those I hear
five slaps where's that coming from
sorry Squad you own him
now all
right uh yesterday a few of you already
know from my man cave last night that uh
I joined a spaces event an audio event
on the
xplatform and if you're not familiar
with it it's a audio thing where there
number of people are hosts and speakers
and then you could volunteer to speak
but mostly it's audience members it's
just people who are you know they show
up as being audience members and uh I
joined one that was a bunch of people
were really mad at hotep Jesus
it looked like it was uh mostly black
Americans who were angry at things that
hotep Jesus had said on the Joe
Rogan uh
podcast I think the main topic
was that and I don't know what's True by
the way I'm just going to tell you what
they were arguing about It's the
funniest thing I've ever seen in my
life apparently hotep made and I hope
I'm representing him correctly
apparently hotep Jesus uh made the claim
on Joe Rogan that the early settlers or
at least the royal family of Hawaii
prior to Hawaii ever being part of the
America situation in his early days the
uh maybe the first king of Hawaii was
black and I said to myself
what that can't be true and of course
that's what the uh all of the people on
the spaces were saying it was number of
black people were saying why are you why
are you embarrassing Us by making us
look so bad that you would make crazy
claims that black people were early sers
of the United States and that crazy
crazy that the prior King some king of
Hawaii had been black that's pretty
crazy so I get into that spaces and I'm
just listening I'm not I'm not going to
be participating and I think to myself
well that does sound crazy that's pretty
damn crazy
so then I Googled the name of the king
that hot
mentioned I'm looking at the photo and
I'm saying myself and and his entire
family is there too so you can see the
whole royal family I'm looking at it and
I'm
thinking okay definitely not
Hawaiian definitely not
Hawaiian looks black to me now I think
there's some you know discussion about
exactly what their ethnicity was but
they do look you know if you were an
American looking at their photos in 2023
you wouldn't imagine there were anything
but
black
and and it's it's quite an eye opener
because maybe we don't know much about
the migration of people and the origins
of anything you know if there's anything
we've learned is that we don't know
anything about anything you know there
there's nothing that we know is true
like take the big bang you know the Big
Bang was basically a gospel my entire
life and then this year it's like you
know maybe not you know our new our new
telescope is Maybe not maybe not but and
I wonder if some of the most basic
things we think about you know the
migration Out of Africa and who went
where when and who settled what and you
know was it was it the Vikings or was it
Christopher Columbus we might be wrong
about all of
that if our understanding of history is
as poor as our understanding of the
moment we're alive you know with the
greatest ability to know what's true and
compare it to things we've ever had and
we still don't know what's true imagine
the history of today being written who
gets to write the history of
today because we don't agree at all
what's happening right now we don't
agree we don't agree at all what
happened on January 6
2020 who who gets to write that history
so who says
that the first settlers or maybe the
royal family of Hawaii was not at one
time
black the pictures would suggest that's
true now again I'm not taking sides I
don't know what's true my larger point
is we just can be fooled by anything
basically so who knows what's true it
was just a fascinating discussion but
that's not why I brought it up I brought
it up because when the host noticed that
I was uh an audience member they decided
to call me out for being removed from
the
platform uh because I'm such a big
racist and then they said just to prove
that they were on the side of the good
they wanted to make sure that they were
you know showing they were better than
me they wanted to get rid of me for my
supposed racist past but then just to
make the point I guess a little stronger
they announced that they would be
getting rid of everybody white so if
they saw any white profiles in the
spaces which is a public
event by his nature it's a public event
they decided to get rid of all the white
observers so the white audience members
were
deleted and this morning at least one of
the participants saw me tweeting about
it maybe as participant maybe not and
wanted to uh embarrass me on X by
showing exactly why I got cancelled and
quoted my actual quote
what about that they said yeah gotcha to
which I responded and I'm
paraphrasing um this is what I was
talking
about that black people can discriminate
openly against white people with no
there's no penalty at all so what they
did to me on Spaces but more importantly
what they did to the other people who
just happen to be white at the same
time they discriminated against them
directly they said it we're getting rid
of you because you're white and we were
only audience members we were not
participants just audience members in a
public
event now that is exactly my point my
point is they could have walked over and
beaten the out of
me and people wouldn't have blinked
twice it' be like I probably had it
coming I bet you had it coming yeah
we're in a weird place now
but I love winning uh winning that hard
it's like um the thing you're mocking me
for is my point not
yours all right now you're mocking me
again that's my point okay now you're
still mocking me that's my
point you can't win harder than that and
still
lose all right well we've got a new
Speaker of the House Mike Johnson uh who
I also like to lovingly call a
idiot
oh my God this guy's a idiot I'm
sorry I can't even be objective about
this at all has nothing to do with the
Republican or Democrat or anything
 idiot first of all he's got long
history of being super
anti-gay now I don't know if he's
changed since the mid
2000s but how in the world you have a
 anti-gay guy in 2023 who's The
Speaker of the House Jesus Christ are
you kidding
me now now maybe maybe he had some you
know Reawakening or something maybe he's
not the same guy he was 10 years ago but
man if you see some of his writing he is
super
anti-gay and not in a way that is
compatible with our current times but
more to the point I saw a video of him
saying that he has a particular problem
at home he has two teenage Sons uh one
of them is black and one of them is is
white and he says that he feels bad
because he has to counsel his black teen
that he will be more heavily
discriminated
against what what kind of terrible
parenting is that in
2023 he's going to tell the he's going
to tell his two sons that the black one
is going to be discriminated
against what country does he live in how
about you take those two kids
give them identical uh educ
identical skills and have them apply for
the same
College you you
you're you're raising your kids wrong
clearly but you're making the world a
worst place by saying it in public no
the black kid will get into the college
with the same uh same qualifications way
faster now have him go apply for a God
damn job you in
2023 black gets the job every
time every time he is so
unqualified to be even in Congress much
less the speaker I've never been more
disappointed with anything completely
disqualified piece of America in
2023 we don't need your
backwards views about I mean he's he's
like what 40 years he's it's like he's
living 40 years in the
past it's been at least 30 years that
the black guy could get a job easier
than the white guy in Corporate America
and I know that cuz I was in Corporate
America and lost two jobs for being
white which I've talked about all the
time he's only 40 years old so he hasn't
learned a thing in his entire
life it looks like sorry didn't mean to
swear so
much uh let's talk about uh dumb
kids um there's a shocking
survey uh about K through2 and which
kids were asked
uh uh what what they knew about the uh
number of Jews killed in Holocaust and
63% of us kids oh actually not even kids
Jesus uh this is adults 18 to39 63% of
us people 18 to39 were unaware that 6
million Jews were killed in the
Holocaust 23 % said the Holocaust was a
myth exaggerated or they weren't quite
sure so you telling me about a quarter
of the
people weren't even sure the Holocaust
happened about
25% was 23 but rounding you know yeah
well that's consistent at least um 11%
said Jews caused the Holocaust oh my God
including 19% of respondents in in New
York what 19% of New Yorkers saw Jews
caused the
Holocaust what am I reading that
right
probably and 48% could not name a single
concentration camp or ghetto from World
War II who could who can name a ghetto
can any of you name a Jewish ghetto from
World War
II
Warsaw or so was called a Jewish ghetto
instead of
just what okay well you guys are pretty
well um educated here is my take number
one how much do we know about any other
ethnic
group I know yeah I don't think this
level of um lack of knowledge is out of
it's out of whack with or lack of
knowledge of everything else it's more
of a general lack of of knowledge so
here's a question I've told you this
before I think um for years I've been
asking young people the following
question how many people do you think
died in World War II counting military
and civilians of all the nations
involved and then people go oh I don't
know I don't really know well take your
best guess you know based on your your
sense of things you know your education
what do you think I mean it was a World
War give me a number I've had numbers as
low as
10,000 I've had people who are like
people who will vote these are people
who probably are voting by now and they
said ah around 10,000 worldwide military
and uh about 10,000 I've had other
people who will say 6 million because
they they confused the Jewish uh deaths
with the entire War if I had other
people try to give me a big number and
they'll be
like it could be 10
million yeah it's closer to 60
million you know I don't I don't know if
we can get anywhere near the real number
but you it's in the neighborhood of 60
million if you didn't know
that I see some higher estimates just to
just to show you how how loose the
estimates are but somewhere north of 50
million and if you don't know
that World War II killed 50 million
people would you be afraid of another
one I
wouldn't if I thought that World War II
only killed 10 10,000 people
worldwide I wouldn't even think about
World War I wouldn't even be on my
mind well so that's how dumb those kids
are and then there's another study or
report anyway managers are saying that
the gend zers uh they're AR not getting
any work done and they lack basic skills
or basic social skills as well as basic
skills now I was comparing the youth
today to the youth in my
day Le get off my lawn you youngsters
who can't do things like we used to be
able to do now of course I think old
people always said young people weren't
as good as they were that seems like
Universal and all through time so
there's some of that but there's also
something that I think is real about
this which is when I look at my
childhood I probably just just before I
was 18 years
old I probably
held I don't know I probably did 10
different jobs that you would normally
only have an adult
do right because I did
gardening and currently only adults are
doing gardening where I live right I was
mowing Lawns and stuff I was doing
farming you know I'm 12 years old and
I'm doing
farming my uncle's farm so I'm you know
I'm throwing hay bals around and
shoveling poop and helping with the milk
in or whatever I'm doing sapping you
know collecting sap from Maple
trees uh I mean shoveling snow I mean
just a lot of things that kids can do
but typically adults would do them so by
the by the time I got to college I'm
doing about four jobs in college you
know while I'm supporting myself at
least supporting some of my expenses
College was a lot cheaper back then so
you didn't have to have as much uh as
much uh investment in it
and by the time I reached the real world
Workforce I had already
held 15 adult jobs you know they they
were all little bits at a time but I'd
worked at a resort in I don't know six
different capacities I'd worked in the
kitchen I'd done uh the front desk work
i' you know I'd wash dishes I've been a
server you know i' done all these things
and every one of them is a job that
typically an adult is doing today and I
thought that by the time I reached my
first real job I was trained sort of
like an adult I mean I just I was given
responsibilities that by today's
standards you sort of wouldn't give a
kid and I don't remember blinking twice
about it it was just normal so I do
think the kids today are just simply not
doing as many things they're most of the
things they do are on a
device but when as soon as they stand up
and start walking around they're kind of
just in their house or in their school
or in a
car and the LI the number of things that
they have to navigate or figure out is
really really small small like their
their life is just shrunken to this
little experience but our you know in in
in many of our days we were Outdoors
solving problems like physically moving
and solving problems and of course the
phones make everybody depressed partly
because they don't move
around all right so yeah that's probably
a
difference but the good news is that
these kids dumb as they are they
eventually grow up to be wise and useful
members of society for example there are
quite a number of people in our Congress
who uh are very pro-israel and are
supporting the Jews you know 100% And as
do I and that's good because it means
that they've grown up to take on you
know serious issues and and be leaders
and really leaders of the country in
some ways even the world uh so what they
believe just just to give you some
details is that they believe Israel
should be protected and in part because
it's part of uh their belief in the
Rapture so so this is not everybody in
Congress but many of the uh conservative
Christians believe that uh uh Jesus will
come back and he will raise up the dead
so the dead Christians and then he will
take the living Christians who believe
in Jesus and they will go up to
heaven um everybody else will not go so
in a sense um if I can just recap this
just sort of The quick summary so the
conservative Christians believe that
it's very
important um in bibl in a Biblical
predictive sense that they protect
Israel because apparently Israel has to
be there uh as part of the Jesus coming
back so the uh so the Christian s in
Congress and some of the conservative
ones are very very pro-israel because
it's in part not just an American
interest you know
geopolitically but it it supports their
view that we should do everything we can
to help the Jewish people until uh Jesus
comes and Slaughters them all in a in a
more appropriate way so they're very
much against uh all the death and bad
things that have happened to the Jews uh
but they're very much up for or uh Jesus
coming down and killing everybody who
isn't a believer in Christ did I get
that
right I'm not I'm not a religious
scholar but I think I got that right
no so I I'm getting I'm getting
different opinions on this well let's
see which one is which part is
wrong uh I'll just do the individual
Parts CU I probably just got one part
wrong so one part is the the Christ
Christians who believe in the Rapture
the ones who believe in the Rapture uh
Israel is important to the whole the
scheme right right and they're also very
Pro protecting the Jewish people that's
true very supportive of Israel but they
also believe that anybody who doesn't
believe in
Jesus Will Will perish in the Rapture is
that and will never be part of heaven
will they go to hell so this is a part I
don't know will the people who are not
part of the Rapture do they go to hell
I'm seeing yeses and NOS some say yes on
hell some say
no right well my understanding
was that the conservative Christians
want to protect Israel until Jesus can
come and slay everybody who's not a
Believer and uh Doom them to uh eternal
hell
now I'm just asking if if I have a right
I'm not I'm not giving you an opinion of
what's true I don't know what's true and
what's not true I'm just asking you is
that their belief I'm getting a lot of
NOS but I don't give a
reason it's a different interpretation
all right well I guess I'm not a
religious scholar but the point is that
our dumb kids grow up to be uh smart
like that now not only that but some of
them become Mass Shooters like this guy
in Main so yesterday if you were
watching the news and I wish it weren't
uh some Mass shooter
guy it ran around and killed at least 16
last night they were saying 22 but it
might be 16 and he took a rifle and went
into at least a couple of places in
Maine and shot people up now they did
fairly quickly get an identification
very impressive work because as I said
oh
wow uh
as I
said uh see I want to just show you this
picture in case he's running around your
neighborhood so they got this good
picture of
him here you've got uh you can see the
still picture he's looking directly at
you and then you can see a completely
different person that they've identified
as being the same uh in the video so
what of them had a nose job uh to
lengthen his nose apparently before he
did the shooting uh his his face shape
was changed to something
skinnier um but uh he's a person of
interest now as I was watching the news
last night I I saw that they had
so-called identified him and they even
had his name and then they compared him
to the video that I was looking at and I
said to
myself that's not the same guy
there there's no way that's the same
guy now I understand it's a different
angle but that didn't change the CH the
shape of his
face
so I was listening to the uh news and
the news said he's a person of interest
and he wanted to make really sure that
he was a person of interest and not a
suspect do you notice the difference
between a suspect and a person of
interest I either but I think it's you
call him a suspect if you're sure of the
identity and you're sure of the
crime you're still not saying he's
guilty be like well this is the guy he's
on video and he's here so suspect I
think you say Person of Interest when
you're not so sure about your
identification now it turns out they
can't find him but the the guy who they
think did the shooting was a weapons
expert of course he was a apparently a
uh some kind of firearms trainer so he
had military experience and he was a
Firearms trainer worst situation ever
and apparently brutally evily efficient
that taking people
out
um how often do you think this happens
where the the person they think it is
doesn't match the video I going to tell
you a story about my for my own
experience when I was a bank teller at
the age of 22 is I guess I was robbed a
few times at at gunpoint one of the
people who who robbed me at
gunpoint um looked like this guy he he
he had some facial hair he looked like
about that height and build brown hair
kind of looked like that guy but when
the FBI came in and said all right now
describe the guy who robbed you I
described a guy who looked well like the
guy in the picture like a different guy
in fact the one I saw looked 30 years
older uh had gray hair and not much of
it a little beard stubble but not a
beard and uh different
clothing I described a guy who in no way
matched the person on video who actually
robbed me the way I found that out is
the FBI visited me a second time which
is never good to find out if I was in on
the
crime I think you know in retrospect
they they never said that but in
retrospect they said um can you describe
that guy again and I describe him and
then they said um could you come with
us and I thought what yeah we'd like to
show you something at our
office
what so they take me to the office
office and and they've got this uh
machine where they can replay the video
from the uh the video cameras of the
robbery and so it had a it had a manual
crank on it I remember so they could
really slow it down frame by frame and
they start cranking it and they go is
this the guy who robbed you and they
show a guy who looks very much like the
guy in the video see he look like a
young Clint
Eastwood with a sport
jacket I had described a 60-year-old guy
with some stubble and like a long coat
different color everything so they so I
see this guy looking like Clint Eastwood
walking through the bank and they go is
this this is is this the guy who robbed
you I'm like no not even close and they
go watch this and they go slowly and
they crank it and I watch the guy walk
up to my
thing pull a gun on me and watch me
handing him over my cash and I'm
watching it I'm
like
what I was
there I look right in his
face and and you know when somebody put
aims a gut at you I don't know how many
times people have aimed guns at you I'm
up to
three I I've been under the gun three
times in my life all in San Francisco um
but you see you remember indeed the
second time I got robbed I also ended up
going to a police
lineup and as soon as I saw the lineup I
was like oh yeah him like easy to
remember and that guy put the gun right
in my face like the second guy that I
easily identified looked exactly like I
remembered him he literally had a gun in
my nose I was looking down the barrel of
it while while I gave him the
money
and so one of them I remember perfectly
but it gets weird
here's the weird part remember how I
said the first one I described
completely differently than the
video
separately the FBI interviewed my
manager and I think one other person who
also had a good look at the guy because
you know my manager actually followed
him out of the bank once he realized
what had happened he got a good look at
him my manager described them the same
way I
did that's right two people in
independently described him as a
completely different person and we both
had a good
look and but when they told me uh I was
wrong and I come back to the bank I turn
around and I look on the wall behind me
where they had the most Wanted pictures
of known bank robbers and and one of
them was the picture of the guy who
robbed me and I'd looked at that picture
a million times and never made the
connection it was that
guy so I guess he liked Robin Robin
banks anyway so I don't know what's
going on but one possibility is that the
real shooter uh killed the Firearms guy
and took his car and maybe his
guns and that possibly the real Shooters
not this Firearms guy but that Firearms
guy might be
dead so that's just a possibility G
given that we don't really know what's
going on it's fog of War anything's
possible I wouldn't I wouldn't make a
big bad on that that uh
hypothesis but he just doesn't look like
the picture to me or the video all right
so for about 10 minutes that story took
uh Israel off the headlines and I said
to myself huh how long is Israel not
going to be the main story and by
mour you know they were already equals
and by this afternoon we'll only be
talking about Israel I
assume well Trump went in for another
gag order I get confused about all of
his legal jeopardies but I guess there's
a second gag order the first ones was
stayed or it's been suspended
temporarily but he got find $10,000 for
saying something about an officer of the
court but B maybe he was talking about
somebody else that's a little unclear he
got mad and he stormed out and blah blah
blah now did I see a story that the ACLU
is backing Trump
to get the gag order taken
away I I feel like I saw a headline on
that but I didn't see the story
itself yeah I'm getting yeses so that
would be an example of the ACLU finally
doing something I agreed with I
appreciate that uh but I don't think
there's any question anymore that the
Biden Administration is a
weaponized weaponized government and
that the um the process is riged you
know the the 2020 24 election is already
rigged they're doing it right in front
of you because the this lawfare stuff
seems so
obviously designed to stop him
politically and not based on a political
or not based on a uh let's say a Justice
philosophy so Justice is not driving
their actions it's just politics so that
is rigging the election you don't have
to wonder if it if it's being rigged
they're doing it right in front of you
so if anybody ever ask again oh Scott do
you think somebody rigged the election
I'm going to say well I don't know let
me examine your question do you believe
that rigging the election applies
narrowly to only the the counting of the
votes or are you that dumb if you think
of it as anything the government does to
fix the outcome well this weaponization
of the government uh Department of
Justice is just rigging election
but they're doing it right in front of
you and it's completely legal but
there's no doubt about it they're
rigging the election right in front of
you or trying we'll see if they
succeed all right uh the US economy um
Against All Odds grew what they call a
staggering 4.9% in the third quarter I'm
trying to remember in my entire life
maybe it happened when I was little have
what was the last time we had a
4.9% growth in the economy when we
weren't coming off a recession or
something never do you believe it's not
true oh maybe it's just because
inflation's up oh that's why it's just
inflation's up all right okay got it
everybody raised their
prices yeah it's okay but what
is true apparently is that we did not go
into a recession would you agree with
that does it look like recession didn't
happen yeah so I'm going to take credit
for uh another prediction that was
counter to The Experts will will you
give me that one if you've been watching
for a while I I was one of the few
people who said I don't think there is
going to be a
recession and almost all the experts
said oh yeah definite definite recession
so U I'm going to take that one as a
victory because
I got that one all right as Jesse Waters
and other people are reporting Jesse
does a great job on these complicated
stories I always recommend Jesse waters
for the cleanest
clearest um summaries of the most
complicated stuff he's great at that um
so Chuck Grassley has some information
that 40 FBI informants had been spying
on the Biden so-called crime family for
15
years 40 different informants apparently
many of them had information that would
have been actionable this these are the
claims
um but uh in each case they were blocked
or nothing happened and that that
blocking continues
today
um and that
uh and that the FBI B basically
was trying to trying to get Trump when
they made up the dossier stuff and
trying to protect Biden for 15 years
which would suggest that the FBI is sort
of Rogue if not just controlled by
democrats now what's fascinating is I
mentioned the other day the uh Oliver
Stone updated
JFK updated uh documentary that's out
now and it's fascinating and in that uh
he alleges that JFK believed that the
FBI was running like its own you know
not his employees it was like running
his own empire under Hoover which I
think
hisor hearing something outside that it
shouldn't be outside um so historically
oh it's a garbage
truck um and apparently
uh multiple field offices uh blocked
every effort to go after the bidens and
the allegation is that the FBI has known
for 15 years that the binds were
crooked um but they might have been
using it to Blackmail the
bidens so it's possible that and that's
just an allegation it's possible that
the FBI or whoever is run or whoever is
controlling the FBI no matter who the
boss is is using the FBI to Blackmail
leaders and that we don't even have
anything like a nothing like a republic
or anything like that it's basically
just sort of a black male Rico criminal
situation and has been for decades you
know maybe since
Kennedy now the reason that I can say
such a thing in public without any risk
because if it were true you'd expect the
people you know in charge to have to
kill me or something and the reason I
can say it is nobody believes it it is
such a big it's such a big claim that
your head can't even hold it it's like
wait what did you say the government of
the United States has been a basically a
criminal Enterprise you know using the
FBI and probably the CIA as enforcers or
maybe they were even their own domains
doing their own thing who knows but it's
something like that yes that's what I'm
saying and that there's ample evidence
in fact more than ample it is beyond
ample it's to the point of obvious and
your brains still can't handle it well
but they're still collecting taxes and
building roads you're like yeah yeah I
mean it's kind of working I didn't say
it didn't work I'm just saying it's
nothing like you thought it was you know
we don't we don't have any
representative government or anything
like that is pretty much just a criminal
Enterprise all right
um let's
see so uh the big the big worry here is
if these claims these allegations are
true it would suggest that there isn't
any way that Trump could win the next
election because he would be seen as an
existential threat to the entire
criminal web of organization ations from
the FBI to God knows
what so that would suggest that there's
a JFK situation building up here not
necessarily an assassination but it
could be the law fair it could be
something to just take Trump out Trump
has let me just say one thing about
Trump you I'm still backing ramaswami I
think we need to go younger
but he is
Brave he he's legitimately Brave I
wasn't sure that that was you know just
part of his act but the more you see of
him the more it it looks true he looks
like he's risking his life to see if he
can clean things up and he knows it he
would have to know he's risking his
life uh you know after after he killed
uh uh
sulamani the Iranian terrorist guy and I
assume that would just open up the the
ability for Iran to assassinate him
back but they wisely chose not to I
don't think they could have taken that
hit but uh the the balls on that guy
like he just kills this guy he just
orders him killed and then goes on with
his
day I'm trying to like wrap my head
around how difficult it would be to be
in his situation where he's being
threatened with jail every day he's got
like tons of people who want to take him
out for every reason you could imagine
he has every reason to retire and not
put up with any of this stuff and he
just can't do it he he's he's drawn to
the
fight
so well all right uh Israel uh had what
they call their biggest raid
yet on Gaza but nobody nobody on the
Israeli side was injured so it was
mostly just tanks nobody got into of the
tanks they drove around for a while and
did whatever they needed to do or
accomplished whatever they needed to do
and came
back um I would assume that in this kind
of operation there are a whole bunch of
probes before there would be some kind
of a larger attack so I would put this
in the probe category not the raid
category
um now the uh
the
talk is is about the question of whether
they should go in quickly or go in
slowly I would like to as I have before
question the military experts who say
that the longer you wait the harder it's
going to be because they'll have time to
prepare um I'm not sure that's true
because both sides have time to prepare
but if both sides prepared equally
wouldn't Israel have an
advantage because I think you know
having everybody trapped in a Kill Zone
and preparing is very much better than
being in the Kill Zone and being
prepared to kill preparing to be killed
you know while trying to take as many
people as you can so it seems to me that
time is more on Israel's side militarily
strategically tactically than maybe the
experts are saying however public
opinion in Israel and elsewhere among
supporters definitely wants it to happen
fast now if you're in Israel you want it
to happen fast because your your blood
is boiling and you you'd feel the same
way you just you just want blood you you
need to get rid of the risk you don't
want ever even once to think that your
children would be subject to that kind
of risk ever again so you'd want to
smash it you'd want to do it fast you'd
want to do a complete and he wouldn't
care about much else that would be a
normal uh a normal opinion and you can
see why they have it now allegedly and I
think this is questionable but allegedly
the United States has asked Israel to
hold back a little while until we can
get some U missile defense and maybe
some missiles and other assets into the
area and they say the intention of that
is to keep the other players mostly Iran
and Hezbollah from and maybe Syria and
who knows who else from uh getting
active and joining the fight it would be
a way to suppress them maybe yeah turkey
Etc now maybe but you shouldn't believe
anything in the context of War so I
don't know about that it seems to me
just as likely that Israel wanted to
delay because they weren't quite ready
now here's here's the dance that Israel
has to make if they go to too soon and
they just you know brutalize the entire
area the civilian deaths will probably
be too high or at the very least their
enemies can um frame it as too high
whatever too high is one is too high I
suppose
and so if they go in soon they've got to
worry about creating something that will
look like genocide because their enemies
will call it genocide no matter what it
is no matter how um respectfully they
treat the locals who are not combatants
no
matter how much um casualties they take
themselves to avoid civilian casualties
it's not going to matter to their
enemies they're still going to call it a
genocide so at the very least they want
to have the facts on their side right to
not create something that a reasonable
person would call a
genocide if they wait too long then they
might you know lose some morale and you
know maybe the other the other team's
leaders could escape and you know there
could be other bad things from awaiting
while they get ready which is a good
thing but my take is that the ideal way
to go in is
slow but
right so I think slower is actually to
their advantage and while nobody in
Israel wants to go slow not the military
not the public I think it's good for
them
because let me be let me be direct all
right I'm I'm 100% backing
Israel and you know I'm not doing any
moral equivalent all right that
there was a horrible attack they need to
go take care of it it is their business
for the most part I mean we'll get
Dragged In but they're going to do what
they're going to do that said let me say
directly nobody in Israel is thinking
straight
I'm just going to say it directly nobody
in Israel is capable of making a
clear-headed decision do you know why
because they're normal they're
normal thinking people who in the world
could make an objective smart you know
long-term decision in this context oh
the really smart leaders can no they
can't oh the people who are
professionals and know how to do this
stuff you know they won't be so
emotional yes they
will yes they will it's their children
too absolutely they'll be
so don't even pretend that Israel
because of the trauma that they've just
suffered could make anything like good
long-term decisions I just don't think
they're capable you know as capable as
they are in general nobody can be in
this situation nobody nobody no matter
how smart you are no matter how
well-meaning you are no matter your
intentions you can't put anybody in that
situation and expect them to act like a
normal person it's just not a thing now
I've had a number of conversations with
people who were there and uh who live
there and I can tell you that their
thinking uh does not include the risk of
World War
I at least I haven't determined it now
definitely they think about it it's one
it's in the conversation right but in
terms of the odds of it I think they're
discounting it to
zero they do I do think that they expect
you know a high chance that Iran and
Hezbollah and and therefore Lebanon will
be part of the the battle there's a good
chance that's going to
happen but um I think that the thinking
is that it's a a localized thing now
from an American
perspective the thing that I would worry
about you know protecting the families
in the Homeland here is that Iran would
be uh so threatened by military action
and let's say that the hot hot war
begins that they would um maybe activate
whatever cells they have in
America and that you saw that uh one
person with some
Firearms um may have injured I don't
know 50 to 80 people may have killed 16
and he's not done he's still on the
loose that's one person you saw what I
don't know 1500 fighters from Hamas
could do they took a country to its
knees 1500
people so how many people would it take
in America to take down major
infrastructure the answer is alarmingly
few alarmingly few it's really just the
case of whether Iran says go do it if
they have agents here and they're
trained and Iran says go do it
it's going to get pretty ugly here in
the United
States now if I were making the decision
as a robot how would I do it all right
here's how a robot would do it but
nobody's a robot so this is just as
contrast if our a robot I would say all
right odds of um odds of winning the war
against Hamas if we go in hard against
uh
Gaza probably close to 100% would you
agree the the amount of casualties in
the civilian group is a huge variable
and the most important part in my
opinion in the short term uh but they
could definitely get the job done and I
would also say that other words killing
the the armed Hamas people and their
leaders um and that that has to be done
now I'd also like to say that every
scenario has the Hamas leadership just
wiped out and and their soldiers so
there's I don't think anybody's in favor
of anything that doesn't get that done
whether it's slowly or quickly that's
going to get done that that decision is
made and done and there's nothing left
to talk
about
but if our robot I say to myself all
right 100% Hamas is destroyed and then
i' put some percentage of likelihood
that the civilian casualties are
horrific and then I put some percentage
that they were you know kept down to a
lower level if they go in slowly I'm
going to guess fewer civilian casualties
because they'll have time to maybe
filter some good people out you know the
civilians um maybe but then I would say
all right now calculate the risk of a
more Global or let's say Regional War i'
say all right odds of a regional War
if Israel goes in
hard uh
50% 50% because the US military is
sitting there ready to attack both
Lebanon and Iran I assume uh or at least
back up Israel in those attacks and I
think hbel has like 200,000
missiles aimed at Israel
200,000 in order to take out 200,000
missiles you're you're talking of really
major action I would assume that
wouldn't be fast either and those
missiles are going to be firing in the
meantime so it's going to get pretty
ugly so I'd say all right the odds of
that would you say 50% well give me your
odds tell me let's say Israel goes in
hard and whether it's true or not the
enemy say oh you've killed too many
civilians of course one would be too
many what do you think of the odds of Le
of Lebanon and
Hezbollah attacking Israel with
something closer to full force what do
you think I'm I'll just read out your
numbers 30 100% yes 100% 100% is the
wrong number 75 990 25 50 all right so
I'm a robot so I would talk to a bunch
of people and I would pull them because
actually if you took the average of
people's opinions it probably wouldn't
be too terrible in terms of an estimate
of it happening cuz humans are humans so
if you tell all the humans what's the
situation you know a whole bunch of
humans if you take their average
probably pretty close to what will
happen you that that's my hypothesis
anyway so if I'm a robot I say all right
talk to all the people they say anywhere
from you know 90 to 30% so I'll pick a
midpoint
50% a lower to little 40% 40% chance
that it turns into major arayan
Hezbollah action us is in you know
Russia wonders what to do that sort of
thing so would you take a 40% chance of
that but remember that's not all bad
because it could be that that's the 40%
you want to happen if you're Israel
because you might say at this point you
know what we always knew we'd have to
fight we always knew it this is the best
time to do it because we have at least
the cover of this horrific uh terrorist
Act
to give us cover to do the things that
we knew we had to do we knew we've known
forever that it's going to be military
and the Hezbollah is not going to aim
200,000 rockets at us and we're just
going to let it grow right war is coming
no matter what there's no better time to
do it but then I'd
say so so so far everything's positive
for Israel right it's positive if they
get rid of M and it's positive if it
Sparks a larger War which they can now
use um take the opportunity to eliminate
those risks or reduce them as much as
possible so they might actually be
thinking you know what can't think of a
better outcome than having the entire
you know having the US Navy right off
the beach at the same time we need to do
something with Hezbollah and maybe the
leadership of
Iran so but then the next question is
could that lead to Russia getting
involved uh or a nuclear exchange
somewhere if if hezbollah's missiles are
better than we think and Iran also
launches and maybe somebody else joins
in at the same
time could it destroy
Israel I mean could Israel be one month
away from not
existing that's not impossible is
it and then if if it look L like it was
going to be that bad would Israel use a
nuke because if they did they would be
the you know Pariah Forever on the other
hand it might be the only thing to save
their
country what would they do if they
thought it was the only thing they could
do I don't know honestly I don't have a
guess I don't know if they take the hit
as brutal as it would be or would they
say you know what we're we're just going
to end this right now
I have no idea but it's not zero would
you agree the the odds of this sparking
something nuclear either something with
Russia or Israel just you know ends up
not doing as well as they hoped and it's
just the only thing they have left
what's the odds of that what are the
odds of it going nuclear Andor more than
Regional and becoming Global because
nuclear might get that
done your estimates are Z 0 50 25% 15 I
think the odds of nuclear are going to
be
below well below
20% but above 1% would be my
guess let's put it at
10% all right if there's a 10%
chance that what Israel is doing would
create a nuclear confrontation somewhere
Andor a World War
what would the robot say about doing it
meaning going in uh into
Gaza well the robot might say you know
what would be better just take your uh
losses of a thousand people every 10
years from from terrorism because it's
never going to
stop and you know try to contain it
because the alternative is uh if you do
an expected value calculation you would
multiply the number of people who could
die in a nuclear attack times the odds
that would happen so if you thought
there was a 10% chance that 10 million
people would die you would value that as
a million
people why are you swearing at
me what's your
problem I don't even know what that's
about somebody yeah somebody straighten
him
out
so that's so if you if you're a robot
you'd say do whatever you can to avoid a
10% chance of a nuclear confrontation
but if you were a country whose children
had just been uh killed in front of
their parents
it honestly that's what you would say if
you were in their position that's what
you would say yeah this might lead to a
World War but it's a small chance and
there's no way they're getting away with
this
no way so there is a
slight a slight difference of interests
here maybe not a big one but there's a
slight one which is that what is best
for Israel in terms of not only their
mental health but their future Security
is to go hard and completely eliminate
the enemy maybe as soon as possible even
at the risk of Civilian deaths that are
shocking
so that would make sense if you were
there and you had gone through that if
you were a
robot maybe you'd have a different
opinion but the robots are not in charge
so it's
irrelevant uh there's no need to go in
just keep the water off you know I don't
know enough about sieges to know why
that won't
work if you just kep you there may be an
aquifer or something they can get to I
would I would think food would be the
bigger one but what would happen if he
just
waited
so for reasons that are are very human
people are going to be way more worried
about the 200 and whatever hostages than
they are about the 200 people who
probably died today in bombing would you
agree that for some reason hostages grab
our grab our brains in the way that a
thousand people are dying a day that we
don't see their names and they're just
in the rubble like somehow it doesn't
put your brain on fire the same way it
should it should but it
doesn't
um so here's what I think I think those
hostages have no chance of living if
Israel goes in fast maybe you know a
small chance but a very bad chance if if
Hamas thinks that they have any chance
at all of stalling for ADV Vantage or
negotiating something away they could
easily give us back some
hostages and in my opinion that would be
worth the wait one of the offers I saw
that was
hilarious was that we would trade all of
those hostages that Hamas has for every
one of Israel's hostages which are far
more the trick would be they have the
hostages released would be released uh
in
Gaza and then they would just kill them
in
Gaza now what's interesting is they
might say yes to that if you are hamash
you might say wait you're going to
release them but they're going to come
here in The Siege well we're here in The
Siege yeah bring them they they'll help
us fight they might actually say yes to
that which would be
weird so who knows so my guess is that
uh uh Israel will continue to say we
want to go now but America is holding us
back but maybe everybody wants to hold
back and maybe that's a convenient story
so you have a reason for holding back so
your your uh citizens don't get angry at
you or lose
hope all right uh president XI of China
apparently you you might be aware there
was a huge collapse in the real estate
market a lot of things got built and
financed that nobody wanted to live in
they were
unnecessary uh but now she is looking to
blame the bankers so he's going after
the executives of the banks which is bad
if you're a Chinese executive
and the government decides to go after
you that doesn't work out well for you
so China's got
trouble both in banking and real
estate and it makes me
wonder um I do wonder about shei and
Corruption it seems to me that the big
thing that America does better than a
lot of other countries is we police our
corruption a little bit better we still
have too much but you can you can
generally count on doing a deal with an
American Business and something like
exactly what you agreed to will happen
most of the time right I'm not sure
that's true in China you know may maybe
in China it's just all bribery
everywhere and I don't know how bad it
is but it's interesting to see she going
after corruption at the highest levels
in banking in real estate so it does
make you
wonder um I mean part ofby thinks that
he that he just wants to turn the
corruption to his benefit and he's only
mad because he wasn't getting any it
wasn't helping him so it's not really
about making the country better it's
like well I wasn't getting a share so
this doesn't work I we'll keep an eye on
it so
peteran um had the most uh absurdly
non-believable
story that goes like this that the
Chinese spy balloons was not at all what
you thought it was and that it wasn't
president XI even being aware of it how
does he know that I don't know um but
that
the well well The Story Goes Like
This the reason we didn't shoot them
down is that we put our own assets
flying assets above them and Below them
and sucked all of their um digital
secrets and of the balloon so the
balloon got nothing because our missile
silos were closed and you know we of
course protect against this stuff all
right I'm not saying any of this is
true just tell you what he said yeah we
we'll get to the part where I don't
believe any of it all right so we'll get
to the that
part and so the story was that we're so
good at hacking things we hacked their
balloon we figured out what uh City the
signals were coming from and wait it
gets better according to Peter uh we
figured out what floor it was coming
from and we figured out the computer it
was coming from and that allowed them to
piece together the entire network of who
was involved with the Spy balloon and
somehow they determined sure that uh
that China's uh intelligence Services
had done this as a a rogue thing that
even she didn't know
about do you believe
that does any of that sound
true now uh Peter Zan is often Accused
by people of having some kind of CIA
connection I don't know anything about
that I just know it's funny because he
says things that are so perfect
perfectly aligned with what you would
expect the CIA would want you to hear
it's like could it be a coincidence
could be a coincidence I mean it might
be could be just total coincidence but
when I see somebody say that President
shei doesn't know what his intelligence
agencies are doing and the intelligence
agencies have embarrassed him greatly on
the world
stage that looks like exactly what the
CIA would want uh China to hear so that
they would have internal fighting and
not trust each
other now how would Peter Zan know all
this
stuff literally none of it none of it
sounds a credible at
all so there's that um Peter zayan also
said that the American cyber skills are
just way way better than the other
countri is not even close and that our
people have already penetrated all the
major systems of our
of our foes and uh if they attacked us
uh our cyber guys would just turn off
their entire um operation and it would
take years to
recover
sure do you know what else I used to
think was
true I used to think that Russia were so
good at hacking that they'd be hacking
all of Ukraine systems and Ukraine would
be helpless cuz all that hacking would
take him
down have you heard any stories of
having problems with
hacking I feel like maybe hackers are
overrated now it could be that only
American hackers are good
maybe but remember when uh we're talking
about Russia hacked the DNC emails and
that we knew exactly who it
was I never believed any of
that none of that sounded true no I
don't believe that that they could
figure out who who did it what kind of
hacker would be you know getting into
this sort of thing like an official
government hacker and couldn't couldn't
cover their
Trails what kind of hacking is
that yeah that sounds like maybe maybe
America did it never know you never know
what's true these days so I don't
believe that our cyber people are
already in all of the systems of our
foes and can turn off their
lights I don't know that doesn't sound
true that sounds like something the CIA
would want other countries to think
doesn't it doesn't that sound
exactly exactly what you'd want the
other countries to think especially if
you're looking to you know go to war hey
Iran I don't know I just thought I'd
mentioned our hackers are so good we
could turn off your whole country
anytime we want just thought you should
know it's a good time to tell you well I
don't think any of that's true frankly
um the CEO of
x uh what's her name Linda
yino actually said in public that they
expect X to turn a profit by early
2024
what
really that would that would be the most
impressive thing I've ever seen in
business like I'm skeptical so so I'm
going to you I'm going to be skeptical
about it
but wow imagine if it really happened I
would be so
impressed because it it looked like
there was no hope that Twitter would
ever be profitable it didn't look like
there was anything you could do then
so how in the world did he do
thatan was just
subscriptions I I don't know I guess I'm
skeptical that they could really be
profitable in 2024
but you know even if it's 2025 it would
be kind of
amazing all
right we'll see we'll keep our eye out
for that all right ladies and
gentlemen that
concludes the best live stream you'll
see this
morning I'm going to say goodbye to the
uh folks here on
YouTube i b didn't struggle session
what's up I'm looking at some of your
comments right
now cash flow positive well that's a
good question are they profitable or are
they cash flow positive that's a good
question all right um bye for now and
I'll talk to you tomorrow
