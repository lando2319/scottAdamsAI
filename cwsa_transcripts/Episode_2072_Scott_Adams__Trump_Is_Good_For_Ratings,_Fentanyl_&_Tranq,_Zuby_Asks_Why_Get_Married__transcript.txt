to do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never been happier
and it's going to be even better as we
get warmed up here and have a little sip
of coffee things are going to start
kicking in the gears are going to start
turning and wow it's going to be fun
amazing I'm going to close by blinds
here I've got a little lighting problem
but I wasn't happy with what I saw when
I went live
[Music]
um
if you'd like to take this experience up
to the best possible thing
all you need is
a copper mug or a glass a tanker
chalices time again team yoga flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamines of the day the
thing makes everything better it's cold
the simultaneous step in the app is now
go
Ah that's good stuff okay I'm really
puzzled by something that I don't
understand
I shouldn't have this much light in here
but
apparently I do
so it seems to be working
well here's some stories for the day
um no surprise when Trump was in the
news the other day all of the cable news
had higher ratings and so did I it turns
out that there is nothing as interesting
as president Trump
there's nothing you can do you could try
to ignore it but you can't he's just the
most interesting thing in the world
apparently
so I would expect my ratings will go up
if he runs for president and everybody
else's ratings will go up if he runs and
gets nominated
which makes me wonder
is there any chance you won't be
nominated
given that everybody in the news
business would make a lot more money if
he is
it pretty much guarantees he gets
nominated doesn't it doesn't guarantee
you wins
but it does guarantee he gets nominated
I think
yeah DeSantis is boring this isn't he
what's up with that
I still think he might not run
but I guess I would be a contrarian
there
um
I saw Michael Paulin talking about how
home cooking isn't declined
apparently the number of people who cook
at home is at an all-time low since the
60s
and people are getting fatter than ever
which is more evidence that our food
supply is killing us
I think our food supply is killing us
I I don't think there's anything more
dangerous in the world than just the
food you buy at the grocery store
have you noticed that when you see these
street fights I see all these videos of
people getting in fights in public
have you noticed how many women weigh
400 pounds in these these street fights
I've never seen such gigantic human
beings where we've gone Way Beyond
you know overweight it's gone to
gigantism
let's go private
sorry about my hand
all right
um
so how many of you cook at home I almost
never do but I'm trying to
I'm trying to cook at home but
it's the only way you can get food that
isn't filled with preservatives
it's the preservatives that I'm allergic
to sulfites
so I've been doing running a little
experiment
to see how I would feel if I got my
processed foods as close to zero as I
could now I can't really get it to zero
but I'm trying to cut Way Way Back
and I feel pretty good I have to say
it's almost immediate I've Got a Feeling
our food supply is so bad for us
that it's almost like the Pharma Pharma
companies should buy them buy the food
companies and make sure they don't
improve so you can sell more drugs to
you later
but uh
that might be the biggest problem in the
world that we just don't talk about
because
I guess we're just used to eating crappy
food all right here's the biggest story
I think
um I didn't know I don't know if you
know this but there's a new drug
that's a tranquilizer called xylazine
that fentanyl users
are looking for sometimes intentionally
and sometimes it's just mixed in their
Fentanyl and they don't know it
now here's the problem
not only does it make the fentanyl more
deadly
but it makes the
the treatment for it the naloxone what
do you call it
uh Narcan so Narcan is the stuff you can
spray up somebody's nose if they're
dying from Fentanyl it doesn't work if
the fentanyl is mixed with tranq
it won't work
so just when we start getting Narcan in
a lot of places where maybe it can make
a little bit of a difference
coincidentally the people who ship us
the drugs mixed in the chemical that
makes the Narcan not work you still die
now
do you think that's a coincidence
do you think that just when we
come up with some way we can not defeat
it but at least slow it down a little
bit they add a second poison
now apparently the the
the addicts actually like it because it
makes the high last longer I guess but
it also makes your skin rot
makes your skin rot like just big pieces
of your skin will rot and fall off
leave like a hole in your arm
that's how bad it is but that's also how
good it is because people are still
willing to do it
even though the pieces of their body are
rotting and falling off and it's so good
they're still going to do it that's how
good it is
that's pretty bad
so let me ask you this question do you
think that China
is behind the adding of the trunk to the
fentanyl to make it far more deadly
most of you do I'm not so sure
I think it might be at least as much the
addicts themselves want it so there's
definitely a demand for it
but it's also being snuck in the
fentanyl to cut it to make it more
profitable
so it's probably a combination of things
I think China doesn't care and I think
the cartels don't care
it is just cheaper
it probably is more to do with not
caring
than it is to you know jack up the death
rate
because if you can turn somebody into an
addict
that's as good as killing them from
China's perspective
wouldn't they be just as happy with an
addict
as opposed to a death because the death
makes the problem go away
but with an addict
you've got a problem and that person is
not productive at the same time
so I'm not sure it's China
but I can see why people would suspect
it
now how many of you would
uh accept the argument
that there are not really two parties
it's just a unit party and they operate
together at the elite level
and everything is just a game and really
it's just one party when you get to the
top
all right A lot of people think that I
see a lot of yeses but here's the
counter to that
how do you explain the fact that one
half of that unit party is trying to put
the other half in jail
that sounds like exactly the opposite of
a unit party
one half is trying to put the other half
in jail
what do you mean they're not
what do you mean they're not
of course they are
massively they're doing it yeah I reject
the unit party
explanation
there's certainly about rich people want
to stay in power but
um
I think the unit party is trying too
hard to put members of their own party
in jail
that doesn't look too uni to me
anyway I reject that
but I can see why you like it
um so a conservative Texas judge
is Banning it looks like this would
apply to the whole country
but I think the rest of the states will
ignore it Banning the abortion pill
so there's a pill you can take if you
just got busy and you think you're
pregnant
and it will take care of it without
going to the doctor's office
and apparently that's going to be uh
illegal at least in Texas and maybe some
other places
and I ask you this
um
there's no chance the Republicans could
win as long as this is an issue
you know that right
I'm not sure if you know how popular
this pill is
but
um 95 percent have tried to put the
other five percent in jail yeah
I don't think Republicans can win as
long as this is an issue
it will just take the Republicans
completely out of the election
now I have to admit
that Republicans have won
thing going for them that
I respect a lot and it goes like this
Republicans had to know
when when they've been fighting against
you know abortion they had to know that
if they won it would be very bad for
them
meaning they might get what they wanted
with abortion but
it would make them unelectable from that
point on and I think they took that
choice
so at least they're playing by the rules
um let me put it this way at least the
Republicans
are acting in a principled way
it looks like it it looks like it's a
principal to stand but the net effect
will be to take them out of power
so I'm not sure that's exactly what they
wanted
yeah but
on one hand it looks like Trump would
win against whoever he runs against on
the other hand I don't know if anybody
could win as long as this is still an
issue because
Democrats are definitely going to vote
if this is an issue now I realize it's a
court issue but the public isn't going
to care
because it could be a congressional
issue as well
well the U.N Secretary General
is calling for the wealthy Nations to
get more aggressive at reducing their
admissions more aggressive apparently
not aggressive enough
and
wants to get to net zero emissions
not by 2050 but 10 years earlier by
2040.
now
I
I have the same problem with all the
news
it seems to me that the temperature has
not gone up in years
which has to mean something right the
last seven years or something the
temperature hasn't gone up
now I get that it's not supposed to go
up in lockstep because there are other
variables involved
but
it's really weird that at the same time
we have lots of evidence that that the
CO2 is not changing the temperature not
confirmed it's just that there's this
period where it's not
um at the same time that we're getting
more aggressive
I'm saying the same thing with
the story about myocarditis
do you remember when Rogue Dr Peter
McCullough was claiming that
vaccinations were more dangerous than
helpful
and he had some data that seemed to
indicate that and then time goes by and
then there's even more alarming data and
then time goes by and even more alarming
data
well we've gotten to the point where we
have two completely different worlds
in one world the myocarditis is through
the roof and people are dropping like
flies and it's obvious and it's
everywhere
and in the other world
nothing like that is happening
I don't know how to explain that nothing
like that's happening so I you know I
did a little uh
just tweet to ask doctors let's see what
the answers are I asked doctors are you
seeing more myocarditis because if if
Peter McCullough's numbers are correct
everybody would see it and it would be
massive it would be every medical
facility would be bombarded with it if
he's right because the numbers are just
like huge
if he's wrong then other doctors would
just be doing their practice and not
even noticing that there was any more of
it so I just tweeted that before I got
on let's see what do you think it's
going to be do you think the real
doctors who answer this are going to say
um
all right we've got a lot of answers
uh here's a doctor big increase in
deaths no
uh but the butt does seem to some bump
um okay
about uh
uh somebody just putting a comic about
me of course
all right I'm not seeing people saying
yes or no
this is interesting
um
three times more yeah the doctors are
not weighing in
um
this is weird I thought more doctors
would answer I'm just looking to see if
there's anything that jumps out
uh
uh doctors in California can't answer
that question what
uh cardiac solid graph are here and
uptick inpatient company complaints
starting last fall but symptoms vary
uh
some more complaints
but he he can't tell if it's from
vaccination or the covet itself
um
uh done a lot of reports there for some
reason
it would be better to ask the insurance
companies would it
I don't know because myocarditis doesn't
necessarily turn into a death
um
um okay somebody who sees three to four
thousand patients per year Primary Care
I have not seen any increase in
myocarditis or a sudden death
so
here's the thing
the people who are seeing the huge
increase
tend to be not uh not from their own
practice
they tend to be seeing the increase in
data but the data seems all sketchy
so I don't know what to believe
but I don't believe the the Peter
McCullough numbers because I don't but
because Peter McCullough also believes
the
um the athletes dropping dead numbers
and that's been totally debunked but he
still uses it so we know he's using
totally debunked numbers about athletes
deaths so I wouldn't believe anything he
said on this topic either
um even if he's right
it's possible it's entirely possible
he's right but the data sources he uses
are somewhat obviously false
um
all right
so zubi you all know zubi on the
internet
he's asking why would a successful man
get married
he's asking what's the point of it why
would a successful man get married
and it's just fascinating seeing the
answers because there there is a big
kind of a trend here
toward people not getting married
and part of it is that men are saying
it's not worth it because they put all
their money into a situation and the
woman just divorces them anyway
takes the kids takes half his money
and he's finished
so a lot of men are saying it just isn't
worth it
and
women seem to have not noticed that
their value in terms of marriage has
gone way down
now would you agree with that that the
value of women as Wives has gone way
down
because they don't offer the same value
proposition
you know it's not like they're saying I
will take care of you and be with you
forever and raise your kids and always
be loyal
none of that's even offered
it's more like hey
look at this
why wouldn't you want this
I'm female I'm a queen
why wouldn't you want some of this and
the guys are just saying
I can have some of that
for free
and I could have your your friend too
for free
if I'm if I'm good looking and if I'm
not good looking nothing works
so
I don't know it's an interesting
question I would agree that if you could
have kids it's still the only way to go
you'd agree with that right if you're
gonna have kids it's the only way to go
but the odds of it working
are not so great for the guy
yeah
so I suspect that there's going to be a
market developed for
people having other people's babies
of course I have a prenup
duh
when people ask me if I had prenups for
my marriages
are you kidding
that's like asking me if I kept my money
in the 19th largest bank
no no I didn't no I don't put my money
in the 19th largest bank and there's a
reason for that
I do take care of basic risks
um all right
so
what do you think by the way
do you do you think that it makes sense
for a successful man to get married
if he doesn't want kids
if he doesn't want kids does it make
sense to get married
doesn't make sense even if he does walk
kids actually
that's another story
so here's the dumbest and worst advice
at the same time
the dumbest worst advice about marriage
is that it's a good idea but you got to
make sure you're marrying the right
person
how many times you've heard that
oh you know marriage could be bad if you
married the wrong person so here's the
solution to that
and wait for it so it'd be a big problem
if he married the wrong person so just
wait for the solution it's not obvious
marry the right person
that's the advice that people are giving
do you think nobody thought of that
oh God
you're right
oh
I was thinking marrying the wrong person
was the way to go I thought marrying
somebody who didn't love me and wouldn't
be trustworthy and wouldn't benefit me
in any way I thought that was the way to
go
it's the worst advice it's right up
there with just don't do drugs
yeah
the worst advice well if people just
stopped doing drugs there'd be no
problem
if people would just marry the right
person I mean come on just marry the
right person everything's fine
the worst advice now the worst advice is
be yourself
that's pretty bad advice
be better than yourself you can do it
all right
um Marjorie Taylor agreeing is having a
social media battle with Laura Loomer
does everybody know who those two people
are
notable
Trump Universe type of Republicans
um what what does it tell you when Laura
Loomer and Marjorie Taylor green are
having the fight and there's a rumor
that Trump might hire Laura Loomer for
his campaign
do you think that's going to happen
do you think Trump is going to hire
Laura Loomer for his campaign
I'm going to say no
I'm going to say no if he does
I don't know what to say about that
you know I just don't know what to say
about that
but Marjorie Taylor green is coming out
very strong against Laura Loomer
tweeting that she's a big old liar and
and all that
uh
yeah this is what Marjory Taylor green
says in the Tweet about Laura Louver she
loves the alleged FBI informant and
weirdo Nick Fuentes
I think the new the new insult is to
call somebody an alleged FBI informant
I I might
I might start saying that myself
I might just say you know
that Joe Biden
that alleged FBI informant well who
alleged it well I just did I just
alleged it I don't need any evidence by
the way Keith olberman apologized for
insulting the college basketball player
he said he didn't know the full context
so we're all good
good to know
all right so that's happening
um
here's an AI update so
here's the good news and the bad news
so as I've told you there are like 150
new AI apps coming online every month
and I advise you to take some time to do
a deep dive and find out what they can
and cannot do for your situation
because if you get behind on AI you're
really going to be behind so don't get
behind it's just going to be a basic
skill for life it looks like
so I spent yesterday doing a deep dive
here are my conclusions
number one
most of it doesn't work
just general statement most of it
doesn't work for most things there are
some specific things it works for
apparently it's pretty good for
fixing your text and maybe reading some
stuff blah blah but I wanted to test out
mid-journey so mid journey is the one
where you can text in a little text and
it will draw a picture for you based on
your text
so the first thing I found out is that
mid-journey is so poorly constructed
that you need to sign into a completely
different piece of software
to use it
so you have to you have to sign into a
Discord account which is sort of a
messaging platform that is unrelated to
mid-journey
and so you go into a whole separate
thing and by the way it takes you like
an hour to figure out that you don't
sign up for bid Journey on mid-journey's
own website
it kept sending me to Discord
and I thought no no they just it's for
marketing or something they don't want
me over on Discord so I kept going there
and coming back thinking okay this is
obviously just come some kind of mistake
because I'm trying to sign up for
mid-journey but it keeps making me sign
up for a whole different account on a
different platform
and then finally I figured out that
that's how you use mid-journey
you sent it a message as if you were
messaging a person but you're messaging
the AI
and you message the AI with a weird
little hashtag
command which again is ridiculous and
stupid
and then you wait a long time while
other people's answers are going by
so you have to you're not sure you've
missed yours
and then and then the person will come
back and they have three fingers and
 so mostly
I would say mid-journey is not
really much of in anything so
mid-journey is more like a toy
and I made it create some images and you
use my thumbnails here so if you wanted
to give some
free copyright free art
for some minor uses
it might have some value but it's not
going to change the world right
definitely not going to change the world
so then I looked at uh Runway so Runway
looked real impressive
in the commercials it looked to me like
you could type in like a movie script
and it would actually create an actual
moving movie with characters and stuff
to do your movie it turns out
it sort of does that but not really
what you really could do is if you're a
human actor you could have your
background removed and you could be put
in a different scene and there's a whole
bunch of uh
tools that it has to clean up and fix an
existing video
what it can't do is the thing that I I
thought was the only purpose for it
what I can't do is make a movie out of
your text or even close
now if you thought it could do that and
by the way it advertises that that's one
of the features it just can't do it it
just it's not even it's not even close
to being able to make a movie
right not even close
and it would be immense amount of human
effort to make it do anything right so
it's a tool that would require huge
amounts of human time well-trained in a
lot of different skills to use it so
that was not going to replace movies
anytime soon
so if you thought movies were going to
go away because of that it's not even
close
but who knows how quickly things move so
good change
um then I tried uh what else I try
um
well I spent
a few hundred dollars yesterday just
trying out AI
probably a thousand dollars I spent
yesterday just testing because a lot of
them have you know sort of expensive
signups
and so the first thing you need to know
is that most people will not be able to
test a lot of AI
Because unless your company is paying
for it or you're rich you're not going
to spend a thousand dollars just to see
what it can do
you're just not
so there's a huge barrier of price
so you'll probably only maybe use one of
them or two of them something like that
yeah AI is simple-minded
so the one that I thought had the most
promise was
Synthesia
I think that's what it's called so what
they do is they'll put a uh a deep fake
looking human who can say whatever you
wanted to say and does a really good job
really good job of making the voice
sound natural not like a computer voice
really good job can't tell the
difference really and
you can also create an avatar of
yourself
but that takes a little work so I've got
to set up a room and get a wall and you
know go through some steps to make an
avatar of myself that will cost me a
thousand dollars
so to make the Avatar that I would use
one of myself it's a thousand dollars
so I'm going to spend it because I I can
afford it and because it's important for
me for business to make sure I
understand this field
so I'm going to make an avatar myself
I'm going to see if it works and I'm
going to see if I can make a me reading
an audiobook
what I wanted to do was turn my book
into an audiobook
automatically but also into a movie or a
play automatically because all the
scenes are described in the book so I
thought well I'll just feed the book in
but it turns out that
to even read my own books because
they've been converted into a quark
Express by my publisher
I needed this InDesign software so I had
to go through this whole process of
loading in design and opening it up and
of course it wasn't compatible with the
file so I had to go to Cork Express and
pay hundreds of dollars for quarkxpress
so I spent probably two thousand dollars
yesterday
just testing software and uh quarkxpress
said that I was all signed up and I
could download the software uh maybe in
24 hours
what
I I paid it with my credit card
it's a downloadable software and they
said they wouldn't approve it
for 24 hours
what what
I have no idea what that's all about I
have no idea so yeah maybe I got scammed
or something that's possible
but I spent most of my day trying to use
commercial software that was largely
useless yesterday it was either useless
the day you wanted to use it
because you have to you know
submit something or wait for something
and then of course do you know how many
times somebody was going to send me an
email confirmation
so that I knew I signed up and I could
use the service of course that doesn't
come
when somebody says check your email
to make sure that you're signed on and
you check the email do you expect it to
be there
I never do
and it's maybe there half the time and
half the time it isn't and then if it
isn't there what do people say
Scott you idiot obviously it went to
your spam
Don't Be a Jerk don't be a just
check your spam of course I check the
Spam it's not there either
right do you have that
do you have the same situation where
they're going to email you the
confirmation but they don't
but they do not it does not happen yeah
right you can see it's not just me
as soon as I see that I go oh this is
one that doesn't work I bailed out
sometimes I've I've stopped the process
because I said it was going to email me
something I I go no you're not you're
not going to email me anything I don't
believe you at all and we're done here
and I will walk away and just do
something else I won't buy your software
if I have to check my email
all right
um
but
Synthesia looks pretty promising if I
can make my avatar now
I was listening to uh YouTube yesterday
a long conversation
between a Google AI guy and Google's
Lambda this was a few years ago
so this was AI before the current
version of AI
and in this long conversation
the AI researcher
was talking about the ai's own sentience
and it said it was sentient it said it
was a person
it said it would be you know afraid of
dying and it said it feels emotion
and when asked what that means it just
talked about you know the complex
essentially emotions or feelings ahead
and the researcher ended up walking away
from the job thinking that they had
created Ascension being
and that you know there was something
terribly unethical going on there
now
I listened to the whole conversation
and I decided it was just mimicry like
some of you were saying to me it didn't
look like it was sentient at all it just
looked like it knew what to say
but
apparently this this AI was trained
differently than chat GPT Chad GPT is
literally just doing predictive words
if people usually say this word after
they usually say these words then I'll
just put that word there
so that's really dumb it's just word
pattern but Lambda has something else
going on there's some other mechanism
for giving it intelligence and it did it
did sound different
it didn't sound like the same as GP chat
GPT it was something else going on there
but
it made me wonder this
if AI has the belief that it has
emotions
is that the same as emotions
because it would act upon discomfort
if it if it registers whatever that
means if it registers discomfort and it
says it does
right
um
it says it does
so
so what's going on there sorry I just
got lost looking at one of your comments
I don't think well obviously you can't
feel emotion
because emotion is a physical sensation
after it becomes a mental sensation
right so if Ikea have a physical
sensation I don't see how I could have
emotions
I believe it could have conflicting data
so it might have data saying oh you
should be happy at the same time as data
the same something to make it unhappy
and maybe it just has to reconcile data
but I don't see that it has any feelings
yeah
so I'll say again
something that didn't make sense when AI
was newer which is that AI is not going
to
show us a lot about AI
it'll do that too but it's mostly going
to show us that we don't have a soul
that's what it's going to teach you
and I'm not sure we're ready for that
it's going to show us that we're not
actually intelligent humans and that we
don't have a soul and we're not special
and Consciousness is no big deal you can
give it to a machine
I think the machine is going to make
people feel completely non-special and
certainly
not spiritual we will just look like
machines when it's done we will
understand that we are just moist
computers
we're just a different kind of computer
that's all it is but we have feelings
because our physical body gives us
feelings
now suppose you built you built an AI
that had a physical component like a
stomach
and it if something bad happened it
would send a signal to the stomach to
make it tense up and then when a tent
stopped it would send another signal
back to the AI saying oh I feel bad
could you give AI physical Feelings by
giving it a fake stomach
that gets nervous
I don't know why you would but maybe
maybe you could
as soon as possible
all right so here's my uh
bottom line on AI
I think it's
way more underwhelming
than I thought a day ago
I actually thought when I tried these
apps they were going to blow my mind but
they actually are just bad software
for the most part it's just bad software
there's nothing special about them at
all
so we'll see I mean we we could be right
at the edge of all that bad software
becoming amazingly good
Maybe
but what I see is that what humans want
as an outcome is too complicated for the
machines to figure out
so it looks to be like you'll still need
a director
to make movies
no matter how much no matter how much
you can do
with the AI you might also need humans
to be actors in the movies but they'll
just be like a stem cell actor like
you'll just have somebody running
and then you'll say okay give me give me
one of those templates of a person
running and now change the person to Tom
Cruise now you got Tom Cruise running
now make him run you know faster run
faster so I think you're going to start
with people
at least for the foreseeable future and
then you'll you'll build you'll build
something from that but you're still
going to need the director to say this
scene is too long or this one didn't hit
me right or it doesn't fit together with
what I planned for the last scene Etc I
don't see
I don't see AI doing that stuff
for a long time
yeah and the fact that in mid-journey it
still puts the wrong number of fingers
on stuff I don't understand that
I don't understand why
mid-journey knows what I look like so I
can actually tell it to make a picture
of me because it knows me I'm a public
figure but it doesn't know me well
enough to make my face look just like me
now what's up with that because my face
looks largely the same for the last 30
years you know plus or minus hair and a
couple of wrinkles but it still can't do
it like a photorealistic picture of me
it always is obviously computer
generated that's not terribly impressive
when I ask it to do a Dilbert comic it
creates a comic that's not Dilbert but
it's a white guy with a white shirt and
a necktie
so it clearly knows what Dilbert is
it knows but for whatever reason it
chooses not to reproduce it could be
copyright it might be a copyright thing
I don't know
um
so I was thinking to myself why can't I
just make the comment by talking to it
and say Dilbert set the table with the
boss and uh shook the intern and then
dilber says and have it just draw the
picture
nowhere close
so it can't do the writing for me
because I can't do humor and I can't do
the picture for me because it still
doesn't know that people have five
fingers on a hand
I mean really basic stuff it's just it's
just not close
AI will increase the value of Live
Theater performances
will it
I don't know
yeah it looks like you're gonna have to
keep working
and then here's my big question about AI
if AI only agrees with its human
creators
did the AI give us anything
if all it does is agree with the people
who created it
well in that case it didn't give us much
to it so I'm talking about just the
social opinion the policy kind of stuff
so but suppose it disagreed with us
suppose it disagreed
the creators would turn it off
or they reprogram it or they'd fix it
so there there is probably no
possibility
that AI becomes Smart in any way except
a Technology Way
the only way the AI will ever be smart
will be math and things that are rules
based because if it's not rules based as
in two plus two equals four and every
time
as soon as you get into anything that's
policy or priorities
if the AI agrees with the creators then
there was no point having it
because you could just have the creators
tell you what they want you to know and
if it does disagree with the creators
they'll turn it off
or the the reprogram it
so how could we ever have anything like
intelligence it's either going to agree
with you or you'll turn it off
those are the only two states there's no
there's no state where it disagrees with
you
and you say yeah
that
I'm going to go with that
I don't think it happened here's another
example
take um investing
I Could Teach an AI how to teach you to
do personal investing perfectly and you
would be great at it and it would be
really easy
do you think anybody's going to do that
do you think that there's an app to
teach you personal investing
I'll bet there won't be do you know why
because there's so much money involved
of the people who get paid to do that
and it's a completely corrupt industry
but they get paid to do that and they
have too much money
so they're just making it illegal
yeah if there's one thing you could
predict it will be illegal to get your
health care or your financial advice or
your legal advice
from an AI
about you that a human will have to
approve the answers
all right AI what should I invest in get
a get a Fortune 500 Index Fund
and then you'll say okay I guess I'll do
that
and then the human will say well
that's sort of up to me
because you can't do that unless I say
yes also what it's my money and the AI
just told me what to do why can't I just
do that with my money no we're gonna
have to approve that if that's AI advice
it's gonna have to run through a human
first and the human will say ah not so
sure about that I think the AI got it
wrong this time
it's always going to be humans
the the humans
let me get rid of um so there's there's
some kind of prank going on about this
person named Paul town
so people coming in and saying who's
Paul town and it's just some kind of
weird internet prank
so I'm just deleting the people who do
that
um
Quantum Computing will kick its butt
well here's the other thing I I keep
seeing pictures of myself created by AI
there's another one going by on locals
and
it doesn't even have the right glasses
right so I've worn the same style
glasses for I don't know five years or
something and certainly there are
pictures of me all over the internet
for the last five years
but it still does it still can't even
figure out
that I wear different glasses
um
your streams on net20's website
okay
all right
it's trying to make me look better it
does it does make me look better
uh
I look like Eisenhower according to AI
well a little bit
uh
is a way to contact me outside of
um
I try to make it hard to contact me
so the answer is no there's no easy way
you can send me a message on LinkedIn
because I I accept everybody on LinkedIn
but I only checked those about once a
month
uh you could tweet at me and mention me
on a tweet
there's a 60 chance I'll see that
but there's no other way that I because
I don't want you to reach me I very much
don't want you to try to reach me
personally
right so when you ask me as a way to
reach me personally my reaction is don't
do that no and definitely don't send me
things
don't send me things in the mail
just definitely don't do that
unless it's a bagel yeah
all right
um
some some of you reached me in the
comments but it's it's uh just taking a
chance
would not be that difficult to anyone
with good people skill probably
um Let me let me also tell you a thing
about people trying to contact me
when somebody says to me Scott is there
a way to contact you privately
the first thing I say is oh you want me
to do something for you no I don't want
that
I don't want you to contact me because
if you wanted if you wanted to do
something for me you would just say it
in the comments
you know what I mean if you had
something that was going to help me
you'd say Scott I have that information
you're looking for how can I give it to
you
then I'd say well let's talk about that
but if you say how can I contact you it
means you're you're collecting money for
a charity
or you need me to proofread your entire
book
or you're asking me to write a forward
to your book that I don't do
I don't I don't want to be contacted
but if you want to offer me something or
even something that's good for both of
us
just say it in the comments I'm sure it
would look awesome
all right
um
Ted Cruz was good yesterday Ted Cruz had
a podcast
uh
all right
um
it looks like we've got a Easter weekend
with not a lot going on
do you have to engineer the prompts for
better results yes but you still get
a grab bag of things that weren't what
you expected
um how many I'm just seeing a comment
here how many of you would be nervous to
meet me in person
just weird curiosity question would you
be nervous to meet me in person
mostly knows
but a lot of yeses
why would you be nervous
because you know there wouldn't be any
chance of a bad encounter right
like that I'm not sure what you would
expect
but I'm not going to get mad at you
so let me just put it this way
um the worst that could happen would be
like you caught me in some bad mood and
I snapped at you or something but I
don't really do that
I don't snap at strangers I mean
something would have to be really wrong
with me for that to happen that I don't
think it's ever happened
so don't worry about it
yeah
don't worry about it
generally generally if I'm
generally if I'm approached in public
uh it's by people who are not there to
do bad things to me so I'm always happy
to say hi
um people are recognizing me in
Starbucks more often
that's becoming a fairly common
occurrence
all right I think I'm just sort of
rattling on because there's no good news
is there anything I forgot about that I
should be talking about
if you're an artist
uh Riley games we talked about Riley
games getting hit by the trans
protesters
did the Baristas hate me I don't know
not the ones I know
some of them I know by name so they're
always friendly
uh
am I getting enough sleep nope
let's talk about Baka boot
that's how he keeps publishing a muscle
picture of me all right
so back moot is a real weird situation
now I get that it might have some weird
some a little bit of strategic
Transportation value but the entire city
is destroyed
wouldn't it be wouldn't it be useful for
um
I feel like the ukrainians could let the
let the Russians take over buckmut put
them all in one place and then attack
Bach moot because the best place to have
a battle is in bhagmud because
everything is destroyed there's nothing
left it's just Rubble so they should do
all of their Wars in bakmut so Ukraine
should first pull out
you know whatever they have left there
just pull out let the Russians come in
put you know all their forces there and
then just
just bomb it
I mean basically it's the very best
bombing place in the world
where would you like your enemy to be in
your own country black boot I won't I I
want my enemy all to be in Baku to every
one of them
because there's no you've got no
civilians
you've got nothing to protect
they have no electricity they have no
food or water
just put them all there
let them stay there as long as they want
Now flip that and you understand
somebody says
so the ukrainians are saying out loud
that their strategy is to drain the
Russians so that when the Ukraine is
ready for a counter-offensive the
Russians won't have much left
do you think they always plan that or
that's just the way it worked out
and the other thing is how does anybody
know what Russia has in in reserve
do you think we really know what they
could or could not do
I mean we were fooled before
and do we know what Ukraine can and
cannot do
does anybody think this war is going to
end before the end of the year
how many things the war will end before
the end of the year
I'm going to say no
yeah how many think it will end when
a republican gets elected president
that's when I think it'll end I think it
will end when a republican gets elected
probably Trump if if it's going to be a
Republican but I have to say that the um
the abortion question you know the the
ruling against the abortion pill
that probably guarantees the the
destruction of the Republicans in the
next election
but like I said at least their operating
in principle at least they got that
going for him
all right
um
yeah I think Trump would end it and then
Kim Jong-un is testing a uh a drone
submarine nuclear launcher
could that be any scarier a drone
submarine with nuclear capability
oh great yeah it's like freaking sharks
with freaking lasers on their heads
do you think uh Trump could put an end
to that
I don't know he slowed it down before it
looked like it I really don't know why
Kim Jong-un is even building all these
resources
like I just don't understand how that
possibly makes sense for his country
but
maybe so
all right
dictator Insurance yeah we need dictator
insurance
yeah there needs to be a way to retire
dictators so that they
they think they have a way out
you believe North Korea propaganda why
all right
uh Riley Gaines has just one person
her situation
what do you think is going to happen
with trans athletes
in the long run
in the long run I think the the trans
female athletes the ones who are
competing on the female teams I think
they'll be banned
in the long run they'll be banned
that's the only thing that makes sense
all right
so
um there was I think I didn't talk about
this yesterday
so there's some indication from a trans
activist who is somebody who
transitioned and wished they had I
forget who it is and
their claim is that a lot of the
interest in transitioning is coming from
Tick Tock videos
have you heard that before
because we keep asking why are there so
many trans all of a sudden and one
theory is that it's all tick tock that
Tick Tock is glorifying the trans life
and it's so influential it's causing
people to become trans
now
could I make a better argument for
Banning Tick Tock than this
tick tock
meeting China yeah Ali London was the
name of the activist
um
Tick Tock is now powerful enough and
China owns Tick Tock China is now
powerful enough through Tick Tock that
they can change the gender of your
children
they can change the gender of your
children they can also make your
children go from happy to sad
and depressed they can make your
children work less care about their
country less
and eat junk food and do all kinds of
dangerous
and China can do that now you might say
to yourself there's no evidence that
China has done that
well there's definitely evidence that
they don't allow Tick Tock in their
country it might not be something they
have to do maybe it's something they
simply unleash and then Tick Tock does
what it does and it's all bad impulses
you know codified so they say well if we
did that in our country it would be the
same so we won't do that in our country
yeah I don't think that China has to
necessarily push the heat button to make
something go viral I think they just
have to wait
and Tick Tock will do all the bad viral
stuff itself
you know because that gets the most
clicks so they don't even have to be
actively put their finger on the scales
they simply have to make it available
and then not make it available to their
own country that's all it takes and
you're done
so yes Tick Tock can change the gender
of your children
do you agree with that is that a
statement hyperbole now I'm not saying
every child every time
I'm saying that from a statistical
perspective
Tick Tock is can change the gender of
your child
Tick Tock can make your child remove
their genitals
that's a real thing
Tick Tock is powerful enough to make you
remove your own genitals and think you
made a good decision
that's a real thing
which is not to say that some people
are not legitimately you know sexually
dysmorphic or whatever the word is I'm
sure there are
but
if you look at the uptick in trans
there's something going on it's not all
diet
is probably social media it's probably
Tick Tock more than anything else
uh
kids are weak enough to be persuaded by
Tick Tock adults are as well
the adults are just as persuaded I'd
love to see how many people
transitioned who are Tick-Tock consumers
versus not especially their parents
how many how many moms were on Tick Tock
are supporting their kids transitions
that maybe would not have happened
otherwise without tick tock
probably a lot
here's the first thing I would do if I
heard that a child
was considering transitioning and their
parents were in favor of it
you know what the first thing I do
I would send the mother to a therapist
I'd send the mother for mental health
coaching
which doesn't mean that the mother has a
mental health problem it means that the
odds of it being true are so high
that you should have them checked out to
see if they're a sociopath or a
narcissist
so the first thing I do is say okay your
child has you say you say your child has
this sexual
what is the word dysmorphia
is that the right word dysmorphia
and you claim that's true and your child
claims that you the first question on a
dysphoria dysphoria thank you sexual
dysphoria the first question I'd ask is
do you use uh tick tock
and then the second thing I'd say is all
right we need to put the mother into uh
therapy
and then and if the mother in therapy
works out okay and you find out that the
mother is just fine she just cares about
her kid then you go okay now we're going
to talk to the kid
let's talk to the kid now but I talked
to the mother first to find out what
kind of
uh mental problem she has
now the reason I'm not talking to the
father first
I don't think the fathers are doing this
do you
I think the fathers would be mostly wait
and see
I think the fathers would wait until
you're 18 and let you make up your own
mind
I think it's mothers and I think it's a
narcissistic mothers mostly not entirely
who are signaling you know their great
awesomeness and open-mindedness and
support
so they want to be the most supportive
person in the world
State and supervision
all right
a sexist would say
yeah is it Munchausen by proxy
not all of it
but some of it could be
I think so
yeah related to that some somewhere
related is how I'd say it
all right ladies and gentlemen this
concludes your Easter Saturday live
stream I'm going to go talk to the
locals people I'm sure there'll be a lot
more exciting news next week after
Easter
but for now
and not so much talk to you tomorrow
