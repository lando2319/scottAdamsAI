hey everybody come on in
it's time for the best part of the
entire day
so far it's called the simultaneous sip
well you knew that didn't you and
and uh this time
wow it's gonna be good yeah it'll be the
best simultaneous sip
all day long guaranteed and all you need
is a couple of bags of glass a tanker
chelsea style and a canteen juggerflask
a vessel of any kind and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's gonna happen
now go
oh wow
best one ever i know that's what you're
saying at home
[Applause]
well i had a hypothesis
uh not too long ago that a very
attractive woman
could go in public without a mask
and would not be asked to put one on
just because it's an attractive woman
and christine and i went to safeway
to buy some groceries last night
and didn't notice until we got to the
cashier
that i had worn my mask the entire time
but she had never worn her mask
the entire time she was in the grocery
store
nobody asked her to put a mask on
she gets up to the the cashier and the
cashier is the first person
who who notices she's not wearing a mask
and says something
and the the cash the cashier says
oh you're not wearing a mask you'll
you'll need to put a mask on and we
didn't have an extra wooden with them
and
i said do you have one i thought they
might have spares or something
and they didn't so christina of course
says oh oh you know i'm sorry i'll
i'll go get my mask from the car or i'll
go wait in the car because i was just
checking out anyway
and the the cashier looks at her
and he goes ah don't bother
have you ever seen that in your entire
life
he just looks at her and goes ah don't
bother
but at the same time the the six foot
distance thing
apparently has been removed from my
grocery store
it looks like they're going to the the
three foot kind of situation which
you sort of do automatically because
your cart's in the way
so that i suppose i was a humble brag
and and transparently so but i it was so
funny to see that hypothesis tested
do you know how long i would have gotten
gotten away maskless
i i wouldn't have gotten past the the
entry i would have walked past the
the chips and somebody said hold on you
need to
you need to cover up a lot of that and
not just for a coving either all right
elon musk is
getting some heat from bernie sanders
and others because
he tweeted about collecting resources
to get humanity to the the stars
and people said
what about all the people here on earth
who need help
what about them bernie sanders says
shouldn't you be helping the people
right here on earth instead of
using all these resources to go to mars
and so i was prompted to do a little
informal survey
the non-scientific type on on twitter
i asked people where do billionaires get
their money
do they choice a steal it from the poor
because you know if you want money the
poor is where you go
or did they create it
out of nothing well
nothing is created down nothing as far
as we know but
it's closer to that right why is it that
bernie
uh deserves some of that money that elon
musk
created out of nothing
i don't know what that argument is but i
would make the following argument
uh colonizing space
is the only way that we stay non-chinese
because china is going to colonize space
if we don't
get there first and have a controlling
presence in space
whoever owns space owns owns earth
because if you have the high ground you
you militarily basically control earth
and
i don't know if that's a hundred years
from now but why would you
let that happen if the united states
could keep technical
supremacy and make sure that we don't
lose space
that might be the most important thing
that's happening right now
i would guess that what elon is doing
in terms of the value to humanity you
know for the next
10 million years what elon is doing
is a million times more important than
everything bernie has ever done it's not
even close
in terms of service to humanity
these two are not on the same plane
bernie's service to humanity is pretty
good actually
i would rank him as a productive member
of society
certainly in terms of moving the
arguments and you know changing how we
think about things
but in terms of doing actual stuff
that got done i think musk is the big
winner there
the other the uh andre's back house
tweeted that colonizing mars
might be the best way to protect earth
in case somebody like bernie sanders
ever becomes president
and and andres uh cleverly says as long
as we get all the
keep all the ships the colonization
ships on mars
that an earth run by people like bernie
sanders will never be able to build one
so they'll never be able to get to mars
and cause any trouble
because their technology will never be
able to get to mars
and the fun the reason that's funny
is because it sort of makes sense that
if we don't escape to mars
uh we will be doomed by anything that
happens on earth
so it turns out that trump uh at least
reportedly
is planning to come back in two or three
months with his own media platform
yay how much fun are we gonna have when
trump comes back with his own media
platform
now i don't know what that will look
like but i have to think it's a video
based
something maybe you can post things
maybe you can
tweet on it or whatever is the
equivalent of tweeting
so we'll all be waiting for that that'll
be fun
kind of makes you wonder who would be
part of that platform
doesn't it because i don't know if it
can happen in two or three months
because i haven't heard of anybody who's
been approached have you
uh if you've been approached by this
whatever this new platform is to be part
of it
unless it's just trump himself which is
entirely possible
but if anybody's been approached to be
part of any kind of a trump media thing
let me let me know tweet at me or dm me
or something
um here is an idea
that will sound crazy
until you think about it are you ready
this will sound like the worst idea
and then it's just going to sort of sit
there for a while until it sounds good
to you
you know how in business when you sign a
contract
it's fairly common snickers quiet over
there
it's fairly common in business to sign a
contract with a clause in it
that says if you have a dispute it will
be solved by mediation
now mediation
i got to do something about my dog
all right wake up yeah there we go now
mediation
means that you're going to get a result
from a mediator somebody does that for a
living
that will not make either side happy in
all likelihood right
it might make one of them happy and the
other unhappy but it's probably going to
be some
some middle ground compromise sort of
thing
no i didn't throw the kleenex box at her
i just wanted her to hear it
um so
here's my crazy idea
we're watching the democrats and
republicans be unable to govern
because now they have um yeah
arbitration so it's called arbitration
yes
and so the democrats and the republicans
can't get anything done because they
don't want to vote for the other side
and therefore not much can get done what
would happen if
we had a mediator or an arbitrator
somebody who would say all right this is
an important issue i'll take one that we
haven't dealt with as much
let's say transportation
some kind of a infrastructure bill
all right just to pick something that's
maybe upcoming
what would happen if the democrats and
republicans just couldn't decide
they just couldn't decide so what do you
do just have
no bill that doesn't work because that's
where we're not we are now right
just nothing happens but what would
happen if the democrats and the
republicans
under some trigger say all right we
can't work this out
and just give it to the arbitrator and
say this is what we think
the other side says this is what we
think but here's the key
the democrats and republicans would have
to agree in advance
to accept the decision and then suddenly
somebody says basically joe manchin that
basically he's the arbitrator right
joe manchin gets to decide because he's
the only one who will cross
cross lines
now okay here's here's the question i'm
anticipating who elects
the mediators or the arbitrators because
then you'd have a situation where all of
our elected representatives
would be neutered and an unelected
person would make the decision
but wait it's not a problem
because the elected people would be
selecting they would have selected
the arbitrator so it's a process
by which the elected people decide in
advance
that this is how they'll make a decision
but it would still be the elected people
who had created the system that created
the the the outcome
it would just be a reasonable person
making the decision
who is neither democrat nor republican
in terms of bias
watch how that idea sounds
bad crazy when you first hear it
and it's going to sort of gnaw you over
time
because as long as the democrats and
republicans both agree
to let the arbitrator arbitrate
it would work and i'm seeing in the
comments there's like a real hesitation
because somebody says it's not
constitutional i disagree
you could make it constitutional simply
by having the republic the republicans
and democrats
agree to abide by it because they could
simply change their mind and that gives
them full control
you know so they don't have to they
would just agree to it
now how is that different than you know
stuff getting worked out in committee
it's not a lot different right um
so watch how that one gets better over
time
so on my ongoing series of trump will
look
better every day that he's gone
um did you know that the trump
administration
did allow photojournalists into the
juvenile migrant detention centers but
biden does not
think about that the trump
administration
with their so-called kids in cages
allowed
the journalists to come in and take
pictures
and interview people and stuff and
biden's not doing that
that's basically the uyghur
concentration camp
situation right do we have more photos
of uyghur concentration camps
or of these migrant detention facilities
for children
yeah i saw the project veritas video and
there's some other photographs
that came out today and it seems that
they're being kept in
these clear plastic sided
containers but they're not boxes because
they have an open top
they're kind of cubicles if you look at
them
they're cubicles with a door and i
thought to myself
wait a minute if we're keeping kids in
cubicles
at the same time that remote office work
is becoming a big thing
aren't there hundreds of thousands of
empty cubicles just sitting there in
rented space with nobody in them
why can't we put those kids in cubicles
do you feel me in all seriousness
is there any reason we can't use office
space that's been abandoned
they got bathrooms they've got
containers called cubicles
and what would be funniest about that is
we can all complain about kids in cages
justifiably
we can all complain about kids in boxes
kids in any kind of custody
we can all complain about that but what
would happen
if those kids were put in a modern
uh in a modern office building
in cubicles
right now you don't need a door on every
cubicle
as long as you're guarding the exterior
exits
i feel as if you could put kids in
cubicles and it would end the problem
because we wouldn't be able to complain
that living in cubicles was inhumane
you could give each kid their own
cubicle we probably have plenty of them
now i'm just you know i don't think
anything like this will happen but
putting kids in hotels
doesn't seem like the right answer does
it because that's what they're doing now
they're putting them in hotels but i
suppose a hotel has a shower so that's
an advantage
all right rasmussen poll says two-thirds
of the public say we have a border
crisis
two-thirds of the public now
i i don't think i've ever seen a
president fail harder than this have you
do we have any history of a president
coming into office
implementing a policy the the
immigration policy in this case
and failing spectacularly in the first
30 to 60 days has that ever happened
what would be the another example of a
worst
start for a president can you think of
one
because presidents usually start off
pretty well right
usually the first honeymoon period
somebody says bush
but what did bush do in the first 30 to
60 days
i don't think anybody's had a worse
start this might be the
oh 9 11.
was 9 11 in the first two months of bush
yeah i don't know all right
here's a question that you think we
ought to know the answer to but
according to social media
the the final final word on everything
uh
we don't so
uh i saw these uh tweets going around
this morning about israel's
outcomes and if you look at the israeli
data
of vaccinations versus outcomes it seems
pretty clear that the vaccinations
started and then the the
hospitalizations and deaths
plunged as soon as they started getting
enough people vaccinated
so you say to yourself well it obviously
works
because the vaccinations came the deaths
and hospitalizations plunged
what else do you need to know well i
thought that that sounded pretty good
and especially because the the rate of
vaccinations within different age groups
seems to map perfectly to show that the
more vaccinated you are
the faster the curb falls just like
you'd expect
but but
it didn't take long for people to say
well here's my chart of
other countries who have exactly the
same curve and they're not vaccinating
much at all
to which i say damn it
damn it again
we actually is it true that we can't
tell if the vaccinations are working
and that we'll never know when i say
we'll never know i don't mean that
science won't decide
that they know but i feel the public has
already made
a move and said it doesn't matter what
data you show us
we're just not going to believe those
vaccinations made any difference
yeah i think i would agree with who the
commenter who's saying it's a little too
soon
i feel as if we should know for sure in
two months right
but as somebody pointed out the spanish
flu went away and they didn't have a
vaccine
so why did it go away apparently it was
not because of herd
immunity we don't know why the spanish
flu went away and here's the kicker
we don't know why any virus goes away
which was the most amazing thing i
learned early on in the pandemic
that we don't know why the seasonal flu
goes away
it just does now the only thing that
makes sense is that some people have
some natural immunity for one reason or
another i can't think of any other
reason
that a virus would go away without
immunity and without a vaccination
but
do you believe that we don't have data
yet to know the vaccinations work
we were able to apparently we can
measure the amount of antibodies
i mean it certainly looks like we can
measure it
but a number of people showed me graphs
where other countries that are not doing
much actually the united states is not
doing as well
on vaccinations but our curve looks the
same
so how do you explain that how do you
explain that countries not vaccinating
are also having a big drop at about the
same time
the amount of stuff we don't know about
this is just stunning
um i heard somebody who knew what they
were talking about
a doctor told me that one of the
problems with counting the regular
seasonal flu
influenza deaths are that we count them
as an influence of death
if it's sort of the last thing that
happened before they died
so if somebody gets influenza and then
the influenza
you know is taken care of but a few days
later they die
of let's say something related maybe
it's pneumonia or something
that that would get counted as a
influenza death
even if they died with no influenza in
them
the thought is that they were weakened
to the point where
it's the proximate cause but
does that make sense because here's
another way to look at it
it seems to me that anybody who dies
i'll take an average 80 year old person
aren't they dying for all the reasons
they're dying for all the reasons one of
the reasons is
they didn't eat well during their entire
life didn't have a good diet
another reason is they didn't exercise
enough
another reason is that they were born
with a certain genetic
you know uh genetic propensity for
things
and then there were all the decisions
they made in life did they smoke
cigarettes
did they do this or did they do that
don't you need every one of those things
to happen
on top of the influenza in order to kill
a person
but because the the last thing you saw
was the influenza
we say that's the thing that killed you
but if you would say removed
any of the other major parts i mentioned
let's say you had always eaten well
if you went back in time and changed
that variable and now you're
you're thin but you're older
do you still die would you still die
if you wouldn't then it wasn't the
influenza that killed you
right it was your bad diet over years
and years
or your lack of exercise or you know you
didn't take your vitamin d
or whatever right so it seems to me
illogical to say that the last thing
that happened sort of the final straw
is the one that broke the camel's back
it's just the one that happened last
it's not like a car accident where the
car accident definitely killed you
right and it's not like cancer
necessarily
because the cancer kills you i suppose
you could argue that your lifestyle
might have
contributed to that too
and then there's a question of whether
you can count this stuff i saw a tweet
this morning that somebody claiming we
already know that
half a million extra people died in 2020
but i don't think we know that
i feel like we don't know the death
count for 2020
but if anybody has that link send it to
me i think that's estimated
so here's the other factor have you ever
noticed that
if you're if you can't find your phone
or your keys
where are they always the thing you
can't find
where is it always it's always in the
last place you look
right if you can't find your keys it's
in the last place you would look
and the last place you do look now
of course i'm being silly because if you
find your keys
that is the last place you look you
don't need to look anymore you found
your keys
and so how many people
who are let's say within a year of dying
get the influenza and then
because just the order of things
death comes after do you know it's
harder to die
first and then get the influenza after
you're dead
i'm no doctor but i think that's a safe
sentence
so suppose it's flu season
and people are going to get the flu
old people some of them get the flu
within a few weeks of
a death but maybe they were gonna die
anyway
and the flu maybe pushed it up a few
days or a few weeks i don't know
but is that really the cause of death if
you were only a few weeks away from
death
because it seems to me that just the the
coincidental timing
of people getting the flu and then they
were going to die anyway
i feel like that would get a little over
counting going on
but i'm not sure so
the quality of our data on everything
from influenza
to mass to distancing to vaccinations
we're at a point where we don't believe
anything and maybe we don't
yeah and i don't think influenza the
regular influenza is even
based on uh death certificates i think
it's some kind of weird estimate
all right apparently biden's department
homeland
department of homeland security
secretary insists that the border is
closed
and it's under control except
for lone children so
that's the biden administration says
that the it's closed except for lone
children
so the question i ask you is why
why does the biden administration not
want adults to come in
is it because he's racist
because it seems pretty racist to close
your border and not let
one brown person in who's an adult come
on
are there any white people you're
keeping out
from crossing the southern border well a
few maybe who
came from europe and tried to get in
that way but mostly
biden is keeping the brown people from
crossing the border and i don't think we
can ignore that
of course that's what would be said if
it were trump um
yeah it's ageism it's ageism
exactly that's exactly what it is
now how would you
how would you regard the joe biden
kids and cubicles problem if the press
had been able to
report on it and if biden had been
completely transparent
about how bad it was i feel as if i
would have taken that completely
differently
imagine if you will that biden had said
exactly the opposite of what he said
which is
yeah you know because i said we were
going to be kind to children
it totally causes more children to come
here unaccompanied
i that's that's all on me but
the alternative is worse and i'm going
to show you what we're doing
we're not prepared i wish we were
it's going to get ugly down there but
we're going to prepare as fast as we can
so we're going to let the
photojournalists and the journalists
talk to everybody you see how bad it is
it's as bad as you think it is take a
picture
we're working as hard as we can to fix
it
i feel like that would have that would
have felt different to me
that would have felt like we've got a
bad problem
and nobody has a good idea or the the
immediate resources for solving it
and then i would say okay at least
that's honest maybe maybe i wouldn't
have played it that way
but at least it's honest right i'll take
that
but it feels like biden has given us a
bad situation
and then on top of it made it
non-transparent
oh that's not good that's not good
all right
um southern states should form a
sanctuary coalition somebody's saying
to fix this themselves i don't know how
they do that
somebody says boy you are easy
well don't get me wrong um i think that
trump's policy on the border was the
smart one
and it feels like we're going to end up
back there eventually
so um i i do think
well let me say right out loud i'll say
out loud what people don't want to say
if we don't make it really hard for
children
too many of them will come and that
won't be good for them either
so i'll say what most adults don't want
to say is we have to
probably make it really really bad for
kids otherwise the situation gets out of
control
unfortunately we live in a cruel world
and having
having uh you know boundaries and
borders and
rules and laws and stuff like that we
don't really have an option for that
stuff
it's not like you can just accept them
or not accept them
we need to be able to say out loud and
by the way if i were president i would
say that out loud
i would say just the way i'm saying now
i would say
look we want to be good to kids but
we need to make it hard on them
otherwise
we'll have a worse situation now one of
the things that i wonder about is
whether this migrant crisis is going to
hurt us or help us
um don't you assume that
tens of thousands of uh unaccompanied
minors crossing the border you kind of
assume it's bad don't you
for the economy but i don't know
i actually don't know it might not be
because um
and i would need i think i would need a
little help on the economics decision
here
let's say let's say that humans
have different economic values
if a an 80 year old immigrant coming
came across the border
i would say that's going to be expensive
because the 80 year old is not going to
work probably but might have health
problems might be a burden
but what happens if a if a 14 year old
comes across the border
a 14 year old probably has a good chance
of learning
english well enough by the time they're
an adult they're probably going to get
you know an upgrade in education
and the odds of them becoming productive
citizens is pretty good
you know most countries need an influx
of young people
no matter how they get them or else your
economy
stalls out so we don't have a choice of
having lots of young people
and you can either give birth to them or
or bring them in from immigration
but young people are like gold as humans
go
as human beings go
mexico sent us their best
that i think that's the truth you know
trump is famous for saying they're not
ascending their best
that's the adults right because the
adults include
cartel members and stuff like that now i
disagree with trump
that they're not ascending their best i
very much disagree with that
he's certainly true that their criminal
elements are coming across the border
but i think actually mexico is sending
their best
uh in this one sense that the adults who
are coming
don't count the cartel members and the
ms-13
but the adults who are coming to work
are the boldest
healthiest they're the ones who can make
it
they're the risk takers the
entrepreneurs
we might accidentally be siphoning off
mexico's most valuable asset
which is their best people now not best
in terms of
educational attainment but that's maybe
you know one generation away
so i'm just gonna ask the question is
there an economist out there who's
looked at the questions specifically
if you were to take the the children
and they were the only migrants would
you come out ahead
or behind now keep in mind that each of
these migrants will go
stay with somebody so they're not going
to be homeless
for the most part they'll they'll be
taken care of by some kind of entity
and we'll see
uh they're from central america not
mexico for the most part
yeah i should add that i should add that
correction
there are more from central america than
mexico that is correct thank you for
that
thank you for that upgrade
um who pays the schools for them so
here's where you need the
the economist so certainly
the children will create some costs
there'll be some extra health care costs
there'll be school costs
they'll be you know a burden in a number
way so the question is not that they
present costs it's obvious that they do
the question is will they
create more benefit than they've added
in costs
and i would say you should be no
different than our own children
right we send our own children to school
it costs money
um i'm paying for your children to go to
school
right why is it fair that i'm paying for
your children to go to school
so maybe you might pay for somebody
else's children to go to school too
and as will i i just don't know if this
is economic plus or minus
if you think you know the answer this
i'll bet you don't
i bet you don't remember we don't know
if masks work
i mean i think they do but you know the
the state of our data is just terrible
that we're arguing about mass and social
distancing and lockdowns in schools
we're arguing about vaccines now for of
all things
we're arguing about everything so
do you think that you know
that migrant children are economically
negative
because i will take that bet without
seeing what the economists say
you know sight unseen i will take the
bet
that the children are almost always
on an average are almost always positive
economically
i don't know now i do know that it's
terrible for the south american
or the central american countries
because essential american countries
i was watching uh was it the
leader of i forget one of the central
american countries
was saying that their their product is
exporting people
they don't have a they don't have a
functioning economy
because if you're exporting your people
that's your worst situation
so their their best brightest healthiest
youngest people are all leaving
that's bad that's really bad
so how could it be true
i suppose it could be true but you've
got a situation where if it's bad for
where they're leaving that they're
leaving
isn't that because they have an economic
value that's the whole point right
they have a future economic value that's
quite substantial
so i think we should make a big
distinction between
taking the central american kids
which might be like free money
it might be free money it just doesn't
feel like it
taking adults well they're going to
start taking jobs and such
right that's a different situation and
some of them are criminals and some of
them are older
blah blah now i suppose the chain
migration is still an issue so i don't
know how
how you calculate that because the young
kids will eventually be able to
do some chain migration of their
relatives i guess
i think that's the way it is
all right my dog's snoring too loudly
and that's
that's uh somebody says legal only
yeah so legal would be the first choice
right
but in effect the biden administration
has legalized
on unattended migrant children
so in effect it's legal it's just not
technically legal
um somebody's saying that saucy says
trump people don't like educated people
i think that's kind of true that's kind
of true
i do think that trump supporters
don't trust experts and academics and
elites and
harvard graduates etc you know it's not
a it's not a universal thing but
i think i think there's something to
that um
okay i saw the i saw an insensitive joke
that i can't decide if it's racist
so i'm gonna i'm gonna recount it and
then this will be your test case is the
following
joke funny
and actually supports the the migrants
or is it making fun of the migrants and
therefore is racist
and here's the joke and i won't tell you
who said it because in case you think
it's racist
he doesn't need any more trouble right
so somebody you know
from social media said that the
the kids in cages because they they all
have this foil
aluminum foil looking blankets
and he said that it was making all the
kids look like uh
gas station burritos
i just don't know how to respond to that
one
because i laughed as soon as i realized
oh yeah
a burrito is wrapped in that you know
that tin foil thing
and there's pictures of all these kids
wrapped in tin foil
and they're from south america
or they're from central america so you
think to yourself
burrito but is that racist
tell me is it racist or is it just
offensive
like where's that line between offensive
and racist because i will tell you that
i'm pretty sure the person who said it
was not in favor of any children of any
kind suffering in any way
so certainly you know nobody had any bad
feelings about the children
and i don't think anybody had any racial
animosity
but it's right on the line there isn't
it it's sort of right on the line of
you hear it you go i don't know if i
would have said that in public
the only reason i can say it in public
is that i'm talking about it
if i just said it as a joke i think i'd
have to pay for that probably um
somebody says gas stations sell burritos
i i think the ones with um yeah
i think they do actually depends on your
gas station
um
all right well at least people are
laughing at it
you know you don't want to laugh at any
group
who are suffering so
but i don't know if the children are all
that suffering
one of the questions that's never asked
is
are the the migrant children who are in
these
containers um
let's say it even lasts for a week
however long it lasts it's only supposed
to be 72 hours but let's say it lasts a
week
what was their life like before they got
in that cage
how many of them are actually happier in
the cage
i mean nobody wants to stay in the cage
forever but how many of them are
actually
physically better fed warmer
safer from crime than they were
every day of their life until they got
in the cage again
i'm not pro cage right i'm just saying
that if you're using your um your
elite uh let's say you're using your
elite american filter
to say my god if i went if i left my
current life
and had to be wrapped in tin foil and
laying on a
mattress in a container next to the
border
that would be the worst day ever for me
but that's not them i think they're
going from a
horrible situation which is why they
came here
to a situation which looks horrible by
our standards but might not be that bad
compared to where they were a week ago
right so i'm not saying that the
the cages are humane or that they're
good
i think we should all just have a
general feeling that you don't want to
pick
put kids in containers and you don't
want you don't want to put kids in jail
of any kind right
if you could avoid it but maybe you
can't avoid it if you can't avoid it you
can't avoid it
somebody says the conditions for those
kids might be better than boot camp
might be i say definitely
don't you think that a typical of
volunteer
military person who goes through boot
camp
has a worse time in boot camp in terms
of physical
comfort than any of the migrants who are
kept in cages for three days
again don't want anybody in a cage
it's just we got to put it in
perspective
so the perfect situation would be that
we treated everybody humanely but
somehow everybody believed we didn't
so the ideal situation is to
let reality and uh and persuasion
decouple treat the kids humanely
but tell everybody it's a living hell
and they better not come
all right
somebody's making a bad pun instead of
quesadillas
kids ideas all right let's not be
offensive
um somebody's calling them
aoc burritos
you're you're right on the edge of being
you know racist by modern standards you
know so far you're just being offensive
and and by the way um
i always i make this uh
i try to make this distinction
rarely do you see a comment that's
actually racist even the ones that
people are getting canceled et cetera
we've we've come to believe that
offensive
something that bothers somebody is also
racist
but i would argue they're rarely the
same i would say that most times
most of the things that people say that
they get canceled for
are meant to be offensive slash funny
they're not meant to change the law to
racism
it's not meant to discriminate it's not
it's even not meant to
it's not meant to make anybody's life
worse
it's just defensive like a lot of humor
is
all right somebody said what happened to
the dill burrito
so the dill burrito uh was a
a burrito i made years ago and tried to
mark it
because i had all the vitamins and
minerals you needed for the day
but there were a few problems number one
the food industry
is crooked and so when we would go on a
shelf
there was a certain company who shall
remain nameless who would send their
people in to put their products in front
of it
so we would actually sell zero zero
units
because nobody would even know it was in
the store so
we got into you know big so we got into
7-eleven
and costco and walmart and we got into
all the big stores
but nobody ever saw it and uh
yeah you you're making a good guess
in the uh in the comments and
the other problem is that the the
product uh didn't have the repeat
customers
that we hoped because the product itself
made you repeat
oh did it make you repeat
[Laughter]
you know this is sort of a classic thing
of course we we tested them all and i
think everybody who who tested their
prototypes said oh these are tasty
and then we would go off and have you
know intestinal distress
but you kind of think it's just you
right like
you don't think it's the product you
think oh maybe my body doesn't respond
to the
spicy food or something but the
feedback from the customers was
[Laughter]
is the feedback from the customers
that apparently this product made you
far more than
more than any product of all time
somehow this product got all the way
through the testing you know we
we all ate it and tested it we and we
all had the same experience
like privately and individually we all
had like
the worst heart attack you've ever had
in your life but i think
i think all of us individually didn't
talk about it and we just figured well
this is my body
like you know it's it's just you know
one of those things
didn't really think didn't really think
it was the quality of the product so
much just thought of something about me
and then you find it
they put it out there basically you
could eat that thing once
destroy all your furniture
that's what that's one of my best
failures
of all my failures i think i like that
one the best
because it's so ridiculous oh god
obviously that's all that's all i've got
uh we could probably just feed those
dill burritos to uh
to pigs to make methane
i think we could fuel a major city with
you know two
with two two deal burritos and a couple
of pigs so you'd have all the methane
you ever need
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you later
ah all right i'm a mess
that's all for now i'll talk to you
tomorrow
