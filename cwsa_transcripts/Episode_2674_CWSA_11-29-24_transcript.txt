morning it looks like the stock market
is off to a nice little
run Tesla's
up all right not too bad even rumbles up
today I think we're uh going to have the
best show
ever might not be obvious why but it's
because everything's
awesome and you're going to have a good
time just wait you just wait
all right almost
ready good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
darn it you've never had a better time
but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains
all you need for that is a cuper Mugger
glass tager CH Stein a canteen Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine h of
the day thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go Delicious By the way if you're
listening later on Spotify where this
gets it's uploaded after I'm done I I
hear the commercials are insanely
loud compared to the content I don't
think that happens any on the other
platforms so you could always listen on
a different
platform um because the studio I'm using
only sends one audio signal to all the
all the different
platforms so oh it doesn't send it to
Spotify though does
it I guess ify is adding the commercials
on the platform so I'm not sure how to
fix that but I'll look into it well you
would not be surprised according to s
poost that whole coffee Cherry extract
supplement might improve working memory
now you might say to me what is a coffee
cherry and how do you take the Cherry
from the coffee and the answer is a
cherry is the the coating to the uh to
the Coffee Bean I guess and normally
when you drink coffee they remove that
part but the part they remove is
awesome it's awesome so apparently if
you were to eat the part that remove
you'd have good working memory now I
don't take a chance so what I do is I
grow a Coffee Tree in my
backyard and then every morning I just
go out and I lick the bark you know the
leaves and I definitely eat all the
cherries so that's what what I do uh
this would be a good time to remind you
not to take any
medical advice from me not
once by the way if you notice behind
me where you can almost read it there
are the one two three four five best
things you could buy as a
gift I I I actually promise you that if
you know somebody who likes reading
books at least one of these books is
going to work for everybody you can hit
every every every person if it's
somebody who doesn't know anything about
me and doesn't know anything about
Dilbert you want to go for the reframe
your brain that just works for everybody
and had failed almost everything and
still went big those are guaranteed to
make them happy if they're political and
they like stuff like how to learn
persuasion win bigle is the book and if
they're philosophical and they like to
think about the nature of reality itself
then God's debris the complete works
would be the way to go and if they are
Dilbert um fans but they don't care
about the politics or the persuasion
then get the 2025 Dilbert calendar now
the important thing is that the calendar
is only available at a link you can find
at dilbert.com the books are on Amazon
so if you want the book just search
Amazon they'll all pop
up but the calendar I would get that
right away because I can't guarantee
that if you get it a week before
Christmas it's going to show up right so
I wouldn't wait on the calendar we're
making those as we as we get orders so
so sooner is better
anyway um scientists according to no
Ridge have made magic polymers that can
pull water from the thin air with less
energy so there's all kinds of um all
kinds of scientific breakthroughs in
creating water out of the air but it all
takes
energy and this one takes way less
energy so it's not it's not going to you
know power your city but it might help
you in an
emergency well there's the first asthma
treatment breakthrough in half a century
according to Kent live news it's a game
changer they say some kind of
vaccination they say will substantially
decrease your asthma attacks well I
don't know might take a couple years
before that works its way through the
system we'll see I'm I'm a skeptical of
everything um there is a Prebiotic
supplement of some something called
inulin and of course frul gasa
sakade pretty sure I pronounced that
exactly right and it boosts brain
function in old people h huh but here's
the interesting part what it does is it
changes your gut
chemistry and here's an actual sentence
from the article see if this sounds
familiar to
you uh quote evidence for the close
relationship between the gut and the
brain is growing year after year now
watch this part see if this sounds like
me some experts are now so convinced by
the results they refer to the gut as the
body's second
brain what do I tell you almost every
day almost every day I tell you that
your body is your brain there's no such
thing is the brain in its own little
closed off area and then your body is
your body no your body is your brain it
if you don't have all that chemistry
right in your body your brain isn't
working period so your your brain and
your body are one
tool all right uh reportedly Elon Musk
is going to use his AI called X Ai and
do a little Standalone app so right now
it only exists in in X as grock but
they're going to make their own
Standalone as far as I can tell it seems
way behind chap
GPT because Gro so far doesn't have
images is and it doesn't have ability to
talk to it you there's a lot it doesn't
do I don't know if it's going to catch
up I keep I keep seeing stories that say
that Elon musk's version is going to
catch up to Chad
GPT but it doesn't look like it's
happening so I mean it could happen
quickly if they you know make some big
change I suppose but I don't know
meanwhile the oceans cooled the planet
more than we thought but also according
to no
Ridge um so turns out that the ocean
gives off some kind of sulfur gas and
that hadn't been totally understood and
that sulfur gas cools the climate more
than previously thought so what they're
doing is they're going back to all their
climate models and now they're using
this new knowledge about the sulfur
that's coming out of the ocean and how
it cools things to modify their
models now here's an interesting
question why do they need to modify the
models I've been told quite reliably
that 98% of all scientists say the
models are telling us enough of what we
need to know I mean nothing's perfect
but they're telling us enough of what we
need to know that we can put trillions
and trillions of dollars into it
so why do we need to fix the
models uh I thought you told me the
model models already
worked cuz you asked me for trillions of
dollars
so why do I have a new story every
single day about a new variable that
they didn't know about that's very large
and so they're incorporating it into the
models any of you who have lived in the
real world as long as I have you know
what that means right if you have a
model that's telling you the truth and
then you keep changing the model by by
adding variables almost every week and
the variables are kind of big and no
matter what you do you still get the
same
answer if if you're 25 you think that
means that climate change is real and
they've got a real good bead on
it when you're 65 the fact that they
change it every week tells you that they
don't know what they're
doing it's a it's a real big difference
in experience
am I right th those of you who are older
and have experience when you see that
they're adding a new variable to their
complicated models and they're adding it
every week and they're big they're big
variables that tells you it's
 there's no other explanation
there there literally is no other
explanation but if you're young you just
think oh the models were good before and
they're getting
better no that's not what's happening
all right uh meanwhile according to
Daily Caller news
Foundation the America's most expensive
uh Dei program is about to go away so
apparently the University of Michigan
had this uh they've they've spent $250
million on Dei since
2016 and students and faculty have
reported
deteriorating campus climate
um racism is worse they have exactly the
same percentage of black
enrollment and they got absolutely
nothing out of it except people feeling
bad about each
other so that's what they got for $250
million hey does anybody know how they
could have saved $250
million is there anything they could
have done anybody they could have asked
hey we just need your advice should we
spend $250 million on
this well they should have asked Scott
because I would have told
them you know if you divide people into
groups and say that one of those groups
is the oppressor and one group is the
victim uh what's going to happen
huh what's going to happen use my giant
brain to predict into the future you
divide people into groups and you make
won the oppressor and won the victim how
does that turn
out oh you wasted your $250 million
that's a quarter of a
billion do you think that uh University
could have done anything useful with a
quarter of a billion dollars like
teaching classes better and paying
teachers more stuff like that well
anyway the uh University is talking
about Shak handing the whole thing
because the program created quote a
culture of grievance huh who could have
seen that coming a culture of
grievance maybe they should have asked
me well you can see that it's all
happening now if the biggest I think the
biggest employer isn't is Walmart the
biggest employer outside the government
so the government is the biggest
employer they're going to get rid of Dei
under Trump
uh if you count the military they're
going to get rid of Dei Walmart I don't
know if they're the biggest company at
least employment wise but they're
getting they got rid of Dei and now the
largest in the University World in terms
of spending and how much attention they
gave it looks like they're talking about
just getting rid of it
entirely everything's going my
way all right meanwhile according to the
hill America's opinion of the Republican
party is on the rise and America's
opinion of the Democrats is on the
decline why well I don't know but in the
poll 45% Americans said they feel
favorable toward the Republicans now
still under 50% so it's not the best in
the world but 45% how is that compared
to how they people feel about Democrats
oh
not so well so uh GOP went
um uh who said they felt unfavorable oh
so both the GOP went down a little bit
but it's still bigger than the Democrats
so Democrats are 39% had a good good
feeling about their
party and uh more Republicans like their
party that makes sense I mean nobody's
surprised by that right
Joe Rogan made a little news again as
he's as he does you know I'll tell you
the thing about Joe
Rogan that is the least
appreciated is the mistakes he doesn't
make so you know how the dog not barking
is the one you don't
notice the the mistakes that could
easily be made that Joe Rogan doesn't
make it's kind of
impressive I I'm more and more of the
opinion that Joe Rogan is just one of
the smartest people we've ever seen in
the public sphere but part of what makes
him smart is he doesn't act smart like
he doesn't you know rub it in your face
or you know wear a you know wear a robe
or
something he he just lives his life but
if you sort of follow him for years as I
have and many of you have where are all
the dumb things have you noticed there's
no dumb things like everybody who talks
that much to that many people they're
going to have some dumb stuff in their
catalog
right that the dumbest thing that Joe
Rogan has done has turned out to be
right you know like taking Ivon and
stuff like that so even the things he
was criticized for the
most well kind of turned out right but
here's another one apparently
zalinski uh wanted to come on Joe
Rogan's podcast
and according to Rogan he said zalinsky
tried to come on yeah they tried to get
zalinsky on he says I was like what are
you talking about and he does sort of a
weird voice because he's just joking
what are you talking about so that was
exactly the right
response no don't put zilinski on Joe
Rogan show so Rogan quite correctly
realized this was a prop aganda run and
nothing good could come from it now
remember he he wanted to talk to both
the presidential candidates so if it was
American Business and it was you know
political he was all in he had you know
Bernie Sanders on but zalinski is not
like the others he's just pure
propaganda so Rog is like
no again if he if he had never told you
that
story that
zalinski pitched it and he said no I
mean think about how big the ratings
would have been it's not like he was
unaware that the ratings would have been
you know Monumental of course they would
have been and he's still and he still
said
no that was the right answer I I think
he I think he got the right answer
there uh let's talk about Putin so
Putin's psychology game is uh
I I was going to say second to none but
it might be second to Trump one of the
reasons that I think those two Bond a
little bit you know as adversaries but
they bond is that they're both so good
at the
psychology just listen to what Putin
says and I'm not going to try to
convince you that Putin means every word
he says and it's all completely honest
right we don't have to have that
conversation right we we don't need any
NPCs stor me in saying oh you're Putin's
puppet how could you believe what Putin
said no nothing like that's going to
happen I'm going to tell you what Putin
said I'm going to tell you what effect I
think it had but I'm not going to tell
you that Putin's the smartest person in
the world and everything he says is true
and we should do what he says right so
NPCs calm down calm down you can handle
this
right so here are some of the things
Putin said I guess he was at some event
made some news he said that Trump is
intelligent and he will find a solution
to the Ukraine war so interesting Trump
gets criticized for calling Putin smart
and capable and his critics say what how
can you compliment that monster don't
you know he's your enemy stop saying
good things about him but there's the
enemy allegedly Putin and he's doing the
same thing he's returning the compliment
that's a pretty big compliment you know
if if Putin says that you're intelligent
and you're going to find a solution to
the war like almost matter of factly
whereas the current president did not
find a solution to the war and it
doesn't look like there was any chance
that was ever going to
happen you you can see that Putin's
trying to get on the good side of trump
now do you think Putin has a
Intel that if he Praises Trump and makes
him his ego feel good that he might get
a better
deal of course he does because literally
every person in America says Trump just
listens to the last person in the room
and whoever kisses his ass the most now
do you think anybody really knows
that no do you do you know why Trump
listens to the last person in the
room does anybody know
why CU at some point you have to be
done you you have to be done make a
decision at some point it's sort of like
you you find the lost thing in the last
place you look because the last place
you look is where you found it so
there's no place to look after you've
found it so when the last PE person
leaves the
room that's when he realizes that he's
made a decision because now he's heard
both sides but now he's heard the side
he likes he wants to hear that one more
time that's the one you want to hear
before you make your decision the one
that you were leaning toward just to
make sure it still sounds good so yes it
should be completely
normal that in general you're going to
agree with the last person out of the
room it's probably pretty normal doesn't
mean every time but bet a lot of times
it's just the most normal way that
anything
Works however let's see
sorry
um he Putin said he was ready for peace
talks with Ukraine without
preconditions but on the same terms he
laid out over the summer which are
preconditions so Putin says he wants to
have a talk without preconditions as
long as we're taking all the
preconditions into consideration the
preconditions would be Ukraine decides
not to be part of
NATO and that um basically Putin keeps
the four areas that he already conquered
and he already owns basically so that
sounds like exactly the deal we all know
is going to
happen so that's interesting Putin also
said that he thinks Trump's life is in
danger was in danger and is now and uh
even the cab members at risk you know
that Tom Holman and at least someone
else who was a cabinet pick got some
death threats over the
weekend so things are looking dangerous
and Putin is
warning um that uh that there's a
genuine threat to
Trump uh so here's what I want to know
do you think that Putin's intelligence
in other words his Intel departments do
you think that they know enough about
the American
government that they know that the
Democrats are planning or somebody is
planning to try to kill
Trump because there's no way we would
know whether he is just saying that for
a fact or if he actually has
information because he wouldn't want to
give away that he has information
because that would give away his sources
and methods
right so the thing I wonder
is does Putin know more than we do about
the threat now here again I compliment
Putin for his psychology game without
being a supporter of him because he's a
terrible terrible murderer of
people
um it's it's really smart for him to
talk about the risk to to Trump because
if nothing happens to Trump then he's
sort of a good guy who you know showed
some empathy for Trump and warned him
and if something does happen to
Trump he's the guy who warned
him so warning Trump about the danger is
just a smart play like it it's good no
matter what happens it's good for Putin
it's not good for
us and uh s Putin went and he legalized
crypto in Russia and he slash taxes on
mining mining from crypto I guess I
think that's what that means
um and he uh trading income will be
taxed at 133% and blah blah blah more if
it's more so basically uh he's big on
crypto what do you think of that well
you know Trump is pro crypto compared to
any prior
president
and I've heard some people say that
crypto is the only way the US ends up
financially okay and what I mean by that
is that if you own some
crypto let's say Bitcoin specifically um
its odds of going up in value the smart
people say it's almost guaranteed now
the the counterargument would be there's
something that we find out that we
didn't know about and that's a pretty
big risk for example finding out that
there's some way to hack or steal your
crypto wallet that nobody could have
seen coming and no way to fix it now I
haven't seen that but you could sort of
imagine that something that's a
technology where there might be some
vulnerability that you haven't uh seen
yet but if that doesn't happen that
alleged hypothetical vulnerability that
nobody's quite seen yet um in all the
all of the uh all of the signals say
that crypto will just keep going up
basically
forever so if you had for example a
bunch of cash Investments and you add a
little bit of
crypto your situation should be that
your your cash will uh inflate away to
zero and your crypto will make up all
the
difference so if you had I don't know
what the percentages would be because
nobody knows what the future is but I'll
just give you numbers to like kind of
tell the story but don't get caught up
on the percentages okay so if for
example 80% of your wealth was in
cash-like things you know like stocks
and bonds and cash that could actually
go to
zero it could over time I mean not
tomorrow but it could go to zero over
time just because of inflation so not
actually zero but it but it could become
so little that you know you wish you
didn't Own It crypto could make up all
of that difference so if you had 20%
crypto and 80% regular cash you might
find that the one going up is about
matching the one going
down but I'm not smart enough or wise
enough to say that 20% crypto is a smart
number it's not what I have I have less
so I'm not giving you any advice on
crypto this is not not Financial advice
but if you're trying to figure out how
in the world does the United States
survive crippling debt that just can't
be paid back basically it can't be paid
back let's be honest we're not going to
pay back any $ 35 trillion do 36
nobody's getting paid back we're getting
inflated
away and people will wish they didn't
own it basically so it could be that the
only way out is
crypto if the government owns some as
well as all the citizens then we could
pay our taxes and Etc so then if you
take that cont context and then you look
at Putin legalizing crypto and trying to
get ahead of crypto could it be that TR
that Putin knows because he's a pretty
smart
player that uh Russia also has to have
crypto or else they're doomed or maybe
he needs to own crypto to have some kind
of Leverage over the West so when I see
Putin going hard at crypto it makes me
think that he might be thinking a few
moves ahead of us so having Trump in
office surrounded by smart people who
are pro
crypto it feels good I I'm glad that the
Trump Administration not Trump
specifically he he's no crypto expert
but he's certainly surrounded by people
who are going to advise him well on that
I
think meanwhile France has announced
that
Netanyahu uh is entitled to immunity
from the international criminal court
because they're not a party to the
court now why did it take me until today
to realize
that so the inter international criminal
court uh has a bunch of countries ass
signed up but it does not include the
United States and it does not include
Israel for I guess suppose obvious
reason
cuz they would be basically we'd be the
only ones taken to court and but but
France is saying we're not going to
arrest somebody who never signed that
treaty to which I say oh why why did it
never occur to me
that that you wouldn't arrest somebody
who wasn't part of the treaty so they
couldn't have broken
it makes sense now obviously that was
just a workaround because France doesn't
want to be enemies with
Israel but
it's it's just funny that I didn't see
that obvious play that you can't arrest
somebody who didn't sign up for
it it's worth a
shot uh Eric
Weinstein agrees with me on
physics the difference between us is
that he's uh
deeply uh let's say deeply invested and
educated and experienced in the domain
of physics and has his own uh well
educated smart thoughts about string
theory and his well educated thoughts uh
match my own thoughts for the past 20
years for at least 20 years I've been
saying you know this String Theory
thing it sure has every signal for being
 now obviously I have no Science
Background whatsoever but everything
that I kept hearing about
it every time I heard something about it
I thought you know
I don't think that even looks real just
doesn't even look real and Eric
Weinstein says that uh that string
theory has sort of been the dominant
thing people were trying to look at for
the you know The Theory of Everything to
tie everything together and then because
it was so dominant as a as a promising
direction that it blocked any real
breakthroughs for 40
years and that uh at least is a
confident or optimistic I'll say he's
optimistic that after 40 Years of not
getting the job done the physicist might
be willing to look past it now and if
they look past it suddenly the the
possibility of major major
breakthroughs might be better
now this is sort of one of those hunch
kind of ideas because you don't know
what the future looks like so you know
you know you don't know that there's
something out there that's better than
string theory and that we have access to
it and it'll make a difference we don't
know that but to me it's uh it's a warm
feeling to know that somebody who is as
deep into this topic uh as Eric is has
exactly the same opinion I did as just
somebody who can spot pretty
easily the the only thing I
claim is not that I know what is
true but I can often spot what isn't so
that's my only my only comment on string
theory is like I don't know every time I
read a story about
this it's not that I think the science
is wrong it's that everything about this
just smells wrong just just everything
about it so I agree with Eric I think
that's the way it's going to go but it's
a hunch on my part not based on any
knowledge well as you know Trump is
planning to do this largest uh
deportation ever but axios reports and I
was waiting for this to happen I I kind
of suspect that that sooner or later the
news would start telling you the
following
thing you're not going to get many
illegal
people so I and Holman and Trump and
everybody smart said the same thing they
said we're obviously going to focus all
of our resources in getting rid of the
criminals and and we don't know how long
that's going to take and there's so many
of them but it turns out if you put all
your resources on it yeah you might get
a few there just aren't many and axos
had a story here I won't go through the
details you can read it yourself in
axios but um for example there are a
whole bunch of people who are felons who
have been convicted of horrible things
like homicide and sexual assault but you
can't Deport any of them until they
finish their jail sentences
so you got 29,000 people who are the mo
the most hardened worst criminals and we
have them in custody and they're not
going to get
deported because they're already in jail
and jail is the place I guess the law
says they got to be and then there are a
few other examples like
that where there are people who are sort
of here legally
Etc um
so it's
possible that Holman won't be able to
find Big Bus loads of people to send
anywhere so maybe what you're worried
about were where you're seeing the
military round up giant groups of people
and keep them in detention centers until
the military transport could get there
and take them back it's a terrible
visual that you don't want to live in
the country where you're seeing your
military carrying anybody away like for
anything it's just a terrible look I'm
I'm Pro Deport ation for the criminals
especially uh but it's a it's a bad look
so I don't think we're going to have
that look I I think there might be like
an anecdotal here or there you know
there might be a Bus full of people or a
Detention Center that's there
temporarily but my current feeling is if
we stop the new immigrants you know the
new illegal immigrants if we stop that
pretty well and I think Trump will do
that that the gigantic migration
immigration even if we try as hard as we
can it's just hard and I think it'll be
half Buss and it just won't be that much
of a visual problem that's my guess so
my prediction is you'll see a few
anecdotal reports so there will be some
reports of too much deportation but
they'll be so limited and so just you
know temporary that it's not really
going to change the public view of
things too much that's what I
think there is also the claim that uh
immigrants do less crime than
Americans and that's offered as the
argument that you should not
Deport so does that argument work with
you that the average immigrant let let's
let's do two takes on this all right so
here what we're going to do is just work
through the thinking so we're we're only
talking about how to how to think about
it should you say hey let's have more
immigration because on average they
lower our average crime rate does that
make
sense let's lower our average by having
more immigration because apparently the
more immigrants you have the lower your
crime rate is because they have a lower
crime
rate do you buy that let's say it's true
just for a moment let's say they do have
a crime
rate there are also 29,000 felons who
are convicted of homicide or sexual
assault that's 29,000 people who would
be
alive if we didn't have illegal
immigration 29,000 people would be alive
or not
raped doesn't that feel like a lot I
mean I know it's a big country and and
the 29,000 would be over multiple years
but doesn't your government and your
citizens do not your citizens have the
right to say I don't care that they have
a better
rate I want them to kill zero
people if somebody comes into your house
and Slaughters your
family and the police say whoa turns out
that the odds of somebody coming in your
house and slaughtering your family are
way low so stop worrying about it you'll
be like but but they slaughtered my
family I know but as a percentage of all
the crime is very low but but my
family's
dead I think you need to be a little
less racist about this yes they did get
slaughtered by an you know by somebody
but as a percentage it was very unlikely
so if you could just get over
it yeah
so I think that both things can be
true um the I did look a little bit at
some of the
studies and I would say that uh there is
some good evidence that uh the recent
immigrants are lower at
crime now what they said was I know what
you're going to say don't say it I know
what one of you is going to say because
there's always at least one somebody
here is going to say Scott the american
crime rate is not like one average you
know are they are they doing more or
less crime than black Americans more or
less than white Americans more or less
than um
asian-americans well I saw one study
that said that they had they do less
crime than white
Americans do you you know they left
out as they always do
asian-americans do do you know how often
these stories just act like there's no
they're no
asian-americans all right now let's ask
the question again I'm an Asian-American
and you tell me that I'm bringing in
immigrants but don't worry they're their
crime rate is less than the white
people and as an Asian-American I say
what it's less than the white people is
it less than
asian-americans no no it's more than
asian-americans but it's less than the
white
people how do you feel about that so
you're going to increase the rate of
crime in my community yeah but it's
still less than the white
people I I'm just amused that the
asian-americans do such a good job of
staying in a jail and making money and
staying married and basically doing
everything right just
continuously and then get left out of
the
conversation because they do everything
right anyway good job asian-americans
um but here was one of the uh hypotheses
about why the immigrants are less likely
to be involved in
crime and here comes the kill shot are
you ready for
this this is not going to make you
happy I'm going to give you a reason and
now this is just one person's
speculation but it sounded so good I'm
I'm going to embrace it as my
own there is a reason that recent
immigrants are more likely or less
likely to do a
crime you're not going to like
it here's a reason that recent
immigrants are less likely to do crime
you ready for it because they're more
likely to be employed Married with
Children and in good
health oh
no
no
no
no no
no no is that
true is it true recent immigrants are
more likely to be employed Married with
Children and in good
health because those things are very
predictive that you're not going to do a
crime I think these are true you know
anecdotally anecdotally it's true every
time I think of something in my own life
who came was born in another
country they're
married they're
employed they have
children and they go to church damn
it damn it they're
Republicans let me say it the fast way
yes the reason that recent immigrants do
not commit as many crimes is because
they're Republicans they don't know the
Republicans they just act like it
get a job get married have kids go to
church
Republicans so so if I said to you
immigrants tend to be Republicans with
all that comes with it getting jobs and
getting married and staying in a jail
that's easy that's easy to accept isn't
it if I tell you that immigrants don't
have a high crime rate your first your
first reaction is W it's not the rate
I'm looking at I'm looking at 29,000
people in jail for murder and
rape but if I told
you uh we brought in a million people
who are basically
Republicans and I say whoa whoa whoa a
million people what about all the crime
and then I say yes there's definitely
crime because any group of people would
have extra crime but there essentially
the same rate of crime as
Republicans and then what do I do
what do I do
then because let's say I'm a Republican
and I like Republicans and I and I agree
that they don't do a lot of
crime anyway so as I often say if
somebody tells you the raw number of
something and doesn't tell you the
percentage they are a propagandist
that's brainwashing and they're not
trying to tell you something useful
likewise if they tell you the percentage
but not the raw number they are
propagandists they're trying to to
brainwash you they're not trying to have
an honest conversation you need to look
at both every time or you don't know
anything and I think it can be 100% true
that on average we're bringing in a
pretty high high class of people at
least in terms of cultural compatibility
with America at the same time we're
bringing in a whole bunch of criminals
they can both be true we we simply have
to do a better job of everything that
we're already doing and and I think
everybody agrees with
that
meanwhile um Tom
Holan who's going to be the head of the
Border stuff um he was challenged by I
guess a Denver Mayor Mike Johnston
because Mike Johnston said he's not
going to let um the citizens of his City
who are maybe undocumented he's not
going to let them be rounded up taken to
jail and that people like him will be
putting their bodies in the way
basically protesting in a physical way
and uh he doesn't he doesn't care if he
has to go to jail for it he's willing to
go to jail to defy Trump's deportation
operation so somebody asked Tom Holman
about the fact that the Denver mayor is
willing to go to jail to stop
deportation and Tom Holan without
cracking his smile says
and I
paraphrase well at least we found
something we agree on he's willing to go
to jail and I'm willing to put him in
jail and May I drop my
mic there mic
drop yes Tom
Holman that was kind of perfect
communication right
there yeah Tom Holman is good in general
he's a good
communicator uh but but every now and
then he'll he'll hit like a you know
just a base clearing home run that's a
base clearing home run yep we agree
you're willing to go to jail I'm willing
to put you there what's
next nicely done communication wise I'm
talking
about
um I saw a video of tulsey Gabbert and I
didn't remember she did this but when
she was talking about why she was
leaving the Democrat Party and she
mentioned there were War mongers which
didn't make sense for her and that they
were too woke but also she said directly
that they were anti-white racist the
Democrat Party I don't remember her
saying that
directly but I'd like to thank her
because that's both honest and
true so yes the Democrats are an
anti-white racist party I see them as
racists
primarily anyway So speaking of uh
verbally being verbally good there's
this representative of Van
Orton who was being challenged by a CNN
guy uh CNN host was asking about Trump's
tariffs and that Trump's tariffs would
increase food
prices so how would you answer that
because everybody's worried about the
price of eggs and whatnot so food prices
are you could argue our number one you
know really Main Street kind of a issue
and uh Trump's talking about tariffs and
tariffs would increase prices everybody
understands that and here's what rep
representative van Orton said quote I'm
willing to pay more for guacamole if it
means fenel poison doesn't come across
our
border oh
wow oh wow now that's some good
communicating now is it sort of accurate
No well no no I mean it's not it's not
guacamole to fentanyl if it were only
guacamole to fenel we would all eat
fewer
fewer avocados and we wouldn't notice
because we just eat other stuff but G
the bigger problem is at all food price
or or enough of the food goes up in
price that it hits
everybody so it's certainly not as easy
as avoiding
avocados however when representative van
Orton puts it in that term it is so
linguistically excellent in terms of an
argument so this is just a persuasion
lesson I'm not talking about the policy
just about the persuasion and the
communication so nice job so I'm gonna
this uh this raises my flag so I've
never heard of Representative van Orton
before uh but he he said a second thing
he said uh about fenel he said everyone
is now one degree of separation from
somebody who died from a fenel
death I think that's close to true that
pretty much everybody knows somebody I
mean in my case my stepson but you all
know me so every one of you who knows me
knows you're one one degree away um and
most of you know somebody else who is
one degree away now both of those
sentences are really
strong you know I of all the things you
could have said about this
topic U Van Orton reached into the
middle and picked out two of the
best that probably is not a
coincidence so what I'd ask you just
keep an eye on this
guy because this is unusually good
communication and when you see that it's
usually a a leading indicator you're
going to see more of this person so um
keep an eye on him
Rob Briner has allegedly deleted his
account on
X uh after Trump won breit bar news is
reporting this and
uh we think he's probably going over to
Blue
Sky um I think he's is that confirmed I
don't know but blue sky is the new
competitor decks uh Jack dorsy new uh
product and it's apparently the uptick
is pretty good it's getting a lot of
people but
I just want to point out something that
somebody pointed out in the comments to
me
earlier you can be on
a or you can be on Blue Sky what would
be the initials for Blue
Sky if you're going to use an acronym
Blue Sky well I would use the B I
probably use the S from sky that would
be
oh it's literally
BS all right but here's the thing I
think is
funny um if if Blue Sky had started in a
let's say an organic way where it was
just a product and everybody had a
chance to use it if they liked it they
use it some more they would probably
have a normal mix of you know left and
right political people because everybody
would have seen as just the product so
it's not political it's just a product
but because were highly politicized
especially at the moment people see blue
sky as where the good and Noble
Democrats can go and they see X as that
polluted right-wing conspiracy place so
presumably Blue Sky now has the greatest
number of people with mental health
issues of any platform
ever and I mean that seriously I would
bet you any amount of money
really that if you just looked at the
percentage of users of you know any
other platform Facebook
X anything else anything else Rumble
that you would find that blue sky
probably has just through the
roof therapy and uh you know on Mental
Health meds and every kind of anxiety
and depression and let's just say that
they wouldn't know their whole body is
also
brain have you noticed how many people
on the left who seem to have defective
brains and by defective I mean either
they're not very bright which is that's
a problem that's on the left and the
right of course there's always some
people are not bright but the ones who
seem
crazy have you noticed that their bodies
also look uh
deformed have you noticed you have
noticed haven't you yeah you look at
their bodies and then you listen to them
you go wow the things that are coming
out of their brains sound just
crazy it's not their brain their body is
their brain all right if your if your
body is destroyed as many of the people
on the left have destroyed their bodies
you're going to get just crazy stuff
coming out of your mouth and that would
be a very typical
predictable scientifically compatible
prediction that you could feel pretty
confident about that if that if you have
one group where their bodies are a mess
and one group on the right especially
young men who are very interested in
keeping their physical fitness going you
should have one group that's happy and
one group that's sad and I think because
of the weird situation of everything
being politicized that the people with
the the worst
brains not necessarily born the worst
but because their body is their brain if
they didn't take care of it it's just
not working very well and they all ended
up in blue sky
so I'd be real curious if if I'm right
that if you went to Blue Sky it would
look like a a mental illness
festival and it wouldn't have if it had
just been a non-political time when it
was
launched so we'll see but at the same
time that Rob Brer left all of my PID
trolls are gone I don't know if you were
watching the fund but for the past year
or so uh they're very obviously paid and
the way you know they're paid is that
they they show up like it's time for
work so if I would do a post that made a
any good point against Democrats or for
Trump the first comment 100% of the time
the first one would be a troll and the
way you can know they're a troll is that
they they have a maybe four or five
messages that they repeat that are not
the ones anybody else ever says it's
obvious that at some point in time
somebody made a list of all the things
you say to
Scott so you say to him oh Scott your
your opinion of politics is as good as
your taking care of your stepson who
died of
fenel that was one of them very common
oh I guess that's why you're divorced
which would have nothing to do with
politics or anything I said so um and oh
that and I guess that's why you're
cancelled so they would go for what they
thought was the most
psychologically destructive thing they
could say um completely
divorced from whatever point I tried to
make so in other words they weren't
saying oh have you checked the source
they were not saying your facts are
wrong they were not saying uh have you
considered this they were not saying
here's the fact check they were saying
what can I say that will make this guy
not want to spend another second on X
and want to you know get a high-powered
rifle and do something bad and then they
would pick that it's very obvious that
there were like five things on the list
and that it was somebody's job to sit
there and when it goes Bing they know
I've they know I've gone and they
quickly go to their list they go o Adams
five things marriage to know I'll pick
number three it was very obvious like
cuz nobody else was doing it except the
first comment of everyone that was a
political post and if I posted something
that was just you know interesting or
fun nope don't show
up so these were not political actors
and and I could tell they were not
political in 2016 I have to admit I
couldn't
tell I just thought there were terrible
people on the internet because there are
terrible people everywhere I thought
whoa some of these are more terrible
than others but one but once I
understood that um was it
from I guess that's was that the name of
the guy who organized the trolls for the
2016 cycle so we knew actually after the
fact after 2016 election we knew who
hired the
trolls we we knew the budget it was
exactly what it looked like
what I couldn't tell then is whether
some of the people were just organically
bad and some of the people were paid but
I couldn't tell which are paid and which
are organic but this last cycle the paid
ones were just so
obvious so every time they did it I
would just respond paid
Troll and how many times did you see me
do that because it was almost every day
payrol payrol and it was always the
first comment
anyway I'm glad they're gone it's really
different on X
[Music]
now
um Heather McDonald was doing some
writing recently and I forget what
publication but um talking about how men
and women generally uh differ and how
they prioritize safety and inclusion
versus accepting
conflict
um and goes to point out that there may
be a uh maybe some evolutionary reason
where men handle conflict different
differently from women and the
observation is this I've made the same
observation which is that men can uh
fight and go at each other like
crazy but if they find a reason to agree
and work together they can almost
instantly get over it like the past just
goes away and we shake hands and we
apologize and we accept apologies and we
say oh well that was an ugly moment we
had there together glad that's gone and
now we're friends or now we're allies or
co-workers whatever we need to be so the
thought was that
men uh knew that their best survival
mechanism was to not turn every enemy
into either dead or you stay an enemy
but sometimes just get them on your side
and then you have an extra person on
your side
so having an extra man on your side is
going to keep you alive so the thinking
is that we're just
evolved the men are easier to say all
right I'm over it let's let's move on
and that uh women would be less likely
to get over it and sort of keep it as a
permanent source of at least mental
conflict so in other words when men hear
a provocative
speech um they might enjoy the debate
enjoy the fight and also be able to get
over it
instantly whereas women if they go
online and they see a
debate they might also be drawn into the
debate but they're not enjoying
it and they're not getting over it so
it's a whole different whole different
approach so
um so the the point of this is that uh
there might be a male warrior hypothesis
that might be hardwired biologically
that that fits with my
observation so my observation is that
men can get over disagreements pretty
easily all
right um the LA Times
owner uh was doing an interview with X
CNN star Oliver Darcy I didn't know
Oliver Darcy got fired from CNN or did
he quit
he he was terrible on CNN but he's went
on his own now so the LA times as you
know has a some rich owner who uh didn't
want to endorse KL Harris he wanted to
try to find some Middle Ground where he
thought newspapers should be so he got a
lot of push back from that and
apparently one of the new things he's
doing is he wants to change up his LA
Times editorial board and he's hired
Scott
Jennings so Scott Jennings the you know
viral Superstar on CNN the the Trump
sporting guy who embarrasses the other
clowns at the table on a daily basis it
was selected to be part of the LA Times
editorial board
so good job Scott Jennings again another
Scott doing
well but uh apparently the billionaire
owner of the LA Times ended the call
because uh Darcy just kept um giving him
a hard time about hiring uh Scott
Jennings and uh apparently Darcy ended
up going full TDS and uh and the the
owner of the newspaper and his Handler
whoever it was was like H we're done
here B basically they just dismissed him
as not even a a serious character which
was the right thing to do now I should
tell you that the LA Times when Dilbert
was in newspapers before I got cancelled
uh the LA Times was the only one that
was cancelling Dilbert or or editing it
censoring it actually uh LA Times was
the only newspaper that routinely
censored
Dilbert back in the days when Dilbert
ran in every
newspaper the LA Times would just
sometimes just not run one and it got so
it was just like laughably predictable I
do a comic that was just a little bit
edgy but still rated G because you can't
really get past G in a newspaper is
still rated G and and the LA Times would
say oh can't say that every other
newspaper would say yes so um I I'm very
up on the this new owner um it looks
like he's trying to do a serious job of
improving the newspaper and they
certainly needed
it well I read I think it was in the
hill they had a story about the Democrat
bench for 2028
I'll tell you when you look at what what
the smart people think are their best
next um politicians for running for
president it doesn't look like they have
a chance so here are the names that are
floating as their best
candidates kamla
Harris
seriously literally the worst campaign
of all time and she's running
first uh Gavin
Nome
seriously Gavin
Nome he's like right at the top of your
list after destroying California
Gretchen
Whitmer Josh
Shapiro Pete Buddha judge and JB
priter do you think any one of those
could be a capable Republican and can
name I don't know probably 10
Republicans who could be any one of
these people am I wrong about that am I
wrong that there are at least there have
to be at least 10 prominent Republicans
that could be everyone on this list
these are not these are not
competitive I don't think Democrats have
any understanding of what would even
make their side competitive and the the
entertainment which I'm getting in
watching them not understand anything
they don't understand
anything it's really
amazing
and
uh I'm looking at some of your comments
those are
weird fedman you know what I I don't
think the Democrats would push fentam
fedman to the front of the line he may
be a little bit of a problem because he
doesn't obey the Democrats enough but if
fedin wanted to take a run at it he
would be the one I'd worry about I don't
want to give advice to the Democrats but
if I heard that fedman was running for
president in the next
cycle I would say that's a
problem yeah now AOC has been mentioned
I don't that doesn't seem serious to me
I can't imagine she would even win the
primary but
fedman fedman could really fool
everybody
because he he does have he has the
common touch and he doesn't seem to be
willing to
lie when everybody else
is and I hate to say that's a really
attractive
combination you know he is smart I mean
it was hard to tell when he had his his
stroke but he's he's an unusually smart
person and he clearly cares about the
country and clearly cares about people
and he clearly is smarter than the
average Democrat and he sees that there
are some things that Republicans see
that he says that makes sense you can
perfectly understand why the the Dem why
the Republicans would feel this way so
he's the only one who seems to
have anything close to an understanding
of what's
happening I think fedman knows exactly
what's wrong that the Democrats act like
woke
idiots the Republicans act like acted
like problem solvers and we were not in
a place where acting like a woke idiot
was a luxury we could afford it it was
once at one point it was a luxury we
could afford not
anymore now you just need the solution
to the problems so it wasn't it was
never to me it never seemed like they
were a close competition even though the
vote was closer than I thought it should
be what if RFK goes back to the Democrat
Party I don't think I don't think RFK uh
Jor has a chance in a um a race like
that I he's got he's got so many points
of
attack that I I think he's serious about
having one Mission left like he has his
One mission fix the
food and uh I have high hopes that he
will I see you got a copy of loser think
I don't know how you got it it's no
longer for a sale um it was one of my
cancelled books so you must have got a
you must have one of the used used
copies but maybe at some point I'll
reissue
that
um Democrats do not allow an independent
thinker yeah true that
all right so I'll tell you again if you
don't have your Dilbert calendar ordered
just go to dilbert.com and that's the
only place you'll find the link to order
it you will not find that link anywhere
else it's not on Amazon it's not on
bookstores not in
Walmart uh but the books are my books
make excellent gifts they change lives
yeah the the the first two reframe your
brain and had to failed almost
everything those are total life Chang
ders I I hear it every day and I
guarantee it by the way um if I weren't
hearing it every single day I wouldn't
say that but every day I hear people say
oh changed my whole
life so it's a good gift if you want to
change somebody's
life hey you got a lot of calendars
there if a well AOC is married and if
she had children would she be a better
politician
um
maybe uh loop
speak the the media will pump up the
chosen yeah but I don't know if the I
don't know if the media has the ability
to drag a bad candidate over the Finish
Line anymore they did with Biden but it
looked like they couldn't with Harris
maybe she was just extra bad but it does
seem that the rise of the podcasters is
a real thing it's going to last for a
while all
right ladies and
gentlemen um that's all I got for today
um I'm going to talk to the locals
people privately in a
moment and uh I'll see the rest of you
tomorrow thanks for joining on YouTube
and
