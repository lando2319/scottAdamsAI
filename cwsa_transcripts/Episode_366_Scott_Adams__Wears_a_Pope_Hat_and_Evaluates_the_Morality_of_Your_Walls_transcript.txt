bless you come in
children I'm here to make some
judgments on the morality of your
walls now until recently many of you did
not know that walls could have a moral
Dimension oh
how little you know how much I will
teach
you you've come to learn and I
appreciate that about you bless you you
blur now I'm going to show you a variety
of walls and I'd like to teach you how
to recognize an immoral wall from a
moral wall so we'll we'll start with the
bad news
first uh I'm going to show you a picture
of
what I think is an an immoral
wall so this is from Google images and
as you can see there's a
demon the demon is actually visible if
you have been praying some of you
perhaps you can't even see it but
there's a there's a demon actually in
the wall that's an immoral wall That's
not the wall you want let's look look at
some
others here's a wall obviously another
bad wall um this this nice lady is
yelling at the wall you don't you don't
yell at a moral wall do you you do not
so that's an immoral wall right
there let's see some
more oh yeah there's more oh no
this this is one of the worst
this one
actually shows a demon completely
outside the
wall and probably ready to attack the
citizens of this defenseless country
with I don't know it could
be Twitter
insults possibly nicknames the worst of
the Demons can go pretty
deep let's check another wall
try to find one that's more
moral okay here's here's a wall that's
pink and um I think you know pink is
just automatically moral because if
you've ever been
robbed or
beaten or had any kind of a horrible
crime committed against you was the
perpetrator wearing
pink was there any pink
involved when you were being accosted
and a crime was being committed against
you no no it was not so when you see a
pink wall that's a moral wall nothing
bad is going to happen around that that
wall
there now well here's here's one okay
here's a wall made entirely of
donuts now
again that's a good wall right that's a
wall you can you can take your children
to this wall but don't let them eat the
wall it's a this is a wholesome wall if
you don't mind dying of
diabetes um some more walls let's
see uh gosh these are just horrible
horrible walls they're oh here we
go here's here's an whole Army whoops
here's a whole Army of evil
walls it appears that they're massing at
the border each of these walls
individually is plenty evil but when
they get together like this and they
start hunting as a pack well then you
got some real real trouble oh but it
looks like there could
be possibly an angel that got in here I
don't know if you can see it but one of
those walls is not like the
other you know it looks like a wall with
a butt do you see the wall that has a
large
buttox well you're disgusting if that's
what you say because that's actually the
shape of a church pew so that one that
one is not a demon that's an
impostor so let me show you the best way
to have a moral wall
and we're going to go to the Whiteboard
for
this for this
tutorial um here we have a holy
wall you can see that there's a wall and
then a little bit of wall and then
you've got some more wall over here but
here's the key point and if you don't if
you don't have this in your wall you've
got an evil wall you've got a wall
that's just stopping people from getting
to the other side that's like totally
evil so instead you want a a hole every
now and then you don't want people to
have to walk along ways you know one of
the ways you could get this wrong is if
this hole and this hole were like miles
apart people would have to walk for
miles to get through the hole well
that's not very moral is it is that nice
is that nice when people come to your
house do you say oh come on in the house
oh no not through the front door climb
up on the roof and crawl down my chimney
well that wouldn't be very moral so you
don't want your your holes in your wall
to be too far away and here's another
wall see I've I've labeled it for you so
this is a holy
wall and that's
very extremely
moral now people have asked me some
specific
questions about wall morality which
oddly enough is my exact
expertise um you know I I don't know
much about
Electronics couldn't tell you what star
system is up there but I can tell you
the morality of a wall like nobody's
business you don't get this hat without
being able to do that unless you just
order it from Amazon like I did
now some people ask
me Scott where's the holy water to which
I say right here
and I invite you now to join me in the
sacrament that I call coffee but you
might call coffee or tea or some other
beverage and you will join me now for
the simultaneous popat
[Music]
sip now one of the question questions
that people ask me
is since Nancy Pelosi was the one who
started asking about whether walls are
moral or immoral and in what condition
are they moral and of course it's a
delicate balance because she's in favor
of Steel like barriers that prevent
people from crossing the border
easily but apparently those are the
moral kind of
laws the immoral kind of walls
that President Trump has suggested she
has poo pooed she is poo pooed did I say
and so people say is she a hypocrite
Pope Scott because she has a wall around
her own home in San
Francisco an actual
wall is her wall immoral or
moral well I have a ruling for
you in order to answer that question I
stopped by her home I couldn't get
inside but you know obviously there was
a wall there so I couldn't get that
close but I only came to see the wall
and I was just judging the wall I you
know wasn't going to judge her interior
decorating I was there for the wall so
it was okay I was on the
sidewalk and I've been traveling for a
few hours to get there to the
city and I hadn't used the restroom and
well here's the thing a lot of people
don't know
this but holy water has more than
one let's say
type anything that I put into my body
especially coffee is holy
water but what you don't realize is that
after it passes through my
body still holy water if it goes in as
holy water and it goes through my Pope
body well it's not getting less holy is
it goes in holy comes out holy well let
me just skip to the end of the story so
Nancy P's wall uh has been blessed with
holy
water
and that should tell you it's as holy as
it could possibly
get not really I wouldn't drive all the
way to San
Francisco but it's a funny story and I
made you imagine it
was it immoral of me to make you imagine
that I was blessing her wall with holy
water a little bit maybe a little
bit but Nancy Pelosi's wall I approve of
it is blessed it is now
holy
and if you have any other walls that you
would like me to
evaluate I believe I could do
that um the the general
General ranking is a good solid wall
that people can't get over around
totally
immoral a good solid
fence the type that we have for much of
the Border already and Democrats and
Republicans have both approved multiple
times Well people can kind of get over
those if they need to so I'm going to
say that those are half
holy those are are slightly
immoral and then there complete Open
Spaces with no fence and no wall and the
only thing stopping you from coming to
the country is being uh killed on the
way totally
moral as long as people are dying in the
desert from their own decision and it
wasn't the wall that killed them but
rather it was them going around the wall
I suppose still okay so on the Nancy
Pelosi scale of wall morality the most
immoral laws are the ones that stop
people and keep them safe the walls that
are really immoral are the ones that
don't work and invite people to come and
risk their lives and their health to get
here
all right I think I've said it all I
will be watching with you tonight when
the president does his
address I've never been so excited about
a presidential
anything until this until this President
turned the entire entire country into a
reality TV show and we're all actors in
it so this is a whole different
experience I cannot wait to watch how
all the apparently the news networks
have
decided that they're going to treat the
president like a big liar and then try
to and try to not report it as news and
I think they're walking into a little
trap
there
because because it sort of opens the
question what is fake news and uh for
that and many other reasons I'll be
watching tonight and uh I'll be thinking
of you bless you
