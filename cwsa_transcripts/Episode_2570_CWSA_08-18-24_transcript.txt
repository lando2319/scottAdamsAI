e e
well well well we may or may not be live
let's see
I had to restart the rumble studio so
looks like we have people well look at
that
huh by the way if you're not if you're
not subscribing to the Dilbert reborn
comic strip that's what that is over my
right hand corner and you're missing
such a good show because the comic is
really spicy
now so uh how would you like to do some
kind of a show
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take it up a nacho to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need is a copper muger glass a
tankered chalous or aen juger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine end of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and today it's coming
with a little extra oxytocin
go I feel like a wine taster you know
where they where they do the things it's
like H I believe there's a note of Elder
Berry a little bit of
chalk and a little bit of soil from the
West Bank of the Ohio
River but when I do the coffee it's like
little dopamine
serotonin I think there's a little note
of oxytocin in
there let's talk about all the things
there's a study so it must be true that
watching 5 hours a day of TV can
increase your risk of Dementia by nearly
50% according to a study reported in the
Daily
Mail huh what do you think I'm going to
say about that
study backwards science backwards
science yes it is entirely possible that
watching TV rots your brain it is
slightly more likely that the people who
are not inclined to exercise
watch TV
more could it be that the people who
don't have much going on are not very
not very
motivated don't do all the things that
you do to keep yourself
healthy like leave the house and go
outdoors and exercise and that sort of
thing or do they sit in front of the TV
and eat FR Loops I don't know but it
seems to me that maybe the correlation
is that if you're not inclined to
exercise which of course is very highly
correlated with dementia you might fill
that time with watching TV I don't know
that it's the TV giving you the dementia
I think it's the doing everything that
gives you dementia is compatible with
watching a lot of
TV so just be careful with that
one uh all I know is that MSNBC viewers
are the hardest
hit so whatever that means I'm making
that up I'm making that up but I'm
pretty sure that MSNBC Watchers have the
most mental health
problems how much would you bet on
that if there were a betting market and
you could find out for sure and somebody
says all right you're going to have to
place a bet we're going to compare the
viewers of Fox News with MSNBC viewers
and you have to guess which viewers have
the highest level of documented mental
health
issues would anybody bet that it was the
Fox News viewers
I'll bet
nobody I'll bet literally nobody would
bet that the Fox News viewers have
higher mental health problems
nope nope it's exactly what it looks
like well here's the most important
story there was a Russian tourist in
Thailand who apparently tried to have
sex with a
cow uh the cow did not appreciate it and
uh pinned down the completely naked
Russian man and uh started to gore him
with his with his uh
horns now you might say to me
Scott why are you even telling us this
story about the Russian man in Thailand
trying to have a sex with a
cow well there are a few things that
jump out on me number one I've never
been to Thailand but what I hear from
people who have been to Thailand is you
don't have to settle for a cow
I'm not going to say more about that
but I don't think you need to settle for
a
cow got other options it's
Thailand but uh why was it that the cow
rejected the advances of the Russian
tourist well I only have one to one
thing to say about that I believe the
cow was not in the
[Music]
mood next story
there's a Swiss firm that uh now has an
AI you can rent time on it's made of
human brain cells that's right somebody
made a bio computer that you can uh rent
time on and why would you do that well
the claim is it's up to a 100,000 times
more efficient than traditional AI
models 100,000 times more efficient than
a silicon based computer
h and they train their little uh brain
organella
thing um using dopamine and electrical
signals for
reinforcement well that that's exactly
how I trade my brain I'm like a computer
now that's right I do things to get more
dopamine I'm just like a computer that's
100 time 100 thousand times more
efficient than a traditional AI model I
think when they say efficient they mean
electricity wise I'm not sure about that
um but anyway these little
organoids these human brain cells that
they turned into a computer they could
live up to a 100
days
huh um here's my question if you put
together a bunch of human brain cells
and then train them with
dopamine does it have
Consciousness can you create
Consciousness by putting brain cells
together and then training them to act
in a way that's
organized how about free
will will the computer have free
will I'm just teasing you now free will
isn't real but a lot of you think it
is yeah now free will isn't a real thing
it's completely
imaginary what we have is the
imagination of Free Will that's real we
definitely imagine
it all
right um here's some good news or you
might interpret it as really really bad
news so this will be what are you an
optimist or a pessimist so you decide if
this is wow this is good news or is it
really really bad okay there's a county
in the United States that is the first
ever County to have a decrease in
childhood autism
rates yes all right so there's one
County it turns out it's a wealthy
County north of me Marin
County and back in the year 2000 they
started to do something that uh looks
like it actually worked and it decreased
the rate of autism that's all good news
isn't
it aren't you happy about the good news
there there's a county that figured out
how to reduce the rate of autism in
their in their County well how good is
that I mean that's great
till you find out how they did
it they reduced their schedule of
childhood
vaccinations
so that would be really really really
bad
news isn't
it is it really good news that they
figured out what the problem is maybe
remember this is not a scientific study
that this is observation
anecdotal and I remind you all data is
fake all data is fake is this data
fake could be could be so I know I
wouldn't trust the
data but it's a really big red
flag I would definitely look more into
this so I don't know the details of what
they did but they apparently just simply
didn't go along with the recommended
vaccination
schedules and reportedly now years later
they have uh a big difference in autism
rates compared to the rest of the
country is that
real I don't know I don't know I'm not
going to say it's
real I'm just going to say I'd look into
that a little bit
deeper you know when when you look at
the uh uh all the information we have
about the food
Supply killing us all the information we
have now
about maybe at least there's some
anecdotal information that the
vaccination schedules may not be as safe
as you thought what do you think of the
RFK junor race for presidency
now how do you feel about it
now you know honest honestly if I
thought he had an honest shot at
winning I don't know know he he seems to
be the only person who RFK Jr is the
only person who identified what I
consider the biggest problem in the
country that our
environment by its design for whatever
reason is killing
us and making it hard to just even enjoy
just a regular day of
life now RFK Jr I think is 100% right
about everything he says on this domain
now when I say that I'm not agree with
every thing that people say he
said that's different I'm saying what he
currently says looks completely right
what he may have said in the past or
what people say he said in the past I'm
not supporting any of that I'm only
saying his current presidential run he's
saying we need to test
better yes that's different from saying
it's definitely going to kill you and
we've proven it blah blah blah I'm not
saying that I'm saying yeah I'd like to
know more about this
and that their food supply is is killing
us I think is obvious at this point so I
haven't seen Trump or KL Harris even
mentioned that stuff Trump's eating junk
food and
kl's maybe drinking I don't know we'll
talk about that in a minute um but I
don't know how you can keep ignoring
what apparently is the biggest problem
in the country in my opinion so we'll
see where that goes
anyway um the Morton Salt
Company is going to move their operation
out of Illinois because Illinois is so
bad for business they
say
um and uh apparently they're going to
move into an operation that uh also
makes uh lithium batteries so it's going
to be a combination of factory it's
going to make uh more than Salt but also
lithium batteries
it's a case of uh salt and
Battery salt and Battery no I just made
that up they have nothing to do with a
lithium battery company but if they did
wouldn't it be funny that there would be
salt and batteries
yeah um I think I need some more
condom not condom condiment related dad
jokes do you have time for one more
condiment related dad
joke you know why the Morton Salt
Company had to leave Illinois
cuz they were being peppered with
regulations and they couldn't catch
up all right I'm sorry it's Sunday give
me a little bit of break give me a break
it's the best I could
do all right um the all-in Pod was
talking about the change in Starbucks
recently they changed their
CEO and uh I was listening to jamath on
the Allin pod say that uh Starbucks has
a bigger long-term problem he says
Starbucks is a sugar
company thank
you see this is why you should watch the
Allin pod and maybe it's the reason that
they say they're the number one podcast
in the country is this you know not this
specifically but it's for people who
have the ability to see things a little
bit more clearly than the rest of us I
mean frankly they're just smarter than
average people which is really the the
beauty of it is they're smarter and more
experienced than average people you just
put them together and they can do stuff
that average people can't do just
smarter this is exactly
right why do I agree with
it because I said it too anything that
agrees with me sounds extra smart here's
what I say about Starbucks it's a liquid
candy store have anybody have you heard
me say that so I got to Starbucks every
day and I'm a big fan so let me be clear
big fan of Starbucks and the one I go to
specifically is just tremendous great
employees service everything's good um
but there are only a few things that I
can tolerate because I don't want to put
massive sugar into my body so I have
black
coffee that feels safe enough and I have
the uh I'm not even going to tell you
because I know what happens when I if I
tell you what I eat then you'll say no
that's poison too so then I can't eat it
and then I go starved to death so let's
just say it's a challenge to find the
few things that are not packed with
sugar and what I think is that Starbucks
isn't just a liquid um Candy
store but they've disguised the liquid
candy store so that women in particular
can go in and get liquid candy and it
looks like they're getting a beverage
from
Starbucks like you don't you don't
really think of it as candy because it
came from a coffee place so you think oh
some maybe coffee drink well actually
this one doesn't have any coffee in it
well it's some kind of healthy drink
well maybe it's just a bunch of
sugar so yes Starbucks is a liquid candy
store and I don't know how that works in
the long
run I wouldn't buy stock in the company
even though I think it's amazing
company all right uh
the uh X platform and Elon Musk says he
had to close down the local Brazil
operation of X because Brazil was
threatening them and trying to force
them to censor stuff and X said no way
so they closed their local operation in
Brazil now what I don't understand from
the story because it wasn't in the few
bits I read about it is does that mean
that people in Brazil don't get to use x
or does it only mean that the local
operation shut down so there's no
physical presence of X but if you want
to get the app nothing would stop you
from doing it so I'll need
a I'll need a yes no on that I don't do
you need a VPN would you suddenly need a
VPN if you were in Brazil and you wanted
to use x I don't know exactly the
details of that but it's bad enough that
X had to close down their physical
operation in Brazil
but how and I guess I guess they could
have stayed open if they'd made a secret
agreement to keep um sensoring which
apparently the other social networks
must have
done if there's any other social network
that's operating in Brazil it means they
made a secret agreement to to censor
their
content I tell you X is the only thing
that looks credible in 2024 nothing else
looks like it's trying honestly
well as you know China was having a
population problem uh meaning they're
losing population but uh they're they're
losing it at a accelerating rate so the
population decline is not just
declining it's accelerating and its rate
of
declining and uh I saw one
characterization that China would lose
in population the equivalent of an
entire small European country every year
holy I don't know how small that
European country is some of them are
kind of small but that's that's a
lot well what about this low birth rate
Peter teal was on uh Joe Rogan's show
and one of the reasons he gave he may
have given more reasons but this is my
starter part um he said that when people
see other people having kids they're
more likely to do it themselves now that
is perfectly compatibly
accurate scientific psychological social
observation and a good one if
everybody's doing it the odds of you
doing it are way higher than if you had
to be the one person doing it that you
knew by far yeah there's there's
definitely a social contagion to really
everything and this would be no
exception but does that
capture the big reason why people are
not having enough
babies well here's my take I think the
reason that modern humans are not having
children at replacement level in a lot
of the um industrialized countries is
everything the the reason it's hard to
identify what it is that's stopping
people from having kids is because it's
everything it's everything let me just
give you a starter list you could add to
this list U just a starter is
finances right that's top of the list
you know money is very predictive if you
got paid a million dollars for having a
baby oh you'd have a baby right if you
don't have a baby and you weren't
planning to but the government said
we'll give you a million
dollars and then and then we'll also pay
for all the expenses of the child so you
just get to keep the million well
everybody would have babies of course so
money is the most predictive by far
right you it um who was it who said this
the other day it was a good reframe that
when everything was rural babies were a
financial asset to work on the farm it
was like a free employee or a lowcost
employee uh but when people moved to the
city children became an
expense so if you have more City living
you should have fewer kids because
people are just to say no thanks that's
just an
expense but it's not just finances it's
social media and the effect of social
media it's the effect of your
smartphones and the fact that we all
look less attractive to each other
because we're on our phones and we're
not paying attention to each other and
by the way let me say this as clearly as
I can you take a beautiful
woman and you just have her sitting in
front of me I'm going to say wow that's
a beautiful woman there I'm I might want
to know that beautiful woman a little
bit better all you have to do is hand
her a phone and she's instantly
unattractive to me me if she's on it
does anybody have that same feeling
there's no such thing as an attractive
woman on a
phone I I've never said that before have
you ever seen has anybody ever said it
there's no such thing as an attractive
woman on a
phone because if she's on a phone and
you're next to her she's picked the
phone over
you who's attractive who picks the phone
over you nobody now am I saying that you
know I I have good phone etiquette and I
don't do that no no no I'm not I'm not
putting myself above anybody
here I want you to hear this part
clearly I am not judging because I'm I
do it too the smartphone is the problem
not the people I'm not I'm not saying in
this example the uh the hypothetical
attractive woman is
broken I'm just saying that she has a
smartphone like everybody else so we're
we're just way less attractive to each
other um what about divorce laws divorce
laws make marriage a little bit crazy I
mean I actually saw a a woman who is a
professional uh let's say relationship
expert on social media who says
unequivocably that marriage doesn't make
sense for men
anymore if it ever did isn't that that
that is is incredible it's an expert on
relationships who says unambiguously
marriage doesn't make sense for men
anymore well how about that is the
reason people are having fewer
kids how how about uh porn being a uh
you know competitor how about our food
is poison and making us fat and
unhealthy and when you're fat and
unhealthy and unattractive you want to
get together less how about uh massive
mental Health
crisis in the country I used to look at
things these this thing called women and
I said to myself
huh I I'm a little bit attracted to that
woman do you know what I say now
probably has mental health
problems might be a Democrat that's
right might be a Democrat totally
eliminated from the possibility not not
if if they're don't care about politics
if if it's a Democrat who doesn't follow
politics that's different but we know
that we're so divided that the Democrats
will not tolerate a Republican and vice
versa so half of the people just just
were disappeared from the possibility of
reproduction with each other by politics
who did that Democrats mostly mostly
Democrats
um how about equal rights now I'm not
opposed to equal rights in case it
sounded like that I'm just saying that
if women have
jobs then they have other things to give
them satisfaction other you know
perfectly acceptable paths for life if
you didn't have the other path you're
more likely to do the baby making thing
again I'm not saying it should reverse
I'm just saying that the reason that
we're having fewer kids are just so many
it's just everything how about uh how
about social expectations how about the
need to establish a career
early how about the fear of climate
change no point having a kid if they're
just going to be fried up in the
environment how about the national debt
crisis that doesn't look
survivable I hope it is but I don't know
how and I could go on but I'm getting
this dovet Tales perfectly into my next
story which is the Democrat National
Committee will be in uh Chicago starting
tomorrow and according to the Daily
Caller there will be a Mobile Medical
unit
that will give free vasectomies and
abortions to attendees at the Democrat
National
Convention now any other
questions when I tell you that the
reason we're not having as many babies
is everything it's it's
everything it's all the way down to this
little stupid mobile van telling people
that attend the Democrat National
Congress that they should be butting up
their penis and maybe closing their woo
woo and uh maybe don't have so many
babies it's
everything you you can't find anything
that's Pro baby everything is anti-ab
right
now is is it caused in some way by one
big thing I don't know it doesn't look
like it it looks like it's the the The
Logical outcome
of a thousand things that are anti-ab
happening at the same
time so that's my
take we're expecting uh at least the New
York Post says we're expecting a 100,000
anti-israel
protesters uh at the DNC in Chicago now
is that the way you would call it we
would you call them anti-israel
protesters does that exactly
I'm not I'm not sure that that doesn't
feel exactly on point to
me that feels a little uh propaganda
is here's what I would if you were if
you were going to try to refer to the
protesters in the least propaganda way
what would you do how how would you
express
that I think I'd say they're opposed to
US policy about the Middle
East right
they're opposed to US
policy now you could also say but Scott
you're being naive you know the real
thing is they don't like uh Israel or
they're anti-semitic yeah maybe there
are people maybe there are a lot of them
in that group that are
anti-semitic that could be exactly what
explains some number of them but I would
think the one unifying message is that
they don't like us
policy toward Israel and
Etc I don't know so if you're if you're
alert for propaganda from the other side
let's say you're a republican you're
looking at the Democrat propaganda
machine don't be blind to the fact that
it's happening in both
directions I wouldn't call them so
much uh anti-israel as I would call them
anti- American policy about Israel
does that sound biased if I say it that
way am I sounding biased so let me tell
you my
bias uh I love the Jewish people Israel
is a great you know strong Ally of the
United States I like that but I'm not
pro-
Israel uh I don't support Israel as a
for anything because they don't support
me if it were reciprocal then I'd
probably be all in but um and I've said
this before I just Bears repeating
because if you talk about Israel you
should probably just say where you stand
so what you say about it makes sense
within the context of your general
opinion because if you don't say who you
are what you say doesn't make as much
sense so I'm explaining who I am so that
when I talk about it it makes sense uh
in my opinion the ADL came after me the
ADL is an an American entity Israel does
not control them but they could disavow
them that's what I ask so if Israel
disavows the ADL I would say wow Israel
you're on my team and then I would be on
their team but as it is I don't support
Israel I just observe I observe and
report all right uh there's a Texas
Middle School according to New York Post
that bans all black clothing on the kids
because it's associated with depression
what do you say do you think you should
do you think do you think it makes sense
for this school to ban one type of
clothing just because of the
color the answer is this is brilliant
this might be the smartest
school in in
Texas yes yes if you don't understand
that visual imagery and uh you know
color and sound and all these things are
programming people not just children but
that all of these things program
people uh you shouldn't be teaching any
kids you have if you don't understand
that if all the kids start wearing black
to school that that's going to change
how they think and act you should not be
involved in a school so here's somebody
who did something pretty bold actually
because it you know broke the mold of
what people are doing and just said no
the black clothing you can't do it
anymore
I'm totally I'm totally on board with
that totally on board yeah I mean there
there are lots of other uh clothing
requirements for children right they
they you know the girls can't show too
much skin that makes sense everybody's
okay with that right he probably they
I'm guessing they don't allow sagging
you know wearing your pants below your
butt probably so this is no different
than that and I think that this is wise
and it's uh I think they're the smartest
school in Texas I mean that that would
be the signal I'm getting from
them meanwhile on the betting markets I
think that's what poly Market is um it's
a
tie KL Harrison trumer a dead tie at the
moment for I think uh Harris was
slightly head for a little while but
it's a tie now here's a question I ask
you how did every American voter know
that no matter who Trump was running
against it would be a tie close to
election day how do we all know
that what's up with
that I've been saying it since forever
you know the people on the news have
been saying it forever uh you knew
it why do we all know that and and what
are the
odds does this happen in other countries
is it just natural that if you have two
parties that they tend to be a
tie they have completely different you
know approaches to things what are the
odds that the country itself is like
right down the
middle none of this sounds it doesn't
sound natural does it I don't know what
I'm looking at so I don't have a
hypothesis for why this
happens could it be some natural
inclination toward
balance could it be that Americans like
you know the president to be in one
party and the Congress to be in the
other so that you know things things
aren't too wild either direction is it
part of
that so I don't know I I don't know what
dynamic causes this but we all knew it
would be true how did we know
that just pattern
recognition I'm I'm actually genuinely
curious about this I it it's kind of a
weird
mystery but
um here's what I think I think if Harris
wins Republicans are going to think the
election was
rigged and Republicans will have a hard
time certifying it because they're going
to be convinced Beyond any doubt that it
was rigged even if it isn't they would
be convinced of it is would you agree
with that would you
agree that if Harris
wins it's going to look suspicious to
Republicans and nobody in charge is
going to be able to say yeah that's
fine so the Republicans I don't think
would be able to certify a win by
Harris what happens um what happens if
Trump wins well the Democrats Jamie
Raskin especially has already signaled
that they're going to try to uh hold
Trump um
ineligible because they'll say he's an
insurrectionist so they would use some
kind of legal Court action to make him
not
certifiable so we we're on a path that
neither candidate could win and also be
certified because nobody on the other
side is going to think the win is real
which no matter which way it
goes so what do you
do so I'm going to I'm going to Triple
down on my prediction people keep asking
me who's going to win and my answer is
neither the answer to who's going to win
the election is
neither now what happens after that when
when the neither
happens well I don't
know you know maybe uh maybe the house
picks
somebody but do you think if the house
picked uh Trump because I think there's
some number of State advantage or
something do you think the the Democrats
are going to say oh well okay that's our
process yeah the Constitution says if we
can't decide it just bumps over to the
house the house decided we're good with
that let's go on welcome president Trump
good to see you
again
nope
nope
so I don't know what's going to happen I
don't I don't predict you know the end
of America or anything like that I don't
predict Civil War I think it's just
going to be messy and it could take
months to sort it out and when we get a
president whoever is they won't be
credible meaning the O half of the
country will say you are not my
president no matter who it is that's
just where we
are all right you you remember my
prediction when KL Harris first started
talking about her economic ideas
especially the price controls and I said
to you that there are no economists who
will say this is a good idea what we're
used to is people on the left say
everything you do is great lefties and
the people on the right say everything
you do is great righties but I said this
would be the first time you've ever seen
an
exception because the price control idea
is so bad that there would be no working
Economist who would be anything but
embarrassed if they tried to support it
so sure enough now I did go further and
I said MSNBC would never have an
economist I haven't seen one yet but see
an ended CNN brought on one of Obama's
ex economists and uh one of Obama's ex
economists ripped Harris's plans to
shreds with no uncertainty it wasn't
like well might work might no just
terrible terrible destroy the whole
country kind of idea that's Obama's
Economist you know he's got more than
one uh The Washington Post the most
biased in the bag entity for Democrats
basically said no this is a bad idea
unambiguously bad
idea and then my favorite thing is that
people are saying that uh the public
needs to know that K Harris's father was
literally a Marxist
Economist a Marxist Economist so he was
an economist and a Marxist and I think
he taught at
Berkeley so he's very very smart in
addition to being a Marxist and
Economist do you know what's wrong with
this
story what's wrong with this
story there's no such thing as a Marxist
Economist you can't be both do you know
why you can't be both because if you're
really an economist you wouldn't be a
Marxist if you were really a Marxist you
couldn't agree with anything an
economist ever said no there's no
 such thing as a Marxist
economist stop gaslighting me with
Marxist economists there's no
thing called a Marxist
Economist because there's no Economist
who would say any of that's a good
idea the the only way you could have a
Marxist Economist is somebody said I'm a
Marxist and I have to admit every one of
my ideas is terrible would destroy the
country well that would be a Marxist
Economist but I don't think that person
exists no there's no Marxist economists
if it's the first time you've ever heard
this and you're saying wait a minute
that kind of makes sense how could you
be a Marxist and an economist there are
no Marxist economists none there can't
be it's logically
impossible you'll never be one all
right um but I saw some U somebody
complaining about how all the fact
Checkers are really fake yes the fact
Checkers are mostly fake but this is the
first time there might be an
exception because the professional
economists are factchecking Harris and
they're doing it
honestly I think this is the
first and it probably had to be
economists because economists can't
really say things that are obviously not
economically sound so they kind of had
to
support their own profession and their
own careers and not be stupid so they
fact checked
it but you know what I say although the
news is fake and we all know that now
right you would agree with me the news
is fake kind of an obvious obvious
observation um oh Jimmy ellot Jenny
you're back and drunk drunk Jenny is
back all caps
um so the news is fake but the news is
not as fake as the fact
Checkers and the fact cheers are not as
fake as the underlying
data just keep that in mind the news is
fake but not as fake as the ones who
fact check the
news who are not as fake as the actual
data that we're all looking at it's all
fake it's all it's all fake all the way
down until you get that everything looks
confusing until you understand
that all right so Trump um according to
the George account on X continues to be
one of my favorites in the independent
uh news related people I recommend it
highly um Trump's uh Tik Tok live stream
he did from wils wils Berry if I'm
pronouncing it correctly Pennsylvania he
did a rally
and apparently the live stream on Tik
Tok was just huge so the you don't need
to hear the numbers but it was like
amazingly huge and then when he did some
uh clips from it he posted those also on
Tik Tok and there get like 36 million
views a large majority between the you
know the younger voting ages so as
George points
out um it's the first time Trump has
directly reached young people without
the mainstream media
bias I think that might be true because
young people aren't so much looking at
act and you know if they're mostly on
Tik Tok and
Snapchat um they're not really ever
seeing Trump except filtered through
somebody else's opinion so this might
actually be the first time that Trump
has had Direct contact with young
Democrat voters
and the indication is there might be
some appreciation of him
maybe um Trump said there's never been a
more dangerous time he said this at the
rally never been a more dangerous time
for a Jews in America since the
Holocaust true or
false there's never been a more
dangerous time for Jews in America since
the
Holocaust now my common sense wants to
fight that and say that's hyperbole
that's clearly not true because I'm
thinking that it must have been more
discrimination against Jews in the you
know
50s than there is now but what's
different is we might be approaching
some kind of weird Tipping Point so if
you were to compare literally today to
the 1950s probably the 50s were more
dangerous I think but if you compare
where the 50s were heading they headed
toward you know less danger I think but
where are we heading
now maybe toward
more because the you know the 100,000
people who show up to protest the DNC
that's a lot of people I don't remember
in the 50s 100,000 people uh marching
against Jewish
Americans so you know Trump uses a lot
of Hyperbole and you got to you got to
you know at least have your eyes eyes
open to that but he might be actually
literally
right because you don't know what
happens next you know if nothing worse
happened then I would you know take
issue with whether it's the worst since
the Holocaust because it was pretty bad
before but if it's a turning point and
it's frighteningly looking like
it that's a fair statement it might be
the most dangerous time and that's
pretty scary
James Carville continues to be funny and
weirdly brilliant he says that the
election is uh shaping up to be Classy
versus
trashy Classy versus trashy so classy
would be the Democrats in Kam Harris and
walls and trashy would be you know
hillbilly JD Vance and Trump with his
personal insults and stuff like that
every time I every time I mention
Carville somebody the locals platform
puts in a meme showing Carville compared
to
Gollum it never doesn't make me laugh
anyway I'm going to side with carille on
this not not that I'm calling uh Trump
trashy but I'm going to side with him
this way
um I think that uh as we've many times
noted the Democrat Party is dominated by
U youngish women
and a lot of them
single now youngish women in my biased
opinion um are often very concerned with
accessories you're really going to hate
this
accessories for example if a young woman
falls in love with a man who's like
really got it going like they're
compatible on every level except the man
drives an embarassing
automobile how is it going to work out
it's not because the automobile is
necessary meaning that you know it's
your boyfriend's car it's not your car
but you might have to be in it somebody
might see you getting out of it and so
being associated with something
trashy such as your boyfriend's terrible
car does make a difference it's
literally matters if if you associate
unpleasant things with women they'll say
I would like less of that and I'd like
more of the things that are visually
Pleasant and associated with me because
I don't want to be associated with
unpleasant things so the accessory
effect I think is stronger with women
does that make sense from an
evolutionary biological perspective yes
because
women as men do as well try to look like
they're Worthy mating with and for women
looking attractive in all the ways you
can look attractive would be part of
attracting a mate so it does make sense
that women would be biased toward
associating with things that are classy
and not associating with anything that
anybody else would call
trashy makes sense but what about
men I think men have a different
biological evolutionary balance men
don't mind winning
ugly men don't mind winning ugly because
you know what we value winning it's the
winning yeah if I have to win ugly I'll
win ugly I'm not going to lose what you
think I'm going to lose so I can look
classy no if I have to be trashy to win
give me the
trash because winning is what I'm
designed to do I'm designed to you know
Kill The
Intruders you know to to fight off the
people trying to you know destroy my
town and winning is all that matters
like if somebody's trying to kill me and
my family and I can take him out in some
inelegant trashy way oh yeah I'm all
over it wouldn't even think twice so I
think that men look at Trump and they
say yeah he's full of things that I
wouldn't associate with personally but
can he
win yes yes he can win he can win
against other countries he can win in a
variety of
ways um KL Harris I look at and I say is
she a better thing to associate with
well in some ways I'd say yes I I
believe my social life would improve if
I said I supported Kell
Harris I think it would I mean it to
have all new friends because most of
them are on the right right now but but
overall I wouldn't feel guilty or
embarrassed by it but I don't think she
can win now she might win the election
but I don't think she can win for the
country so if you give me a choice of a
very respectable looking
Democrat who doesn't look like they can
win for the country you know against
other countries let's say in our normal
collegial compan
petition uh I I'm not interested in any
of that good look yeah that looks great
I would look great if I were attached to
that I don't care get me ugly I mean
you've watched me get cancelled
right when I got cancelled do you think
I was aware I was taking a risk of
course of course anybody would be did I
know it was ugly did I know that other
people would be disgusted by it of
course I did
did did I
care not as much as
winning so I care about winning and what
I care about is that people like me can
eventually get their free speech back
and we don't get canceled for
so somebody had to get canceled to make
the point a lot of us got canceled to
make the point and maybe someday we'll
get to reverse that but I cared about
winning I didn't care about what you
thought about it and that's very
male so I think Carville is right it is
Classy versus trashy but I'll take
trashy in effective every
day um Trump of course is being attacked
on his personal attacks so people are
saying stop making personal attacks
against comml Harris it makes you look
bad and it's not helping you you should
talk about policies but Trump says quote
as far as the personal attacks I'm very
angry at her meaning K Harris because of
she's done to the country and then Trump
said quote I think I'm entitled to
personal attacks I don't have a lot of
respect for her I don't have a lot of
respect for her intelligence and I think
she'll be a terrible
president what do I think of
that there's a guy saying like ugly
unpleasant things about another
professional running for president I'm
fine with it if it works if it doesn't
work well then I got to problem with it
but do I mind associating with this
terrible terrible
insulting thing that people will call
misogynistic nope I don't have any
problem associating with that at all
does it make my brand look better nope
nope no I will roll around in the mugged
if I'm on the winning team I will walk
through the swamp if I can be on the
winning team I will cover myself with
feces
if I can be on the winning team because
winning is more
important all
right so Miriam adelon the Widow
of what was his first name Adon the
billionaire who passed away but uh both
both of them were big supporters of
trump and uh Miriam is continuing that
and there's suggestion that she's not
even going to put a cap on how much she
would give I guess she gave almost $90
million to Trump in
2020 and uh she looks like she could be
the biggest booster by election day and
one of her one of her people said that
they're going to pay whatever it takes
so she's basically said whatever it
takes we we're going to win and whatever
it
takes so it looks like Trump won't have
a money
problem let's talk about those groceries
stores gouging people so I'm hearing two
different versions one is that the
grocery business has the thinnest margin
of
business and then the Democrats are
saying but the grocery business the food
business they're gouging so I'm trying
to I'm trying to reconcile how could it
be gouging but also small Mar margins of
uh profits well let's dig into it a
little bit I don't have the full answer
but here are some things number one the
grocery
stores are the ones that I consider the
ones with the small
margins I've never I've kind of never
looked into it whether the provider that
puts the food into the sh
stores I don't know what their margin is
so we could be talking about them so we
might be talking about different
entities so if you're talk about the
grocery
store they might have you know small
small or reasonable margins but we don't
know about the um the people who buy it
from the farmers add the markup and the
processing and give it to the stores
maybe they maybe some of them have high
markup now I heard the uh heard some
democrat
complaining that the prices went up
during the pandemic when there were
supply chain problems but then when the
supply chain problem got worked out the
prices didn't go down I think was it van
Jones who said this
and therefore that's an indication of
gouging does that track with you the
prices went up when the supply chain was
limited so it was supply and demand so
the prices went up and then the supply
chain got
fixed but the prices stayed the same so
that's like an obvious signal of gouging
right no it isn't it isn't at all
because the cost went up at the same
time
everybody's cost went up the cost of
fertilizer went up the cost of employees
went up the cost of insurance went up
the cost of energy the main thing that
you need for producing food it all went
up so I don't think that that formula is
even slightly true I don't think that
the food companies just raised their
prices and then just kept them there
because they thought they could get away
with it I mean that might have been a
little while but the free market should
have fix that shouldn't
it wouldn't there be at least one
Supermarket who said you
know I could take 10% off of this and I
sell my competitor by a mile because you
know they're still
overpriced now I'm not sure if the free
market works with grocery stores because
there's been a lot of
consolidation so I'm not entirely
sure that they don't use
anti-competitive you know colluding
stuff but that's a different problem
if if companies are doing
anti-competitive practices the
government already has laws that they
can go after that right that's not about
price
gouging price gouging is a you know it
could be an outcome of that but but you
have a you have a solution for that
which is not price control the solution
is you go after the anti-competitive
behavior if there is
some so uh then the other thing that
Democrats say is that the food companies
made like six billion some food company
made $6 billion last year so obviously
there's
gouging oh my God that's so
wrong no the amount of profit that you
make does not indicate
gouging you can't you cannot infer
anything from
profit nothing the you know if you look
at return on asset or you looked at the
profit margin for any particular good
you could say oh that particular good is
definitely
overcharging but you can't look at just
the net
income and decide that they overcharged
to make
money that's
crazy now now if their entire operation
was a 1 billion dollar operation and
they earned a six billion well okay then
maybe that's starting to suggest there's
some gouging going on or that at least
they could lower the prices there was
not enough competition or something but
if they're in a uh a $200 billion
industry I'm just making up this number
and they've got a six6 billion
profit I don't know is that
gouging how could you how could you tell
just by the number you can't so a lot of
what's going on is Democrats who really
don't understand
economics
or there's something that nobody has
told me that I don't understand
but if I judge by what we
know and what's you know public and
obvious looks like uh looks like just a
real confused argument on the Democrat
side well here's some fun James Blair
who's the political director of the
Trump 2024 campaign and Republican
National Committee so the important part
is that this is this next story comes
from somebody who's got an official role
in the Trump campaign here's what he
says a lot of rumors out there about
kamla having a serious drinking problem
uh oh apparently coming into Focus as
campaign heats up and then he says stay
tuned stay
tuned well there now the Gateway pundit
is also uh uh talking about
this and mentions there there's an
anonymous source on X who's making some
claims about KL Harris having a drinking
problem but it's an anonymous
account so I would count the the
anonymous account uh as
zero just discount that to zero that is
the correct way to deal with that now
don't agree with it because it agrees
with maybe what you think is true it's
an anonymous
account saying she has a drinking
problem that is zero
credibility now I have to say that
because if this were the other way
around and an anonymous person said that
Trump was you know shooting up heroin or
something I would say hold on Anonymous
account zero credibility now zero
credibility doesn't mean it's not true
it just means you shouldn't take that
source as anything so Anonymous equals
zero just keep that in mind but
there are videos of her looking pretty
damn drunk um and uh the fact that uh
it's being now let's say some hints
coming out of the Trump campaign that
maybe they've got more information than
they've revealed so far and maybe the
October
surprise is
this I feel a foreshadowing of an
October surprise now separately somebody
said that KL Harris uh knows so much
about
wine that she can she can talk quite
intelligently about the various
varietals and wine types and she she
often has wine related events and stuff
like that
now I believe that that comes from other
sources as well because it's something
I've heard long before the current
reports and I'm just going to say this
again everybody I know who is a wine
cond se you know who really knows a lot
about wine is an
alcoholic everybody and they they use
their hobby they turn it into a hobby so
it's not so obvious that they have a
drinking problem now that's my
observation um I do think it's possible
you could have somebody who you know has
two drinks a week and they're just
really interested in wine but I haven't
seen it
what I see is that the people who have a
real wine interest are just all
functional alcoholics now they might be
functional most of them are they hold
jobs if you could afford to have a wine
hobby you're probably at least
functioning well enough that you can
hold the
job so I don't know that she's
dysfunctional but uh keep an eye on that
one
meanwhile um Kyle Becker is talking
about a there's a former student of uh
Tim wals Minnesota Governor wals uh
saying that uh he secretly worships the
Chinese Communist so remember there were
uh students he would bring from America
over to China so this sounds like he was
one of those students and the student
said quote it was almost a daily
Revelation how much he end he adores the
Communist Regime and the student told
something called Alpha news Minnesota
that uh there's no doubt he was a True
Believer meaning in the Chinese system
um a student named Shad said I've been
trying to tell people this for 30 years
nobody wants to listen at night we'd go
out we'd walk the street fairs we'd be
buying souvenirs and Tim was always
buying the Little Red Book that would be
Ma's Little Red Book he said he gave
them his gifts I saw him buy at least a
dozen on the trip
now can we conclude from him buying a
dozen of Ma's little red books that he
therefore was a
fan of the Chinese system or whatever
the little red books said about
communism uh it's it's definitely
raising a
flag but you could also imagine how he
would think that that would be the more
educational gift
gift I mean he was a teacher so yeah I'm
going to try to be fair about
this the the fairness in me says if
you're a
teacher and you want people to
understand the you know sort of the
history of
China I could see it I could see him
thinking that that was a better gift
than a trinket you know what's a trinket
worth how many of you want like a vase
that came from China
so it it could be that he's just a nerd
and he's really interested in the
politics of things and he thinks that if
you don't have a copy of the Little Red
Book You'll miss you know some of the
flavor of what has G on there in the
past
maybe but is it a red
flag yeah yeah a little bit a little bit
I'm not I'm not going to conclude that
this proves anything and also we don't
know who Shad is right it's a little
publication talking about a person I
don't know who may or may not exist so
I'm going to put the I'm going to put
the reliability of this one at
low so I'm not going to put much
credibility in this
story tuer Carlson on his podcast I
think he was talking to Comic Dave Smith
um talking he was so Tako was talking
about wal being creepy he says that guy
not babysitting my kids like no
way so tuer went on a little bit about
how uh wal gives off a creepy Vibe
and I'll tell you I sure I sure feel it
now again A vibe is not a proof of any
bad behavior whatsoever I don't have any
evidence of anything like that but why
do I get that Vibe so
strongly all right let's here's an
update on UFOs you know yesterday I
guess or the day before there were a
bunch of UFOs spotted in Southern
California here are two things that you
should ask yourself about UFOs number
one if it has blinking
lights what are the odds that it that
came from another
planet blinking
lights do our spaceships have blinking
lights
no why would you need them
and if you had blinking lights why would
they be on when you visited Earth and
you were looking down at all the people
looking up at you isn't the last thing
you do if you were a UFO is have
blinking lights so that the other
aircraft can avoid you now if it has
blinking lights or any kind of Lights
I'm pretty sure that means made in made
in
Earth all right you're not going to talk
me out of that if it has lights it was
made on on
Earth here's the second one have you
noticed that all the UFOs are about the
size of a
car a human car you know some a little
bit bigger some might be smaller but why
are they all about the same size as what
a human would expect a humaniz alien to
be
in wouldn't the size and age of the
universe make it entirely possible that
if a spaceship ever did visit the Earth
it could be as big as New
Jersey and the people inside it could be
as big as
mountains what would pred is there
anything that would make that
impossible remember if if the if the
aliens evolved on Earth they might have
to fit a certain
size because our Earth gravity Etc you
know creates some challenges but if they
were anywhere
else what size could they be couldn't
they be as big as the whole
planet why why won't we see a spaceship
that's the size of our entire
planet there's nothing that that rules
that out is there so if you continue to
see UFOs that are conspicuously the size
that you expect a UFO to
be it's probably not
real probably not real so lights and
size look for those two things plus
blurry pictures those are uh your tells
that that's not from another
planet apparently Trump is hammering on
kamla for being a communist and uh she's
being called Kami Kami Kamala and I
guess Trump
uh he reposted a meme that made it look
it was an AI generated thing that made
it look like it was a big uh Chinese
Communist convention that kamlo was
talking about now I was trying to think
how persuasive do you think that
is is it persuasive to say that Harris
is a
communist my my first impression was
no that it's too conceptual and you know
just it seems like not something people
would Embrace but then I wondered about
people who are older than
me you know so people who had maybe a
little bit more experience when
communism was a bigger thing I wonder if
uh seniors are more triggered by oh no
she might be a communist I don't know so
I don't have a good read on whether this
is good persuasion in
2024 but uh I don't know anybody who
would change their vote because of
it I mean it's enough to say that price
controls never worked anywhere and will
destroy destroy everything you don't
really need to also say it's communist
because then people start worrying about
the definition of communist and they'll
they'll be like well it's not Central
planning
so so I'm I'm just not seeing the
Communist attack as being the most
effective maybe maybe a
little
anyway uh over at the hill there's a
writer uh whose name is Julia Manchester
huh that's a weird name for a woman
isn't it her last name is
Manchester it's got man and chest in it
I'm a
Manchester here's what she says about uh
Trump um she said he campaigned in uh in
Pennsylvania and that he went after KLA
Harris's physical
appearance oh wow oh you bastard oh you
you bastard jump you went after physical
appearance oh so so terrible I wonder
what he said and then other people said
that he proved that he was a a
narcissist and they showed definitions
of narcissism oh my
God what did he say what did Trump say
that made him look like a misogynist uh
insulter of a woman's appearance my God
she's running for president she's been a
senator she's a vice president he goes
after her appearance come on and then
and then he proves he's a he's a
narcissist which can be proven by
looking at the definition of narcissism
and then looking at what he said and
sure enough he's not only a horrible
trashy
sexist he's a
narcissist what was it he said well
here's what he
said uh quote I am much better looking
than her Trump told supporters uh I'm a
better looking person than
Kamala and uh then I think he made fun
of how his hair is
real
okay does Julie Manchester not know he's
joking did she write a whole article in
the hill as if she thought he was
serious that he's better looking than
Kell
Harris was that taken as a serious
comment and then the people who
researched his mental
health who has the mental health problem
the person who can't identify a
joke or a
trump how weird is this he literally
just makes a joke that's obviously just
a joke and it's in a way it's like his
version of
self-deprecation Trump's version of
self-deprecation is to say he's
handsome because he's a certain age he's
a certain weight yeah he's got a few
wrinkles
and so because you know it's not true
that's why it's funny it's funny because
he knows you
know that he's not better looking than
KL Harris how do you not understand that
how how could you listen to that comment
and think he was being serious and that
he was going after her
looks that was self-deprecating it's
just the way he does it which is
funny that's a real head Shaker anyway
uh
um so also on the all-in podcast the one
they call
freedberg uh was pointing out the the
following thing that uh boing was given
$4.2 billion by Nas NASA to build the
Starliner and they've had zero
successful flights so far they're
currently connected to the International
Space Station and can't disconnect so
that's not successful so they got 4.2
billion to build one thing that has
never worked and at the same year NASA
gave SpaceX musks company uh less 2.6
billion to BU to build crude Dragon
which has had 13 successful crude
flights so
far so musk 13 successful flights Boeing
spent a lot more they're up to
zero and musk just commented on that
accurate
accurate there was a some kind of
shooting that happened at uh a us uh
base in America in Texas so the uh Joint
Base at San Antonio Lackland and that
somebody came up or a group of people
came up and started firing they opened
fire on I don't know who shot first but
there was a gun battle outside the
fort uh from some people who came up and
started shooting at the Fort and the
fort shot back have you ever
wondered how hard it would be for you to
take a shot in the United States if you
were guarding a fort in the United
States and some car drove up the
fort how hard would it be for you to
take the shot in the United States like
if it's a foreign war it's an easier
shot but you're looking at what probably
is a carful of
Americans and you you know they may up
they may be up to no good but that's got
to be hard to take that shot and so they
got in a gun battle now if the car is
shot
first it's a lot easier but even
still hard to be in the military and
take a shot at what looks like
Americans anyway um so we'll we'll hear
more about that that was just
breaking uh according to the telegraph
over in the UK
um extreme misogyny is to be treated as
terrorism that's right if you say things
that somebody says is Extreme misogyny
that can be treated as terrorism in the
UK and uh as Michael shellenberger has
been on this story quite a bit says that
soon in the UK you'll be able to report
your sexist Uncle as a terrorist threat
to the
police
literally you can just call the police
and tell them your uncle's a terrorist
cuz he's being such a
misogynist like actually really I think
there's no hyperbole there I think this
is just literally true you can just call
the police and turn in your
uncle oh my God so stay out of the
UK it appears that they have
fallen that ladies and
gentlemen concludes my prepared remarks
uh if you didn't know the Dilbert reborn
comic um recently dealt with dogbert
being the
space uh the space flight consultant and
what to do about that uh rocket that's
stuck to the International Space Station
he's got some
ideas all
right um thanks for joining on X and
YouTube and Rumble I'm going to talk
privately to
my uh subscriber on locals where they
get a lot more including every single
night we get together and
uh we uh just hang out so in the evening
case case you wondered on the locals
platform which is subscription not only
do you get a whole another daily comic
robots read news I do every day but you
get uh you get a classic Dilbert a brand
new every
day a spicier Dilbert and lots of memes
and hanging out so in the evening I go
to my man cave and uh we just hang out
so sometimes I have something
interesting to say but not usually it's
usually it's literally for people who
didn't have any human
contact so for
example
um you know I expect to go this weekend
with no human
contact so when I hang out
with the uh the other people who had no
human contact we're really glad to get
together and it makes a difference you
