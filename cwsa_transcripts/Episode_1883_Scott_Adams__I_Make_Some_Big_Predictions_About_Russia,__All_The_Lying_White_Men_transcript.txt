good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of human
civilization nothing's ever been better
nothing ever will be until tomorrow
and today is so awesome
that I almost thought to myself well
today I I don't even think we'd need a
simultaneous sip everything's so good
but then I thought why would we ever
settle for less no no I say no
exactly
we need the simultaneous step and for
that all you need is a copper among our
glass a tanker jealous of sign that
canteen jugular flask a vessel of any
kind Fiddler with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens an hour ago
ah
well good news for you
I think I solved one of my biggest
mysteries
and maybe one of yours too
one of my biggest mysteries is why
people hate me so much
and you see me talk about it's like why
do people hate me so much and so I
watched yesterday's live stream back
oh now I get it
totally get it
I'm being honest here I watched myself
yesterday and I looked at it I thought
oh
that's why people don't like me I
totally got it
it's kind of a it's kind of a major you
know mind spinner it's like okay all
right I got it I got it I see it now
here here's what my
um a working hypothesis is
right and it goes like this
some of you are missing context
if you miss the context boy do I look
like an
I totally get it
and I realize that not everybody has the
right context
so if you saw it without context it
would be pretty harsh
here's the context
I believe that some of you believe
that I believe
I'm better than you
true
and I feel like that's sort of behind
that's behind the
um the hatred
what would you say and I think maybe the
people and locals know me better but the
people on YouTube what would you say
would you say that I put off an heir
of looking like I'm somehow smarter or
better than you or something
yeah uh be less better
well or the arrogance yeah arrogance and
particular arrogance would be the right
word
well here's what I think here's some
context you need to know about me
uh I don't think there's any such thing
as a better person
I don't believe that
I I haven't even reproduced
I mean I think the the minimum the
minimum standard for believing you're
better than other people is that you
have children
because you know you're adding maybe
helping the average
but okay maybe that's too far but I
don't even have children like I didn't
even think I was worth reproducing oh
literally I did not think I was worth
reproducing so if you think that I'm
looking at you
like especially people who've had
children
if you think I'm looking at people
who've had children and I think I'm
better than you no way no way my my
ranking of human beings
starts with you know reproductive
success
and I'm below that line I'm way below
average
in my own opinion so one of the reasons
that I work hard to try to you know
produce some value
in my my lifetime as it is is that I
think that I think I need to add some
value
I don't think I've done enough
I don't have a high enough opinion of
myself that I can retire and live on my
Laurels I'll think well
I did all that good work now I guess
everybody will see that I'll just enjoy
it I don't think that at all I'm in a
continuous state of thinking that I
haven't done enough
and that you know damn it I should I
should step it up a little bit but it
always always has been like that so
here's the thing
my view of people
is that almost everybody's good at
something
is probably different than what other
people are good at and that's the
beginning of the end of the story of
who's awesome and who's not
to me
that's the beginning of the end
and you know I told you yesterday that
one of the reasons I like the lgbtq
community like a little extra
and I've added R and I to that so now
it's
lgbtqri to get Republicans and in cells
as well so you get all the all the
non-standard stuff in one bucket because
I love my non-standards
I love non-standard people
so I think I think if you understand my
context which is I'm not telling you
that I'm better than you or anybody's
better than you or anybody's better than
anything like I never even think that
way I just think that some things are
suited for some purposes
and some things are not
so if you put me in let's say the middle
of a shooting War
like you just hand me a gun and plop me
into you know some hot War
how am I going to do
well I don't know I don't know but
probably not great
I don't feel like that's where I would
Excel probably
but that but if you drop me into a
Scrabble competition
oh you do okay
but do I say to myself I'm better than
you because I could beat you as Scrabble
but you could beat me at protecting your
house or something no it doesn't make
any sense it's just somebody has one
skill somebody has some other skill so
if I could simply allow that your
opinion of me could probably never be as
low as my own opinion of myself and by
the way I'm not complaining about that I
I like keeping my own opinion of myself
you know as low as possible because I
think that keeps me out of trouble
because I don't have a I don't have a
bad ego
maybe you noticed right like I don't
have an ego problem so I I actively try
to make sure that I'm not seeing myself
as anything special because it doesn't
make sense there's no logic to support
it
all right but I do like to uh think I
can do more than I can do and I
recommend you do the same you should
always think you could do a little bit
more than you can do
you know why
because it's usually right you usually
can do a little bit more than you think
you can do so I always
place my self-image just ahead of what I
think I can do and then something to
shoot for
there's a new study or maybe there was
two of them I I saw it I saw two
different studies about coffee helping
you to live longer
and one of my thoughts that decaf
doesn't work
and another one said decaf does work but
not nearly as well as actual coffee
so I think there might be two separate
studies
am I wrong that there are two of them
that came out about the same time or was
there one study that people wrote about
incorrectly once I don't know but
no matter what it looks like coffee is
good for you huh
am I right again yes I am
well I continue to be amazed and
impressed at the uh
at the success of the five
on Fox News so now it's uh it just broke
a record it averaged 3.3 million of
viewers to finish as the most watched
cable news program
uh as Fox News offering swept the top
seven it was the first time in history
that a non-prime Time cable news program
has topped the category for four
consecutive quarters
it's just killing it
now
I like to give the shout out that I
always give it Fox News no matter what
you want to say about them you know you
can all be critics we can all be critics
no matter what you want to say about Fox
News the one thing you have to give them
is that they're better managed and
better produced than anybody
now that your your brain automatically
goes to the hosts right of their talent
but how did that Talent get there
like the talent didn't hire itself right
somebody had to say you know Greg
Garfield would be good on the five and
he should have his own show
all right this is management decisions
the talent doesn't make these decisions
and when you see how well they have
managed not only their talent
but the entire design of things what's
great about the five is not just the
people it's the design of the show it's
just designed really well
so I I don't think the producers of Fox
News ever get enough credit because you
always talk about the hosts but damn you
know I've and I've had personal
experience being on a number of
different networks and they're
absolutely the best so their their
success is completely
because they have better skilled people
doing the work I think I think that's it
yeah
um so it's fun to watch and so I knew uh
tweet today that uh somebody figured out
how to make hydrogen using the water
from the air
I didn't realize that hydrogen one of
its big limiters was access to fresh
water
did you know that I didn't know that I
didn't know that fresh water access was
the big problem with hydrogen or one of
them but apparently now they can suck
the water out of the air in enough
quantity that they can
that they can do hydrogen we're talking
about hydrogen storage and Power energy
production so I'm completely convinced
that there's going to be a breakthrough
that looks and feels like this one maybe
not this one but something in batteries
or something in storage in general might
be hydrogen
or maybe some combination of them but
we're only a few inventions away from
solving everything
am I wrong we're just we're really it's
just storage
if you get storage right and apparently
there are all kinds of good ideas for
how to do that
we're going to be in really good shape
as a planet
yeah
the Hindenburg the last time we danced
with hydrogen
there's always somebody who's going to
bring up the Hindenburg
you know you're not totally wrong I
suppose anything could blow up but I'm
not sure that's exactly my mind did not
automatically go to it's all going to
blow up
Ah that's funny
so this Trump document story where just
when you think a story could not be more
boring
it's about documents
somehow you throw Trump in there and
automatically it's a good story
how in the world
do boxes of documents become world news
for weeks and weeks on them it's a box
of documents for God's sakes but here's
the new twist
uh apparently we have some confirmation
that the box of documents with all these
top secret records includes and this
would be stuff that the FBI apparently
has in their possession
would include things like Trump's
medical documents and correspondence
related to taxes and accounting
information
now that doesn't necessarily mean that
those documents are like super sensitive
because they could be generic things
I mean it might be an email saying you
know it's time for his checkup or
something but
how creepy is it that the FBI got their
hands on the stuff that nobody's
supposed to get their hands on
that's pretty pretty creepy
pretty creepy yeah so that does change
how you feel about that story doesn't it
suddenly you say to yourself what like
the entire story to me changes the
moment you say that there's something in
those boxes that they took that is
personal as soon as you tell me they
took personal stuff
whole different idea of what's going on
there
and again it might turn out that that
you know quote personal stuff is not
really that personal and it might be
kind of generic
but
there's no way in the world that you can
be comfortable with this situation this
is so uncomfortable
do you think if uh if Republicans own
Congress let's say after the midterms
and Biden is still president for two
more years do you think they'll impeach
him
and if so for what
I think they'll impeach him out of
Revenge
yeah probably and I don't think they
need a reason which
actually I would normally I would not be
in favor of payback deals
normally not in favor but here's what
they should do
they should impeach Biden on very weak
charges it doesn't even matter what they
are and and you should be told you
should be told the public oh it doesn't
even matter if these are good charges
we're just going to impeach them because
that's what we do now
because the Democrats have created the
standard
that you can just impeach a president
for
so we're going to impeach him for
 because we have the votes and
that's the only reason we're just going
to do it because we have the votes
because that's what they did
in my opinion they appeached they
impeached Trump just because they had
the votes
there wasn't really another reason
so I think that they could make that
concept go away by using Biden as a
sacrificial lamb because it doesn't
matter I mean he could get he could get
impeached 25 times and it wouldn't
affect his job performance right I mean
it doesn't make any difference so if it
doesn't make any difference it's nothing
but a bad mark on your on your record
they should impeach him just under
principle
just and and just say it oh no these are
not really good reasons
but that's not what we do anymore now
we're going to show you that this
process has been corrupted by impeaching
him on weak charges
that will even tell you the weak charges
we're just going to do it right in front
of you and tell you why
here's why
because if they want to play that game
we play that game
if you don't want to play that game we
won't either
but if you want to
we're all in we're all in on that game
I can see that
so normally it wouldn't be in favor of
tip for Tad but I think you
have to make a point of it
I mean I would do it for the
communication benefit of it just to make
the point
um
apparently on Bill Maher's show last
night I didn't see it but Fox News is
reporting that when Bill Morris
suggested uh replacing Kamala Harris
um that there was Applause
now why that's important is he has a he
has a liberal audience
so a liberal audience is spontaneously
applauded the idea of replacing their
own person
that's bad
can you can you imagine a republican now
if it were Mike Pence sure because you
know there's something specific about
that case
but in general that's a pretty radical
thing and Bill Maher is even saying that
as old as Biden is and he's not yeah I
think Bill Maher is completely you know
opened my let's say he's completely
aware that Biden is degraded
I'm sure he knows that
but he's still saying well he's sort of
getting the job done and it's hard to
remove somebody once they're in office
and just replace the VP
what do you think
I think he's right from a political
perspective
not right in terms of who I want to be
president I don't want old presidents
don't want I don't want Trump to be
president because he's too old
if he's the only choice
versus Biden then you have to make a
choice but if I had a choice I don't
want presidents that old
if I have a choice
but I actually agree with Bill Maher
that once once Biden is in there and
they know they can just put him in front
of a lectern and here's here's the key
part apparently it doesn't matter what
Biden says
it doesn't matter if he makes gaffs it
doesn't matter if he thinks there are
ghosts in the room you know that's what
the Republicans say that's not really
what's happening but
I don't know you know the if you had
told me that a daughtering uh old
dementia patient
could do the job of President I would
have said well obviously not
but after two years of watching it
my opinion is whoever's handlers are are
the ones running the country
one assumes but I haven't seen I have
not yet seen maybe you could correct me
have you yet seen an instance in which
Biden being mentally degraded
has actually made a difference
has it made a difference
because I haven't seen it have you
it's kind of an eye-opener that you
could have a brain dead president and
you can't find the difference after two
years
now somebody you know you mentioned
Afghanistan now I don't think it's fair
just simply mention things that went
wrong
because do you think that the
president's the only one who had a hand
in something that went wrong
I imagine his advisors were every bit as
as involved in that as everything else
so I'm not sure that it's obvious that
anything is because Biden was degraded
it might be that they make bad decisions
as a group there's plenty of evidence of
that but there's not evidence that the
reason for the bad decision is that
Biden is degraded
now I'm not saying you should take a
chance on that I mean I wouldn't take a
chance if I had a choice I would never
take a chance on somebody that old but
you don't really see it
am I wrong
you can see errors Afghanistan for
example you can see errors
but you can't you can't really tie them
to
some specific mental degradation
can you
think you can
well if you think you can and you might
be right meaning that you know it's
entirely possible
that everything about Afghanistan going
wrong was purely about Biden not having
all of his faculties that's completely
possible
yeah very possible it's just that you
can't prove it right
there's nothing you could prove that
just clearly because of his mental state
you just know it's true
because you're just smart and you just
figure it must be true
because you might be right but what we
don't know is the degree to which his
advisors
can stop anything crazy
because I feel like they could stop
everything crazy
don't know but I think they could
I I see in all caps wrong wrong
wait a minute how many times should you
write wrong in capsule Wrong five wrongs
you know if you'd stopped with four
capitalized wrongs
I would say to you that that argument is
weak but when you throw in that fifth
wrong
well I have to take that under
consideration now because you make a
strong case
um
I saw a great thread by a Constantine
kison and I don't know anything about
him except that he says he's a he's been
a translator for years and he helped
translate uh Putin's speech
now apparently if you hear Putin's
speech translated and you hear the whole
thing not just a little clip you get a
completely different idea
of what he's all about
which is a huge mine spinner
because didn't you think you sort of
knew what he was about
but maybe not
it turns out that if you listen to his
words that what Putin is really bitching
about is Decades of American uh bullying
basically and America trying to put his
boot on every little country including
Russia
so
let's see looking at a funny meme going
by uh so Putin's argument is that
America does everything it can
financially
economically militarily and in every
every possible way it can influence
things to keep down everybody who's not
America
and that would include Russia and so
that really Russia is fighting for all
the little guys who are being abused by
the American
me
I I'm glad that you could be here for
the first time I've tried to pronounce
that word
foreign
thank you
yes it's all about our hydronomy
I've literally never said that word out
loud you know I've read it for years I
know what it means I never said it
because in a conversation you would
never use that word would you
yeah you might write it down but who
says that word out loud it's sort of a
douchebaggy thing to say
all right
so what do you think about that
I don't know if that's really what Putin
cares about
but apparently he's been saying it
forever
and it does
it does match up with what you observe
right
is it is it not observable that America
does try to put his boot on anybody
again
I think that's true yeah that's true now
but do you think that's the reason
that Putin is trying to fight back and
you know be such of a and be such of a
problem based on Ukraine
yes and no yes and no
I feel like if you believe that the
United States is this big bully and you
see them pushing into Ukraine that
really is too far
it really is if your world view is that
the United States has just gone too far
doing everything
up until Ukraine and then it and then it
tries to get control over your next door
neighbor
that you think you sort of owned
yeah I can see why that would start a
war
yeah so it all makes sense in terms of
Putin's view that you know only Russia
maybe is strong enough to stand up to
the hegemony of the United States
but the other view is that he's just a
Tyrant who wants more stuff so it's more
about his legacy
and maybe those are all the same thing
maybe there's no difference between
those maybe his legacy involves standing
up to the edge out of me
of the United States
um
but let me tell you what I think is
going on so you know Russia annexed the
four regions one of the four
is
got intense fighting and the ukrainians
allegedly
now you all know the rules when I talk
about Ukraine right if I talk about the
war you all know the rules
everything I say
is subject to not being true
because it's it's still the fog of War
we don't really have good reporting so
we know what the ukrainians tell us we
know what the Russians tell us and none
of that is credible right none of that's
credible
but
it does seem that the reporting is
saying that
the ukrainians have surrounded
five thousand Russian troops that are
trapped in one area in one of these four
regions
now
the reporting again who knows how much
is true the reporting is that the
Russian troops that are trapped
asks for permission to retreat and were
rejected
meaning that their choices are to fight
to the death
somehow break out on their own you know
or go on the fence or something but
basically the ukrainians have 5 000
trapped Russians that they're just going
to kill
they're just going to kill them all now
if you lose five thousand
in one battle
that's not looking good for your team
now let me ask you this under what
conditions would uh Putin allow 5 000
people 5 000 soldiers to die
being surrounded without sending massive
reinforcements
what condition would that
would he not send massive reinforcements
you're saying if they're constrips and
he doesn't care about them that's not
where I'm going
lack of resources yeah lack of resources
unless it's not true right the other
possibility is none of it's true and
there's nobody being threatened at all
possible
but yeah okay you don't need to tell me
that it's a hoax or it's a false report
because that's already stipulated right
for the purposes of this conversation it
is stipulated we all understand that
none of the information is credible
but if we were to treat it as though it
were what would you conclude from that
not not that you should trust it
here's what I think
I think that everything we've seen is
suggestive of a near collapse of the
Soviet military
like a near total collapse and I think
that the United States and NATO probably
sees that this is an opportunity for a
complete collapse of the Russian
military
and they're going to take it and I don't
think it's about Ukraine anymore I think
the battles for Ukraine is over
in terms of strategic interests I think
at this point the United States is
trying to
um
put a death blow on the entire Soviet
military
and I believe I heard General Keane say
the other day that um if somehow you
know Russia used a nuke or somehow
brought the U.S military in
Keane's view is that the U.S military
plus NATO would just eliminate the the
Russian military
released all the assets on the ground it
would just eliminate them it would just
be gone
now do you think that's true do you
think that there's so at this point
because that we're watching Ukraine kick
the shin out of the Soviet military just
using the you know our weapons and and
Logistics I assume
if we if we actually used our best
weapons and all of them
I feel like the Russian the entire
Russian military would be destroyed in
in a week or something that would be
bloody and nobody wants that right it's
certainly not what we want but to me it
looks like the U.S strategy has changed
from protecting Ukraine because I think
they think they've done that
and and yes they're battling over the
um the annexed areas
and that will continue but that's going
to continue no matter what because
Ukraine is not going to give up as long
as they have resources from us
so I feel like our we've completely
changed our uh
our goal I think the goal is complete
collapse of the Russian system
and that
um
and that we're doing that either to get
rid of Putin or to get him so flexible
that you would join our team
and I do think that this is the time to
negotiate
because in my view I think Putin can see
that there's actually a very serious
chance
I think more than 50 percent
that that the entire Russian military is
is going to collapse
I mean actually like they can't even
give an order to mount a defense
I think there will soon be a point where
they can't even order a military
military movement they won't be able to
order an attack nobody will attack
so I don't know if that'll happen so I'm
not predicting it'll happen I think
we're really close not not close to a
collapse of Russia
but to a place where the the military is
just going to say this
we don't have any chance of winning
we're done we don't have any chance of
winning and there's nothing we're
fighting for
those are the two conditions that should
completely
completely and
yeah so I'm going to change my
assessment completely from it's a battle
for uh Ukraine I don't think it is
anymore
I think this is a survival battle for
Russia and I don't think the odds are in
their favor
at least surviving in the way that they
have always been I think that they they
may be close to permanently
disabled as a modern country
unless they change leadership and I
don't think they will
so they'll probably keep their
leadership and just ride Putin all the
way down
I think
yeah they'll survive as a country but
it's not going to be the same country
foreign
so Tesla is uh starting to introduce
their new Optimus robot a Tesla robot
and with mass production maybe get it
down to a twenty thousand dollar
robot
twenty thousand
um
and apparently Elon Musk has said that a
robot business a Tesla robot business
will be worth more than its car business
what do you think of that
you believe that do you believe that the
robot business will be bigger than the
car business
totally
in fact I believe that the car business
is actually just a starter business
right the big businesses are space and
robots
car cars were just the entry cost I in
my opinion
in my opinion
musk is probably not very interested in
cars
I don't even think he's interested
I I mean I already know is he a car guy
I'm not even sure he owns one
I think cars were totally as it turns
out I don't know if it was a master plan
but as it turns out it's just the the
entry ticket to robots Tesla robots
would be by far the bigger business by
far maybe a hundred to one I don't even
think it's close potential wise
yeah robots will be cars because I the
the long-term uh future of cars is
shared cars
tell me I'm wrong the long-term future
of cars is you don't own one it's a the
only reason that you own a car is either
you like one or there's something you
can't do unless you own one
and the things that you can't do without
a car will you know are fewer and fewer
as long as you can Uber
so if Uber became cheaper and more
available and it was easier to take long
trips or it's self-driving
there are lots of times you don't want
to be in a car because you want to have
a conversation or something right you
don't want a driver
so as soon as you make the the cars
self-driving
you get rid of all the problems of of
uber
right a hundred percent of uber problems
are the driver
am I right now I'm exaggerating right
sometimes the car breaks down but
basically all of the problems with Uber
are the driver
the driver is the dangerous one
right so you get rid of the driver which
is guaranteed it's guaranteed the cars
will have no drivers there's no question
about that
because it's only a matter of time
before the car less driver is way safer
way safer than the The Driven car
and I think we're already there frankly
yeah Muscat musk says we're already
there and I I agree with that I think we
are are there it would be a different
kind of
danger so it's hard to compare but we're
already there I think
so yeah uh cars I think will go away as
a business except for the self-driving
ones so there'll be far fewer of them
and robots will be increasing forever
there's never going to be an end to when
you need a robot
and I don't think you can share a robot
because they work inside your house or
inside your factory right it's not going
to be like you you can't Uber a robot
you got to have your own robot so yeah
that's better
all right I did a little uh poll today
and I asked the following question I
said if you are a hiring manager in
Corporate America
now all of the words here are important
you are the hiring manager and it's
Corporate America so it's not small
business
is Corporate America
and you have two candidates there's one
uh black male and one white male
and they're identically qualified
identically exactly qualified
who do you hire in Corporate America
well two-thirds of the people said they
would hire the black candidate
two-thirds one-third of the people lied
or were stupid or had uh have no
experience in Corporate America
whatsoever Because the actual answer is
100 percent
foreign
this is one of those questions where no
no there's no actual ambiguity about
this one
a hundred percent of hiring managers
I'm a white guy
I would hire the black guy 100 of the
time
if everything else is equal right
everything everything's equal the only
difference is Black or White
I will hire the black one 100 of the
time
every time
now let me explain this for people who
are who have not taken economics
you walk up to a table and there's two
piles of money
and there's a sign that says you may
have one pile of money or you may choose
two piles of money help yourself
which would you take
well apparently one-third of the people
who answered my poll
said they would take the one pile of
money when both piles of money were
available
so if you need any more evidence that
they're lying
I don't think I could give you any more
evidence of that of course they're lying
they're all lying they're either lying
or they're really dumb or they have no
experience whatsoever
take them both
here are the two piles of money in this
hiring example
right one pile of money is you get a
good employee because remember it was a
good employee either way
equally good exactly is good so you got
your free money because you got a good
employee and then you've also improved
your diversity which in Corporate
America is 100 guaranteed
to be good for you as a hiring manager
because people are looking for that
right so why would you take
a good employee when you could have a
good employee and you could get a
benefit from having more diversity
because that's how you're graded
it's a no-brainer
right now what happened when I
challenged people on this online
well do you think that I was seriously
interested in their opinions
no of course not
because I already know exactly what
people think there's no there's no
question about what people think I was
very interested how they would lie
and how they lied it was very similar
the Kobayashi Maru
so I was intentionally seeing how many
people would go
Kobayashi Maru on me so if you look at
the comments that are on that poll
you could have a good laugh so here's
the setup
Corporate America not talking about
small business
small businesses in my opinion
hire people who look like them
usually right now if they can't get an
employee who looks like them and can do
the job then they'll be more flexible
but in my in my view a small black owned
company is more likely to hire black
small Asian owned companies more likely
to hire Asian small white company is
more likely to hire White
so I'm not talking about small companies
anybody who wants to argue that they
still discriminate I would say of course
that's the most obvious thing in the
world just look at any of them
you can walk into almost any small
company and whatever the ownership is
you're going to notice coincidentally
there's a lot of people who work there
and look like that right so we're only
talking about Corporate America
and I say you've got a black end
or male and a white male and they have
identical qualifications but then I add
this
assume all other variables are the same
so how did the comments go
well Scott I would I would hire the
white person sometimes because you know
maybe I would hire the person that I
thought had the best personality
to which I say oh okay maybe you didn't
read carefully so I said assume all the
other variables are equal and that would
include their personality oh well yes
Scott but in the real world people are
never identical in the real world so
yeah people are never identical so I
would pick the one who had the best
qualifications okay okay I hear that but
this is a hypothetical
in which hypothetically and
unrealistically just to sort of find out
some insight about how you think we're
going to say that all the other
variables are exactly the same
and then they say well you know I'd
probably hire the one who
seem to have the best character
no
they're exactly the same
they're exactly the same
all right now I could do this all day
long because you know how this goes
right you've been in this kind of
conversation
the the the
uh what do you call it the uh kabarushi
Maru what is that called
I can never remember it
the
Kobayashi Maru right
the Kobayashi Maru is from Star Trek
and it was from a story in which Captain
Kirk was in the academy and he took the
same test that all the new trainees take
and the Kobayashi Maru was a particular
test where the captains the future
captains of the ship would all have to
learn what to do in a no-win situation
so as an artificial situation in which
the computer simulation would make sure
that everything you did was a disaster
you could only lose the only person who
ever beat the the Kobayashi Maru was
Captain Kirk
and how did he beat the only thing the
unbeatable thing
he he snuck in and reprogrammed it so
there was a way to win and then he did
that that way so he cheated yeah he
cheated the only way you can win the no
win is by cheating
so I I set up a situation where people
would either have to admit the obvious
that a white person and a black person
going for a job in America is not the
same it's not even close and and I would
I got criticized for saying that the
black candidate had a five to one
advantage
it's not five to one
[Music]
who would call me
that's 7 43 in the morning
um yeah no it's not a five point it's a
hundred percent
is closer to 100 like 99 of the time
and and the reason is
two piles of money is better than one
there's there's no thinking to be done
here
did I see van Jones I'm Bill Maher last
night I didn't but that would be
interesting now that I know he's on
there I'm gonna watch that
because as soon as you said that you
immediately had my interest
see van Jones is one of the I don't know
dozen people in the country who's at
least willing to tell the truth
and and when he's being purely political
he sort of signals it to you
so you don't mind that either have you
ever noticed that you watch him talking
so when he goes purely politically he
does it so overtly that you go okay okay
that's just some democrat talk in there
I get that but he's also willing
to say whatever is true if
if it makes sense to say it
so I always appreciate his contribution
um
not changing hypothetical mentioning
because said to have friend yesterday
you have Advantage less okay
so
um how do white people ever get jobs in
Corporate America
can anybody answer that question if it's
true
then what did my one of my critics said
by Scott you're ignoring all the
evidence that it's way easier to get
ahead in America if you're white
because look at all these white
successful people and there's still too
many white people in Corporate America
to which I say unless a completely
different topic
let me tell you how white people succeed
oh just keep trying
that's it
so if you get turned down for a job you
just try somewhere else
and do you know what it works every time
because there are more jobs than there
are qualified people
so if you're qualified
and you get turned down for a job you
just try again
try somewhere else until you find a
situation where there's no equally
qualified black person applying and they
have to pick you
so so the the Discrimination situation
in the United States is somewhat masked
by the fact that everybody can get a job
if you have any qualifications in
America you can get a job the employers
are just begging for qualified people
now
now having said this conversation how
many of you would believe I am opposed
to affirmative action
how many of you now have concluded that
based on this conversation and maybe
others that I'm opposed to affirmative
action because I've I've lost two jobs
to affirmative action
personally
yeah it seems like it right because the
normal thing you expect is if somebody
is saying that negative about something
then they must be opposed to it but
here's the problem
what's the alternative
what's the alternative see the the thing
that traps me is that I have an
economics degree and I don't judge
things individually like just floating
in space everything has to be compared
if you don't compare it you haven't done
anything
right so if you ask me okay Scott
suppose you took away affirmative action
and this this is a little bit more about
the past than the present I think
affirmative action completely worked
I think it worked
now it was bad for me
maybe I mean I went on to something
better than being a corporate worker so
maybe I came out ahead I don't know so
I'm not even sure I can see the downside
in in the larger Arc of History
so if he asked me what I would have done
instead of
affirmative action probably nothing I
probably would have done affirmative
action I probably would have done it
very much the way it was implemented
with all of its words and because
I think it did get us to a stronger
place as a country
I think it did
now is it evil to discriminate based on
race of course
so am I do I think it's great that white
men got discriminated against
wildly in some contexts obviously not
all context but and let's say the
specific context that's not perfect
that's not perfect but I don't have a
better idea
so you could say everything that's wrong
with it and I'll agree with every bit of
it every all of that's wrong
and it got to us got us to a stronger
place
because I've got a feeling that
diversity is going to be
um
something that is mostly disadvantaged
at first
but if you play it right you can turn it
into the strongest thing any country
ever had
and that's sort of where we're heading
because as long as America is the place
that says
you know you can get ahead under any
condition and we we stayed true to that
we are the strongest country
nothing can beat that there's nobody who
has anything like that
that is also you know as powerful as us
so do you think that China is saying hey
we'll take the best
uh we'll take the best uh Black
Americans for our scientists hey if
you're if you're a Jewish come to China
because we we like some more Jewish
scientists do you think they're doing
that
I don't think so so don't they have less
access to the best talent yes yes they
do
America will always have access to the
best talent
if we can handle this this diversity
monster
and it is a monster
because it can help you and it can kill
you I mean it's a dangerous kind of a
kind of a thing both both dangerous to
opponents as well as lovers
so
um you can complain all you want about
things that are bad and I have but it
doesn't mean you have a better idea
true story
um and everybody who's got a good talent
stack can succeed in America
that's just the bottom line if you're
not building a set of skills that is
valuable well then good luck it's not
gonna nothing's gonna work for you
but no matter who you are if you're if
you're assembling
the right set of skills that work
together
you're going to be fine in America our
system really does support qualified
people
um it's being unqualified that's a
problem
um somebody asked me why did I say in
the past that I lost my Dilbert TV show
because the schedule got rejiggered
but then more recently I'm saying it
because Dilbert was a white character
and it was a racial thing do you know
why
does anybody know why I used to say
it was just a sort of a schedule thing
but now I say it was it was a racial
thing
because I'm retiring I was lying to you
yep I was lying do you know I was lying
because I'm a white man in America
there's no white man in America who
could tell the truth
do you think any white man in America
could say the truth in public in general
you know just sort of a general thing no
no
yeah a black man can
right a black man can say whatever they
think and it won't offend me a bit
not even a little bit and I wouldn't I
wouldn't hold anybody back for a job I
wouldn't discriminate against them if a
black man said complete truth
the most raw disgusting thing that I
hated to hear it wouldn't bother me a
bit
because in to a large extent I expect
maybe they do
I mean I don't know
same with women
if women wanted to be completely honest
fine
no penalty at all
white man
we cannot be perfectly honest the whole
system would collapse basically white
men lying is what supports the whole
system at this point you know you take
that away and everything will collapse
so no we're not going to tell you the
truth
there's no way we're going to
tell you the truth
because it would be Armageddon
um
now I ran into somebody in the uh in my
gym yesterday who was actually listening
to listening to the recorded version of
this when I passed them in the gym
and so somebody I've known for years and
flagged me down and was
I was probably watching right now so hi
if you're watching right now
um
and was sort of uh
um I'm not gonna say sort of surprised I
guess would be the best word that I've
said as much as I have without getting
canceled yet is anybody else surprised
is anybody surprised that I can have
this conversation and not get canceled
yeah it's the way I do it
it's the way I do it
this is definitely one of those don't
try this at home situations
it's only the way I'm doing it if I did
it even a little bit wrong like I'm
watch I'm walking this little tightrope
you know one step left or right and I'm
dead
and the only reason I would take these
chances
is because number one
I'm more skilled at communicating than
just about anybody
if we're being honest because I do it
for a living I do it at a professional
level right
and not only do I do it at a
professional level
but it's a professional level about
communicating
right because I talk about persuasion
which is communication so I'm not only
just a professional communicator but I'm
a professional who teaches professionals
how to communicate right so in theory
I should know how to do this
but this is way too dangerous for
anybody who's not operating at a
professional level and even at the
professional level is too dangerous and
I'm only doing it because I'm near
retirement
it's the only reason there's no way I
would take a chance otherwise it would
be a stupid chance
so that gives you a good show to watch
but I will say that in my opinion
the world is ready for an honest
conversation
in a way that it has not ever been
before
and I think somehow the the Trump
experience caused this not in any direct
way but I think when Trump made reality
itself up for grabs
suddenly there were just stuff you could
talk about
and and we've gone so far oh and you
know what the other thing is I think the
complete uh and obvious failure of Biden
to be as good as Trump in terms of
governing I think everybody can see it
now they won't admit it of course but I
think everybody can see it
um I think that allows
like a little flexibility that the
people on the left
I guess this is a way to say it the
people who would cancel me
have had uh two years of reality shoved
down their throats
and that two years of reality more than
that actually like five years of reality
it's like the news told you that there
was Russia collusion
oh really the entire news can lie to us
for years
I didn't really see that coming
but I guess that changes how I think of
things
and then these 50 Intel people who say
this this laptop is Russian
disinformation then you find out wait a
minute even my own news is saying that
was a lie
uh I'd expect Fox News to say that but
why is Jake Tapper telling me that
and suddenly the people who were so sure
that everything that they believed was
right and true in the past few years
have learned from their own side
that they had been lied to for years
I feel as if
and how about black lives matter
is there anybody who believes that black
lives matter was a legitimate
organization now the the intentions of
it were legitimate of course so the
individuals Marching In the Street
totally legitimate they had actual
things they cared about but not the
organization the organization we now
know
Beyond any doubt was a sort of a
money-making thing
right and then antifa except for the
Northeast uh special situation antifa
just disappears when they're not needed
anymore
the left
surely you have noticed
surely you have noticed that everyone on
your team was full of
right
now I believe that the people on the
right
have their own criticisms about
Republicans
but I feel like it's all more
transparent
right when when the right says these
Republicans are rhinos or whatever you
know exactly what they're talking about
you know you could agree or not but you
know exactly what you know everything's
transparent
I feel like the left has been lying to
itself
and the right has not
the right has been disagreeing with
itself but it's all out there there's
nothing hidden
seems very different so what I what I
see is that the left is this big
Reckoning uh and the most monstrous
cognitive dissonance bomb of all time
has exploded and just basically
scattered their brains in a hundred
different directions and they're they're
trying now to reassemble
because because their their brains are
actually
fragmented at this point
and that would have happened to you too
if you'd been in that situation so it's
nothing about being a Democrat it's
about being in a situation where
everything you thought was true just
disintegrated
just disintegrated right in front of you
now again
there were probably Republicans when
let's say when Nixon was
outed as being a criminal
don't you think there were a bunch of
Republicans who had to
reassess
you know had been completely Pro Nixon
until they found out he was actually a
criminal like in a pretty big way
and then they're like oh shoot I guess I
got to rethink everything
so I think that's what's happening
uh the left says BLM is uh doesn't need
to be out there because Biden made
everything better yeah yeah Biden
definitely made a police brutality
disappear didn't he
by what by doing what exactly
having having less police
you know maybe the police just aren't
stopping people if they look dangerous
yeah maybe the defunding just means they
don't even do dangerous stuff anymore so
there's no trouble to be had
all right
well
I've managed to babble for an hour I
have uh is a this very topic I missed
today
are you noticing how
non-pushback I got from this topic
like I get I get that this is my
audience and it's people who you know
expect me to talk a certain way but
usually there are a lot more
a lot more trolls on here
you all just went quiet didn't you
see I don't think the world's ready for
me and have you now let me ask you
something else
under what condition
would somebody as prominent as me
prominent and just means somebody that
the news likes to talk about right I'm
not complimenting myself I'm just saying
the news likes to talk about me that's
just a fact
now do you think this will be covered in
the news
just think about what I just said
just just think about how dramatic this
is in terms of people's understanding of
reality
and also how
volatile it is in terms of the single
topic that we care about the most right
race
right
this won't be picked up at all do you
know why
it's too dangerous
if they thought they could cancel me
over it oh they would pick it up fast if
if I'd given them enough cancellation
material oh man they'd be all over it
but do you see how carefully I've laid
it out
I've laid it out so it's a trap that I
think they could tell
you do not want me to have more
attention on this topic
right
is there anything that the the Democrats
would like less than me talking more and
having a bigger audience to say this
shocking thing that they may or may not
agree with
there's no way they're going to give me
more attention
so that's part of what protects me if
they were to cancel me
do you know what I would do
you have any idea how dangerous I would
be fully canceled
like let's say fully canceled like I
lose all my income from newspapers I
mean just think about it
do you have any idea what I would do
I mean there's no way they want to
unleash me that way the only thing that
protects them at all
is that I still like making money
I mean I don't need it but I like it
yeah so there you go
um
no
um I haven't
so here here's my situation
um I've decided to go Reckless
so I've turned down
um or have been canceled on me
um all of the bigger offers
um yesterday I actually got an
invitation from Dr Phil
so Dr Phil wanted to have me on and uh I
would do that you know if I said I'd do
it next year because I'll have a book
tour
um
but I'm you know obviously I would have
said yes to that under normal situation
but I'm just going to go full recluse
for a while because I just don't need it
I don't know why I need to be on other
people's shows
honestly I don't I'm not even sure I
want my audience any bigger than this
because especially the locals audience
so the locals subscribers around 6 000
or so
somehow it seems to be exactly the right
number to act like a like a what I call
a collaborative brain meaning that if I
have any question or problem and also
the other people on there you just bring
it up to the group and then somebody's
got an answer
it's like the most amazing thing is way
better than Google
the fact that I can I can say hey I've
got this problem and six thousand people
most of them quite smart
will give me the answer immediately
uh what about Russell Brand
um well Russell Brand is not a scheduled
so
yeah so any anything you heard that I
said I might go on
nothing is scheduled so I'm not going to
schedule anything
uh did you try turning it on and off
uh if Dilbert gets canceled will you
Market on only fans it's funny you you
say that like
um
like it's a joke
but you know that's what locals is Right
locals is a subscription Network so if
Dilbert gets canceled in all newspapers
I would just move it to locals
and anybody who wanted it could see it
and anybody didn't want it would never
have to see it
yeah and by the way that's that is my
retirement plan I mean it could change
but if I stop doing uh Dilbert
newspapers he will get a lot edgier a
lot funnier because I can be a lot
funnier if I don't have
um any controls on me so right now I
have to write a comic that's you know
basically for a family newspaper that's
the lowest level of Freedom if you give
me a higher level of Freedom it's going
to be way funnier
trust me you'll be way funnier
yeah so that might happen all right
uh
so I you know and and let me give a
shout out to Dave Rubin
all right so Dave Rubin
more than anybody else's reason that I
think that the locals Network exists
and uh only because locals exist can I
speak as freely as I am now
because I don't think I'd want to be
completely income free
yeah even though I could well it's just
something I don't like about that so the
fact that there's you know I have a
place I can go to
that is you know vital and uh profitable
and would meet my needs
then I can take some risks in this big
dangerous world because I've got a
little Safe Harbor that I can escape to
and that is really valuable to me like
as a Creator and as a you know as a
outspoken kind of person that really
matters to me so big big props
to Dave Rubin for for that and by the
way I I always I always think of Dave in
my short list of talent stack Superstars
the people who have
collected a set of talents that just
work so well together
I mean Dave's like the best example I
mean how many things is he good at
like a lot right like you if you started
to make the list you'd say well you know
he looks good on TV I mean that's a good
start you know it speaks well he's funny
he knows politics apparently he knows
how to start a a business
so I mean there's a lot of a lot of
talent
that goes into what he does and uh you
can see the yeah great voice
um he's got the whole the whole stack
all right so
um a lot of the people who do what I do
have the same quality That's The Joe
Rogan thing Joe Rogan is a talented
stack guy for sure
um and lots more all right
did any of the 77 newspapers reinstate
Dilbert no because it was a chain
decision meaning there was one person
who decided for all the papers
and they have to follow the lead because
they get one set of comics
sent from a central place
so they they don't have individual
control of that in fact the whole point
of what the chain was doing was trying
to negotiate group discounts
so yeah I don't think anybody will
change their mind
uh
all right
now do your jokes it somebody's mad
because they didn't make anybody laugh
in the comments
all right now was today better than
yesterday
I see somebody saying that
am I less obnoxious today
a little bit
all right I'll try to adjust
it was actually quite a shocker to when
I watched myself yesterday
like I'm not joking
I'm not joking at all that when I
watched myself I didn't like me like I
actually didn't like me I was like oh
why would I want to be that guy
yeah and this gets to uh one of my most
important advices
if anybody ever tells you to be yourself
though there is a source of bad advice
you should always be looking to be that
slightly better version of yourself and
then when you get there it become a
slightly better version again like if
you're not working toward improving
yourself I don't even want to be around
you you would be a terrible person to be
in the room with
you know if you're not even interested
in being the better version
so
yes there's no age at which I will not
try to fix my game if I if I can
all right uh
even if we agree with the point it still
feels like you were being yelled at
sometimes meaning that it feels like I'm
yelling at you sometimes is that what
you're saying
I can see that so I also I also answered
a second question for myself
I've always wondered why I've never been
in a fight
just like one of those weird things you
know if you're a male
you pretty much you're always around
danger like I always wonder why I've
never been in a fight I've certainly
been in tense situations that could have
been fine and when I watched myself I
think I got a little insight into that
because I've heard that I scare people
and I didn't quite get it until I saw
myself
I guess I could see how that would scare
somebody
because I don't know exactly what it is
there there's something in my mannerism
or voice that looks like I would kill
you if I had to
because that's true
I would kill you if I had to I mean I
want to I'm very peace loving
but I could kill you I wouldn't even
blink
so I think uh if I had to so I think
somehow sometimes that comes through
and I don't mean that to come through
but it does
all right that's all for now I'll talk
to you tomorrow YouTube
