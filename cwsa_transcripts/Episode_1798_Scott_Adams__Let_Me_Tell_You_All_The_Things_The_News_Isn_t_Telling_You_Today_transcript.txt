[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
coffee with scott adams and it doesn't
have to be coffee it could be a beverage
of your choice we're very flexible here
dare i say progressive
no it's okay don't worry about it you
can have your coffee any way you like
conservatively or otherwise but you will
need a copper mug or a glass of tanker
tells us either canteen sugar flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here today the
thing that makes everything better it's
cold
the simultaneous sip
our jean says how can i donate
go to the locals
site and subscribe
go
that's the best ever
well
i'm going to start including
headlines from the babylon b
because it used to be i would say oh
i'm not going to talk about joke
headlines because those are just jokes
those are parodies i'm going to talk
about the real stuff
not much difference anymore
so i feel like i can give you babylon b
headlines just along with the others i'm
not even going to mention where they
come from
so i don't know does this come from the
babylon b or from cnn you decide
here's the headline u.s a recently
published study presented a worrying
statistic regarding the masses of
californians migrating to other states
the study finds 92 percent of those
fleeing the golden state
don't survive the first winter
so it's pretty tragic
don't survive the first winter
um if you were on my
live stream yesterday from locals you'd
have to be a subscriber to see it
you would have seen me discussing the
fact that the word fleeing
is a good word for
comedy
fleeing
you notice it's like study finds 92
percent of those fleeing the golden
state
that's how you know it's the babylon bee
and not cnn that one word is the only
this is the only tip-off fleeing
it's a comedy word
well boris johnson resigned and uh
shinto abe
was murdered so it's a bad day for bad
week for conservative leaders around the
world
uh let's talk about boris first
uh boris uh got fired he resigned but
let's say he got fired uh boris johnson
got fired for partying too much
that's sort of what happened right
[Laughter]
is that what happened
you partied too much
i mean i feel like uh
you know there was like
you know scandals
yeah coven party restrictions he
violated
so basically he was a hypocrite a liar
and he looked too much like donald trump
his haircut
i think that's unforgivable
you know i'm wondering if the um
if the way things work best
is that you get a boris johnson or or a
trump
and they fix stuff
and then you let other people run it for
a while and then until something breaks
then when something breaks you need
somebody to come in and kick some ass
again so i feel like
um
i feel like
maybe
you know the the people who can break
things the best shouldn't be the people
who are running things
because you need the demolition people
to just come in and break everything
and then you need the people who are
just going to get pick up the garbage
so it might not be bad that your boris
johnsons come and then they do their
thing and then they go yeah maybe that's
the very best way it works same with
trump but i wonder i wonder
is the boris johnson situation
the simulation sending us a signal about
trump
now the way we usually talk about it is
is there some trend developing with this
one point of data
that's the way we usually talk
and i don't know that it's a
trend
but maybe the simulation is winking at
us and saying hey hey
we're moving on to a new upgrade and it
doesn't require
people with
non-standard haircuts maybe
the more tragic news and
this is really shocking you know former
prime minister uh
shinto abe am i saying it correct
correctly
um good friend of
president trump's shinzo
shinzo
abe
i'm terrible at the pronunciations
um cern destroyed earth's shields okay
that sounds like a story i don't know
about
so we don't know who killed him right or
why
but he was considered i guess npr
in their little story they called him an
arch conservative
and then they deleted it i guess people
didn't like the way he was characterized
it was a homemade gun somebody says is
that confirmed
because it's very you know
the gun control is very
they have the shooter
and a homemade gun confirmed somebody
says
he printed it oh my god
is that true
two pipes in a plank
no he didn't was not printed okay
so apparently you should not get the
news from me reading comments as they
stream by
turns out that's a very inaccurate way
to get the news
so it wasn't printed but maybe he made
it himself or something
uh it's just a pipe shotgun from the
looks okay
a home depot gun
hardware store items interesting
wow
ex-military you think
or do we know that
it was homemade
interesting
well i don't know what we're supposed to
take away from the story because on one
hand
you know it's notable that they have
strict gun control and the most
probably the most prominent politician
in japan just got murdered in public
but i don't know that it's telling us
anything is it
i mean it's a horrible tragedy but what
did we do we learn anything from it
i don't think so he's an ex-navy
somebody says
yeah i don't know there's probably
i don't think there's necessarily
anything to add to the story it's just
horrible
all right um
i'm watching in
let's say great interest
as the
the covid skeptics you know the the
rogue doctors etc
are still in the game and there's still
studies coming out that you know support
them and or don't
but dr peter mccullough is back in the
news
he and two other doctors were on tv
talking about a swedish study
that allegedly confirms that pfizer does
modify your dna it causes your cells to
produce the toxic spike protein
so that was a
news clip that i saw forwarded around
so let me give you the following context
so that when you see this clip if you do
you'll you'll know how to evaluate
now first of all is it true
that the pfizer
shot does something to modify your dna
well
i don't know i don't know if it's true
i'll tell you what we know
we know that
it's one study
how reliable is one scientific study
just in general
how reliable is one scientific study
probably less than half
would you say that less than half the
time they would be confirmed
is that true now i know in the social
sciences they have a really bad re
reproduction problem
25
25 of the time it's reproducible is that
right
or is that only for the social sciences
where things are a little sketchier
all right well
so the the fact that there's only one
study that should tell you it's not
the the majority likelihood is that it's
not true
is that too strong
if you see one study and it even looks
like a high quality study
can you say without without even knowing
what the topic is
can you say that it's most likely not
true
i feel like that's statistically true
right
most likely not true
if there's a high quality study that
says it is true
historically most likely it's not right
if there's just one study now suppose
there's a second study
you know also high quality gets the same
result
well then you're much better much better
territory right
much better territory i don't know what
the percentages would be but two studies
completely done separately
now you have my attention
one study
it's a flag
but it's not quite news is it
it's just a flag
but here are the other things you should
say about this news
to be an educated consumer of news
and see how many of these you
sort of automatically
got on your own number one
you should have said it's most likely
not true
because there's one study that says is
true how many got that right
from the jump as soon as you heard there
was one study
how many of you said automatically
probably not true
if you did then you're you're a good
consumer of news
all right here's some other things you
should have
thought about if you saw it now i
haven't mentioned this but one of the
doctors doctors simone gold
who also has been very controversial as
one of the rogue doctors
maybe kicked off his social media
kicked off a twitter yes or no give me a
can somebody give me a fact check on
that was she kicked off with twitter
dr simone gold
somebody says very kicked off
somebody says she's still long all right
we can't confirm anything
today's the day we can't confirm
anything
um but she's controversial now one of
the things that she said was that if
it's true
that
the dna is altered
she says that this might create
new avenues for lawsuits
against the
pharma companies because
or against somebody because
it modifies your dna and there's some
law that says you can't discriminate
against people with different dna
and so the idea was
the idea was
that because dna is involved
and you can't discriminate against
people who have different dna
that gives you some kind of avenue
for i guess you know objecting
to be you know banned if you're not
vaccinated i guess
now
that's stupid right
am i right is there are there any
lawyers on here
there always are there's always a few
lawyers all right she's not a lawyer
but
correct me if i'm wrong her
her legal theory she's a lawyer somebody
says
she's not a lawyer is she i think she's
a doctor
she is a lawyer
no way
are you serious
is she a doctor and a lawyer
she's both
all right so this is even more
interesting
this is even better than i thought
in my opinion as a non-lawyer
her legal take is stupid
like i'm not a lawyer and i'm evaluating
somebody who you say is a lawyer
and i'm not changing my opinion
do you think there's any existing law
about you know discrimination based on
dna do you think there's any law that
this would apply to
i don't see it
i don't see it all right here's the
thing
i see people complaining and i'm not
going to let this go all right usually i
don't dump on people who are on the
locals platform because they're
subscribers but i'm not going to let
this go
i'm seeing a complaint that i'm talking
about a topic that i don't understand
again
that's the show
right if you can't deal with that
don't watch
this is the show
i deal with you it's interactive you
correct me i correct you you correct me
i correct you that's how it works a lot
of this is breaking news we haven't
looked into it we're just trying to
figure out just like everybody else so
if your complaint is that i don't
understand thoroughly the topic you are
so in the wrong universe
because nobody understands any of these
goddamn topics if there's anything i can
teach you is that nobody understands
them in fact that's going to be the
biggest theme today even the experts
don't know what the they're doing
so if you think the problem is i don't
understand the topic you're right
but it's a dumb comment because
nobody understands the topics nobody
that's the context of all of this
nobody understands the topics
all right
so uh i invite you to unsubscribe please
um
so listen here are the other reasons you
should
maybe be skeptical of this new
information about the pfizer shots
uh first
the you know first the legal part
sounded so dumb to me that it degraded
my opinion of their medical
uh opinions
so maybe that sounded the same way to
you or maybe you know more about the law
than i did and it doesn't
here's the part that was glossed over in
the video that we saw
one of the hosts asked directly and this
is the most important question
they asked so what
that's the big question right
so that so dr
mccullough said you know that
the study shows that you know the dna is
modified in in this particular way
the host correctly says
and
and and what
how how would that make any difference
right
that's the right question
you're saying something got modified
okay doctor
so what
is that a modification that will matter
am i going to grow another leg
isn't that the big question
what happened when she asked the so what
question the most important question
what happened
dr simone gold cut her off
to talk about something else
they didn't want to answer the so what
question because
it might be a so what nothing
it might be
it could be that there's like a
technical change to something that's
technically your dna
but if you heard the other side
which you
didn't what would they have said
what would the other side what would the
fire say
they might say oh god you're being so
technical yeah in a technical way you
could say some dna got modified but if
you look at the details you can see that
the way it's modified is so trivial it
would be more correct to say that
nothing important happened
now i don't know if they'd say that
or anything close to it
but did you hear the other side
nope
so what credibility would you look would
you put in a study
where you haven't heard the let's say
the
you know the uh the offended party would
be pfizer right they would be the the
offended party in this because the data
goes against their best interests if you
haven't heard from them
you really haven't heard the situation
have you
just remember that you haven't heard the
other side
so they glossed over the so what
they made a legal pronouncement that in
to my non-legal mind just looks stupid
it just doesn't look like it applies at
all to me but i could be wrong
um and then scientific studies are not
credible here's another thing who paid
for the study
who paid for the study
i don't know it wasn't presented
what trust or credibility would you put
in a scientific study
that says one company in a competitive
field
that one company is is a company you
shouldn't use
who's who is the most likely
entity
that would fund a study like that
who would have a lot of interest in
putting some money into that kind of a
study
their competitors
now
um if
right the competitor
so if the competitor funded the study
would you trust it you shouldn't
right now if they don't tell you who
funded it should you trust it
you shouldn't
right not telling you who funded it is
the same as saying well don't trust it
you don't even know who's behind it
right
if you found out that china funded it
would it change your opinion
how about johnson johnson
suppose johnson johnson funded it
because they used different technology
you don't know do you
suppose it was somebody who funded it
who has a large investment in j j it's
not even j just somebody has a large
investment in it
how would you know
all right um
and then why is no other major media
covering it now you can explain that by
saying they're all they're all captured
media
by the way that's the
the phrase i'm preferring lately
the captured news
does that sound better
so fake news just turns into you know no
it's not it's not fake news so you just
argue about what's true and what's not
um if you say it's the corporate media
it's true
but it feels sort of cold and analytical
and
it doesn't really have a persuasive
punch
but if you say the captured news
the capture dues not big media not me
not mainstream media
they don't tell you enough captured news
yeah
so this is borrowed from regulatory
capture if you know that topic
regulatory capture goes like this
you have a regulated industry let's say
a phone company or the power company
the regulators eventually get owned by
the company they're regulating one way
or another over time the company with
the money
finds a way
to get people regulating them who are
more on their side than not right
so that's called captured
captured industry
so to me it seems that between the
pharma advertising and the democrat
influence and the
probably cia it looks like it
that the news most of the news is
captured
meaning that there's somebody
controlling it who is not interested in
you hearing the total truth all the time
about the fleeing media
no that's funnier
yeah
so what do you think of that the
captured the captured news of the
captured media
because captured
gets right down to what's happening
right
when you say corporate it doesn't really
describe the problem
it just gives you a vague unhappiness
about corporate corporations
if you say
kept yeah
yeah captive
capital captives not bad the captive
media as opposed to captured
i'm liking that upgrade
who else wants to go with the upgrade
captive
instead of captured which is stronger
captive
i think captive right
yeah i like captive all right so change
is made
my new my new term is captive media all
right
um
the
president biden gave out 17
presidential medals of freedom i guess
that's the highest honor a civilian can
get
the presidential medal of freedom
including one for denzel washington
and
the bigger news um this this might be
just me but
the bigger news in all this is that i've
been passed over again
um but not denzel washington
now i ask you this
i love denzel washington
like i i like every movies and i think
he makes like 60 million dollars a year
i i just checked to find out
and i think he's actually
a solid citizen as well
i mean i don't know i mean something
could come out later but he but he does
seem like a solid citizen like the the
kind of person you want to listen to you
know the kind of person who
would give you dad advice you should
actually pay attention to
you need to
i'm not going to read that
but
for all of his many qualities of which i
think denzel washington should be
complimented
he has quite a
quite a set of qualities that i like
character
etc
empathy
but i ask you this
did he do more for the country this year
than i did
seriously
i mean seriously did he do more for the
country
than i did
no
not even close
and it's not even just me
yeah i could give you six names of
people who seem to have moved the needle
but none of them would be denzel
washington now maybe he did some awesome
things you know i don't want to i don't
want to degrade his worthiness because
he probably was totally worthy
but there might be some other people who
got passed over
that's all i'm saying
the libs of tick tock account if you're
not following that on twitter
so there's a twitter account called libs
of tick tock where they take tick-tock
videos and put them on twitter and
they're the
the ones that make the people on the
left look the worst
so you should look at them as humor more
than news they're hilariously
too far
you know i say this a lot
when you argue against wokeness in like
hey everything's too woke and i don't
want to use your pronouns and all that
stuff i'm not with you on that
the reason i'm not with you on the
anti-wokeness stuff is because to me
it's just an extension of politeness
like i'm fine with people telling me
what they would feel comfortable being
called what pronouns they want it's just
hard to do
now
the fact that people are making somewhat
reasonable requests
in many cases
i'm all on board for that yeah and you
know times change if you want to use
this word or that i'm willing to update
i'm i'm happy to
um
boss me and you lost me yeah is
the the question of demanding it
is different
right
but the question of do i want to call
people by the
by the names that they would feel most
comfortable with yes i do
but
there's no good idea that isn't taken
too far
and when people look at my work you know
with dilbert
they often misinterpret what it is i'm
making fun of
and they'll say you're making fun of all
the bad things that corporations do
almost
that that's almost true it's actually a
little more subtle than that what i make
fun of is good ideas
that went too far
you'll see that throughout my work
for example i used to make
fun of something called re-engineering
it was a big buzzword in the 90s and the
idea was instead of tweaking things to
improve them in your corporation you
would you know just tear them down and
build them up from scratch
in other words re-engineer them
reimagine the whole thing instead of
just fixing them on the edges
now weirdly
that was like a new idea
in the 90s isn't that weird
that somebody had to introduce the idea
of consultants and books
there was michael hammer who did it
so they they had to introduce the idea
that maybe sometimes you should you know
start and completely reign the engineer
so was that a good idea
or a bad idea because i made fun of it
it was a good idea completely good idea
but
the corporations like they always do
took it too far
so they took a perfectly good thing and
then they took it too far and it turned
crazy and then it became bad
so the woke stuff is exactly like that
to me
it starts out as a perfectly good idea
let's treat everybody with respect
how about we talk to people the way
they'd feel comfortable being talked to
you know within reason
and then it goes to it goes all the way
to
uh if you don't use my right pronoun
you're gonna lose your job i'm like hold
on
hold on
i think that's a little too far
a little too far
now
somebody's saying you're wrong because
you're you're saying that wokeness is a
larger category than just pronouns and
that's my point as well
my point is that this stuff always
starts as
something you could defend
and then it grows and becomes this you
know horrible stupid thing so anyway
there's this uh
therapist on tick tock
uh young uh well i don't wanna
i don't wanna label him i would say
that uh it's a they
the they says
um
that uh
it's all you're gonna think i'm saying
this wrong
it's it's so outrageous that you're
gonna think you heard it wrong
the therapist is saying that the mass
shooters don't have mental illness but a
lot of the people they shoot do
that there's more chance that there are
mentally ill people in the victim groups
than in the shooter groups
and not only that but this therapist
this is somebody who does this for a
living this therapist is quite
exasperated because we all know this we
all know that
thinking that the mass shooters have
mental illness is just a distraction
from the gun issue he says
and that the real problem here is the
patriarchy
the problem is the patriarchy
it's not mental illness
it's obviously guns in the patriarchy
says this therapist on doc and there you
go
and it's funny how much of
well it's hilarious that
somebody's opinion on the left
can be used as entertainment for the
right
think about that
when you look at this you don't say to
yourself well here's a political opinion
i need to argue against do you
you just laugh at it
am i right it's literally entertainment
is you just laugh at it
so
when you get to the point where
somebody's i think it's a serious
political opinion you can't even debunk
it
it's it's beyond the point where
debunking even makes any sense you just
go
alright
okay
all right fine
okay keith
alright
here's a take on the russia ukraine
thing that i thought was worthy of
passing along from armchair warlord
on twitter
so i don't know anything about armchair
or warlord
but i'm going to tell you his or they
opinion
and he talks about
his idea now is that the russia has
basically a total lock
on winning and all they have to do is
grind it out now you've heard that
before but here's the specific to it
apparently the
ukrainian military would be quite
capable
if the russian military met it you know
military to military in a big old
confrontation
but modern militaries don't do that so
much anymore so they're standing at a
great distance
and shooting artillery at each other the
problem is the russian artillery reaches
the ukrainians and the ukrainian
artillery does not reach the russians
and it doesn't look like that's going to
change
so apparently the russians can just
you know
well let's shoot off another thousand
artillery shells
they'll shoot off a thousand artillery
shells and like
all right time for bed get up tomorrow
shoot off another thousand artillery
shuttles
now when they're done and it looks like
they're not going to run out of
artillery
there won't be anything left to the
ukrainian army and there won't be any
battle
right
that's it
so
um i said this about russian artillery
over a month ago
yeah the the thing that's
um i guess that we would add to it is
that it doesn't seem to be a counter
strategy to it
the the vietnamese strategy which i also
read about on this thread from armchair
warlord
uh the the
mies used to call it be
getting between the belt buckle and the
person
so in other words
um
in other words
if uh
if you're at a place where their
artillery can get to you but you can't
get to them you got to get closer
getting further away isn't going to help
you because then they just move toward
you
so basically the only strategy that the
ukrainians have
is basically to attack a stronger
military get closer to them so they're
their weapons worth both ways do you see
that happening i don't see that
happening
so
you know war is completely unpredictable
most of the time
and so i don't know
you know i don't know if this is the
steady state and now we can predict how
it goes it looks like it but i would
also expect the ukrainians to counter
with different kind of weaponry and
tactics and something so we'll see but i
think this is a worthy point of view
that we might already see the the end
point which is ukraine just gets ground
up and they can take as long as they
want because russia's got time
so um
is there any theories yet
uh about why shinzo abe was killed
uh does the news have an update on that
because it was such breaking news i
didn't see anything before i get on any
breaking news on that
just speculation right
uh he was based say this crazy guy yeah
who knows
right yeah maybe because of
china i don't know
it doesn't
i don't feel like china assassinates
people
in foreign lands
do you
that that feels as non-china-ish as
anything could feel
yeah and believe me i'm as anti-china as
anybody but i don't think they do things
that are that on the nose that's more of
a putin play you know putin might
just kill his adversary on foreign
ground
the cia does
somebody says maybe
all right
so apparently germany is already
rationing hot water dimming his street
lights and shutting down swimming pools
because the energy crisis is you know
sweeping the country
and how many different ways do we have
to say that trump was right about that
if you were on the left
and you saw how many times trump said
something that was just outrageous and
then it turned out to be true
wouldn't you be a little bit worried
about your stance on climate change
right
every time trump gets one right
that you that even
you know even i have to admit even at
the time when he said it i didn't make
too much note of it i wasn't quite sure
it would make a big difference you know
i thought things were stable with russia
and germany and that
i wasn't really sure it would make any
difference but he did trump did
and now i would say well he was
definitely right definitely right
and the rest of the world seems to have
been wrong on that
but when you see him do that time after
time
including running for president
how many people thought trump could win
the presidency i'm not even sure trump
knew it actually
but
when you see him get one like that right
that the smartest people were getting
wrong
what else has he gotten
right trump says the election was rigged
he doesn't have solid evidence of that
but what do you think of his instincts
see here here's the trouble
his instincts
are crazy
crazy good
his you know fact checking not so good
his command of the details of you know
topics i don't know
maybe good enough maybe not who knows
depends on the topic but his instincts
are crazy good
and his instinct is that the election
was rigged
so what would you
judge as more credible trump's instinct
which weirdly has been correct on in
times when you thought it wouldn't be
or
uh the fact that there's no evidence
that stands up
no
i would be uh uneasy if i were on the
left because the more times trump is
proven right about something that's you
know a complicated topic
the more you have to wonder if he's
right on the other one that you don't
you can't prove it one way or the other
all right how many of you think this
so-called red wave of republican
electoral victories
is really going to happen
because i think rasmussen is still
confirming there's a big gap eight point
gap at the moment
and
so the trouble is
nothing seems predictable anymore
does it
thank you for the ten dollars
um
should make a list of things trump got
right yeah
that would be interesting
um
i i'm a little bit concerned
that
i'm not worried about complacency you
know that's
that's ever everybody mentions that but
i'm a little bit concerned this will be
another surprise
and that the um
the insurrection the january 6 hoax may
not be working as well as the democrats
wanted
they have to kind of roll out another
hoax don't they
so i feel like there's a
like there's a master hoax
brewing
now it could be they thought they had
all they needed in the january 6 stuff
it could be that there's some sub hoaxes
within the january 6th thing but we know
some hoaxes are coming
because that's
that's their only play it's all they
have
well
um
here is the funniest part of all of this
now let's say things go the way most of
the pundits expect and that the
republicans you know sweep congress and
even win the white house in 2024.
do you know what the best part about
that would be
not the part where republicans are in
charge i know some of you like that
that's not the best part you know what
the best part will be
the best part will be watching the
democrats complain that the elections
were rigged because there's no way that
they could have lost that badly and fair
elections
that's actually going to happen
and they're going to do it shamelessly
as if they had not spent the prior four
years
complaining
that you shouldn't say elections are
rigged
they're going to do it right in front of
you and it won't matter that they spent
the prior year telling you it's not a
thing it will not matter
mark my words
it will not matter
that they argue the opposite for four
years won't matter
they'll just
they'll just act that like they had
never existed four years ago
so that's my prediction
all right
here
how many of you think that
i'm going to do a little straw poll here
how many think the next president will
be trump
so just say trump if you think is trump
trump
all right a lot of no's a lot of no's
interesting
all right
how many say
a way for those to go by how many say
desantis and just use his name just use
desantis or trump
desantis
now this is not necessarily who you're
backing this is who you're predicting
right predicting not backing predicting
not preferred
a lot of desantis all right
what happens if desantis
decides not to get in because trump does
let's play it through
do you think that that's a thing that if
trump uh is in the primer well yeah if
trump announces
do you think it's a thing
that desantis will stay out
most say yes right all right i would
agree with that i would say you stay out
now because he's young enough right he's
young enough he can wait another four
years
great
um
now
here's the fun part
if trump
runs but desantis does not
is anybody else going to primary trump
do you think trump will get primaried
some are saying yes some are saying no
who would be the strongest primary
challenger
strongest challenger for the primaries
somebody says tulsi
uh liz cheney
i can't tell if you're joking
josh hawley
somebody says
um
the answer is tom cotton
now i don't think christy gnome is
probably going to run
so if she did that'd be interesting but
of the people who are likely to have an
interest who is better than tom cotton
because i don't think he has any baggage
does he
somebody says you know he doesn't have
the charisma
is that going to matter for the coming
election
does the next republican candidate need
charisma
i don't think so
i don't think the next republican needs
charisma you know a lot of people might
say a little less charisma would be good
this time
am i right
a little less charisma might be exactly
what we need this time
so
here's my little uh
semi prediction it's sort of a
conditional
so conditional upon the following
desantis knock it again
don't know if that's true
trump getting in
and then tom cotton primary him do you
think do you think tom cotton could beat
trump in a primary
i see almost all knows
how about on locals almost all those on
youtube almost all knows
somebody says he supported the war in
ukraine well we'd have to look at what
that means
um i'm going to give you a
an ulterior let's say
a competing prediction
he might be able to win a primary
against trump
he might
and here's why
his his uh i believe his policies are
republican enough am i right
there's no republican who's going to say
tom cotton is not republican enough
confirm this for me please
correct he is as republican as you need
to be does he have the experience
senators generally do
so he has the experience he's republican
enough
does he make mistakes
is he a big mistake guy you know
blunders and gaffs
not so much not really
i don't think i've ever seen one
in fact i can't think of any video you
i've ever seen
in which he's talking and the ideas you
know he said something silly so we're
all joking about it
i don't think so
so if you put somebody in there who's
error free
totally republican very smart
totally qualified and he's running
against trump what are you going to do
what are you gonna do
because you do think to yourself well i
think trump has more wattage and he does
he has more wattage
but do you want it
do you want it because the wattage works
two ways right it does
break down some doors
but it also
breaks down some houses
you know like sometimes it's a little
too much
so
i think tom cotton could take trump out
because a lot of republicans are going
to say to themselves
i want to win but i don't want a repeat
of having somebody in office who's just
going to be
you know the subject of all this
controversy
i've got somebody saying pompeo
and if pompeo was in there that would be
interesting because he'd be primary
trump but
um
it would also
divide the vote right
so presumably that would help trump
if the if the not trump vote is divided
trump still sails through as the one who
has the most votes
right
and yes i will not ignore the fact that
tom cotton has a very unfortunate last
name
pompeo would hold his own debate yeah
pompeo would be good in a debate
he's a smart guy but so is so is cotton
all right i believe that if
um
tom cotton had the right
campaign help
he could take trump out
that's what i think
the there there is a situation where
that could happen
and i feel like calling it a long shot
would be
uh too far
i don't think it's a long shot i think
it's unlikely
so let me be clear about my prediction
it's unlikely
the the
the main thing that would happen would
be trump gets in trump gets the
nomination that's the most likely
scenario
but here's what you can't rule out
that when you hear tom cotton talk
you think to yourself
wait a minute is he selling me the trump
benefits without the trump
costs
how many republicans would take that
proposition
i'll give you trump-like policies but
without the trump-like problems
is it
you don't think republicans would find
that attractive
because he can say it directly
you know tom cotton could say directly
look my policies are not that different
from trump's
but with me you don't get all that
problem
what republicans going to say no to that
i mean if the proposition is given to
you that cleanly
same policies or very similar policies
a little bit more research
don't worry about the drama i'm not
going to bring any drama
republican policies without the drama
i don't know
you you give me a um you tell me
imagine this all right mental experiment
i'm walking down the street and i
randomly stop a republican voter
just randomly they say who are you going
to vote for
the voter says
give me donald trump
and i say all right
great
would you be even happier if you could
get trump's
policies
in the candidate who wouldn't be as much
trouble and maybe make you look bad as a
voter
would you prefer that
how many how many republicans could i
not convince
to change the vote to one that's better
for them as a voter because i get all
the right policies but they're not
they're not smeared
by the reputation that comes with being
a trump supporter
who would not take that deal
see i think it's entirely how it's
presented
don't you
if tom cotton just runs sort of an
independent race where he says i have
good ideas
i don't think that's enough
but if tom cotton says directly look i'm
going to give you trump policies or
trump-like policies but without all the
drama
how do you not vote for that remember he
doesn't have a weakness
you know if you're saying his weakness
is his charisma i say well that might
make him less fun
but is that why you care about now is
that your top priority when the you know
the world's at war kind of in ukraine
and
you got big issues is your is your
biggest
criteria that he's not entertaining
could be
it could be
um
i don't think anybody understands the
strategic petroleum reserves there's a
story out
that some of the oil got sold to a
chinese company that has that hunter
biden had some financial
investment in
now would you be worried about that if
our strategic petroleum reserves that's
the oil that we keep stored for an
emergency
it was released for the purpose of
increasing the supply of oil which
should have decreased the price
so that was the purpose of it
but some of it got sold to a chinese
company
now what i learned as i was
dealing with this on twitter
nobody understands the strategic
petroleum reserves
i don't
i wanted to come on here and explain it
to you and say well let me explain to
you
this is the way that works but do you
know what you're hearing in the news
you're hearing that the oil was released
what
how do you release oil was it in jail
it's not really an economic term is it
so i don't know how to evaluate it it
got released
does release meaning they gave it away
does release mean they sold it as a
discount
does release mean they sold it at spot
market prices market prices
or does released mean they sold it
only to
domestic companies or should have or
just released means it goes into the
world
i i saw before i came on a statistic
give me a check on this
do does america use use
20 million barrels a day
but the strategic reserve was going to
release 1 million barrels a day
are those numbers correct give me a fact
check
does you does the us use 20 million
20 million yeah
20 million a day
but we released an extra one which would
be 5 right
now if the if all of that happened
within a a world which was just the
united states
shouldn't a five percent increase in
supply
have something like it's not an exact
correlation but something like a five
percent decrease in the price at the
the gas station
right
um
but what if it's released into the
global economy
because i don't know how it's released
or if it's bought or sold or given away
i don't know anything about it
and the people i talked to on twitter
seemed to have pretty strong opinions
but also didn't know anything about it
so i suggested on twitter
that maybe the fed should buy the
everything in the strategic petroleum
reserves to bring down inflation
anybody on board with that the fed let's
just have the fed
buy the entire strategic petroleum
reserve to bring down inflation anybody
good with that
i don't even know what that means
it doesn't mean anything i don't i don't
even know what the fed does
i hope you heard that
i have a degree in economics
i've got an mba from a top school
i don't know what the fed does
i somehow i made it through economics
without anybody being able to explain it
to me i mean i i can repeat the
the the surface level stuff right
but there's something about it i i just
don't understand
right i understand some of its functions
but that's that's very different
from understanding
and i've tried to read up on it a number
of times
and when i read up about it i'm like
why does this not make sense does
anybody have that same experience where
you try to
educate yourself and say i keep hearing
about the fed
but i don't hear it what does it do
and then you look into it
and you don't quite understand what it
does
the other thing like that is the
strategic petroleum reserves
i don't know do we sell it give it away
do something domestically is it only for
the refineries in the united states what
happens if there's more oil than the
united states could use because of
refinery capacity do we sell it is it
spa prices or a restriction on who buys
i don't know i don't know any of that
so when i said why don't you take the
thing you don't know about the fed
and use it to buy the other thing you
don't know about
or you don't understand the strategic
petroleum reserves
and reduce inflation which is the third
thing you don't know anything about
those are three things that economists
don't understand
the fed
strategic petroleum reserves and
inflation in general
because
the experts were all confused
remember when we had uh stagflation in
the 70s or whatever it was and
then later all the experts said well
gonna get a stagflation again no we
didn't
we got inflation without the stag part
so
the thing you need to know when you see
any story about
strategic petroleum reserves
or the fed or inflation
literally nobody understands them
that's that's my opinion
now it's not a fact
it's just an opinion but i haven't seen
anybody who can explain it
i did a micro lesson that i wasn't sure
i was going to release but i'm going to
talk about it right now
i tried to learn
music
specifically playing the drums
and i got experts and looked at you know
talk to people who got the music and
here's the thing i couldn't understand
if i look at drum music written on a you
know a music sheet
and then i go to play it
it doesn't sound good if i play it
exactly like the music is written
it doesn't really sound like anything
you'd want to listen to
and and likewise if you took a drum
machine
and you just programmed it to play the
notes exactly as written you wouldn't
want to hear it
because it wouldn't have any soul you
know wouldn't have any
right
so when somebody teaches me uh to play
the drums
and i play it exactly as is written and
exactly as taught but it doesn't sound
good
i say why doesn't it sound good
you know why is this famous drummer
sounding good i'm playing the same notes
off the same sheet why does mine not
sound good and the answer is
that the the artist is actually adding
something
right so the artist is modifying the
notes in small ways little emphasis
maybe a little
little space that you know they make up
for by compressing the next one
something like that whatever it is
so here's the question i asked
well
if the good drummers are doing that
can't you just listen to them and then
rewrite the music so that a new drummer
could look at how the other person
played it in a pleasing way and then
just imitate it so why couldn't my
computer
simply listen to keith moon or some
other famous drummer
and just say oh
this drummer is not playing it the way
it shows on the sheet
they're they're consistently making this
kind of change which would be easy to
program or they're somewhat randomly
adding
things to it that your ear is picking up
subtly but a computer can randomly add
things to
so there's no reason that your computer
can't make this music better than an
artist except one reason
do you know what that is
that the people who do it for a living
the artists
don't know what they're doing
that's the only way any of this makes
sense and the way you can confirm that
is by talking to them
let me let me give you my impression
of a very good artist who really knows
music
explaining to scott
why his drumming doesn't sound good why
can't i just put this in a computer and
it would sound great and the artist says
no no it's not going to have the soul
you know it's not going to happen
you know what i'm talking about because
you know if the if the computer does it
it's just going to be to to to
to to to to
to nobody wants to hear that but if a
human does it it's going to be
do you see
and then i say
no
no i don't see
because what you're describing
if you understand it
would be something you could write on
this piece of paper
you say look don't play it the way it's
written normally make sure this is
modified a little this modified now do
that and watch how good it sounds
and i'd say oh
okay so that's a little modification
i'll do that modification i'll do it
now that would work
but that will never happen
instead
instead of saying okay modify your sheet
music so it's more like what they
actually play that sounds good do you
know what the artist will say
oh
no you just got to get you got a little
put a little
like got a little stank into it
the experts
don't know why the thing they're doing
works they really don't
economists don't know
why happens
but it's their job to act like it
so you get a lot you get a lot of
experts
explaining to you to you things and you
think it's your problem don't you
right
do you know what i don't think this will
be the cockiest thing i've ever said and
i've said some cocky things
this will be the cockiest thing you've
ever heard but
it's my
it's also
my advice to you
right so i'm going to say something
about myself but put yourself in the
position because it's about you too
the reason i can't understand the fed
is not my fault
it's not
it's because the people whose job it is
to understand it don't understand it if
they did
they could explain it to you
if they did
they could explain it to you
when the experts can't explain something
to you it's not always because you're
dumb
twenty percent of the time it is
eighty percent of the time is because
they don't understand it
and when they do
they can understand it well let me give
you another example
when i started writing humor
i naturally wondered if there's some way
to do it better is there a formula to
how do you know something's funny
and it didn't exist and if you asked
anybody who wrote humor for a living
and you said all right
what makes it funny and they say well
surprise or it's you know tragedy
happening to somebody else and those
would be in there but if that's all you
knew couldn't you reproduce it
could you take that and then go write
some humor nope
and it's the reason is that the people
who made humor didn't know how they did
it
they didn't understand their own area of
expertise
but
because i don't come from sort of an
artistic background i come from more of
an engineering mindset i'm not an
engineer but you know i spend so much
time with them you pick up the mindset
when i started doing humor
i started saying well there's got to be
some formula underlying all this
and then i discovered it
it's the two of six formula
that if you write uh what you want to be
a joke and use two of these six
dimensions
it's funny
so that's
that's an example of me as an expert
actually understanding my field
because i can explain it to you in a
formula that you can completely
understand i'll do it right now
you have to use two of these six things
and help me out if i forget two of my
own things it's got to be acute clever
uh absurd recognizable
mean or naughty
all right now you understand what all
those words mean you would know what a
cruel situation looked like you would
know what an absurd situation looked
like so there's no definition that
really needs to be
given there
and all you do is follow that rule
if you use two of those dimensions in
your joke
people will laugh at it
it actually is a formula
now musicians can't do what i just did
tell you how to do it you know with some
detail that you could just put into an
objective form
and when people can't put it that simply
they don't understand their field
right
okay
somebody says the good ones can yeah
everything has an exception and by the
way um
there is nothing more annoying than
dealing with what i call the the
absolute
people on twitter
so if i say
inflation's gone up
somebody's gonna say
that's not true
the price of my whatever went down
yesterday
all right and then and then i want to
say
but mostly it went up
right i'm not really talking about every
single situation i'm generally talking
so the other day when i'm saying that i
thought genetics were far more important
than parenting
a lot of people said to me
why do you say parenting is completely
useless
and i say no
i'd say parenting is maybe 10 to 20 of
the outcome
and
um genetics is probably you know 80 or
90.
and then people say to me
but why are you saying that genetics is
everything and i say
i don't know did you just listen to the
last 10 seconds
i just said it's 90
and then people say well then you're
saying it's worthless to try to have
good parents and i say
are you listening to any of this
if you could improve uh you know a 10
percent likelihood of outcomes for your
children you'd be all over that
10 is a lot
when you're talking about the life of
your children
so of course you want the best parents
of course you want the best advice the
best techniques because it is going to
affect 10 to 20
but for some reason
i couldn't get that across
isn't that interesting that that concept
i could not explain and i don't know why
but
you consistently see it across all
topics
people will
interpret what you said as an absolute
do you know why they will do that
why will people interpret what you
clearly don't mean to be an absolute
they'll interpret it as absolute to
debunk it why do they do that it's
cognitive dissonance right cognitive
dissonance says i know i was right
but i don't have a reason
so my brain is going to create one that
doesn't make any sense
and then i'm going to act like it made
sense that's what cognitive dissonance
is so if i say to you
it's
90 genetic
but you've spent your whole life
believing oh it's 90 parenting
even if i make my case and even if it's
well made which i think it is
what you should say
is you should hear me saying
it's a hundred percent genetic which
i've never said
and then you'll debate you'll you'll
debunk the 100 part
not what i said
so when you hear the absolutists weigh
in
are you saying
so and i got this exactly so you're
saying every single
no
no
of course not
um
anything else happening
um
so people couldn't tell it was a joke
when i said the fed should buy the
strategic petroleum reserves literally
it doesn't make any sense it's just
random economic terms and slapped
together
but
we'll have to figure out what release
means when we release the strategic
reserves
do we buy it or what
um
germany is making it illegal to change
thermostats
the fed has been captured
release means sell gary says
sell it to whom
and at what price
now
here's what i do know about things does
somebody have a number of how many
barrels of oil are used per day by the
entire world
does somebody give that number how many
barrels of oil are used not produced are
used
actually it's probably going to be
exactly the same as produced right
is that right
roughly speaking we would the world
would end up using about the same as
they produce every day
because it's not like the world is
piling it up it's
it's selling it as it makes it right
um
somebody says a hundred million barrels
a day 88 million so if the united states
was 20 that sounds about right
the u.s is about 20 percent of the oil
use
let's say that's right
so if if biden released 1 million
to the global world
1 million barrels per day but it uses
100 there should be a one percent
difference
ish it's not it's not one for one but
but somewhere in that neighborhood would
be the most it could have affected the
price of the pump right
like it couldn't be a 10
improvement if there's only a one
percent change in supply
uh
uh when they release u.s code it may
make you attractive all right so release
means sell but we still don't know sell
to whom
and at what price
and that's those big
now here's another complaint i have
people said that we shouldn't use these
strategic petroleum reserves unless it's
an emergency
to which i say
isn't this an emergency
if if
now there's two things happening one is
one is that it doesn't work
can we all agree on that
increasing the the supply of oil by one
percent
globally
it doesn't make it shouldn't make any
difference right one percent
um
so if we agree it doesn't work
i want to back up to a more of a
philosophical question on a practical
level it just doesn't work but on a
philosophical level
isn't an economic
crisis um a defensive problem
see i think a lot of people
think that military and economy are two
different categories but it's only
because we choose to talk about them
that way
in reality they're so merged
you know if you look at
ukraine and russia
we're talking as much about their
economic ability to wage war as their
physical ability
do they have the money to keep
resupplying and staying in business
so
if
if
you had a situation
where using the strategic oil reserves
was going to benefit only your economy
but it actually made a difference i
would say that's an emergency and i
would i would say that was be a an
appropriate use of an emergency fund
to
to put off a recession because a
recession can really damage your ability
to
fund your military and rebuild it and
keep it modern
and all that
however the reality of this situation is
it doesn't look like it'd make any real
difference in the real world
in which case
it's just a political signaling
um
and if we believe uh here's here's the
best economic analysis i've seen today
from jersey
cy a twitter user
now he's he's weighing in on the
question of releasing the strategic
petroleum reserves if that lowers gas
prices and it works
if that works
this question makes sense and jersey cys
would quote release the hounds make the
price of dogs go down
i think it would i think it would
because if you release the hounds there
would be more hounds on the market
and then the average price per hound
should go down so yes
release the hounds
to lower the cost of hounds
thank you for that joke that's pretty
good
all right
uh dutch farmers yes the dutch farmers
are rebelling quite effectively it looks
like
now let me ask you this
where's that food shortage
now you say to yourself oh that's
working its way through the system we're
not seeing it yet but
we sure will
really
now i get that there's a lag i get that
and that we should not have seen it yet
do you all agree
but here's what we should have seen
a lot more reporting
and and i feel as if
the food shortage might be in a mirage
what do you think
i think i've got a bet against it
yeah i guess the cost of groceries is
already going up but that's with
everything else going up
we do know that you know transportation
every every part of farming is going to
be more expensive because of energy
okay
do you think africa is going to run out
of food
i feel like they just might run out of
grain and that
they'll just be other replacements
tulips are up 300 percent
all right yeah the fertilizer shortage
is probably the biggest deal that we
have and we don't talk about it too much
all right well keep an eye on that uh
here's the thing is that i feel like the
adams law of slow-moving disasters is
going to take care of the food shortage
because the market
you know saw way in advance that it
needed other alternatives so i think
anybody who could have grown an
alternative
or planted an extra field
where they where they can
probably did
remember when uh do we still do this do
we still pay farmers to not plant
can somebody give me a fact check
and and is that a big deal
could the government just say
uh change their minds you're gonna have
to plant those fields
and wouldn't that be a one-season
problem and couldn't we probably
get by for one season
um
uh don over on uh youtube has a comment
or i'd like to weigh in on this
um talk about the dutch farmers and don
wants you to know that the dutch blondes
are so hot though
they're so hot it's true
the dutch blondes so hot
and i think that's a valuable
contribution
to the conversation
and
ai is making its own patents oh
yeah what happens when the ai applies
for a patent
yeah i saw the ar-15 commercial i don't
know i wasn't too interested in it
i got it you had a kkk head on and
so the the cern ai
is that why you keep saying cern to me
or are you talking about it
destroying the planet
oh
the cern questions are all about ai all
right
the ai will immediately patent itself
oh concern is a conspiracy theory
involving timeline shifts
is that the story
is the story that cern did something
that that changed the
the timeline
[Laughter]
well if you told me this earlier i would
have looked into it
what if the ufos are actually uh
us from the future
you ever think about that
one explanation for ufos is that it's
just us
it's just us from the future and the
reason that you don't get a good picture
of it and you know they don't land and
introduce themselves is that they can't
change the the timeline
because we know we don't want to change
our own past
so we make sure that when we go back to
it we stay in the ship and the ship can
observe things
and maybe sometimes it gets caught but
nobody knows what it is so it doesn't
change our timeline
here's another possibility
if you live in a simulation
it could be that these ufos are just
really the
the hosts of the simulation you know
whoever built it it may be just uh their
mechanism for getting inside and and
looking at things
that's all you're seeing
it's the warden
all right yeah maybe
what are the chances we have a future we
don't want to change well that's true
we want it
uh yeah it's sort of a rick and morty
program all right
cern is a programmer in the simulation
i don't think they're military drones
because the they're turning so quickly
thing that's why i think it's either a
software or an illusion or it's us from
the future or some damn thing
thank you for this wonderful message
