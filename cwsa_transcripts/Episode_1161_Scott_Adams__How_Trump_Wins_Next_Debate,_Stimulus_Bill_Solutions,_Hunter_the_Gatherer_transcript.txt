yes
uh i hope you're all done uh tubing
and you're ready for coffee with scott
adams best part of the day
well okay that first part was pretty
cool too but
after that after you're done tubing
this is the best part of the day and
what do you need to maximize the best
part of the day
well you might need a cup or a mug or a
glass of tank or towels to style a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better except
my haircut it's called the simultaneous
hip
and it happens right now go
yup just as good as i hoped
never disappoints well in my defense
i do look a little shaggy today i have
to admit
but it's because christina cuts my hair
just because it's way more fun than
going to a barber
and she is uh flying her
flying an airplane off to another state
today
as part of getting her pilot's license
so this will be her first
solo cross state flight
and she's probably in the air right
about now
so wish her luck and if you see me with
a haircut it either means i tried to cut
it myself or she came back
let's talk about biden's health
you may have noticed if you follow ali
alexander
that he noticed that uh there were some
tells that biden has that suggests maybe
parkinson's is a problem but
i read ali's text and i say to myself
hey
ali alexander you're no medical doctor
i'm not going to be repeating these
slanderous
potential medical claims from somebody
who's not a medical doctor but then
but then in the twist i didn't see
coming an actual medical doctor
and not just any medical doctor dr
zev zelenko tweeted essentially the same
stuff
now i don't know if he saw ali's tweets
i'm thinking he might have but this is
what uh
dr zelenko and by the way if you
recognize the name
he would be the same doctor who was
promoting hydroxychloroquine
so you can you can put that in your
your box where you where you try to
judge his credibility
and here's what the doctor says and
again
uh you all know that you should not be
diagnosing people
from a distance no doctor should be
saying that somebody has a specific
health problem
if it's not their patient so we all know
that
the warnings right i don't have to go
over that and
and we all need to give it a great
assault right but here's what dr zelenko
tweeted he said biden has hand tremor
which i've seen on video it looks like a
hand tremor to me
i can't imagine there might be several
reasons for that but
anyway so biden has a hand trimmer
reduced
facial expression botox
handwriting changes he's old
slow shuffling gait he's old
and cognitive changes we can all see
those but
you know he's old and then
dr zlenko says he most likely has
parkinson's disease
he's being used as an avatar who is
really running for president
elder abuse so this is coming from
a doctor now
i don't think we can conclude that just
because
one doctor tweeted about biden
that he has parkinson's so i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna say that's true but here's
my
my take on it he does disappear for long
periods of time and it's really hard to
explain that
if the if the campaign thinks he's
capable of performing
so you have to assume that the campaign
does not believe he's capable of
performing
on a day-to-day basis obviously if he
were capable
he'd be out there i don't see i don't
see any exception to that
um but i would have to say that biden
has impressed me
so far in terms of at least looking
healthy
when he shows up for a debate or one of
these
uh stump speeches he looks he looks
completely healthy doesn't he
the only trouble is when he's trying to
answer a question
or go off the script a little bit and i
even said that his
uh stump speech looks
kind of perfect you know i was listening
to his
his uh kind of standard thing he says
about trump now when he's giving his
speeches
it's super visual he's got he's got a
really good um
let's say theatrical read
to his own material so he shows emotion
he shows empathy he shows you know
i know certainty shows commitment
you know his voice is really good from
an actor or political perspective
and i don't think it was even a month
ago i feel as if
biden's act if you will the one he's
crafted into this neat little package he
always presents
because he always says the same things
right when he talks about the
fine people hoax you know he says it's
real
but he says just imagine them folks
close your eyes
the veins bulging from their neck now
you've heard it a lot of times
but it's very visual and if you listen
to his whole
stump speech just just appreciate
how well he has he has honed it and
crafted it
obviously with lots of expert help until
it's really tight
it's really tight he hits all the notes
very visual
good emotion but here's the problem
and it might be at least it might be at
least part of why we don't see much of
him
i don't think he can do anything else
because when you see him nail that can
to speech
he's reading it and when he does have to
do something without reading it
it's usually a little memorized segment
from the canned speech
what would happen if every single time
you saw biden
he said exactly the same thing because
that's what's happening
it's exactly the same and that also
suggests maybe some mental impairment
or a little mental risk that we don't
see with trump
trump goes out there and he's got he's
got his written thing he can read from
and he does
go to it but he's mostly doing stand-up
comedy
live without a net five days a week or
something
or whatever he's doing uh or how many is
he doing like five rallies a day or
something crazy
toward the end of the election cycle
um so i don't think there's any there's
any comparison to their mental
acuity one can go out there and riff all
day long
take the toughest questions from 60
minutes we'll talk about that
and everybody else and biden can't
and that's got to be pretty obvious to
everybody
by the way i love i love trump's
strategy
of going just nuts on
rallies and public events the last
several days before the election
and here's why that's so brilliant
number one it might work
you know that extra work could be the
difference
but suppose it isn't it's still a great
idea
because one of two things will happen
either he will win
and if he wins what will he be able to
say
about his win he'll be able to say he
outworked
biden right and and everybody will agree
because they'll say well biden's hiding
trump is not even just doing a normal
schedule he ramped it up to
schedule times five and he's really
really killing it in these last weeks
you're gonna see the energy the
commitment the you know the drive the
hard work
a lot of stuff you like now if he wins
he'll always be able to say
that's why i outworked him that that is
the best
if you win in any competition
if you have if you have the ability
afterwards to say
i outworked him oh that's just the best
because that just that's everything good
about people
is in that one statement i outwork to my
competitor
that's what you like to hear now suppose
he loses
suppose trump loses still
exactly the right strategy because he
can leave the field saying i left it all
in the field
and you would look at it and you say
yeah yeah i would say
certainly if you're looking at those
closing weeks he left it all on the
field
you know and you have to respect that
and he would leave with the best
first term uh of any president i think
i you know i would agree with heraldo
who said that
so he's got a good strategy of going
hard and it's going to make that
uh comparison to biden even more stark
and of course the way your brain is
organized it only understands things
in comparison so the more anemic
biden is and the more he hides the more
beneficial it is for trump to
to ramp it up to 10 because then you
that that distance between them is
increased
and we only understand our world by
difference
by comparison so he's just ramping up
that comparison like crazy
very good strategy all right um
let me take a little detour here to give
you some investment
advice most of you might not need this
but some of you might be thinking i
wouldn't mind investing someday
if i had a little extra money so here's
some investment advice
now i don't give a specific investment
advice in terms of a company to buy
so i'm going to give you generic advice
but i'll mention some companies
just as examples and some of them are
ones that i've bought
actually everything that i mentioned
next will be
will be a company that i own some stock
in so that's full disclosure
so i'm not a financial advisor
and i'm not a good investor so so did
you hear that
i'm not a good investor
if you look at my lifetime track record
but there are some things that are just
generally true about investing
that you need to get right and recently
i'd say i'm getting those things right
so number one you should diversify you
should not buy one stock
or just a few stocks anybody who buys
one stock
or just a few is putting too much risk
in a few companies
and even if they're great companies you
don't know that they're going to be
around forever
so diversify is number one if you get
that right you're in good shape
with stocks number two i
learned this tip from a billionaire
a billionaire said i only invest in
monopolies
and i said what because there's no such
thing as a monopoly right
if we had a monopoly it would get broken
up by the government
because it's not legal to be a monopoly
so how can you say you only invest in
monopolies
when they don't even exist and then he
said
but we don't call them monopolies
we call it the network effect what has
the network
effect uh if you're trying to guess what
billionaire
you won't be able to do it so don't
assume that you can guess who it was
um and here's what the network effect is
it means that if a bunch of people are
using something
you can't leave it because all of your
friends are with the other thing
facebook is the perfect example i don't
own stock in facebook by the way
except within funds and
if if you wanted to leave facebook you
could
i mean you could go to some other
facebook competitor but all your friends
and family are on facebook
so you don't it's just too hard um
so the types of companies that i would
say fit into the category where
you could leave them they do have
competition
but it would be so hard that you're not
going to do it
and here here's the list of companies
that fit that
amazon is anybody really going to
compete with amazon
because once you got your one click
going on
you're kind of stuck with amazon aren't
you so it's not
technically a monopoly but
for all practical purposes it's not
going anywhere
apple apple has competition the entire
android universe right
but once you're in that apple ecosystem
it's almost impossible to leave and i've
tried
i've tried a few times to say ah in the
past i've said i'm going to get rid of
this apple stuff
because i was mad at some product or
something you can't
it's almost impossible because their
their products all work together so well
that once you get in their universe it's
just easier to have all of their stuff
and make it all work together uh
snapchat if you saw the news today
snapchat
is going nuts uh if you have young kids
in your life
any teenagers you know you know that
snapchat
isn't going anywhere and in fact it
might pick up some of the tick tock
business
because they cloned some of that so
snapchat again
how hard would it be for somebody to
compete with snapchat
easily there's nothing that they built
they can't be built by somebody else
but the kids are on snapchat and they're
not going anywhere
talk talk to a talk to a 14 year old
and say hey do you use snapchat the
answer is yes
if they're 14 they're using snapchat and
would you be willing to get off of
snapchat nope
all of their friends are on snapchat
they can't leave
it's a monopoly for all practical
purposes for
a certain age group and that's the age
group you want to capture
microsoft same thing you can leave
microsoft
but they have such dominance in so many
categories
it's hard to imagine twitter twitter is
another
situation yes there are several other
twitter competitors have you tried any
it's
it's like it's like the most boring
thing it's like
eating a piece of bread with nothing on
it
because there's not enough people there
and all the people that you fight with
and you know
the excitement the the retweets all of
the energy
is on twitter you could leave but you're
not gonna
and then tesla is the most interesting
one on the list you could argue this one
but um i've heard tesla described as an
uh as a green energy play that it's not
really a car company
it's a company that knows how to store
and manipulate energy so it's going to
have its solar
panels it's going to have batteries it's
going to have automobiles
at some point it's really just an energy
company
and probably a dominant one and if to
the extent that their products work
together you'll be stuck
all right so diversify but if you had to
buy an individual company make sure that
it's a monopoly
meaning network effect and then here's
the third tip
all of those companies i mentioned all
over priced
meaning it's too late you know didn't
you want to get into these companies
but now they're they're sky high prices
they've already gone up twice
it's too late so here's the here's the
third tip
when there's a major downturn that's
when to get in
so when we had the coronavirus hit i
took all of my cash that i had available
and i dumped it into these uh these
companies that i mentioned
um the ones i didn't already own and
the play was that if the entire world
fell apart
which is what coronavirus sort of
threatened just everything's going to
fall apart
it doesn't matter what stock you own
doesn't matter
because the whole world fell apart if it
doesn't fall apart
there are some stocks that are going to
come back faster
and digital ones were obvious amazon was
obvious because of the
you know the social distancing etc so
wait for a downturn
and uh don't buy only one of those
companies if you're gonna buy any of
these
network effect companies buy several of
them so you've got a little bit of a
diversification all right that's more
than you wanted here
um i heard that kaepernick wants to
abolish police
and prisons does that sound crazy
kaepernick wants to actually get rid of
the police and get rid of prisons how
would you replace them
like what kind of a system would you
have unlike most of you
i think it might be possible but you
would really have to change things
and i would like to suggest just a few
ways that you could go about that reason
you know here's one way you could remove
the reasons for crime
right now you couldn't do it in the
inner city it's probably too hard to
just turn the inner city into a
no police zone but suppose you were to
start from scratch
just pick some place and say all right
here's the place we're going to
experiment
it doesn't have too many problems so you
know it's like a blank field
could you create a situation where
people just didn't have a reason to
commit any crimes
because why do you commit a crime in the
first place well you need food or you
need
resources or something what if you could
get food
you could get resources you didn't have
to steal
so you you might create a situation
where the reason to have crime
is much reduced it's hard to do but you
can imagine it
at least you can get close to it
or you could have a surveillance state
where
you could do a crime but you would get
caught 100
of the time so imagine if you had a
location that had that dna technology
that othram uses
where if you did a crime and they got
your dna
they're gonna catch you if you knew
you knew it with no doubt that if you
did any kind of violent crime or sex
crime
you're gonna leave some dna and you're a
hundred percent gonna get caught
that would reduce crime if you knew you
were gonna get caught
um and let's say there was facial
recognition and video everywhere
now you might not want to live in that
place i could see that
but it is a it is a system that would
reduce crime
and here is the uh the ultimate
move that trump could make to own this
category
here's what you don't want to do you
don't want to just
agree with kaepernick because your base
wouldn't like it
right so trump can't say you know that's
a good idea
i think we should get rid of cops and
and get rid of prisons
you know that can't happen and if there
are people who like this idea
and apparently there are a lot of people
who want some alternative to
the police prison state here's what
trump could do and i'm not suggesting
he'll do it
this is more along the lines of giving
you a persuasion
lesson here's what trump could do it's
called the high ground
maneuver you've heard of it and it goes
like this
and before i say it let's see if you can
hit it on your own
what could trump say about the idea of
getting rid of police and prisons
that would be the high ground where he
could sort of
leapfrog it into a a higher level of
thinking
that even the people who agree with
kaepernick would have to join him at the
higher level
that's the key to the high ground it's
not a high ground maneuver
unless the moment everybody sees it they
go okay we gotta go to that
we gotta take that opinion because it's
obviously a higher opinion than our own
here it is
i don't know if that's a good idea to
get rid of police
and prisons but we should test it
somewhere
let's see what happens you see that
that's the high ground now trump is
never going to
suggest that i don't think there's any
chance but if he did
it would completely remove the issue
because he
would be the one who had the most
aggressive idea
because it's one thing to say i'd like
to world with no police and no prisons
but that's just sort of an idea trump
could actually go ahead of that
and be more aggressive and say you know
people have some ideas how do we know if
they'll work
can't know until you test it let's find
a place
ideally not an inner city where they
have too many problems they just need
more police
but if you could find a place that
doesn't already have a lot of problems
let's see if you could build something
let's let's test it small
see what happens the moment he said that
he's more aggressive than the left is on
their biggest issue
and he wouldn't have to do a thing
because it's not like he's the one who's
promising to make the test
he's just saying let's test it why are
we arguing about it when we can just
test it
and we don't know which of these ideas
will work let's
let's take a look test is small
all right let me give you my wildest
conspiracy theory are you ready
now if you're new to my periscopes
anytime i go full alex jones
i like to tell you that's what i'm doing
so that you can put it in the proper
context
as in don't take it too seriously
but see if you can learn something from
the
topic okay it goes like this
someday in our future if it hasn't
already happened
that's the conspiracy part someday we
are guaranteed to live in a future
in which decisions will be made about
society
and politics and policies and all that
and those decisions will be made by
artificial intelligence
how will you be able to identify a
decision made by
human beings versus a decision made by
artificial intelligence
as soon as the decision is made and you
hear that decision is made
how would you identify one that's oh
that's that comes from machines
and how would you know the one that came
from humans
now your first instinct might be well
it's not artificial intelligence unless
i can't tell the difference you know i
can't if i can't tell the difference
that's artificial intelligence but i
would argue that there might be
some ways to tell and i'm going to use
as my example
you saw that brennan and clapper trotted
out the
repeat story about the biden
hunter biden's laptop maybe being
russian disinformation
now they didn't say they have evidence
it is they just said
it has all the earmarks of a classic
russian disinformation plot now when you
heard that didn't you say to yourself
um why are they using exactly the same
discredited idea the russia collusion
hoax
that these exact same people including
schiff who
you know took the lie forward so you've
got schiff
brendan and clapper the three least
credible people on the entire planet
earth their credibility has been
destroyed
by the the whole russia collusion hoax
these are the most clownish non-credible
people in the world
and on top of them being the most
clownish and non-credible people in the
world
they use the same lie the very same lie
that they had just used now
what would a machine decision look like
compared to a human decision in this
very example
if humans made the example it i'm sorry
if humans
had decided on that russia strategy with
the laptops
do you think they would have because it
makes the main players look like idiots
it makes brennan clapper and schiff look
like total morons
or and liars would those three people
have said you know i got an idea
let's just try the same play again
because that strategy doesn't take into
account
the egos of the humans
that sounds like something a machine
decided
because a machine doesn't care about
your ego
but it does care about what works and is
it possible that the machine
could have determined something that
humans wouldn't
know which is even though it's a repeat
and even though it's the same characters
involved
that it would work that it might
actually be the best play
you know your your common sense from
let's say you're a trump supporter
from your perspective as a trump
supporter it just looks
bashy crazy it looks like literally the
dumbest thing you could ever do
you same same bunch of liars with the
same lie
are you kidding me you couldn't come up
with a new lie
so that's why it doesn't sound like a
human decision
it sounds like the ai said if you do
this
you're going to be able to move the the
new cycle the way you want to
convince people the way you want to and
i could imagine that the
that you know the brennan clapper shifts
say you know
i don't like this it's going to make me
look stupid
but if the ai says this is our best
strategy i still want to win
so i'm going to do it so that would be
the tell
now can i tell you that a machine made
that decision
to trot out the russia collusion thing i
can't
right because the other the other
possibility
is quite possible which is that the
democrats are so cynical
and accurate in other words they're not
wrong about this
that their enough of their base believes
russia collusion actually happened
and they have such a a stranglehold on
the news
that they can simply say the same thing
happened as happened before
and their base thinks it happened before
even though at least the russia
collusion part didn't
now the part that did happen before of
course is that russia is always you know
meddling with stuff
so that part's true but they could have
just said
this will work because the voters are
that stupid and uninformed
but all i'm suggesting is that if you
see a strategy that looks
crazy to you and it doesn't take into
account the human
egos that wouldn't have made a decision
like you're seeing
some day maybe not this example this
this might have been just a human
decision
but someday that's what it's going to
look like it's going to look like
decisions that no human would have made
because you look at it and you say i
wouldn't have made that decision
it would have been too embarrassing
computer doesn't care all right let's
talk about hunter and his
laptop um
as i tweeted and i i don't know if
anybody thought of this first
but uh i didn't see anybody else claim
credit for it but i said hunter
was a gatherer and he was gathering a
lot of stuff
not all of it good there's a report
today that
rudy giuliani turned over the laptop to
the fbi
because he found some potentially
allegedly child porn on there
and some inappropriate text messages now
the part that they didn't report
and this is a scoop you haven't heard
this anywhere
so this will be the first time you hear
this this is why
you listen to coffee with scott adams
because i have the scoops
all right so those inappropriate text
messages
that were on hunter biden's laptop what
hunter didn't know
is that the entire time he was actually
texting with putin
that's how good putin is he was
pretending to be an underage girl and
texting with hunter biden
no that didn't happen
but if you were if you were a democrat
you might have believed it
all right so what do you think do you
think it's true
that there is child porn on hunter
biden's computer
i would give you this caution you
probably are not going to hear a
confirmation one way or the other
because i don't know that the ibm
the ibm i don't know that the fbi
would tell the public what's on the
laptop if it wasn't relevant to
you know some i don't know i don't know
any situation that they would tell you
the details of what's on the
on the laptop before election day so
if you were going to make a claim
against a competitor or a competitor's
family
this is a really good one because it's
the most
it's the most toxic allegation you could
make
you know what would be more than that
murder i suppose but it's the most toxic
allegation
and because of the timing i don't
believe that the
biden camp will have any ability to
refute it
so it's kind of diabolical because
if this is not true
it's the dirtiest trick of all dirty
tricks
right and we don't know if it's true and
i'm gonna try to
maintain a little bit of
let's see i don't know if it's
credibility or
lack of bias to the extent that that's
possible
if this had happened in the other
direction
if some kind of a claim like this had
happened
against your candidate would you believe
it was true
you know if something like this had
happened to trump or trump's family
would you automatically think oh yeah
those pictures are on there
no you wouldn't no you wouldn't the
first thing you think is
if i don't see them with my own eyes i'm
not going to believe they're there
so when i see this well
you know it's not my job to defend the
bidens
i feel like there's a standard we should
all appreciate
and that standard is if somebody gets
accused of something
this bad child porn
if you get accused of something that bad
you better show the goods
all right you'd better have some pretty
solid proof of that
or i'm not just gonna accept it
now um i think also to be fair the child
is not
the father so you wouldn't necessarily
say you wouldn't vote for biden even if
you believe this to be true
and i think you got to put a really big
question mark on the truth of this one
if i had to bet i'd bet against it
actually
you know slightly i'd say 60 40 it's not
true
but
it's devastating because the problem is
you don't want
you don't want a president's family to
be blackmailable
and this is the ultimate blackmailable
kit hunter biden
is the most black available human being
who has ever walked the face of the
earth
is there any is there any vice
that a hunter has not been accused of
at least i mean this is the only one
that i haven't seen evidence of
but the other stuff there's evidence you
know the the cocaine use the shady
behavior
the you know the whatever
so how do you and i don't know if uh
if trump will go right at this because
it is
a blackmail risk now compare that to the
trump
family did you think that we would get
to the end of a
four-year cycle of the entire trump
family being
examined in every way they can be
examined every whistleblower every
you know every rock turned over and that
as
of today here's here's here's the
biggest complaint
they found about the president so far
that we didn't already know before the
election let's say
uh is that he's got some smallish
uh bank account in china and that he
paid some taxes to china
several years ago when he was looking
for some licensing deals over there
that's it now nobody is suggesting
that there's anything improper about
having a chinese bank account
if you're an international company
that's not unusual
and nobody is suggesting that paying
taxes in a company that you're
in a country you're doing business is
inappropriate
and it wasn't very much money in the
first place and
that's it that's it after four years of
digging
the best you can come up with is that
the president has a
legal bank account and legally paid
taxes in another country
that's all you got and this hunter biden
thing is a target rich environment so i
don't think you can compare them
on blackmail risk it's pretty pretty
clear
um when biden was i guess
only once maybe reporters have got close
enough to ask him
about the laptop stuff and he's answered
and says it's a smear campaign if
anybody tells you
if if you if you accuse somebody of
something
if you accuse somebody of something and
they say it's a smear campaign what do
you assume about the allegation
that is true because if somebody says
did you murder somebody
do you say no i didn't murder anybody
are you kidding
or do you say that's a smear campaign
one of those two things sounds
potentially true at least
and the other one doesn't because if you
say no i didn't
commit that crime could be true might be
a lie but it could be true
but if you say it's a smear campaign you
just said it's true
i mean you might as well just say no
it's true totally true
so biden is not handling that well and
that's part of the reason they're hiding
him from the public for days i think
and so he's got a
he's got a tough one on that we'll talk
about the debate in a minute i'll
give some debate strategies
all right what about the stimulus bill
so i guess the democrats and the
republicans can't agree the democrats
want a
a big bill that has some extra goodies
for democratic things
the republicans want a smaller bill
where people just get
get some money the president has
suggested that he wants the higher
amount but he's not even going to get
republicans to sign on so what do you do
here is my strategy and what i would do
on the stimulus bill
if i were president trump i would pick a
bigger number than the democrats
and a bigger number than the republicans
and i would say
this the part you all agree on is you
know this
base part of cash to send out for the
stimulus
so that'll be in there so republicans
are happy democrats are happy with just
this part of the bill that people seem
to agree will send out some cash
on top of that is the pelosi requests
that are kind of poison pills
these are things that they want to do
that the republicans don't think should
be part of this bill because they're the
sort of all this extra stuff and
things for for illegal immigrants etc
what trump could do is say i want not
only as much as
nancy pelosi wants but i want twice as
much
as that extra part she wants so i want
all of the stuff everybody agrees with
and i want all of the money that pelosi
wants
and then i want to double that part
here's why
and then you say to the states spend it
the way you want to
that's it that's the idea you take the
biggest amount
because nobody can argue against the
biggest amount
you need to dwarf nancy pelosi's number
and say look i don't agree with the way
you want to spend it
but can you agree with this let's give
it to the states the whole bunch
just give the whole bunch to the states
and let them spend it the way they want
to
because there's no such thing as too
much because we're in this weird
situation
where the risk of doing too little is
catastrophic
the risk of doing too much is just
uncomfortable
there's no competition between which way
to go and only
trump could do that
now you say which states here's here's
another modification
suppose one of the problems that the
republicans have is that it's some blue
states
that we're going to get most of the
money which seems likely right
probably it was going to go mostly to
blue states so you say this
what were you planning to give to those
blue states nancy pelosi
and what would that work out per person
and then you just say let's
let's figure it out per person and you
just figure out each state gets a per
person amount not that you give a check
per person
but that's the amount you give to the
state and they can decide how much
actually goes to people
and how much goes to anything else that
they want so
that's where i would go i would go
bigger than pelosi and
i would say uh you work it out at the
state level
let's just make it fair by by state
population
and then you just do it um
somebody says it should be by a head
count that's and that's
what i'm saying you should be by head
count
but the way you get the dollar amount
that you divide by the number of head
counts
is you take the biggest biggest number
and just say we got to do it
timing is more important than perfection
i've told you before that
speed is the new intelligence
with indiv if you've got a programmer
you want one that can build something
quickly
and then reiterate when it isn't good
it's like oh that wasn't good
try another one try another one so a
fast programmer
is better than one who is really smart
but is plodding through to make sure
it's just right on the first try
you don't really want that employee and
likewise with this situation
if you're in a pandemic and an emergency
speed is more important than accuracy
and speed is more important than the
actual
amount speed if
if the president says hey speed is more
important than accuracy
and it's more important than quantity
i'm going to give you the big number
divided by headcount let's do it
tomorrow
that's a pretty strong argument all
right
um i saw a news item i think
new york times maybe this says a new
poll
says that uh 50
of republicans or no 50 percent of trump
supporters let's say
believe the q anon uh theory
that trump is working to shut down a
major
network of democrat-run pedophilia
so q anon believes there's some
organized
democrat pedophilia ring operating
around the country
and 50 of trump supporters believe that
too now i would say it kind of depends
how you ask that question
because i do think i would not be
surprised if 50
of trump supporters believe there are
way too many powerful people
doing their own pedophile thing and that
the president
is the most effective person going after
those
those trafficking and and other rings
so i think that it's true sort of
directionally
that there's too much of it it's a big
issue and they think trump would be the
the strongest
force for it and has proven to be i
think actually the evidence
shows that but here's the context that's
missing from this
if you hear this story out of context
you say to yourself
man all those trump supporters they'll
believe anything
but here's the context i would like to
add if you did a poll
of democrats how many of them believe
that russia collusion was proven by the
mueller report
probably 50 percent wouldn't you think
maybe more
maybe 75 percent how about this do
another poll
how many democrats believe that the fine
people hoax
was real a lot more than 50
90 percent so if you show
only one uh poll and it's about trump
supporters you can make them look
foolish but if you put it in context and
say
oh it turns out that any group of
identifiable people you can convince
half of them
of almost anything it turns out that's a
different context
new york nine nationally
is there anything you see smell or
feel or sense in any way
that would suggest that biden is up by
nine
i don't feel it now we could be
surprised
anything could happen but i feel as
though i can remember when the fake news
at least
tried to be real because
publishing uh you know biden up by nine
that doesn't even feel like you were
trying to tell the truth
does it nor does it feel as though
nor does it feel as though they cared if
you knew it wasn't true
it's like they didn't even care
um yeah uh but
it's not the only poll out as you know
the trafalgar
poll um has has trump winning
so now we have the most credible poll
from 2016
has trump winning the election because
he's ahead in some of the battleground
states
and they do uh the the trafalgar guys do
a much more rigorous attempt to find the
what they call the hidden trump
voters and as of today they're saying oh
yeah those hidden trump voters are a big
deal there's lots of them
and trump's going to win the election at
the same time the new york times says
biden's up by nine
those are different planets so they
can't both be true
uh i'm gonna bet on trump uh already
being ahead
and so let's let's look at how things
are gonna look on
election day and here's some
persuasion related concepts to help you
out
first of all you can see that reality is
subjective now
in a way that maybe you could never have
seen it before because as we're watching
the
mainstream media disappear the story
about
the biden laptop you can see that the
things we imagine
are important in our world are
completely assigned to us
you know i told you i've been saying
this for maybe over a year
that your opinions are assigned to you
by the media that you consume
you think you make up your own mind but
it's just not true
and it's observable measurable it's
obvious
we just get our opinions from the media
and then we adopt the one that
feels right for our team and once you
realize that you
then you start to really understand the
subjective nature of reality
that somebody else can change your
reality just by telling you what to
believe and then
you go do it and
so in this subjective reality it can
change really quickly
and it can change based on what's in the
headlines because if something
leaves the headlines for a while it's
like it doesn't matter
it's like it isn't important anymore
even if it is
and the other part is that you can get
used to anything if you
if you live it long enough so for
example i would say one of the reasons
that the
all the violence and you know the
murders in chicago
are not being solved is because it's
going on too long
and we're just used to it you you wake
up every morning and if you see a
story that says 50 people were shot in
chicago
it doesn't even shock you you just got
used to it
and and do you work on the things that
you got used to
or do you work on the things that are
new and novel and and they're
and they're setting your hair on fire
you always work on the new stuff
because it seems more important hey it's
new people are talking about it
people are arguing about it i guess this
is important it doesn't mean it's
important it just means it's new and
novel
so as long as you understand your brain
is going to concentrate on what's new
and novel
and it's not going to care about what's
important because we don't know what's
important
we only know what's in front of us and
what's exciting us at the moment
so with those things in mind check the
front page of all of your news sources
do this today check check all the
headlines
on cnn all the headlines on fox msnbc
any news source
check all the headlines and see if you
can find
the coronavirus death count for the
united states
for today it's not there
we got used to it the biggest problem in
the country
coronavirus by far right i mean by far
it's the biggest problem
it's not even in the news
because we got used to it now is a
thousand people a day
i think it's a little under that now
dying how big of a problem
is that that's a really big problem
it's gigantic but
how much of your time did you spend
today worrying about
traffic accidents also a very large
problem
fentanyl did you do something about
fentanyl today
more lots of people die from fentanyl so
if you get used to something it just
doesn't affect you
and it falls out of the news because the
news can only run
news that you'll click on and if you
think you've seen that news and you're
bored with it and it's
it's just old story you don't click on
it
so artificial intelligence is not going
to feed you up
more of the old stories they're going to
give you the new stuff
and as as ridiculous as this sounds
the coronavirus being of course the
worst thing that could happen to trump
it's sort of becoming not a story
because we
just got used to a thousand deaths a day
and most of us don't even know anybody
who died
from coronavirus and if we do they're
usually senior citizens and it impacts
us differently
at the same time i had predicted over
the summer
that you should not assume that when it
comes to election day
that the united states performance with
coronavirus will look as bad as it did
back in those months and the argument
was that the other countries that look
like they did a good job
might look like they're doing a bad job
by election day
and sure enough the european union has
zoomed past the united states on the
seven-day rolling average
of confirmed cases uh they just
zoom past us it's not you know it's not
even close i think they doubled
so on election day you're going to say
oh the united states didn't do
or or isn't doing at the moment it did
worse in the past
but at the moment it's not doing worse
than the european union
how will that affect you remember
everything is contrast
everything is compared to something else
so our comparison was we were down here
everybody else was up here but everybody
who was up here is coming down to here
or at least enough of them are so that
you can make the argument of
well look what's going on the other
thing that's
uh happening is that we'll have more
good economic news especially close to
the election
because we're coming off such a low base
it's likely that any economic news will
be positive
stock markets probably good enough the
the biden laptop story is
in the news that's going to be big
and if the biggest story is you know a
china bank account
owned by the trump corporation they're
sort of running out of weapons
aren't they that's all they could come
up with today is he has a
legal bank account in another country um
and then trump is doing a good job of
sucking up the news cycle
i guess he may or may not have walked
out of his 60-minute interview
with leslie stahl and that's just
perfect trump behavior
now you might say to yourself what a big
baby he can't even handle this
tough interview for 60 minutes ah
that's not what's happening what's
happening is that trump
turned you know a story of nothing which
is he did an interview and then the
interview itself would be the story
he turned it into a story about how the
story was made
which is good for trump because then
that changes the frame to the
the fake news is so unfair so he's
sucking up the the news cycles by
walking out of this interview
so now he's got this whole days and days
of
of talking about trump's behavior and
how the media was so bad he couldn't
even sit there to listen to them anymore
and that will soften up whatever happens
you know in the interview itself
when it airs so he's doing a good job of
sucking up all the
the energy there all right here's some
debate strategy
um i don't think any i don't think trump
takes advice
from from the public
about what he should do in a debate and
i'm going to
i'm going to echo something that i heard
greg gutfeld say
on the five which is every time you
think you know what trump should do
you're probably wrong and here's the
reasoning
did you become president i mean
did you you're so smart are you
president
because he is and he got to be be
president by doing a whole bunch of
things you were pretty sure he shouldn't
be doing
so if you've got a guy who continually
do does things that you would not have
done
and you would not advise he do and it
keeps working
because he's the president of the united
states can you really be so confident
that your genius advice he should adopt
versus just being trump because just
being trump
absolutely unambiguously
works that's the one thing we can say
with complete certainty
being trump works now
that doesn't mean it will work exactly
the same for reelection
so you can't automatically say it'll
always work or or you couldn't
you couldn't do it better you're not
going to say that but you should tamp
down your certainty
about your own opinion of what he should
do
you know if you're going to trust the
experts i'd have to say
he's kind of an expert on this stuff
right don't we listen to the experts are
you an expert
did you become president did you beat
hillary clinton spending a quarter of
what she spent
no you didn't you didn't do that but if
you had done that
if you had beat hillary clinton for
president spending a quarter of the
amount of money she did
i would call you an expert because
you're pretty good
so trump is the expert on this
and i would say that it's really sketchy
to judge him or even suggest things
because you know he's not going to use
your suggestions
but i'm going to do it anyway because
sometimes there's a persuasion lesson in
there
but don't think this is serious
in terms of trump actually using them
here are the the things
i would say if uh as as we know
biden is going to bring up coronavirus
because that's trump's biggest weakness
but there is also a time limit in this
venue so trump can make a response
that's his best
response and then sort of run out the
clock here is how i would handle it
joe biden says you you did everything
wrong on the coronavirus and look at our
bad results
if i'm tr president trump i say
well you know even our experts don't
know why some countries are doing much
better than others
that's it are experts who you say we
should listen to
don't know why sweden is doing better
it's kind of a mystery
we don't know exactly why germany is
doing better and we don't know why some
of the
asian countries countries are doing
better we do believe
that things like masks and social
distances matter
but when you study it it's just not that
clear
there seem to be a lot of variables from
everything from
travel to cultural differences how many
how many black citizens are in your
country because they get it worse
what's your obesity situation so we
actually can't tell
how much of that is leadership because
frankly all of the leaders were
following expert advice
nobody ignored experts because you know
that would be crazy so you can't really
tell
not only that but we're doing way better
than other countries
at the moment and he could use the eu
example
so here's here's the mistake way to
respond to the coronavirus
charges the mistake way is that
biden makes an allegation and then you
defend yourself
being defensive looks like losing if
you've noticed
trump is really smart about not
defending
and it drives you crazy because there'll
be some allegation
and you'll say to yourself okay if this
were me if i were trump
i would say why that allegation is false
like i would give the reason
maybe i'd give my source and i would i
would destroy that reason
and he doesn't do it he just leaves the
accusation there
and your hair is on fire and you're like
are you crazy
you're just going to leave that leg
there and instead what he does is he
goes on attack
which is not crazy because if he makes
his attack
more sticky than the allegation he
didn't need to get rid of it
he just needs to make more noise on his
point
than biden made on his point he needs to
make biden look worse than him
he doesn't have to rehabilitate his own
reputation on each point now would you
do that
if i put you in a if i put you in a
debate
would you have the um
let's say that the brains and the
discipline
to not ever answer a direct allegation
that you know you could debunk
you could debunk it with one sentence
could you not do it i couldn't you if
you put me on that stage
i would fall into that trap every time i
would just be defending and defending
i didn't say that that's not true i
didn't do that
you're exaggerating that's what i would
do
bad bad what trump does is he lays down
five nuclear bombs of persuasion
and attacks on on biden until you can't
remember what biden said
like what did biden say i don't know it
wasn't as interesting as whatever this
was
because because trump just set up set a
jungle on fire
i mean that's a lot more heat coming
from this direction
but if it were me i would say your
experts who you love
can't tell why some countries are doing
better and that's part of the challenge
if everybody knew what worked we'd all
be
we'd all have a better outcome but we're
still trying to figure it out
and would the public believe that would
the public say
is that true we can't tell why some
countries are doing better than others
and it is true if they went and they and
they went and looked into it
they would find out that was true uh all
right
here's the other thing that uh trump
could do
that would work you also the joke about
50 cent
didn't like joe biden's tax plan so he
said he's going to vote for trump
and then the joke that went around for a
while i thought i was the first one to
come up with it
but i tested this with my locals
audience
over on locals.com and i asked them if
anybody else
had done that joke before me and i think
the answer is yes
but also that it was such an obvious
joke i guess
that there were lots of people who came
up with it at the same time and probably
thought they were the first ones
that the same as i was hoping i was the
first one
but i i've come to believe that i was
not but here's the joke
50 cent said that with the biden tax
plan he doesn't want to become
20 cent now if trump uses that joke
even though it's been on social media
the people watching it
probably haven't seen it in other words
a lot of the democrats probably have
never seen this joke
if you're on twitter and you follow the
president you probably have seen it
but they haven't and 50 cent is you know
not only
famous and he's black so that helps and
but it's clever
and you would just have to report on
this the next day
you know your if your memory here's a
general
good general rule from uh dr carmen
simon who says this
um you'll remember about ten percent of
what is presented
that's just a general rule if it's a if
it's a powerpoint presentation
if it's a debate whatever it is it's
about ten percent is going to
stick in your memory and be the part
that you care about later
you know when you vote so the president
simply has to manage
to the 10 percent he doesn't have to
manage
to have everything he does better than
everything biden does
he just has to make sure that his 10 is
is bigger and hotter and more
interesting than whatever biden's 10
is he leaves you with and so i would go
with the
taxes
well compared to other countries at the
moment
because even if you don't like what
trump did with coronavirus
back in march if he says
at the moment we're doing better than
other countries
your reason to replace him goes uh well
okay at the moment we're doing better
than other countries
and here's another thing that trump
would never say
but i would you know there's some things
his personality doesn't line up with so
you shouldn't
shouldn't even ask him to try to do this
sort of thing but it would work for my
personality
and i would say you know we were all
guessing in the beginning
we were all guessing because even our
experts
didn't quite know what to do you know we
we saw with masks there was some
uncertainty
and there were other uncertainties so
yeah we made some mistakes
but we have learned from them just as
all the leaders of all the countries
have learned
and at the moment we're on the right
track how would you feel about it
if your leader said yeah we didn't have
a choice
we had to make some guesses everybody
made some guesses
we didn't we didn't do a great job in
the beginning we
learned from that now we've corrected
and we're looking good that would change
everything wouldn't it
because we actually are a quite
forgiving
species but you have to ask for
forgiveness
before it's offered that you know and
although that's not a direct ask for
forgiveness
it does lay out the case that let's cut
everybody a break
we didn't know what we were doing in the
beginning we just didn't know
but we're getting smarter and we've
we've really we think we have this thing
now
that would be a strong argument and it's
the ten percent you would
remember uh in other news trump
administration is suing google
um and i guess that's been filed or it's
official
and it's the largest anti-trust case
against a tech company in more than two
decades
so it's going to be a big deal and
here's the essence of the case
there was a secretive deal under which
google allegedly paid billions of
dollars or allegedly
does right now to apple to ensure that
its search product
is a default on an iphone so in other
words apple
will make sure that your search is a
google search
and they have a deal that they get paid
by google
now given how big of a monopoly slash
network effect apple is and giving that
the complexity of your phone and not
everybody knows how to use all their
technology
you even though you could change that
default
how many people will all right we're
we're creatures of habit
you're not gonna have a reason to change
it you know you might be happy with the
google results
so it's going to be a fascinating case i
don't know which way this will go
but the the issues will be friction
is it do do you have a barrier if the
barrier
is just friction because friction does
change behavior
and if there's friction to changing that
default
away from the google search engine is
that enough of a legal case
can you say you've created enough
friction or taken advantage of friction
to create a monopoly-like
situation because you've taken advantage
of people's lack of knowledge of how to
change their default
or their laziness i don't feel like
that's going to be strong enough
but how about how about a free will
argument
where people don't really have a choice
because they're so busy and they don't
know how to do it and it's not that
important to them
in essence your free will if you believe
that that's the thing
has been hijacked by these companies
colluding
to do exactly that to hijack your free
will
is that an argument i don't know i think
they're going to be some groundbreaking
arguments coming out of this
could be interesting all right we
already talked about
hunter biden's laptop if you're joining
us
late um
you know i'm just going to look at your
comments for a moment see if i missed
anything
oh new york post is doing a cover on the
50 cent doesn't want to become 20 cent
yeah if the new york post did a cover on
it i think that increases the odds
that trump might pull that out during a
debate
because remember the whole thing you're
trying to do is to simplify
and leave somebody with a take away the
thing they they remember
if trump does his usual thing where he
says
biden's going to raise your taxes it's
sort of conceptual
there's no picture involved and then
biden says well i'm not going to do that
if you're under 400
000. but you're not sure if it's true
you know you think trump
might be true you know that he's going
to raise all of your taxes
but maybe not so it doesn't really stick
you're just going to default to the side
that you agreed on
but as soon as you hear the 50 cent
became 20 cent
or could become 20 cent you see him
and you see the 50 become a 20. oh the
50 and the 20 almost become a visual at
that point
that's sticky and could make a
difference
all right um
have i flown with christina yeah i was
saying at the beginning
that christina my wife um
she's taking flying lessons and today's
her first solo flight
uh across state lines she's doing her
first long flight
i have not flown with her and i'll tell
you why
most of her early flying is in what's
called
um what do they call it uh tail
wheel airplanes a tail wheel
has a little wheel toward the tail as
opposed to a tripod
tricycle kind of a situation a cessna
for example has
like three wheels that are placed so
it's easy to land
the plane practically lands itself but
the tail wheels are meant for
aerial acrobatics so the ones doing the
the barrel rolls and the stalls and the
twists and stuff
and those planes are uh hard to land
yeah
the pits for example is a one of the
brands
so those are hard to land and uh
i'm gonna wait until maybe she invites
me to get into cessna
i'm a little freaked out about the
barrel rolls
and the hardest plane in the world to
land
so i'm going to wait for the cessna
situation i think on that
but we'll do that later all right that's
all for now and i will talk to you all
later
how awkward when i try to sign off and
the interface
doesn't work all right let's see if i
can sign off of
youtube
