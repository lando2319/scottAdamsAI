all right i'm here with my special guest
nikki klein you probably know her from
at least
one place maybe two you may have seen
her on battlestar galactica
where she played the role of cali is
that correct kelly that's correct
yep one of my favorite shows of all
times but if you've also watched on hbo
there's a
series called the val which tells the
story of an organization called nexium
headed by keith raniere do i pronounce
that right
right here it's actually rene like
canary roneri
like canary all right i'll probably get
that wrong a few more times
but uh in in the vowel tells the story
of
an organization called nexium which is
spelled
nxivm yes so it's not really
spelled the way it's pronounced uh which
the press would call a cult
but you would call what an organization
yeah a personal development organization
well actually
that that's a rabbit hole on its own
uh merit because nexium was an umbrella
company for a number of other
companies and and initiatives
and the media really kind of
took that label and ran with it and
obviously now when you
when you literally google the words sex
cult
you get nexium and vice versa so
we can get into that later but um so
we'll talk about whether it fits that it
was a community you know it was a
community of people that evolved from
these different
uh companies all right and the timing of
this conversation is important
uh and relevant because there's a court
case
in which uh keith uh renery like canary
has been actually already convicted but
not sentenced
and he's been convicted of allegedly
well
not allegedly he has been convicted of
sex trafficking
forced labor conspiracy human
trafficking and multiple accounts of
racketeering
racketeering dash including sexual
exploit
exploitation of a child and
interestingly
he did not present a defense is that
correct that's correct
and this fascinates me because the very
reputation of
keith renee is
uh is that he's persuasive and it's it's
just mind-boggling that he would not
take the stand
but i'm sure his lawyer had a reason now
um we talked a little bit before this
and
there is something about the trial
that's a little bit
maybe not quite kosher
maybe a little something that raises an
eyebrow maybe a little something
that would make you ask a little more
questions a little something that in our
world of fake news and nothing is quite
the way it seems
this simple act of a trial in which
evidence was presented
a verdict was reached may not be
exactly what you think it was and i'd
like you to tell us about that
we i will ask you some more questions
about about nexium
but i want to i want to jump right into
there's a piece of evidence that was
very important
that may be a little bit sketchy tell us
about that
yes thank you for um for
you know giving me the opportunity to
talk about this i think it's
it's one of the most important things we
live in
the united states we have a constitution
and due process is an integral part of
that
and there are a number of things
starting from the beginning of the
investigation
to the way keith was essentially
kidnapped
from mexico and brought to the united
states to be handed over to
government custody and you know
uh handling of of so-called evidence
and how things were presented at trial
that were
unkosher i think is a is an
understatement
i think an uh a more accurate
word may be criminal a more commonly
accepted word is uh you know improper
on on the part of the prosecution let me
add this a little bit of
context uh if i if i have this right
there were a bunch of charges that if
you were an outsider looking on
and i watched the entire uh episodes of
the vow
and i got all the way to the end and i
didn't see a crime
i didn't even see an alleged crime uh
and that was a
supposed to tell the whole story of the
nexium thing
and i thought to myself well what am i
missing where's the crime part
everything everybody everybody was doing
you know what they wanted to do with
full information according to the
the vow and then i started you know
looking into it a little bit
and there are a number of things about
people being
forced to do things that really fall
into this gray area about free will
like are you really being forced or did
you know what you were getting into
we'll talk about that but
yeah here's my point for context
among all of that gray area that maybe a
jury could have said i don't know maybe
that was just their choice
there was one hard piece of evidence
that probably
uh prejudiced the jury so that all that
other gray stuff
turned black and that's
that one piece of evidence tell us how
credible that is
and so absolutely so the the piece of
evidence that you're referring to and
thank you that was exactly
on point um it was for the
under the racketeering charge the the
possession of
child pornography um and
it was from a hard drive that has
it has been newly discovered was
tampered with and i'll explain what that
means basically
first of all the fbi agent who was
uh questioned on the stand for this
piece of evidence
admitted during the trial that the drive
was
accessed by some unknown person
uh and it was altered the
the files on the hard drive were altered
while it was in fbi custody they don't
know
who did it and they don't know what they
did allegedly
so that is in the trial transcript and
can be found now based on that
um we inquired more deeply and we
asked experts in the field this is these
are
people who who have patents and written
books on the type of file fat system
that this hard drive used and
um you know our experts in this type of
metadata
and what would constitute tampering
so what they found is that
basically in their words there was heavy
tampering
on the device and the specific
metadata that was changed and why it's
relevant
is that the the fbi or the prosecution
used the dates on these photos to allege
that the woman in the photos
uh was underage and that was the only
piece of evidence that
that they presented to to really provide
a
you know in their mind this like slam
dunk
basically to to prove the charge well
was the
photo of uh an underage girl
was she engaged in something on the you
know was it a photo
in the photo yeah it was a nude photo
beautiful okay so that's bad enough and
what was the alleged age of the
person 15. and
um is that somebody you know
and the best of your knowledge was that
a real picture that keith really had on
his
laptop it's hard for me to comment i
mean i'm
no i mean first of all this was a hard
drive that was found
in an attic somewhere hadn't been
accessed in in years and years i don't
even know that anyone could have
accessed it without
some other type of you know forensic
technology
exactly um but but besides that
what what the experts were able to
expose first of all the
pro the defense was not given a mere a
forensic mirror which is
you know as you can imagine a mirror of
the hard drive they were just giving
a pdf of what it allegedly contained
now i don't know the laws well enough i
don't in terms of
like you know brady material and needing
to give the defense
everything that the prosecution has um
access to that is a obviously a huge red
flag yeah that's kind of basic
kind of basic thank you but it sounds
like it sounds like no defense was
offered
did that include the defense didn't
bring any forensic
experts either they just didn't do any
defense
they didn't they cross-examined the fbi
agent
and that's where it was exposed that the
chain of custody was broken
um but beyond that i don't the thing is
the
the defense attorney did not have access
to
the rigorous investigation that we've
now done
you know because um they're
they i guess they just trusted it or
they didn't
think to get an expert to investigate
further but i just want to quickly share
what was also found is that the metadata
with the dates was
altered and it was shown that there was
a photoshop
that a file was created in photoshop and
then saved and then there
the metadata was altered to make it look
like it wasn't
and so what that shows is not only
was it tampered with but the tampering
was
covered up or tried to but whoever tried
to cover it
up didn't do such an exquisite job at
doing that and when they tried to
adjust the daylight savings like account
for daylight savings they actually did
it incorrectly
and that's what exposed um exposed in
the first place
so this is stuff that the uh the jury
never heard
the jury never heard any of this so the
emotion and it was
thrown in in a mountain of prejudice and
and
people you know sharing their this
emotional
kind of hurt that they felt um so
it was very hard to to present a
scientific objective now
did keith have a relationship with this
uh the person who was in the uh in the
alleged photo
at any time did he have any kind of
relationship with her yes for many years
for many years and did it include when
she was under 18.
that i don't know but that was not
uh presented as evidence of the trial
rather that
the photo itself was stood alone as the
evidence
was there additional evidence besides
the photo for that one
specific count not to my knowledge
no no witnesses or anything i
i believe her sister made
might i i didn't read her whole
testimony but i believe her sister made
some allegations which i
as we know first of all testimony is has
its
um limitations
uh but i have many reasons to question
whether
her testimony is truthful in that regard
and others so
but what about the uh the person who was
the child at the time who is now
what in her 30s the person uh late
twenties at this point yeah was she a
witness
she wasn't a witness no what's wrong
with that
aren't you supposed to talk to the
person who is the most essential
person in the entire episode did she
just
not want to think no i believe she
didn't want to talk i mean this whole
situation as you can imagine was
extremely difficult for her she became
central to this to the trial
to this scandal and
um i don't believe at least at the time
that she
she supported the claims and
that she wanted any part of it and
she like like any woman
either women who were in dos or or had
relationships with keith
um were in this very difficult position
because of how
how it was framed and there was
essentially this fudd campaign
to destroy the reputations and
credibility of
anyone who came out and support it was a
very
scary place now are you are you alleging
that there was some person or persons
who may have
uh set keith up or at least tampered
with the evidence
and that it was part of a larger goal to
destroy the organization
is that is that the allegation
well evidence supports that the
hard drive was tampered with that
specific chart
another relevant fact is that that hard
drive was not introduced
until um early 2019
and this was after keith and the other
co-defense
co-defendants were arrested it was you
know as everyone was preparing for trial
it was before the co-defendants
um his his co-defendants
pled and i believe that that was
kind of the straw that broke the camel's
back for them because before that
everyone was like this is crazy and i
was part of this because i was
um i guess what they call an unindicted
co-conspirator
it's very strange but uh you know i we'd
have meetings together and talk about
the case and we were ready to fight
because it was so wrongful doss was so
misunderstood
everything was being talked about in
this way without any context
and we were ready to set the record
straight but i think that that
piece of alleged evidence really
really hurt keith it hurt other people
because it
they thought it was undeniable what
we're seeing now is that
it was completely fabricated so so in a
way that piece of evidence
uh removed the ability for other people
to defend him
wouldn't you say because nobody nobody
wants to defend the guy who has
that photo no and of course like
i would never support someone
who i believed
committed an act such as this and i and
i
i don't support you know on the record i
do not support any type of
abuse of women of coercion of
not just women of any person it goes
against
everything that i believe and i stand
for
but i do think that people were just put
in this terrible position because of the
nature of the charge and what they
thought was evidence of it now um
neither of us are a lawyer so we
probably can't answer this question but
does this new evidence give any
opportunity for a new trial or
thank you for asking so we
we as as citizens as people who care not
only
about keith and and what happens to all
the people we care about in this
situation
but as people who care about justice
feel that this needs to be addressed
this cannot just get washed up
in the mountain of hate and prejudice
that is against keith and anyone who
supports him
because what we have is undeniable
evidence that due process was
corrupted it was violated and if
he gets convicted and it's very likely
based on what the prosecution
has recommended and the way the judge
has so far
handled the case um he will get life in
prison
if he is if sentencing happens on
tuesday
he will get sentenced to life in prison
and it will be on
complete prejudice because
is the uh the trial is it upstate new
york what
what location no it's actually eastern
district which is uh
includes brooklyn okay so i was
wondering about the
nature of the uh of the jury
and whether they were conservative by
nature or
or not do you know anything about that i
mean if it's new york they're probably
left leaning by nature i would think you
would think so
um i believe there were a number of very
conservative people and i know they had
to
had to adjourn for a muslim holiday
because i think there were at least a
few um
people who are muslim and i the other
thing that people brought they
the prosecution brought into the case
they brought in things like
um women who had abortions or
you know the fact even just the fact
that that keith had more than one
partner for some people
is is too much to stomach and then so
that was a huge part of it as well so so
let's dig into some of this because the
context
matters you know if it turns if this is
you know if there's one
charge that maybe wasn't uh quite kosher
but the others were you know true enough
then people aren't going to worry about
the one that doesn't look perfect
but it's the one but can i if you don't
mind me just
addressing that point very quickly um
because i think it's it's a
problem and this isn't exactly what
you're saying but it's just an
opportunity to address that
you know we can think someone is a
horrible person and maybe they've done
something bad over here but if we
overstep the law and break
do violate due process to convict them
just because we think they're bad
we corrupt the whole justice system and
we deny
everyone of their of their rights so
i agree with you from uh from a human
standpoint
that like people's view are gonna be
like well
okay there's this piece of evidence but
he did xyz and he's a bad man and i
don't even care what happens to him but
i would
hope to inspire people to reevaluate
that position because it's a slippery
slope
yeah i you know my audience uh tends to
skew uh conservative and they're they're
big on
the rule of law and the constitution and
i'm pretty sure i can speak for
all of them that if somebody hasn't
actually broken the law
you don't want them in jail even if
they've done other things you don't like
i think everybody
and i want to clear clarify i'm not i'm
not defending anybody
so if it sounds like it what i'm trying
to do is just show a complete picture
absolutely if that sounds like a defense
to anybody listening
that's on you i mean you the listener
know you uh
so let let's continue i've got some
specific questions to to drill down
number one the definition of a cult
would be that you can't leave did you
feel did you feel you could leave
and did other people leave i absolutely
felt i could leave
at any time and many people left and
came back
or didn't you know over 17 000 people
took
executive success programs which was the
you know
and some people loved it and so and
and moved to upstate new york because
they found it so valuable and meaningful
well i moved out of upstate new york
because i found it
not meaningful and not useful so maybe i
would have stayed this way
yeah exactly all right next question
where's we're drilling down to find out
if it meets
the definition of a cult so far
christianity would fit that definition
right because you could be okay
but you could leave so that's that's
same situation
how about were you cut off for from
contact or
uh information from the outside world
never in fact my relationships with
my family i i was able to
have a relationship with my father and
specifically help him through his
addiction and
and help him be healthy before he passed
away
because of all the work that i did in
esp and exploring you know my part in it
and forgiving him and things like that
so
it's quite the opposite i think there
may be
people once they start examining their
beliefs
where it affects relationships i'm sure
you understand this where you know we do
a dance with people we're close to
especially and sometimes when you start
seeing other ways of being that can
create a dissonance
so that i think maybe happened for
some people for me personally i my
relationships only got better and i have
friends all over the world who have
nothing to do with
espn i've never taken it but did keith
ever say to anybody or did anybody
senior in the organization say don't
talk to those outside people
you know don't talk what what about the
um
uh katherine oxenberger oxenburg
and luxembourg yeah india was that her
name
yes um because in in the
in the vowel the series about it it
showed
the mother trying unsuccessfully to
contact her daughter
but it also looked like it was just a
mother-daughter situation
you know there wasn't that's interesting
and there's another side to that because
i was with india during that time
and she tried so many times to
invite her mother to come visit her to
see her life to say
look it's not what you think please come
and her mom never came
no that wasn't that was not in the vowel
was it
there were many things that were not in
the vow i could spend
hours and i promise you it's way more
interesting
so maybe maybe i was joking about doing
un
breaking the vow all right so so so we
don't have
um so you do have access to other people
you're not discouraged from talking to
other people
you could leave any time you want so in
terms of it being a cult
it's not it doesn't it doesn't meet the
most basic
requirements right how about uh
undying allegiance to the leader i guess
that would be the third
big requirement to to what extent
uh did was keith sort of like the only
rule
and what was what was uh
what was the treatment of people who
might have not agreed with what he
wanted
a lot of people didn't agree with what
he wanted and and
keith would be the first person to say
he accepts and welcomes
all criticism and all feedback and
he never asked anyone to call him
vanguard
like that that was a title that was
determined within the context of a
specific
program like like any you know you could
say company or
or school there are titles but he was
keith
and he was a very approachable
human person is given given that he was
it was executive self-improvement kind
of a program
it would be weird if the head of it did
not practice
you know listening to people and you
know incorporating first
yeah now the the other thing that
you don't see so much of in the val they
they allude to it but they don't focus
on it is how useful the program was
to the people who took it in other words
did the people who take
took it give feedback later and say yes
this really helped me
or did they say ah as a big old you know
big old ripoff what what what did people
say when they took the courses
so i don't have the exact statistics but
there was an anonymous surveys given at
the end of every
training and people's satisfaction i
believe there was a question on it that
said this is more valuable than
anything i've ever done or uh
or it's it's worth whatever i could pay
for it maybe the second tier was like it
was worth what i did pay for it
and then it was wasn't worth anything
you know there are all the options and
they were anonymous so there was nothing
to compel
anyone to give one answer the other and
and the people the satisfaction of
people
in the least i believe that it was worth
what they paid was
in the 90 plus percentages
and and i don't think people would come
from all over the world
and these are educated successful people
to something that
17 17 000 people went through the
program at one point
yes that's a lot of repeat customers i
mean i would assume that a lot of that
were repeats
yeah right so where did keith learn his
skills
i i didn't see what is his background is
his psychology
did he ever study hypnosis do you have
give me a sense of
where he learned the special stuff you
know the thing that made him
uh be able to influence all these people
in this way
well it's interesting to phrase the
question
uh that gave him this ability to
influence people in all this way
because that wasn't my experience of him
my experience was
he created a set of tools that
empowered people to think more
critically
to overcome limiting beliefs to
really understand their values and how
they can
conduct themselves in a way that's
congruent with those values
so if people wanted that
he created a structure and a tool set
um that allowed people to do that if
they didn't want that
then you know but what specific training
uh what what was his uh let's say
college degree
um was there anything relevant his
college degree i believe um
and this is something that's become like
scrutinized to people
accuse him of like not being truthful
which
i don't know why he would lie i think he
studied math and
uh math and um
philosophy in school he graduated
early like finished his um university
degree early i don't know that his
the skills and the type of thinking that
he used to create this structure was
necessarily
learned from a textbook i think that he
had
certain awarenesses early on in life and
is a very
outside the box thinker and now
but he never studied hypnosis in
particular that you know
not that i know of no i he did partner
with nancy salzman to create executive
success programs and her background
was in hypnosis and nlp
okay so she you know she found it
yeah i knew it was there i just didn't
know where it was
i knew if i did if i dug enough i would
find it all right
totally so that so her background is in
that and i think he
thought that because she was this um
committed student of this of like
personal growth
ideas that that he could work with her
and help her
create this this new model um
so yeah and i don't i don't know
anything about hypnosis
so so you can probably educate me yeah
so i'm a
trained hypnotist so when i saw keith
talking
i thought well there's some influence or
or course he's taken
because his his approach um it just had
a fingerprint on it
of of somebody who would looked into
this area
more than a casual observer and probably
it was
his partner as you said well and he
might i also don't know
like i i don't know where he
got all of his influences to you know to
have the mind and the
the uh you know his the way he does
things so
now i should say for the benefit of the
viewers who are trying to now connect
dots because they're like oh he got
people
to do things that seem unusual to you
maybe he was sort of a hypnotist or had
one working with him so therefore
he was forcing people to do things they
didn't want but
i'm here to tell you you can't make
people do things they don't want to do
hypnosis doesn't work that way and uh
you know every hypnotist would be a
billionaire if that were true
well that's the joke of this whole thing
like even
the term brainwashing you know if keith
brainwashed people or if he knew how to
do that
this wouldn't have happened like clearly
he
can't because look what everyone went
and did you know this
everyone left and they destroyed
well he's he certainly didn't fight back
against the legal system weirdly
so his lack of a defense is this
gigantic
uh mystery that there may be some reason
for it that i don't understand
maybe a bad lawyer i don't know well i
think if anyone
took the time to actually read the trial
transcripts and
was able to understand
the elements of the charges he was that
were made
they would see that uh there's no
evidence of those charges
that's i'm feeling that because every
when i would read i was i tried to do
some research and read up
and you know what is it exactly he did
that turned into let's say forced labor
conspiracy
and none of the press connects the dots
because i want to say okay he forced
this person to do this
and that is a crime on this book and
it's called
forced labor conspiracy which i've
literally never heard of
and there's like something really
missing in this story
it's really missing first of all because
sex trafficking and forced labor are
serious terrible crimes
that should not happen and we should
care about
as a society the woman who was the
witness for forced labor
she did four to five hours transcribing
a video
oh my god and and she didn't have to do
it
all right so let's get into free will i
will uh
start this by saying uh part of what
makes me semi famous is that i don't
believe in free will
now the trouble is you can't run a
society
if you base it on that because then
somebody would do a crime
and you say well they didn't have any
freedom so
we can't punish somebody for doing
something they had to do but you
couldn't organize a society around that
so we we keep with us this illusion
that people have full control over their
actions
but part of that is that we have to
build our society around that belief or
it just doesn't work
but let's let's dig into this a little
bit now
for background you you had a 10-year
relationship with keith that's correct
over over 10 years but yes and during
that time he had other
partners yes and he asked you
or or you decided to i don't know what
the sequence was
but you ended up and are still married
to alice and mack is that true
oh yeah he he did not ask me to do that
that was
no really of our own volition and
idea yes and and you had a relationship
separately with allison that that
suggested let's get married
and that and that wasn't keith saying
you should get married
no no no we we told him that's what we
were going to do
all right and uh you got branded
you know i'm i'm happy to talk about it
i also want to talk about
kind of the the assumption
in the question and how it's become such
a hot topic
even saying you got branded as opposed
to did you get a brand
has a certain connotation right
you know and i think i believe that
if if it were a group of a fraternity of
men which
often it is and there are fraternities
where men
choose to get brands we wouldn't be
having this conversation
i'm glad we're having this conversation
because i'm i'm happy to talk to you
about it and i think it
it exposes a certain misogyny
um that is ironic i like
i like where you're going because uh let
me see if i could restate that
if men have decided to brand to allow
themselves to be branded
so it's their they're just to brand
themselves yeah and it was just uh let's
say it was the
you know any any male organization would
we even have this conversation
and the answer is not a chance
we we would not be having this
conversation
and if a man came out if a man came out
and said
i i got a brand and i'm so ashamed
and what would we do you would say would
we give them a book deal would we give
them a book deal a cover
on the new york times and a documentary
series on hbo
no we'd say well that was your decision
let's talk about something else
that'd be it who cares interesting so
but there's a part missing for the for
the audience so there were
some there were sub uh organizations
within the larger
nexium one of them was called dos
dos was actually completely separate
from nexium okay but it was
people involved with nexium there was in
the venn diagram there was a crossover
of people definitely okay
and uh the nature of this was some kind
of dominance and submission
voluntary organization where there was a
hierarchy of who was in charge
keith was at the top and were you like
number two or three in this hierarchy
so it's not exactly that keith was
in charge he was more like the architect
you know he in collaboration with
a number of other adult women
because he saw certain
um you know blind spots if you will
that that we had and of course you know
these are these are women that
either know him for 15 years or
more or and some were in romantic
relationships with him
um but who really wanted to level up
who really wanted help to get to the
next level
in terms of you know self-reliance
self-esteem building character and honor
which is something
in my opinion our culture doesn't
support for women
and so he yeah yeah
so describe what doss was
give us the broad strokes of what it was
i think the maybe the simplest
way to describe it is that it was an
extreme
coaching relationship for women
uh and an organization to build a
network of women who were
trustworthy who were honorable
and who sought to bring more of
you know what women can bring to the
world
in a in a meaningful way
but but i mean that sounds good on a
philosophical level sure but on but on
the
describing it level what was the the
nature of your arrangements
so the the basis of the arrangement
is making this extreme
commitment to yourself basically
but in the form of having a master
and the the terminology is obviously
very controversial we use the terms
master and slave they were not set in
stone
they were provocative on purpose um but
they were completely voluntary and were
they were they
sexual necessarily or they were sexual
sometimes i'm sorry to disappoint they
were they were not sexual
not ever not no not in my experience no
so there was nothing about it that would
say uh that
somebody at a higher level in das
could force somebody at a lower level to
do their sexual dating that never
happened correct
no boy that is so mischaracterized
because as soon as they go into this
dominant submission thing
that's where your brain goes and it just
stays there totally
and apparently that was complete fake
news
fake news all right and that's you know
and it's it's not to say that if people
wanted to do that or explore that within
that dynamic that that would be bad
because i think
there's a lot to be explored and there's
a lot that we have repressed
within our sexuality that by doing
things can be
liberating but that's that wasn't what
we're doing
so in the trial was it presented
that uh that were that the dos
organization was
part of the uh sex trafficking
is that what they call the sex
trafficking correct exactly but you're
saying there was no
sex necessarily involved with being in
docs
correct it's very confusing because it
doesn't make sense then it's not true
but there must have been somebody who
was presented as a victim
yes so who who said they were a victim
they got people to say i was a victim
yes the same woman
who transcribed the five hours of video
and claimed to be a victim of forced
labor
said that a sexual interaction that she
had
with keith and another woman um she
claimed
after the fact that it was coercive in
nature
and that it was because she was part of
das um
that that's why she said yes to it
now now uh i
find that questionable but but there's
another uh missing part here that was in
the vowel
there was something called collateral
which the press calls
blackmail material and uh
so people who are in dos were encouraged
to give private
you know what would be embarrassing
information if somebody else knew about
it
to the people that they considered their
masters within the organization
and tell us why that's not blackmail
what how how did you how did you see it
that that was not
coercive okay so first i'll describe the
stages um
if if someone thought that uh i believe
this was somewhat referenced in the vow
of like how someone got
a woman who was anonymous and the vow
was invited and right
and basically you know if you want to
learn more about the organization
because it was
meant to be a secret organization you
give
a small amount of collateral as a
commitment to keep it a secret
that's it so there's nothing you know
the commitment is only
i will give oh you know maybe it's a
naked photo for some people that's
nothing for some people that's a big
deal so it really it was the person's
choice
what was meaningful to them and express
to the person who was then going to
share the secret information with them
that they were going to stand by their
word
and i am nothing against women in any
way but they're not
known for keeping things a secret and so
this
in itself was an act of trust
and so so there so then
if if a woman decided then she she's
like oh i want to know more or like that
sounds sketchy
as no thanks she'd be like bye
that's it end of conversation but no
questions
nobody was ever forced to give their uh
collateral any information no and they
chose what it was that they gave
so then if the woman um you know
said oh this is really interesting i
trust you like yeah tell me more
here's uh my collateral then she would
hear
about the organization and she would
hear everything she needed to know
including that there was a brand um
that you know that it was a master slave
relationship
and she would have the opportunity to
ask all the questions
in the world to make a decision a
decision so she wouldn't learn about the
brand
until after she'd given some
compromising information
to learn about it but before she said
yes to joining
before she okay um so do you think that
members uh felt that that collateral was
really a black male even though it
wasn't presented that way
do you think in their own mind they said
i better do what i'm told i don't think
they did until
it started to become a very specific
narrative in the news and they felt that
their reputation
and their lives would be compromised if
they were associated with it
no one ever like here and let me just
give you some facts
women even women who gave collateral
did leave even before it got the news
they left
no collateral to this day to my
knowledge has been released
period except for what the government
has shared of course
there's nothing the government can't
make worse um
was somebody forced to diet that was one
of the claims
forced to survive on 500 calories a day
to which i say to myself how do you
force somebody to diet
i mean what do you sow them there's so
many problems
first of all yeah how do you force
someone to diet
unless you're just keep lock them in a
cage or whatever
um second of all i think again
there's there are misogynistic
undertones to this because you look at
you know the ceo of twitter is you know
promoting
fasting intermittent fasting going on
low calorie diets and we're like oh
let's give them a ted talk let's
they're heroes but when it's young
some not so young women wanting to build
discipline
and overcome you know indulgent eating
habits or just
feel better in their bodies because you
know they feel in control of their
what they eat then then they must be
victims or someone's telling them what
to do or they're being abused
so all of that is to say yeah some
people
counted calories as part of their
program because they stated that they
wanted to
build that was something that they
wanted like what woman doesn't
want that in a way but it also but there
was an external
uh let's say uh a pure influence
shall we say so here yeah which which
yeah to backtrack a little bit
the collateral if a woman chose to join
dos
it was because she recognized that the
way that
she's doing her life at the moment
she isn't getting what she wants she
wants
to get here and for whatever reason
feels stuck
and i you know i think for most of us
most of us is because we're so
comfortable
we don't have the adversity that forces
us to really like push in the ways we
need to survive
we can all get by life is easy and we
want
we want to achieve better things but
it's hard sometimes to motivate
when you don't have a fire under your
ass so it was
you know a woman who joined us did so
because she's like
i need help i need support i need a fire
under my ass and i want it
i want to someone to
be there for me to achieve my goals i
say
i want this thing i keep tripping over
myself i want someone to be like
hey remember what you said so
is that was that the functional purpose
of the
uh the hierarchy with the masters and
the slaves so that the
people who were the so-called slaves
would have sort of a higher authority to
help them get what they wanted
it was always yeah the well first of all
the higher
the hierarchy yes it existed but
within each it was a system of
relationships so
a master would have a slave and that
slave would also be a master to someone
else like
because it was a holographic experience
and the slave you know the enslavement
that even it speaks to is met
a metaphor for like okay do you want to
be enslaved to your fears
and your attachments or do you want to
be a master of your experience and your
life
and so it was a a construct
to inspire that and the collateral was a
commitment
to that long-term goal it was never
ever used to say oh if you don't do this
this is going to happen ever but people
would be afraid of that
i mean that's what they claim but there
are many women
understand like there are over a hundred
women who are in dust
and there are few who are coming out
with these claims
and i think there's also some
an influence of the narrative on
people where after the fact they're like
right
i was scared but like scared of what
scared because you were facing your
fears and
pushing for things that you'd never done
before or because someone was
threatening you
no one was threatened was anybody held
down
during the branding process in in a way
that they could not get away
uh or or did every person who who
received the brand
were they absolutely voluntary
absolutely voluntary there
there's a uh a practical purpose
of having people like hold your hand
and hold you know because if you squirm
or whatever and
you know but it was not it was not how
it's been described at
all so so here's here's the big question
in
in the val and of course i know this is
made by a filmmaker
so in my mind i'm saying okay look for
the narrative because he's
you know he's he's got and then there's
the music and the yeah
he's got to turn it into a story even if
it's not a story
but part of his narrative was that
people uh
after getting the brand only after would
find out that it was uh
keith renery's initials
and that therefore oh no i've been
branded with his initials
did you know it was his initials when
you
received the brand
so that the brand is a symbol
and i i'm not here to say
it was right or wrong
it doesn't to me it doesn't mean what
everyone
says it means which i think in the vow
or at least i've heard sarah say
like it meant she was property or
whatever
you know there were a lot of um
practices in dos that were inspired
by um concepts and practices that keith
had created
whose idea was the brand well i don't
oh well that's good it's good that
you're asking this question because i
don't want to forget to say
that coming out very soon uh
eight women who were part of das and
more most likely in the near future but
eight women who are willing to speak
publicly now
and make statements and have a
conversation about what it really was
are about to release
um a project where we
have recorded zoom conversations and we
go into the nitty-gritty of all the
details
of what actually happened and we're
doing it very diy because
as you can see the narrative has been
constructed by many people other than us
so i don't want to answer like
every question about you won't tell me
whose idea was
you won't tell me whose idea the brand
was
you don't have to i don't no i'm honest
honestly i'm trying to remember
like there are so many things that were
just
we were coming up with ideas we were
trying new things we were experimenting
it was new but when it was but it was
nice
and like well let me let me let me rule
out one thing
one thing that was not from what what
you're saying
is keith had an idea of branding
everybody and then everybody said okay
let's let's go do that well it wasn't
like that no
no we talked about all kinds of
different symbols and what it could look
like and
we i guess were um
not smart enough to see that
it would be easily uh seen but
it was never it was never meant to be
like that oh it was his initials
okay um and the
the specific location on your body
because it was a little close to your
your your lady business um right was
that just to
hide it or was that telling you yeah
there was a sexual
element to it or not no yeah
there was no sexual element it was just
a place where
you wouldn't like you wouldn't be able
to see it if you were wearing a bikini
and wasn't on your butt i feel like i
feel like viewers are like clicking off
it's like are you telling me there was
it's so boring i know i'm sorry
it was like a bad tattoo that's all it
was it's always
and they didn't look like the one that
has been
shown around the other ones i've seen
okay um those were the main questions
i wanted to ask so so summarizing the
people who were involved
would you say 98 had a good experience
if you had to put a percentage on it in
in dos or esp or both
let's say both or break it down either
one
sure so i think dos is tricky because it
depends when you ask
you know the the narrative i think
really
did a number of on people and their
perception of things
and there were a lot of things in the
narrative that are that just were
false so but they didn't question and
here's the really interesting thing like
there was a woman
um that i had invited into das and
um we had the best relationship i was
like helping her
you know she quit this job that she
hated and was starting her own business
and she was doing great in her in her
marriage and with her family
and suddenly this whole thing started
with sarah and mark where they decided
that this awful thing was happening
and they started this campaign where
they got people to sign
ndas and then told them this horror
story about what happened so this woman
calls me and it's all is so upset
and she can't tell me what she thinks is
happening that's scary or bad
she can't tell me who told her and there
so there was no way for me to
debunk any of her concerns or give her
more information
all i could say is like you know i'm
here whatever you need i'll tell you
anything what what do you think is going
on but it was so
she was just so emotional and scared and
now understanding seeing the vow and
the narrative like i understand why she
was scared but
no one was able to just ask questions
like you are
they weren't inc they they were told to
basically we were painted as these like
horrible monsters and
i people i think don't didn't really
know what to make of me
because i'm a very pretty i don't i like
to think i'm a pretty likable person you
know like i don't think they could make
me into a monster so
then i must be a victim but i'm not
saying i'm a victim so it's very
confusing
um but there's just no room for
discourse yeah this
this is uh one of the most fascinating
studies
of free will and you know when are
people making their own decisions
and when you threw in the the filter uh
the misogyny
uh filter about you know would you think
the same thing if there were the men
involved here that's that's mind-blowing
because as soon as you say that
i go oh you mean if you just change
the genders the whole thing would go
away
change the genders on any of this if if
a man said
oh i had the sexual experience that
you know i was blindfolded and you know
someone performed oral sex on me and
now i need to be protected i need to not
give my last name to even talk about it
to go to prison i don't know how you
made that sound boring
but
all right um i promise my life is
interesting it's just not in the ways
people think
so so here's my my takeaway i'm gonna
i'm gonna
sort of summarize it here and then see
if you would add to this
you had a situation that would be very
confusing for outsiders
the whole nexus nexium thing people were
clearly getting a benefit from it
but there was a uh a
participation element to it
that looked to outsiders like it was
being being forced and i'll give you an
analogy to that
with a stage hypnosis one of the reason
reasons that
stage hypnosis is a good show is that
the people in the audience are thinking
i would never do that i would never go
up on that stage and do those crazy
things it'd be too embarrassing
so therefore the the power that the
hypnotist has over those people and
thank goodness it isn't me but he has
this great like
brainwashing power over them and that's
the show
it turns out nothing like that is
actually happening if you have a hundred
people
in in a room you can guarantee that five
of them don't care about anything
they'll go up they'll take off their
clothes they'll
they'll dance like chickens and when
it's over they won't even be a little
bit embarrassed
because guess what they're not like you
people are different
and totally since we always have this
blind spot
that everybody must be some version of
me
when you see somebody acting in a way
that you can only explain
why they must been brainwashed you can
really easily get that in your head
instead of oh people have different
preferences
and that's the whole story it's the
whole thing and god forbid
women have different preferences right
that go against the social norms no not
not to uh
you know forget the most important
charge here but there is an underage
child element to it uh you would you
would not be
mad at me for saying that if any of
that's true
justice must be served but 100 as you
noted
there's a deep irregularity with that
evidence
that cannot be ignored especially when
you see how
prejudicial all of the other stuff would
make the jury
so i gotta say you've raised some real
questions with me
you know from the outside we don't know
what's real right
we live in a world of fake news we don't
believe anything
uh and we don't believe our systems
anymore we don't believe that the
the government is you know not
organizing a coup against the other side
we don't believe anything anymore so
when when you tell the story
that maybe there was a criminal trial
that
there were irregularities probably 10
years ago
i would have said no they're not that's
what people say
everybody who's guilty says of innocent
but
in the last even the last 12 months
the things you've seen about our systems
that we used to trust
are so disorienting that i hear your
story and
my my reaction is yeah that could that
could totally be true
now i'm not saying i know which which
what is true
there's no way i can know that but i
certainly i certainly don't dismiss it
you've got a hell of a story i hope i
helped you tell your story
because as you said and i hope everybody
watching this agrees
that whether or not there's something in
your life that you did
wrong that must be punished it doesn't
mean everything else you did is wrong
and you don't want to bring all that in
so people either did something wrong and
you can prove it
or they didn't but let's not bring in
the rest of their life to
prejudice the jury all right is there
anything you would like to add
i think just you know on that note
in addition to people from the outside
seeing things that they don't understand
because they do their lives differently
i think
you know what we really were trying to
promote and stood for was
personal responsibility and
accountability and
critical thinking quite not just
accepting what we're taught to believe
and social norms and the conditioning
that we have when we're
younger and i think that our
uh this sort of like victimhood whether
you know woman or man or whatever or
this um reactivity we have in our world
that's so pervasive
uh it it's it's when you overlay that
onto the situation that's that's a big
part of what has created
the misunderstanding and so i i really
want to thank you for the opportunity to
have this conversation with you
because you clearly um well even just
acknowledging whether we have free will
or not
we think we do does it matter i don't
know but
being able to have this conversation
with someone and hopefully with
to an audience who also believes that
they are
either an agent in their life or they
think they are
and that's enough um and to continue
questioning
to really not just take things at face
value and
to challenge that feeling deep down
because even though we know
intellectually
we shouldn't believe the media we
shouldn't believe the government
we do we do and until it happens to you
like i thought that i knew the media
was trash and they lied but until i saw
an article that just
flat out lied about me i didn't
get it so there's a name for that it's
called the
the gel man amnesia there was a
physicist
named gel man that was his last name and
he noted that when he read a story in
the media about
physics because he was an expert in it
he'd say well this is all wrong
i can tell this is all wrong but but he
would say he would have amnesia
because the very next story he'd read
which was not his actually
you say well that's probably right what
totally but but only the things he knows
about are wrong every time
but everything else is right so yeah
exactly
once you live it as you have and i have
of course
yeah it becomes real all right thank you
so much i'm gonna i'm gonna
wind it down now this was even more
interesting than i thought it would be
and i thought it would be interesting
so thanks so much it was even boring too
so
it was interesting even in that way so
thank you so much
and uh and take care thank you
