oh what a day what a day
come on in come on in it's time
it's time for coffee with scott adams
best time of the day
and not only is it the best time of the
day
but this might be the best coffee with
scott adams
of all time now i don't want to build it
up too much
you might be disappointed but i feel
like we have
all the raw ingredients for the best
show ever
and if you would like to enjoy it to its
maximum potential well it doesn't take
much
all you need is a copper margarine
glasses
tanker chelsea steiner canteen sugar
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better including your zoom
calls
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens
now go
oh yeah i feel
the goodness coursing through my veins
so uh i don't know where to start today
it's such a funny day but i'm going to
start with
potential good news all right oh yeah
we'll get to jeffrey tubin
we'll get to that let's start with some
potential
coronavirus good news so in
uh reason the publication reason
they estimated in an article that would
cost around 20 billion dollars
to provide 330 million americans so
basically all of us with home test kits
at a dollar a piece for weekly use so it
would cost you one dollar a week
to test yourself at home with these test
kits
and it would only cost 20 billion
dollars
now if you had vaccines
or you knew that vaccines were coming
how does that make you feel
well it might make you feel optimistic
but a lot of you are thinking i'm not
sure i want to sign up for the vaccine
first maybe maybe you other people take
the vaccine
and a couple months from now i'll i'll
check into it
so we have some bad feelings about
vaccines
that is neither conservative nor liberal
there's just a general
uncomfortableness with rushing that sort
of stuff
quite reasonably but suppose i told you
this
that the government had a plan that by a
certain date
we would have enough tests that you
could get a test once a week for a
dollar
and everybody could do it as much as
they wanted it's just a dollar
how would that make you feel if let's
say you knew that we could do that by
end of the year you'd be you'd be pretty
happy about that because that feels like
the end of the pandemic
now it wouldn't end it you know with one
crushing blow
but if everybody could get a test for a
dollar once a week
you would really be putting your boot on
on the bug
at that point so
you might ask yourself well if it's only
20 billion dollars
and in the context of spending literally
trillions to get past this pandemic 20
billion would be
quite a quite a deal but i'm a little
unclear
about whether the fda has approved this
so the article was a little unclear in
that so i need a fact check on that i
know that it was
illegal to to authorize these and there
was some
some obstacle i don't know what it was
but at the moment there are a number of
companies
say the article in reason including
biotech
startups e25 bio
aura and then there's aura sure and 3m
etc
so there are a bunch of companies making
these tests
here is how president trump could win
the election
pretty much indeed he would need to
produce
a roadmap very simple roadmap
that says here's where we are and by
this
date we'll have enough tests
that every person can get a test for a
dollar at home
and you'll have quick results now if he
told us
that here's where we are and here's the
day that we'll have enough tests
i would feel like i saw the end of the
pandemic
it might not be but it would certainly
feel like it
wouldn't it how long would that take
and what would it take the government to
get that done well i would just like
visibility on it
i would like to know is there an fda
obstacle
if there is still a legal obstacle when
will that be removed
and how long does it take these
companies to ramp up
give us a little visibility into those
companies
and tell us how close they are just just
sort of put it on paper
one page here's where we are here's the
date we'll have enough tests
to test our way out 20 billion dollars
i would feel that that would pretty much
settle the election
really because the coronavirus situation
is going to
turn on how you how scared you are about
the pandemic
and that would take a lot of the scare
out of it apparently there's
the new rule for the presidential debate
is that the microphones will be turned
off
when it's not the candidate's turn to
speak
what do you think that's going to do to
president trump's
debate game well your first
impression might be oh no he can't
interrupt and it's the interrupting
that's
sort of the fun part and gives it a life
but i would argue this is going to work
in trump's favor
because what was the one big thing that
people didn't like
about trump's performance last time
the people who were you know sort of
would like to like him
you know maybe they could be convinced
if they see him acting like a bully and
talking over everybody
and trying to dominate the debate do
they think better of him
or do they think worse i think that the
people who are persuadable that that
tiny little sliver of people who need a
reason to go one way or the other
i feel like they would like trump more
if he doesn't even have the option of
talking over biden
now as trump has said and other people
have said if you let biden talk
without interrupting him maybe he'll
he'll have an
own goal or he'll force himself into a
gaffe
and you'll be better off letting him
talk
i think there's something to that but
beyond that
even a bigger deal is having trump look
more presidential
just because he was forced to if you
force
trump not to interrupt he's just going
to look more presidential
it's going to help him so i don't know
if the people who made that rule
in the back of their mind we're hoping
to handicap
trump but i don't think that's what's
happening i think this is going to work
to his favor
um you may recall that uh early
in the pandemic i was saying don't judge
who are the countries that are winners
and who are losers
because it's only halftime and you can't
say that the united states did worse
than
some other country if the game isn't
over
now of course it's not a game because
it's life and death but you understand
the analogy
so we're seeing now a big uptick in some
countries
in eastern europe and south america
where they're getting a second wave
that's pretty bad
so we hope that it doesn't get worse but
i would remind you
that we don't know how this ends we
still don't know
why some countries do better i mean
think of that
we still don't know why some countries
do better
now i've of course you're going to say
well it's masks or
social distancing or whatever and those
things
i'm pretty sure make a difference but
they don't seem to make enough
difference
to explain the massively different
outcomes from different places
so it's still kind of a mystery what the
big variables are we know some of the
small ones
all right i was trending on twitter
yesterday anybody noticed that
so i didn't see it myself but a number
of people told me that
i was trending and i think that was
after i appeared on
msnbc now you might say to yourself
you were on msnbc do they let
people who support president trump on
msnbc
i didn't even know that was a thing well
yes
apparently it doesn't happen that often
but i was invited on
uh ari melber's show and i have to admit
i thought it was gonna be contentious
i i thought he was gonna you know try to
embarrass me or put me in an awkward
situation or
accused me of being a racist for
supporting the president or something
i didn't know how it was going to go but
it did not go that way at all
and i would say that ari did a a great
job of just
you know playing it right down the
middle and he it wasn't a biased
interview in any way
and he was very complementary so
apparently he's read my books and
had a good feeling about uh at least my
my other work
so uh it was very disarming to me as
well
because i had in my mind you know sort
of a combat plan
and i thought okay as soon as the as
soon as the bullets start flying this is
going to get good and
i knew what i was going to do if it if
it got uh
testy but it never got dusty it just
stayed friendly
which was uh excellent because i think
the country needs to see people
getting along once in a while right
uh it was weird in one sense
because uh i was introduced
with somebody else's work i've never
seen that before
have you have you ever seen somebody
introduced
by showing somebody else's work who's a
competitor to the person who's being
introduced
so they started off by showing a clip of
the movie
office space which some have said
is a rip-off of dilbert because it came
came into being at the time that dilbert
was becoming popular which
which proved that there could be a movie
on that topic
and then mike judge made one now there's
no indication that he was looking at
gilbert when he made it
but many observers say that it was
you know at least a little bit
influenced
by dilbert uh so that was weird i've
never seen
anything like that before to use
somebody else's property
to introduce somebody who competes with
that property
it was strange but they were very nice
to me they should show the clips and
mentioned my book etc so here's where
i ended up trending um i didn't realize
just how bad the silo was the new silo
and how the people who watch msnbc
really really don't know what the rest
of the country is thinking
and while you know that intellectually
when you when you see it in real life
it's still jarring
even though you sort of know it on some
intellectual level
so um i i went through my explanation
of what the election would look like and
the way i framed it was
that people vote based on their fears
and that
president trump was working against his
own re-election interests
because he had solved some of our
biggest fears
and i mentioned that i'm no longer
afraid of isis for example
i used to think about terrorist attacks
all the time
and while of course there's always that
risk i don't think about it
it's not my mind anymore so i'm not
afraid of isis
and that's that's new within i would say
within the
uh trump administration i also mentioned
that when trump is president i'm not
afraid
of the economy melting down because
there's good evidence to suggest that
he's a
he's a the most capable hand for the
economy
but then i also just to be fair said
that if uh
if president trump loses the election
it'll be because of the coronavirus
because that fear is in our faces all
the time every time you reach for your
mask
you're you're reminded of the
coronavirus and so
the immediacy of it and the fact that it
permeates just
everything makes it our most important
topic and it's probably objectively it
probably is the most important topic
and so
[Music]
i then i was asked what my
prediction would be and they had already
shown my prediction from 2016 which i
was right
that president trump would be elected uh
and then i said in my most confident
voice
that as of as of today president trump
will get reelected
now i don't know if the viewers of msnbc
have ever heard that and the reason i
was trending
is because the msnbc viewers just sort
of went nuts
and i want to read to you some of the
reactions
from the msc nbc viewers
who heard me say confidently one of the
few people who was right in 2016
in public a lot of the voters were right
but there weren't too many
pundits saying confidently that trump
would win in 2016.
uh so tom arnold tweeted at me
today and uh he
he said they used the clip of mike
judges genius office space
to intro dilbert guy and that he refers
to me
tom arnold does as donald trump
apologist and world's most disingenuous
human scott adams
and so i tweeted back to ask him if
there's any kind of a trophy
that comes with being the world's most
disingenuous human
and i thought to myself
there are a lot of i've been insulted in
every way that you can be insulted
but when somebody says i'm disingenuous
about the
political stuff i stop and think
disingenuous in what possible way i mean
i don't even
understand the the insult i mean if
somebody calls me
stupid or untalented i know what that
means
you know even if i think they're not
right at least i understand it
but disingenuous why
why would i be disingenuous because
saying that trump will win or saying
anything good about trump
is certainly not good for me it's not
good for my career
cost me a fortune it's not good for my
social life
cost me most of my friends it's not good
for me
safety wise because i you know i worry
that if i go outside and i'm recognized
somebody will hit me with a big object
so why would i be lying about it
what would what would be my motive to be
disingenuous
am i trying to lose money and be in
physical danger
is it because i like the attention i of
course i like attention but
i'm pretty sure i could have gotten a
different way
you know alyssa milano got plenty of
attention and she wasn't backing trump
so i know i can get attention i don't
need to get it this way
so you know i'm not i'm not mocking tom
arnold
i'm just it's jaw-dropping
when you see somebody else's
interpretation
that you have the advantage of because
it's your own mind they're talking about
i mean this is a stranger someone i have
never met
who is evaluating in public my inner
thoughts
how likely is he right about that well
he's not right
because i certainly don't think of
anything i'm doing as being disingenuous
i think of it as
precisely the opposite by design i hear
what some other people said in the
comments
when uh these are people who saw me
appear appear on msnbc
and keep in mind this is the first time
they've heard anybody say confidently
that president trump
is likely to win reelection first time
they've heard it in months
here were some comments quote i felt
physically ill when he said this another
one
it made me sick actually it made them
physically sick to hear this
depress the hell out of me that he made
such a declaration i hope he regrets his
prediction
notice that there's always a little bit
of revenge built into the comments
they actually want me to suffer because
of my prediction
literally want me to feel pain
because i have an opinion of what might
happen in the future this is really sick
stuff
uh here's another one after the
interview my husband said quote i'm
throwing scott adams autographed book in
the trash
another one said i was devastated when i
heard that
who is devastated watching television
when was the last time you were watching
something on the news
and it and it wasn't you know about some
terrible tragedy or something
when when have you ever watched just
some ordinary political
pundit thing in the news and felt to
yourself sick in your stomach
or devastated or
hear some more of them i don't agree
with anything said by scott adams
he's a well poisoner he shows up to
create havoc
i'm a well poisoner why would i want to
poison a well
why would i want to poison anybody's
well
why would i want anything that's not
generally good for the united states
as a whole why would i want that in what
world
would any of that make sense uh here's
some more
that was frightening i'm still bothered
so people were shaking
they were just like shaking with anger
and pain
and stomach aches because they heard
somebody who didn't look crazy
that say that trump could win reelection
and he could do it on the strength of
being good for the economy and
you know good for international stuff
here's another one i threw up in my
mouth when i heard him say that
so um
it was really really interesting
to see the the depth of uh
how how low the information is on the
left
i would argue as i've argued many times
that the people on the right
they can't avoid seeing the information
from the left
because it's permeates everything so
whatever the
the left narrative is everybody knows
that
but the left does not see the right and
the first time they see somebody who
doesn't look insane
with an opinion that actually is
coherent they didn't know what to do it
actually made them sick
to hear a different opinion i mean
seriously when was the last time you got
sick hearing an opinion
i think it's zero times for me all right
let's talk about uh
the best story of the day jeffrey tubin
are you ready for this um
so i believe by now you've all heard the
story that uh
cnn's legal analyst jeffrey toobin
was on a zoom call with some of his
professional colleagues
believed that he had turned off his
camera and sound
but he had not and then he proceeded to
since this is a family show let's say he
decided to
address a package to his home address if
you know what i mean
let's say he decided to be a an
army of one if you know what i mean uh
let's just say he decided to take
matters into his own hands
if you see where i'm coming from and
apparently he did that
on camera is with his colleagues
in a aghast apparently
and he was asked to go on a little bit
of leave of absence from his
his two jobs including cnn
so we had a little fun with it
didn't we but i'm going to trip you up
here
are you ready you don't see this coming
i'm going to fully support
jeffrey toobin now i don't agree with
his political opinions
quite often but the mistake he made
was not a crime nobody was hurt
his intentions were not bad it was a
very
human mistake which is what makes it so
delightfully entertaining
it was the most human of human mistakes
i can personally not dislike him
or mock him for being a human being who
does a very
human thing that just happened to be the
funniest
human mistake you could possibly make in
the entire world
so uh i want to be completely clear
that i don't think he should lose his
job
i think he became more interesting in
other words
the first time that i hear that jeffrey
toobin is back on cnn and i hope they
take him back
seriously because i don't think this is
any kind of a crime or anything
he will be more interesting i hope
that he has a sense of humor about it i
hope that is
that his wife and his i think he has a
teenage daughter or something i may be
wrong about that
but imagine how horrified she was
and the wife had to deal with this and i
would like to speak directly to
jeffrey toobin's family and say give him
a break
just just cut him a break he didn't want
to do it it was just a human mistake
that's all it was so don't take it
seriously but let's have fun with it
because it was the coolest human mistake
anybody ever made
now i ran a little poll on
on twitter of course it's not a
scientific poll but i asked this
question
i said have you ever pleasured yourself
on a zoom or conference call
i got over 12 000 responses and
uh here were the the three choices
number one
that's the best time 38
38 of respondents said that they have
pleasured themselves on a zoom or
conference call
because quote that's the best time
number two the other choice was i hate
pleasure
28 signed up for a hating pleasure so
they have not done that activity
and then 34 answered too scared
and i i of course created the third
choice
so that the only reason you would not do
it is you were afraid of getting caught
so uh i would not assume that this is
too scientifically accurate as a poll
but 38 said that's the
that's the best time
so i would like to give you my
confession
are you ready for this uh i'm going to
confess to you in public
right now no joke this is an actual
confession
that at least once in my entire
decades of life on this planet at least
once
totally true at least once in my whole
life
not recently but at least once
i have been on a phone call and or
conference call
and or zoom and i have multitasked
i've multitasked i would be in the 38
percent
who answered my survey by saying that's
the best time
but if it's any comfort to
to jeffrey toobin um
you know and i'm just going to say i am
spartacus
this is the closest i've ever come to an
i am spartacus moment
and i want to say hashtag me tubin
me toobin um
but i would like to also add a defense
to jeffrey tubin because i know this
will come up one of the things you're
asking yourself is
is it because it was somebody on his
zoom call
who was unusually attractive and that he
was sort of responding to
an actual person on the call which would
make it worse
right like you would be extra creeped
out if it was because there was somebody
on the call
now we've seen a picture of the people
on the call
somebody was nice enough to show some
public photos
of the other people who were alleged to
be on the call
i would rule out the possibility that he
was inspired by the other people on the
call i don't want to be unkind
i'm just saying it's very unlikely
that the people on the call were who
inspired him
and i would also like to say that and
this is for the benefit
only for the benefit of the women who
are listening to this
because all the men already know this
so this is universal male knowledge that
if you're a woman you'll be hearing it
for the first time
we don't really need a reason
if you're saying to yourself what was it
that inspired jeffrey tubin
at that very moment to engage in that
activity
ladies we don't need a reason
don't we doesn't really have to be
inspired by anything
we don't really need a reason being
bored
is enough of a reason and let me say
this
if if you've ever been bored on a
conference call
and you're a guy and you're alone
and it's a really long conference call
and you don't have to talk
and you're just all by yourself at your
home office
you've probably at least thought to
yourself is there anything else i could
be doing now
so that's just for the benefit of the
women who don't know how
men think but let me read to you some of
the jokes that came out of this that
were just precious
now one of the advantages i have and i
did this intentionally
is i do this periscope early in the
morning so if there's anything
that's new i can get it while it's fresh
because anybody who goes on like i feel
sorry for uh
you know the the people on the five you
know because i have to wait till the
afternoon to talk about this
actually they may have talked about it
yesterday but anybody who has to wait
you know all the good jokes are already
gone so i i created that uh
web cartoon called robots read news
where that's just a robot reading the
news and he never changes so i don't
have to do the art
and i can just quickly retype new words
into the comic and publish it
so i can be the first one to use up all
the good jokes before other people get
to them
but people were very fast and here are
some of the
jokes that came out of this
first of all the hashtag metuben
metuben is the best hashtag ever and
if you're wondering if we live in a
simulation i
i would like to uh i would like to offer
this
evidence of the simulation what are the
odds
that the one guy who gets caught in this
behavior
also has a last name this sounds a
little bit like
the behavior you hear me let's say
i had been caught making the same
mistake
could anybody make fun of my last name
would they say
yeah he was adamsing
doesn't really work right um how about
you know any other name yeah he was he
was smithing
nothing nothing but if you say
he was tubing doesn't that
sound a little bit like the thing he was
actually doing
yeah yeah jeffrey was tubing
he was tubing all right so i don't know
what the
odds of having a last name that sounds
exactly like the thing you got caught
doing
but it's probably small it's probably
small
the odds are small as is um here's some
more jokes
uh somebody said that it was russian
disinformation and that that was not
actually his penis
that that was russian disinformation um
because i said
i used a joke that my father had taught
me when i was a kid
but uh i said uh i wonder what the
market price is
for a screenshot of jeffrey tubin trying
to count to 11 on zoom
i'll pause for a moment while you
explain that joke to whoever you're with
who didn't get it
count to 11. okay you with me everybody
caught up
okay we'll go on um and then
for my robots read news comic uh this
was the
the robot reading the news he said
jeffrey toobin has been yanked off of
cnn
for lube in his tube and on a zoom call
brian stelter
also known as the poor man's jeffrey
toobin i was proud of that
uh defended his well-haired clone by
hunterizing the story into oblivion so
i'm trying to create that
that verb hunterizing that makes us
means making a story disappear
dr fauci advised that it would be safe
to go back to shaking hands after the
pandemic
with quote everyone except toobin
all right so that was my contribution uh
then the panda tribune said in a tweet
what's the big deal the motion was
sustained oh no the motion wasn't
sustained
hashtag me tubing and
here's the one that made me laugh the
hardest this is the
the simplest one but it made me laugh
the hardest
somebody said he fell on his sword
i i'm sorry that's just that's just
hilarious he fell on his sword
that's so visual somebody else said
uh who is this uh strand i think said
this
that i guess the zoom call was supposed
to be
an election simulation they were talking
about an
election simulation so uh
strand said uh it wasn't he must have
misheard it and he thought it was an
erection stimulation um
and then pete on uh
on twitter he he got inspired to start a
uh
a video platform he's gonna call it
youtubing
so on youtube and uh his new video
platform
uh he says my new channel will give up
and coming creators a chance to expose
themselves
ah and then of course there was a tweet
that said that
jeffrey toobin had uh quote asked for
some personal time off
and i tweeted an update to the update
and i said update
he only needed 10 minutes
so so and i would just like to offer
this
this additional uh pro tip
that apparently uh the problem was that
tuban thought that his
his camera had been turned off and
um here's my pro tip if you need to turn
the camera off
you're a rookie because you should have
prepared before the camera came on
and then you could enjoy yourself all
the way through the zoom
nobody needs to be the wiser now the
other thing that's hilarious about this
is there are a number of articles and
tweets and stories about jeffrey tubin
and of course they they look for a
picture that's available
on you know some place that they can
grab a photo and run with the tweet
the photos that people are running with
these jeffrey tubin stories
are so freaking funny because tuban is
one of these
uh wide-eyed people where when
he appears on tv his eyes get bigger and
now every photo i see where it's you
know where it's a
video or a photo from let's say the
chest up you can just imagine what's
happening from the chest down
and his face by coincidence his face
looks exactly like he's not wearing
pants
so he's always got he's got this
wide-eyed face like
like whatever's going on below the
camera view
it's probably more exciting than
whatever is happening above the chest if
you know what i mean
all right ah that's just the best story
ever um
let's talk about something else so uh
rapper 50 cent saw joe biden's tax plan
which would tax him in california at 62
percent
62 i don't know i'm laughing because
that would be my tax
that would be my tax rate if biden wins
62 percent
and 50 cent said basically screw that in
the endorse
trump and so i tweeted about
the 50 cents endorsement i said no one
wants to be 19 cent
now i don't know how many people check
my math
but if you tax 50 as 62
you end up with 19 left over so
50 cent doesn't want to be 19 cent um
so let's talk about the real news
so the biggest it looks like the biggest
problem
for biden that's coming out of these
emails the
the hunter biden emails on the laptops
is
the reference to this it says 10 held by
h for the big guy h we believe is hunter
the big guy we believe is his dad
and then in the context of the email the
10 being held
was was money so
the way that the way the email looks
it's a little cryptic
but it sure looks as if hunter is saying
that he's going to hold some money
so that you know there's no digital
record of his dad getting the money but
it would be for the benefit of his dad
the big guy
and what happened by coincidence
is that because the debate is scheduled
on thursday
it allowed joe biden to put a lid on and
pretend that he's using
all of that time to practice and get
ready for the debate
because he can't be in public because
he'll be asked that question
right so he has to stay completely out
of the public
because even if he refuses to take
questions
the video will be people shouting
questions at him and him not answering
or he might answer you know awkwardly or
or angrily or something like that
but it is amazing
to me that this story is out there and
is being
completely ignored by the media on the
left
now could it be that if you asked joe
biden what does this mean or you asked
hunter biden what does this sentence
mean
maybe they have a good explanation but
they haven't offered one
what does it tell you that neither
hunter biden nor joe biden
have offered a denial about the laptops
a denial about the emails being accurate
haven't said a word about the truth of
them which of course tells you that they
they know they're accurate here's what
one of the articles on cnn said it was
talking about trump saying that barr
should appoint somebody before the
election to investigate
and this is the sentence on cnn it said
trump says bar must quote appoint
somebody before election to investigate
the baseless biden claims baseless
what do you mean baseless i just read
you the sentence
in the email on the laptop
that indicates an obvious crime
which would be if if true would be such
a
horrendous crime and abusive office
that it would change the entire nature
of politics and
if not the world because you know
whoever's president in the united states
has a big
impact on the world and cnn
has the gigantic brass balls
to say it's baseless what would be their
what would be their backing to say this
evidence
which might not be true it might not be
exactly what it looks like
might not be but is it baseless
this is the base this is the base
so they just don't report it and they
can call it baseless
watching this happen in real time is so
mind-boggling
to to see that you know our trusted
institutions have fallen this far
you don't even know what to say about it
because it is so
beyond imaginable really
but of course boosting this ridiculous
stance that it's a baseless claim
as you know clapper and brennan
and 50 other ex-intel people
have put out a letter in which they say
let's see what did they say uh outlining
their belief
that the recent disclosure of emails
allegedly
allegedly belonging to joe biden
really allegedly now i get
that anything could be wrong but
allegedly
okay let's i'll keep i'll keep it with
allegedly because
they could be fake if it's not
impossible
just unlikely given that they haven't
denied it
and they said they outlined their belief
that
has all the classic earmarks of a
russian information operation
even though they acknowledge in the
letter that there is
no evidence whatsoever that it is a
russian
disinformation operation think about the
balls of this
these are the same clepper and
brennan
who have been caught pushing the biggest
disinformation campaign in the history
of the united states i think
which is the russia collusion hoax
they did it they got caught it's
documented and they're just doing it
again
they're doing it again how can they have
the guts
to do this this is the most gutsy
just crazy thing that i've ever seen
because is there anybody in the country
who reads this
and doesn't know that these are the same
guys
literally who just ran a coup attempt
against the united states
with a massive disinformation campaign
against the citizens of this country
blaming russia and they're just going to
do it again
they're just going to do it again i
don't know what even what to say about
that
my head is going blah blah blah blah
blah and
apparently there's nothing we can do
about it because
as long as the the news treats it like
it doesn't exist
and the republicans probably don't have
enough power
and may have even less power to do
anything about it
if joe biden wins it just goes away
it just goes away and they probably get
government jobs and stuff
so i tweeted this this morning that got
a lot of
uh pick up i said is it my imagination
or our ex-intel heads
from the obama biden administration
running a completely obvious
disinformation campaign on the american
public
while asking to be returned to power
that's actually what's happening and
i'm not guessing i'm not guessing
it's right in front of us there's
nothing hidden about it
and they even say in their letter that
they have no evidence that it's russia
it just looks like a russian
disinformation campaign
do you know what else it looks like it
has
all of the let's see to use their words
it has all of the classic ear marks
of the same thing you did in
2016
17 and 18. do you know what classic ear
marks this has
it has the classic earmarks of you
 guys
trying to overthrow the country again
with a disinformation campaign against
the american people
you should be in jail this should be
jailable i don't know what crime it is
but it should be jailable if you've ever
been
uh ahead of a u.s intel
agency and then after you've left office
you run a disinformation campaign
against the american people
that ought to be a a crime can we not
make a crime can
can congress not pass a law that says
you can't run
a disinformation campaign if you used to
be the head of the cia
or head of an intel agency i feel like
that's important
it's amazing all right
and why is it not the only headline
can you think of every story that's
happening of course the election's a big
deal coronavirus is always a big deal
but what is a bigger story than
50 intel agencies including two
heads are running an obvious
and obvious is the key word there's not
any question about it
an obvious disinformation campaign
against the american people
why are we talking about anything else
there's nothing
there's nothing going on that's on the
same level as this
and the and cnn and the whole left will
just
disappear they'll just make it go away
and that's what's happening right in
front of you so ice cube
you all know ice cube uh
he's uh decided that he was willing to
talk to the trump administration about
his
plan for black america and he's also
talked to
some biden people and of course he's
taking tremendous heat from the
black community for talking to the trump
campaign at all
because the feeling is that you
shouldn't work with them because they're
so bad
uh you're selling out your any number of
names that you get called
if you work with white people in power
and here's my take on that and i tweeted
that ice cube is demonstrating a winning
strategy
by putting effectiveness ahead of ego
and that his critics are demonstrating
the opposite
by by putting their ego ahead of
effectiveness ice cube
is doing um one of the most important
things
that's happening today it's one of the
most important things
which is that he's he's role modeling
how to be effective the thing that i
don't think
black america understands about white
people
is that white people don't like acting
like white people
i don't like dressing the way i dress
because i
i would love to dress like any you know
fashionable black guy
because why does it seem like black guys
are all well dressed
am i right and whereas i've you know
i've got my stupid khakis on or whatever
the hell i'm wearing
and i just look like every other white
guy in the world i don't want to
i don't want to act like a white guy but
i can't i can't pull off
the other looks so i don't really have
that option likewise
i don't want to uh be nice to my boss
just because i want to raise later you
know there are a whole bunch of
behaviors where
your average white guy is sort of
sucking it up and playing along and
doing what is expected and going with
the flow
we don't like any of that but the reason
we do it
the reason we sublimate our egos
is because it's effective it works
so if i if i can manage my ego down
then i can take a job with a terrible
boss and
terrible conditions but i can turn that
into something good
for me and my family right so i'm gonna
i'm gonna lower my ego
eat a eat a pound of crap
to get something done and
that's what ice cube is doing he
of course had to know that talking to
the trump administration
on this topic was going to cause him to
eat
ten buckets of crap from the people that
used to be his friends a day ago
he knows it's a reputation hit he knows
it doesn't make him look
cool to the people he might want to look
cool to
he he's taken a risk it's a big one
and so he's also modeling how to succeed
because ice cube remember i've told you
um
this quote that is just just my favorite
quote about success
and i i always feel bad because i don't
know who said it first i just
stole it from somebody i heard it once
and it's this
if you want to be successful figure out
the price
and then pay it figure out the price of
success
and then pay it and that you'll be
successful
ice cube figured out the price's success
so he not only did he go do the work of
putting together
you know a plan he did the work
he's not just a celebrity he was talking
on twitter or something he did the work
he put together a plan congratulations
icecube i appreciate that as as a
citizen
and as a patriot thank you
thank you for doing that now i might not
like any of the ideas on there
i haven't looked at them in detail but i
certainly
appreciate you know the the
american-ness
of putting the plan together and
promoting it but he did this at great
personal
expense so he took the advice you know
you want to succeed
figure out the price and then pay it
so ice cube figured out the price which
was you got to put a plan together
and you're going to have to make
yourself look really really bad
because you're gonna have to work with
some people that other people think you
shouldn't be talking to
he figured out the price and then he
paid it
so if this isn't one of the best
american things going on
i don't know what is compare that to
robert reich noted uh democratic booster
who wrote this tweet and just compare
these two people
in terms not the people but their
strategies
all right this is robert reich he says
when this nightmare is over
talking about you know our current
situation we need a truth and
reconciliation commit
commission all in capitals truth and
reconciliation commission
it would erase trump's lies comfort
those who have been harmed by his
hatefulness
and name every official politician
executive and media mogul
whose greed and cowardice enabled this
catastrophe
so robert wright is putting together a
strategy to make americans hate each
other
and start a civil war
how does that work how is that good for
america
this is terrible don't follow this guy's
example this is the worst
this may be one of the worst things
you've ever seen tweeted
and i mean that seriously one of the
worst things
ever tweeted because this is this is
giving
is sort of a making normal
essentially a nazi policy of hunting
down the people who lost the election
and punishing them he's trying to
normalize
nazi behavior now compare that to ice
cube
who's putting a plan together to help a
community that you know needs some help
and he's working with people that are
hard to work with
and it's going to cost him a lot putting
his reputation
his ego on the line don't compare these
two people
ice cube a-plus rubber rice
garbage just garbage
this is this is just embarrassingly
bad for the country on a more positive
note
every now and then i will see a
politician doing good things and i'll
say to myself
i'm glad that person's on the case
and i say that every now and then about
ted cruz
uh the context here is that uh i guess
mark zuckerberg and uh jack dorsey
separately they're gonna testify
uh to congress and i guess ceos as
google's ceo sundar pichai
pca so next wednesday they're going to
talk to the senate commerce committee
and they're going to be talking about
section 230 the communications decency
act and all that
and ted cruz is sort of you know i would
say he's
leading the uh this issue
and can you think of anybody better
i mean really yeah as much as i just
you know insulted robert reich for doing
the wrong thing
ted cruz has you know argued to the
supreme court a number of times and won
i don't think he won every one but he's
won more than he lost
and he is really really good at
communicating
he knows the law at the highest possible
level
and that's what this is about this is
effectively a
supreme court congress e-level
thing and are you glad that ted cruz is
on the job
just just sort of a general compliment
to ted cruz
um you know he's not the only one who
does good work but
you know when i see his name attached to
a topic like this
i feel better because he's
hyper capable in this exact stuff
and i guess the trump administration is
going to sue google
maybe uh maybe today i don't know
or next week or sometime soon um they're
gonna sue them over
uh allegations of uh rigging search
i guess so that's coming
you know so here's something else on cnn
which probably explains why they get
everything wrong
so there was a an opinion article here
uh which they're talking about trump and
he says this entire campaign
is based on triggering a massive
mobilization of his political baseball
uh talks about
talks about masks and stuff and then
it says of trump that as president he
has quote a duty to keep all americans
safe
would you agree to that is it trump's
job as president as cnn says in this
opinion piece
to is it his duty to keep all americans
safe
i don't think it is right
does cnn not know the job description of
the president
because i'm pretty sure that's not his
job description
to keep all americans safe my
understanding
is that his job description is to
balance the interests of americans
right and safety would be one of the
interests
which the president balances if the
president decides in his role as
commander-in-chief to go to war
to protect the country is he trying to
keep all americans safe
no no he's sending the military
into harm's way because all things
considered
that that's going to be our best outcome
of you know imperfect
options no it's not the it's not the
president's job to keep all citizens
safe
it is the president's job to make sure
the constitution is followed
and that our interests are balanced and
one of our interests is freedom
one of our interests is economics
one of our interests is to lead a
quality life
safety is another interest it's
certainly not our only one
and when you see this kind of a take
that it's the president's job to keep
all americans safe
i would say to myself that would explain
why their coverage makes no sense
because if they believe that's actually
the president's job
to keep us all safe
the most impossible thing then
everything they said about the president
wouldn't make sense
because they'd be starting with not
understanding his job
how could they evaluate his job
performance
when they clearly don't know what his
job is it's not his job
and so everything they say about the
coronavirus now makes sense
if they think his job is to keep us all
safe
it would make sense that you would
really go hard at him for wanting to
open up the economy
that all makes sense but if you knew
that his job was to balance our
interests and to obey the constitution
you would say um yeah what he's doing is
right on that target
the president is doing his job
of balancing our interest now you might
say i would have balanced them
differently
that's fair but don't don't tell me it's
not his job to balance our interests
that's that's just wrong all right i
hope you enjoyed
