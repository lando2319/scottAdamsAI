[Music]
hey everybody
come on in it's time it's time for us
god
time for coffee was scott adams i forgot
who i was there for a moment
am i the coffee or am i the guy
well it's all the same thing if you
drink enough coffee you merge
with the beverage and become sort of a
coffee person but not
enough about that let us get to the
important part of the morning the part
that makes everything better
yeah it's called the simultaneous hip
and all you need is a
copper mug or glass a tanker gels or
steiner canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite beverage
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous it happens
now go
oh yeah yeah
so good so in my opinion
the funniest thing that's happening
right now
is that president trump is experiencing
just blistering withering attacks
on you know everything he's ever done
and at the same time
he's been nominated for the nobel peace
prize
now here's the fun part
you it would be easy to imagine that any
president could get
nominated for the nobel peace prize you
know
if you're thinking okay who is who is a
good candidate for the nobel peace prize
and they have to give it every year even
if nobody did anything
you say to yourself well it's it's no
big surprise
that there's somebody in the world who's
willing to nominate the president of the
united states
no matter who the president is there's
always something the president did that
sounds peace like
but what's different is that trump has
the best
case for winning a nobel peace prize
that maybe you've ever seen
it's not just it's not just marginal
that's what's funny about it
it would you know you could imagine a
situation in which
you'd say ah i don't know you know the
things he's done
i suppose you could make a a case for it
being
worthy of the nobel peace prize but
we're not talking about
a gray area here we're talking about the
clearest
case for a nobel peace prize
maybe ever because the beauty of it
is that it's not just the israel
a uae deal
as big as that is it's also that he
managed to get rid of isis he's
pulling troops out of everything he's
the first time in 39 years he didn't
didn't start a war and
you look at uh oh and north korea is
clearly in a better place than it was
um trump is getting you know he gets
he gets criticized for being too
friendly with dictators
but it is exactly why we're not in wars
with those dictators
it's part of the process it's part of an
explicit
strategy which he told us in advance
that he was going to be good to the
leaders of these other countries
whether they deserved it or not because
it would be a good
negotiating position to treat them with
respect and then maybe you can get
something done
and if you look at you know his his
total body of work
it's kind of crazy because even his
critics
are going to have to sort of give it up
for the the international stuff
they might complain bitterly about stuff
at home
but the international stuff is really
really solid
so here's the thing i like to keep
reminding you
if you have a world view or a filter on
life
and you're pretty certain that it's the
right filter and it explains your
reality well
and you think that other people with
different filters on life
don't quite see things clearly the only
way you can settle that
is by prediction whichever those two
filters on reality
consistently predicts what happens next
is you got to think that's the real one
or the one that's closest to truth
all of the people who said president
trump would create
wars and would be completely useless
and international negotiations
how did your prediction go did your
prediction
in let's say 2016 did you predict
that this president would be not just
nominated for a nobel peace prize
of course you know it may be political
in terms of who actually
gets the prize but that there would be
a completely solid and unambiguous case
and really you can't even think of
anybody who would be in second place
it's the most solid case for a nobel
peace prize maybe of all time
yeah oh serbia serbia and kosovo like i
forgot
an entire an entire major component
because he did so many things you know
he just sort of drops these little
these little you know gold eggs as he's
going and you don't realize how many
gold eggs there are until you
until somebody nominates them for a
nobel peace prize and you say
well what's the justification for that
oh well there's that golden egg that's
pretty good
oh here's another one well here's
another one
and suddenly you've got a gigantic
basket full of golden eggs
that you didn't quite realize what kind
of a portfolio he'd put together
for this stuff so anyway my point is
that my world view
expressed often and publicly was that
he definitely would be the kind of
president who would get a nobel peace
prize
so that was my prediction in fact i
predicted it would have happened earlier
i would have thought it would happen in
the first term so
my world view predicted exactly where we
are
on this nobel peace prize nomination
and anybody who thought it was the
opposite you have to now
honestly say to yourself okay my
worldview did not predict
you could still think you don't like the
president for whatever reasons
but you have to admit one of those world
views predicted
perfectly and one of them got it
completely wrong
there's that's some somewhat just
objectively true at this point
all right there's a big story that
i'm going to mention without talking
about
now i wouldn't normally do that but
you'll immediately know why
there's a big story that netflix is
showing some content
that i'm not going to describe even in
general terms
i'm not even going to tell you that the
category it's in
and there are critics who say netflix
should actually go to jail actual
jail not a joke the actual
literally physically take a person
and put them in jail for just running
this content
on netflix now i saw that claim before i
saw the
the clips of the content and of course i
said to myself
that's a little that's a little extreme
you know obviously if it's just going to
be on a family entertainment
platform netflix is you know sort of for
everybody
and that they have you know ratings and
stuff but it's it's a family
entertainment thing
surely they're not going to knowingly
and intentionally
put content on their platform which
and a reasonable person would say um
you should go to jail for that actual
literal jail for putting that on on
a screen and then i looked at the
content
they should actually go to jail for it
now i don't like to even talk about this
content
so you may have noticed i tend to stay
away from it
because it's just so ugly i don't like
to put it in people's heads
but the fact that netflix with impunity
apparently
can put content on there that literally
you should go to jail for
actual literal go to jail
you know and i wouldn't say that about
just about anything
i mean you'd really really have to try
hard
to get somebody who's as you know free
speech oriented and
you know hey let's let's not get too
excited about these little
offenses and violations i mean i'm
always on the side of you're making too
much of this
doesn't matter it doesn't matter if it's
a republican thing or democrat
fairly consistently i'm the one who says
ah you're blowing this out of proportion
not this time not this time you look at
it as an adult and you would say to
yourself somebody needs to go to jail
for this
actual jail it's it's mind-blowing
all right joe biden continues to
to run his campaign in which i guess the
main strategy
besides hiding is to reword
trump's policies into uh angry and
confused old man language but make it a
little more boring
and it sounds like a joke right oh he's
not really running for president by
doing
you know nothing but rewording the
current guy's policies
he couldn't do that could he well what's
his
what's his slogan uh build back better
that really is just make america great
again rewarded
but boring and now now he's
doing a buy america thing trying to
convince people to buy america and
bring the factories back i'm thinking to
myself
in other words exactly what the
president's doing
and then there of course is coronavirus
recommendations from joe biden which are
i
the president should follow the expert's
advice
which is exactly what he's done from day
one
so biden is literally just rewording
what trump
is doing and says he wants to do he's
just rewording it into confused angry
old man language
and selling it amazingly he's selling it
pretty well
all right um one of my best predictions
of all time
which i don't i don't think it will ever
get much attention but in terms of
how accurate it was it's really good
one of my best and it goes like this
when the
when the pandemic first started and
maybe i said this in
february-ish but it was what it was
early on before we knew a lot
and what i said was that
everybody would look back at the
so-called mistakes that our leaders and
experts made
and they will criticize them with the
clarity of what we learn in the future
but it will be completely unfair because
leaders were only guessing in the
beginning
because they didn't have you know really
the knowledge of what to do
and they knew they didn't know they knew
that there were so many unknowns
that they just had to do something
and see if it worked and if it didn't
quickly adjust and try something else
and
learn as you go and so in my effort to
make the world a better place
which looks like it didn't work at all i
tried to
to prepare the room if you will
so i was saying loudly and often when
in a few months from now you're going to
think that
we should have made different decisions
because you'll be smarter in the future
you'll know what worked and what didn't
work and you will be
completely full of because if you
don't know it today
don't tell me in august what we should
have done today
all that matters is what did you know to
do today
how did all the leaders in the world do
in february not so well
not so well because they were all
guessing
were they all bad leaders probably not
were all the leaders in the world of
similar quality
because it seems to me that leaders that
you would think are
bad in general seem to have in many
cases coincidentally
got something that looked like a better
result than some people you might have
thought
well i thought they were pretty good
leaders but they got a bad result
what you will learn and what um
the the fake news is counting on is that
the average person will never be
sophisticated enough
and never have the let's say the talent
stack
to understand how to analyze this
situation
it's hard i would guess that no more
than
two percent of the public would be
anywhere near the capability and this
is not just raw intelligence capability
but experience in analyzing things
that's the important part is the
experience
if you don't have the experience
analyzing complicated situations
you might think you can do it because
you might say to yourself well
i just listened to the news and there
were 10 smart people in the route
who said that president trump made big
mistakes
so what else do i need to know
i looked at the news they seem like
smart people
they all seem to agree that the
president made these mistakes
therefore logically the president did a
poor job
on the coronavirus but here's the
problem
98 of the public doesn't know
how to even analyze this situation so
the 10 experts you
you hear almost certainly are not in
that two percent
and you can tell by looking at the way
they talk about it
and i've gone through this before but
the fast version
is this leadership in the end
will look like the least important
variable in terms of how things turned
out
if you can't do your analysis and adjust
for
hey the united states has a high
population of african americans
and they have a worse outcome in terms
of ultimately dying
from coronavirus did anybody factor that
in
when they said how did the united states
do did they factor in that we have
a high population of unusually
vulnerable people
i didn't see anybody do that have you
ever seen anybody do that
has anybody ever said we're going to
compare you to germany
but we're going to do this calculation
to normalize it so it'd be as if you had
similar populations
and then see how you did have you seen
that
no no you've not seen that
how about obesity gigantic variable
united states has a sadly as a fat
population
we have an unusually obese population
so if you compare us to a country that
doesn't have an obese population
or nowhere near it and you don't do the
math to adjust when you're comparing the
two
have you compared them no
no you haven't compared them so all the
people that you think are the smart
people
who are going on television saying look
at my graph
look at lucitania estonia
look at how lubricated did
look how this state did compared to this
other state
100 of those people are idiots
not in general but on this topic there
are people who
think that because they have a graph
and it's real data that they trust and
the data came from a good source
and they took that good source and they
put it on a graph
they think they know something no
that graph is misleading
it's not telling you something you need
to know it's not
providing information it is reducing
your information
because it's misleading you it mis leads
you into thinking that's enough
to make some kind of a decision it's not
we don't know why some states do do fine
without masks
we don't know why some places seem to
need a shutdown
and other places didn't we don't know
why some
group activities seem to create a bunch
of new coronavirus
and others don't we don't know exactly
what
anything is doing right it's just you
know big
ball of guessing and i can guarantee you
this that all of the leaders of all of
the countries
said some version of this early on in
the pandemic
this feels like a very comfortable thing
to to assume is true
without you know without knowing and
talking to every person
don't you think that every leader said
to themselves pandemic
virology epidemiology
i don't know anything about that stuff
right
so there might there might be a few
world leaders who are also doctors but
in general
don't you think your putin's your she's
your
your miracles everybody
for the most part you know generally
speaking don't you think they all said
uh i'd better just listen to the experts
with me so far that all of the all of
the leaders said this isn't my domain
i'd better listen to the experts then
the experts
would you also agree we're largely on
the same page
worldwide because the experts were
really good
at sharing information the internet
allows that
and so the experts everywhere
fairly soon i mean not in day one but
fairly soon they re
they achieve something like a consensus
so
all the world leaders looked at the
experts
looked at the consensus and said all
right
we could be right or we could be wrong
but it's never going to be wrong
to do what the consensus of experts say
in terms of
a rational decision it's never wrong it
could be wrong in terms of the outcome
because again even the experts were
taking their best shot at it
they were legitimately you know honestly
and professionally giving us their best
work
but they had to guess a little bit right
you can't fault them if they got
something wrong
because it wasn't possible to know what
was right it just wasn't possible
so there's my take that only the people
who don't know how to analyze things
think that they can look at president
trump's performance
and say well that could have been better
and of course there's always the the
fact that anything that's good
could have been done sooner right
now the president's getting uh the the
big fake news of the day
last 48 hours i guess is the idea that
if the president
had acted sooner a hundred thousand
people would be saved
now is that true number one
we don't know that's a complete unknown
so anybody who says if he had acted
sooner a hundred thousand people would
have been saved
there's no evidence of that there's no
evidence of that at all
do you know what evidence they use
somebody ran a model
what what credibility do you give
somebody's complicated prediction model
none right if we've learned anything
it's that complicated prediction models
are not really credible so all the
people saying oh there's a model that
says 100 000 people or whatever would
have lived if he had acted sooner
a everybody could have acted sooner b
nobody knew what to do uh
c fauci says
and i don't think he would lie about
this fouchy says that the president did
whatever
the experts collectively said he should
do and when they said it
he didn't even delay he did it when they
said
things should be done so
your uh your situation is that
um it's really it's some combination of
lying
and not knowing how to analyze things so
there's some people saying the president
did a bad job
who know they're lying because it can't
be determined one way or the other
and there are other people who just
don't know they they think it's just a
fact
because they don't know how to analyze
things all right
so and and it you can see how crazy
things get
because woodward got some criticism
for if he learned during this telephone
interview
back whenever it was if he learned that
trump
knew it was more dangerous than he had
said
shouldn't woodward be telling people you
know shouldn't he immediately blow the
whistle and say up
i was gonna say this for a book but it's
so important
i need to tell the public because
otherwise a hundred thousand people will
die
do you know what woodward said he said
that's nonsense
in other words the people who are
believing woodward's book
are holding in their mind these two
things to be true which can't both be
true
that if the president had told the
public that it was a big problem
and they would take it more seriously we
could have saved a bunch of lives
but if the president told woodward
and woodward told the president and even
had it on tape
so you don't even have to wonder if it's
being mischaracterized it's on tape
if woodward had given it to the public
it would not have made any difference
those two things can't both be true
you have to pick either woodward killed
tens of thousands of people by sitting
on it or
the president didn't kill tens of
thousands of people
by sitting on it in other words nobody
knew what to do
you know you could always second guess
after you have better information
all right
one big persuasion mistake democrats are
making
and i don't know if it could be avoided
is that dumping all of these
anti-trump books at the same time i
think there are three more anti-trump
books that are going to hit the next
few weeks if you have too many
anti-trump books
the audience gets snow blind meaning
that they
they all feel they start feeling the
same
and if they all start feeling the same
they also feel less important
because here's a memory trick from the
book um
from the book guy's name i can't
remember but
the trick is this that memory is
triggered by contrast
so if there was a if you only had one
book
and has said terrible things about the
president people would really notice
that
and they'd be like whoa well that's a
big deal i don't know if it's true or
not but
i can't stop thinking about this book
and i would say the michael wolff book
was closer
to that right the michael wolf book if
you remember that
sort of was by itself for a while so it
really stood out and became a major news
thing
but if you have six books that all make
sketchy claims and inevitably some of
those claims in those books will be
debunked
if some of them are debunked and and the
whole audience says
okay that one's debunked but what about
these other ones
there's still it's just not interesting
it's just a big
wall of anti-trump books that in your
mind
just got put in one bucket and then you
ignored it
so i think the books will have less
impact
than maybe democrats hope in part
because there are too many of them
and they they dilute each other all
right
um so here's the most interesting part
i i often tell you that i think i'm
watching the news just like a spectator
and then all of a sudden the news is
about me
and i say wait a minute wait a minute
i'm supposed to be watching the news
why is the news about me and that
happened again yesterday
so the woodward book part of the
promotion of it is
i guess he's dropping some of the audio
tapes of the
interviews and they're getting turned
into transcripts and articles
and one of them was his interview
woodward's interview
with jared kushner and jared kushner
told him that to understand president
trump there were
four books that woodward should read
that really give you the the complex
picture of who president trump is
now one of those books was the wizard no
i'm sorry the
alice in wonderland and specifically the
cheshire
cat and i had to remind myself
what's the cheshire cat's deal i know
he's got a big smile and he disappears
but i didn't know i don't remember much
more and i so i read a description of
him and the cheshire cat is described as
mischievous smiley and mischievous
i thought okay yeah that's actually
if you understand that the cheshire cat
is mischievous
you can say okay that is definitely
president trump right
you know he likes a little mischief he
doesn't it's not an
accident that he creates mischief
non-stop
you know it's not like he can't stop
doing it or maybe he can't
but you know that that definitely is a
pretty good description of them
but that's not the whole person right
and
and that would be jared's point that
you'd have to read four different
books to look in four different windows
to understand what the interior of the
house looks like
so so that's one cheshire cat alice in
wonderland
but one of the other books was my book
win bigly
now win bigly the primary theme of it is
that the president
is a master persuader and uses the tools
of persuasion to great
effect how did woodward
categorize my book now remember the
the murray gel man effect the amnesia
effect
i talk about it too much the idea that
there was this physicist who noted that
when he saw a story in the press
about his specialty he could tell it was
wrong
because it's his specialty but the
moment he would read a story about
something else like
the palestinian situation or anything
else he would uncritically read it as if
it's probably right
even though when he reads articles that
he knows the
the content or he knows the field he
knows they're wrong
and they're universally wrong
likewise uh if you didn't know any
better and you're
listening you're looking at woodward
describe these books he described my
book
as uh dis as characterizing the
president as
manipulative that's a word i never used
and in fact i went to payne's to make
sure i didn't do that
so the one thing i can fact check the
only thing
i can personally check and i can know
with complete certainty
is wrong coincidentally
coincidentally the only area that i'm an
expert in which is the book i wrote
i know that he characterized it wrong i
mean as wrong as you could characterize
it
now do i now say well the
one thing i could fact check personally
was wrong
but i'll bet all that other stuff was
good
[Laughter]
i used to think stuff like that not
anymore
now now i know that the odds of me
catching that one little thing that was
the wrong
you know a wrong characterization it's
probably
all wrong characterizations you know
there's no reason to believe any of us
right
so here's my definition of manipulation
versus
persuasion now this is sort of a
personal
uh personal take on it but i think it
works
persuasion this is just my own
take on it is when you're persuading
somebody
who wants to be persuaded
or at least is no worse off for it for
example if you're a car
salesperson and your the customer comes
in
the customer knows that the car
salesperson is persuading them
they know that but it's also very
transparent every part of the technique
is pretty well known to everybody
but it doesn't feel like manipulation
exactly it feels like persuasion it
feels
feels like sales it's a little icky
but you want the car and on some level
you kind of want to get talked into it
right i mean when you got to buy a car
you
kind of want to be talked into it
because you
in many cases you've decided just for
emotional reasons and now you need
somebody to tell you you were smart
so that would be persuasion where you're
not worse off
if you know unless the salesperson is
just a criminal
they're just being persuasive they're
not manipulating you per se
but manipulation would be a different
situation and again this is just my
version of it
manipulation would be where the person
is doing it has something to gain
and the person who's having it done to
them has something to lose
so if it's a win-lose situation that's
manipulation
the president again in my view
doesn't do that one he doesn't do
manipulation in the context of
of the presidency and running for the
presidency what he does is persuasion
so if he tries to persuade you for
example that there should be a wall in
the southern border
he's not doing it to screw you right
you could disagree whether that's a good
idea or a bad idea
but i think you'd all agree
that he's not doing it to screw you
if you're an american citizen he's doing
it to help you so if he persuades you
to get a wall to fund a wall
are you worse off you could be worse off
in the sense that maybe you don't like
that policy
but it's not because there was bad
intent
it's only manipulation if you have some
evil intention
if you have a good intention but it
requires you to persuade people to get
it done
you could be right or you could be wrong
but it's still good intentions
and that's persuasion so
i would say woodward's characterization
of my book as
calling the president manipulative is
just flat out wrong
i don't write it that way at all all
right
um
there's another fake news today eddie
zipper
uh tweeted about this you probably saw
the news
there is some version of this uh it said
that
uh i think the hill reports it this way
they said trump said that he didn't have
responsibility to understand
pain of black americans and then they
give this quote
no i don't feel that at all now
when i first heard this story and i saw
the president's
quote i said to myself oh
i know how they do this fake news
there's some context
that they're leaving out it was obvious
by the quote
that it had been taken out a context and
once you see enough things taken out of
context
especially when it happens to you you
know if you're the person the story is
about
which has been the case for me in a lot
of cases you can tell when something's
taken out of context
as soon as i saw this i was like oh
they just created some fake news by
taking this out of context
the reason i knew it was out of context
is they didn't tell you
what trump said immediately after it
and they also didn't tell you exactly
what came before it
and i said to myself i'll betcha if i
heard what came before that
or i heard what came after it i would
have a completely different opinion on
this
wake up in the morning eddie zipperer on
twitter says in his tweet this is a flat
out lie
because the question was quote do you
have any sense
that that privilege meaning the white
privilege has isolated you and put you
in a cave to a certain extent
and that's what trump was saying no no
way
now i would disagree with trump
i would say that being the president
guarantees that you're taken out of the
normal flow of life
right yeah i don't criticize you know
bush was a bush senior who said he
didn't know what a loaf of bread cost
that's fine i don't have any problem
with the president
not knowing what a loaf of bread costs
everybody understands that the
presidency is not like life
it's a completely bubble situation so i
don't think
uh i don't think trump is accurate in
saying that
you know he can understand to somebody
else's situation nobody can understand
anybody's situation
but from a politician's perspective
it would be fair to say i do understand
other people's situation
because you want to say that you you
know you can relate to him in some way
so i don't think his answer was out of
lines in terms of the
what you'd expect from a political
entity
but his answer
looks completely different if you know
what the setup is
so that's just fake news created by
intentionally bad editing
all right um
nicholas kristoff writes in the new york
times that
quality of life in the united states
according to some
social progress measure has dropped over
the last decade
even while it's risen in other places
and now we're
28th in the world in terms of
how good we're doing quality of
life-wise now here's what's interesting
the article did not speculate or give
any evidence
of what it is that's causing our lower
quality of life
what does that tell you it
is is it sort of conspicuously missing
from a story
if you say the u.s quality of life has
dropped
and there are no reasons even speculated
it would be one thing not to know
but it seems like what would be required
in a story like this
is experts don't know exactly why
but they they mentioned looking at these
areas to see you know maybe this is why
but it's just completely left out
right what what do you make of the fact
that no reasons are even even mentioned
even
in casual speculation here's what i make
of it
it it's awkward meaning that the reason
we're doing poorly
might have to do with i'll just pick one
example
the teachers unions do you think the new
york times would write
well it looks like the teachers unions
are destroying america
not completely by themselves but a
pretty big part of it
no no probably not now i don't want to
make an accusation
or read minds of nicholas kristoff that
would be unfair
so i'm not going to make any there's no
negative statement about him
but would the new york times ever say
the reason that things are going
backwards is because of
liberal policies they can't
if the problem that was driving us
backwards in
quality of life were even maybe
even maybe related to the political
right
would it be in the article if if you
could even come up with
just a hand waving reason why this lower
quality of
life was because of conservatives
don't you think that would be in the
article i mean it's
it's so conspicuously missing
you've got to ask yourself why all right
the the worst take on this whole
coronavirus and how the president did
is i'm hearing people say some version
of this
the public could handle the truth so the
president should have just told us the
truth
as opposed to trying to calm our fears
it's not the leader's job to calm our
fears we're adults
just tell us the situation and we'll
decide what to do
i think that's the worst take because
that's not what leaders do
and i'll give you you know another
version of this from lawrence tribe
you know him from a professor at harvard
and a
big hillary clinton fan and a big hater
of the president
he's fairly famous as a critic of the
president now remember he's a harvard
guy
highly educated and here's what he says
um he says about trump
uh oh well he quotes trump saying i'm
the leader of the country i can't be
jumping up and down and scaring people
and that's trump told sean hannity that
i don't want to scare people
i don't want people not to panic and
that's exactly what i did
and that lawrence tribe calls him out
for that
calls down trump and says this from the
guy who screams about carnage in the
suburbs
now the implication here is that the
president is getting people
uh not scared enough about the virus
and that's inconsistent because he's
getting us
too scared about carnage in the suburbs
which
i take within the cup within the context
i take to mean
that lawrence tribe thinks that's not a
big risk here's what's
completely bad about this take
it is exactly the leader's job
to dial up and dial down how scared we
are or concerned we are about topics
that is exactly a leader's job in fact
maybe more central to the job of a
leader than
anything else they do is telling the
people they're leading
how much to worry about this versus that
and you don't treat everything with the
same amount of worry
nor would you be a good leader if you
treated the amount of worry
by the number of deaths or the number of
deaths you could predict
or the number of deaths that have
already happened that's not how things
work
here's how leadership works if you think
the public is not worrying
enough about something you ramp up their
worry
so that they'll put more effort into it
if you think people could panic
and maybe do a run on the stores and run
on ppe
and there's nothing good that could come
from it only bad could come from it
nothing good
then maybe that's a situation where you
want to dial it down
so for larry lawrence tribe
to act as though the leader of the
country
should treat different situations
with the same amount of concern that's
the opposite of a leader
the president should treat every
situation
like its own thing and then say are you
worried enough
if not i'll raise it or are you worried
too much
and that's causing trouble in that case
i'll lower it that's what leaders do
that's the whole job now this guy
lawrence tribe is teaching children
you know college kids but
um now and let me reiterate
in the my book loser think i introduced
the idea that
the amount of raw intelligence you have
doesn't really help you in many cases
unless you also have a good exposure to
different fields
and lawrence tribes case he may just be
a partisan
so he knows he's saying something stupid
and he doesn't care if it works
so you can't read his mind so you don't
know what he's thinking but
it could also be that he's a brilliant
legal scholar who doesn't understand
how leadership works because he's not
teaching
i don't think he's teaching any mba
classes he's teaching the law
so i think it's just a gap in his
understanding i'll give him the benefit
of a doubt
um
the the news is so insane now it's
almost hard to wrap your head around it
but there's video of uh trump talking to
jim acosta
in march and the march part is the
important part
and which trump is saying directly
and as clearly as you possibly could
that he is purposely trying to
uh downplay the the pandemic
because he doesn't want to panic the
country if there's no good in that
in other words if there's no upside from
panicking in the country
but there definitely would be a downside
he doesn't want to have the downside
so in march he's saying it in public in
the most public way you could
a press conference of the president of
the united states to cnn's
primary guy extended conversation on
this topic
very clear and then when the woodward
book comes out
let's say march april may
june july august
six months later the press
acts as though it's the first time
they've heard
that the president is intentionally
downplaying the risk
and and gives his reasons why
how do we sit here and and watch these
idiots
pretend that this was somehow new
information
when it was the most public thing the
president ever did
when i first heard the the woodward
thing i thought uh
that fat this feels like not only not
new news but the oldest news you could
possibly have
i it felt to me like march news
when i heard it the first time and it
wasn't until i saw the actual
video that i saw this morning i tweeted
it so you can see it too
that i realized just how exactly exactly
and publicly trump had said the same
thing to the public
if you say it to the public in public as
the president
should the public be surprised that he's
giving us the cheery version of things
um
as joel pollock pointed out in a tweet
today
i guess uh joe biden had claimed that
over 6 000
military people had died from the
coronavirus
the actual number is seven
so we missed that by a little bit not so
much
six thousand as it is seven people
now the funny thing about this is that
you can add it to the body of joe biden
lies
now you could argue that
the trump number of fact-checking
problems is greater than the number of
joe biden lies
maybe but are they the same type
that's the part that the news never
tells you when trump
does let's call it uh let's say he does
something that the fact checkers say is
false
lots of times it's hyperbole that you
recognize
like oh okay trump said that uh this has
never happened
this before have you not watched
enough politics to know that doesn't
literally necessarily mean it's never
happened before this well
it just doesn't mean that if if you're
so unsophisticated
that you ever believed it to be
literally true
at some point you just have to look at
yourself and say
uh okay i got fooled 20 000 times in a
row
but i think this one's exactly meant to
be accurate
no 20 000 times in a row
should alert you to a pattern which is
if the president says
i've done the best in this in a hundred
years
then maybe it's not a hundred years
maybe he did a really good job
and maybe it's the best in ten years
which would still be terrific
but if you don't understand that he
always talks like that about everything
you shouldn't even be in the
conversation you should just
quietly close your twitter account and
just sneak away
because if you haven't figured out this
pattern yet you're not really at the
adult table yet
but the same people who say uh 20 000
fact-checking problems with the
president
will look at joe biden basing his
campaign on the biggest lie in american
politics the find people hoax also
pushing the
trump uh trump suggested drinking bleach
one of the most debunked hoaxes of all
time
and then you know this claim about the
military stuff basically
there are probably dozens and dozens of
major claims that biden has made that
are clearly and unambiguously
untrue so anybody who says i don't like
this
president trump lying business so i'd
better go to
joe biden you're the dumbest people in
the game
now i can i would acknowledge that you
could make
a legitimate argument for why you like
either of these candidates
you know i have a preference but i think
a reasonable smart person could say
uh you know here are my priorities this
is why i think that
you know joe biden with all of his flaws
still better than trump
a reasonable person could have that
opinion it's not my opinion but a
reasonable person could have it
here's what's not a reasonable opinion
i'm going to vote for the guy who
doesn't lie
i mean that's just i don't even know
what to call that
if you haven't noticed that joe biden
lies
again you probably shouldn't vote if you
haven't noticed that
all right sometimes you might wonder
are the hosts on cnn a good people who
sometimes get things wrong
that would be the best case scenario
right that these cnn hosts
are are trying as hard as they can to
give you
the real news but like everything some
people make mistakes you get some stuff
wrong
that's that's life or are they
intentionally lying to you
in a way that is awful
and i think we got an answer to that
because
if you you'll see the clip i also
tweeted this today
in which uh anderson cooper and sanjay
gupta are talking about the
virus early on and they're talking about
it as being no more
dangerous than the regular flu
now i completely get how it is
newsworthy
to say the president downplayed this
early on
and he should have he should have been
more concerned about it
but if you're cnn and you did exactly
that
exactly that and it's on video and
we can all look at it you can look at it
today i just tweeted it
and you see anderson cooper talking to
sanjay gupta
now again i do not criticize them
for being wrong in march
because i don't criticize anybody for
being wrong
early on remember that was my rule and
i'm going to stick to it
so anderson cooper was not wrong
sanjay guptu was not wrong when they
said hey it looks like it's no worse
than the flu
we should be more worth you know they
weren't wrong in the sense of
being irresponsible because everybody
was guessing
the experts were i think genuinely
trying their best
you knew that a lot of people were going
to get it wrong
i don't hold it against them but from
today's perspective
if they're holding it against this is
the major piece of news on cnn
the biggest piece of news is that
they're holding it against the president
for telling the public the wrong message
early on
it's the same message they told the
public early on
the same one if you don't include that
in the story
yeah we're criticizing the president but
if we're being honest
man did we do exactly the same thing the
president really messed up on this
just like we did here's a video of us
making the same mistake
you know got it got to be transparent
nobody's perfect
wish we hadn't done it in hindsight it
looks like a mistake
at the time we didn't know any better
just like the president
let us show you how nobody knew what was
the right answer
in march that would have been fine
but to simply act like that didn't
happen and that the president was the
only one who was wrong in march
or february that
is just evil
you can't say that anderson cooper is a
good person
a good human being because that that is
so clearly a case
of despicable moral conduct
in in public that i could not have less
respect for that
really and again i would be perfectly
okay with them if they were simply
wrong and now they've you know they know
why it was wrong and they talk about it
in context
no problem completely forgiven
for being wrong but today
you know you were wrong today how about
a little transparency
or else you were just being you're just
being really
there's it's hard to say it any other
way
and so there's uh some news out of
michigan
that the biden is up in michigan which
would be pretty important right one of
the battleground states
so and i think rasmussen is showing that
biden is up
eight points or something six or eight
points something like that
and that's a lot but i saw an analysis
by bruce
stanford all right on twitter i don't
know who bruce is but i'll just give him
credit because this is a real good
analysis
and he says that although biden is
clearly headed in the polls
here's the experience in michigan in
2016
and 2018. so we've seen this the
most two recent elections same
experience and it goes like this
every undecided vote went to trump
or to republicans in the case of the
2018 midterm election
let me say that again every undecided
vote
went to the republicans okay
and i want to make sure that you heard
that right in michigan
in 2016 and 2018 every
undecided vote went to the republicans
now i don't think it was every vote it
must have been just most of them
but uh the point the point stands if you
take out the absolute part
there there had to be some exceptions
but
what does that tell you about shy trump
voters
yeah the the way this is shaping up
uh and yeah i i suppose i could be wrong
right you know it's
it's easy to be blindsided and and think
you're right
and you know dunning krueger and all
that so
let me tell you that i'm completely
aware that i could be very confident in
my prediction
and my rightness and be wrong you know
it wouldn't be that big of a
it wouldn't be a shocker in the world of
you know strange events
but this looks like a gigantic blowout
shaping up it looks gigantic
i could be wrong but it's sure looking
like
the president's got a you've got a
victory here coming up
all right those are the things i wanted
to talk about today
yeah the the vote by mail stuff
the fact that the the mainstream press
is
trying to gaslight us if you want to use
that term
it's the wrong term but they use it a
lot uh the mainstream
press wants us to think that it's crazy
to think
that mail-in voting could be
could be illegitimate because it's
already been done in
states for years etc some states
but this is again just being bad at
analyzing things
the thing that you should say is what's
different about 2020
from any other situation in which we had
mail in votes
and what's different is the incentive to
cheat
is through the roof you know if there is
a penalty for cheating
on voting and people don't really care
too much who wins it's like yeah i
prefer this candidate
but it's not the end of the world if the
other one wins
in that case you would expect a little
bit of cheating
because there's just not that much to
gain but there might be a few people who
think they have something to gain
but when you talk about trump in 2020
the press has hypnotized the masses into
thinking there's a
hitler in charge and it's the end of
civilization
if if you thought that the alternative
to cheating at the election box or
cheating on a mail-in vote
if you thought the alternative to
cheating was the destruction of
civilization
would you be tempted i hope so
i if you're a good person and you think
that you could change or alter the
course of history
and that you could save a civilization
from being destroyed
which is the claim of the mainstream
press basically
wouldn't you cheat it's the same the
same question of
if you thought an actual hitler had come
to power in the united states
and you could personally kill him you
know like you could be the assassin
don't you have a responsibility to do it
you know if if the badness is bad enough
you're forgiven you're forgiven for
whatever you do about it
because the badness is so bad that you
would be allowed to do bad things to get
rid of the bigger bad
so here's my here's my
i guess the bottom line is that the
people who are bad at comparing things
are going to act like 2020 is just like
any other
election people don't care that much who
gets elected yeah we have a preference
but we don't care that much
no that was gore versus bush
gore versus bush people had a preference
but not that much trump versus biden
oh that's not the same that is not the
same
because nobody really thought that if
gore got elected versus bush
getting elected it was the end of
civilization
nobody thought that but with trump they
have been hypnotized to believe that's
an
actual real world risk so
that and the fact that we don't have any
baseline to know what
mail-in votes should look like in any
given county
because we've never had a coronavirus
we've never had trump running for
re-election
we've we've never had a press that was
this illegitimate
we've never had anything like 2020. so
anybody who tells you history tells us
the history with those several states
that have been doing mail-in votes
and the history with a different kind of
mail-in vote which is where you request
it which is much safer anybody who tells
you that those two histories
or the fact that there was a commission
that looked into
those histories and that those histories
are telling you what's going to happen
in 2020 which has
nothing to do with the situation that
was common
to those histories anybody who tells you
that
that analysis makes sense is either a
liar
or doesn't know how to analyze things
it's hard to tell which
so that
is what we've got did you see the the
latest joe biden gaffes
oh my god i don't know how anybody can
look at those videos
i'm not sure how often the people on the
left even see the the biden gaff videos
but i don't know how you could look at
any of those
and think he's ready i think it was a
joe rogan who did the analogy
that recently that biden was like a
flashlight that was low on batteries and
you were taking it on a long hike at
night
and you're just getting like a little
yellow glow out of your your flashlight
and you're thinking
this might be a bad idea maybe i won't
take a
long hike at night with a flashlight
with a dying battery
all right that's all i got for now and i
will
talk to you later
