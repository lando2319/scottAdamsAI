do do
good morning everybody and welcome
to the greatest thing that's ever
happened in the history of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
aren't you lucky to be here
to enjoy it and if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels that only
SpaceX has ever seen
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of Tankard chalice or Stein a kimteen
joker flaska vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
daily the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go
yeah that was good
that was good
well uh would you like to see the
Dilbert comic that's running on the
locals platform
after it's been canceled
to see what kind of jokes I would do
after I'm canceled
do you think they get edgier
well you're just beginning to see the
beginning of it because I still had some
in the pipeline when I got canceled so
some of the ones you've seen are the
uncanceled version
that they would have brought in
newspapers but here's one that
definitely would not have run in
newspapers
and it features Dave the engineer
talking to the boss
now Dave's a new character a black
engineer
whose main characteristic is that you
you can never tell if he's joking about
wokeness because he's he's very woke but
you're not really sure if he's serious
so that's what his personality is the
boss says Dave if your project is late
what's the problem
Dave turns around and says according to
critical race Theory the problem is you
boss says are you sure
and Dave says that's what the smart
people tell me
now
there was no way I could run that in
newspapers you know that right no
newspaper would have run that and in
fact every comic this week this coming
week will be a comic that could not run
in newspapers every one of them so if
you're wondering when it would get
spicier
well your wait is over
by the way I don't Target anybody or you
know do anything you know racially
insensitive or anything like that I just
do things that wouldn't be in newspapers
there's nothing hateful or or
inappropriate about any of it it's just
those topics were out of bounds
well here's a weird story to start you
off
did you see the video of The Dalai Lama
and a young boy
so the young boy came up to the Dalai
Lama at some public event and said can I
hug you
and the Dalai Lama said yes but you know
first give me a give me a kiss right
there on his cheek a little boy gives
him a cheek and they says uh give me
another kiss on my lips
now at this point I'm saying to myself
huh
maybe uh maybe a cultural difference
possibly a cultural difference I don't
want to judge it
because it might be just a cultural
Oddity
something I'm not familiar with with the
Tibetans perhaps
so the little boy gives him a kiss on
the lips
and then the Dalai Lama says and I swear
I'm not making this up
the Dalai Lama sticks down his tongue
and ask the little boy to
suck on his tongue
I'm not making it up I'm not making it
up
this is actual real news
and do you know do you know what the
media's uh
reaction to that was
[Laughter]
what did the media say
they didn't know what to do the the
media was just
I I think we'll just
describe it this time
I I don't think we're going to weigh in
with an opinion on this one I think
we'll just describe it
yes it's exactly what you thought it was
I don't know how you would interpret
this any other way than that you
wouldn't want the Dalai Lama around your
kids am I right
I would not leave the Dalai Lama around
my kids
that's all I know for sure
anything else would be pure speculation
I'm just saying I wouldn't leave them
around my kids
yeah now
can somebody Fill Me In
is the Dalai Lama allowed to have a sex
life
or is he like a Catholic priest
he's not allowed to have a sex life
huh
has anybody ever noticed what happens to
heterosexuals when he put him in jail
and they can't have a heterosexual sex
life has anybody told you what happens
well they become gay while they're in
jail
because they take what they can get
how are we surprised that people who are
not allowed a heterosexual sex life
would devolve to whatever is available
it's the most well-demonstrated male
effect in the world
that matter unusually flexible once
there are other options run out
I mean if you said you didn't see it
coming
I would say you should have you should
have seen this coming
yeah the Dalai Lama seems to be
associated with Democrats and so if a
Democrat tells a young boy to suck his
tongue
that apparently is just a news that you
describe nothing wrong with that that's
just some news according to the
Democrats
all right apparently there is a thing
called corporate equality index have you
ever heard of that
so you got your CRT and your ESG and
your Dei
but apparently you also have the CEI
now if I can make one request
don't Google the letter CEI don't do it
trust me don't do it
no don't do it no do not Google the
letters CEI you're not going to like it
or you might I don't know
stop it stop doing it don't do it
it means something else
um and the theory here is that the
reason these big corporate entities like
Budweiser
are doing things which may be to you
look like bad marketing
such as the Dylan Mulvaney situation
with Bud Light you might say that's bad
marketing but really what's happening is
these big companies have to get their
CEI score
I'm sorry it's hard for me to act like
an adult sometimes they try to get their
CEI score up
I'm sorry this is just for me
this is just for my benefit now
um so I guess most of the big companies
have a good 100 percent
see ice corner
so good for them
but apparently uh this is yet another
example
where entities can run big corporations
so a big Corporation
a big corporation
uh doesn't run itself anymore
it waits for these little interest
groups to start pestering it and then it
does whatever has to do to stop getting
pestered so now they have an ESG score a
CEI score
probably a Dei score
it's all you know CRT is sort of you
know beneath a lot of that
and don't you think we've gone too far
does it look like we took a good idea
and ruined it
foreign
pretty much all of the wokeness falls
into the following category
in my opinion
good ideas
that are implemented the way a Dilbert
company would Implement something
it's a terribly good idea to say hey
let's treat each other as you know
individuals let's not discriminate let's
not be bigoted great idea
and then you create all these little
organizations and you just make
everything worse
because you're you're putting a a boot
on capitalism you're making them hire
people that they didn't didn't want to
hire because they were looking for a
talent and not diversity
and they're basically ruining uh the
free market
that's not too strong a statement is it
they're actually destroying the free
market the engine upon which all of our
all of our happiness depends completely
if you destroy the free market engine
and they are
you're going to be in trouble
and Who We Are
all right so that's crazy stuff
um
but I think that we're missing one kind
of three-letter
outside measurement I believe that we
now need one for straight white males
so there should be a there should be
like a grade that you give big companies
for how they treat straight white males
because if you're if you're a member of
the LGBT community
the C CEI rating is apparently exactly
what you need
um and it doesn't mean what you think it
means if you look up a CEI don't do that
so
what would be wrong with having a
straight white straight white man grade
for these corporations
would that be
that's not illegal is it
is it illegal
because wouldn't you want to know that
if if you were a straight white man
wouldn't you want to know what companies
did not work for
apparently you know three quarters of
the top 20 Fortune 500 companies have a
hundred percent lgbtq CEI score
but suppose you said who it looks like
they're gonna definitely favor the lgbtq
people for promotion
wouldn't you want to know to avoid them
uh looks like the comments are broken
again on locals
I don't want to curse
but it's really going to be hard
oh my
wreaking God can this technology get any
 worse all right they couldn't do
it
all right it looks like maybe
nope looks like the comments are broken
at least they're not coming through I
don't know if you can see the comments
but I can't see them
all right
yeah there's a new version I think
that's part of it
all right well I'll carry on without
locals comments
oh now I'm gonna actually I'm gonna
close it and reopen it
see if that helps
just so disturbing that I can't get
through this without a major technical
hiccup every time
and now it's just not working
sorry YouTube
sorry you have to put up with this
but you do have good servers over there
on YouTube
and now it looks like
the stream is dead itself
I don't know if they can see me but it's
dead on my side I'll try it one more
time
seriously I'll try it one more time
all right one more time
let's see
yeah it looks like it's totally Dead all
right well we're gonna press on with
just YouTube and we'll pretend like
locals Works which apparently doesn't
um today anyway looks like they've got a
new version that just crapped out
all right let's talk about
um
anyway did anybody disagree with me on
having a score for big corporations for
a straight white men
that's a good idea right
there's no reason not to
so I'm going to give Bud Light a score
of 50 out of 100.
50 out of 100.
all right
so I continue to be fascinated by the
George Soros story
and of course I've been asking people
can you tell me what his motive is
like what is George soros's motive for
the money he donates which appeared to
many of us to be a huge mistake at least
for the United States because it does
stuff like get elected DA's who don't
put people in jail and then your city
becomes a crime infested you know harass
nest and then you have to move away
so here are the many many reasons that
people gave me why they're sure that
George Soros is
doing bad things intentionally
one theory is that
in his childhood
he was protected by the Nazis because
when he was a kid he helped them
round up the Jews or do something
or at least identify the assets owned by
Jews
during World War II so some people say
it must be some kind of a
an effect from his childhood where he's
really kind of racist and kind of a Nazi
so this Theory says that he's a Jewish
Nazi
now here's here's your tip for spotting
a
here's your tip for spotting a mass
Hysteria
one way to spot a mass hysteria is that
there are lots of different
interpretations of what's going on oh
locals just
almost came to life
um
so do you think it's likely that what's
going on is that George Soros is
actually identifying with Nazis and
that's why he's trying to destroy the
Free World
does that make sense to you
that doesn't really quite fit with me
I'm going to say that one's probably not
right here's another one he wants to
create chaos to make money
so in other words he's trying to crash
the United States but he'll make
Financial bets against the United States
so he'll make money if we go down
do you think that he wants to crash the
economy of the country he lives in
as do his children
now no no that would be crazy
if you said he was trying to crash some
country where he doesn't live I would
say well he's done that before he's
tried that before but has he ever tried
to crash the country he depends on for
his own life
that would be crazy
so but maybe he's crazy
how about
um
he wants to usher in globalism
and it's really about globalism and open
borders what do you think of that
that the reason he wants prosecutors who
don't put enough people in jail is
because he wants globalism and open
borders
I don't even see how they're connected
how are they even connected
what is globalism and open orders got to
do with bad district attorneys
that doesn't sound like an explanation
to me
how about uh
that uh he's he's evil and that the
answer is demons
that he that there's no explanation
you can forget about intentions you can
forget about everything else he is just
an evil demon and the world has some
evil demons and they're satanic and they
just walk among us and do evil things
what about that one
now that's a bad explanation of the Mike
cernovich view on it which he tweeted
yesterday I think that it was just a
case of evil
now I do think that that filter on life
can be useful
than just some things are evil because
you don't want to argue about the
reasons for stuff right
um yeah you don't want to you don't want
to have to argue about well he seems to
be acting evil but maybe he has a reason
maybe it's just better to call it evil
and then you know what to do about it
but I don't have that filter right
that's more of a religious filter so
that one doesn't fit me so well so that
one doesn't work for me but I understand
how it could be useful
um now I think that you do need to know
his motivation
because if you don't know his motivation
you don't know what's happening or why
you don't know if there'll be more of it
and you don't know if you can stop it
right if he's just evil then there's
nothing you can do short of something
illegal
but here's my follow-up question
um according to Elon Musk who weighed in
on this question on Twitter
and he said that it's his understanding
that the son of Soros is the de facto
head of the group so in other words you
would have to believe that the father
was either a secret Jewish Nazi
seems unlikely
but that he also extended that down to
his son
and that his son who did not live
through the the situation that George
Soros did somehow also became a Jewish
Nazi
I don't think that's likely
that doesn't sound likely to me or how
about uh Soros is just crazy
well unless he passed the craziness down
to his son
that doesn't make sense because you've
got two complete different individuals
who appear to be following the same plan
so it's not crazy evil demons unless
both of them are
which you couldn't rule out right if if
you have the demon filter well two
demons demons give birth to other demons
I suppose now I don't buy that filter
and to me is very curious that there
would be two completely different
individuals one son and one father who
would have the same weird destructive
impulses
like what explains that
I'm going to give you my theory in a
minute
but
um when I asked well what's the Sutton's
motivation
Elon came back in a second time
I said which moves the question to his
son's motivation why would the son of
Soros want to make America unlivable
because it feels like Soros money is
making America unlivable because the
cities are impossible because of crime
because of the DA's he got in office Etc
and so
um
this is what Elon said to that in terms
of why the sun's motivation would be so
similar he says beats me some amount of
Ivory Tower or pseudo-intellectualism is
probably to blame
Ivory Tower
pseudo-intellectualism in other words
they came up with a theory that the
thing that they're doing is actually
good for the country
it just in reality is not
does that sound right
that is very close to or if not
identical to my hypothesis
and here's the first thing I'd like to
point out
don't you assume that people like Elon
Musk
know the actual reason for Stuff
like you and I are just sort of guessing
well we're looking at these people we're
guessing but don't you assume
there's somebody in Elon musk's position
would have your preferred knowledge
about other billionaires
and that he would know exactly why Soros
is doing what he's doing
and if it were some other weird reason
you'd know it
but his by his uh interpretation is
exactly like mine but I'm going to put
my own words on it
my words are that the Soros family
they have some things they need to let's
say repair reputationally would you
agree would you agree that George Soros
should repair
his family's reputation before he dies
that's probably a good thing
because he's got the whole Bank of
England betting against the pound thing
I don't know the details of that he's
got the story about helping the Nazis in
World War II that's not a good look
so even though he was a kid so I
personally I give him a pass for that
the way he responded on 60 Minutes
sounded weird so people are like well
we're not even sure he was sorry about
that
so
I believe that the Soros family their
biggest priority
is
rehabilitating their reputation
by doing good work with charitable stuff
however
I apply the Dilbert filter to this
situation
the way I got rich with the Dilbert
comic is making fun of people who had
good intentions and bad implementations
here's an example
uh management is good
you can't really have a big entity
without some kind of management so
management is a good thing
but if you do too much of it you've got
micromanagement
or if you let your management happen by
Third parties like CEI and ESG well that
would be about an example of bad
management because there are too many
too many chefs in the kitchen sort of
thing
so everything I write about is a good
idea
that went wrong
that's what this looks like to me
now you could say pseudo-intellectualism
but the pseudo-intellectualism is is
sort of the good intention part the good
intention is and let me give you by the
way I'm going to give you another theory
after this that's even more fun
which might even be right but my my
current working Theory is that they're
trying to do the right things
and they're trying to for example not
have an excessive number of black
Americans in jail
for relatively low level crime
and probably they said to themselves hey
we can make America better
by having fewer black people in jail
it's closer to an equity situation and
the fastest way to do that is to not
jail them for non-violent crimes
now that doesn't mean it's going to work
but that would be
that would be a noble idea wouldn't it
same with climate change right if
they're if they're giving money to
climate change
um
it could be
that they think climate change is a real
problem and they're really trying to
help
it's just that
the things that happen because of that
maybe aren't as helpful
so
let's cut as a pleading heart
I I just wonder even what you're
listening to are you listening to some
alternative where my mouth is moving but
you're hearing different words come out
some of the comments are just so left
field all right so one possibility is
that the Sorrows have good intentions
they're trying to rehabilitate the
family name or at least do what's right
with the world and not be killed for
having too much money because one of the
reasons that rich people do charity is
so you don't kill them and take their
money
that's why they do it
they also might want to help the world
but it's really good to defend yourself
by showing that you're doing something
good for the world then people go oh
okay I hate that they have billions and
I don't have billions but at least
they're giving it away
right sort of the the Bill Gates Theory
so but I'm going to give you one more
theory that I've not heard from anybody
that goes like this
imagine that you thought and this is
just about the the D.A the district
attorney part not other parts imagine
you thought that the biggest problem in
the world is that too many uh not the
biggest ones but a big problem is that
too many black people are being locked
up and that we're using prison
instead of school
suppose that was your view because
that's my view that's pretty close to my
view is that we use the prison system to
basically take black people out of the
public
that's what it looks like to me it looks
like there are a whole bunch of white
people who couldn't live with that many
black people who were doing smaller
crimes and bigger crimes and so the
prison system grew up as a illegal way
to take black people out of the
population and put them in jail
now I don't know if I don't think
anybody had that thought like I don't
think anybody was in a meeting and said
hey let's do something to take black
people out of the public but it happened
I don't think it was intentional but it
happened
now suppose you were Soros
and you said to yourself
I have to change that
it's it's completely wrong
but the thing that needs to be changed
is too deep
in other words you'd have to change the
school system you'd have to change
maybe something about single parents
maybe something about where people live
you know maybe something about welfare
or something about trading but all those
are too big
like they're just too many big things
that would need to be fixed
so what would you do if you thought you
had to fix this situation
but you couldn't think of any way to fix
it because the fix is too big
what would you do
well one thing you might do
is break the system
because if you break it it's going to
have to do the big things to fix itself
if you don't break it it'll keep limping
along the way it is
so we had a limping system of taking
people that we had completely failed
Society had completely failed we gave
them no structure gave them no education
gave them no skills
and then surprise or a criminal
so Society completely fails a class of
people largely black people in poor
areas
and if you're George Soros and you say
that's unfair
got to fix it the only way you can fix
it is to make it worse
the only way you can fix it is to make
it worse it's a version of embrace and
amplify which I talk about all the time
if you want to break a bad idea embrace
it totally
because it's a bad idea if you Embrace a
bad idea totally it becomes really
obvious that everything will fall apart
if you just sort of well
you know I'll bow to that idea but I
won't follow it too rigorously then it
can limp along forever and you don't
want it limping along forever you want
to break it so you can fix it
now those of you who say this is mind
reading
no it's speculation mind reading would
be I think it's true
I didn't say that
I said it's one of the hypotheses
I don't think it's true I think my
hypothesis is the strongest one which is
they're trying to do good things they
give their money to organizations that
sound like they're good organizations
and then that organization does
something messed up
so here's the number one question I
would ask
if you looked at all of the things that
Soros gives his money to
is it all destructive
because if it's all destructive
that would argue for evil
wouldn't it that'd be a pretty strong
argument for just evil or or that he's
trying to break everything to make money
somehow
but suppose suppose you looked at his
entire portfolio
and he found that I don't know if this
is true by the way but I suppose you
found that 80 percent of it was just
feeding poor people
and you didn't know about it oh he's
also feeding poor people
but 20 of it is really sketchy stuff
like hiring DA's that don't want to
prosecute crime that's really sketchy
or getting Democrats elected that's a
little a little too much into the
political interference Realm
would it change your mind if you knew
that eighty percent of what he was doing
was purely good and everybody agreed
but that 20 looks sketchy
because if he's purely evil it's all
evil
unless unless it's just a way to hide
the evil but that seems weird
so it's either all evil
or only a little bit of it is evil and
if only a little bit of it is evil
twenty percent let's say just for
conversation if 20 of it looks clearly
evil I think the Dilbert the Dilbert
hypothesis is the strongest one
but I don't know that
right so without knowing that I can't
say for sure but if it turns out he's
doing good things and bad things don't
say the bad things are probably
accidental because they're doing a lot
of stuff
and they may also
think that uh temporarily having higher
crime
is okay
they may think yeah move out of the city
either move out of the city or pay more
taxes so that the you know the poor
people who have turned to Crime don't
have to turn to Crime but those are your
two choices
so I guess I'm going to leave this with
if Elon Musk doesn't know what's going
on but his best guess is that they're
trying to do something useful but
failing
I'm on board with that that's my best
working hypothesis is that there's
pseudo and intellectualism gave them
some bad ideas about what works and what
doesn't work
how many will buy onto my theory of is
just pseudo-intellectualism
and uh bad implementation
anybody
correct as borba says in all caps I will
allow the all caps in this case
uh so one of the comments was so like
all Democrats exactly yeah the Democrat
Party has won
um overarching theme which is they
prefer goals over systems they will
break your system
if they can make a temporary you know
goal of more equity
but the broken system if it happens to
be the free market is going to destroy
everything
whereas the Republicans are more likely
to say well let's keep our constitution
intact let's make sure that everything's
working and then we'll do the best we
can about these you know inequities
but you got to make sure the system
works where we're all dead that seems to
be a difference between Republicans and
Democrats Democrats want to go for the
answer even if it destroys the system
that supports everybody's life
is very consistent you see it everywhere
the difference might be in military
stuff because that's the
military-industrial complex is in charge
of that and not Democrats or Republicans
all right
so if I haven't angered you enough
I have more
so I looked into the myocarditis and
sudden death of athletes situation and I
asked on Twitter
hey you doctors hey doctors are you
seeing in your practice a lot more
myocarditis and sudden deaths what do
you think the answer was
good
um not practice but to family members
which is weird
but
um the the Mayo Clinic
which believe it or not has for years
for decades actually they've been
tracking uh sudden deaths of young
athletes
apparently that's something that's been
tracked for decades by the Mayo Clinic
and the Mayo Clinic who has been
tracking the rate and the the reasons
for sudden Cardiac Arrest an athlete
says
no difference at all
no difference
do you believe it
or or did something get to him do you
think somebody got to the Mayo Clinic is
not one person you know it's people in
this department
no I I think it's true I think the Mayo
Clinic is seeing no difference in
myocarditis
or or no difference in sudden deaths let
me correct that they were talking
specifically about sudden death
myocarditis separately is also not seen
by doctors
now can you find some people who claim
to be doctors in the comments
and also say they're seeing it yes
yes but the people who have MD in their
profile they don't see it the people who
don't have MD in their profile but tell
me they're doctors oh they see it oh
they can see it pretty well but the
people who are actual doctors no don't
see
um
all right now does that mean it's not
real
not really
not really
but
um and do we believe that there's more
myocarditis
I have a theory about why there's more
myocarditis
has anybody said this
I think there's more myocarditis because
we're looking for it
and maybe it was always there
because it seems like something that's
temporary and can be caused by a number
of factors
so my guess is that what everybody said
hey myocarditis is a problem that it was
the first thing that a doctor would look
for
whereas if you came in with exactly the
same symptoms five years ago and you
said hey I have I'm tired I having
trouble breathing whatever would the
doctor have even checked you for
myocarditis would they have even checked
I don't know I don't know the answer to
that by the way coping
I can tell the people who fell for the
4chan hoax they always say coping
I'm sorry you fell for that
but doesn't that seem like the the most
likely
um explanation is that we're looking for
it and we were never looking for it
before but his symptoms mimicked other
things so they probably got treated for
other things
what would happen if you came in for
myocarditis
it was misdiagnosed and they gave you
some treatment for some other thing and
then you did the treatment for the other
thing what's the most likely outcome
you got the wrong treatment for
biocarditis the most likely outcome what
is it
your myocarditis would go away on its
own
right
am I wrong about that you better correct
me if I'm wrong
but I would think there are four years
doctors have been treating myocarditis
thinking it was something else and then
when the problem went away because it
goes away on its own
they said oh I'm glad I treated that uh
whatever it was correctly because it
went away
so to me it very much looks like a
counting problem
can you have your money back people
don't like this now keep in mind for
those of you who are convinced Beyond
any doubt that the myocarditis is real
I'm not I'm not doubting it
can you accept that
in my mind that's still an open
possibility
there's very much a possibility that
both the both the covid
and the shots
created myocarditis I think that's very
possible
but I also think at the same time we're
probably diagnosing it when we wouldn't
have
so there might be a few different
effects that are happening at the same
time
watch the doctors that Dr Drew has on
lately in all caps well I'll ask him
you're confused what am I confused about
what am I confused about
now keep in mind I've allowed the I've
allowed the possibility
that the shots are causing lots of
myocarditis are you happy with that
I've not ruled it out
If I Ruled it out you could be mad at me
if you think it's true I'm just saying
that there are other hypotheses that are
at least equals
and you should not
forget about them
now
why would the you know the the Mayo
Clinic not be aware of people suddenly
dying at higher rates that would be very
unusual but possible
but possible
yeah so the the the thing that people
always tell me is that I should do my
own research
right so I just did my own research
you don't like it
I thought you wanted me to do my own
research on this question I did I did my
own research and this is my conclusion
my conclusion is that nobody knows
so all all possibilities are still on
the table
that
that's my conclusion
research Mayo Clinic funding do I need
to
now I I accept uncritically that
everybody in the medical world
has some kind of financial stake
I don't need to research that do I
but I also don't think that the head of
the guy who's in charge of sudden deaths
is going to say there's no sudden death
that's just not going to happen
that is just not going to happen in any
world that I'm a part of
that the person who noticed a massive
increase in sudden deaths and was the
person whose job it is to spot more
sudden deaths of young athletes you
think he's going to shut up
no way all right not in the world I live
in in my world that doesn't happen
but I suppose Anything is Possible
all right
all right uh CNN has two stories one
remote work is becoming less popular now
that's Story number one so the number of
remote workers has gone down from higher
percentage to a lower percentage and
looks like it's continuing that Trend so
there might be more hybrid work but also
more people in the office
so at the same time the CNN reports that
remote work is becoming less popular
a separate story is about how remote
work is so popular that office buildings
are empty and it might be a huge real
estate slash banking problem
foreign
you're a and you're
gonna go away here's what you can't say
to me without getting banned
dwa says Dr Drew Scott can't see the
truth you
for being useless
all right
I saw all of the truths
I see several possibilities that all fit
the facts if you only see one set of
possibilities that fit these facts
the problems are you're out
right you you need you need to tell me
what's wrong with my hypothesis you
don't need to tell me that yours fits
the facts
right tell me that your hypothesis fits
the facts is nothing
it's nothing it's not thinking it's not
being smart it's not doing your own
 research it's just being an
idiot you have to tell me what's wrong
with my hypothesis if you can't do that
 off
all right
um
so yeah so a bunch of Office Buildings
are going to be empty but I'm not sure
sure these Office Buildings are empty
empty or they have a different rotating
number of people who have to come to the
office sometimes but not all the time
I do wonder what's going to happen to
them all I think that
cities are dead
how many of you have heard people say
that you should move out of cities is
that something you've heard not from me
from other people
um
all right you've heard that right
now when people say move out of cities
do they get canceled
because you know what they're saying
right they are saying move away from
black people you know that right move
away from the cities just basically move
away from black people because that's
what they're doing
when you see the crime all of the videos
of crime are black people
it's like nearly 100 percent
so the people who say move away from the
cities are it's just coded language it's
just coded where they say oh it's crime
well the crime is coming from primarily
one place in cities
there are plenty of white people who are
criminals yeah blah blah blah
now I'd like to take it aside for the
dumb people you don't mind I'm just
going to take a minute for the dumb
people
this is for the dumb people I'm going to
talk in dump talk so you can understand
it better when somebody says anything
about black people they do not ever mean
all of them never never ever does it
mean all of them it never means that
ever ever ever
that was just for the dumb people
now
um
I think a move down the city is I'm
surprised that people are not getting
canceled for that
because
it's kind of coded language
just say it directly
so
let's talk about some more stuff I'll
get back to me in a minute
um
Rasmussen has a poll on the Trump
prosecution 64 percent of Voters agree
with the statement that it's Banana
Republic stuff
nearly two-thirds of American voters
think the prosecution of trump is a
Banana Republic move even if they think
he should be prosecuted
64 percent
my God
yeah it's gonna happen anyway probably
so how about that Tick Tock band that
turns out to be completely fake
we hear today that Biden is
is organizing a huge uh influencer event
at the White House and might even give
The Tick-Tock influencers specifically
Tick Tock specifically Tick Tock
influencers their own space at the White
House or something
so apparently the Democrats led by Biden
they are they're trying
they are trying
to use tick tock in a really major way
for the next election
do you think that Biden is serious about
trying to ban it do you think Congress
the Democrats are serious about trying
to ban it no now you can see the play
the play is obviously that they made a
poison pill legislation that the
Republicans would not be able to sign
that's it it was always a play it was
never about banning Tick Tock the the
legislation would ban Tech talk also but
it can't get assigned because it's such
an overreach it's just like Patriot Act
Two there's no possible way that can get
assigned
everybody sees it even even uh Fareed
zakario on CNN
CNN one of their major hosts Fareed is
tell you that it's a huge overreach
problem and it's not about tick tock
everybody can see it it's obvious that
they don't plan to to ban tick tock it's
obvious
it's just like when Newsome sent the
reparations people away to come up with
a number
he knew that that was the way to kill it
because they would come up with a dumb
ass number and they did so no nobody can
take it seriously now well that's what
happened
that's what the Democrats did with uh
tick tock they just decided to come up
with the only thing you couldn't vote
for it was the only way that you could
make that impossible to vote for it
think about how easy it would have been
to ban tick tock
Tick Tock is banned in the United States
one sentence
that's it no enforcement needed
because Apple would immediately take it
out of the Apple Store
Google would take it out of their store
that'd be that one sentence that would
be the whole law as soon as you see it's
this whole big thing about vpns and
managing everything in the world is
obviously fake
I believe everybody who put their name
on that should be uh should be impeached
everybody everybody who sponsored that
should be impeached Republicans and
Democrats alike
they should all be impeached because
it's so obviously
they're working against the interests of
the United States very publicly very
obviously they certainly know how to
make a bill to ban Tick Tock don't they
do you think they don't know how to
write a bill to ban Tick Tock they do
they know how to do it they're choosing
not to
it's not an accident
everybody who put their name on it
should be impeached
and including the Republicans including
Republicans
all right
um
so there's a story about a so-called
intelligence leak but it might be a hoax
so there's some classified Pentagon
documents that got out and some of it
seems to talk about Ukraine but some of
it seems to talk about the U.S spying on
its allies like South Korea Israel and
Ukraine
um
and apparently there's some history of
leaked documents being fake leaked
documents
wherever Russia is concerned I guess and
do you think it's real
it might be a real leak
that was modified after the fact
to make it look like it wasn't a real
leak
that's a possibility
but do you think any of our allies are
surprised that we might be trying to
surveil them
do you think any of our allies would be
like super surprised oh no
they're trying to find out what we're
thinking of course not
it's just so business as usual
so I don't know whether this is real or
fake it might be at least part fake
so I was asked to talk about and I was
going to anyway Tesla opening another
battery Factory in China
some uh what do they call it a mega pack
Factory now
how do we navigate the fact that
Tesla and everything musk is doing seems
enormously positive and good for the
United States if not the world
at the same time that it's a real
problem that Tesla is married to Chinese
Manufacturing
on the other hand
could could Tesla be as successful if
they did not use Chinese manufacturing I
think the answer is no
I don't think there was a practical
alternative
but building up you know spitting up new
factories in 2023 has a really bad look
to it
it's a bad look
my guess is that the factory was planned
several years ago
when things weren't as bad looking as
they looked down and it was just too
hard to stop at and too expensive and
maybe not even desirable
but
um
I don't understand why we're not hearing
at least stories about moving more
gigafactories to the United States or to
Central America
because I think Central America is just
sort of a natural place to put uh
you know an industry that's sort of a
factory industry
so and there might also be something
about the rare earth materials it could
be that if you're in China you have more
access to the rare earth materials maybe
just guessing but if you were operating
out of another country maybe China would
be less likely to sell them to you or
something I don't know but that might be
part of it I'm guessing that the it's
not easy
to not be in China if you need batteries
so I'm assuming that Tesla would have
already pulled out of China if you could
do it
if you could do it without you know
crashing the company I think it would be
done already
but on the other hand Tesla is an
international brand
and he kind of needs to sell cars into
the biggest market for cars in the world
which is China
so it's a real tough situation I I guess
the best thing I'd like to see is just
more battery Manufacturing in the United
States
one way or the other
and I think the United States needs to
make it easier for Tesla to do that so
there might be some kind of
thing however if you've been following
the news today
it turns out that
musk has one big problem with Twitter
which is that big corporations and this
was reported today on Fox and also there
was something called semaphore
which does some kind of reporting and
some before reported that somehow they
got a hold of some emails about some
marketing events that musk was going to
attend
and some of the big VPS of marketing at
the big companies
were talking about how they were
hesitant to advertise on Twitter because
of of musk's
racist stuff
what
what race is stuff
don't you wonder what that refers to
now they're not talking and keep in mind
they're not just talking about things
that people do on Twitter
they talk about that also
but specifically they're talking about
Elon Musk himself being a racist
do you know why
they gave one reason
guess
what the reason is that Twitter will go
broke because advertisers say that Elon
Musk himself is a racist guess why
how are you not getting this
you don't know the answer to this
question
I swear to God I'm not making this up
the answer is me
they name me
as the reason that Allah mosque is a
racist
just let that settle in for a little
minute
and what they say is that he quote
defended me
well first of all the story itself is
all wrong because I was speaking out
against racists
and apparently if you speak out against
racist you get labeled the racist
yourself
and apparently if you say that somebody
who got labeled a racist for speaking
out against racists
if you say that his Comics should not be
canceled which is all must said that you
must agree with the racist and therefore
you're a racist but you'd be agreeing
with somebody who was anti-racist none
of it matters
so somehow they've managed to conflate
my story into a whole different story
and then they've attached him to it for
the most trivial connection you could
ever imagine
and then they've decided that all of
Twitter must be racist because it's the
um the association thing
it's like okay he did this he's this you
know him you said this therefore
you're all attached to the original
comment
imagine me reading that this morning
it's actually on Fox Fox is reporting
about the semaphore report
Fox News is reporting that that
corporations think Elon Musk is a racist
because he once said that Dilbert
shouldn't be canceled
do you know who else said Dilbert
shouldn't be canceled
a lot of black people
a lot of them
not all of them of course but a lot of
black people even people who hated what
I said
even people who said oh you shouldn't
have said that that was offensive
of course it was offensive it was
supposed to be offensive
but even black people say I shouldn't be
canceled so Elon Musk saying what
Ordinary People Say
and by the way I ran a poll who were the
real racists the people who canceled me
or me 96 four percent said I was a
racist in the story 96 said either
everybody's a racist or the people who
canceled you are racist
I've been completely Vindicated
by public response
except for the woke entities that need
to respond to these three letter woke
pressure groups they're the only ones
who are have a problem with me everybody
else is fine
how many of you know that I'm more
popular than I've ever been
at the moment
you're aware of that right
my my Twitter audience is bigger than
it's ever been my locals is through the
roof
I've never been more popular and today
there was a uh
story on uh let's see
a story about me
on a podcast called The Glenn what is it
the Glenn show with Glenn Lowry and John
McWhorter now correct correct me if I'm
wrong they're both black
is anybody who is familiar with the show
I don't want to judge anybody just by
looks
but they're both black right
good I'm just saying visually that's my
best guess but I don't want to be wrong
about that okay well a lot of people say
yes anyway their conclusion was and I'll
read a key part of that
um
to conclude so they talked about my
situation a little bit and they said to
conclude Scott Adams crudely and rudely
gave voice to a phenomenon that I think
we all have to take seriously it's a lot
of decent people honorable people
confronted with a dilemma and having to
make their way in the world and the
Dilemma is this
living in cities
is too dangerous now and so they're
saying out loud exactly what I said
so there's two black
um apparently very smart I mean just
based on listening to him for a few
minutes very smart
prominent to black men who said yes
white people are going to have to deal
with the question of do they want to be
around black people
under these conditions
now did they get canceled they said what
I said
they agreed with me except they said
that I was
crude and rude but that's agreeing with
me as well
because I meant to be crude and rude and
I meant to offend
to get attention
for for a point not for just attention
but
did it work
so now that you can see that two
prominent black podcasters have have
taken my point
and they've they've added some
intellectual I would say weight to it by
saying this is a real problem that white
people have and it becomes a black
person's problem and the way it becomes
black people problem is if the white
people move away you lose your tax base
which he said directly one of the
probably Glenn so that was their point
directly if you scare people away
and you are
and you are that's what I said
if you scare people away by basically
teaching one group of people that white
people are the problem
I don't want to be around anybody who
thinks I'm the problem
I want to get away from that as far as I
can yeah
and they basically agreed
with the with the main point but not the
way I presented it
now they're not the only people who
agree with the point
so far everybody does
you know that right
literally everyone
agrees with what I said but not the
Vigor with which I said it you know the
offensive way I said it
now let me ask you this
if I had not said it the offensive way I
said it would it be a national topic
it would not
it would not
do you see what happened
this is what is supposed to happen
this was supposed to happen just like
this without me getting canceled so much
I didn't think I'd get canceled globally
but I didn't know it would be trouble
I created trouble
so that people would talk about this
seriously because in my mind it's one of
the maybe the biggest problem in the
country
and if you don't talk about it honestly
there's nothing you can do you can't
solve it by talking about it and lying
oh everything's fine all right
no everything's not fine
we've created a a narrative where it's
no longer safe for white people to spend
too much time around large populations
of black people not just because of
crime but because the the uh
the training that's happening right now
through
ESG and CRT and everything else is that
white people are the problem and
specifically straight white men
so I don't want to be around people who
have a problem with me and here's the
problem as I think
Glenn Lowry and John McWhorter would
probably agree
how do I know who's going to be nice to
me and who isn't
how do I know
I don't have a way to know that so the
only rational thing to do is stay away
from any risk
so you just minimize your risk by
staying away from them
nobody disagrees with that
literally no one disagrees with that
but I'm the bad one all right so I guess
my only point is that rudeness has
utility and I was using rudeness for its
utility and I would conclude that it
worked
because I introduced the topic and now
it's a real topic and now people can
talk about it a little more honestly
all right
um
we discovered with a Freedom of
Information Act I forget who asked for
it
but the FBI has been using certain words
to flag extremists on the internet here
are the words they use to flag
extremists now when they say extremists
they mean racists and insurrectionists
basically
so here are the words that I'm sure you
would recognize as being words that are
uniquely
identifiable with bad bad racist
terrible people
red pill
red pill
if you use red pill the FBI gets flagged
how about Chad
some people refer to Chad as you know
some based white person how about based
based is on there do you know how many
times people call me based
happens a lot
yeah does that mean I'm an extremist
because people call me based
maybe in some ways not the way they're
looking for them how about LARPing
l-a-r-p you know pretending to be
something apparently if you use the word
LARPing you're an extremist
or more likely to be one
um
yeah you would be a racially or
ethnically motivated violent extremists
if you use the phrase red pill
oh man
I don't even know what to say about that
I don't even know what to say about that
sometimes the stories are so bad that
you don't even have a comment and you're
like
really
really
I mean the argument for disbanding the
FBI it just gets better and better
all right
yeah what else is going on
um
I like to follow the Don Lemon drama
apparently there was a hit piece on him
in the variety
and CNN says that variety uh
um hit them with fake news
so imagine being CNN
and having to defend yourself
from another part of the left-wing media
that told a bunch of lies about you
do you know who else variety lies about
everybody
ah everybody so live by the fake news
die by the fake news but apparently some
of the things about that variety said
about Don Lemon CNN says we're not true
but we do know his ratings are bad and
he has a whole bunch of
uh let's say offensive things he said to
women in the past that they think he's a
misogynist
or some people do
and I wasn't mad about any of that until
I was reminded by the story that Don
Lemon once compared Trump supporters to
Ku Klux Klan members
and then I thought oh okay well him
yeah
I I was defending him for a while
you know I thought well he's just you
know playing his role there on CNN but
he looks like you'd be a fun guy
and I'm going to change my mind now
he uh he looks like a destructive
personality
so maybe if there is such a thing as
pure evil
maybe Don Lemon is never know
I don't think there's a thing called
Pure Evil but
if there is
he'd fit the facts
but the I guess the mystery is why he
has not been canceled by the network so
far he's causing them all kinds of
trouble and he doesn't give them good
ratings
now if you cause your network a lot of
trouble and you don't give them good
ratings
how do you not get fired
and the speculation is that he has that
he's so litigious that between the fact
that he's black and gay that he would
just sue the hell out of him and they
just don't want to deal with it
I don't know if that's true but that's
one hypothesis
all right
I guess there's some kind of problem
with Chinese companies partnering with
U.S companies to make things in the
United States
and
I don't know is that a problem
I guess it is if it allows some
intellectual property to make it back to
China
that's a problem I suppose
but
I feel as if China would be less likely
to want to destroy the United States if
a lot of Chinese people had business
here
I don't know sort of a double-edged
sword
it's something I'd watch for certainly
for the intellectual property part but
uh I'm a little as long as the as long
as the Enterprise is in the United
States
it's not the worst problem in the world
to have Chinese ownership is it if it's
not a majority
I don't know
I don't mind some investment
all right
um AOC wants to impeach some judges I
think she's thinking of
uh
what's his name Judge Thomas
but you you here's what she said quote
if we do not impeach when lifetime
appointees repeatedly break the law in
stunning shows of corruption if we do
not rate in the systematic abuse of the
judicial overreach if all we rely on is
yeah blah blah blah abusing power so she
wants to impeach judges
this is very consistent
with AOC and the Democrats
what does impeaching a judge sound like
a goal right sounds like a goal
like maybe she wants to impeach Clarence
Thomas or maybe she wants to impeach the
federal judge who just ruled against the
abortion pill
but she's decided that impeaching judges
would be a good idea
now
what are you yelling at Erica
um
I'll pay attention to YouTube for a
moment
oh I Disappeared now I'm backing us
so
this is once again AOC has a goal
instead of a system the goal is to get
rid of these judges that she thinks are
abusing their power
but if you were to do that it would
destroy the system of an independent
judiciary
now how is it that she continuously
doesn't see that she's got a goal that
would destroy the system
it's just over and over again and it's
always the same thing inability total
inability to see um
consequences
they don't see systems they don't see
motivation they don't see
uh incentives
all right lastly
there's some conversation about Ubi
Universal basic income paying people
even when they don't work
and the idea is that robots and AI will
take away so many jobs we might need AI
or I'm sorry we might need Ubi
to keep people alive
cernovich had a interesting quote about
this on Twitter he said I was open to
Ubi arguments then we have it during
covid it did nothing but increase
alcoholism and obesity
what do you think of that
do you think Ubi would do nothing but
um
exacerbate people's bad habits
I say yes I agree but I would add one
layer of complexity to it
I would liken Ubi to marijuana
one of the big complaints with marijuana
is that you'll do it and you'll become
lazy and you won't you won't get done
what you need to get done
my observation is this that marijuana
makes you more of what you already were
if you were lazy to begin with oh it'll
make you lazier no doubt about it
but if you were ambitious naturally it
will make you more ambitious
it just sort of exacerbates or
accentuates what you already were
now during the pandemic
the people getting the Ubi
many of them had low-end jobs where the
Ubi was better than the job
probably those were not necessarily the
the go-getters
and they may have said hey I can drink
more and I got nothing going on
but
if you said I'm going to give a
MacArthur genius award to somebody
but you don't have to do anything for us
it's just we're giving you money because
you're so smart we think you'll do smart
things with it but we're not going to
tell you what to do with it you can just
spend it if you want
and in fact a number of MacArthur
recipients the thing that made them a
MacArthur recipient is that they were
ambitious
in other words they they came to the
attention of the MacArthur people
because they'd done such good work and
probably worked hard all their life and
and now they said let's give you some
money to see what you can do with it
so those people I believe give free
money and work harder
because that's who they were now they've
got this extra resource so they can put
some extra work into
so I think that Ubi will be like weed
it'll make you more of what you already
were
lazy people will just be destroyed by it
because they need they need a reason to
get up and go to work
and ambitious people will say well I've
got a little freedom
a little more freedom to write that book
I wanted a little more freedom to do
that startup I wanted
learn that thing I wanted to learn go
back to school
so I think it's going to be both
all right ladies and gentlemen it's very
topic
that I didn't talk about
lots of good news on Monday released
interesting news
yeah Ubi is not the same as grants or
scholarships but it still demonstrates
the point
uh are you still a pro-trans community
of course
duh
let apparently I have to do another
notice for the dumb people just one
moment this will only take a moment
this is for the dumb people
oh there might be some bad people who
are also trans
anything you say about trans does not
apply to a hundred percent of them some
of them might be violent
some of them might not be
but anything you say about them does not
apply to all of them
I just thought you needed to hear that
again
so no the fact that Riley Gaines got
attacked by a bad
trans person
doesn't mean anything about the trans
Community it tells you nothing
it's just like every other group has
some bad people in it what's that tell
you about it nothing
doesn't tell you anything about it you
got to treat them as individuals if you
don't treat people as individuals
well what are you doing
now by the way if this seems
inconsistent
I say you should treat every person as
an individual
at the same time I say maybe you should
stay away from large communities of
people who have it out for you
those are consistent
because even in that large community if
I'm at an individual I would treat them
individually
one is a statement of risk that's not
dependent on any one person
and one is a statement about how do you
how do you treat one person
oh I I saw somewhere that I was
described as
there was some hit piece about me
recently I was described as a member of
the intellectual dark web
does that sound true
and I I've never been in the
intellectual dark web
that's not true
see the trouble is people have a hard
time identifying me because I'm left to
Bernie but I have a conservative
audience
for the most part not every person not
every person in the audience is
conservative when I say I have a
conservative audience I do not mean 100
of them are conservatives again notice
just for the dumb people
yes we're private
all right is there anything else
yeah I never liked that intellectual
dark web
because that would call me an
intellectual
and that's never been the case
um
but better at math
you quit alcohol thanks to me
well good for you let's have a
congratulations for this I think a
gentleman
who is quit alcohol for 12 weeks I don't
know if you had a problem or you're just
trying to have less of it in your life
but congratulations
right and I really mean that
I really mean that because if if you've
had a lifelong drinking habit whether
you're addicted or you just like it it's
not easy to stop
but wow is it important
so important
you know if I don't do anything else in
my life
except apparently I've influenced a
fairly large number of people to stop
drinking certainly nothing I saw coming
I did not expect my life would take that
path but if that's the only thing I did
I'm good
like I'm good with that because that's
the only thing I accomplished in my life
that's solid
sober for five months congratulations
I will even allow capital letters in
fact this should be an exception if
you're telling me that you've been off
drugs or alcohol
use all caps
that is not yelling because you should
be shouting that you should be shouting
that from the rooftops and I want you to
shout that be proud of it
15 months over here good for you
good for you
all right well I'm very impressed with
many of you in the audience very
impressed now I'm not you know I'm not
your uh
your doctor
and I'm not going to tell you that you
should never drink
but it certainly works for those who
stopped
all right
um
price to pay for our sins four years and
no drinking 10 years
and here we have somebody who's not
having drinks for three minutes well
that's a start
good for you I'm looking at all the
number of years going by
good for you I wonder if I have the
least drinking
uh followers of anybody
I convince you to quit alcohol too oh my
God so many of you
now I realize I'm not I'm not hearing
from the people who are continuing to
drink but there are a lot of people on
the locals platform especially telling
me they quit
all right
caffeine I'm I think I still like
caffeine
using assistant to monitor your blood
pressure that's a good idea too
all right that's all for now
um YouTube I'm gonna say bye for now

technology all worked today
and
you're all great
