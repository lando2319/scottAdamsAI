good morning everybody
and aren't you delightful
well i don't think i've ever enjoyed
being with you more
and i mean you
so
have you all prepared for today's
incredible incredible livestream
possibly the highlight of civilization
and certainly of your life
well if you did prepare you probably
have something like a copper mug or a
glass attacker jealous to stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing that makes your oxytocin
quiver it's called
it's called
it's called
the simultaneous sip and that's why
you're here go
ahead
sure they come for the sip
but they stay for the love and the
enlightenment
where shall we start
with the love do you want the love or
the enlightenment first
i love all of you you're awesome
you couldn't be better
have you ever thought to yourself
how how
well you do some things compared to
other people not everything
but there are some of those things you
do
you know you know those things you do
other people aren't as good as you at
those things
just remember that
well let's see what's happening in the
world russia is cutting off their gas
from poland and bulgaria
over uh
those countries refusal to pay in
uh in uh what the hell is their money
uh
in they're russian russian
what the hell is it rubles or rupees who
has rupees
there's rubles right
which country has rupees
i think those two india's rupees all
right don't get your rubles and your
rupees confused
if you get your uh if you get your
rupees tangled up with your rubles
well where are you going to be then
so
my advice to you is
just keep your rubles out of your rupees
and
i wonder how far this is going to go
because
i don't think people necessarily
predicted that russia would actually cut
off
two countries from gas
and i'm not sure
how big a deal is that in the summer
i mean if it were a winter thing it
would be devastating right
but what do they do if they lose it in
the summer they just put on more
blankets or something
at night i don't know
so
uh are they cook with coal
i'm not i have no idea what poland and
bulgaria do
because their gas got cut off
does anybody know like what would that
actually do
are people going to do less of or more
of something yeah cold showers
i don't know
so i don't know how big a deal that is
now
the experts are also saying
well
russia isn't going to cut off the gas to
germany
because they've got nowhere else to sell
it that's that big
carpe
carpe donctum just weighed in on
youtube there
and
i guess we'll be seeing you back on uh
on twitter pretty soon
good to see you
well more memes coming i guess
so
let me make a prediction on this russia
cutting off gas stuff
they'll probably have to see how it goes
with poland and bulgaria but
apparently if they cut off gas to
germany
it's not as if they could just sell it
to china
because those pipelines were already
full and it would take a long time to
build new ones
so
does russia destroy its own economy
by also destroying
germany and
parts of europe
i don't know
we've got quite the brinksmanship thing
going on here but here's
a data point that i've been waiting to
hear
so i've
made a prediction
that
well
maybe it's just an observation
that you could predict
what's going to happen in ukraine and
russia by knowing the number of
shoulder mounted
weapons and
good munitions and drones they have
so the good stuff that i call it the
things that would really really make a
difference would be the stinger missiles
and the javelins and the the drones
and we're hearing now that
the united states doesn't even make
stingers and javelins
anymore
did you know that
there's no assembly line
there
here i imagined oh they're cranking up
the assembly line
they're going to work twice as fast
nope
they haven't made them for years
there is no assembly line
once we ship them they're done
it will take years
to even like gear up to make another one
why are we finding this out now
how long have i been telling you this is
the single most important thing you'd
need to know
to predict the course of the war and
we're just finding out now that well you
know we don't even actually make these
and if we tried to quickly make them
according to raytheon talking about the
stingers i guess in particular
they wouldn't be able to get the parts
so they could they couldn't make them
even if they had a factory
they wouldn't be able to get the
components to assemble in the factory
without other factories making the other
components so we're not even close
to being able to have enough stingers
and javelins to probably make a
difference
so unless unless there's something
different with drones
because in theory in theory you could
get done with drones
most of what you could do with a stinger
is that true
or are the drones not powerful enough to
take out a tank
i know
feels like some of them might be the i
mean not the the small drones might not
be but the big ones would be
so
um this is the thing to watch the number
of uh portable
super good weapons that the ukrainians
have access to and it looks like they're
not going to have access to enough
so my my current
prediction would be that russia would
win
based on the variables
today
right so any prediction that i make
about ukraine and russia from this point
on
are going to be the dumb kind
where you say well suppose nothing
changed
[Laughter]
then where would things go like no new
variables
but they're always new variables
always like this is a pretty new
variable at least in terms of my
understanding of it is new
so
um
i don't know i don't see ukraine having
enough weapons to be able to withstand
it the wild card here is
who's going to run out of ammo first
because now we know that the ukrainians
wink wink
have totally had nothing to do with
destroying the weapons depots that are
actually in russian territory i guess
there are three of them
that are suspiciously on fire
so
it looks like a war of weapons
you know what is interesting
this entire war could have been fought
without killing any people
all all both sides had to do is attack
their weapons depots
and see who could do it better
because whoever is better at attacking
and destroying the weapons on the other
side
i feel like that's who's going to win
so why not do that first
just everybody say look before any
soldiers shoot shooting each other
what's the point how about we're gonna
just attack your weapons depot wherever
we can find them
we'll give you we'll give you three
months
for three months all we'll do is attack
each other's weapons depots
you don't even have to put a guard there
we're not going to go in there in person
right too dangerous we're just going to
lob missiles and stuff at you maybe some
drones
helicopter now and then but we're just
going to attack the weapons depots
and once one of you is out of weapons
the war is over
and then you don't have to get any
people involved
am i right now i'm getting an even
better suggestion on locals so i'll have
to tell you on on youtube
um the only
really the only idea that i've seen is
better than my own
is a dance-off
so i think the entire thing could have
been settled with a dance-off
far less damage and as good an idea as
mine by
certainly
well let's talk about the trial of
johnny depp and amber turd
so
i guess the johnny depp team got a
psychiatrist on the stand
to analyze as best she could the
situation with amber turd
some of you might remember amber turd
was
she used to be amber heard
but now she's amber turd
and eberturd
was diagnosed by this psychiatrist who
did not diagnose her in person
so let's put that caveat on it
i don't know how valid it is for
somebody to diagnose somebody
without ever talking to them in person i
would imagine the psychiatrist say well
you should talk to them in person but on
the other hand do you know what's the
problem with uh talking to an amber
heard in person
suppose amber heard
or amber turd came to you as a patient
and the psychiatrist says how can i help
you
and they amber turd would she say well i
have this terrible personality disorder
and it's becoming a huge problem for
other people
can you help me solve my problem
that is really
doesn't seem to bother me too much but
it does seem to be a problem for other
people can you handle that for me the
psychiatrist would say well what
what are you doing she said well
i lie like crazy
i get all
i throw things i hurt people
and i do all these things is that the
way it goes
so it's pretty valuable right for the
psychiatrist
to talk to this patient in person
because then the psychiatrist will get
all this useful and valuable information
from the person
no
do you know what is the worst way to
diagnose amber turd
talk to her in person because the nature
of her problem obviously is gigantic
liar
right
with apparently no
no moral or ethical core whatsoever how
in the world is she going to tell her
psychiatrist anything except
how to get drugs
that's it
the only thing an amber turd would tell
a psychiatrist is whatever she had to
say in order to get whatever drugs she
thought she wanted
that's it
so
i would say
that if you're going to
i don't know if you would but if you
were inclined to
criticize the psychiatrist who was the
expert testimony
because she did not talk in person to
amber turd i would say that what she did
see probably was a lot better than that
because she heard the audio tapes that
were unscripted
you know she didn't know she was being
recorded
and she saw the evidence from the trial
and you know and the testimonies
and i would say probably that would be a
better source than talking to the person
in person
with this specific problem
for most any other problem you would
imagine that the person who goes to the
psychiatrist
actually wants it to be fixed
you know like i'm afraid of something or
i keep having weird hallucinations so in
that case they're probably going to be
honest with their psychiatrist
because they want to get fixed but this
would be a description of a personality
disorder that doesn't want to get fixed
so here's what the
expert said is the problem
with amber turd uh histrionic
personality disorder
likely now none of this could be any 100
kind of stuff
so
don't think anything is 100
um
and uh i guess the expert was named
curry
and she believes hurt has histrionic
personality disorder
and its key features are drama and
shallowness
and people with the disorder may be
uncomfortable with not being the center
of attention and when they feel like
they're not the center of attention they
will make up stories
take on victim or princess role
or seek caretaking
the expert said
now uh you heard me
give my expert diagnosis
um before we heard this in which i said
amber turd is clearly a vulnerable
narcissist
but the expert is saying histrionic
personality disorder
and i heard somebody else say borderline
personality disorder
and so i ask you
was my analysis incorrect
because i said vulnerable narcissist
fits everything on the checklist
and the expert said histrionic
personality disorder presumably because
it
fits the checklist
so who's right
let's take a vote
is scott right with his diagnosis a
vulnerable narcissist for amber turd or
is the expert
who does this for a living and is not a
cartoonist uh are they right with
histrionic personality disorder go
who is right
the correct answer is
it's the same thing
now
it's not the same thing
if you ask anybody who knows what
they're talking about
if you ask that an expert
i'm pretty we're pretty sure they would
say these are different things
if you ask them to tell you why they're
different
they will mention all the symptoms of
each
and they'll be the same
basically it's just two sets of words
that experts use
for a
set of conditions that are so
overlapping
that they can't really tell
and you would treat them the same
basically
which is run away
it's the same treatment
the the customer themselves you know the
client
basically can't be helped if they come
in with histrionic personalities
disorder they're just a monster
and there's nothing you could do about
it if they come in with vulnerable
narcissist
if that's the diagnosis
they're just the same kind of monster
but with different labels they do the
same things
so does it matter
if it's the same checklist of behaviors
with the same impact on other people
they also don't give a themselves
because they're happy it's not their
problem
it's other people's problem and
the what you do about it is exactly the
same run away
and certainly you can't treat them just
run away
like even the doctor would run away
like even the doctor doesn't want to
have anything to do with that because
the doctor is going to be a victim
right these are people who turn
everybody into a victim everybody it's
they can't turn it off they're just
destroying everything they touch
so
so i'm going to say that i'm going to
take perfect credit for my diagnosis
which
for all practical purposes is the same
as as the experts
what the expert did say is that ember
turd did not have in her opinion ptsd
and that that was likely
maybe i'm over interpreting this but
more like a cover story if you know what
i mean
so ptsd is something that somebody with
either histrionic personality disorder
or vulnerable narcissist would claim
as the reason for their behavior
and it would not be uncommon for
somebody to have such horrible monster
behavior
to claim that there is a very logical
reason for it and they can't be helped
there's nothing i can do about it
and it's certainly not because they're
just that way it's because of something
that happened to him and so it's
somebody else's fault because it's
always somebody else's fault
it's the fault of other people
all right so i think that johnny depp
should get some kind of a nobel prize
for
bringing to the attention of the world
the existence of these monsters
let's talk about elon musk
question do you believe that elon musk
would have purchased twitter
if not for the hunter biden laptop story
being so obviously
um
you know hidden by the press
and affecting
an election probably
now the the other hypothesis is that it
was the babylon bee getting banned
and
we know that he cared about that
so i would say
yeah we can we can say for sure that he
knew about it the babylon b
he knew about it and he had some kind of
relationship with them because he was
interviewed with him he seemed to like
him
so which do you think was the more
important one do you think he would have
spent 44 billion
because the a satirical
group got banned
i don't think so
i mean he might have cared i imagine he
did like
you know some
on some personal level
and also
from a free speech level he probably did
care about the babylon b
but i don't know that you would spend 44
billion dollars to fix that
would you
you know
but the hunter by the laptop story
that's a 44 billion dollar problem
like if you had 44 billion dollars and
you said are you are you serious
the hunter biden laptop story was
disappeared by the media one of the most
important things that could have ever
been reported on at the time it needed
to be reported on it was just
disappeared
what's the size of that problem
the size of that problem is easily 44
billion dollars in fact that would be a
bargain if you could fix that problem
for 44 billion dollars
it would be a bargain
given given the benefit it would be to
the country
and free speech and you know the the
basic
you know the vital maintenance of all
the things that matter to make you know
our system work yeah that's worth 44
billion
so it
we can't get his mind and never will
you know if you like i always say if you
could think like elon musk well then
you'd probably be like elon musk
but we're not
so we don't know what he's thinking
but i will say and first of all he
didn't spend 44 billion
i
i hear people talk like that and i say
it as kind of a shorthand but you know
he didn't spend anything right
he
he basically got a loan
i believe
that allows him to buy something that
has the same value ish
of the money he spent all he did was
take one kind of asset and turn it into
another kind of asset
that's not buying something
because when you buy something you think
in terms of consuming it so it's not
that kind of buying
all he's doing is transferring one asset
into another kind of asset in this case
the asset might have been
you know his uh
his bank ability
you know the ability that he has he
could pay he could repay a loan so
that's his asset
all right
um
true
so apparently truth social
is topping the apple app uh download
list
uh at the same time that
musk is buying twitter and here's what
makes elon musk different than other
people well
lots of things
but he tweets
after he buys twitter
he tweets that so true social is beating
twitter and tick tock
as the most downloaded
now is there anybody else who gives who
gives marketing attention to their
competitor
and
you know he used remember he got in
trouble for saying negative things about
tesla's stock price at one point he said
his own stock price was too high and it
like suddenly dropped i believe
now
isn't this why people like him
because he just
he just says something is true just
because it's true
if you're going to find out anyway
there's no reason he should hide it from
you and it's interesting
so if it's interesting
and it goes to the freedom of speech now
remember
musk is telling you that the reason he's
buying twitter
has to do with freedom of speech right
you would think that somebody who likes
freedom of speech would like the fact
that there are alternative platforms
so it's an interesting way to go that
you have to kind of respect because
presumably he can only protect his 44
billion
by doing a better job
or at least as good a job
as his competition
so it's sort of just you know game on
full transparency
let's compete let's fix our
fix our stuff let me tell you what would
help me the most
for a feature on twitter i would like a
feature in which i could turn off
comments
or block comments
from any accounts
that have fewer than i'll just say
10 followers
now those are almost all the trolls
now i hate to tell you now and and if if
only the blue checks could do it
that's all you would need so if you had
a blue check
could you turn off anybody who's got
fewer than 10 followers
because the reason is
if they're real
it shouldn't take them that long to get
10 followers and then participate if
they're not real they just got created
that day
and the bot identifier that you know
seeks out and destroys bots one assumes
that exists right
wouldn't twitter have a a bot hunting
bot
you know twitter's own bots would be
hunting the other bots i think by
behavior
so
if you could get rid of the
worst
bots on the blue check accounts which
have the biggest
visibility oh that would be huge
you know
and it wouldn't really hurt other people
too much because 10 followers you could
get that
and i think you could even identify the
bots that were artificially trying to
get 10 followers by following each other
because that would show up to the hunter
as well i think
um
so i signed up for truth social if you
want to find me there
i'm at at scott adams truth
so it looks like you don't get to pick
your
username you get to pick the first part
and then it looks like the system adds
the word truth to the end
so i didn't have an option of scott
adams says somebody i think somebody got
that one
i think somebody got that one before i
got there so there's probably a fake me
over there
unless i signed up twice which is
possible i may have signed up twice
could be
so i don't know how much uh tweeting
i'll do up there but i'll say again that
i don't understand why someone hasn't
made a product
that can just post all the sites
can somebody tell me is there a
technical reason that can't be done
because i've described exactly what it
should look like
what it should look like is you just
start typing whatever it is you want to
post
or you're putting in pictures or
whatever and then all of your various
social media accounts are are lit up
but let's say you go over the um
the uh
the character account for twitter
as you're typing the twitter the twitter
indicator should go off
to show that you would not be able to
post that so then you say okay okay
but if i take out a couple words it'll
work for all my accounts
or if i
make a shorter video
it'll work for all of my accounts but
maybe i don't care so this this one i'll
just put in the ones that are
highlighted i should be completely
oblivious
to where where the account is
shouldn't i
shouldn't i be able to post once and
have it go to all the accounts
now i don't know if you could do that in
terms of reading
and replying that might be a step too
hard but in terms of posting
there used to be that service but i
don't hear much about it where you could
do that
it never really quite worked to do it
so i'm expecting somebody to tell me
there's an account
that does that
but i don't see it so if you know of
that let me know it could be illegal
maybe there's just no way to do it
but i thought they all had
how can it be illegal if you have your
own
could you automate your own sign-ons and
postings
i don't know how that would be illegal
if it's just your own account
with a yeah an ifft
an ifftt right some version of that
right so
forget about the technical parts but it
seems like it's doable
i saw desantis get targeted by cnn i was
wondering when that would happen
and it looks like suppressive fire
because the way cnn talks about desantis
is in a
uh-oh kind of way
you know what i mean
so when the left looks at desantis they
just kind of say
uh oh
he looks
pretty solid
but i i was so
interested in what they would have to
say negative about him
and so they talked about how good he was
at sort of responding to what his base
would find as you know red meat and very
satisfying and many of us have said the
same thing i've been saying it for a
while that desantis is the most
capable politician
who is working at the moment
now trump's an outlier special case it's
hard to compare him to anything
but of the of the people who are you
know not trump
he's
i would say far and away
better than the next best person at the
moment and he's he's got this track
record he's setting up of doing these
really
spot-on
responses to things that are in the
headlines and just
just right for his base
and yet not so far
that they become easy targets for the
other side
so he's hitting that sweet spot he just
hits that sweet spot over and over again
it's not an accident you know at this
point it's obvious that it's it's
strategy it's technique it's skill
you know it's having good advisors it's
whatever it is it's it's the real thing
um so cnn takes a whack at them and
the best they can come up it with
is generic concerns
listen to this
um
so in the end in this piece by wolf i
think whoever it was their opinion
person
or one of them
he says
they're talking about uh it's talking
about how much skill he has desantis but
then the closer closer is this but it's
easy to imagine very different uses for
the massive federal apparatus
if someone with such talent meaning
desantis for the politics of division
were to assume the office wait a minute
wait a minute i thought we were talking
about just his talent
how did his talent
turn into a talent for
politics
okay that's good so far a talent for
politics
of division
of division
where did that come from so you get this
whole opinion piece where you sort of
agree with it you're like yeah yeah he
is he is really feeding his base yes he
is talented well he is talented more
than more people you're just shaking
your head yes yes
yes and then they do this they just slip
in
talent for the politics of division and
i'm thinking
well that division part wasn't part of
the story so much
like that was just slipped in like
like it had been proven or something or
like it's such a fact
that you would just
you just accept it it's just obvious
but there's no evidence for it
there's just evidence that he's good at
what he does
which is
satisfying your base basically
and so
so they actually believe he's too
talented to be president because that
would cause cause more divisiveness do
you know what causes more divisiveness
uh apparently the biden administration
because according to polls the
divisiveness is at an all-time
high under joe biden
now i don't think that's necessarily
biden's fault
as i also don't believe it's necessarily
was trump's fault that there was more
divisiveness under trump than there was
before i don't necessarily think it was
obama's fault that he was the most
divisive president since the one before
who is more divisive than the one before
it seems pretty clear to me that
that the media
is just making it more divisive no
matter who is the president
it's not really the person in office is
it
because it's clearly the media and
social media is making everybody look
more divisive
i mean while the walls are closing in on
trump listen to the way this story is uh
couched
uh this is i think cnn also lawyers for
the new york for new york state attorney
general's office now listen to the the
language that the lawyers
for the new york state's attorneys
general's office use right now keep in
mind that nobody has been proven guilty
by anything in this story
this is just an investigation but look
at their language
they said they are nearly finished with
their civil investigation into the trump
organization
after taking steps to unravel the real
estate company's assets that they
described as being as complex as a quote
russian nesting doll
what
what now you'd have to know that the
investigation
is looking into whether the trump
organization had some kind of
illegal relationship with russia or a
russian bank i guess
and then the the people who are these
supposedly uh
they should be objective
even when doing their job because
they're government employees
they refer to the complexity of it as a
russian nesting doll
which really is like saying he's guilty
without showing you any evidence
isn't it
is that
that feels completely like fireable
offense
i would say that if a lawyer
said this in public about somebody
they're looking into and called it a
russian nesting doll given that that's
the very nature of what they're looking
into
without showing you evidence and without
the benefit of a court telling you that
somebody is guilty of something this is
wildly
wildly inappropriate now i don't think
it's illegal
you know i don't know if you could sue
him for libel or something
might be premature for that
but i think you should be fired
you should be fired for that in fact you
should be fired even if the boss loves
you and even if you agree with the
comment you should still be fired for
that that is so fireable
oh my god it's fireable
am i wrong
does anybody disagree with that
it's perfectly legal and they have a you
know right to their opinion i guess
but from that office
you want somebody who at least pretends
to be objective this is not pretending
to to follow the law
they should at least put forward the
impression
that the law is what's going to
you know guide them not not their
opinion
anyway the walls are closing in
and the population of san francisco
plummeted a hundred thousand people
uh between 2020 and 2021
and
i have to ask this
is there any major city that didn't
lose
occupants
maybe ones that didn't close down
but i don't know how cities survive at
all
because it seems to me the cities are
for the benefit of the rich people
because then all the people who support
them and
everything is close and they could take
a helicopter they don't have to worry
about the traffic or the crime right but
it seems like the cities
are designed to benefit the top one
percent
and everybody else is going to suffer in
this horrible living conditions
because they need to be near the money
and the top one percent is where all the
money is
so
i feel like cities are just
a horrible system for humans
and that the natural
if i had to predict i think cities will
become depopulated
as a as a long-term trend
because the life the quality of life
will be so low it's where all the crime
is going to go it's where all the
protests are going to go it's where the
terrorists are going to attack
you know if nothing else
the
development of drones that anybody can
use for a terrorist attack
should make cities completely unlivable
because if you can do something people
are going to do it
somebody's going to fly you know drones
into the city and start doing something
horrible that i don't want to specify
and then people could say you know
the safest i could be
is to live in a non-dense area because
it doesn't make sense for a terrorist to
attack a non-dense area
so i think people are just going to be
driven to non-dense living styles
because
one individual can take out a city now
it used to be one individual could take
out a room full of people
like a mass shooting but now it'll be
very very soon and maybe we're already
there
one individual with the
you know some drones and some bad
intentions
could take out a city
so
you know it seems like depopulating
cities is just going to have to happen
and on that good news
so i retweeted today that study that
people didn't like about ivermectin
saying it was the biggest study and said
it didn't work
but then people said wait you studied it
wrong you didn't study it was zinc or
you waited too long or you did it wrong
or
whatever well the things we always say
when we don't like what a study says
but here is my only i don't want to
reopen the question of whether it's
works or not
i'm beyond caring about that at this
point
but
i would just point out though that the
new york times was the source of what i
tweeted
and on one hand you've got the new york
times saying that there's a
gold standard randomized controlled
trial that says ivermectin does not work
period
so that's the new york times the paper
of record
and a gold standard trial
on the other hand
arguing that it does work
i've seen people on twitter say that
they took it
and
they recovered from something that has a
99 recovery rate
and so because they took ivermectin and
recovered from something with a 99
recovery rate
they're quite convinced it was the
ivormectin that made the difference
and so you have that evidence on the
other side
now normally
in a let's say five years ago world
i would have said um
those are not the same
one of them is the paper of record the
most reliable newspaper
with the most reliable kind of study
gold standard randomized controlled
trial
i mean that's really solid
but
guy who thinks that recovering from
something that 99 percent of people
recover from no matter what they do
he thinks he knows it because he took
the ivormectin
that this seems a little sketchy right
well not anymore i judge those to be
equally credible
actually really
actually i'm not joking
there's no difference in the credibility
of those two things they both have zero
credibility don't they
which one has any credibility
i'd say neither
wouldn't you
would you give any credibility to a new
york times report about a randomized
control trial
sorry
it's 2022
and that dog is dead
that dog is dead i'd love to say
i would love to live in a world where
the news was believable and the
randomized controlled trials were not
maybe tainted by
who knows what
but we don't live in that world we just
know what people tell us that's it
that's all you know
all you know is what somebody told you
so i got two completely non-credible
sources
so what do you do
well i will tell you that if somebody
said well i don't think the ivormectin's
going to hurt me
and i don't have any credible
information that is going to help me
but
maybe
and then they go ahead and take it
i would not be the one saying that they
took
horse tranquilizer or whatever it was
why did we shut down our economy for
this
well probably because all the dead
people
i'm gonna i'm gonna say that
scott and cnn same thing good point
so
let me uh let me put the standard on
myself as someone on the locals network
just
challenged me
who would be more credible cnn or me
go
who's more credible cnn or me
now on the locals platform they actually
pay they pay a subscription fee so i
think that would be the
uh the most biased group but thank you
for saying me
scott plus
yeah
did you hear about the scott plus
streaming service
didn't do as well as we'd hoped
well here's the difference
the difference is cnn
tries to give you the facts
and i don't do that job
so we're not really in the same job
we're in the interpretation i'm
interpreting facts
and predicting and they're telling you
facts
with their original reporting in many
cases so not exactly comparable
but
nothing is credible that is true nothing
is credible so
here's what i hope that i could offer
you
number one
um
i generally tell you or i try to
where my biases are
and i so i tell you what i've invested
in i've told you i invested in tesla
twitter
apple
and and when others come up i tell you
and i tell you that i did not invest in
in disney for example
um
so
so
you at least know where my bias is
and i'm not yeah i'm not being paid by
any big pharma but i could be lying
right so you always have that problem
and
so i guess i would say that um
the thing i'm trying to do is help you
look at things through a different frame
you lost your shorts yesterday what's
that mean
the short sellers
yeah so what i'm trying to do is give
you a different way of analyzing the
same stuff but i don't know if the stuff
is real
that's the problem
so i can help you with the how to think
about stuff in a different way
usually it's the different way part that
i think i can add not so much better way
but sometimes just seeing things in a
different way add something
how to recognize reconcile the 99
survive and all the dead people
math
math
one percent times
lots of people
all right um
some constant says i don't think you lie
but you are misinformed sometimes as
opposed to who
so constant says i am misinformed
sometimes
to which i say of course
of course
but compared to
is there somebody who's well informed
i mean better than i am i don't know
i think we're all misinformed isn't that
the whole problem
if if anybody were well informed
or they labeled themselves well informed
i would say anybody who labels
themselves
well-informed don't listen to them
that would be somebody you shouldn't
trust at all because that's somebody who
doesn't even know what they don't know
at least i know what i don't know
if you don't know what you don't know
you call yourself well informed
you are not even trying to get informed
well that's true too
and so holling says that on some topics
i was not even trying to get informed
that is absolutely correct
do you know why
do you know why on some topics i was i
was
intentionally
not trying to do my own deep research
because that's ridiculous
it's ridiculous
so i do
avoid doing things that are ridiculous
for example
looking into climate change and doing my
own
evaluation of their of their science
what good would that
do wouldn't do any good because i would
have no reason to think that my deep
dive into the subject
got me the right information
so the people who are proud of their
ability to do their own research
are almost always the most
wrong
now i will make an inception for the top
i don't know
five percent of smart people
maybe the top five percent can do their
own research
and maybe get a better
take than they could if they hadn't but
95
will do their own research and just
believe in an extra bunch of lies or
alternative lies and they won't know it
so if you don't have some special
ability to sort through doing
your own research
just gives you more
now i don't think i have that ability i
don't believe i have the ability to
research something
and i could tell for example which
studies were good
i don't have that ability
i could talk to people who
seem to have that ability and listen to
them but you end up always with the same
result
there's always somebody who thinks every
study is bad
always
and it's always somebody who knows more
than i do
so what do i do with that if there's
always somebody who thinks the study is
faulty
and so
um
but when i when i referred to ivermectin
as horse meds i was doing it
sarcastically
i guess that's one of my problems
sometimes people can't tell what i'm
kidding
all right
ladies and gentlemen i believe that
we've run out of news and commentary
um
i'm going to tell you one thing about my
growth of twitter users
which is uh it's way up right it's up
gigantically even more than it was up
yesterday and yesterday it was up 10
times
so i think today it's up 20 times
baseline or something like that just for
a number of new users
so i took a look at my users
they all they it appears to be old bots
i don't i don't think it's people coming
back on the platform that's a little bit
of it i don't think it's the algorithm
changed
unfortunately
nope
it clearly is bots
so i don't know if anybody else is
having the same experience but you just
just do a quick look at your new users
they're all zero followers they're
they're obvious bots
so it looks to me like somebody or
buddies who control bots
have decided this is a good time to go
nuts with them
and it could be they're trying to create
a narrative
it could be they're trying to create a
narrative that
um
well the one that you believe which is
that the algorithm already got
changed by by people trying to hide
stuff
you know i don't think that's gonna
happen
i don't believe
that there's anybody with access to the
algorithm
who could change it at this point in
some substantial way where you're trying
to hide something where that wouldn't be
you know
let's say easily
found
because they got backups on backups
you don't think it would be obvious if
somebody tried to erase the algorithms
or or even tried to tweak it to get rid
of any hidden stuff
i don't know
because at the very least you would see
a behavior shift that couldn't be
explained by normal activity
so at the very least
the behavior of it would show up
now i don't think you're seeing that yet
this looks like a
false flag attack
you know what i mean
it looks like somebody who's trying to
make it seem as though the algorithm is
already changing
or
there's somebody who's a competitor
who just wants a bunch of bots on on
twitter to see if elon musk can really
get rid of bots because he says that's
one of his his main things
um my truth
social name is scott adams truth
all one word is scott adams truth
so i just signed up if you're just
joining us
poison pill i don't know
shorts to cover
uh
yeah you think so do you think it's an
investor who's doing it as some part of
a
short or a long position i don't know
but
you're you're underestimating the manual
filtering by the moderators
um
i'm not underestimating that i just
wasn't talking about it
so clearly there is
manual filtering
but
i think even if there were a change in
that
there would be a paper trail
that would be backed up
there would be some internal email that
says you know do this differently
and somewhere it's on the server well i
just don't i just don't think
that they could cover up the crime
so if you think that twitter is like you
know quickly shredding the documents
i i feel like you're living in a world
where it's an embassy
where the documents maybe are only on
paper
so if you shred them they're really gone
i don't think i don't think twitter can
shred its
its backups and its backups
i don't know i think it would be pretty
obvious to discover any problems
so
that's all for now watch out for the
bots and i will talk to you
tomorrow
bye for now
