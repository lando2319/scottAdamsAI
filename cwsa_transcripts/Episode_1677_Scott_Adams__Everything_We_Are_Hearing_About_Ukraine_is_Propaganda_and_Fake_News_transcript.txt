good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight
of human existence it's called coffee
with scott adams
and
do you know what you need to participate
well you got half of it right here
the other half is the coffee but
but because we're a flexible and caring
kind of people
you could have a different kind of
beverage that would be 100 acceptable
you might not be as productive but
that's on you
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
right now i think you would because
you're that kind of people hold on hold
on
have you been working out
why do you look so good
you look a little extra sexy today
if i may say so
and so
if you'd like to take that up a notch
too all you need is a cover of my girl
glasses attack your cells just either
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's going to happen right now go
best one ever
i tell you
i'd like to repeat a statistic
that i got today from the
uh federal bureau of statistics that i
just made up which are
that since i began doing these live
streams
nobody
and i know this will seem unusual
no one has ever died while watching the
live stream
nobody
right now think about how many hours and
how many people have watched these live
streams nobody not a single person has
died
during the livestream
so you might be safer right now
than anybody has ever been
that's true
all right well here's some things that
are going on right now in the world
um
i'll start with the good news
there's a researchers at the center for
sustainable and circular technologies
uh they came up with a way to basically
melt plastic into
chemicals that they can reuse and resell
so now they have a way to
possibly looks pretty promising
economically recycled plastic you could
you could recycle it before but it
wasn't economical
uh it has to do with uh they can now
melt it down without heat they could do
it with a chemical process
now is that a big deal
well it feels like it could be a big
deal don't we make a lot of stuff out of
plastic
what happens if you can melt down all
your plastic
and turn it into
3d printer material
is that coming i don't know could be a
lot of things coming
uh and you know that there's there were
breakthroughs in the co2 farming you
know the ability to suck co2 out of the
air and then
chemically transf transform that into
some useful things you can sell
you know that through a breakthroughs in
fusion this year
and we know that there was a invasion of
russia which has a lot to do with energy
prices and we know there was a
pandemic
that caused big differences in
how people live and work and commute
all right here's my question
how many of the things i just mentioned
are included in climate models
do the climate models include in them
any assumptions about
co2 recycling breakthroughs
um
i'm sorry plastic recycling breakthrough
co2 farming sucking it out of the air
fusion breakthroughs
uh
ukraine war which will change everything
about energy prices i don't know which
way
or what's going to happen but it's going
to change things and then the pandemic
which of course changed commuting
patterns rather quickly etc
none of that's in there right
now
let me just say again
this is stuff that largely happened this
year
or ish right
these are gigantic variables
that just sort of popped into existence
nobody saw it coming
all right
did you hear
the biden administration saying that
that there's nothing stopping
domestic production of oil
because there are nine thousand leases
that are available that haven't been
drilled on
nine thousand leases hey if nobody's
drilling on any of those nine thousand
leases
says biden
i guess the problem isn't the government
because they got these 9 000 leases
and then fox news says
which can't be used without permits
so the 9 000 leases totally fake news
what about the part where you can't draw
can't do anything without a permit well
it's fake news until i learn more about
that
so i'm going to say they're both fake
news i think both the story and the
debunk
they both sound like fake news to me
because it sounds like there's some
third explanation
as in
there's a reason that permits can't be
filled or it's some other entity
or
something
so there's more to that story
somebody says the leases are dry holes
in other words there's a lease but
there's nothing under it is that what
you're saying
yeah okay
so i would assume that if it were
economical to uh drill for oil on any of
these leases for whatever the reasons
the reasons might be
too hard to get permits it takes too
long it might be because the holes are
dry might be because they're not dry but
they don't produce as much or the right
thing
so i'm going to guess
if i had to guess on this one i'd say
uh it is a fake news that these are
useful places to drill
would everybody agree
it's probably fake news that there are 9
000 people places you could just go
drill and get some oil
probably fake
that's the way i'd go
all right uh project veritas got a got a
good hit
uh they had some interviews and
your hidden camera interviews with a new
york times reporter who he's an
award-winning reporter so he's notable
person matthew rosenberg and he was
talking about the january 6 coverage and
i guess i think what project veritas
does
their their secret go-to
is if you send a young attractive woman
to have lunch with any male that male
will tell that young attractive woman
absolutely anything
anything
as long as she sounds interested
to me the most interesting part of the
project veritas is listening to the
undercover person
do you ever listen to the undercover
person
because whoever it is it does a good job
and they don't they don't show that
person's face so i guess they can keep
doing this
but the uh if it's i don't know maybe
it's different people each time but the
young woman
is is clearly
indicating an interest in this guy's
profession and like he's just he's just
pouring it out ah man i just pour it out
so that's pretty good model the project
veritas people have
but new york times reporter was saying
that he he attended the january 6
event and he said that
the media
was an overreaction
so he didn't think january 6 was that
dangerous or that big a deal
he was there it didn't seem dangerous it
just seemed like they were having fun
it didn't seem organized this is the new
york times reporter who was there
right so he knows all of the new york
times reporting on it and he was there
and he says it was not organized
obviously
there were lots of fbi involved
he didn't put a number on it but
lots of fbi involved
and
then the coverage was an overreaction
so that's what you get
when a reporter is talking candidly
as opposed to writing for the boss
pretty big difference isn't it
the difference between somebody writing
for their boss and somebody talking on
their own
that's about as big a difference as you
can get on this one
all right
more fake news
are you hearing the reports that the
russian soldiers didn't know they were
attacking ukraine and they thought they
were on training training missions
and when they find out they're walking
away from their tanks
do you think that's true
and to me that sounds so not true
not not even a little bit it sounds
exactly what ukraine wants you to repeat
in the media
hey
why don't you
we captured some of these guys
we got three of them to say they didn't
know why they were here
now granted
you could always find three three
military people who don't know why
they're anywhere they don't know why
they're doing anything it wouldn't be
hard to find three who didn't know why
they were there
or even thought they were on a training
thing
but i wonder if that's the general
opinion
do you think that most of the troops
hadn't heard about a baby ukraine
invasion
nobody heard about that and talked about
it during any of the downtime
i have a real problem believing
a real problem believing
that they didn't know you want some more
evidence of that
putin's popularity since the invasion is
sky high in russia
because
the russians have been told
and they believe by an overwhelming
majority they believe
that it was a it's a legitimate
invasion and then it's a response to
something that they just had to respond
to
so the russian public thinks it's a good
war and they support putin
according to polling
and i guess there's some polling
entities that are more trusted than
others obviously you have to worry about
that
but according to a trusted one and i i
tweeted
a reference to it
clint ehrlich was talking about this how
within russia we fail to understand
that pop that putin's position got
stronger not weaker
because the public thinks that nato is
is the problem
the public doesn't think putin
uh is invading and destroying a cousin
country
they actually think he's saving it
so
imagine this
i i don't think i could describe exactly
the internet
censorship situation in russia
but in general they have access to the
entire internet don't they
can somebody fact check me on that i
mean give or take some specific topics
they get censored of course
but yes they they have access to the
whole internet
and with access to the whole internet
putin could still convince them
that they were in the right to invade
ukraine
think about that
now when i told you that did you say to
yourself
wow
how could that ever happen
that all these people with access to the
internet
could be convinced of something so
ridiculous
that putin had a good reason to invade
ukraine
and you say to yourself that propaganda
is stronger than i've ever imagined
well
 you and me too
because how do you know that how do you
know that the russian propaganda is the
wrong one
how do you know it isn't your propaganda
that's the wrong one
how do you know
that it wasn't nato that started this
whole thing
because it looks like they started it to
me
i mean to me it looks like they started
it i actually agree with the russian
propaganda and i'm not i'm not really
subject to it much i mean you could
argue that some of our pundits are
pushing it
but
now of course the you know the story
he's telling there's something about
nazification etc but i don't think
that's exactly
the biggest part of the story i think
the biggest part of the story in russia
is that nato is the aggressor
and on paper nato looks like the
aggressor nato looks like the country
that's taking a
you know a country that could have been
neutral and turning it into a
threatening entity against russia
so
if the first thing you thought is my god
how effective putin is at brainwashing
his own public
that could be exactly what's going on
that could be exactly what's going on
but you don't have any way to rule out
that it's exactly the other way
it's exactly the other way it could be
that the united states
and europe
are completely brainwashed into thinking
that russia is the aggressor
when
we're the ones who did the coup in
ukraine
and we're the ones who wanted to install
nato
in a country that
you know has a let's say a uh a
spiritual connection
to mainland russia in a way we could
never understand
so
um i would say keep an open mind about
whether the russians or the everybody
else are the ones who are brainwashed in
this case the the safe guess is both
right the safe guess is that
nobody knows what's going on
and that the real reasons for any of
this are probably just not even in the
news
might be
some oil companies or some military or
some
long-term plan to degrade russia or
something
but i'm not even sure the public will
ever know why we're even having this
um
retired lieutenant general kellogg was
on fox news
now let me tell you what he says about
how the ukrainians are doing versus the
russians so i'll read you his words now
remember he's a retired
lieutenant general so he would know
about military things
so when somebody with those credentials
talks about military things
they're going to show their work
they're going to give you the reasons
and let's see if he does that
he said every day that goes by and we're
now getting a day 15
uh they're losing this war saying russia
is losing the war in ukraine
okay so he hasn't given a reason or a
source yet but he's just setting us up
now he says they're losing in the
information space where the entire world
to see what's going on to which they say
well
the only information space that matters
to them
or at least the most important one is
russia russian opinion and russian
opinion
is going totally putin's way
so are they losing in the information
space
because i just told you it looked like
it might be our fault
i mean i'm a i'm a consumer of the
information space
so i'm not so sure they're losing there
but maybe you know you can see that the
opinion of russia by a lot of countries
that trade with them is much less so
i'll say that's probably true
that he says they're losing in the
military space
and i'm waiting for the source for this
or a description of why he says they're
being beaten by ukrainians and the whole
world is going what
we thought we thought these guys were
really ten feet tall they're not they're
about five foot five it's almost almost
like there
he goes i hate to say it because i'm
probably insulting the state but it's
almost like the vermont national guard
with nuclear weapons they're not
performing very well at all everybody is
saying that everybody sees it
who does that sound like
everybody's saying it everybody sees it
with no source and no no argument
whatsoever
that's trump
right
this is something that if trump said it
i would have said oh okay
because that's his usual sales
sales
uh you know hyperbole everybody sees it
everybody's talking about everybody sees
it it's good persuasion
but wait a minute this is not a
persuader he's a lieutenant general
where does your information come from
that the ukrainians are winning the war
are you watching the same news i have
i mean i don't think he has secret
sources does he he didn't mention any
but i'm watching the news and i don't
see ukraine winning the war do you
i mean i see something really bad
which seems like inevitably ukraine will
lose i mean if i had to if i had to
place a bat
i wouldn't be betting on ukraine winning
would you
i mean it might anything could happen
but i wouldn't bet on it
so what do you think of this uh retired
lieutenant general keith kellogg
is this a guy who's giving you a
straightforward opinion on the military
reality or was this just propaganda
because it just looked like propaganda
no source no reasoning
didn't try to connect any facts we know
with any predictions
he just he just states it like it's true
and then says everybody's talking about
it everybody sees it
you know i'm okay with a president
saying everybody knows that everybody
sees it
right because this president is a
salesperson in a sense but not a
general the general should be telling us
maybe what's happening actually
all right
rasmussen says that
about 52 of the people polled in this
country
think that uh it's at least somewhat
likely
some say more likely but at least
somewhat likely we're going to enter a
1930s style of depression
how many of you think that
how many of you watching this think we
might be that it's at least
it's at least somewhat likely which is a
weird way to phrase things but at least
somewhat likely
that we'll have a 1930s depression
obviously yeses
well anything's possible
and so i'll go with anything's possible
but here's my counter argument
i don't believe that you can have
that kind of depression when the world
is as connected
as it is now
i mean you'd have to lose the internet
for that to happen i think because the
internet basically tells you where your
problems are and it can it instantly
connects the problem to the solution
and that didn't exist in the 1930s in
the 1930s if you had a problem you'd
have to write a letter
you write a letter to somebody
hey
we might we might need some equipment
that we don't need
please write back
okay maybe they had the telephone but
but my point is everything was in slow
motion in the 30s today what happened
today when we found out that
russia is going to degrade their oil
is it my imagination or did every oil
producing company
instantly ratch out production which we
won't see coming online for a while
but i think we had instant
adjustment suppose
we saw that we were actually going to
run out of gas
imagine that
maybe not in the united states maybe
just our prices would be higher because
if anybody had gas they'd sell it to us
at the higher price
but let's say we got to a point where
ten percent of the world just doesn't
have energy there's freezing to death
their automobiles don't run
like they're you know the lower end
countries just don't have energy there
just isn't any there's nothing they can
even buy because everybody else bought
it
could the internet just say hey all you
rich people
could you just drive 10 less for a few
months and then we'll have not enough
oil for the developing countries
that i think that would work
i think
i i think that if developing countries
knew that the undeveloped countries were
literally just going to starve
because they had no energy at all
that the developing countries would just
immediately say okay if this is real
it would take some convincing to know
that that was real
but it but if it were real i think the
developing countries could take 10 off
their
their use
for a month or two
you know until other sources maybe start
ramping up
i think we could do that so there's a
whole bunch of flexibility and
adjustment
and substitution
in every possible way that never existed
in the 30s so
while you always have to say anything's
possible and the one that the one that
gets you is the one that happens in a
way that's not historical you know
you're always surprised by the new way
that things can go wrong
such as an internet going down that
would be a pretty big deal
but i would say that given the current
situation the odds of a
standard uh
depression are pretty low
now inflation is going to eat at us for
a long time
but i don't know that that will push us
into
the worst so i'm not yet seeing a strong
signal for the worst case
i see a strong signal for
this is feeling sort of like a reboot
that will cause maybe even higher
higher gdp after this
because i think there will be so many
adjustments because of not only the
pandemic but so many adjustments because
of uh russia and ukraine in the energy
world
that all that adjustment is is uh
creates
wealth as well all the activity creates
transactions creates taxes
creates good economies
so i feel as though if we don't have yet
another disaster right after this one
which unfortunately seems to be the
pattern but if we don't
i feel like we're going to climb out of
this pretty well and and climb to a
higher place
so i'm optimistic
in the
uh two-year
two-year window
in it so here's my predictions
two years from now
um things will look strong
for one year i think
you know we're in the fargo or still and
blah blah blah
somebody says scott has a tesla i do not
have a tesla i do not
i might have one one day
but i do not have one right now
um
long story
all right
so poland did something that was either
really clever or not i don't know
but
so there was all this noise about hey
poland
why don't you lend some of your mig jets
to ukraine because they know how to fly
these older jets
and they'll get more control of the
skies and
that could change the nature of the war
but poland said no no we're not going to
get involved because if we do that
russia will think we're part of the war
if we send them our airplanes
so what we'll do
is we'll do what the united states and
everybody is asking
we'll give you some of our migs
but we'll do better than that
not only will we give you some of our
migs
we'll give you all of them
the entire fleet
and we'll fly those babies right into
your airport and you can do whatever you
want with them
now we'll temporarily be using your
better jets which we hope you'll we'll
we'll be able to keep
but
while we're using your better jets will
be better protected
these jets will be your problem and
we'll deliver them right to you anytime
you want them to which the united states
said what
no we don't want the thing we asked for
because the way you're giving them to us
will make it look like it's our fault to
which poland probably laughed and said
do you see our point now
do you get it now
i would not rule out the fact
that poland just did one of the most
clever persuasion tactics and political
tactics you've ever seen
right jack bosovic pointed this out to
me by the way so it's not not my not my
original insight
it looks like
poland used
the technique which i talk about extreme
cooperation
right
you've seen me talk about it right
when when somebody asks for something
you don't want to do you think it's a
bad idea
you cooperate exactly
you give them everything they want and
they'll instantly say oh well okay this
wasn't exactly what i wanted
so
this is the smartest thing that you know
i've ever seen a country do honestly
yeah if the if they did this
intentionally
and they weren't actually trying to help
they were just trying to make it go away
nailed it
nailed it
now there are also experts disagreeing
about whether this air support would
make any difference
i would like to employ all of my extreme
extreme military
experience and expertise to tell you
how many migs are there
i don't see how they can make a
difference to you
does there anybody that thinks
um what are they gonna get a handful
10 or 20
do you think 10 or 20 migs are going to
make a difference
how long would they even last
could they wouldn't they be destroyed on
the ground
don't the migs have to land where are
they going to land in another country
if the migs land anywhere in ukraine how
long are they going to last
russia sees them land
they're on the ground
they disappear in 10 minutes am i wrong
how could you possibly protect them on
the ground
given the
so
i i want somebody to describe to me
how these aircraft make a difference in
ukraine like actually just game it out
for me i want somebody say okay scott
why you don't understand with your lack
of military training
is that if you just had six of them
even though the russians might have i
don't know hundreds whatever they have
if you had six of them you could do this
or that
and that would make a big difference
connect the dots for me
i'm open to the argument
i'm totally open to the argument
somebody says they can be camouflaged
again i'm not a military expert but i
don't think you can camouflage a an
airplane that's being tracked from the
air to the ground
wouldn't russia be able to see every
aircraft
all the way to the ground
with satellites and whatnot unless they
only flew in clouds or something i know
maybe there may be there is some way to
make this work but it's not obvious to
me
they can be protected and supplied
but where are the drones coming from
and and the drones can be
can the drones be launched from mobile
places or do the drones have to use an
airport
drones are coming from turkey somebody
well that's where they're purchased from
but are they taking off from
somebody says mobile somebody says
highway okay so that would be a big
difference you you could easily imagine
how drones could be moved around and
hidden and maybe even launched from some
other country if you could get away with
it
but
i i can't see a jet lasting 10 minutes
all right
hide them in the clouds
maybe i'm thinking about both military
drones and the little ones because i
think
i think even the military ones
[Music]
seriously
see what that's all about
excuse me while i check my front door
for security concerns
just a package
all right
no problem all right um here's what else
is going on uh so biden
tried to call saudi arabia and the
united arab emirates to see if they'd
pump some more oil to make up for the by
the way uh biden administration did ban
russian oil
was it how many days ago was it
when we thought that wasn't a thing
weren't we told that you know we can't
stop buying russian oil
and then they just did and it won't make
any difference
do we even notice it
are you even gonna notice that we're not
buying russian oil it's like seven
percent of our
of our purchases or something
so i don't think it makes much
difference but at least to russia
but uh i guess we got that done now that
i'm going to call that an accurate scott
prediction
because i did predict to you that almost
anybody can adjust to a 10 or 25 percent
anything
you can just always adjust in the
business world and so
uh
looks like uh it looks like i think
we're going to survive not having
russian oil even if saudi arabia and
nobody else
decides to pump anymore so saudi arabia
arabian united emirates
did not take biden's call
well aren't you glad that the grown-ups
are running the country now
let me ask you this
do you think the crown prince
of saudi arabia
the one that that trump
protected
with from the khashoggi thing
do you remember that do you remember how
much trouble trump got in
for sort of
protecting in a sense protecting king
salman and then he got the
he he got the abraham accords done
coincidence is it a coincidence that
trump worked with the crown prince and
got got a
a big deal done
probably not a coincidence
do you think that the crown prince would
not have taken a call from trump
not a chance
if trump calls saudi arabia they pick up
the frickin phone
am i right
they pick up the phone and do you know
why
because trump probably has the goods on
the crown prince
he protected them
of course he's going to pay he's going
to pick up the phone
now that doesn't mean they would have
pumped more oil but he certainly would
have taken the call
i think
um
and i guess the crown prince is taking
calls from putin and so it's pretty bad
but i guess we got some problems with
saudi arabia they want help with yemen
i guess we're not being helpful there
they they think the iran deal isn't
going to be good for them they want
something more in there
they won't help building their own
nuclear bombs i guess we're not helping
enough there they want legal immunity
for the crown prince because apparently
there are lawsuits etc against them in
the united states
if those are the only problems all right
so that's what saudi wanted help in
yemen
something with iran deal
help building nukes and legal immunity
for the crown prince
could trump have made that deal
yes now that doesn't mean it would be a
good thing to do
or that he would have tried
but given these variables
are are these the kinds of variables
that you can't make a deal with
no these are exactly the kinds of
variables you can make a deal with these
are exactly the kinds of things you make
deals with
right yeah we'll help you more with all
these things
and
we'll give you some legal immunity
because you know you're the head of
state so
you know somehow we'll make it work
i think trump could have given him all
these things
and just got some oil but trump wouldn't
wouldn't have had to ask for it would he
because the domestic production would
still be high
so this is like a double trump would
have been better situation
he never would have had to make the call
to saudi arabia
but if he made the call
they would have taken the call
tell me i'm wrong about that tell me i'm
wrong about that i'm not wrong about
that
he wouldn't have needed to make the call
but if he didn't need to make the call
they would have answered the freaking
phone
all right
um i am getting
sick to my stomach over this zelinski
hero
myth churchillian
crap
now independent of what i think should
happen in ukraine so i'm not even
talking about ukraine right now
this is not even about ukraine and their
situation this is only about him
it's only about persuasion
and it's only about how it makes me feel
it actually makes me sick
and the reason is it's so heavy-handed
and i especially see women
praising him
which seems weird i don't know if
winston churchill got a lot of women
praising him
is there something about him that makes
him cute or sexy
to women
and is that like at least half of what's
going on here
but
when i see such blatant propaganda
and i see it working
it sickens me
because i see my own country being
poisoned
by
by his persuasion which by the way may i
compliment him he's really good at it
he's really good at it
so
let me be really clear if i'm talking
about just his technique it's the same
thing i do with trump right you can like
him or love him or hate him or whatever
but if you just talk about his technique
for persuasion it's often tremendous
and zelensky same thing his technique is
my god
i mean valencia's technique
is incredible
because he had all the all the talents
coming into the job right entertainment
talents
so it's not surprising that somebody
with his
qualifications could pull off this you
know hero myth
thing but it just sickens me like i i
and i and by the way usually when you
say something sickens you
you don't mean it actually physically
but i actually do mean it like i
actually have a like almost a
mild nausea
when i think about him does anybody else
have that
it's not no it's not because he's creepy
i don't think he's creepy
it's just that the persuasion is just so
heavy-handed like you could just feel it
just pushing your head down it's like oh
i get it i get it
but at the same time it works
which is doubly annoying
it's doubly annoying that you know it's
propaganda and brainwashing and
it works
even when you know it it still works
that's how good it is i tell you this
about persuasion all the time
that you think
if you know what what tricks people are
using to persuade you
that that's all you need to defend
yourself it's like i know what you're
doing
you're using the old making me think
past the sale trick
i get it you're just comparing this to
uh to something that's way too expensive
well i think this isn't this expense i
get your check and then it works it
works anyway
there's actually no defense against it
and it's it's one of the most
frustrating things about
persuasion is that you can't you can't
defend yourself against it
it is by definition the thing that goes
past your
critical defenses without any friction
so
um
there's this weird story about bio labs
in ukraine
glenn greenwald was talking about it
especially and he tweeted that ukraine
has biological research facilities
and this was according to under
secretary of state victoria nuland
and rubio senator rubio was asking her
if ukraine has biological chemical
weapons
and she's worried that russia may try to
get them so i guess
they might have something we don't want
him to get we don't know the exact
nature of it
uh but then rubio sort of led the
witness and you know primed her to say
by saying it himself first
uh
that she that if there's any biological
attack
newland is 100 sure it would be russia
how could you be 100 sure it's russia
if there's a biological attack
she's 100 sure it's not the ukrainians
how can you be 100 sure
now she does say and i i get that this
part is actually smart
she does say that the russians routinely
do these false flag things so the most
the most obvious play for them the
russians would be to do a false flag
chemical attack
as if the ukrainians had staged the
attack but here's the problem
if the ukrainians used a chemical attack
they wouldn't use it in their own city i
don't think
i mean even if attacked they would use
it on the forces like they would use it
on the convoy or wherever the forces are
bivouacked or whatever the whatever the
words for that are
wouldn't they because i don't think they
would risk a biological attack spilling
into their own um
civilian population
so even if
russia tried to stage a fake
biological attack
i don't know that that would work
because people would say well
you did invade their country
it might be the one time that people
would be okay with a biological attack
well let me tell let me test it right
here if i asked you
would you be in favor of you know
chemical or biological warfare
pretty much all of you would say no
no i'm not in favor of that no no no
but suppose
suppose your own country got invaded
and you had these chemical weapons
and you were only going to use them
against the military of the other side
and if you if you don't you will be
conquered and may be killed
would you use them would you use
chemical biological warfare just on
soldiers not on any civilians but only
on soldiers if they invaded your country
well
i'm sorry to say that i'm seeing a lot
of yeses
a lot of yes's mostly on the locals
platform because they they answer faster
and i'm saying yes is here too
i feel like i might be a yes as well
depends on the situation i mean the
specifics matter but i wouldn't rule it
out i would definitely rule out chemical
weapons in any you know foreign theater
but if somebody's on my land
well let me
let me make it more personal
if somebody uh
does a home invasion and comes into your
house with weapons pulled
and you had a way to
throw acid in the on them and you know
kill them with basically chemical wear
warfare in your own house you just add
some acid see through them is that
unfair
somebody's got a gun and they came in
your own house to do bad things to you
can you throw acid on them
sure
sure
you sure as hell can
you can throw a whole van of acid on
them
self-defense
so
i think russia would actually have a
pretty good false flag case
uh but i don't know if they would get
any sympathy
see what i'm saying
because if russia showed a bunch of
ukrainian civilians
being hurt by ukraine's own chemical
attack i don't know that that would be
believable
because why would you ukraine attacked
its own people but if it attacked
soldiers on the russian side no matter
how bad the the attack was no matter how
many russian soldiers died
i think the world would just say well
they attacked right so i'm not sure it
works as a for as a false flag
does it
it doesn't look like it would ever work
as a full slag
so i'm going to say no
we won't see one
all right um
people are uh quite rightly
criticizing anybody who says that oh we
just have to put up with higher gas
prices
and that's no big deal and if that's all
we have to put up with to fight putin
it's worth it and then smart people
point out
uh not everybody can afford to fill up
their tank and even go to work
at those prices
i mean this is like
an extinction level event
if you can barely afford food
so
um
i think we need to have a little bit
more enlightenment about what this is
really doing to our own
uh lower income people
so i'll just add to the voices saying
that
um
was it two weeks ago
that all the smart people were saying
that sanctions wouldn't really hurt
russia that much
can
do do me a i guess it's a
sanity check or a fact check
but that's right right about two weeks
ago
i think all of the experts correct me if
i'm wrong i believe 100 of the experts
that i heard anyway
i think 100 of the experts said you
can't really hurt russia that much
because you know you're not going to
impact their energy and blah blah
today
isn't it
a hundred percent of people saying this
is going to be devastating to russia's
economy
which is different from will it change
putin's tactics because i don't think it
will
but
yeah i was saying putin wouldn't so yeah
let's get back to my
uh worst prediction of the year
so my worst prediction of the year
is that putin wouldn't attack
do you remember why
what was my reasoning for that my
reasoning was it's obviously horrible
for russia
and that there's no way that putin
wouldn't know
it would be horrible for russia
except that
maybe it won't be
think that putin wins if all he does is
survive
he just has to stay in power
for x number of years
and the sanctions will wear off or
they'll find workarounds and they will
own ukraine
he will be a hero and his popularity is
sky high right now so i think that uh
the russians will blame the rest of the
world for their economy they'll adjust
they'll think putin's a hero he made
russia bigger got ukraine back into the
fold
they will forget the horrors that
happened in ukraine because their media
won't show them to
so they're just they just won't know how
bad it was in
any of the ukrainian cities
i think
uh i think the russian economy is going
to go down
substantially the russian public is
going to suffer a lot
and putin's going to stay in power and
own ukraine
so that's what it looks like now so the
reason that my horrible uh
prediction that he wouldn't attack even
though even when his entire army was
there i thought he could be bluffing
but
i still think he planned it as a bluff
primarily
even the 48 hours to conquer ukraine
even when he sent troops in
i think he was still looking for a quick
capitulation and maybe get lucky and
kill zelinski quickly
so i i don't feel like he was ever
playing for the full war i just think he
had that option in the back
i don't think he expected it necessarily
yeah the us will suffer too
in the short run
um
but it could change everything about how
energy is produced and how countries
interact with each other
but here's the real question
i always assumed there would be a time
when a kinetic war where you're shooting
actual bullets and stuff
would be
impractical
once everybody is connected financially
because because the world can punish
somebody who does a kinetic war
by just taking them out of the financial
system and that would be too much of a
penalty
so i'm watching this one with great
interest because this might be the
turning point
where even if putin prevails even if
putin gets ukraine even if
russia stays together
i'm pretty sure their economy will be
greatly degraded
and so to the and what would be the
lesson that people would get from it
i think the lesson that people get from
it is that it doesn't pay to attack your
neighbor anymore
there used to be a way
that you can attack your neighbor and
make a profit
you know you attack you win you get
their resources
you start taxing them you make a profit
but i think russia is going to be the
proof point
and you know the crossover point where
an economic war becomes
so
so dangerous
that nobody can risk one by attacking
their neighbor with a kinetic army
so
even with uh putin's survival it's gonna
look like it was a bad idea to other
countries but within russia maybe russia
will think it was a good idea for them
somebody says wrong prediction again
maybe
um
this is amazing so this is a clint
ehrlich uh tweet thread
he said that more than 66 percent of
russians blamed the conflict on america
nato or ukraine
and only four percent in a poll said the
conflict was russia's fault
four percent
just think about that in russia only
four percent think that putin is the
cause of the war
what do you think
let me ask you in the comments uh you
get to pick one of these as the cause of
course it's not one cause
but for simplicity
is the cause
putin nato or ukraine
or any combination what do you think who
caused it
nato nato putin nato nato putin i'm just
reading off uh nato
nato nato nato nato nato putin
nato nato nato
pune
nato
uh
okay i wasn't really expecting this
is it just the uniqueness of
my live stream
is that why i'm get
are you surprised
did i did i prime you to think that or
did you already think that
did everybody already
i hope i didn't influence you that much
i doubt i could have i don't think that
could have happened
wow
so
um let me say i'm really
proud of all of you
honestly
i'm proud that the propaganda that
you're receiving isn't
it's not digging in as much as you'd
expect it to
so apparently the russian public is
still more susceptible to propaganda
than
well actually it's not propaganda
because you agree with them
never mind i guess it's not propaganda i
think it maybe russia is just actually
telling the truth in this case
they're not telling the truth about a
whole range of things yeah they're
definitely lying about a whole bunch of
things such as we're not going to invade
but
it might be nato's fault
it might be
the ukraine constitution is the fault
you know
i don't know i i don't think that the
fact that the ukraine constitution says
that they're going to join nato
i don't think that was really the
problem
because you can change anything that's
on paper if you have a good enough
reason
you can hurry up anything
nato was warned that's right they were
warned but you know but that doesn't
mean anything
just because somebody warns you not to
do something that doesn't mean you have
to go do it
um
do you think that anybody infected the
russian
convoy with covet
that would be a dirty trick
all right
so that's all we got now
i think that was the last thing i want
to talk about
um i guess we'll have to find out about
those bio labs and ukraine but that
story sounds a little suspicious to me a
little bit suspicious
um
[Music]
do we still think that the convoy
was stalled by bad tires
apparently they're not chinese tires by
the way
somebody who really knows tires
saw they were from some other country in
the area i forget which one
most russians are not going to say putin
is wrong i think they
they might
yeah well okay i guess we do have to
worry about that in the poll
tires expire in 10 years with dry rot
we admitted to the bio labs they are
ours
somebody says
but you know
i don't know
i heard somebody else say that
every university has a bio lab
is that true
so could it be that bio labs are fairly
common and it doesn't really mean much
of anything
yeah what's in the trucks
i do wonder about that
all right that's all i got for now and
i'm gonna go do some other stuff
because that's the kind of guy i am and
i will talk to you all
later
