join me
well let's look at the news joe biden
has uh said that if we if we don't uh be
more
cautious with the coronavirus that we
could lose
250 000 more people
before january that would be less than a
month
and he said in public that a quarter of
a million people might die from
coronavirus
on top of the quarter million or
whatever it is now that have already
died
now i would like to tie this to a larger
point
the larger point is this that
i believe biden will start to look
worse every day for a long time
and the reason is because he's moving
from a campaign scenario in which
everything's hypothetical
you know hypothetically joe biden would
be great
on these topics hypothetically
he'll make all these changes that will
make you all happy
so when you're running for office you're
running against hypotheticals and
imaginary scenarios
and you can do great in people's
imaginations
you can kill it in imagination and he
did
yeah some people say even got the most
votes
so what's going to happen
if we were to game this forward a little
bit what what are the obvious things
that will happen
just if we just see her wait
well number one obvious thing is that
he's going to start to be compared to
trump
because you can't avoid it every
everything is contrast
right so the news is really uh
reports of contrast it used to be
peaceful but now there's a war
it used to be good weather but now
there's a hurricane so in a way
everything has to be contrasted to make
sense to you
and of course biden will be compared to
trump
and all of his policies because why
wouldn't you it's obvious
but let's go down the list of things
you're going to compare
biden to trump in and see how you think
you would predict it's going to go
take this first example by didn't miss
speaking i think he misspoke but maybe
he thinks it's true
that 250 000 people would die before
january
what's that do to the economy the
economy
is a psychology engine
the economy works well if you tell
everybody it's going to work well
the economy is completely destroyed
if you tell people things are going to
go bad
trump for all of his flaws which his
critics would be happy to point out
understood
that the economy was not separate from
health care
they're all part of this this big thing
and if you don't take care of all of it
you might lose all of it biden is a
little more
you know pocketized it's like well
there's healthcare and then i'll i'll
just deal with this but i don't have to
think about the economy
because that's a that's a separate
question but it's not
if if biden scares the pants off you on
the
virus even if he's right right i'm not
talking about whether he's right or
wrong
but if he scares you what's it do to the
economy
doesn't really help it doesn't help at
all
if trump tells you the economy is great
and getting better
even if it wasn't true when he said it
what's the outcome of that well
apparently he's pretty
convincing on the on the questions of
the economy and people invest
and they buy stock and they spend money
so if you're just taking the the economy
i don't think biden has even the
slightest chance
of in the end looking good compared to
trump
on the economy now the reason is he
doesn't get the psychology right
but he's also looking at raising taxes
now even if you think taxes should be
raised
because you want to fight the deficit or
because you think it's more fair
whatever or you think it will fund
valuable
programs for the public so you might
like that idea
but there's no way it's going to be good
for the overall economy
right the economy doesn't like high
taxes
when when biden starts
putting back some of those controls in
place will that be good for the economy
no
if he starts talking about green new
deal and
defra and you know any kind of pressure
on fracking
is that going to be good for the economy
no so i think
on the economy trump will have a
permanent advantage that will only look
bigger over time because if trump is not
out there doing
you know new things to cause the the
in the illegitimate press to say
bad things about him you'll start to
forget the bad
things in other words the the most
likely
outcome of the trump administration
is that all of the bad stuff he did will
start to reduce in your
your memory because you won't be
reminded of it every day
after he's out of office but every time
we talk about the economy
pundits are going to say something like
you know
trump would have played it this way and
that would have worked
and then you know
i think trump would have he would have
done that a little differently
he might have bullied a little more and
that might have worked
for example all right let's look up look
at a couple more
categories how about immigration um
if joe biden does anything like opening
up an
immigration i don't think he will by the
way i think he's moderate enough that
he'll
he'll have some you know some controls
on immigration
maybe not as much as you wanted but
how is he gonna look if a big
caravans start heading toward the border
could we predict that it is very likely
that gigantic caravans will head toward
the border
during a biden presidency almost
certainly right
almost certainly what will happen if joe
biden either
gets tough with the caravans like trump
or does the opposite what if he lets him
in
how does that look basically i don't
think he's going to look good
in the long run only because of the
nature of the problem
it has nothing to do with whether biden
would do a good or bad job
it's just the nature of the problem
whoever has that job when this problem
occurs
is gonna look not so good it's just the
problem
there's no right way to handle it
they're just two bad ways to handle it
how about north korea probably won't get
better
and people are gonna say uh why wouldn't
you go meet
a tyrant if it calms down you know
the risk of war why wouldn't you go
shake hands with a dictator
if it reduces your risk and and trump is
going to look
like a genius at least in terms of that
specific
question to know that it's a personal
relationship
that made the difference he avoided
nuclear war
or at least the risk of nuclear war with
north korea
with a personal relationship the very
thing that nobody would have said do
in fact everybody said don't do it
what's biden going to do
is he going to keep doing that is biden
going to meet
kim jong-un and try to keep that going
again it's going to be hard to compete
with what trump did on a whole bunch of
stuff
so he's going to be fighting that ghost
the whole way how about trade deals
do you think biden's going to do a trade
deal that's
less good than what trump was pushing
for
well if he does he's going to look like
he failed because it's going to look
like trump was trying to get this
biden settled for much less maybe trump
would have had to settle too
you don't know but it's going to look
like
biden's a bad negotiator so so you can
see just the way
the things are naturally lining up biden
is going to start
with you know his honeymoon phase which
is now
but the only way this can go is bad for
him
i think and it has nothing to do with
whether he does a good job or not
it just has to do with who he's compared
to and the situation
how about i'll give him uh
i'll give him one positive okay try to
keep it positive a little bit
i know you're going to disagree with
this
but just work with me on this if you
wanted to
dismantle antifa and black lives matter
and reduce the importance of the squad
was trump the right person to do that no
no trump was exactly the wrong president
to get rid of antifa because they picked
him as their enemy
he was the wrong person to get rid of
black lives matter because they had
decided
he was the symbol of what they're
fighting against
and you know the squad of course just
uses trump as their
as their boogeyman so trump would be the
worst
choice to minimize those three entities
but biden isn't biden might be the best
choice to minimize them because biden
can't
can't do his job unless he consolidates
power
and he's not going to want to be out
there with you know
antifa and blm destroying cities under
his
watch and the squad he's already going
after so it's obvious he's trying to
diminish the squad and
try to diminish the whole defund the
police thing
so if you wanted less of any of those
entities
i think you'll get less of it under
biden that would be the one thing i
would say yeah
you know if you wanted just if that was
your only problem in the world
i would i would pick biden for that
every time if it was your only problem
all right um tucker was reporting
yesterday in the news reporting
that apparently we've checked existing
blood supplies from
late 2019 and there was a whole bunch of
coronavirus in there
in late 2019 in the united states
so here's here's the thing to make your
head explode for today
everything you've been told about the
origin
of the coronavirus and there might have
been a bat
it might have been a pangolin and it
might have been the wuhan
lab and all that and it might have been
you know
a certain timeline pretty much
everything you've been told is false
now i don't know what's true i don't
know if the wuhan lab
had anything to do with it at this point
but
everything you thought about that is
false
think about that it's the biggest thing
in the world
and everything you know about it was
just now for most of us
those were just facts you know we
treated all that stuff as just well
that's history
we know that this happened there was
this lab and it was about this time
frame and
blah blah none of it was true an entire
most important thing in the world
and none of it was true
think about that when you say to
yourself
is the next story true
think of that when you say to yourself
well a story this big
with so many people reporting that it is
so
well under those conditions it's such a
big story and so many people looking at
it
they must have never you know gotten
close to the truth by now
nope we don't live in that world we live
in the world where even the biggest
story in the world
is just fake news
and if that story can be fake news
what else can be fake news everything
everything it can all be fake news and
probably
is you know that's the uh the gel man
amnesia uh idea that if you know about a
story you know it's
but all the ones that you don't have any
special expertise in
you say well that's probably true if
it's in the news
all these news people say it's true it's
probably true
might be false but it's probably true
reverse that
in the real world all of the news all of
the news
is probably not true like if you were
just going to put a bet down
there's a brand new story it doesn't
matter what it is it's just a brand new
story
it's a big story it's in the news it's
day one
and you have one bet the bet is will
this story still be true
let's say in five years or will you know
in five years it was never true
which one do you bet and i'm not even
telling you what the story is about
you don't even have to know the topic
anything it could be domestic could be
international
could be about war and death could be
about science could be about economics
it's just a new story and everybody
agrees
on the narrative you don't even have a
disagreement
the left believes it's true the right
believes it's true it's just a new story
now you have to put your bet down bet
against it
bet against it every time and you will
be right i don't know
70 of the time you're not going to be
right every time
but a lot of stuff
is just not true all right
uh general flynn retweeted somebody
else's tweet
suggesting that the president trump
should do
martial law to force a re-vote
now cnn is having a panic attack
because a retired general is suggesting
martial law
in the united states and what would
you know you could imagine would lead to
a change in
expected government if i can say it that
way so that's a pretty big deal
but i'm not entirely sure that cnn knows
how twitter works because when you
retweet things
does that mean you agree with them
it doesn't it means it's important
it might mean it's something you should
consider it might mean somebody's just
telling you something's out there and
it's part of the story
that's how i use twitter i don't retweet
things that i
just agree with do you
don't you sometimes retweet things that
are just a story
you know if if a caravan
of ten thousand immigrants you know
crashed through our border
i might retweet that story but wouldn't
be in favor of it
so that's not how twitter works but we
could imagine
it's reasonable to assume that he
wouldn't have retweeted it without
having at least
some empathy for it that's really
maybe as far as you could go you don't
want to go into full mind reading
but here's a question i have for you a
question for the lawyers
for some reason i have a gigantic lawyer
following i don't know if you do that
but there are probably more lawyers who
follow me than just about anything
which makes sense because i talk about
persuasion
if you're if you're an attorney you
probably want to pay attention to
anybody who talks about the topic of
persuasion because
that's your job but let me ask this
lawyer question
can there be a limited martial law
does it work that way can you say i'm
going to declare martial law but it's
not like some general martial law
it's just going to be this little narrow
one topic
just martial law about the election and
and the martial law will specifically
say we'll redo it
on some timeline is that even possible
i'm not recommending it again talking
about the news
is not endorsing the news i'm talking
about the news
but can somebody tell me a lawyer
if you can limit uh
limit this martial law idea to a single
topic
is it even a thing is that a thing
well you know actually uh let me answer
my own question
if you imagine that martial law was a
generic order that just
puts the president in firmer control
without the
you know the subsidiary uh
government processes i suppose the
governor
the president could pick and choose you
know where he
enforces it so the government could say
it's martial law in general
but you can ignore the in general part
the only part i'm going to care about or
do anything about
is just the election i guess he could do
that
right he doesn't have to use all martial
law
mechanisms he could he could declare it
and then just use whatever party wanted
so i don't know how how constitutional
it is or how practical it is i'm just
going to put it out there
as a thing that's being discussed
i am not i'm not endorsing it at this
point
i don't know if any of you do but um
i i would not endorse martial law
at this point there might be a place
where that
is more of a something to consider but i
don't think we're there
um all right
so democrats keep uh
trolling me on twitter they're dropping
into my
into my twitter feed and they're saying
sarcastic things
such as oh scott uh wasn't it about two
weeks ago
you said to us wait two weeks
you're gonna see some strong evidence
for the accusations
of election fraud it's been two weeks
scott
so where's all the evidence scott
you said it was coming where is it
where's all that evidence
come on come on scott where's all that
evidence where is it
show it to us that's how they act that's
my
that's my impression of every democrat
troll and here's my answer to the people
who are saying where's all that strong
evidence you'd say
so i tweeted an answer so it'd be in the
record i said
democrat trolls keep asking me where's
all that evidence
of election fraud i said would be here
by now
i had to break it to them that they will
never see it
because democrats
don't get to see real news it's just not
an option
and when i made that prediction i should
have modified it by saying
well republicans will hear it because
republicans hear the news on the left
and the right
so republicans will hear the good
evidence and have
if you're watching the if you're
watching the live
witness testimonies i don't know if you
can need more evidence than that
now whether or not those witnesses all
collectively have enough of a story to
change the
outcome of the vote i doubt it you know
i did i didn't see enough happening
that just their testimonies by itself
would change any outcomes but
can we say there's no strong evidence of
fraud
i would say at this point with that many
with that many witnesses
i think you could say there's a 100
percent
bountious plenty of evidence
some of it won't be true some of it will
be people who saw things
and misinterpreted it some might be
lying
some might be who knows disinformation
whatever
but you certainly can't say there's no
evidence
and you can't say it isn't strong if
it's
eyewitnesses with the same stories
and hundreds of them what exactly
you know you can imagine that it would
be like a murder on fifth avenue i'll
just use fifth avenue to
complicate things there's a murder on
fifth avenue
there are hundreds of eyewitnesses
hundreds
of people and they tell the same story
yeah we saw this guy
kill this person right here what would
democrats
say about that hundreds of eyewitnesses
telling the same story of the same event
i believe they would say
where's the proof yeah you got people
saying
that people could say anything where's
your proof
well i'm pretty sure that hundreds of
eyewitnesses
to a murder would be enough to convict
you
i mean i think that goes way beyond
your reasonable doubt you're going to
get pretty convicted
with that many witnesses so why is it
different for the election fraud well
the difference is
that the democrats have packetized their
crime
so that you can see a lot of it with
your own eyes
you can just observe it but you can't
know
how much there was
you can't know you can only know what
you're seeing
you don't know how much other stuff you
didn't see so that's
that's the catch is that the courts
won't reverse an election
unless you can make a case that the
number of votes you can prove
were fraudulent would do that and that
would be nearly impossible
did you see the interviews with the two
postal contractors who had
pretty specific stories that make it
sound as if at least the the one of them
i was listening to
he tells a story where it sounds like
he drove a a large
truck across state bar borders with
what are allegedly fake ballots to
change the outcome in pennsylvania
drove it all the way from new york to
pennsylvania now
and that he's got some kind of a story
where he parked the truck he was told to
park the truck
somewhere different and when he woke up
in the morning his truck was gone
or something
so let me give you my my take on this
story
i don't doubt that we live in a world
where elections can be stolen by
somebody driving gigantic
trucks of stolen ballots i don't think
that's impossible
that that is within the realm of things
that could happen
somebody's correcting me that the
trailer was taken not
not the truck that was pulling it i
guess so he says the trailer was gone
so that's a correction the trailer was
gone not the trunk and he doesn't know
where he went
now would you believe that story
do you believe that story i've got a
problem with that story
and the problem is what is my problem
if you've been watching me for a while
you know exactly what i'm going to say
right
most of you are saying they're very
credible but what is my complaint with
their story
let's see if you know because if you
don't know
what i'm going to say i'd be
disappointed because you should know by
now exactly what i'm going to say
here's the problem a little bit too
on the nose right
a little bit too clean yeah
i'm a whistleblower and i drove this
truck
and then it disappeared the trailer part
disappeared
it could be true i would like i said
it's in the
it's in the realm of possibility
cleanly in the realm of possibility
but it's a little too clean if you know
what i mean
a little too clean for my taste now
i'd like to say you know back up to
something i said from the very beginning
of this whole mess 95 of the evidence
you see
won't be true 95
so if somebody presents a new piece of
evidence in this context
and you don't you haven't even looked at
the evidence yet
what odds do you put on this new piece
of evidence
95 percent chance it's not going to hold
up but that doesn't mean
anything about whether or not the
election was stolen
it just means that confirmation bias
kicked in
as you would expect if there had been a
real theft of the election
that there would be a whole bunch of
confirmation bias where people are sure
the election was stolen
and so therefore they see it everywhere
so the way a normal brain works
is that if you're pretty sure it's true
you're gonna see the proof even if it's
not real
so that's why the 95 percent because you
can predict
just easy to predict that 95 of the
evidence will be confirmation bias
always that doesn't mean in any way
that the five percent that could be real
is tainted by the other 95 it shouldn't
be
like they're just different things one
is people having a mental
you know basically an illusion and the
other is actual evidence
they're just not the same thing so one
should not pollute the other but in our
minds they do
that's the persuasion of it is that
every time one of these gets debunked
the democrats can say well there you go
there's another one c c it was just
confirmation bias
so i'm still on the side that says it's
obvious that the
election was stolen and it's obvious
without evidence
if you don't see that
you haven't been alive for the last
several years
it's obvious without evidence now when i
say that i don't mean i'm looking at the
outcome i'm not looking at
i'm not looking at joe biden's 80
million votes and say well it's obvious
it's obvious that couldn't have been
happened i'm not saying that i know some
of you do say that's obvious but
i'd say it's possible it could have
happened it's not i was
again it's not outside of the realm of
possibility
so it's possible here's what i mean by
it's obvious it was stolen the
motivation was sky high
and the opportunity which we know from
the witnesses
the witnesses have at the very least
established there were lots of ways to
do it
we don't have to wonder anymore was it
possible
oh yeah it was possible it was more
possible than anything you've ever seen
in your life now i don't know if it was
easy
but in terms of practical and possible
yeah yeah so you have sky-high
motivation
you have complete opportunity and you
have
you know a big payoff and low odds of
being prosecuted because everybody's
doing a packet
so as long as your role in the alleged
scheme was you know you just do this
little part
even if you get caught even if you get
caught it's not that big a deal
because you just did a little part so
i would say there's a hundred percent
chance there was an attempt
to steal it um
you can't say what the size of it was
but you would really have to be an idiot
to think it wasn't at least attempted
to steal the election i mean how dumb
would you have to be
to think democrats didn't at least try
now a week ago i think you could be
forgiven
a week ago you didn't really have yet
the evidence of the witnesses
telling you how many holes there are in
the system
and if you know my smart democrat friend
that i talk about all the time
his belief and other smart people who
have
argued with me recently their beliefs
are that
you could know the election was good
because number one you don't
you don't have a court case that has
proved it was bad and number two
it couldn't be that easy to cheat at
such a big scale
you know you wouldn't get away with it
it's not really something that could be
done
but now we know that's not true at the
very least
we've proven that our election system is
completely vulnerable
to all kinds of influences so it's
opposite of what you started with which
is it's probably pretty secure
and now i think we have a better
understanding that it's not even close
we're not even the same conversation
with security
it is the it's just a swiss cheese
that's all it is
so if we didn't get an attempt to steal
an election in that
context i don't know anything about the
world
i don't know anything if they didn't try
to steal that
whether i could ever approve it or not
um
now what do you think are the odds that
after this georgia
senatorial election the runoff what do
you think of the odds
that the two republican candidates will
win
and then sometime late in the night a
truck of misplaced ballots
will show up to reverse the outcome
if you had to put a bet on that what's
your bet
for the late truck
of ballots that changes the election
let me ask you this if they did that
if this plan changed the presidential
election
why wouldn't they do it what would stop
that
now you might be saying to yourself well
we're going to be watching for that does
that matter
does it matter that we'll be looking for
exactly that thing
it doesn't because the entire election
we had witnesses you know coming out of
the wazoo
but did any of those witnesses stop
whatever was happening from happening no
so witnesses don't make any difference
it doesn't matter if you expect it
that's what the witnesses are there for
they're expecting some
mischief i guess expecting is too strong
but why wouldn't they
you know you think to yourself uh scott
that would be a little bit too
obvious but
they know they can get away
with being too obvious you would have
said
maybe you know a few months ago you
would have said to yourself well you
don't want to do a gigantic
crime like a gigantic crime and
also be obvious when you do it would
though
wouldn't those be the two things you
would never do at the same time
don't do a huge crime and make it
obvious
but i think we just watched that happen
i think we're just watching
a gigantic theft of an election it does
feel obvious
now that we know that there are so many
holes in the system of course
of course they tried
so i don't believe there is any
disincentive
for them not to try again under the
assumption that it worked before and
they knew it worked before and so
why wouldn't they why wouldn't they
um senator perdue is one of the people
running for the runoff so there's a
story about his uh
stock uh transactions that i've been
laughing about all morning
i shouldn't laugh about it but i will
so this is what they're saying about him
that
he's one of the most active stock
traders
and of course the the implication is
that some of these trades had to do with
things that his committee
would know about and therefore was there
any kind of insider trader going
trading going on here's his defense
so his defense is that
that he uses that his financial advisors
make every call so he's not he's making
not making these trades
by his own decisions his financial
advisors they make every call
and that quote outside independent
financial advisors
continue to be the only individuals
making transactions
all right so he's basically saying you
know this isn't me
i've delegated management of my
portfolio to these independent financial
advisors
and those independent financial advisors
traded in the last uh six years since
he's been in office
they've made uh 2600
stock trades now
everybody who you know has a background
in
investment and and sort of understands
this field
you're laughing aren't you
you're laughing right now because here's
the funny thing
should we should voters treat senator
perdue harshly because of the suspicion
that some of his transactions had some
insider
element to them well we don't have proof
of that
right there's no proof and nor have i
seen anything that looked you know
directly like it would be proof
but what do you think about the fact
that a sitting senator would delegate
his portfolio
to somebody who would make 2600 trades
in six years
let me give you some advice if your
financial advisors
are handling your portfolio and they
either make on your behalf or
or they even recommend 2600 stock trades
in six years
you need to fire those advisors like
really really quick
because this would be evidence of a
crime
if your financial advisors make 2600
stock
trades on your behalf and you didn't
approve them all
like you weren't really involved they
just happened
this is evidence of a gigantic financial
fraud
being perpetrated against a sitting
senator
who if he believes that 2600
transactions
is somehow good for him as opposed to
obviously the financial advisors are
getting you know some some
benefit from the work they're doing from
him this is evidence of a major crime
against the senator because
let me tell you how many stock trades
there should have been
in six years i'll just give you a range
maybe in six years let's say it's a
pretty big portfolio
maybe 30
30. so the right number if they had been
doing
real work and they were legitimate
financial advisors and they really had
the customers you know best interests in
mind
the right number of trades in six years
maybe 30. could have been zero
right do you know how many stock trades
i've made in
six years because i have you know my
portfolio is probably
you know at least in terms of this
conversation
comparable to the senators how many
stock trades have i made
i'll work off a memory but
10 maybe 10 in six years
because investing is buying and holding
that's what investing is do you know
what do you know what it is
if 2600 trades are made in your name in
six years
well it's not investing i don't know
what you'd call that
you could call it a speculation you
could call it gambling
but it's not even close to investing so
the fact that he thinks he has financial
advisors who are investing for him
he doesn't have that he has somebody
who's ripping him off
and i don't know if he knows it
so that's the strangest story of the
morning
don't ever let anybody trade 2600 times
under your name
some german influencer came over to uh
dunk on me today
so there of course uh you know the rest
of the world is watching our election
situation
and this german woman who had some
standing in germany i don't know she's
semi-famous over there uh said that i'm
basically tilting at windmills and uh
you know in this hopeless attempt
to suggest that there's a way for trump
to remain
in office and
you know because it's basically
impossible at this point is her point
and i i had to point out that that is
the most loser philosophy i've ever
heard in my life
all right so here's somebody in germany
who is observing
me talking about the president and
specifically i was talking about the
fact
that the voting machines don't have an
audit ability
and i've said that if your vote is with
machines that can't be audited
you have to throw out the vote to me
that's
there's no room for compromise there if
you tell me yeah we don't know if the
voting machines worked or didn't
but let's keep the vote well that's just
crazy
that's crazy you would never do that no
no reasonable person would do that
you'd have to know you could audit them
to even know if you had a vote
so that was my point strong point
and she said that i was fighting
you know in something impossible but
here's the irony
how does this woman in germany know i
exist
now she referred to me as the the
dilbert guy but how does she know i
exist the reason she knows i exist
is that i have a track record of doing
things that are really really unlikely
becoming a cartoonist a famous cartoon
is very very unlikely
and then pivoting to what i'm doing now
to the point where somebody in germany
is talking about my political opinions
that was very unlikely
so and then i'm talking about trump
and what is trump's history his tr his
history is doing the impossible
getting elected in the first place
project warp speed
looked impossible by the way that's
another thing that is going to make
biden look like an idiot
do you believe that a president biden
would have made
warp speed happen or would he have
listened to the experts
who said it's going to take four years
and then joe biden who really really
listens to the experts
would have said well i'm not going to
overrule you because you're the experts
and you just every one of you 100 of you
just said
you can't get this done in less than
four years so i guess we wait four years
imagine that what did president trump do
experts said that's going to take four
years and he said give it to me in
six months and the expert said can't
can't be done
i'll tell you one thing there's no way
to do that and then the president said
some version of i'm
assuming do it anyway
you will do it find a way do you need a
few billion dollars
here's the check are you losers
are you telling me you can't save the
country because you're not going to work
hard enough
you're not clever enough make it
happen
i think that's what trump did i think
trump just said
uh you experts are full of make it
happen
and then they did can you can you even
imagine in your wildest
imagination that biden could have gotten
that done
no and i think that's going to be
increasingly obvious
as time goes by you're going to look at
the middle east and you can say
could joe biden have gotten the middle
east where it's at now
no there isn't even the slightest chance
because he would have been pro iran and
none of it would work
all right um
so both trump and i have a long history
of doing things that other people
thought were not possible and this
german influencer is mocking me for
doing things that look hard to do such
as
changing the result of the election now
i'm not going to predict
that it will change but i will tell you
that if you're mocking
either me or trump for imagining that we
can be involved in something that other
people think is hard to do and
unlikely or impossible well you're not
really paying attention
because we've both done that enough that
you should give us a benefit of a doubt
let me put it this way well this will
sound like i'm comparing myself to him
so i'm not comparing myself to this next
person
i'm just using it as an example if elon
musk
starts a company tomorrow a new company
that everybody else said will never work
who are you going to bet on
you could bet on elon musk doing yet
again
something that everybody said it
wouldn't wouldn't work or are you going
to bet on the experts
all right if you're smart you'll bet on
elon musk
doing what everybody said can't be done
because he's got a history
i started using the word bully to refer
to
our new system we used to have a
republic but that's been replaced with
what i'll call a bulliocracy
meaning that the vote was largely
controlled by people who use
physical intimidation and bullying
now physical intimidation and bullying i
consider violence
because even if you don't see a physical
mark on the body
a person who experiences physical
intimidation
and bullying even if it's psychological
is damaged it's permanent damage
you just can't see it because it's it's
a mental uh
sort of damage so the first thing i'd
say is that we did not have
if if biden you know continues on and
becomes
president we will not have had a
non-violent
transition we will have experienced
a violent transition which is the only
reason the transition happened
if you took the violence out of the
process the violence being
the bullying at the vote counting
stations you probably wouldn't get the
same
result now i don't know if that would
change the election entirely
but the vote would be different
and i and i would say that we have
actually lost the republic
already and somebody somebody in ireland
tweeted at me and said that they're
watching the united states
because if democracy is lost in the
united states
europe is toast so that's what he
thought
now there there's something to be said
for that view
but here's the thing he was acting as if
we might lose democracy in this country
he's missed the point democracy is gone
we are living in a bulliocracy the
result of the election wasn't based on
democracy it wasn't based on you know
the republic
it wasn't based on the constitution so
the the guy who's worried that we will
lose democracy in the united states you
need to catch up with the news
we lost democracy or you know
the the republic we're trying to get it
back
i do think we can i do think we can get
it back so it's not like the end of the
world
but we don't have it now it's lost
we're trying to get it back i think we
will
do you want to live in a system here's
my uh
here's my weapons grade persuasion
and someone who's a good persuader a
trade and persuader pointed out that
i guess i'd use the word bully once and
it kind of stood out as more more punchy
than other
than other words so i'm going to use it
again and
so i asked this question by tweet do you
want to live in a system in which
bullies
literally physical bullies decide who
will be president
you are living in that system
right now according to hundreds of
witnesses now if the hundreds of
witnesses
who allege there was this physical
intimidation
if they're all wrong then maybe we still
live in a
in a democracy but i don't think they're
all wrong
you know even if some of them are so
we're living in a bulliocracy which is
quite ironic
all right um
uh so we now it sounds like uh
the representative from uh alabama
uh to mo brook says it
said he's going to challenge the vote in
in the house but only if there's a
senator that joins with him
now i can think of two senators who
might want to
join in with uh mo brooks to challenge
the
the outcome of the election and those
two would be the georgia republican
senators
loffler and perdue because
you would sort of expect that they would
like to make their election
about trump because you're going to get
a bigger turnout
so in effect they could make the georgia
election
a presidential election so if either
loffler
or purdue were to say yeah you know
i think we'll join in on on this and
throw the i don't come with the election
into doubt which could end up with
president trump back in office
if it if it turns into turmoil turmoil
in the house
and so mo brooks just needs one senator
to say yes just one
how close are we to trump being in
office for a second term
if you only need one republican senator
to say yeah i'll join you mo brooks just
one
and then it becomes a house kerfuffle
now this is the part i heard two
different stories about this but my
understanding is
my understanding is that if it comes to
a vote in the house
that they just get one vote per state
which would mean that republicans win
because there are more republican states
so correct me if i'm wrong and i think i
must be
i must be wrong because i don't see this
in the news
but are we really just
one senator a republican away from
saying
yes and that would put trump back in
office
are we actually that close to that
outcome
that literally senator cruz would just
have to do this
just raise his hand and trump would be
in office for a second term because i
feel like i'm not understanding
something here
because if that were true
wouldn't that be the only thing in the
news
right would there be any headlines on
anything else
why why is this sort of getting the
you know the soft treatment because i i
think i'm i'm misunderstanding it right
and my misunderstanding that mo brooks
plus one senator
could cause enough of a problem with the
election result
that would go to the house and then it
would be one vote per state
i think that's the part i might be
getting wrong can somebody confirm that
to me
because it can't be that we can't be
that close
to a president trump for a second term
without that being the only headline
so i would think the uh the obvious ones
senators if somebody's gonna say yes
would be ted cruz
ted cruz would be the obvious one you
know he would be the most
i think the one with the most weight
if he really wanted to make that happen
but the georgia senators they've got a
special interest too
here's my bottom line on what people are
thinking about this election
i can totally understand if there are
democrats who feel
that the election was not stolen that
wouldn't be crazy
i feel it would be uninformed but
it's not crazy there there are also
democrats who would think well
we'll never know how much fraud there
was or wasn't
but we don't see evidence that it's so
much it will change the election
so let's just sort of get over it and
move on with life
that's kind of reasonable i wouldn't
agree with it but
it's reasonable all right here's not
here's what's
not reasonable if you don't think
that if you don't think it was possible
that the election was stolen and you
don't think that the motivation
to do that thing that was very possible
was sky
high you're a idiot
you are so dumb now that doesn't mean it
happened
but if you think it's not possible
and you think the motivation wasn't
there and people willing to do it
you're really dumb i mean you're
seriously dumb
you're like you're like rock dumb
you're like not even human that's so
dumb
that's dumb beyond any level of dumbness
you could ever
have but again it doesn't mean that
they're wrong if they think that the
election
you know actually went to biden they
could be right
all right the cdc director said
it looks like the data says that opening
schools if you're careful
can still make sense
and is that not trump
being right again so what's biden going
to do
when the cdc and the experts all say
you know trump is really right about
this opening up schools
does that make biden look good again i
don't know
maybe if he says i'm listening to the
experts it all works out
blake masters who has the best name
of any human being imagine naming your
kid
i guess the last name is automatic but
imagine naming your kid blake masters
is that kid not automatically going to
have a pretty good life
i feel like if somebody came in for a
job interview
and i saw their name on the you know on
the resume it was
blake masters i'd be like well okay i
think we're done here i got to hire that
guy
i mean his name is just so powerful
it's just this perfect name blake
masters
anyway he said arizona is in philly
but i guess he lives there and he says
but we do use dominion voting machines
the secretary of state has the blm
hashtag in her bio
and she calls trump supporters neo-nazis
seems bad so how much do you trust your
election
when they have dominion voting machines
the secretary of state
is a black lives matter supporter and
calls the other side neo-nazis
i would say that that does open up the
possibility
of a little fraud possibility doesn't
mean it happened
possibility all right here's my last
topic
there's a cool thing happening in crime
fighting right now
worthy of note that it's been
sort of uh what would you call it
privatized
because it turns out that there are some
new technologies
that would solve a bunch of crimes but
you know the local police forces et
cetera are
sort of slow to adopt new things and if
there's a budget
implication then they could be really
slow right
so there are now crime fighting
technologies
which if we could afford them and we you
know the police departments incorporated
them
they would solve a whole bunch of new
crimes i mean it would just
immediately solve all kinds of stuff if
they could afford it
so the the interim solution
is that this company otherum which i've
talked about i've had a guest on here
so they can look at the dna uh from a
crime scene
and they can find a family connection
which is the new part of the tech
technology so these days there's enough
dna
you know in the world
in databases that they can find a family
member
and if you find a family member you can
pretty much always find
the person after that so othram
would simply need the police departments
to say here's some money
to fund your project to you know do your
little work there
and so they started to do crowdfunding
so the so right now authorum will work
with a local
law enforcement and the two of them will
agree to start a little gofundme i think
it's go funding
and if you fund it othram will go solve
the crime
did you see that coming did any of you
predict
that we would have a gofundme to solve
crimes and that it would work
here's here's the kicker how often will
it work
well with the off the other example it's
close to 100
so if you give money to one of these
crime solving things
it will actually solve the crime and you
know there's an active one now i tweeted
about you can see it in my twitter feed
from yesterday
so i would think that if the gofundme
concept proves that the technology
solves crime
it would be only a matter of time before
the local law enforcement would
find a budget for it and include it
who who controls the dna machines
the dna machines well i don't think
there are
dna machines ah
all right did i listen to the trump
speech yesterday i did not
i did not listen to it i understand
there were many accusations which
his critics say have been debunked
which is what i would have expected so
i didn't didn't feel i need to listen oh
let me defend myself
on one thing today so um
the witness testimonies yesterday
included the the blonde woman that i was
complimenting yesterday now somebody
who's an anti-trumper tweeted a little
clip of her talking
in which um we don't know the truth
so i'll talk about the perception
so only talking about the perception the
perception is
she looked inebriated when she was she
was talking in public about
what she witnessed in terms of fraud at
the election
vote counting sites now i feel
that that was worth retweeting not
because i want her to have less
credibility
i don't and i don't think that if she
had a drink at lunch and i don't know if
that's true
it could be just her normal personality
as some people were suggesting
but the point is to the untrained eye
somebody who doesn't know her personally
she looked inebriated
and that's part of the story so
if you're trying to judge how people
received her or whether they
whether she was being judged as credible
unfortunately that's part of the story
now
i don't want that to be true and i don't
want anything bad to happen or any
reputational problem to happen to this
woman who i consider
a patriot and i also don't care if she
had a couple of drinks
at lunch because she's got a really
stressful thing she's doing she's
probably getting death threats and
everything else
so if she needed a couple of drinks for
lunch to finish her story
i don't have any problem with that but
it is part of the story
part of the story is that she
she left an impression which is part of
the
the credibility um conversation
so i apologize
if anybody thinks i was dunking on her i
have complete respect for her
as a patriot as somebody who's taking
you know she's painting a target on her
own back
to do what she's doing so she's
sacrificing for the country
for the country there's nothing in it
for her it's all downside for her
in fact you know could this be a better
example if it's all downside for her
it's all downside for her pure patriot
sacrificing for the country i love that
woman
i love that woman so she's my hero
but she may have had a drink at lunch
it's just part of the story
there's no reason to ignore it and as i
was telling people who were
criticizing me for retweeting that i'm
not a cnn
cnn might ignore an uncomfortable part
of a story but i don't need to do that
i can tell you the whole story i don't
need to keep
news away from you to protect you
and there are a number of people who say
you know that that's a misinterpretation
and that that was just her personality
could be
i i i don't rule out the fact that she
was just being her
um dems will
cut or break line somebody says well i
don't know about that
all right enough for now
all right periscope's gone you've got me
for you've got my full attention for a
moment here
um somebody says i did love her hair
angela says i liked it too
i liked i liked her hair that's a weird
thing to say but i was having the same
the same impression she was a very
likable character wouldn't you say
like you you know she's she's sort of a
lively
interesting person um
i'm always amused when random racists
come into the uh
comment thing and just say it's insanely
racist
stuff and act like an
act like maybe other people are going to
say yeah
[Music]
she doesn't seem credible to be somebody
says
you know i i'm going to say it again but
i don't think you should take any
individual story
as as the credible one i think you have
to look at them as a
as a group
were you invit were you surprised the
democrats didn't get better persuasion
advice i was a little bit
yeah it did seem to me that the
democrats did not have
a professional persuader working for
their team
unless they didn't do as good a job this
time but it didn't look like they had
the same kind of talent that hillary had
persuasion-wise
senator all right that's all for now
and i will talk to you tomorrow
