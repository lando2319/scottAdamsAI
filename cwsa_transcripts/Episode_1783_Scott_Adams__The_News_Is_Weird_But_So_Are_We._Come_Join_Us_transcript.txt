be prepared
well i think it's time
i think it's time for the best thing
that ever happened to you it's called
coffee with scott adams and
if you went someplace else to watch it
you were in the wrong place
but those of you who are watching it now
wow
have you chosen correctly and not only
that
but it's going to another level yep all
you need is a copper mug or a glass
a tanker tells us time they can't eat
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope meaning of the day the
thing that makes everything better can
you feel your dopamine and oxytocin
starting to spike probably
probably
go
oh favorite
that's so good
so good
well i did a little thing last night
that i don't know if you've ever done
this
it's called not getting enough sleep
wow
i'm really good a day or two without
enough sleep
but
how many emergencies can one person have
after midnight
you know never big ones but always
there's always something that you have
to get up for at midnight there's always
a
lost dog or
a smell or a leak or some damn thing
yes i did have another water leak
problem that's another story
cnn's ratings
continue to plunge
do you know why their ratings continue
to plunge
because their new boss has tried to make
them report real news
without the sensationalism
nobody wants it
[Laughter]
that's the problem
nobody wants it
you know everybody's so smart and they
say you know
why can't the news
give us just the straight news like it
did in the 60s i'll tell you why
nobody will watch it
so cnn is is embarking in an experiment
to destroy their own business apparently
in which they're going to try to be less
sensational
why would anyone watch less sensational
news
if you had a choice
between sensational news
and less sensational news meaning that
the hyperbole would be added or not
which one would you watch
you say you'd watch
the one without the hyperbole
that's why you say
if i did a survey i bet a lot of people
say you know
i don't need all that opinion and
all that exaggeration and bigotry and
one side is right and one side is wrong
i don't need any of that
but if you were given two choices
you would take that as long as it was on
your side
who in the world wants to see neutral
things when they can see victory
because that's what the the news sources
do they tell you your site is right
if you turn on fox news
it is going to be
one story after another
telling you that you were right all
along meaning you as a fox news regular
viewer yep you were right all along
when you warned that if this happens bad
things will happen well here it is you
are so smart
who's not going to watch that
i mean seriously
if you could watch news that's just
somebody did something we don't know
what it means
or we totally know what it means and it
proves how smart you are
which one are you going to watch
i'm going to watch the one that says i'm
smart
i may be small but i'm not unaware of it
all right um
here's the perpetual news news you know
the news that never changes every day
germany is in a gas shortage
uh as andres backhouse i think i saw a
tweet in which he pointed out
the news is that this wasn't already
news
uh
why is germany just preparing for a
shortage because that's the story
germany's getting more aggressive about
preparing the public for upcoming gas
shortages well they're not upcoming
they're already there so there's already
gas shortage
because of russia
now russia says
you have to reduce the amount of gas
not to punish germany
but rather because they couldn't get
equipment from the west that was needed
to keep their
facilities working
what do you think is true
do you think it's true that the one and
only reason putin cut gas production
is to put pressure on the economies
so that they would give him what he
wants
or do you think that he didn't have
spare parts
because that was exactly our strategy to
deny him spare parts
he's kind of calling your bluff isn't he
not yours but
you know so the united states says we're
going to sanction russia and they won't
be able to get
you know any modern spare parts so their
industries that require require western
technology
will eventually crumble
and then
it works
and they can't give spare parts
and so they can't deliver gas
so germany doesn't have enough gas
isn't that exactly what we were trying
to do
am i wrong if if we were
if we were preventing russia for getting
for from getting this replacement
equipment
and there was no exception for the
energy industry as far as i know
weren't we
making sure that germany had a shortage
this year
if you were putin which would you prefer
doing
reducing the gas to germany
and making them
replace your sources maybe forever
or
selling as much gas to germany as you
possibly can making as much profit as
you can
to keep the russian economy as strong as
you can
which one of those would have been a
better strategy
because they're both sort of you know
longer term war strategy
you know one says put a little pressure
on the enemy and you know that'll be one
part of the larger picture of why they
fold
maybe
maybe the pressure on germany's public
will make them fold i don't know maybe
but it's also possible that having
russia
make more money by selling more gas
could be a good thing too
we don't know what's good and bad
anymore we've completely lost the
ability
to know that if something happens
whatever the something is
therefore something else will happen
i just saw a mike cerovitch tweet just
before i came on i'm trying to digest it
as sort of a new thought
and he says i'm paraphrasing
that if you think you know what's going
to happen with
real estate prices
um he thinks you should be blocked
immediately
and anybody who's sure they know what's
going to happen with real estate prices
because one of the things he points out
is that sure you know interest rates are
going up so mortgages are more expensive
so it's harder to buy a house
that makes sense so if it's harder to
buy a house the prices of houses
might go down
but as mike points out
rents are probably going up
because there are more people than
places to live
i think that's the only reason rent goes
up right there are more people than
there are places to live so as long as
that's the case
people are either going to have to pay
more for a rent
or more for a house
so you're always going to have all these
you know counter-balancing forces
nobody's really smart enough to know how
any of this turns out
isn't that weird
do you remember
when we were so smart that we had
learned from the carter administration
what what variables have to be in place
to cause something called stagflation
so it's you know inflation
at the same time you have low growth
which is the two worst things you could
have
and we thought okay now we've seen this
situation we know that when these
variables are in place
you'll get that worse situation
and then the variables fell into place
again
and then nothing like that happened
because it turns out
we're really bad at predicting the
future
we think we know okay these variables
produce this outcome no we don't we
really don't
so what is pretty much
every economist saying is going to
happen next year
a recession right
is there any economist even one
in public
who is saying you know i think we're not
going to have a recession
i haven't seen one of you
have you seen any professional
economist
say that next year you know
maybe not maybe not a recession
i haven't
kramer well is kramer a professional
uh economist
i don't know i guess he's close to it
um
so i'm gonna
i'm gonna do uh
i guess this would be a public
demonstration
i'm going to predict the opposite
of what every smart person is predicting
so every smart person and i admit
they're smart right this is i'm not i'm
not mocking them with sarcasm over the
smart people no they are actually smart
they're people who have
you know phds in economics
done it all their life they're smart
these are really smart people no there's
no doubt about that
and every one of them says recession
so i'm gonna i'm gonna predict the
opposite do you know why
why would i predict the opposite of
every smart person
why
because nobody can predict the future
it's not a thing
it's just not a thing it's probably it
could be a it could be a coin flip
you know next year could be a coin flip
you just don't know there are too many
variables
but here's the strategy
you've seen me do it before
here's the strategy i'll tell you you
know while i'm doing it
what happens if i'm wrong
because i didn't tweet it
nobody'll ever remember
right but if i'm right
i'll take this you know this clip and
pass it around and say well
looks like i was right
so so on a risk-reward basis it makes
sense for me to make this prediction
because if i'm wrong people will say um
you predicted the opposite of every
smart thing in the world every smart
person in the world and he was wrong
that's interesting weird there's
probably something we missed about that
story you'll just forget it
but what if i get it right
if i get it right
you're never going to hear the end of it
now let me put this in context
something like
i don't know
20 years ago or something
i made a prediction that evolution would
be
debunked
in scientific terms in my lifetime
now that's ridiculous right
that's about as close as you can get
oh and i also specified
that it would not be debunked in
religious terms that it would debunk
within the realm of
you know science and logic
now that's a ridiculous
prediction
if i'd been wrong
i would have just said well it hasn't
happened yet
but it will
so i'd always have an excellent strategy
right yeah
well it hasn't happened yet but any
moment now
but then it happened
then um
in my opinion
evolution has been completely debunked
by the simulation
theory now i'm not saying the simulation
theory is definitely the right one
but if you do the math and the logic it
is maybe a trillion times more likely
than
evolution
still either one's possible i suppose
but one is you know a trillion times
more likely i could go through the math
but you've heard that too many times
so
that's the weirdest probably the
weirdest
dumbest prediction ever anybody ever
made
the evolution doesn't exist
because if we're a simulation the past
is only created when you need it
otherwise you don't need it
so meaning that if we're a simulation
there's nothing below the ground until
you see it so if you dug a hole
the the stuff that you were digging into
would only start to exist
as you got near it it wouldn't exist
until you were digging the hole and you
were you were uncovering something
nobody's seen before
so that's the theory
so there's no there's no evolution
because there's no history it's all
imaginary
so
that's my
my prediction
is that the uh
the
and and i'll even give you a why because
if i don't give you y then just
it's even sketchier
so here's why
the why is there too many variables
that we communicate too well
these days
meaning that whenever there's a problem
the internet tells you there's a problem
and then people jump on it because
problems need to be solved
and the problem solvers and the problems
are are connected almost immediately
and so
i'm going to say that because we
communicate better than we've ever
communicated before
that we will avoid a recession in the
united states
in the united states and and i'm going
to take credit if we only have a slight
recession
would you give me that
would you give me if if it's maybe a
tactical recession but it's just like we
just touch it and then then come out of
it
well you'd give me that right that would
be sort of not a recession
you know we just brush it and then
bounce out of it
so that's my prediction
and it's based on the fact that we can
recover and adjust faster than we've
ever
ever done before
we'll see
now if i'm wrong
i'll ask you to forget i ever said this
as quickly as possible because it would
be super embarrassing
no i'm just kidding i never get
embarrassed
i can't remember the last time i was
embarrassed like literally
i can't even remember the last time i
was embarrassed
it really is a superpower
if you can learn
to be free of embarrassment which
somehow i've managed to do i mean it
took me decades to get to this point
but it is a wonderful existence
how many times do you say to yourself oh
if i do this i'm gonna look stupid or
somebody will mock me or
you know forever there'll be that
photograph or whatever i don't have any
of those thoughts ever
i go through i go through my entire day
and never thinking about that
while somebody's going to think about me
later it's wonderful
well here's a small story that might be
a big story
um i've often said that although
although our
billionaire class is often maligned
what would we do without them
it's an interesting question right
sure there are billionaires doing things
you don't like
sure
but what about the ones who are doing
things you like
they're really really important here's
an example
mark cuban has this online pharmacy a
startup
so they're they're selling
pharmaceutical
drugs but they're selling them for i
don't know how but they're selling them
for way way way way less
than you normally could get them
i'm not sure exactly what method he's
using to lower the cost
now they don't have all the drugs that
you could have they're starting with a
you know a set of
popular ones i guess
and they're expanding i think mark cuban
just said he expanded it
but he was responding today to a tweet
from somebody who said that it saved his
life
because he could afford his anti
i forget what the fellow's problem was
but he tweeted that basically the cost
of
some anti
uh
spasm or something drug but anyway
he basically said it saved his life
so mark cuban
starts a company that
at least this gentleman said
saved his life
now who was going to do it
if mark cuban didn't do it right maybe
somebody would have but i i really think
that we underestimate how much impact
the billionaire class is having on our
well-being you just don't realize it you
know you just get mad because they've
got their billions of dollars now i'm
going to give you one more defense for
the billionaires
one more defense for the billionaires
maybe two
billionaires don't spend much of their
own money
you know that right
if you have a billion dollars like how
much does elon musk consume personally
just to you know get by
he probably spends a lot traveling
because he's got businesses he has to go
back and forth that's sort of the
business business expense mostly
i don't know that elon musk even spends
much money on himself
because you know his health care is the
same as everybody else's
he's food like everybody else
he doesn't seem to wear
designer clothing
i don't know if he owns a car
does elon musk go in a car
i mean ironically he owns a car company
but do you think he actually owns a car
i'll bet he doesn't
i bet he doesn't own the car
does he i don't know maybe maybe maybe
there's one in the company name and he
drives it or something
but if you think about how much a
billionaire consumes of their own money
it's nothing
it's eventually a small money amount
that they use on themselves
so he says dude seriously
you can do better than that you could do
better than
dude seriously
i
that's not helping me at all
give me a little bit more a little bit
more
in the comments here
and so i say that about myself i look i
look at all the money i've ever made in
my life
and then i say what percentage of all
the money i made am i going to spend
personally like on my own you know
well-being and the answer is
5
i'm i've never calculated but just off
the top of my head i think maybe five
percent something like that
the rest would go to family members you
know donations
uh trying to invest in companies that
work or don't work but basically it's
being put to use right for other people
you billionaires don't spend their own
money they can
but they hardly ever do
so basically a billionaire has made a
billion dollars for you
i mean you think of it the way
the way things are organized it's for
the billion billionaire right but the
billionaire who makes a billion dollars
is not making it to spend it
you don't make a billion dollars to
spend a billion dollars
it wouldn't even make sense you couldn't
spend it if you wanted to i mean on
consumption you could invest it
so
uh when i see stuff like this like mark
you've been literally saving some guy's
life probably lots of people by having
lower cost farm pharmaceuticals one of
the biggest problems in the country
and so he goes right after it he solves
it
now do you think that he would have gone
into this business
if he were not already a billionaire
maybe
maybe it was just a good business so
maybe what if if he had been you know if
he had to borrow money to do it maybe he
would have i don't know
but
this has the feeling
of something that only a billionaire
would do
you know what i mean because i feel like
somebody would have done it already
if you could do it without being a
billionaire because i it must be high
enough risk
that you'd have to be a billionaire to
even bother taking a run at this i don't
know
we'll see but good luck then
now there's a story
i
i don't know how stupid the news
business thinks the public is
but i think it's reached a new
level and lack of
lack of appreciation for the public mind
now i'm not saying they're wrong
having a low opinion of the public's
ability to think
is not wrong
it's just sort of distasteful when you
see it and
there's no better example
than this story that says that
i think this was in cnn probably
that privately rupert murdoch quote knew
trump lost the election
but because rupert murdoch apparently
allowed or encouraged it's not clear
fox news to talk about the election in
an opinion way
as if there were some questions to it
there's some thought that uh
that there's some kind of smoking gun
here
that rupert murdoch was pushing lies
is that what happened
how could rupert rupert murdoch
or fox news opinion people
push a lie
about the election
when
it's
unaudited
how can you call it a lie when you
simply don't know
and that's what they're selling to the
public they're selling to the public
that if an election
doesn't have an obvious problem that the
courts have verified is a real problem
unless you have that narrow situation
then you can conclude that the election
was completely fair without knowing
anything about it
because
you know if you didn't know this we
don't have a way to audit elections
you can audit elements of the election
like certain things you can recount the
ballots for example but you don't know
what happens when your digits get into
the the computer systems
you don't know what the software is
doing there's no order for that
so if you don't know what the software
is doing
it doesn't really help you to count the
pieces of paper because it turns into
software at some point it turns into
data and if you can't audit the data
after the the pieces of paper have
turned into data
you haven't really audited
so
um
and so you see major stories
by serious people
who will tell you that rupert murdoch
privately knew trump lost the election
do you know who knew trump lost the
election
nobody
nobody
it was unknowable
because at the time of the election
there were no audits that had been
completed
and there's still no audits that have
been completed that are total audits you
can audit elements of an election but
not
not the entire thing
so
and this is sold to us like legitimate
news
can you imagine somebody saying
that
if we have
we have no way to know if something is
true or false
and therefore the people who said maybe
is false just maybe
maybe is false that those people are
definitely wrong and should be condemned
no you should condemn anybody who's
certain
the in this story
are the ones who are sure either way
if you can tell me if you can look me in
the face and say
i am
positive this election was fair
you're a
you're an idiot
like yeah i don't even want to be in the
same room with you you're so dumb
like nothing good could come from this
conversation
if you know
the unknowable and you're saying to me
right in my face i know the unknowable
to do
things that can't be known i know them
because i know the
unknowable all right so if you're
positive the election was fair
you're a idiot
there's no there's no way around it
but
my friends and i say this with love
if you're positive the election was
rigged in a way that's you know big
enough that it changed the
the outcome
yeah you're a idiot too you're
 82.
sorry
sorry
if you're positive
now if you if you have a strong
suspicion
well then i'd say you're a normal person
and i applaud you yay normal suspicion
if you're just a skeptical person and
you say you know i wish this system were
improved so that we could know for sure
well then i'd say you are an awesome
person
you're an amazing person
because you're you know like me
the standard of amazingness how much are
you like me
that's that's how i judge people same
way you do same way you do
but the fact i find it actually
insulting like actually it bothers me
when i see a news story where they treat
it like there could be a certainty in
either direction about something you
couldn't know it's unknowable
and it just makes me nuts
yes they do treat us like we're idiots
but they're not wrong
in many cases
um
so i i tweeted that uh just so i don't
get canceled i wanted
i wanted the world to know
that i was with the majority on this
right so i tweeted that i've decided to
join the majority opinion in the united
states
and uh with this tweet i publicly
declared that i know the unknowable
that our unaudited elections in 2020
were perfectly fair
so i wanted to join the majority who
seems to hold that opinion so
did that publicly
um
i you know there's one confusing thing
about the news today i don't know if you
noticed it
did you notice anything weird about the
stories like the mix of stories in the
news today something strange
did anybody see it
i'm not the only one
yeah okay i think one of you saw two
yeah there were
you know normally let's say they're 25
stories in the news
i saw
out of the 25 or so stories i must have
seen
five or six and a 25
that were not about the trans community
and i thought to myself
what's going on
i i was a little confused because
normally what i expect would be all 25
stories
would have at least an angle
or you know they would frame it to be
about the trans community and today
i think
there i there had to be at least five or
six out of 25 that didn't have anything
to do with trans and
i don't know why
like there's no reason for it is it
is there a reason to leave it out of
those stories
because we've got it in you know we've
got a
elon musk
connection
because one of elon musk's children is
trans
and so through elon musk you connect
that to like everything else from
climate change to space to everything
else
um then there's you know the title ix
story
then there's a story about ellen page
bravely
inserting a trans character into one of
her
products
and i thought to myself
i
i don't see any trans element of the
ukraine war
which might be why it's
if you notice that the war in ukraine
started out to be it was like it's all
the headlines and it like shrunk and
drunk and drunk and today the news on
ukraine is going could be the same news
every day
we're trying to give them more resources
they need more weapons
russia made some gains but the plucky
ukrainians are holding out strong
but there's nothing about trans in that
whole story
and i'm thinking
that's probably why it disappeared
today the story is like ah there's a
city you never heard of looks like
russia is going to take a run for it and
that's it
now imagine if it had been a city full
of the trans community
imagine if there had been only one city
in ukraine
that was like the famous place where a
lot of people in the trans community
went to live
well this would be a different war
wouldn't it news would be all over that
and you know i'm mocking it but
it's hard to imagine anything that's a
smaller problem in the world than the
trans situation and let me be clear
if you're in the situation this might be
the biggest problem for you like as an
individual
but in terms of our national problems
isn't it among the smallest
if you were to make a list of all the
big challenges in america where would
where would the trans
situation be
it would be
very very far down right in terms of
national problems in terms of individual
problems that might be your top problem
or top issue i don't want to call it a
problem
all right
speaking of that
do you all know a famous podcaster ethan
klein i guess he associates more with
the left
and of course you know dr jordan
peterson who some say is associated
too much some say with the right
now i'm not sure that he would agree
with that characterization but that's
what people say about him
and there's a little dust up here
where jordan peterson went after ellen
page
because ellen had said in public i guess
that she was proud
that she had she was inserting a trans
character in the the umbrella academy or
something
some movie project
and
and i guess jordan peterson said
remember when pride was a sin
uh and then he says ellen page just had
her press removed by a criminal
physician
now the criminal part of course is
hyperbole
because it's not criminal if the justice
system does not consider it a crime
which it doesn't
so you should see criminal as you know
hyperbole
and meaning that he's
way far against it and maybe he thinks
you should think about making a criminal
i won't read his mind
but um
so that was the story
and i'm not giving you any opinion on
the story
so
it's opinion about the people who have
opinions on the story my opinion is i'm
i like to throw this in every now and
then because i can be a confusing
public voice
i'm very pro-trans
which is different from saying
therefore i support everything that the
trans community wants no no
i don't support anything that everybody
wants anybody wants
the left the right the trans community i
don't i don't support everything that
every anybody wants
but i support them completely
meaning that
people or people let people choose
let people be free
do people make the wrong choice
probably
i can't think of any domain in which
people don't make wrong choices
can you
but we don't let them not make those
choices
in most cases we still let them make the
choice
i don't think this is different
you know if when i look at it
well when you talk about children you're
really talking about the parents choice
right i'm not i'm not suggesting that
children make adult choices
that's that's really not even about
trans is it i mean it's hard to say
that's a trans issue
that's more of a parenting issue
so
then why is suicide illegal
don't ask me
um
you're talking about school not parents
rights
uh i don't think we disagree on any of
the the stuff about who has the rights
to do stuff i don't think that's worth
getting into we i don't think we
disagree on any of that
we're pretty clear about who has what
rights or who should have what rights
you know i think we all want parents to
have the dominant rights and all that
stuff
um
all right well the the trans issue is is
certainly interesting but let's let's
see what uh ethan lyon said so jordan
peterson made this provocative statement
remember when pride was a sin
now i don't know
i'm not going to try to interpret
exactly what he meant there
because he's smarter than i am
what would be dumber than trying to
interpret
um somebody's words when the person who
said it is smarter than you are
like that you need a little bit of
humility
to try to imagine what somebody is
thinking if they're smarter than you
and uh jordan peterson is smarter than
all of us
and
most of us not you of course not you but
he's smarter than i am
um
i i kind of have my own take on this uh
remember when pride was a sin i'm gonna
i'm gonna give it to you in my own
special way
i've always been
um
weirded out by anybody who is proud
about their situation for which
there's been some bigotry
now i'm a super
pro gay community in lgbtq
but i never understood why you would be
proud of
your sexual orientation i do understand
why you'd not be ashamed of it that part
makes perfect sense but why would you be
proud i feel like just breaking even
would be the the goal here
how about we just
don't feel bad about it
not feeling bad seems like the goal
to just not be bothered by it to ignore
it to make it no longer part of our
decision making that's the goal
as soon as you're proud about it you've
overcompensated
you've just taken one mistake and
replaced it with another one
this is why i've never understood uh
white supremacists
and i think even even uh yesterday i was
accused in public of being a white
supremacist i don't even understand that
here's why
why do i get credit for what strangers
did
because the the the white people who
invented things and
conquered countries and
did awesome things
none of them were me
i didn't do any of that i didn't i
didn't find any countries i didn't
invent anything
well i did but i mean nothing important
so why would i take pride
just as an example why would i take
pride in being white
it doesn't make sense
that's that's taking pride in someone
else's accomplishment
i'm not even entirely sure if i should
be proud about my own accomplishments
but you know i think it works well
if you're proud about what you
physically do in the world and if it's
good for the world that's probably a
positive thing you know you get a little
payoff for doing something good oh i
feel pride
it feels good
but if you're proud of strangers
accomplishments
what is wrong with you
what is wrong with you
to say that somebody is a white
supremacist
is
almost
giving them a pass isn't it it's almost
like giving them okay we will accept
we'll accept your interpretation of
things
and you know just disagree with it
that's not what's happening
what's happening is people are taking
credit for strangers accomplishments
let's just call it out
now if you're going to put a white hood
on and dance around in your white robes
in the kkk
you just told me that you get credit for
a stranger's work the work that
strangers did
because you're a similar
uh
you know
trace amount amount of genetic code
is is similar what
that's ridiculous
so i'm completely with jordan peterson
although my reasons for it might be
different i don't know
i can't be sure
but i don't think people should be
claiming pride for anything you
shouldn't be proud about being gay you
shouldn't be proud about being white you
shouldn't be proud about being black
it's just what you are
how about how about we just stop talking
about it
if it doesn't matter
because it doesn't
wasn't tesla
gay now somebody do me a uh
a fact check
i believe is rumored that isaac newton
was gay
leonardo da vinci
rumored to be
gay right
so
somebody says touring don't know about
that
tesla was not
somebody says tesla was not but anyway
whether they were or whether they were
not
da vinci was it da vinci or michelangelo
or both
i know
but certainly you could go into history
and you could find the most amazingly
accomplished
lgbtq people
should the lgbtq people take pride
and that there were so many famous
people and geniuses that were also
in their community and the answer is no
no you shouldn't
it's just a coincidence has nothing to
do with you
stop making it about you
if somebody was really smart 200 years
before you were born you don't get any
credit for that none i give you no
credit for somebody else sucking a
300 years ago sorry
sorry that's not on you
you did nothing
nope
nothing
you get no credit for that
so ethan klein
went after jordan peterson for going
after ellen page and ellen page doctor
and
ethan klein said
this is pretty
this is
quite a public fight
he says of jordan peterson he goes
jordan you have completely lost the plot
anything that was inspiring about you is
long gone you have yourself out
to the worst among us
the worst among us
now you are nothing more than a useful
idiot to the hordes of hateful bigots
you have forsaken any semblance of
decency shame on you twitter
no shame on you jordan peterson
to which i say
the worst among us who exactly is he
referring to
as the worst among us
i believe he's referring to the
political right
is he not
is he not referring to republicans in
general
as the worst among us
because i don't think that he's saying
jordan peterson
you took sides with let's say
the violent people in the
you know january 6 protest
i don't think he's saying that it looks
like he's saying that simply being
associated with the political right
is making you associate with the worst
among us that's how i read it i mean
again you don't know
what he was thinking when he wrote it
but the way i
i interpret it
is that ordinary republicans are quote
the worst among us
because i know he's not talking about
you know
the subset of republicans who do bad
things
because that wouldn't make sense
because there's a subset
of every group
who do terrible things
so i know he's not so dumb as to say
that the entire political right
is equal to whatever the small number of
bad characters is
just as i would not say the political
left
should be defined by the high percentage
of criminals
who are democrats
because most are not
the majority are not turns out
i think
i mean i think that's true
anyway
um this is the sort of talk ethan's
that uh
causes people to get hurt
i mean
when when i predicted that if
biden got elected republicans would be
hunted this is sort of the thing i had
in mind right this is related to that
if somebody of this size audience
talking about ethan here
can say that the political right is
quote the worst among us
without being specific that he's talking
about the worst among the worst
because the the claim is not really true
is it
i have seen jordan peterson being
embraced by the political right that
part's true
but i don't remember the kkk
interviewing him do you
oh no
i i don't remember
jordan peterson associating with
somebody who was some kind of a
bigot
like or at least objectively speaking
you know so everybody gets called the
bigot today
yeah
i don't know it's funny it's interesting
to watch this little uh dustup
but you know what it feels like
it feels like projection
doesn't it
because the democrats
are all some version of amber heard it
seems like
and i feel like johnny depp is some
version of the political right
in the weirdest way right because if you
look at his career and the way he
dresses and the way he lives
you're not thinking political right when
you see any of that
but
but you know the way we process things
we put it into buckets and amber heard
seems like she's she's a democrat
because the democrats seem to do this
cluster b thing
where
they do a terrible thing and then the
way they see the world is that you're
doing the terrible thing
and so
when ethan says that jordan is
associating with the worst among us
i wonder if he's worried that he's doing
that
because the democrats have some bad
people in their
in their category too
so i wonder if he wakes up and thinks i
don't know if i'm on the side of the
good people
and then suddenly he's making a public
attack against somebody who's who is
basically him
but the left left version of him
i don't know it looks a little like
projection
you can't say that i mean i'm not
qualified to make that determination
but
am i wrong that all democrats feel like
some version of amber heard
you know it's just the way we our brains
have been
let's say primed
yeah
so i would say uh
i'm going to agree with the comment i'm
seeing on locals i don't agree with
everything that jordan peterson says
but it's always interesting
it's always provocative and i think it's
always additive in the sense that he's
not trying to hurt people he's trying to
make things better and i think he does
um
feminism is all but dead now somebody
says there's a new york times column on
saying that feminism is all but dead i
don't
don't see that
do you
what do you disagree with him about
um
i've heard him
say some religious interpretations of
things
that i didn't quite
line up with
so mostly that um and i also think that
on the trans stuff
he's probably further than i am but i'd
have to i'd have to really see exactly
what he said i'm not entirely sure
that's true
um
what
concealed carry is unconstitutional
according to the supreme
court oh client has been getting heat
from his lgbt audience after recent
comments oh yeah
my criticism is vague that's true
yeah you know in general when
uh i'm talking about notable people
who've said lots of things about lots of
things i generally walk away with either
a sense that i've agreed with everything
or there's something i disagree with but
i don't i don't often remember exactly
what i disagree with
all right um
oh it's open carry open carry was
found unconstitutional what i don't know
i guess i have to look into that
kangaroo says i'm a trans person and i
find it insufferable how the community
injects itself into every issue
yeah you know
it's been successful
because the
lgb lgbtq community has done a great job
i mean
a great job i don't know who's done a
better job of
changing how people think and and
winning acceptance from from a bad place
but you know what's weird
i i feel as if we've had trans forever
and
i i don't remember it being a big deal
when you know 20 years ago
like i remember being in a seminar in
which the um instructor was trans
and it was you know it was a
conversation and then in the class
because it's sort of just interesting
you know it was someone who
uh appeared as a woman
but we were told was born with male
parts
i don't even know if that's true but it
was you know the talk of the class and
stuff but it was more it was more the
talk of the class because it was
interesting
i don't remember anybody
having some kind of a negative thought
about it
that you know you wouldn't take the
class or they were unqualified to teach
it or anything or anything it was just
it was just an interesting factoid
and now it's become something else
i don't know if things got better did
they it got so political
when before it was just oh well there's
somebody making a choice
that i've never made
like
it seemed like it was less of a big deal
and maybe that was better
i don't know
i don't know if it was better
somebody says it got far worse
all right well now somebody so a trans
member of the audience just said that
things got worse
i guess i would take your opinion on
that over my own
all right um
you're right in the 70s and 80s people
were transitioning yeah it just i just
feel like we went from more tolerant to
less tolerant because we talked about it
more or something i don't know
with enough confidence you can use any
bathroom you want
you know i don't know why this reminded
me of this but
do all of you know that my county in
california alameda county i think we're
the last place in the united states with
masks
it's that it's actually still
like they reinstituted it recently
because it was an uptick
is there any place else in the united
states with masks are required
except where i live
there's not right in the united states
am i i'm the only place in the united
states we have to wear a mask right
so
you should see what the compliance looks
like where i live
it's become funny
the employees are almost universally
wearing the masks below their nose
almost universally
no that's too much i'll
say i'll say at least half
i say half of the employees
are
mocking the requirement by wearing it
below their nose now if you come into a
business and and the employees are
wearing it below the nose are you going
to keep your mask on
no
so the enforcement is maybe
10
i would say 90 percent of the businesses
here have just said
okay so there's a there's a new rule
that we have to wear masks
and let me let me understand this
everyone else in the country maybe the
world i don't know
everyone else in the country they don't
have to wear a mask
but in my county just in my little
county you got to wear a mask just when
you go in the store
so
since this is such a good idea
i think i'll wear my mask
like that
and like everybody here is just doing
 you masks now
it's like yeah i got a mask on because
it's a requirement oh and government
 you
i got my mask on how about you are you
wearing a mask yep
i got my mask on
uh i'm not trying as hard as i used to
to comply
but
i'm kind of going through the uh going
through the motions
so i got my mask on it's not covering my
nose or my mouth
but i like to be a good citizen so i'm
wearing my mask
so that's
that's what it looks like to go into a
store in my county
the people are so done
the people are so done
with the masks that now it's just it's
like a big joke
right
and by the way i
i don't think i've been asked to put on
the mask
anywhere that is required so far
i have worn a mask without complaint
in medical
in medical buildings
because i just don't want that fight
like i'm not going to get in a fight
with medical professionals
over a medical question
it's just not where i'm going to take
the fight
but you know the grocery store they
don't care
the gr safeway my local safeway
they've obviously been instructed that
they're not going to talk to the
customers about anything related to
masks at all
all right
if it looks like i ran out of topics
today that's because i overslept
and
there wasn't much news today anyway did
i miss anything
jewel uh yeah there's a story about
jewel and what is the story that the
biden administration wants to get rid of
vaping as well as
nicotine
all right
so is there any other um
and the other topics that i
how often are you recognized by fans and
safeway that's a good question
i don't know
because i'm recognized in a different
way than other people are recognized
so i think i do get recognized fairly
often
uh because of the live stream
so when i was
you know just doing cartooning it was
rare to be recognized i think now
probably every time i go to safeway
people recognize me probably every time
but they don't often um come up to me if
they do
they're usually conservatives
and i may have told you this before but
if i'm at the gym and somebody wants to
say something nice about my work they
whisper it now
so people will come up to me and they'll
just say
i watch you a lot i watch your live
stream every day it's great i really
like it and but they won't say it so
other people can hear it
so i'm like i'm basically like there's
their secret pleasure
you know
uh is pleasant and a persuasive name for
a city
yes it is
true story
the name of my town is pleasanton like
pleasant owen
the town next to me
is livermore
liver
more
who wants more liver nobody
and
which which one has higher property
values
pleasanton
or
liver more
pleasant
yes for now
you lived in ruby hill you were
practically my neighbor
all right um
about the pope's retirement no but i
have an update from the pope
um if i didn't mention this
um
the pope
and this is sort of an update is opposed
to war
still
so
if i didn't cover that news
now you've heard it
um
your family thinks it's weird that i
watch the sip
how weird is your family
i mean if we were to have a competition
would your would i be weirder than your
family who thinks is weird to watch this
incredible content i don't know
i don't know tell your family
and i'm talking to you directly now
this is to the family
who thinks this is weird
not weird
this
is normal everything else is weird
all right i got nothing else to say i'm
just babbling now and uh unless you have
any weird questions
i like the weird ones
oh maybe maybe we'll do that
i i will answer the weirdest question
you have
does anybody have a weird question
how's the house breaking problem i
haven't had one recently
but
my neighborhood is so bristling with
video cameras now
you i don't think you could walk one
inch in my neighborhood without three
different security cameras being on you
we are so surveilled
here at least outdoors
do i have a safety room
maybe
let me just say what i've said before
i built my house
to keep me alive
in every possible way you know so as as
a place i can exercise
you know so it's built to keep me alive
even if there's a national natural
disaster my house is going to be the one
that survives it
it's the one that won't burn down and
even if the neighborhood burned down my
house wouldn't burn down in all
likelihood because it's like fireproof
to the max
so
i i'm always ready for everything
yeah i got bad plumbing this way
ah here's a question
why do you use it feels right as opposed
to seems right does it align with your
use of sexy as a compliment well i
wouldn't um
no i wouldn't equate those two things in
any way
i like feels right because it
feels right
communicates that you're not based on
reason
seems right
sounds like you've got a reason but it
feels right you're just saying ah that's
my instinct it just feels right
why do you like living so much
i don't
why would you think that i'm not sure
living is a good deal are you
have you ever had that thought
i mean i don't know what it feels like
to not be living but i assume it's just
you know not conscious so it can't be
bad
but if but if you're having a bad day
don't you ever think why am i even doing
this
what's the whole point of this
i i think it's somewhat irrational to
want to be alive and to
reproduce
but it feels good sometimes
just want to see what happened
that's a good answer i think that
curiosity
is a way to get out of fungs
here's your tip for the day that will
help some of you a lot do you like these
this this will be my tip that guarantees
that will help some of you not many but
some percentage
will be absolutely
your life
could be changed
and that's this when you're feeling
really really bad
and you've lost all interest and maybe
there's some good or bad things that are
going to happen to you and you're just
like ah
change your frame to curiosity
if if your frame is how do you feel
maybe you don't feel so good it's a bad
frame to live in
change your frame to
what the hell is going to happen
tomorrow
like if i made this change or if i said
this thing or i invited this person to
this thing what would happen
i mean just just change your frame to
curiosity
curiosity
is one of your most base instincts right
your your uh your operating system of
your body it operates on curiosity like
if you didn't have curiosity
you probably wouldn't do much
so it's a really fundamental part of you
is curiosity so it can absorb your
it can absorb your thinking and you can
you can put your mind through that frame
pretty easily
so watch how easily this works
let me tell you how i've used it when i
find myself in a funk
and everybody does right everybody's got
their bad week or two
um i say you know
if i if i hate living anyway
why don't i just mix it up a little bit
why don't i do something that would
either embarrass me or be funny
or at least i'll feel something like
i'll just feel something
and so i say all right what would happen
if i just did this thing that is so bold
nobody would do this thing now i'm not
talking about dangerous things i'm
talking about things that could be maybe
socially embarrassing
but if they worked out they'd be great
such as
you know asking out the most attractive
person you know
now how would that usually turn out well
you probably think not so well
but what if you were just curious
what would happen
i mean what if i did
what if i did put out this invitation
what if i did throw a party
what if i did
you know uh say yes to this thing what
if i did
it completely changes your
your life
uh there was one year during my first
marriage that just to change things up i
decided that i would say yes to
everything
i didn't want to tell anybody that i was
saying yes to everything because then
they take advantage but for about a year
no matter what people would say i'd say
yes
even though i desperately didn't want to
do it
just to see how it turned out because i
have this problem i don't know if some
of you do
that if somebody gives me an amazing
idea to like hey let's
go somewhere and do something
my first response is almost always the
same
that sounds like a lot of work
or
i don't i can't even imagine why that
would be fun
or
that's like a lot of work for a little
bit of benefit you know i have all these
thoughts
but then you do it and you enjoy it and
it adds to your life and you mess with
people and you had some fun and you had
some laughs so you kind of always wish
you did it
but my first instinct is always to find
a reason not to
so i took a year where i would just say
yes
and then just make it work
and
um
uh
it was actually
pretty cool
and pretty fun
but i wouldn't do it again
do you know why
because i ended up saying yes to things
that i really wish i hadn't
they didn't work out at all and i'm not
sure you know i'm not sure that i got
enough of a benefit out of it but it was
it was an exceptional experiment
and the the experiment was how well can
you predict
what you will enjoy
and the answer is i wasn't that good at
it
there were enough surprises
that i got some humility out of that
um
michael signer wrote a book about saying
yes really
yeah the white rule water rafting was an
example example in costa rica i had a
bad experience there
learned to fly yeah i don't think so
how often do you trim your toenails
whenever i notice that i need to
does it seem to you that your
fingernails and your toenails grow at
sometimes rapid rates and sometimes
slowly
i don't know if that's an imagination
is that real
like sometimes it seems like they'll
just be one day like what the hell
happened they just turned into a
werewolf overnight
is that's real so there really is
different
phases i don't know
maybe
well i would remind you again that if
you listen to this uh live stream for
all the
new content you'll probably be
disappointed
the best way to watch this
is like you're in a conversation but
you're
thinking about other things or
exercising or cleaning the house or
something
and i'm just that friendly voice that's
your friend in your head
and
how many of you
you know that's my favorite compliment
when people say they like my voice
because you know my story three and a
half years i couldn't speak
i had a rare disorder
and for those years my affirmations was
that i scott adams will speak perfectly
now there's no such thing as speaking
perfectly but
i do this every day you know the live
stream
and i do think that there's something
about practice that makes a difference
and i do think that i've
experimented with different voice
technique
and that at this point my voice is
actually quite powerful
it has an effect
how many of you
have had a reaction
specifically to the voice quality
that i have
tell me something about that are there
those of you who like listening just
because the way i
talk so let me tell you some of the
tricks you want to hear the tricks
because it's not natural in any way like
voice production is completely
artificial
so one of the things i do
and it took me
years to do this
is learn how to add variety to my voice
so that's the first thing
so
instead of this is the way i would
normally talk and if i thought i was
getting excited i'd go up like this but
really it was just the same thing just a
little bit higher it wasn't much variety
at all and i would just talk in the same
base like this and people would stop
listening after about a second because
you can't listen to something that
sounds like this
so
the first lesson was from the movie
network
where the
on-air personality was teaching somebody
how to make something sound interesting
and the secret is that you punch words
randomly
and it's the randomly part that blows
your mind
you're like randomly
shouldn't you punch the important words
yeah
doesn't doesn't seem to matter
i mean you could but it's the variety
that's really drawing people in
so when joe biden does his whisper thing
that everybody makes fun of
it totally works
it's just that he whispers things that
aren't important
if if he
if he made his whispering light up with
his also most important points you know
that were shocking or something that
would be better but he often says
ordinary things in a whisper it's a good
technique
now i don't know if you notice
uh because i'm conscious of it now but i
try to go up
and i try to go down
and i try to give you a lot of variety
but i also give you pauses
like that
because they drive you crazy don't they
when you're expecting something and then
you get the pause
like that
it just makes you crazy but it also
makes you pay attention so i mean i
don't pause that long usually
now in terms of the actual voice
production
the trick to use is the humming happy
birthday you've heard me say this before
if you hum happy birthday
so that it produces a hum and the mask
of your face is called you know sort of
the nose mouth part
that gets your voice production out of
your throat and larnix and and lungs
because you because if you produce your
voice in the lower part of your body
let's say from here down
if that's what's doing most of the work
it will sound tight and constrained
and people won't want to listen to it
but
if you hum happy birthday and then talk
directly after it in the same
in the same production way
you get something closer to a perfect
voice
i shall demonstrate
and now the next thing i say is almost
perfectly produced because i've moved my
production up to the top of my head and
when i move it up here it sounds more
confident
more clean
more
more sonically appropriate i don't know
in some way it just sounds better
but now let's see if
see if i can take it back
so i'm gonna bring my voice production
down now it's down here so you so now
now i'm gonna be talking on my it's hard
it's hard to actually do it wrong now
i've done it right for so many years
but there is there is a
technique and
part of the technique is to not be too
low
which is counter intuitive you would
think that a male voice
would sound better if it's lower
and there's something to that i mean we
do have some preference for that it
i think it tells you there's some
testosterone there or something
but far more important than
uh
how deep your voice is
is how confident it is and how clean it
is
if your voice is both clean and
confident
then
you sound
masculine enough
uh method acting tips
yeah and the way you breathe also will
change how you talk that's a
mel gibson trick
you should breathe the way you want to
be acting so if you were playing an
actor who was afraid of something
work on how you would breathe if you
were afraid of something and then when
you talk
you'll be talking in the way that a
person is afraid would talk because
you've
you've breathed that way so it just
puts you in the moment
you think the head chest voice
description is the opposite
i think if you look into it you'll find
out that i'm right
it does sound
i realize it sounds counterintuitive
but that's actually part of the point is
that it is counterintuitive
all right
uh any more secrets from behind the
curtain
uh i'm not going to tell you any more
secrets from behind the curtain i mean i
can't think of one that fits the fits
the need
but there is a secret
that is seeping out from behind the
curtain
and
i can see it but you can't see it yet
because there's a pattern that you
haven't noticed
there's a certain pattern that's
sneaking out
so you'll see it in some news i think
i've seen it in several news items
and so far nobody has connected the dots
if they ever do
it will be the biggest story
in the whole world but i don't
think it's ever going to happen
and the beauty of it is
that if you don't know the story
there's no amount of evidence of it that
you'll be able to put together you just
couldn't put it together
let's just say that a lot of the things
that happen in the world
uh
spring from the same source or sources
and it's just not obvious but someday it
will be some day it will be
am i still good good friends with the
psychic no i haven't talked to the
psychic in years
um
uh did your spasmodic dysphonia affect
the sound of your laugh
i mean it affected all of my sounds but
i don't think it improved it necessarily
you know not everybody laughs
did you know that
do you know people who don't laugh
a lot of them you don't really notice do
you
there are lots of people who don't
ever laugh
ever it's like not a thing in the same
way that maybe i don't have musical
appreciation
i think there are lots of people maybe a
third who don't have humor appreciation
and they don't ever laugh
how is that possible i don't know
i don't know
but i can tell you for sure i do i mean
i do humor for a living
and i can tell you that a third of the
public is only pretending to have a
sense of humor they're literally
pretending they don't have one
and
i don't know why i'm the first person to
notice
i think everybody else thought well
everybody's got a sense of humor
but maybe they're not laughing at this
thing but they would laugh at some other
thing
nope
nope
there are people who actually just don't
have a sense of humor and
they do they will sometimes laugh if
somebody falls in a puddle
right but that is really really
different that's
almost not in the same category of humor
it's more like a reaction to a
thing
uh you think the same thing with music
does some people pretend to like it but
they don't hear it the same way i think
you're right about that
same with food
i have no idea what a foodie tastes
because i'm not one
when i eat food it's like oh i like this
or i don't like it
but i have a feeling that people are
foodies
just have a whole different flavor
experience than i do so
i feel like
this is a good analogy so the way i am
to food is the way other people are to
humor
if you looked at me eating it would look
like i'm enjoying my food just like
every other foodie
but i'm not
i mean i assume i'm not
your cooking would change my mind maybe
it would
what's my favorite genre of music
well it's unfair to ask at the moment
because i'm
learning to play the drums
so i'm kind of focused on anything
that's got a good drum beat so at the
moment
it's hard to answer that question so
anything with a good drum beat
especially from the 70s
i'm going to like a lot
yeah rolling stones buddy rich
i don't buddy rich wasn't
i feel like he wasn't a drummer he was
more like a
magician or something
i mean i didn't like listening to buddy
rich but it was impressive how quickly
he could hit her drum i don't know
i'm completely unimpressed by him
allegedly you know top drummer in the
world or something
but he was mostly about just being fast
i think
all right
uh we foodies have a working sense of
smell so do i
my sense of smell came back
a few weeks ago
weirdly but my allergies also went away
let me ask let me ask this again because
how many of you
and i only want you to answer if both of
these are true so if you show some
restraint for a moment
how many of you have both of these
things happen to you
number one you got vaccinated any any
number of vaccinations and number two
you did not have allergies this season
when normally you always do
am i the only one
so i don't know that there's a
correlation
but i i got
vaccinated
and that i never had
spring allergies again it's only been
one year i guess
anybody else have that experience
i'm seeing some people say yes but i
think maybe it's just a low pollen
season where i am or something maybe
it's just that i don't know
yeah all right more no's and yeses
your allergies came back
but a number of people are saying
they're having their best year but i
think is anybody having let me let me
reverse the question
is anybody having a bad year an
unusually bad year with allergies go
is anybody having
yeah i think in my case
staying away from the sulphites was the
big change for me
all right
worst okay so a lot of you are having
worse years with allergies
all right all right so there's nothing
there probably
um
do you laugh at the show family guy
yeah some of the episodes of family guy
are just ridiculously funny
uh others are a little bit phoned in
um
how do pigeons know the same song
i don't know
do you talk with gotfeld every day
no not every day
but we communicate a lot
um
have i told you lately that i love you
you have not and i've noticed that
a lot of you have not told me lately
that you love me and i'm feeling that
because i love all of you so
so
are you supposed to love me back i know
it doesn't work that way have you ever
met mike judge no but he's
my judge holds a singular distinction in
my
professional life do you know what that
is
there's something that mike judge
did
that no one else has ever done since i
became the dilbert cartoonist meaning
since i became famous do you know what
that is
he would not return a phone call
he's the only one
i've never had anybody who wouldn't
return a phone call and tell him
you know one of the benefits of being
famous
is that you can contact other famous
people or just other people
and if you say who you are they'll like
oh
i'll definitely return that call because
i get to tell a story about
i talked to a famous person
who wouldn't return a phone call to a
famous person
you would right
wouldn't you
if somebody left a message and it was
somebody you'd heard of like actually a
famous person
and they said can you please call me
back here's my phone number
you would call him back
would you not
only one time in my entire
famous life that's you know maybe 25
years or so
in my famous life only one person has
refused or for whatever reason i don't
know if he refused
but only one person didn't return a call
it was mike judge
don't know why
i had a i had a professional question i
wanted to ask him
but i never got it answered
he didn't get the message no doubt it
i think he got the message
jim davis yeah i've talked to jim davis
a number of times jim davis is a great
guy
well one of the things that people don't
understand about the creator of garfield
jim davis
is that he had a i believe his degree
was in business
and so
it's no surprise that two of the people
who had business as a background i'm i
would be the other one
did better with their cartoons than
people who did not have a business
background
surprise
it's probably not a coincidence
probably makes a difference if you know
how to you know grow a thing if you know
how to turn a business into a business i
don't think it's a coincidence
that the two people with business
training did better in their their
cartoons i think it's part of the talent
stack
will california be great again
yes
yes
when's the last time you watched porn
see now that's the kind of question
that i was looking for
why did it take so long to ask me an
embarrassing question
now i'm not going to answer it
because i think there's some kind of
questions that
uh answering it
doesn't help anything but it might hurt
something
right it can't help me but it might hurt
me
so um
well let me give you an answer the
question
in all seriousness i've never seen porn
now i know a lot of you have
and and i hear it's good and i've been
thinking about trying it
um if i could figure out where it is
it's like on the internet or something
right
but a lot of you have watched porn and
uh seem to enjoy it and so i thought to
myself well i should check it out but i
don't need it i don't need it like you
do
did anybody believe that
did that sound
sound a little bit credible at all
no okay
so that's my official answer never done
it
never done it don't need it never will
unlike the rest of you
nobody's buying this at all
and i never smoke weed that's correct
all right that's all for now
and uh
i will talk to you
tomorrow
bye youtube
