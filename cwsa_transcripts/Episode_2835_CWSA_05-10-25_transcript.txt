Good morning
everybody and happy Saturday preother's
day, Mother's Day
eve. Let's get your comments working and
then we got a show for
you. The Saturday show that you deserve.
Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization. It's called Coffee with
Scott Adams and you've never had a
better time. But if you'd like to take a
chance of taking this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with her tiny shiny human brains. All
you need is a cup or mug or a glass of
tanker gels or stain a canteen jug or
flask or vessel of any kind. Fill it
with your favorite liquid. I like
coffee. And join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
hit of the day. The thing that makes
everything better. It's called the
simultaneous sip. And it's going to
happen right
now. I see Sergio has his uh coffee
warmer now. That's the way to go if you
if you've never tried the coffee warmer.
You know, the little thing that stays
hot when you put your coffee in
it. You really
should if you're a stickler about the
taste of coffee. Yeah, maybe that's not
so good cuz Yeah, it doesn't taste the
same at the end it does the beginning.
But if you like it warm, it's a good
idea. All right, I will remind you that
it's Saturday and that means uh Owen
Gregorian will be hosting a spaces event
immediately after the
show. So if you're on the Xplatform,
just look for Owen
Gregorian or you could see me I
retweeted it this morning so you can see
it in my feed as well. The link to
um the coffee was Kadam's afterparty.
you can find it. All right, let's get
this working. There we
go. All right, I wonder if there's any
science that they could have skipped
just by asking me. Oh, here we go. Eric
Nolan is writing in Scypost that people
with lower cognitive ability are more
likely to fall for pseudo profound
 Can you believe it? Dumb
people are more likely to be dumb.
They actually study
that. If you're falling for pseudo
profound BS, meaning that the sentence
sounds good, so you think it's profound,
but it doesn't mean anything. Yeah, dumb
people. That's how that works. You did
not need to do that study, Eric.
Well, Eric's just writing about it, but
no, you did not need to do the study
that was published in applied cognitive
psychology. Just ask me next
time. All right. Is there any other
science that you could have skipped?
According to neuroscience news, the
majority of parents report that they get
sensory overload from daily daily family
chaos. All right. How many of you have
ever been a
parent? And did you need to see a study
to know that you get
uh sensory overload from the family
situation where everybody's yelling at
the same time, everybody wants
something, everything's going on,
there's a TV on, there's a dog barking.
Did you really need to study that?
It's the most universally recognized
phenomenon in all of parenting that this
stimulation sometimes fairly frequently
is just off the chart. There just too
many things happening at the same time.
Yeah, you could just uh ask me next
time.
Well, um, recently, according to the New
York Post, there was a 3D printed super
car with a starting price of $2 million
that just uh was created in its own
little 3D car printing factory. So, I
guess it cost about half a billion
dollars to build the printer. They can
do all the metal that's good enough to
build a car out of, but they bought it.
They created an electric
hypercar. Um, you know, it's got
impressive statistics, but the most
impressive thing is that most of the
parts were 3D printed on
site, including all the metal. All the
metal was 3D printed. Now, I didn't know
they were that good at 3D printing metal
that it would be up to
automotive, you know, specifications,
but it is. Now, it's not very fast and
it's not economical, but it replaces the
entire um supply chain. So, you could be
a car maker and you wouldn't need to
depend on anybody for parts, even
replacement parts. You just print them.
Now, there must be some parts of it,
like the battery that they don't print,
but it's kind of cool that you could
print your own car if you had half a
billion dollars. Price will go
down. Here's another uh cool technology,
MIT technology, if he was talking about
it. So, you've already seen probably
some
headphones that would allow you to
translate from one language to another.
So, if you haven't seen it, the tech is
really good now with AI where you can
just be talking to somebody who speaks
another language and your little earpods
or your headphones instantly translated
into your your language. But the
limitation on that was it could do one
at a time. So, it was sort of good for a
one-on-one conversation. But what if you
went to dinner with five friends who
only spoke different languages? Well,
apparently they now have a translation
device that could handle all of that and
it would identify who's talking and
translate their language to yours. So,
you can do multiple multiple languages
at the same time talking to you and it
would translate all of them. Now, if
that really works, that's kind of
impressive. That's really impressive.
I saw a uh clip that Andrew Huberman had
a guest who was a top ADHD
doctor and uh he explains ADHD um in
detail, but one of the things that
caught my interest because I have
ADHD. I don't know if I do or not.
Actually, everybody says they do. Um is
that ADHD brains are interest driven as
opposed to importance driven. So if
something interesting, it takes all
their
attention. Whereas uh nonADHD people are
just doing whatever they think is most
important to do. Does that feel like
that captures it to
you? I have this
hypothesis that's not really based on,
you know, logic or or anything really.
It's just a hunch that ADHD could be
cured with a
reframe and maybe a little bit of
practice just to make sure the reframe
sticks. Now, I don't know exactly what
reframe it would be, but I compare the
ADHD brain to my own and I say, "Why
would you why would you not be able to
do what I do?" And so, I'm just going to
throw out some ideas.
If I'm getting ready in the morning or
I'm getting ready to go
somewhere, I have two sets of thoughts
that run all the time. One is what I'm
doing. Well, actually three, three sets
of thoughts. One is what I'm doing, you
know, brushing my teeth or whatever. Two
is whatever fun thing I'm thinking about
that day. Oh, I'm going to do this or
I'm thinking about the simulation
theory. And I'm just sort of going back
and forth between brushing my teeth and
thinking about fun things. But the third
thing that's always in there is what
time it is. The number of times that I
would look at the time as I'm getting
ready to do this show. You've probably
noticed I'm usually on time. Um I
probably looked at the
time maybe 80
times. Yeah. But I wasn't, you know,
super aware of it. It's just that I have
a habit of thinking what I'm doing, some
cool thought on top of it, unless what
I'm doing is really absorbing. It's not
always
absorbing. And and then what time is it?
And then I'm just doing those three
things all the time. What am I doing?
What cool thought am I having? What time
is it? And I don't do anything but that.
Now, are you telling me that people with
ADHD could not be trained to think of
three things and cycle through them?
Really? Cuz one of the things I've
noticed about ADHD people, I've known
quite a
few, is if you made a suggestion about
what they should do
differently, they would not do it. Or
they would do it once in a way that was
clearly designed to fail. and then
they'd say they can't do it
anymore. And I don't have any problems
like that. I don't have any problems
where if it really made a big difference
in my life that I wouldn't just keep
poking at it. It's like, okay, that
didn't work. Tomorrow I'll try this.
Okay, that didn't work. Tomorrow I'll
try this. And I would just keep trying
things until something worked. But I've
never seen an ADHD person do that. Now,
is that because they can't focus on it?
It it feels like there's just a
different set of
interests and not just what's
interesting, but I think it's a lack of
feeling
that well well here's I guess this is
the provocative part. I'm usually also
thinking about what would be the impact
on other people if I'm late. Do you do
that?
When you're thinking about what time it
is and you're thinking about getting
ready, aren't you thinking about the
impact on other people, like they'll be
mad at you if you're
late? Because that's what I think when
I'm getting ready for the show. I think,
well, people will really be
disappointed. And I never really lose
that thought. So, I'm doing something
for other people, even if I'm doing it
for
myself. And I
wonder, yeah, I wonder if that's uh do
the ADHD people never think what would
be the impact on other people? They
must, but maybe they don't think about
it when they're getting ready. Anyway,
so I don't have the answers. I just have
I have more questions than answers, but
I'm I'm
relatively
positive that there's some kind of
reframe that could be just practiced a
little bit that would cure
ADHD.
Um, but I don't know what that would be.
I think it's doable, though.
According to the New York Post, half of
Gen Z job seekers
uh believe that their college degrees
have already been obsolete because of
AI.
Half what kind of what kind of majors do
they have that half of them think their
jobs are
obsolete? Well, at the same time they
think their jobs are
obsolete. I was watching Mike Row on a
Benny Johnson podcast and Mike Row was
saying that there are
482,000 open jobs in the US that nobody
wants to take those jobs. Perfectly good
jobs, but they might be, you know, dirty
jobs and they might be in a place that
you don't want to be and that sort of
thing. But at the same time that half
the jobs are being
eliminated, we've got a whole bunch of
jobs that can't get
filled. So you you probably remember a
uh nal uh post on X. I won't be able I I
hope I can paraphrase it but the idea is
that uh programmers would not be
eliminating the job of
programmers you know with AI because
they can do coding but rather a
programmer plus AI would be getting rid
of your
job and and it feels to me that if you
add AI to the
world you've created more opportunity
than you've taken
away for example
Um, if I were not doing what I do and
you know I want to use my time for
something else, I would be absolutely
learning to use AI to code in Python
uh or whatever else I need to create an
app and I would be creating apps and I
would do it every day. I would have an
app a day until one of them worked. But
I would I would think of the world in
terms of infinite opportunity.
you you know even if the app doesn't
last a year you know you might be able
to make a killing and it's you know done
in six months but uh I think people got
to reorient their brain from AI is going
to take my job to oh my god the things I
could do with AI because it's going to
be available to
everybody. Um, well, on the CNN, I saw a
really dumb conversation
uh with analogy thinkers. You know how
I've told you a million times that if
you're thinking in terms of analogies,
you're not thinking. It just feels like
thinking. So, here's a perfect
example. Um, the question was, uh, I
guess Trump had decided that he doesn't
want, uh, trans in the military.
And the conversation around the table on
CNN on at the IB Phillips show is that
what if Trump decided against having
blacks in the
military because he's already decided
trans, he doesn't want trans. Couldn't
he just decide, you know, as
commander-in-chief, he doesn't want
blacks in the military? Now, does that
make sense to you to even ask that
question? Because trans we see as a
medical
condition and there's, you know, a long
history of medical conditions being
banned in the military. Am I right? If
you weighed 300 lb, are you going to get
into the military? No. If you were
blind, are you going to get a job as a
military
pilot? No.
So, if they don't let blind people fly
jets, is that one step away from banning
black people from being in the military?
No. No. Black is not a medical
problem. It's an analogy and it's a dumb
analogy. And and the and the whole table
was there. Oh, that makes sense. That's
a good question. Yeah. What about that?
What about that? Huh? No, that's just
freaking stupid. I If the best you can
do is if something reminds you of
something
else, that's not thinking. That's just
something that reminded you of something
else. So, if the trans thing reminds you
that in the past, uh, blacks were, you
know, kept down of various parts of
civilization, that doesn't mean that
banning one of them is going to lead to
banning the other one.
Yeah, you you can't compare a medical
condition to to being
black. That's the most ridiculous thing.
So, no, I don't think there's a risk
there. Well, you all saw the news story
about the uh Newark mayor and three
Democratic members of Congress who tried
to interfere with an ICE facility and
they weren't supposed to be trespassing,
so they got
arrested. And once again, we see that
the Democrats don't have any good
ideas, but they have performance
art and they have ways to stop you from
doing
things. So, this is where I call the uh
the difference between Democrats and
Republicans, the the Yoda frame.
The Yoda frame is that Republicans
do and Democrats not do. All they do is
try to stop the
doing. And every time that Republicans
take any step in the right direction or
wrong, it doesn't matter what direction.
They they try to make any step
forward, there's like this massive
Democrat
uh attack to try to stop them. So, in
this case, the mayor and three
Democratic members of
Congress got uh
arrested. But remember that uh the
election that wasn't too long ago with
the Wisconsin
[Music]
um the Wisconsin Supreme Court seat and
all the smart people were saying,
"Uh-oh, if this is lost to the
Democrats,
uh they'll they'll have enough power in
the court if somebody brings a lawsuit
to potentially redraw the gerrymandered
um area and add some Democ Democrats to
the House and maybe take control. And
sure enough, Mark Elias, remember I tell
you that if you know what's happening,
you don't know anything. But if you know
who is doing it, well, you might know
everything. So if you don't know who
Mark Elias is, you should do a little
research on that because his name pops
up a lot. Yeah. and it's always in the
context of changing the the rules or the
laws so that they're more friendly to
Democrat uh power grabs. So, here he is.
He's filed a lawsuit with the Wisconsin
Supreme Court. the AP is reporting
exactly like exactly like we expected
and uh if and he's challenging the uh
the maps that are
gerrymandered which is an interesting
approach
because isn't everything
gerrymandered you know isn't don't we
just sort of live with the fact that the
party that's in power gets to
gerrymander the
state but apparently that's being
challenged and of course it will go to
this Wisconsin Supreme Court and almost
certainly it's going to go exactly the
way Republicans worried. Uh it will be a
Democrat making a Democrat decision for
the benefit of Democrats. That's my
guess. Meanwhile, um you're aware that
Trump has a bunch of crypto that's worth
quite a bit apparently.
Um, and Norm Eisen, which is another
name you should know. Again, if you
don't know who Norm Eisen is, you're not
really understanding the
world. He knowing him and what he does
is key to understanding all of American
politics. If you don't know that, who he
is and what he
does, you're really going to be lost.
Everything will look confusing like, why
is that happening? Why is that
happening? Anyway, he was on Jim Aosta's
podcast. Turns out they're good
buddies. And it Mike Benz is saying that
if you sort of read between the lines,
Norm Eisen was trying to get some
prosecutor to go after Trump or the
Trump family maybe too for something in
crypto. Now, is there something
specific that's illegal? Not that we
know of. But would that stop Norm Eisen
from, you know, hoping you can get a
prosecutor to look into it and find
something that's not
appropriate? It looks like that's
probably going to happen. And he points
out that 40% of Trump's net worth is in
crypto. So if you really wanted to hurt
Trump, that would be a big target.
And uh the thing that make the thing
that's the creepiest about Norm Eisen is
how happy he gets when he thinks about
screwing
Trump. You shouldn't be that happy.
Like
oh, you know what I mean? It's like, oh,
oh, we really need to Oh, oh, a little
too happy.
Anyway, that'll be another case of Trump
do and maybe Norm
Eisen stops him from doing. Um, 15,
according to NewsBacks, 15 states are
suing over Trump's move to fasttrack oil
and gas projects. So there are 15 states
who do not want their economy to grow if
it means that it's they're fast-tracking
oil and gas projects. Now this is
another example of Republicans
do, Democrats not
do. Whatever it is that the Republicans
want to do, there's going to be a
Democrat who launches a legal
challenge. How about this? Trump's going
to reopen
uh a little under 5,000 square miles of
ocean off of New England for commercial
fishing. It's something that um had been
an Obama Biden era restriction on
fishing in that area. Now, there has not
yet been a legal challenge, but do you
think there won't be? Of course there
will because Republicans do and
Democrats not do. So yeah, I think the
fact that uh Trump opened it up will
probably mean nothing in the long run
because they will the Democrats will
find some judge to block it cuz they
always
do. Postmillennials reporting on
that. Here's something scary and I would
not have expected. So apparently uh
Justice Soayer
uh went to an ABA event, you know, the
American Bar Association, all the
lawyers and said to the audience of
lawyers, quote, "Our job is to stand up
and that quote, we can't lose the
battles we are facing. We need to we
need trained and passionate and
committed lawyers to fight this fight.
What
fight? Fight this
fight? What fight is she talking
about? I can only think of
one. Did she just go into as as a
Supreme Court justice? Did she just go
into an audience of lawyers and tell
them that she's on their side and
they're fighting against Trump? cuz
that's what it sounds
like. That might be the least
appropriate thing I've ever heard from a
Supreme Court justice.
Um, it makes a mockery of the whole
system. True enough. I saw a post post
on that by Carrie Severino who was
explaining
it. Uh meanwhile over at
MSNBC, Jen Saki
uh as a show that's uh moved into the
spot that was Rachel Maddo's weekday
spot. Rachel Maddo is going back to one
day a week. Uh during Trump's first 100
days, Rachel Maddo bravely decided that
she would work a regular schedule of
five
days. So brave. Uh but she's back to one
day. So, Jen Saki goes into that spot
and apparently the the ratings
plummeted. Now, I'm not completely
surprised because Jen Saki is sort of
the poor man's Rachel
Matto. She she's Rachel
Matto except without the plastic face.
You know, Rachel Maddo's face is just
just morphs and changes as she talks.
Whereas Jen Saki looks like Jen Saki the
entire time she's talking. You Rachel
Maddo looks like she's being inhabited
by demons, but the demons are just
passing through. Have you ever noticed
that? It's like one demon after another.
It's
like and
then and
then it it's like one demon goes through
and then the other one just takes over.
But it's very entertaining. And
apparently Jen Saki doesn't have that
going for her because every minute she's
on the air, she just looks like Jen
Saki, which is a pretty good way to
look. She's she's a good-looking human
being. Anyway, uh so the Democrats
continue to talk about how they don't
have any
ideas. So the hilarious thing to me is
that the Democrats became aware that
their problem is no
ideas. And what do you think they did to
address the fact that their problem is
no ideas?
Do you think they came up with some
ideas? Nope. I don't think it even
occurred to them. They they instead
worked on the
process that would get you to some new
ideas. So that would include more
podcasts, but podcasts are not ideas.
They're places where you could imagine
somebody would have one, but apparently
nobody does. Uh there there are books
being written about Biden and his brain
and what went wrong, but that's not
really an idea. That's just a processy
criticism of things they've done before.
Uh then, as you've seen on TV, number of
the uh entities have talked about this.
Apparently, Democrats have decided to
curse more in
public. Well, like that's going to help.
And cursing is not really an
idea. They're they're just looking at
anything that Republicans did or Trump
did and they're saying, "Huh, okay.
Trump sometimes uses some, you know,
strong language. Maybe we should do
that." Like they can't even find what is
the active
ingredient. Now, Trump can make a a
naughty word work because he's the
greatest showman of all time.
If you're the world's greatest showman
and and you've got like one little
wellplaced, you know, naughty word in
your entire presentation that might be
90 minutes, that could be
genius. But if all you've decided is you
should swear more when you do public
appear
appearances, that that's not going to
help at all.
So, uh, the other thing they're doing is
the Democrats are going to protest any
common sense thing that, um, Republicans
want to do. None of these are
ideas. And I don't see anybody I think
David Hog is the last person who came up
with an idea, but his idea got shot down
because he can't be the, you know, co-
co-chair of the DNC. at the same time he
primaries other Democrats. So, so the
best the best idea or really the only
one I guess that we see coming out of
the Democrats is that they should attack
each other
more. They should spend more time
attacking other Democrats. That was
their best idea so far.
Anyway, uh I keep seeing interviews
where some prominent Democrat will be
talking about the way things are now.
And have you noticed that they talk
about the horror of the first 100 days
and uh you know, how do we get into this
place? And you know, it's just it's like
a hellscape that we're in. And I think
to myself, how many of those Democrats
are experiencing days that are much
different from the day before and last
year, too? Is it is it the trade deals
that are making people unhappy because
they'll have fewer dolls? Is that the
hellscape they're talking about? Did
their rights go away? Did they lose some
rights that I'm not aware of? Was there
something about the Maryland dad that's
making people think they live in a
hellscape because there was this one
case about this one special
situation? Is that the hell they're
talking
about trans athletes? Um, the ones born
male and playing on women's teams. If
that's banned, is that the hellscape
they're talking about? Is it the
reduction of DEI, which is, you know,
clearly just racist and illegal? Is that
the hellscape? Have you noticed that
they never give you any
examples? Now, I get that if you were a
company that's being affected by the
trade deals, that would be tough for
you. But the Democrats talk like it's
obvious and universal and everybody can
see that we're living in some kind of
hellscape for the past 100 days. What
exactly are they talking
about? I mean, to me, it looks like
we're doing okay, managing wars. We've
got a plan for trade that looks like in
all likelihood it's going to give us
better deals.
What part is the hellscape? Is there
something I'm completely aware of,
unaware of? Is it the lack of
dolls? Somebody needs to stop one of
them and say, "What is it?" I mean, even
if you're worried about Doge,
uh, the Doge thing has settled down.
Have you noticed that Elon Musk is sort
of staying out of the
news, which I think is a smart play
because Tesla stock is way
up. But even Doge doesn't look scary
anymore cuz, you know, they didn't
really cut that much in the long run and
the department heads get to make the
final decisions anyway. So, what is what
is the hell escape? I have no idea what
they're even talking about.
So, I think somehow they've sold to
their their base that they're living in
a hellscape without actually giving them
any examples of what that might
include. Well, here's some maybe
slightly good news. Um JP Morgan Chase
CEO Jamie Diamond, he visited the the
Palisades, the fire destroyed Palisades
and one of the buildings destroyed there
was uh one of the branch banks. So he's
got a direct interest and uh as of today
only 31 building permits have been
issued. They need 10,000.
They've done
31. And uh Jamie Diamond, who I believe
still I think he identifies as a
Democrat, but he's a he's a very
straight shooter, you know, which is
unusual for anybody. And so I always
enjoy just looking at his quotes and the
way he's thinking. Um, but one of the
things he said is, "I changed the name
from red tape to blue tape because it's
the Democrats who seem to want more
regulations." Now, that's coming from a
from a Democrat. Now, have you noticed
that that's actually an
idea? So, Jamie Diamond comes in and he
can give them an idea. They're starved
for ideas and he comes in, I got an
idea.
um why don't you get rid of some
regulations? And then he has another
idea because he was interviewed. His
other idea he goes, I would have this,
you know, big warehouse entity cuz he
was in a big warehouse when he was
talking and I would have all of the
people involved in approvals for permits
in the room every day so that you know
there's no delay. they can go talk to
whoever they they've got all the
resources there and basically make it a
war room where they're treating it like
it's a you know emergency crisis
situation to get the permits approved.
Now whether or not you like that idea or
not, that's an
idea. That's like a real idea. I would
totally want to see that done.
So, if the uh Democrats are being
smart, they would and they're looking
for
ideas, don't have a
podcast. Don't protest anything. Just go
ask the smartest Democrat, Jamie
Diamond, what the hell should we do? And
he will tell
you. He will tell you what your idea
should be. and then you can go do the
idea or or press for it to be done. But
it's not like they don't have anybody
who knows what an idea is. There he is.
He He's one of the most public people
you could ever have and he's got
ideas. How How about they just grab some
of those and run with
them? But they
won't. Um, would you be surprised that a
Clinton judge has uh Clinton appointing
judge has temporarily blocked Trump's
reorg reorganization plan for 20 federal
agencies? No, you would not be
surprised because Republicans do and
Democrats not do. They make sure the
Republicans can't get anything done. Is
there a reason that the judge blocked
it? doesn't matter. They could have just
shopped for some judge that was going to
do it, but they got one. I doubt there's
a reason for
it. Um, and then uh compare compare the
Democrats doing nothing to the current
FDA commissioner. So this would be the
Trump administration Marty McCary who
says quote we have this plan to remove
all nine petroleum based food dyes from
the US food
supply. That's an
idea. Are you telling me that no
Democrat could come up with that idea to
remove all the petroleum based food dyes
which you know are implicated in various
health problems? I don't know the total
science, but obviously the FDA's looked
into it. Like that's an idea. So, right
down the
line, it's Republicans have
ideas, and my guess will be that
Democrats will look to find a judge to
prevent to prevent the FDA from removing
nine petroleumbased food dyes from the
US food supply because it's the only
thing they have. That their only play is
let's get a judge to stop those
Republicans.
Well, I don't know the details of this
yet, but it looks like uh Trump's uh the
Trump administration is now accepting
South African whites, white people from
South Africa who are feeling that they
need to escape from South Africa because
of race-based persecution that would be
both violence and the taking of
property. And I'm all for it. And as
Steven Miller was explaining that this
is exactly
what you know what our system was
looking for people who are literally
racebased being discriminated for race
in the worst way you know violence and
property seizures etc. And uh so we've
opened the door to them and some people
have already I guess some of the
Africaners if that's the right word have
already showed up.
So, we'll see see how big that is. I
don't
know. Well, you remember Ed Martin was
going to be the DC prosecutor, but um
that got shot down by Senator Tillis. Uh
but I guess Trump has appointed Ed
Martin to the Department of Justice
weaponization working
group. So, he's the in the weaponization
working group according to just the
news.
Now, what do you think is the the work
product of that group? Cuz I don't know
much about it, but I like I like I like
the name of it, the the weaponization
working group. If uh if what Ed Martin
is now going to do is root out the
places that our government had been
involved in
weaponization, that feels good to me.
That'd be that's an
idea and that's a good idea. So, good
luck to
them.
Um, I saw some reporting. I I think this
would need to be confirmed, but it's the
AF Post is reporting that uh journalist
Dave Riley is reporting that a Mara Lago
insider told him that Apac, that would
be the uh Israel's supporting um
political action committee uh which has
a lot of influence on Congress, was
quote getting shut out of the Trump
administration. Huh.
Now, I'm going to tie a few strings
together here. So, the first string, and
again, I would look for a confirmation
that this is true. I I don't know for
sure that this is true, but if it's true
that Trump now has a little problem with
Apac, that would be interesting. And
then you heard the story probably that
uh one of the reasons that Mike Walsh
got
reassigned was that he was allegedly and
again this is the second thing that I
can't confirm so you know maybe the
reporting is is sketchy but uh that when
he was in the NSA Waltz was working with
Netanyahu
um sort of behind the back of Trump
because Netanyahu and Waltz may have
been more pro-war and more willing to go
to war with Iran than Trump
was. So, is it possible that
Apac supporting Israel was more pro-war
than Trump was and that he's giving them
the cold shoulder because of that? Is it
possible that Walsh was reassigned
um because he was a little too
pro-war? Is it possible?
don't
know. But
um here here's another uh
detail. Apparently Trump just announced
or um the administration announced that
Trump is no longer demanding that Saudi
Arabia recognize
Israel to get a nuclear deal with the
US. In this case, the nuclear deal would
be for domestic nuclear power for Saudi
Arabia, which I guess they
want. So that would be sort of the third
indication that Trump is telling Israel,
okay, we're in it for America and you're
in it for Israel. And when those are not
exactly the same, we're going to do
what's good for America. That's what it
feels like. Now, I'm I'm getting ahead
of myself because these are these are
stories that I'm not sure how confirmed
they are, but there are a lot of them
recently. The the fact that they're all
rolling out at about the same time means
something. Uh
similarly, Pete Hegsath apparently uh
canceled his plans to visit Israel so
that he could travel with Trump instead
to Saudi Arabia.
Is that a
disc to
Israel? I don't know.
Again, you I'm just looking at all the
breadcrumbs and it's starting to look
like the US is, you know, putting down
some kind of a marker that says we're
America. We're going to do what's good
for us and if you don't like
it, doesn't matter. I'm going to do it
anyway. So
maybe, but uh apparently Saudi wants to
get American help for uh their own
domestic nuclear program. And of course
America would like to do that because
otherwise where are they going to get
it? China or Russia? So we don't want
that.
Um, and I guess the Saudis didn't want
to reward Israel with some kind of
recognition as long as there's still
some bad stuff happening in Gaza.
So, it looks like Trump just said,
"Well, we could either wait forever for
Israel not to be messing with Gaza, or
we can say, "Okay, Israel, you do your
thing and we'll do our thing with Saudi
Arabia and we'll get whatever we can get
done done if it's good for America."
That's what it looks like.
Um, so and and then we also heard that
the the Israelis were not part of the
decision that uh Trump and the Hoodis
made to not fight with each other
because the Houthis did not agree to
stop attacking Israel. So there again,
it looks like Trump said, "All right,
you're not going to attack American
ships. Okay, we're done." And it looks
like Trump did not hold out and say,
"We're going to keep bombing you until
you don't bomb any of our
allies."
Nope. It looks like he just said, "If
you're not bombing
us, that's
good." And then Israel is going to have
to figure it out.
So, and then uh there was some
suggestion that Trump might be looking
for a a deal with Iran that would not be
to the specific liking of
Israel.
So, is any of this real? I don't know.
But does it seem to you like there are
way too many little breadcrumbs pointing
in the right
direction? I guess I mixed a metaphor
there. Do breadcrumbs ever point in the
right direction? Oh, yeah. I guess it
could be a path of breadcrumbs. Yeah.
Okay, that makes sense. So, it's
starting to look like Trump is putting
some distance between his own interests
for America and Israel's interests. Is
that good or bad? I don't know. I don't
know. I mean, it's hard to tell at this
point.
Um, so we're we're hearing the first
whispers of what the Trump tax package
will
have. You you want to be really
disappointed. Apparently, all this time
they've been talking about the tax
package and the big tax cuts and stuff.
And now there is a sort of a
draft that's going around. I guess I'll
just call it that. So, this is by no
means the final proposal, but here are
some of the things that are
missing in the current view of what the
tax policy might be. All right, the salt
deductions. Those are the deductions if
you have high state income taxes. I
don't know if those will ever be put
back in because those tend to be the
blue states, you know, California, New
York, etc. So, I don't think they want
to reward the blue states. So, I'm
thinking that won't be part of it, but
it could. Um, there's no increase in
taxes for the top incomes, although
Trump had signaled that if they wanted
to do that, he wouldn't say no. But he
didn't want to, you know, be too
aggressive backing it because he thinks
that, you know, it would cause a
political weakness.
It doesn't mention anything about
getting rid of taxes on tips and
overtime, although that that was one of
Trump's promises. Um, it doesn't include
cancelling taxes on social security,
which again was Trump promise. Um, it it
doesn't have a tax break for auto loan
interest payments, which was a Trump
promise, and it doesn't have a a
starting credit for family caregivers,
which I guess had been promised at one
point.
Um, and then uh and then apparently the
Republicans are weighing a up to a 21%
tax on university
endowments, which I also don't think is
necessarily going to happen.
So, does it even look like the
Republicans were doing anything? What
were they doing in those meetings?
If the best they could come up with is
something that doesn't seem to consider
anything that the president
wanted, how how's he going to sign
it? It just it just feels like they
didn't do any
work. Now, of course, this is a, you
know, first drafty kind of a release.
Maybe they're just testing the the
public reaction to it. You don't know
how serious it is. Please. Uh,
but it really doesn't look like they did
any
work. Like, I can't even criticize it
for being what I want or what I don't
want. It just looks like they didn't do
any work. There should be at least
something in there that makes me mad or
makes me happy. But it looks like all
they did was say, "All right, well,
let's just keep the taxes the way they
are, and we won't get we won't have the
automatic reversion to the old tax rate.
We'll just keep it the way it is and go
forward." That's called not doing any
work. So, great job,
Congress. According to Just the News,
California is looking at a annual
deficit of $10
billion, which is exactly the amount of
illegal immigrant
healthcare. So, we can't say we didn't
see it
coming. The amount of health care for
illegal immigrants is exactly the amount
that we're being robbed
of. I don't even know what to say about
that.
like that there's no comment to add to
that. It's like such a poorly managed
state. It's just even hard to hold it in
my head. Well, the good news is that the
US and Marco Rubio's team, it looks like
they were deeply involved in getting
India and Pakistan to agree to a
ceasefire. Now, I think a week ago or
so, whenever this started, I told you it
wouldn't last long and it wouldn't turn
into a nuclear war. And the reason is
India and Pakistan do not want to have a
nuclear
war. Neither side wanted a nuclear war,
but they
also maybe didn't know how to back down.
You know, they didn't want to be the
first one to back down. So, this is one
of those cases where the US could really
do something solid, which is sort of get
in there as mediators, which apparently
we did, and uh help them climb down
from, you know, the the aggression that
was happening. And it worked.
Apparently, it worked. So, now the
president's got the Hoodi thing that he
can claim as a
success. and uh India and Pakistan
ceasefire which he can claim is a
success. He still needs a lot of work to
do on Ukraine and you know Gaza is still
a problem but uh those are two nice two
nice little winds for the first uh 110
days or
whatever. Well, the uh the X platform
uh has been received orders from the
Indian government to block over 8,000
accounts in India. Now, X doesn't want
to block any accounts just because the
government told them to. So, you know,
unless it if it if it violated their own
standards, they would block them. But
they don't want to do it just because
some government asked them to. And in
many cases didn't give reasons. They
just said these 8,000 must be banned or
or the entire X platform will be banned.
So it looks like what X is going to do
is they're going to
comply but only in
India. So I think that means they're
only blocked in India but they would
still exist in other countries and
they're they're still working on it. So
it's not a it's not a settled affair.
Well, the uh this is the weekend in
which the Chinese and American
delegation is meeting in Switzerland. Um
just before I got on, there were some
unconfirmed stories that the Chinese
delegation had walked out without giving
a
reason. And then I read a few other
stories and it turns out they just broke
for lunch.
Now, that's not confirmed either, but uh
does anybody have a uh the most
up-to-date information on that? Because
I don't think the Chinese delegation was
going to walk out without giving a
reason. It It seems far more likely it
was a lunch break, doesn't
it? So, if you know anything about that,
just put it in the comments. I don't
think it I don't think the talks broke
down. They have so much they need to
talk about.
But it is a confusing situation because
um some say that Trump says he wants to
go from 145
uh% tariff to 80% but others are saying
it it's going to end up at
34%. And it's weird that they throw
those numbers around while they're
negotiating. If you were China and you
knew that they said, "Well, it could be
80, it could be 34." Would you spend
even one minute talking about 80? I
think you'd go right to 34 and try to
get that lower, too. So, it's a weird
negotiating technique. Doesn't look very
good.
Um but uh
Lutnik told Fox News that he expects
that no matter what happens, Trump's
going to keep significant reciprocal
tariffs on
China. That's where the 34% comes from.
So we'll see. We'll see where that goes.
I don't think there's going to be any,
you know, big successful announcements.
I don't think the fentinel thing is
going to get solved. I think China will
just game that system and nothing will
change there. Um, but we'll
see. Meanwhile, Newsmax is reporting
that the US is thinking about offering
Greenland a special status. Now the
special status would be based on the
model that we've used for some small
island nations like Micronia and the
Marshall Islands and
Palo which apparently have um let's
let's say uh special arrangements with
the United States without being part of
the United States. So the United States
provides various services which would
include security and maybe US mail
service and some other essential stuff.
Um but they don't have to be part of the
United
States. Um however
uh we don't think that that would work
in Greenland unless Greenland became
free from Denmark which is possible. So
it looks like a a
completely
practical it does seem practical because
we have a model in which we've done it
before with these special arrangements
with these little islands and you know
they probably have low population too
like Greenland. The only thing that's a
stopper is that Greenland is part of
Denmark. So if you wanted uh you know if
you want to make this deal first
Greenland would have to say you know we
want our independence but we'll be okay
because we'll have this special
arrangement with the United States but
we'll still be independent and we can
get out of that deal anytime we want.
We'll just say we don't want in anymore.
We're out. But the idea would be that
the United States would offer them
essentially free
services. Uh and in return uh and they
would also have no no tariffs. So they
would operate just like they're part of
the United States. They'd have security,
they'd have essential services, and
they'd have access to the United States.
and we wouldn't ask much in return
except to make sure that we could put a
military presence up there that would
protect them as well as us. So it sounds
like a pretty good idea except for the
Greenland has to be independent which is
possible they could become
independent. Well, I remind you that uh
this is the end of the show and there
will be a spaces event. That's the audio
feature that X has. So, you have to be
on X. And uh Owen Gregorian will be
hosting that just a few minutes after we
finish here. So, I like listening to
that while I'm getting myself
breakfast. And uh you can continue the
conversation on these topics or anything
else that
uh that you like. So you can look for
that link in in in my X account or Owen
Gregorian. You could just search for him
on X. You'll find
him. And I'll just say uh few words to
the local subscriers
privately and the rest of you. I'll see
you same time, same place tomorrow.
