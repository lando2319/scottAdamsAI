today is gonna be
well it's gonna be a good day
maybe not for every one of you
but statistically speaking
99.99 percent of you could have a good
day
but uh you know
some people not so much but you you're
going to be good and why well because
you were wise enough smart enough and
good looking enough
to arrive on time to watch the what
that's right the simultaneous sip i know
it's almost too good to believe
imagine your luck
i mean if the rest of your day goes as
well as this has gone so far
wow
the things you can get done today
could be a good one
there's something that you've been
thinking about doing
i'm talking to you right now
look at me look at me
i know you're doing other things you're
exercising you're taking a walk you're
doing some housework but look at me look
at me
there's something that you were planning
to do
or wanted to do
that you're hesitant about
and you're thinking to yourself i don't
even know why i don't want to do it like
i sort of have reasons
but i don't know why exactly i don't
want to do that thing i i should make
that phone call i should invite that
friend i should ask that person now and
i should i should apply for that job
do it
just do it today
do it today because i said today is a
good day to do it
you don't need a better reason
today is a good day to do it
just do it
you'll be fine
will you be embarrassed uh maybe
get a good story out of it will you
succeed i don't know
does it matter nope
nope doesn't matter it doesn't matter if
you succeed do you know what matters
that you tried
that's it that's your system
the system is
you try
so do that today
we'll get to the simultaneous sip
but i wanted to leave you that today's
the day there's a thing that you've been
putting off you know you need to do it
just do it just do it today and watch
what happens
and now
all you need to enjoy this morning to
the maximum extent is a copper margarita
glass of tankard chalice or stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous but it happens now go
oh yeah
now you feel the fortification you
needed
that little extra push to do that thing
all right i missed a comment i'm going
to look here from russia
you often argue that x isn't bad because
we already do some version of x but this
ignores the possibility yes the thing
we're already doing is also bad and
should be gotten
this little too generic mauricio i
understand your point but you need to
connect that to a specific topic and
then i can deal with it more effectively
but i understand the point
um alyssa milano was part of the uh
i guess the marches a lot of women and a
lot of men too
marched because they're worried about
their uh
so-called abortion rights
and they don't want to lose them in the
supreme court because i guess there's
some cases that are coming up that'll
challenge
roe v s rovery suede oh somebody's got
uh
very cool somebody's watching me in
a 3d world
that's very cool
um
anyway so alyssa milano was a speaker
now
you may not be on her team
you know she identifies with the left
maybe you're on the right you're saying
you're saying to yourself
i don't like that alyssa milano
but i gotta tell you she's good at what
she does
and again i like to compliment people i
disagree with i'm not saying i disagree
with her i'm just saying i'm going to
give her a compliment in this case i've
disagreed with her on other other stuff
but here's her argument
and she said this and i quote in a
speech i can't believe how a handful of
men
talking about the supreme court i can't
believe how a handful of men are
successfully taking 50 years of rights
away from women
and how our supreme court
packed with abusers
is just gonna sit by and let it all
happen
now forget about whether you agree with
her right
i i know you don't agree with her in
many cases right most of you probably
don't if you're if you're on this uh if
you're watching this you probably don't
maybe you do
but
just look at the persuasion
here's the argument that doesn't work
we have a right to abortion
does that argument move anybody we've
got a right it's our right
not really
how about even it's our bodies
better
it's better because everybody responds
to that right oh it's our bodies
but we also know that the government
does control our bodies and we like it
that way
we do
the government controls your body always
has
and we like it that way
so it isn't really ever it's never your
body you know your your choice
you don't live in that world the
government decides if you go to war
the government decides if you're free or
you're in jail
because they make the laws and if you
don't follow them they decided you're in
jail and then they put you in jail you
don't have control over your body
you want control over your body
maybe
but you don't have it not even close
right
so although although the argument can be
persuasive it doesn't make any sense
because we are we we gave away our
rights to our body
when we decided to have a government
basically if they can draft you
if they can draft you they control your
body
now i agree with you that you'd like
less of it are we all on the same page
we'd all like less of that right there's
nobody there's nobody who's arguing give
give the government more control over my
body no nobody's on that side i'm just
saying you're already there
so the argument intellectually kind of
fails but persuasively i think it does
work
it just doesn't work as well as
what alyssa milano did what elizablano
did that really works
this is the best argument against
uh the current situation so she's
arguing that it's men taking things away
from women
now do you know how the the psychology
of humans works
when they have let's say
if you were to compare these two things
which is the stronger psychological
impulse
the impulse to not lose something you
think you have
or the desire to guess something that
you want which is the stronger of the
two
not wanting to lose something you
already have
versus hey i'd like a new thing that'd
be great
yeah the the the not losing something is
the stronger one
so notice how she puts she she phrases
this in terms of
uh a bunch of men
taking things away from
women that's not bad
persuasion wise i'm not taking your
stand on abortion can everybody
understand that
you're not going to hear my opinion on
abortion
because my opinion
agrees with part of what she said
not
not the ultimate decision but the part
where she says why are men involved in
deciding what women do with their bodies
that's pretty strong it's the argument
that i use for staying out of the whole
thing if melissa alano says to me hey
scott adams
this is unlikely but if she were to say
to me
scott adams why are you even involved in
this question
i would say
good point good point why am i even
involved in this question
i i would it's much more credible
if women make the decision doesn't mean
it's right
doesn't mean it's wrong and it doesn't
take away your right to participate i
don't want to take your right to
participate
in any question
i'm just saying if you want the most
credible outcome
it would be women deciding what women do
with their bodies
even if there were lots of disagreement
on that it would be the most credible
outcome
so that's a good good attack vector i
think
i don't know if she'll be successful or
or what's going to happen to the supreme
court
um but
that's good persuasion it's good
persuasion
here's a tip for you
ignore the absolutists
this will be one of the most useful tips
you'll ever hear
ignore the absolutists what's an
absolutist that's somebody who argues
that things just are
or they are not
and there's nothing about risk or maybe
there's no there's no ambiguity there's
no you know uncertainty about data
anybody who's got an absolute point of
view
just ignore them
they're not even humans basically
they're they're just npcs they're just
programmed to walk around say yes
no
yeah that's all they got let me give you
an example
um and sorry locals there's somebody on
locals who did this and
don't mean to insult you personally
although that's probably gonna happen
um so i'm probably going to lose one
subscriber on locals today
maybe more
goes like this
i just saw a mean that says the vaccines
don't stop infections
therefore what good are they
vaccines don't stop
infections
therefore what good are they
that's an absolute
do you believe that
vaccines don't reduce any infections
because that's not the case
we know that pretty definitively
that people who are vaccinated are way
less likely to get infected they do get
infected though
so it doesn't work as a
statement of fact
that getting vaccinated protects you
from
infection but if you treat that as it
was an absolute
yeah i'm saying the meme again
i'll read you the meme
it's from uh it's a tweet from anthony
brian logan he says cdc director
richelle walensky says that the vaccine
cannot
prevent transmission
so why are all these pro-vaxxers saying
it can
huh
if the cdc director says
that the
vaccines cannot prevent infections why
take it
well that's that's the absolutist view
there's nothing you do because it's
absolute
do you
you wear your seatbelt because
the odds are better with it than without
it
does anybody think that a sea bill has
never killed anybody i'm sure it has
it's just it's not as common
so as soon as you're dealing with
somebody who says
oh
if the vaccine doesn't stop every
transmission
has no value
you can't talk to people like that
don't talk to people who talk in
absolutes there's nothing you can do
with that just walk away i'm not even
sure that they're real people
you know if we're a simulation they seem
to be the ones that
are non-player characters if you know
what i mean
keith oliverman has a
video out he's trying to get more people
vaccinated
if you don't know keith olbermann
let's just say that his entertainment
value
is extreme
he's he's not the most
rational person i've ever seen but his
entertainment value
pretty high
and uh
in his new video he's he's saying that
we
that
we should stop saying that their people
are vaccine hesitant because that's too
kind to them says keith olbermann he
says instead we should call them morons
snowflakes snowflakes and that they're
afraid they're afraid
that's why they don't get the vaccine
they're afraid they're afraid
what's wrong with that
what's wrong with it is that every
decision about the vaccine or not
vaccine is because people are afraid
that's the only reason you get it right
i mean you might not be very afraid
but let's say at least concerned
because whether you get vaccinated or
don't get vaccinated it's all based on
fear
the fear is the only thing that's making
any of it happen
he thinks one side is operating on fear
that's everybody
that's keith olbermann he's literally
afraid that other people won't give
vaccines it's all fear
there's no non-fear opinion involved in
any of this
right now you might not have much fear
but if you had zero fear you wouldn't
even be involved in the conversation
anyway the most important question about
his video and i i think twitter user
angela
pointed this out
uh what we'd like to know is whether the
spittle that keith olbermann was
producing in this rant
was it foaming
was it just straight spittle
it was a little rabid
foaming i think that's the important
question
all right well most of you probably saw
this story which is the funny story of
the day that apparently at sporting
events all over the country
a lot of
the spectators are starting a chant
what's the chance
i think you already know the chant it's
uh f joe biden
except they use the full word
and i guess there was a
nascar
uh race in alabama's
telediga speedway
and uh
the winner was a fellow named brandon
brown he was being interviewed
afterwards and the chance broke out
f joe biden
f joe biden
and the
the interviewer
and i don't i still don't know yet if
the interviewer was completely aware
of what the real chat was but the
interviewer very cleverly because it was
live tv
said look they're
they're chanting uh
go brandon
no wait what do you say it was uh let's
go brandon
so let's go brandon
now
uh that's hilarious because you know
we've all had that lonnie and uh
laurel and yani experience
so when you first hear that you think
yourself
maybe it was
maybe that is what they're saying
because i've been fooled by all these
other
uh audio illusions maybe that's what
they're saying
but
uh
i'm not i'm gonna say because i don't
know the answer yet maybe maybe somebody
here knows the answer to the question
of whether the interviewer knew exactly
what they were doing
or did the interviewer actually think
that the chant was something about the
race race car driver
um
does anybody know
i i haven't seen oh she laughed
oh the interviewer is laughing
well okay maybe that's the giveaway
but here's the part i love about the
story
what makes this spread
what makes it spread is that fox news
reports it
right
if fox news keeps reporting every time
there's a stadium that erupts in this
chant
and they do
they do report it every time does cnn
report it every time
i don't think so
how about msnbc do they report that
every time
no probably not
so what happens when fox news reports it
every time
it guarantees it's going to happen
right
is it really news
is it newsworthy that people are
chanting this well the first time
maybe even the second time and it might
be newsworthy you know if it's a some
specific kind of event
but watching fox news make this happen
and pretend that it's they're just
covering the news
no they're making the news
fox news is making this happen
and then the reporting of it it's a
great circular kind of business model
let's make something happen
and then we'll report it
and we don't even have to spend money
researching
we'll just listen to the video and say
oh there's a report
got another report there
got another article out of that
all right so uh and i'm not i'm not even
criticizing fox news i just think it's
funny i think it's hilarious that
they're doing it
um
in the slightly more serious news the
battle for taiwan has started
here's the report
so it's not unusual for china to send
aircraft into taiwan's airspace just to
sort of
keep them on notice that china says we
own you
but the number that they sent has just
skyrocketed
so china sent 20 aircraft
into taiwan's space uh i guess yesterday
and then later a bunch more so nearly 80
planes including fighter jets and
bombers
80 chinese aircraft including fighter
jets and bombers
80
in one day
violated
the taiwan airspace according to taiwan
what do you make of that
now obviously it's because of biden's
weakness does anybody disagree with that
somewhat obviously because of biden's
weakness they have to probe it
so is it smart for china to you know
probe for a weakness
yeah it is smart i mean given that their
goal is to
you know get taiwan under the control
eventually
is very smart
but
be careful what you wish for
be careful what you wish for
if all of you heard the phrase a pyrrhic
victory
p-y-r-r-h-i-a-c
how many of you have heard the phrase
a pyrrhic
victory
so this is a pretty well-informed crowd
especially
especially over on
on locals on locals every one of you say
yes
really
holy cow
oh even even on youtube
wow
i don't know if does this mean that i
have a more educated
audience than
the average i can't believe that this
would be mostly yes's
with a generic audience
can you
am i being surprised for no reason or is
this actually surprising it's almost all
yeses on two different platforms
maybe the no people aren't weighing in
but
i'll be damned
i really thought that that was going to
be closer to like 20 of you would know
what that meant all right well
surprising but also
good news
it's good news that you all know that
so
a pyrrhic victory if there's one person
who doesn't know it means that you might
win the battle but you've degraded your
army so much in winning the battle
that you're going to lose the war
because you don't have enough left after
the battle to to maintain and keep
things
and imagine if you will
china militarily taking over taiwan
let's just game this out in our heads
imagine that china militarily attacks
taiwan
what's the united states do
what do we do
well i'm sure we'd you know arrange our
assets our military assets but would we
fire at mainland china
i don't think so
i don't think that we would get into a
shooting war with china because it could
there's just no way i can you could win
and there's nothing like winning
that that would look like that
i think what we would do is just take
out china's economy
for a hundred years
i think china's economy
would suffer for a hundred years if they
take taiwan now that might be worth it
they might say you know
we we think in terms of thousands of
years so 100 years to get taiwan back
under our control yeah let's do it maybe
i mean i don't i can't get into the
minds of the chinese
leadership
but
i think that it would be impossible for
an american business to do any business
with china if they were militarily
taking over taiwan who disagrees
so just that statement
that the moment that china actually
fired on taiwan militarily
and and it was actually war from that
moment on and for the next hundred years
you couldn't be an american company
going to do business in china
and even the ones that are there would
have to pull out then they'd have to
now your iphone is
going to suffer for a long time because
they won't be able to assemble it
but
so that's the first thing that china has
to worry about it would guarantee
crashing their economy does anybody
think it wouldn't
guarantee
a crash of china's economy because the
rest of the world would just turn on
does anybody think that's wrong
disagree with me if if you
have reason
because you don't think we would just
keep doing business do you just
business as usual uh well we lost taiwan
i sure wish that hadn't happened
yeah china's economy is already fragile
but i think this is the further
guarantee that china is unsafe for
business
imagine considering doing business in
china
when you know that they send 80
warplanes into taiwan airspace
you're the ceo of some big company
and you're trying to decide whether to
move into china to do manufacturing
you can't do it
just the fact that they're
threatening at this level
means that china is a potential war zone
at least economically and then you know
if it's economically you can't really
move anything there
they won't be able to get any parts and
everything will fall apart no energy etc
so
as i've told you many times the economy
turns on one thing primarily as long as
you have enough resources there's one
thing that makes the economy run what is
it
what is the one thing that makes an
economy work
as long as you have enough resources
expectations
psychology
confidence yeah it's the mental part
china
has lost
the base requirement
for a good economy
the base requirement and there's no
exception to this
is some level of trust
you've got to have
some trust some certainty
some confidence
it's all gone
china has burned all of their business
capital
their psychological capital it's all
gone now
there's nobody who is a reasonable
person who follows you know world events
who thinks it wouldn't be too risky to
go into china and do business there
because it's way too risky now
not maybe not so much 20 years ago but
right now way too risky
and
that psychological problem is just
getting bigger
and
what is the one thing that the united
states would need
to guarantee that we
um take china's economy down without
firing a shot
which
which president would get you that
result
which president gets you
not a single shot fired
and china is just dismantled
only one person on earth probably
probably only one person on earth could
get that done
if china makes a stronger move for
taiwan
trump's your next president
i mean i don't know how you could
that's it
it's over
if china wants to make trump
you know get a second term
just just fire a real missile into
taiwan just one
and he's president
and he's going to come for you
he's coming for you
and this time
he's going to have the whole country
behind him
at least in terms of china you know
he'll be as divisive as ever in general
but when it comes to china
whole country's going to be behind him
and what happens if the generals say i
don't think you should do this economic
warfare it might turn into something bad
nope
now would it be a pyrrhic victory for
the united states
maybe
that's the risk
so that's why you need a trump
to manage what would be kind of a
delicate process
which is how do you get our economy to
still work if a china's if china's
economy is going down they're kind of
connected right
so how do you do that
let me throw out an idea
are you ready for a wild brainstorming
idea you ready
i'm going to tie a couple things
together i don't know if this is
practical this is just brainstorming so
don't be too critical
take this as what i call the bad idea
or the bad version
the bad version
just makes you maybe think of a better
version right so i'm just stimulating
your thinking process goes like this
how could we manufacture things in the
united states
cheaply enough
that we could compete with whatever was
happening in china
two ways
number one as i see over in the locals
platform where we're well educated on
this
robots
you can build with robots just as
cheaply in america as you can in china
do you know why
because a robot costs the same
if china buys a robot it costs the same
as if we buy a robot and the robot works
all night
and it makes you your stuff
so you come to you get kind of close to
the same
cost and you also eliminate the shipping
you eliminate all the time problems and
the shipping because it's made locally
now
so robots is part of it
what i'd like to see
is you know more of that but we don't
want to robotize
too quickly do we
you know you want to you don't want to
go full robot because that would wipe
out american jobs as well
yeah unions unions are going to have a
problem with it
so robots are part of the answer but
they're
oh stop getting ahead of me mike
damn you
over on youtube
mike
getting way ahead of me
all right that's where i'm going we've
got a million immigrants coming in
if we took those million immigrants and
said
you can come into the united states but
only
only
into these following zones
their manufacturing zones
and in these special manufacturing zones
where you're welcome
you know we'd like to know who you are
and uh you know
know who we're getting right we don't
want the criminals but we're going to be
we got a lot of immigrants they're not
americans and we're not going to hold
them to the same
minimum wage
you can come live here and you can even
stay in factory housing
because it's better than whatever you
had going when you left and you maybe
you can take some uh english classes
maybe you can work your way up to some
kind of a plan where you could become a
citizen or maybe your kids can become
citizens or something
so some kind of somebody says
be like slave owners
no you want to do this as humanely as
possible
and you want to give them a path
in which they solve our problem
while we solve their problem
do you know what our problem is
china
our problem is china
if we can solve china
and what it brings us is a million
immigrants who work
and produce things for
americans at low cost
and
so they solve our biggest you know
geopolitical problem
they bring youth into the country
because we need it for the long run you
got to bring lots of young people in
they bring in workers who
in within their special zones don't have
any minimum wage
but they can still live in a decent life
while they're learning english and maybe
preparing for
some more substantial job now the key
would be
that
they could do this legally
but they couldn't leave the zone
so you'd have to have some control over
that but you'd want to make it um work
well enough that people didn't want to
leave
because if they leave the zone they're
just going to get a you know a low
paying job somewhere else
so if you had a you know a good safe
area with maybe maybe even some health
care from the companies not from the
government from the companies
somebody says that's a modern plantation
compared to the alternative
right
so what you're saying is gosh you would
be building a system that sounds
like the you know the company's store
you know historically this has been a
bad model am i right
historically what i'm explaining would
have been a bad idea do we all agree
with that
that historically
what i'm suggesting would have always
been a bad idea it would have just
turned into sweatshops and
slave labor but what's different about
2021
you just put cameras everywhere
yeah you just say okay if you're a
company and you're gonna hire these
immigrants at less than a minimum wage
you have a responsibility to really be
monitored in this
and that would be different
in 2021 we could guarantee that these
companies are watched very carefully
to make sure that they don't become a
place where you know their people are
stuck forever and
you know they're they owe money it's a
ghetto
any of that stuff so the companies would
have to make sure that the living spaces
are are well maintained
that'll be inexpensive
they'd have to make sure that the
working conditions are human
and that they get paid enough
that they're not trapped there forever
you know they have some way out
somebody says here it comes to the
d-platforming
all right so i'm looking at your um
comments
and i see lots of now
to know they'll want reparations
um
sounds like dubai i doubt it because i
don't think dubai is worried too much
about the working conditions of the
immigrants
um this sounds like something that would
not take human motivation into account i
believe the opposite of that i believe
that this model um
relies on human motivation being exactly
what it is in other words the only way
to make this work
is to make it more advantageous for
immigrants to go through this process
than to avoid it
right that's the key yeah you'd have to
design the process so that the people
who are subject to say yeah i'd prefer
it it's way better than the alternative
because the alternative i don't know
what's going to happen to me but here
i've got a definite job that's better
[Laughter]
we are past that point
yeah now if you're if you think that i
think this is practical and we could you
know start this up tomorrow and stuff
not so much
right now it's not like the uyghur camp
i guess people would be able to to leave
and go home anytime they wanted they
just couldn't leave and come into the
country
all right
here's a cnn
giving you some fake news with numbers
i'm going to read you what cnn said and
see if you can tell me what's the fake
news part of this all right
here's the test cnn says quote a cdc
study published in august
suggested that people that got covered
19 in
2020
and didn't get a vaccine
were more than twice as likely to be
re-infected to get covert a second time
in
may or june
of 2021
compared with people who
were fully vaccinated so you can get
covet if you vaccinated
all right
you can get covent if you're vaccinated
everybody knows that right we're all we
all know that the vaccine doesn't
completely stop it it reduces the odds
way way down
so the odds of getting it if you're
vaccinated or way down most of you don't
know that
most of you think that the odds of
getting it is about the same if you're
vaccinated or unvaccinated
it's not even close
right did you know that how many of you
didn't know that is there anybody here
who thought
that the odds of getting it were about
the same if you're vaccinated or not
vaccinated
yeah you'll see people telling me i'm
wrong go
go research that i won't argue it here
just go research that
and watch that the other people in the
feed are telling you that you're wrong
yeah
see the the thing that makes you think
i'm wrong is a statistic that's
misleading
and this the statistic that says that in
some places
more vaccinated people are coming in
with infection
than unvaccinated right
so that's what you're thinking there are
these places that more vaccinated people
have it
than unvaccinated
that's not the statistic you should be
looking at
that's that's misleading
and here's why i'll give you the simple
explanation
once everybody is vaccinated let's say
in a town
just look at a town everybody gets
vaccinated
what percentage of the people who get
coveted are vaccinated
all of them
yeah 100 of the people who get coven
would also be vaccinated because
everybody's vaccinated so the more
vaccinations you have
you're guaranteed given that you can
still get it
you're guaranteed that most people who
get it will be vaccinated
but that doesn't change the statistic
that your odds of getting it at all are
way way lower if you're vaccinated
now maybe not in the long term in the
long term maybe we're all going to get
it right
but you'd rather be vaccinated if you do
well
maybe you don't i won't say that you'd
rather i'll say that
i'll say that uh
the scientists are telling you you'd be
better off that way
but you make your own decision
um
crawley says at crowley says you can't
know that they aren't they aren't
tracking vaccinated cases yes sir
yeah
they're not tracking everybody who got
vaccinated
but they're definitely surveying
vaccinated and unvaccinated people
that's definitely happening
they're just not counting every single
person but statistically they just do a
sample and that's all they need
all right
so
the the fake news is this
being twice as likely to get reinfected
so they've compared if you had natural
immunity you've already been affected
compared to only vaccinated but you've
never had it all right so those are the
comparisons
natural immunity
to vaccinated and the claim here on cnn
is that you're more than twice as likely
to get reinfected
if you've only been infected
as opposed to been vaccinated
is that real news or fake news
that's fake news that's true
it's fake news
that's 100 true
is that a possibility can you have fake
news that's 100 true at the same time
because this i believe the statistics
are true
but why is it fake
the way it's presented
let's say uh your risk of uh
your risk of getting a deadly disease
something besides covet god my nose
always rich itches when i'm in public
this is like it's a psychological thing
so half the time when i'm doing this
it's not because of
my allergies it's because i get this
psychological itch on my nose when i'm
in public
here's why it's fake news let's say take
the example of
your risk of
being killed by a terrorist
let's say your personal risk of being
killed by a terrorist is one in 10
billion
that's not that's that's not right let's
say
uh one in
let's say it's 1 in 100 million i don't
know what the real number is but let's
say it's 100 million that's your risk
and then you double it
you double it
is that a story
your risk of being killed by a terrorist
just doubled
it's not a story
because your risk was so low that
doubling it didn't make really any
difference at all
so
when cnn says your risk of getting
re-infected
if you've got natural immunity
how many people is that
like and how big of a difference is that
is this really a difference we have to
care about because when they report
doubled
if you if you hear that something
involving your health
has a double risk
you should act upon that immediately
right
you don't want to double your risk of
anything so immediately take action
but what if the doubling didn't make any
difference
like it still rounds to zero
then
take action and the other doesn't and
they're both true
if the risk is so small doubling doesn't
matter
so you don't take action
so they're trying to make you take
action
by reporting the doubling without
telling you what the absolute difference
is
right that's fake news
that just happens to be
completely accurate
just fake
apparently there's some big health care
shortage a health care worker shortage
that's not
directly related to covet did you know
that
this came as a surprise to me so
apparently even before the pandemic
there was this
sort of a crisis
for healthcare employees
and
at least based on the reporting it's not
clear why
we don't know exactly why
we've had nursing shortages for ages
yeah and here's what i don't understand
about it nursing is a pretty good job
isn't it
did that change
i i always thought that
these healthcare jobs were good jobs
somebody says only fans pays better
working conditions
here's my guess
i believe that there's a culture
within the medical community
for self-abuse
which turns into
systemic abuse for all health care
workers
am i wrong
no i'm not directly involved in that
world but what i observe is the hours
are just crazy
i mean lots of you work long hours i do
that myself
but i feel like the health care workers
are in a whole different level
of abuse
and i think that abuse comes from
you know having a lot of doctors in
charge who are used to the crazy hours
and if i did it you have to do it let me
tell you a conversation i had years ago
with a chef
for my restaurant so i had a restaurant
years ago
and the chef was uh just a bastard
he was just a jerk to all the other
employees just a serious serious bad bad
personality and made everybody want to
quit
so i had lunch with him and i said
why are you acting like the biggest jerk
in the world
when obviously you could just not do it
like what is motivating you
and he told me this
it was intentional
it wasn't you know baked into his
personality at birth or anything he was
intentionally being the worst person he
could be
on the job why
why
why did the the chef tell me directly
all right i'm not reading between the
lines
told me directly
why he was a jerk and a horrible person
to all the employees why
i'm looking at your comments uh
weed out the week unites the employees
to make them work harder
motivate them none of this is right by
the way uh because they're immigrants
he's racist he was black by the way so
he wasn't racist
well i mean
not in the usual way anyway
he wouldn't be asked to help them move
that's the best answer he was a jerk to
the employees so he wouldn't be asked to
help them move someday
maintaining pressure
boom somebody got it
uh not very stacked
somebody got it the answer is
that's how he learned it
he was brought up by chefs that abused
them
and then he said so that's why i do it
and then i said but you know it's not a
good idea
you don't think it's a good idea do you
you don't think it works
so if you know it doesn't work
why would you do it
and he said
because that's how we learned
and then i said again
yeah i'm hearing you i'm hearing you
about the part that that's why you
learned
but as of today
you can quite clearly see
this is a bad idea you know people are
quitting
i'm having this lunch with you
everything's going to and it's all
because of your personality now you see
that right and given that it's not your
natural personality it's a it's a put on
personality you're doing intentionally
wouldn't you consider changing that
maybe doing it differently
and he said
it's not the way i was taught
that's not the way i was taught
he didn't have any reason for it
he was just taught that way
so now let's get back to the doctors
do you think the doctors who often
become administrators or at least have a
big influence on you know the culture of
the workplace do you think a doctor who
got terribly abused when they were going
through their whatever
do you think that doctor is saying to us
you know
that those long hours were so bad for me
in so many ways and really unhealthy and
i am a health health worker and that was
unhealthy clearly lack of sleep is
unhealthy everybody understands that so
because i know i went through it and
it's bad
i will now correct this as best i can
and make sure all of my employees get
enough sleep
do you think that's happening
i'll bet not
i'll bet what's happening is hey i went
through this so you're going to go
through this
i'll bet that's the problem now it's
speculation right i'm only speculating
so you know i can easily be wrong i'm
not committed to this opinion
but it's kind of
it's kind of the only thing that not
that people wouldn't talk about
necessarily
yeah i think it's the culture
just a guess
all right um
apparently climate change
there's a big change in public opinion
according to a new poll
for the first time a majority of
americans now believe
that the us is facing consequences of a
warming world
have you felt that change
actually i thought i didn't know the
percentage until today but this is the
first time
that a majority of americans believe
climate change is real
does that feel right
did you know this is the first time a
majority thought that
now that's different than thinking it's
a problem
that you need to solve right so it's
slightly different
to say that we should solve it or what
resources you should put in to solve it
but just that it's a problem
now remember that people like uh you
know bjorn lomborg and
michael schellenberger will will teach
you
that the warming world might help more
than it hurts and we just don't know
definitely a risk because we don't know
but there's no reason to think it'll be
worse
the the
the most reasonable take is
probably is going to be better than it
was
right
uh
i don't know what that mean was supposed
to apply to but over on locals
somebody's supposed to be meme that says
dick is everywhere chemistry isn't
i'm like
i think that was relevant to the
conversation but
um
so i'm not going to tell you whether you
should believe or not believe in climate
change um
but
it's interesting that the world does now
what was it that convinced people
what changed
recently what changed
let me tell you what changed
do you remember that
i forget how we heard it but i think it
was cnn's
head
saying that they were going to push
climate change like crazy
and that they were intentionally going
to brainwash the public
into making climate change that are a
big issue
the news industry told you that directly
we're going to go persuade the public
on climate change
and then it happened
the this poll says it worked
this poll says that the news
successfully convinced
a big part of the public
to switch over into worrying what was it
that made them switch
what persuasion
got them to switch
was it
the data
did people switch sides because of the
data
was it the argument the facts
was it the facts and argument and the
logic and the science
was it greta
nope
nope
it was the anecdotes
it was all the stories in the news about
there's this place with a drought
there's this place with a record this or
record that
and they convinced you with anecdotes
what do anecdotes prove about climate
change like what does a specific
storm or a specific hurricane or a
specific drought
what does that tell you about climate
change
nothing
nothing
so you got persuaded
when they stopped using facts
and they stopped using science
you then you got persuaded not you
but the public
so uh what what is this that i've been
saying for a while maybe some of you
can confirm this have i not been saying
that whoever is doing the persuasion on
climate change isn't doing a good job
they just started doing a good job
do you know what how they
moved from doing a bad job to a good job
trump
they took trump's technique
they took the anecdote and sold it to
the public because the public buys
anecdotes
that's why they're selling you the
anecdotal
guy didn't get the vaccination and he
died
because the news has finally learned
that facts and reason don't move the
public
and they're in the job of manipulating
the public they're not in the job of
informing
and so they made that adjustment
and so you're going to see more and more
anecdote
because that persuades
science and facts
even if it's right it doesn't persuade
so watching this happen in real time
because remember you know you know the
old story of babe ruth baseball player
who famously pointed to the fence he was
going to hit the home run over and then
hit a home run over that fence you know
famous kind of thing
larry bird
if you if you watched uh sports larry
bird is one of the greatest basketball
players
and there's a famous story i was just
watching on youtube where he would he
would tell people what he was gonna do
before he did it
like crazy stuff
at one point he he told people that he
was going to do
a fade away three-pointer and land in
the opposite team's trainer's lap
let me say this again during a game
during the game
larry bird
called and told the opponents
where he was going to stand
how he was going to take the shot and
there was going to be a fade away shot
where after he shoots his body goes
backwards and then he was going to land
in the lap
of the trainer of the other team
he took the ball
went to that spot
drained a three-pointer and fell into
the trainer's lap
that actually happened
and by the way it wasn't even a unique
moment in larry bird's life you have to
watch the the highly clips of all the
larry bird greatest moments
it is unbelievable
it's amazing he would call the most the
most crazy things true story
one day he told he was they were winning
some series and he said he was going to
play at least three quarters of the next
game left-handed
left-handed
he was a right-handed player
he scored 27 points
left-handed he called it
he told the other team he was going to
play left-handed they only had to guard
one hand
he made their guarding
twice as easy
by telling them i'm not even going to
use his hand
for three quarters he scored
27 points now if you don't follow sports
that's like a lot of points
left-handed
all right
so the news did just did the same thing
they said we're going to change people's
opinions on climate change and we're
going to do it this year
they just did it
they just did it
i'm seeing some comments about
scott says investment isn't about right
and wrong
uh is apple and tesla too big to fail
what do you mean by is apple and tesla
too big to fail nothing's too big to
fail
i don't know what the question means
if you mean an economic sense no there's
nothing that's too big to fail you just
have to look at the likelihood
the likelihood is that they won't fail
no no time soon anyway
all right
um yeah sears failed
nothing lasts forever
until it does i guess
um
so
um
the climate change polls you are citing
are false that could be
that could be
i i will take that comment uh
in the spirit in which it's offered yeah
any poll you see
uh except for rasmussen
who tends to be
pretty darn good i quote them a lot
but yeah just a generic poll from some
some entity that you're not familiar
with yeah you have to be skeptical
all right i believe we have reached
the end of our productive morning
um does anybody feel better now
i told you things were going to start
looking up
have i followed the recent stories about
havana syndrome i don't know how recent
you mean
but
oh jen saki brought up the bleach oak
last week
and no one corrected her just amazing
amazing
uh no i'm not following if there's
something new new about the havana
syndrome but i assume that it's more not
finding it
oh i've seen some leaks
links
to the larry bird stuff on youtube
you sip after i leave my god
your golden age delusion
is it
let me make let me make a quick argument
for the golden age
number one
nuclear let's say war among superpowers
i think is over
because it's unwinnable and everybody
knows it so i think world wars are
probably over in the
shooting sense we'll have lots of cyber
stuff but we'll get that under control
the mrna platform
shows promise for curing all kinds of
stuff including cancer
right
so
because of the pandemic here are the
things that will change
all right
and maybe would not have changed without
the pandemic
um
commuting and working in the office
right it's one of the worst things in a
lot of people's life was having to
commute and working in a terrible office
that's gone forever in the sense that
you at least have options
you know i mean you could work for a
company that doesn't require it or a
company that does but you have an option
now way more than you ever had so i
think commuting
changes
uh if you're following the electric
bicycle market
it's way bigger than you think
meaning the the impact on society
so the quality of batteries and the
price and and the power of batteries got
to the point
where having a battery assist on your
bicycle
allows you to go 100 miles on a bicycle
pretty easily i mean it still takes some
time but it's pretty easy
and
it's going to change everything you
don't know it yet because we we haven't
organized around it but in 20 years
you're just going to be on an electric
something
and maybe even your car will be less
useful
i think there's going to be all kinds of
changes in housing i think that
the economy will be fine
and
i think that
um
ai will not kill us all i think it will
help us
now there's a risk of ai killing us all
so i mean that's a real risk we have to
manage it but i think we saw it far
enough in advance
e-bikes made in china yeah yeah i mean
if anybody wants to call me out
for buying chinese products you're on
the wrong page
all right i'm not the guy telling you
that you or i or anybody else has to
stop buying
all chinese-made products i'm not
telling you that that would be bad for
american companies too
what i'm telling you is that moving new
business there is done and that's all it
takes to to end china
um
so those are some of the things
happening i would say that most of
what's happening
is positive even if it doesn't look that
way remember the news is only going to
tell you what's bad news
so afghanistan is over the middle east
looks like you know more peace than
we've ever had because of abraham
accords
iran
weirdly isn't making a lot of noise
right now is it
but why is iran so quiet
anybody
what's happening with iran
it's too quiet right
almost like something's gonna happen
like a deal maybe
it feels like the calm before some kind
of a
agreement
newsom
scott love him
so this is a comment on youtube in all
capitals newsom scott love him
okay that's not even close to true
uh yeah israel has uh said that they
will unilaterally take care of iran
which i imagine makes iran more afraid
and not less
i've got a feeling that iran would like
a world in which the united states would
talk or israel out of attacking but
apparently that's not going to happen
because israel just said okay we're just
going to do what we need to do
that
could take care of the problem
because i'm sure that their intelligence
on iran is pretty darn good by now
um
yeah
still waiting for an e-bike stream well
i did a e-bike
yeah i guess i should do more of an
e-bike stream i should strap my phone to
the bike and take a ride for you
all right uh haitian caravans yeah we've
talked about that
there's more coming like a lot more
coming
um
all right
uh just looking at your comments the
news about the havana syndrome
uh
well let me check that while i'm here so
so many of you are asking me about the
savannah
i'm sorry havana
syndrome
so there's some new news that involves
the
biden administration
so one hour ago
looking into reports uh sensory attacks
they believe they're closer to
understanding
uh there's nothing new here is there
what's new
what is new
on this story i don't see anything new
on this story
um what's causing it
okay
yeah i think the government i don't i
don't trust the government on this but
we'll see all right let's keep an eye on
that and let's go brandon
let's go brandon
and by the way
it would be hilarious
if in places where you couldn't be
shouting
f biden
if instead you started chanting let's go
brandon and everybody knew what you
meant
it would be funny all right goodbye
youtube i'll see you tomorrow
