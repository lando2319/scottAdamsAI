all right let me see if I can
get some comments working
here oh it
works all
right this isn't going to work at
all so this morning my uh that's a
little trouble with the streaming
technology but it looks like it's
working at the moment how however it
distracted me so I started to pick up my
notes for the show and I realized I
haven't printed them so that's going to
happen let me print these
notes and if this works we're going to
have a
show hey it's
working good news how's everybody's
Saturday so far
it's kind of early but is it often I
don't even have the lights
right
M so the uh the interface R turning on
my side lights is so poorly designed
that I have to wrap the cord around the
object until the place that they put the
activation button way down on the power
cord is somewhere near the device on
brating it's just the worst
design see this is the part of the
show that the locals people see every
day in the pre-show but I couldn't get
that working this morning but it looks
like everything's good on locals at the
moment we are fully functional people
for the best show you've ever
seen good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams you've never had a better
time but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need is a CER M
Glass a tanker chel a canteen Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like
coffee en jooy me now for the unparallel
pleasure of the dopamine end of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Z
it happens now
go now we're
ready we're
ready well there's uh according to the
brighter side of news Joseph shavit is
writing is that his real name
shavit I I feel like there are some kind
of names that I just have to stop stop
and say what if it were the' 70s and he
got married to somebody and then they
decided on a hyphenated
name I I used to work with a woman named
Debbie beavers Debbie
beavers
anyway you can complete the joke on your
own I think I've given you enough
complete the joke at
home oh wait well anyway Joseph
shavit tells us us that there's new drug
that might be able to prolong life
30% how does it do that well it
according to the Mayo Clinic it's uh
something about a senolytic drug that
gets rid of the zombie stuff in your
blood and then you live longer all right
so we're going to live 30% longer
maybe good news huh but wouldn't we need
30% more food
or are we what would really happen if
you had people living 30% longer
wouldn't it be kind of the end of
civilization because it would be nothing
but super old people that weren't adding
as much as they were subtracting I feel
like it's good news and also the end of
civilization but on the other news we're
going to need a lot of energy with all
those people uh according to David dton
in nuck net I guess it's
nuket uh there's some kind of Steel
that's been made that is so good and so
strong they call it Fusion
grade so um there's a working group
working on some kind of Steel that's so
hard it would bring down the cost of a
of a uh building a nuclear reactor it
bring down the cost by a an order of
magnitude now what would happen if you
brought down the cost
by an order of magnitude and maybe maybe
even made it even more resistant pretty
good A whole bunch of things happening
in the nuclear
World um you may have heard the story
about the uh the poor residents in the
LA area got a fake emergency alert so
there were real alerts and there's a
real fire but apparently the system on
its
own no human push the button they say uh
the system because of some kind of bug
sat out on alert and scared the beesus
out of about a million people um but
then the authorities went on TV to make
sure that you knew it wasn't their fault
because that's the important part whose
fault it was and they say not only did
they not send it but their technicians
are looking into it and they don't know
what happened just sort of a weird
technical glitch but if you haven't seen
the video of the spokesperson trying to
explain it I just have to give you my
impression of it because he's got The
Interpreter so you've got The
Interpreter who's got this huge
personality and I'll just this is just
so you get the visual this is not a
racial thing it's just the visual
imagine if you will this super
charismatic semia afro uh black man
who's The Interpreter and he's killing
it I I mean assume I assume it's really
he's really translating it correctly it
looked like it um but he he's really
really impressive so he's you know doing
big pictures and his faces and he's
really he's really nailing this
impression and I Can't Take My Eyes Off
him like he's really interesting and
then then you look over to the actual
spokesperson so he's this uh little
white guy yeah we we didn't push the
button well we don't know who pushed the
button it could be some kind of
Technology thing
but but we didn't push the button and
then The
Interpreter it's the most hilarious
contrast of Charisma and non-ch Charisma
you're ever going to see in your life
wonderful anyway um a miracle has
happened according to James Woods his
home in the burndown area survived the
entire all the houses across the street
from them were burned and he was told he
was sure his is burned I I think he had
been told that but it
wasn't I'm not even sure it was damaged
by fire at L um you know obviously
there's going to be smoke and damage and
utilities will be turned off so it's not
like it's totally good luck but I don't
know what this means oh Adam corolla's
condo I think he thought that was lost
but it
wasn't um I'm eight for eight on this
tragedy
now you know I don't want it's a bad
form to say anybody's lucky or having a
good time because most of the people are
suffering and going to be suffering for
a long time I mean the the devastation
is incredible but it is nonetheless true
that there were eight homes I was
worried about because of personal
connections and or just affection so I
certainly wanted James Woods and Adam
Corolla to come out well uh they're the
ones on name others or personal contacts
family that sort of thing but there were
eight homes I was worried about and they
were all in the uh either evacuate now
or get ready to evacuate
category so far all eight have survived
and and all of them are against the odds
it's like the one building standing that
kind of thing I don't know how that
happened I'm eight for eight
now uh is that a coincidence or are are
we going to find out will we find out
that there are far more people who came
through it than than didn't well not
that didn't most of them most of them
have just pure tragedy but are there
going to be more not so bad as you
thought stories or did it just sort of
concentrate in my little world but I'll
tell
you um I'm still dedicated to making
sure the California just do all right so
I'm I'm all in on making this better
but just on a personal note
wow
um here's something I didn't know about
the Pacific Palisades that I'm just
learning this week apparently it wasn't
just a good place to
live it might have been according to
what I hear from locals maybe the best
place that anybody ever
lived I was completely unaware that
there was any place in Southern
California that I would not be too hot
to live like I I don't like the too hot
places but apparently the weather was
great cuz it was on the beach you could
leave the the the windows open all year
long uh you could walk everywhere every
store was clean and awesome the
neighbors were
wonderful uh there wasn't much traffic
in that area there wasn't much
traffic and you know just just the
amazingness of it everything worked
everybody was happy it was like paradise
apparently
um it was yeah and this is unfortunately
this is part of the story it would be
great if it wasn't but it is Pacific
Palisades was 84%
white um how many places are 84%
white I mean I I live in a relatively
you know whitish area of California
we're not 84% white at most I don't know
60% probably not that maybe 50 I'm not
really sure um could be lower could
be I don't think it's
40 but it could be around
half so that that would be the normal
California situation closer to half or
less so 84% white I didn't honestly I
didn't even know there was a place in
the United States that was 84% white
now Michael
shellenberger writes in detail I'll just
pull down a piece of it but his larger
argument is fascinating you should
follow him on X and what he points out
is that the uh this is his words the
so-called progressives finally achieved
what they supposedly warned us of but in
truth wished for the eviction of the
affluent descendants of colonizers the
incineration of their homes and the
destruction of a city that more than any
other represents our bloody history of
white supremacy and
Conquest now
um he doesn't claim shellenberger
because he's very smart and doesn't say
crazy stuff he doesn't claim that it was
some kind of big organized plot to do
bad things to white people right
nobody's saying that I'm not saying that
he's not saying that five minutes later
somebody's going to say why do you think
it was a plot against white people not
saying that not saying that don't
believe
it
however intention sometimes shows up in
your
priorities meaning it doesn't have to be
a
plan it can just seep into your
priorities and then you end up in the
same place so let me read a little more
um now this is sort of getting to uh
getting toward let's say this is getting
toward the conspiracy theory part of it
now I I want to be really clear I do not
believe there's a conspiracy a larger
conspiracy involved I do not believe it
at all
I do believe that we're going to see the
result of Dei hiring we don't know what
percent and which people it would be
unfair to say this one person is a Dei
hire and they're the problem I don't see
that I I don't I don't see the Dei and a
specific person doing a specific thing I
don't see that it could be because you
wouldn't know you see if you see people
making mistakes you don't know why you
know from our perspective you just know
they're mistakes
you could know their Dei
hires and you know they make
mistakes but Gavin Newsome isn't a Dei
hire and we think he made some mistakes
so just you know kind of chill your
enthusiasm for the anti- Dei stuff
because I'm pretty anti- Dei as you all
know but as soon as you tie it to an
individual person and an individual act
you've lost you've lost the plot you
should think of it as a system problem
not a thing that one person did that
time that's that just doesn't help
anybody because you can too easily just
slide without even intending it you can
just slide into pure racism when that's
not really the complaint about Dei I
mean it ends up being racism against
white people but the complaint is it's a
destruction of the entire system over
time anyway so Joel poock who you should
follow if you want to really know what's
happening with the uh with the fire
because he's not only a local but he is
on the scene and he's getting some
reports that I haven't seen anywhere
else so for example uh Joel poock said
this is the he's got a picture of it he
says this is the Santa inz Reservoir
above the Pacific pal Palisades I noted
on Sunday two days before the fire that
was largely empty apparently according
to the LA Times it was down for
maintenance
really it was down for
maintenance in the height of the fire
season well I'm not sure if this is the
height but the the winds made it a
dangerous
possibility
and this is amazing now not only is Joel
asking the question and the rest of you
are asking the question why was that
thing down for
maintenance and you know was that a
contributing factor was that
incompetence or necessary so so here's
one of those cases where you're going to
say to yourself ah whoever took that
down for maintenance was a Dei hire
maybe they were maybe they were but
maybe there was also a necessary reason
they took it down and there was nothing
they could do so I'm trying to do the
best I can not to jump to conclusions
that are not in evidence and it is not
yet not yet in evidence that
incompetence
caused that to be you know empty just
when they needed it don't know but you
know who else doesn't
know
um Governor news him so he's opening a
investigation into why the heck that
thing was empty and why it was down for
maintenance then and and
uh Colin rug is pointing out on X that
the water Chief makes uh 3/4 of million
dollar per year and oversaw the emptying
of that Reserve now again I want to be
really clear because this is important
because this is a real human
being and it's it's not my job to dump
on some real human being if they did the
right thing even if to me it looked like
the wrong thing because we don't know
the full context but apparently the head
of the the water Chief had had pre
previously sat on a podcast and maybe
other places um that her main
concentration was
Equity so she had a recent podcast with
Janice
konis and who was hired by Karen bass
mayor Karen bass
um who oh so that's the water Chief and
uh you're going to say well is she a is
she a Dei hire the answer is we don't
know if that's the problem but
yes yes probably but we don't know that
that's the problem all right um but
here's my take uh so she says pretty
clearly that her you know among her top
priorities was
equity
and here's my observation there's no
difference in how it would look in the
end if the if the reason we're in this
situation is a
conspiracy or even
terrorism or if it's just the result of
people having the wrong priority PR
ities because we can observe plainly
that the priorities are misplaced so
that's obvious if what you if what you
can observe
clearly would explain everything you see
you don't really need the conspiracy
theory which doesn't rule it out by the
way it's not ruled out but you don't
need it everything's explained by the
most ordinary obvious
observable uh lack of right priorities
if you have the wrong priorities the
odds of you getting a good result pretty
low pretty
low and uh I would go further and say
what I've said before that um a total
system collapse in the United States
from Dei as your priority is
predictable it's
predictable
now um I've told you before that the
human brain is not good at knowing
reality and I talk about how you can all
look at the same fact
but you can see two completely different
movies on the same screen same facts
you're looking at the same time but you
see one movie I see another movie that's
that's ordinary most ordinary thing so I
say that you can't really tell what is
reality and you can ever really know so
the best thing you can do in my opinion
is pick the reality that predicts the
best so if you have a view of the world
that accurately predicts what's going to
happen you're probably close to of the
truth or whatever truth a human brain
can get to and you all saw me for last
several years predict that Dei no matter
how well-meaning it was would cause
total system collapse and that
everything it touched would be destroyed
in roughly the order in which it first
started Dei and how much power how much
emphasis they put in it the sooner it
started and the more emphasis the more
guarant and the more that then the
sooner you'd see system collapse we
don't know yet if this is what caused
all the uh what what looks like bad
Management in this area we don't know
but it was predictable and if and if
it's not being if this problem is not
caused by it you could predict pretty
pretty clearly that eventually there
would be so whether we're seeing it
already or it's ahead of us maybe even
worse it's guaranteed it's a system
design guarantee if you design the
system that says take your Take Your Eye
Off the ball because the this
unimportant ball is the important
one everybody can predict how that turns
out a child a child could look at that
and say what you're you're going to not
look at the important thing as the most
important thing like how old would you
have to be before you knew that was
going to be the collapse of the system
10 10 year olds maybe a 10-year-old
could figure that out that's that's our
current
situation all right so the New Yorker
has a
uh
uh has a cover of Elon
Musk um being sworn in it's a comic so
it's a picture of being sworn in and and
Trump is sort of CAU out of the picture
and what they're trying to do is tell
the world
oh Elon Musk is really the one in power
and they're you trying to create this
this conflict between musk and Trump let
me ask you this why would Democrats and
this is just a Democrat propaganda
publication nobody should take seriously
the New Yorker and but why would why
would the Democrat machine try to drive
a
wedge between the most effective
operator in the world musk and the best
president in the world
Trump what would be the point of just
putting a wedge between such capable and
well-meaning people who are clearly in
it for what's good for America why would
they do
that well they they must think that it
would destroy the effectiveness of the
president and then somehow they get some
political benefit from
that this is so far away from being any
kind of a
positive thing with the country you know
I love competition I like I like when
the parties are competing for ideas and
people compete in capitalism Etc but
what is this it's just a
sabotage that if it worked would greatly
degrade the effectiveness of the
administration for your
benefit they're they're trying to
destroy the government or or really one
of the wrongest Parts about it which is
this Alliance and by the way if they
manage to take musk out don't you think
they just move to whoever is the second
best person on the team right you know
you could argue that maybe somebody else
is already the second best but or the
first
best but it doesn't even look like the
Democrats are trying to do anything but
destroy and all they have left is these
weird high school taunts it's like name
calling and you you know what let let me
put into words what that New Yorker
story is saying in different words N ner
ner uh musk and Trump sitting in a tree
k i SS i n g am I wrong it's literally a
12-year-old's
attack it's empty stupid embarrassing
unproductive incredible I mean it's it's
just so so stupid
and evil that I don't even know if I
have enough words for
it speaking of that uh uh Joe Biden was
asked some questions about Havana
syndrome this is according to Lucas
tomson on X he says that uh so aan
syndrome is where uh there's a suspicion
that a secret Sonic weapon was injuring
people in the embassies and causing some
brain damage uh and other damage I guess
but Biden asked about hav he was asked
about aan syndrome and he answered
talking about Isis and the Rampage in
New York New
Orleans okay so he was asked about
Havana
syndrome which was allegedly an attack
on some government officials but he
answered about Isis and the Rampage in
New
Orleans is it possible that the entire
explanation of what happened to Biden's
brain is he he was attacked by
a a secret Sonic microwave weapon did
the Russians cook his
brain I don't think so I'm just saying
it's funny that anyway you can connect
the Dos maybe Russia got his brain we
don't know speaking of stupid Democrat
Publications do you remember when
Fortune Magazine was like a respectable
actual
magazine and Dilbert used to be in the
cover all the time I think once a year
for a number of years Dilbert was the
main cover of Fortune it was usually
their episode about best place to work
and so this just
happened so a prankster uh pretended to
be a whistleblower and talked to Fortune
Magazine and they ran the story
completely fake saying that X was going
to the xplatform was going to remove all
timestamps from your post and start
charging $8 for anybody who signed up
that was completely made up completely
made up
um and it was a prankster who said he
was an engineer recently fired from X
now so Alex Finn is reporting on this on
X and uh he his take on it was that Elon
Musk has killed Fortune Magazine and all
traditional media which is a pretty good
title but yeah that's basically what
happened so when you watch anything that
looks like traditional media it's pretty
much because it's funny
am I wrong about that when I talk about
X I talk about amazing content it's like
wow Tucker Carlson had a guest that is
blowing my mind and you know elon's
posts are you know great and you just
it's just one amazing thing after
another on Ax great opinions you know
shellenberger poock you know the the
just really brilliant takes all day long
and then you go to the media and the New
Yorker is doing n Neer Neer and Fortune
magazines didn't fact check a
hoax it gets worse it gets worse next
story um Molly hway has a has a piece in
the Federalist about Jake Tapper and the
Russia collusion
hoax
now I I don't want to ruin it for you CU
this is one you just have to go read
Because if you don't see read the whole
piece you can miss the magic of it but
there's uh there's one little anecdote
in it or anecdote or a little story in
it where I guess Molly Hemingway was
appearing on CNN some time ago and the
Russia collusion thing came I guess was
in the early days of that and the
allegation is that I think it was Jim
skudo on CNN started to report the
truth started to report the truth and
and according to Molly Jake Tapper
grabbed him by the wrist and squeezed it
to stop him from
talking now if you want to find out what
was the truth he was saying and whether
or not that was an accurate you know
impression of what was happening you got
to read the story so just follow Molly
Hemingway tremendous uh Talent as a
writer and a Observer of politics one of
my
favorites um the Alx account on X tells
us that four years ago today Trump was
banned on most platforms four years ago
today now I never knew how many
platforms he was banned on you knew
about the big ones right but it's funny
how many people thought that banning him
was like also their job listen to this
list so these are the ones that banned
Trump four years ago Facebook or Google
Spotify well okay Spotify because they
have podcasts on there really Snapchat
Instagram Shopify
Shopify he wasn't allowed to
shop really really you could take away
somebody's right to
shop uh redid of course twitch H YouTube
of course Tik Tok huh hm Tick Tock okay
but the funniest one is
Pinterest
Pinterest he he was preventing from
making uh homemade crafts and selling
them on
Pinterest do you think Pinterest was
just trying to get on on the action hey
hey we're going to ban them from making
asay and trying to sell them on our on
our
site okay
sure so this is the beginning of me me
describing to you the greatest comeback
of all
time so four years ago January 6 banned
on all the major
platforms and then uh also of course you
know about the lawfare going after him
and we've got a sort of a partial result
on that you remember judge
Marshon uh sentenced so he did the
sentencing yesterday and this was the
Stormy Daniels case
now if you don't know what
law Trump broke in the stormmy Daniels
case there wasn't one they actually made
up a law by combining things that were
irrelevant and nobody had ever done
before until they could kind of invent a
law that he broke essentially just
invented one and managed to get their
biased jury to get a conviction then
when Trump became uh got elected
it became obvious that sentencing him
wasn't going to work like they couldn't
get away with sentencing him but they
still had to have the sentencing hearing
because that's process um and by the way
it's not just me who saying this that
there was no actual crime Jonathan turly
does a better job of it he knows what
he's talking about um so they do it and
they they basically sentence him to
nothing so they have this whole trial
they find him guilty and then when it
comes to the sent say they're like
nothing no fine no nothing now of course
you know it's politically pretty much
required that they don't put him in jail
but
um the the the amazingness of this is
that according to T Lee again and again
he's a good resource on this you should
follow him on next the uh the conviction
should be overturned on appeal now
when he says should be overturned it's
because the case was just the biggest
legal embarrassment mess of all time
that the judge was a Democrat activist
judge that was demonstrated to be true
so it was bias the charges were made up
the I think there were things that maybe
they should have been included that
weren't it was basically lawfare and
completely IL legitimate process but it
allowed Trump to to uh trash the judge
in the process as part of his statement
which was
wonderful and now Alvin brag who sort of
bet his career on getting this done and
doing a solid for the Democrats because
that'd be good for him end up ends up
embarrassing the Democrats terribly
failing terribly but more
importantly um is sort of ripped the
roof off the Democrat corrupt machine
these lawfare things in my opinion made
it really obvious that the Democrats are
not just the competing team that there's
there's a level of evil there that's you
know just not related to
uh anyway I just saw I'm sorry I just
saw an image on on locals because they
can put images in the uh in the in the
notes very
distracting it it was me on the beach
with Stormy Daniels
I don't know why we were on the beach
but we looked happy in that picture that
was an AI
picture anyway so here's what I think uh
the entire reason that the uh Democrats
are happy is that now they can say he's
technically a felon so they wanted to
give Trump the the Scarlet F you know
the Scarlet Letter that yeah maybe
you're doing some good things and maybe
people voted for you but you're a felon
and they're going to use that now I
would say that's just as effective as
ner nener you're yeah Val n
ner that's all it is it's absurdly
stupid but it's even dumber than that
because if it doesn't survive the appeal
and I don't think it possibly
could is he really a
felon have we ever seen a situation
where every smart person looking at this
you know somebody who's a lawyer says to
thems well well he's temporarily a felon
but there's a 100% chance it's going to
be reversed on appeal you know maybe the
Supreme Court who knows how long it
takes but reversed so all they got was a
reminder of the
lawfare they didn't get the Scarlet
Letter The Scarlet Letter is on Alvin
brg and judge michon and all the
Democrats who apparently allegedly
colluded for this lawfare when I see the
whole felon thing
um I don't I don't even think anything
bad about Trump I just think oh you're
reminding me of the law fair and how bad
the Democrats were got it so I don't
think the Democrats could have failed
any harder or that Trump could have won
any harder do you know what would have
been less good of a
victory less good of a victory would be
innocent of all
charges are you with me on that or
no if you're just looking at winners and
losers and we're in the context of trump
has already won the election with the
majority of votes which changes
everything right he's already won the
election and it was legitimate just had
more
votes all that
does it just make this look so corrupt
that you can't see it any other way but
pure
corruption anyway SC Scarlet Letter
turned out to be an Fu on them
um Trump is uh having this interesting
experience in his transition so instead
of people resisting him like you'd
expect or even like a lot of people said
they would according to Real Clear
Politics he said uh in his recent
appearance I haven't had anybody saying
anything bad about about me I'm not used
to it so as you know the various leaders
and bankers and people are coming in and
as essentially just asking how they can
help now I think that Trump has
accidentally created the ultimate fake
because now I talk about that all the
time the fake because it's a persuasion
term that I like to use a fake because
is giving somebody a reason that really
isn't the real reason but it frees them
to do the thing they wanted to do for
their own
reasons so the fake reason is well I
guess I guess the company is turning or
the country is turning in this direction
we're a big Corporation we serve the
entire
country so for that reason alone that
more people voted for Trump we're going
to we're going to be good with Trump and
we're going to work with him and be
productive and all that now do you think
that some of these big companies didn't
already want to work with the
administration didn't already want to
get rid of their Dei program didn't
already want to be a produ part of the
civilization instead of just being a
resistor I think most of them did I
think most of them wanted to have a good
relationship with the government it's
essential and I think that they wanted
to help the country because you know by
the time you're a CEO you're kind of
thinking i' better protect the whole
country to keep my own stuff so it's the
ultimate fake because so yes um I think
that the the CEOs didn't feel they
didn't feel they had cover for doing
what they probably wanted to do which is
the smart way to run the company but now
this gives them cover and uh here here's
the best part all right now I have to
apologize in advance before telling you
this next
thing and my apology is I I'm aware of
the fact that sometimes it feels like I
go too far and complimenting Trump's
technique because to me it's it's just
off the chart it's just next level and
I'm running out of words so I'm just
going to tell you what he just
did and I hope you can agree with me
that this isn't ordinary this is not
just a politician who had a good day
it's just part of a pattern of Next
Level thinking operating persuasion
whatever it is all right here's the
story um now according to New York Post
uh the inauguration is coming up and uh
Trump has invited some foreign leaders
that he likes that you know kind of tell
the story that he wants to tell in his
administration so for example that would
include Italy's Prime Minister Georgia
Milani um she's going to try to make it
um he he invited president
XI now keep in mind that it's not it's
not traditional to invite any foreign
leaders to the inauguration it's sort of
not the business of the foreign leaders
so Trump is first of all doing something
that hasn't been done inviting foreign
leaders but it gets better gets better
so invited president XI who won't be
coming but he's sending some high level
Emissary which I think was she's right
play that I think he I think he found
the exact middle there so nicely done
president she um he's invited
Argentina's Javier M plans to go all
right that's a win for Trump he invited
El Salvador's bu Kelli um I don't know
if he's going to come but he's been
invited and also former Brazilian
president
banaro
now here's the here's the fun part
apparently since Trump opened the
possibility that a foreign leader could
go to the inauguration which would be
the ideal place for said foreign leaders
to you know get their little word in
with the American president because it
really matters and apparently this has
caused some kind of a mad rush of
foreign leaders who are not on that list
because it's just a is his favorite ones
uh of people begging and trying to find
some way to get invited to his exclusive
Club of favorite of favorite
leaders they're they're all
scrambling to become part of Trump's
Club of favorite foreign
leaders who can do that
who can do that am I going too far am am
I giving him too much credit or the team
you know because it's not necessarily
just Trump coming up with ideas remember
he's got a really strong team at the
moment best I've ever seen and he takes
their best advice apparently this is
just so
good who he's not even in office yet and
he has four leaders begging to be in
this exclusive Club of favorite foreign
leaders it doesn't get better than that
you can't be more effective than that
this is like things that people don't
even think of when they think of being
effective this is so next level it's
crazy Golden Age here it
comes once the fire is out
maybe
um now one of the big problems I've been
posting on and got quite a few million
views on it is how tremendously
difficult it's going to be for the uh LA
area to dig its way out of this fire
problem the the homeowners are going to
be looking at an insane amount of
complication and approvals and steps and
things to get anything
done I predict that given the current
system it would take 5 to 10 years for
any one person to rebuild 5 to 10 years
so if you've got
kids and living there was you know
because a great place for kids maybe
that's out of your reach now because if
it were two years then you say well yeah
let's do it if it's 5 to 10 which is
what it looks
like what do you do so an enormous
problem but um I'm going to read you a
take by a ex-user called doctor in
sensitive jerk who you should follow on
X doctor doctor with a Dr insensitive
jerk separated by lowercase lower
underscore and here's what he says I'll
just read his words he goes uh this time
it feels like those building rules might
be
loosened yeah which I agree I I think
even the most incompetent government
might look to loosen some rules under
this situation but why he says whether
it's one homeowner or 2,000 the moral
question is the same should they have to
wait years for government
permission right whether it's one person
or lots of them should they wait years
for a government position he says this
time it feels like maybe they won't and
the reason is important really there's a
reason Okay the reason is not moral or
even
practical it isn't it is bargaining
power now the homeowners have it because
of their sheer number
oh yes before individually they did
not you're right individual homeowner
trying to get any of these rules changed
no way but this many homeowners who are
were high functioning homeowners these
are not your normal homeowners the these
are people with money and resources and
talent and there's a lot of them so yes
um but here here's the shot at the end
from Dr incens of jerk he says if you
feel that too meaning that the sheer
number of them will make a difference to
the government it means in your heart
you believe the government is not your
ally the government is at best your
rival and more likely your enemy if the
government were on our side our
bargaining power would not
matter dropping my mic
and we're done that was my mic drop in
case you're
listening that's right if the government
were on our side we wouldn't need
massive bargaining power to get ordinary
things that people want ordinary
things that's it that that's the frame
you need to get into the frame is the
government's your enemy as soon as you
believe that they're your friend you're
not going to understand anything you see
nothing will make sense and I think the
government in California or at least
Southern California in my view just
looking from the outside appears to be
in it for money and power influence and
absolutely my
enemy my
enemy um let let's ask
anybody wait 3 years and see what any of
the victims of the fire tell you do you
think your government in California is
your friend or your enemy what do you
think they're going to say after the
experience that they're about to go
through and I'd love to say that some of
the rules will get relaxed I'm not even
sure that will happen I'm not even sure
this is enough bargaining power because
if the government is completely captured
which it looks to be why would they
change if if they still have the power
to do whatever they want no matter how
many people are complaining
why would they change just because a lot
of people are complaining wouldn't be
enough do you think there's enough to to
turn
California uh red you know get a
republican
Governor well here's the problem name
that prominent um
Republican who's already got a good name
and some experience and if they ran
you'd say to yourself whoa okay that's
serious there there's a republican who
really really can make a difference
there's a Reagan you there's a trump
you know there's a
disantis who is it who in
California because I I've been trying to
think like who would I even trust who
who would have the the stones to get it
done Larry Elder I love everything about
Larry Elder I don't know if he could get
uh I don't think he could get elected
because he's tried before James
Woods I don't know I don't know he may
be a little bit of
a you know I think he's branded himself
out of that because he seems like you
know more of a pundit cernovich would be
my first
choice I I see in the comments Mike
cernovich but you know he'd have to deal
with a lot of he'd be an easy target for
critics so you don't want to somebody
who's too easy mik I don't know if mro
is a republican but he has that would be
be interesting Adam Cora I can't imagine
he'd want to take that job there you go
Michael shellenberger would Michael
shellenberger have the the right
tools to be a governor of
California I'm going to give you an
unambiguous answer yes yes now I don't
know if his uh public profile is
sufficient to you know to be that
charismatic person but here's one thing
he has he used to be a
Democrat used to be a Democrat which
also means he fully understands all of
their arguments and
techniques and he got I I don't want to
say he got red pilled because that sort
of puts puts my thoughts into another
person so I'm not going to say that but
he is very clearly in the common sense
Camp if you look at any way he you know
any way he dissects any issue it's
always brilliant it's always complete it
always shows that he understands both
sides I've never seen anything like it
so if you if you wanted to move from
complete politics and Dei and you know
just nothing but the drama of politics
and the corruption and all that if you
want to
get an operator who has a track record
of really making a difference in this
world I I believe that nuclear energy is
only you know having a Resurgence
because of one person I think it was
Michael shellenberger and probably the
most important thing that's going to
happen in the country because if we
don't have energy we're we're just in
trouble so I I see people saying Rick
grenell but does he live here Devon
Nunes oh that's
interesting Devon Nunes I don't think he
has an
interest so all right well we'll put
Devon Nunes in the short list okay so
I'd say shellberg
Deon Nunes you're saying Rick grenell I
don't know that he lives in California
but if he does if he does he's on my
short
list all right so I think really
California is a you know doesn't have
the the reaganesque character I can't
think of one but we might might have
enough enough to get it past the
Democrat
goalkeepers all right uh meanwhile as
you know meta is ending Dei
uh Zuckerberg is trans he's got quite a
change of heart in a good way um but
here are the things they're doing at
meta they're taking the tampons out of
the men's
restroom uh lucky pomber says he has
some story about that about the origin
of the tampons in the restaurant that's
a funny story that he's going to tell us
soon I believe
um Soo no longer will have Dei teams and
they're going to end their supply
Supplier Diversity effort you know
making sure their suppliers are diverse
um and they're going to end the
practice of uh requiring that diverse
candidates be considered for jobs H
they'll focus on Merit sounds
good um and all de Dei representation
goals will be
eliminated um
now Zuckerberg also was on Joe Rogan and
in my mind he answered the mystery of
Zuckerberg because all of you were
saying hey is he just like a a weasel
who knows that the wind change so he's
just going to change with the wind is is
he just trying to make money because you
know Trump's in charge so he knows that
Trump might come after him well all of
those are true he wants to make money
doesn't want the government to be his
enemy he'd rather befriend Trump than
have them on the other team obviously
the these are just obvious things that
every CEO would want so I take them off
the table
because they're in the category of
obviously everybody wants that but like
you it doesn't seem to explain it of
course he wants what every CEO wants but
you don't see every CEO doing such a a
radical change in what looks like
personality I mean it looks like a
change in personality driving a change
in business doesn't it so you say to
yourself is that fake like is it a fake
change in personality just so we can get
the CEO benefits of of you know working
with the government productively I don't
know but then he explained this on Joe
Rogan and in my
mind I'm done with the mystery this
explains everything it was fascinating
he said that I think he said he had
three sisters and then he had three
daughters and a wife and so he lived in
a completely what he called uh neutered
world where it wasn't male and female
there was no male he just lived in a
female
bubble then apparently the way he
escaped his bubble and this is his
telling it's his own telling that when
he got involved in MMA um martial arts
and started hanging out with more he
didn't use the word but manly
men he rediscovered the value of male
aggression because he was literally
doing practice fighting and he or real
fighting in a in a recreational Bo um
and that is sort of activated some long
covered up or unexpressed part of him
that was male so his telling of his own
transformation is that he didn't know
how to be a
man now those are my words but you know
listen to yourself and see if that
doesn't sound like a good
summary he didn't know
how to be a man
again that's that's my interpretation
but the way he says it that's what it
sounds like and that he rediscovered
that through interaction with other
men now once he saw both sides and he
saw you know the male part the female
part then he was in a position to choose
which one made more sense both for him
and for the
company and he chose Common Sense
there's nothing about what he's changing
to
that is beyond just common sense so he'd
been in the female world where there was
sort of feelings based preference once
he was exposed to the male world where
what matters is if you win the fight
what matters is if you win the fight and
also what matters if you win the fight
but there's a third thing that matters
did you win the
fight the female world is not about
winning the fight it's about feeling
good making sure other people feel good
and you can't you can't run a world that
way you kind of need both you can't be
heartless but you also can't lose the
fight and I think there was some part of
him who said I think I'm losing the
fight to get the feelings right now
again this is my interpretation it's
it's always sketchy when you're trying
to interpretate interpret somebody
else's thoughts but he explained it
masterfully so I would recommend you
watch The Joe Rogan episode about
that he also said and maybe this is the
bigger story that uh the the censorship
that he was receiving you know the
censorship pressure from the Biden
Administration was apparently
outrageous apparently there were
Administration people he said who were
calling and literally yelling at
Facebook staff to censor something that
he knew to be true
imagine that so this is coming directly
from the most authoritative Source at
meta and he's telling
you specifically people yelled at their
staff like they were the government's
little hey you little
you better do what I say and they
threatened them they threatened
them the government told them to censor
true information
that was valuable very valuable in my
opinion about I think it was about
pandemic stuff and and threatened
them now imagine
you're you're uh I'm going to take this
a little bit further imagine that you
grew up in a female environment and then
suddenly the government's like yelling
at your people and threatening you and
taking away freedom of speech basically
but you've awakened in this male world
of MMA fighting and suddenly you say you
know what what matters is I beat these
people what it doesn't matter that I
make them happy and that we all feel
good it matters that I beat them and
when Trump
won he said here's how I beat him I just
I just go along with common sense you
know you don't want your government
censoring your free speech you've got a
you've got a leader of Common Sense and
Free Speech now in office of course you
pair with them why because winning is
really
important also winning is really
important and the third thing winning is
very
important very
important uh there's a fake story I'm
going to call it fake it's based on real
facts the real facts are that Amazon is
declared that it's going to get rid of
its outdated Dei
programs um
but they're going to sort of fold that
function if you will into the ordinary
operation of the company so there won't
be a Dei you know
Department they'll they'll just have
people doing hiring like they always did
without that hanging over them and then
they said
this I'm just going to read it this is
this is from Amazon this is from Amazon
so they say they're getting rid of Dei
and so your thought is wow finally
everybody will be treated the same
wouldn't that be great and then they
said in their statement and I
quote we also believe that inequitable
treatment of anyone including black
people lgbtq plus people Asians women
and others is unacceptable
is anybody left
out is there is there anybody left out
of
that the reason that Dei is unpopular is
that it's racist against white people
specifically white men now also there
are probably you know I I'm sure there's
an impact on let's say Asian men and
Asian women maybe I don't know but the
main problem the main problem
is that it's racist against white men
and when they get rid of it they say
well we're going to make sure we're good
to everybody but white men unless I'm in
the category of
other
so Amazon gets no
credit no credit this is a zero you you
don't get any credit for getting rid of
your Dei that's a way to save money all
they're doing is returning to the 1980s
where the hiring manager knows damn well
that if they don't get enough diversity
it's going to bite them in the ass later
nothing changed nothing and here's the
good
news the smart uh the smart people in
the conservative side they didn't buy it
they didn't buy it because here's an
updated list of the companies I think
Robbie Starbuck has
this uh updated list of the companies
that did get rid of Dei in a way that
looks like it's serious the Amazon one
is a nothing but here's here the
companies and they don't put Amazon on
the list so it's an extensive list to
show victory in flipping companies away
from Dei does not include
Amazon that's correct Robbie starbu uh
nailing every good point on this whole
topic so these are the ones that seem to
be serious about getting rid of Dei meta
McDonald's Walmart Boeing um Molson K is
low is for Jack Daniels Harley-Davidson
John Deer tractor supply Toyota Nissan
caterpillar Inc Stanley Black and&
Decker DeWalt tools Indian Motorcycle
Craftsman Polaris I recommend every one
of those companies if you're thinking of
buying a product and one of these
companies makes it give them your
business because I think they're taking
seriously their shift away from di
Amazon of course you're going to have to
give Amazon your business because you
can't avoid it yeah I can't but no
credit you get no credit for what you've
done that that's just the 1980s where
all the managers discriminate just like
they discriminated against me back in my
banking days yeah all right here's
here's me causing a lot of trouble
online but I'm going to tell you not
everybody will know this if they don't
follow me on my live streams I'm causing
trouble for a productive reason if you
look at it from the outside you just
going to see me being an all
right and some of you already think that
on this topic it's the topic of Mel
Gibson being on Joe Rogan and saying
that he had three friends cured of
cancer by Ivon and Fen benzol two over
the not over the counter
but two drugs that are already exist and
don't have major side effects used used
properly they don't and here's what I'm
doing I'm debunking that and I'm pushing
hard saying that there is no real
example of ever happening that there's
no confirmed there's not one you will
never see Mel Gibson's three friends
sitting with her doctor saying yes the
only thing we did is use these drugs and
it cured my cancer that was otherwise
incurable so I'm saying that doesn't
exist now somebody said are you saying
mil Gibson is a liar no no no no no no
no no I'm not saying M Gibson is liar I
believe his friends told him this and I
believe lots of people are saying it and
people say to me but Scott Scott it's so
well demonstrated but here's what
happens if you go down one level now
here's what I'm trying to
achieve I would love this to be real it
might be it might be uh at least for
maybe some sorts of cancers and some
kind of situations maybe in combination
with other treatments so there might be
something here and if there is I want to
move this faster so I'm going to become
the the foil I'm going to be I've I've
taken the role of the bad guy in the
story for productive reasons I need them
to fight me I want the people who claim
this is real to absolutely destroy me I
want I want them to dog pile on top of
me until I can't breathe then we'll find
out if it's
real for some reason all of these claims
of which there are numerous very many
claims none of them seem to be able to
come public with their doctor and say
here here are my lab tests
before I didn't do anything else or
maybe I did in conjunction with
something we know doesn't work
completely and now I have complete
remission just show me one just one
because there are many many assumed
cases so how could it be I mean how
could it possibly be there's so many
people would say I personally and then
they do they say I personally got better
on this my friend got better I know
three people there are doctors who say I
know a dozen how is it
possible well I'll tell you I'll give
you I'll give you so so there's if you
study persuasion it's really obvious how
it's all possible if you
don't it looks like it couldn't possibly
be fake if so many people have had the
exact same
experience number one this is one of
those stories where a lot of people have
heard about the same guy and but they've
heard it from different people so if a
different person tells you I know
somebody who got better you think well
that's 10 stories about so it must be
true what you'll find out is all 10 of
them are talking about the one person
who has never been tested to see if he's
cancer free so that's the first thing if
you can tell me the name of the guy and
I won't name him because I don't want to
do that but if you say here's the name
of the guy who took these drugs icin
andoran bendol and he got clear
if you know the name of the guy you're
all talking about the same guy there's
basically one case that's unconfirmed
that everybody thinks happened and and
you hear somebody talking about somebody
talking about somebody knows somebody it
sounds like a bunch of guys that's
exactly what happened to me in a project
I was working on in my corporate days I
was told to build a laboratory for all
the customers wanted to test their
things before they bought them and I
said how many people want to do that and
everybody I talk to all the managers all
the managers said it's just a lot I mean
all the time we're just getting pestered
everybody wants to test it but we don't
have a way to do it I put together a $10
million plan to build a lab but I kept
looking for the people who were asking
for it because I wanted to confirm it
turned out it was one person once one
person once talked to one manager once
and said I wish I had a lab to test this
turns out you didn't really need the lab
found a way to you know make make the
right decision anyway so there was one
person who didn't actually need it and
that person talked to another person hey
what could we do about a lab for this
person that person talked to another
person everybody's asking for a lab that
person talked to the vice president my
God it's like like I I got to do
something everybody's asking for this
laboratory it was one person who didn't
need
it and I investigated myself and
confirmed that was true there was not
one person that wanted that $10 million
now that's actually
ordinary it might be happening here
here's what else is
wrong why could it be that so many
people have had a miracle cure of cancer
and yet they're not willing to come
public because if they came public and
they could show their work you know show
their lab
tests they would be the people who cured
cancer because even though they're not
the drug they would be the person who
say look the medical community is you
know trying to sell you these expensive
treatments I want to show you that I got
better with this and then maybe there'll
be another one and maybe another one and
maybe another one do you know how many
there are so far apparently there are a
lot of people who've been cured
of cancer who don't want to tell you
about it does that sound real they don't
want to tell you about it do you know if
I took a an over-the-counter or just
some ordinary prescribed drug and it
cured my cancer you would never
hear the end of it because I would not
let millions of people die of cancer
unnecessarily if I knew it
worked not one not one person wants to
come public nobody it it's it's working
all over I mean I mean just Mel Gibson
alone knows three people but they don't
want to come forward they don't want to
talk to us the only one I've seen come
forward is seems to be getting paid by
the doctor who's selling the treatment I
don't know that but the let's say the
context suggests that the person's
getting paid to support this
story it
suggests how about uh so here are the
stories that I've heard personally so
people say no I know a guy who who had
U uh he had uh prostate cancer that had
metastasized
now that's incurable it's incurable and
he reports to his friend who talks to me
and says look my friend has it it's
incurable he took these drugs and his uh
it's confirmed that his uh cancer spots
in his bones
shrunk now that sounds pretty pretty
good right if it's an incurable disease
the Tor shrunk after he took the the
drug well that seems pretty darn
impressive right and if it shrunk it
well it probably could keep shrinking it
right and maybe completely go
away here's what almost certainly really
happened people who have metastatic
prostate cancer typically No Matter What
treatments they're doing or not doing
there's going to be some point where
they're in pain it's because the tumors
in their bones have reached a certain
size the standard ordinary almost
Universal treatment is to use radiation
on them because it can shrink the
tumor it can't cure your cancer it can
shrink the
tumor whoever it is who had tumors that
were big in his bones and then they were
being measured and then they later
shrunk go back to that person and ask
him if they also were doing radiation
which we already know 100% of the time
reduces the size of the tumor but it
doesn't cure you so you eventually die
from
it so so so so let me let me put it in
in a visual way all right so if you
can't see this on on Spotify or audio
but I'm uh I'm going to make a big
circle with my hands this this big old
circle is what the oncologist
understands about uh cancer because it's
their specialty so what they know is
this big ball if you get diagnosed with
a cancer you're going to become kind of
an expert on your cancer
and you're going to learn a lot not
nearly as much as the doctor knows like
you're you know a let's say you're the
size of a bowling ball compared to a
beach ball like that's how much you know
but it's a lot then you talk to your
friend so you got a bowling ball now
that is not as big as the beach ball
that the doctor knows but you know a lot
you've got a bowling ball siiz knowledge
then you talk to your
friend when when you've talked to your
friend how much does the friend know the
friend is Mel Gibson how much does he
know pingpong ball the friend knows a
pingpong ball worth of knowledge about
the topic and specifically about the
specific patient so you're listening to
the pingpong ball
guy if you think that this that these
treatments are working talk to an
oncologist and ask him how many himmer
her ask them how many of their patients
are on icin and Fen bendol do you know
what the answer will be a bunch pretty
much every one of them because they've
all heard these stories every single
person who's in this situation has heard
that these things might work doesn't
have much of a downside of course
they're going to try them and they're
going to tell their doctor yeah I'm on
this blah blah blah so if you talk to
your uh oncologist will your oncologist
tell you that yeah you know I've seen
some miracle cures I got to say you know
you might as well try it I've seen good
results no you're not to find any
oncologist who says it do you know why
because they've never seen it
work there's no oncologist who's seeing
patients like currently seeing patients
who's ever seen it work they've never
seen it cure an incurable
cancer never or they' tell you so if you
know anybody who has cancer and they
have an oncologist of course they will
ask them to ask their oncologist if
they've ever seen even in an anecdotal
case where it cured or even fixed
anybody's cancer the answer will be no
but Mel Gibson if you talk to Mel Gibson
he's seing it all over the place because
he's not the beach ball and he's not the
bowling ball he's the pingpong ball do
you think that Mel Gibson could have
asked the question that I asked which is
was he also on radiation therapy which
nearly 100% of people in his situation
would be do you think he knew to ask
that question no because when I dig down
usually they have some other therapy
going which could actually even cure the
cancer this one is uncurable but it
might have been the curable
one so
um so what else we got uh oh also I
talked to one person who didn't want to
be
public somebody cured their cancer an
incurable one an incurable totally clear
didn't want to go public but was willing
to chat with me sort of you know as long
as long as it wasn't public do you
believe
that again do you believe there's
somebody who cured cancer and knows the
cure for cancer and it's just an
inexpensive little pill that anybody
could get and he's not going to tell you
he's not willing to go on CNN and say
hey I better bring my doctor and let
everybody
know look for the pattern now you want
to you want to know the kill
shot here's the kill shot
sh let's just calculate the odds of this
all right here's the odds Ivon oh oh and
here's the other thing people would send
me link after link saying Scott you
idiot you're not doing the homework
don't you know that there are multiple
clinical trials showing the icin
specifically and I think also Finn Ben
that both of those do work against
cancer and they send me the
link what do I know about the link
before I read it
it does not prove that any of those have
an effect on cancer so I open it up uh
in the laboratory in a Petry dish cancel
next one in a laboratory in a Petri dish
cancel in a laboratory in a do you know
what kills cancer in the
laboratory piss you could piss on the
 cancer in the laboratory and
it's going to kill I don't know if
that's true but it's funny everything
kills cancer in the laboratory it
doesn't have any predictive value none
none so people are hearing Mel Gibson's
friends and all these hundreds maybe
dozens maybe hundreds of people and and
plus the clinical trials because they
don't know that clinical trials just
means in the
laboratory I fell for one here's what I
fell for when I started looking into it
I was told that it worked in
animals that they done it in the petri
dish you know again that's not exactly
what's happening but they in the lab but
it also worked in animals on
cancer so I said to myself whoa that's
way better than a lab if it worked in
animals you're getting a little bit
closer to something that has at least a
5% chance of working because it's about
a 5% chance that if it works in animals
it works in humans how many of you knew
that it's only 5% but still you know if
it's a cure for cancer you're going to
look into that 5% pretty
hard so it turns out that once I made
that claim to somebody who had done a
little more homework than I did she said
what animal
trials and I said the ones I heard
about there are no animal trials that
worked what there's no such thing as an
animal trial that made that cured cancer
with the animals and I said to myself
but why would people say
it and certainly I've never seen any
evidence that it's ever worked in an
animal trial I can't rule it
out but I believed it you know why I
believed it heard it from multiple
sources if you by the way if you can
find the link where it cured cancel in
cured cancer in an animal I would love
to see it because if I'm wrong that'd be
great um so here but here's the ultimate
tell what are the odds that it it let's
just pick itin but the argument works
for Fen benzol as well uh what are the
odds that in the lab or maybe even an
animal tests that you just give them
this drug and nothing else and it just
kills the cancer but here's what
happened the claim is that if you only
do those things it might not work in
other words if you don't do any other
treatment you just take the two
drugs that it's not enough
uh but what really does work is if
you're doing the treatments that we know
work at least a little bit at the same
time wait a minute what are the odds
that the reason they were interested in
it is that it directly kills cancer
which is you know one set of mechanisms
but that when they tested it by
miraculous luck even though it didn't
work in humans as they hoped here's how
lucky that is it did work if you did the
other things that
work but that hasn't been tested in a
big clinical trial it's just people
anecdotally saying huh I gave you chemo
I gave you radiation I gave you hormone
therapy all things that work in some
contexts but not every context and uh I
also gave you these pills and and one of
you got
better that's
nothing that's nothing because those
other treatments have highly variable
outcomes sometimes they work well
sometimes not so well you can't tell
what was the effect of the pill on top
of
it so so again I remind you I'm not here
to tell you that these don't work
because I don't know I do not know if
they work or they don't I can tell you
that if they work the who
were not going
public are almost
criminal because if if I ever find
anything that can that cures cancer
you're going to hear about
it and you're going to hear about it so
let's ask Mel Gibson if he would try to
cure cancer in the world by asking his
friends to talk to me and bring their
doctor and I want their friends with
their medical tests and their doctors to
tell me that they think this worked if
they can do that this would be amazing I
want it to work just to be clear I'm
anti-cancer
I'm I'm Pro cure and if either ivin or
Fen benzol are part of the Cure I am all
for it I'm so for it so again I remind
you I'm I'm playing the the bad guy
because if I don't do this you're never
going to find out so I'm going to push
this to destruction right I'm going to
push it to destruction I'm probably
going to get killed and already you can
see online do you know what the most
common response to me online is
somebody that believed the hoaxes about
me and the vaccine and so they say well
let's tell everybody in the world that
you got everything wrong about the
pandemic when in fact my actual opinions
got everything right uh so they're going
after me they're they're trashing my
reputation online for trying to fix this
and I know that but I'm not going to
stop because getting trashed online is
just my normal normal day you get used
to it after a while so no I'm going to
push this and we're going to find out if
it works or if there's even any evidence
that it works or even any evidence that
would be sufficient to say you know we
should fund a clinical trial because
we're seeing you know can't prove it but
we do have some cases that can't be
explained any other way just one give me
just one person with their doctor and
maybe some tests that shows it's real
just one Mel Gibson that's for you
anyway um there's a CN editor I guess uh
he's throwing jig Tapper under the bus
in this lawsuit there's a a billion
dollar defamation suit uh the Washington
Free Beacon is writing about this
Jessica
con costescu
and so apparently the problem is that
Jake Tapper accused the Navy veteran of
uh being some kind of black mark
I don't know that he was an illegal
profiteer in some kind of Black Market
thing now the uh the editor who wrote
the the text for the
story um or edit it he didn't write it
he edited the written portion of the
report he testified that it it wasn't
his intention described the person as a
black market and he says quote the text
I approved did not include the phrase
Black Market
the banner you know the thing that runs
at the bottom of the show and Jake
tapper's lead in did that in other
words the
editor did not do anything that would
have been you know something that could
get sued for it apparently was Jake
Tapper at least that would be the
telling of the we don't know I mean you
have to listen to all the sides it
wouldn't be fair to judge this before
all the evidence is out so um I'm going
to pull back a little on that because
Jake Tapper may have a per good defense
and if you haven't heard it it wouldn't
be fair to assume that this one guy has
all the truth and Tapper has none
but but I will tell you that
uh what happens if if there's a billion
dollar
judgments can CNN even stay in
business anyway uh meanwhile black rock
is created some kind of climate group
they were part of w um and this is
reported by Ross Kerber and
Reuters and the reason they're pulling
out of this
environmental climate group is uh quote
this is from Black Rock quote however
our membership in some of these
organizations have caused confusion
regarding black rocks practices and
subjected us to Legal inquiries from
various public
officials so basically they're saying
that they're getting out of these
climate initiatives because there's too
much pressure from the world and the
governments good that that might be just
the right amount of productive pressure
so that again looks like the Trump
effect the Trump
effect meanwhile speaking of treatments
for cancer according to new Atlas
Michael Irving there's a steam blast
treatment for prostate cancer now this
would be non-metastatic kind the more
ordinary kind it's the kind that is
curable but prostate cancer is curable
with some combination of chemo and
hormone therapy and radiation and those
are really big side effects like really
big um so this is they they send a
little micro needle into your uh your
prostate and they blast steam just steam
apparently the steam does a good job of
killing the cancer cells while leaving
the other cells intact which is really
everything you want is that's everything
you want you want to leave the other
cells intact and uh they're doing a
trial which suggests that they've tested
enough probably on animals that they
know it
works that would be
amazing it's like one of the biggest
problem for older men if that worked the
theme
thing that would be such a GameChanger
for so many lives doesn't help for the
people who have metastatic version that
would be different all right ladies and
gentlemen
I really really didn't want to swear
today but I'm doing it in the service of
attracting
attention not for my hits I don't know
do you really think I do things for
clicks does everybody think I do that I
mean if you're in the game of monetizing
your content I guess you're always doing
things for clicks but I I'm certainly
not thinking of it that way when I hit a
topic hard I'm thinking this is useful
all right um are you guys give me uh
give me some
feedback are you okay with me pushing
harder in the cymon thing because
because the goal is to find out what's
true especially if it works I'd really
like to know
that all right so I'll keep pushing on
that because I think it's
useful it's going to be a lot of heat
I'm going to get a lot of heat thank you
Paul I I always like it when I see the
the people whose uh opinions I
appreciate the most or agreeing all
right good I guess I explained it well
enough that I made the sale I see one no
no no no so the worry would be the
concern would be that some people would
not use it and maybe it would work that
that would be the concern right I have
the same concern but here's the math you
should
do the few people and this is this is a
real risk the few people who uh hear me
poo poo
it maybe it it's within the realm of
possibility that I'll kill them let me
say it again if there's a treatment and
somebody hears from me they shouldn't
try it or that it's not proven I'm not
saying they should actually I'm saying
they should try it let let me be clear
somebody asked me you know if you were
in stage
four and you didn't have any alternative
would you try it yes yes I would so own
be clear if you've got a friend I should
have said that actually if you've got a
friend that you think might get talked
out of it I would try it what what the
downside is a little bit I mean you
could have some side effects a little
bit but yeah I would try it because the
downside is
low um the reason I'm pushing is that if
it
works you maybe I talked to a few people
out of it that could have helped but
we're going to be much faster in getting
to does it help yes or no much much
faster so I'm going to I'm going to take
the hit and U I'm gonna borrow a page
from Elon Musk one one of the most
impressive things I think that Elon Musk
does is he says stuff like well if I
build this
car probably some number of people are
going to die in the car because you know
happens with every car if I build this
rocket ship well probably some people
are going to die going to space but we
kind of need to do
it so he he instead of just doing what
you know isn't really good for the world
which is saying well if one spider could
die I won't do it he just says
somebody's got to make the hard choices
this is a hard choice I am fully aware
that if this works and if I talk
somebody out of it they could
die I'm doing this will knowingly
completely
knowingly because
this is how you get to more more people
saved or more people not distracted by
the wrong solution I
suppose all right so that's the purpose
anyway I'm going to talk to the uh good
folks on locals privately in 30 seconds
everybody else I'll see you tomorrow
thanks for joining and uh locals
streaming is working perfectly so I'm
glad that got uh that glitch got
fixed
