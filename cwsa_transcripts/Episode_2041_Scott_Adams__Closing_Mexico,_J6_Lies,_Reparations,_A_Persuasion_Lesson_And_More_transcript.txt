do do
good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization wow it's good to be alive
isn't it seems like we're in the middle
of all this swirling chaos of Badness
but maybe that's just our perception
maybe things are going great let's talk
about that but first we need to prepare
our minds
uh if you have something a home that
will prepare your mind better than
coffee well go nuts but uh for the rest
of us all you need is a cup of under a
glass of tanker jealous of Stein a
canteen Joker flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here today the
thing that makes everything better it's
called this simultaneous sip it's famous
around the world and maybe a little bit
more famous this week
and it happens now go
oh yeah that's good favorite
foreign
well let's talk about all the things
there's some funny things and some other
things I heard it's International
women's day
is that right
today or is it like a month or something
all right well we'll talk about that
so I saw a tweet from John quakes
you said that as of December 2021 at
least according to One Source China is
building more nuclear capacity
that's already planned then the entire
world put together
and apparently the USA is like this
little Little Dot
how in the world can the United States
compete in the future
with inferior energy sources
I'm not positive that what I'm going to
say is 100 true
but I'll bet it is you know I have had
to bat I'll bet it's true has any
country ever lost a war
when they had the most abundant energy
sources
in modern times
in modern times the one with the most
energy sources wins everything right
I think so and I would think that
nuclear would be a big part of
of making you a safe country here's the
thing the United States maybe everybody
does wrong but maybe maybe China does it
right actually because they have more of
a comprehensive view of uh War
you know I've heard I'm no China expert
but I've heard you know that China has
the concept of Total War that you know
the economy is War uh influences or all
that stuff is war
but in the United States because the way
we like to lump things and Report things
you know literally the news has somebody
who covers the military stuff
and then the different person covers the
economy am I right the way our news is
organized is that the economy is
separate from military
it just it's easier to talk about it
and although it's easier to talk about
it it also gives you a completely
misleading idea
of what defense is
military defense's economy
military defense is energy
because energy is basically your economy
you know it that's an oversimplification
you could call it hyperbole
I've been known to use it
but uh nobody would disagree who knows
anything about the world that the that
the economy is basically your military
you know I mean it's almost a one-to-one
correspondence and that energy is pretty
much your economy
so energy is your Homeland Security
you have and that's the thing that Trump
got right
right
Trump was the one who said you got to
get rid of that pipeline from Russia to
Germany because that's a military
problem essentially he is the first one
I remember framing it correctly I I
might be wrong
um
she said I was I was listening to uh
Russell Brand
talk about the fact that blowing up the
nordstream pipeline was more about
economics than any kind of you know
military security
to which I said Russell Brand you can't
separate those things
now it his point that there might be a
not might his point that some people
would have a purely Financial reason for
it
for sure I mean that's completely right
some some people in the larger drama
would have a purely financial interest
surely those people exist in in power
too
but as soon as you say that you're doing
it for one reason
you've really lost
you've sort of lost the bigger picture
the bigger picture is that taking Europe
away from dependence
on energy from you know a potential
adversary
was the smartest security thing you can
do even if it's really expensive in the
long run you've got to get your energy
under control and not under your not
under your uh adversaries control that's
just the dumbest thing you could ever do
so
I just want to add that frame I guess
that would be called a reframe
so instead of thinking that the military
and the economy are two separate
questions they're always the same and
then the third thing is that energy
equals economy they end up basically
being a proxy for the other
well
let's uh challenge your IQs here uh
uh let's see if you can get the answer
before I ask the question go
people on the there you go that is the
correct answer very good very good this
is the only audience that can answer a
question accurately
accurately
before the question is asked am I right
have you ever seen any audience that can
get the answer before the question is
asked
and here was the question
according to Rasmussen what was the
congress's perform or approval
let's say in December they have an
update but as a oh you're right 25 25
that's right so Congress had a 25
approval in December but uh rasmussen's
update is it's up to 28 percent
28 that's uh
that's roughly
that's roughly 25.
so a quarter of the country
thinks that uh Congress is killing it
wow I love Congress
I like what they're doing now
do you ever wonder how that conversation
goes
yeah the conversations we're most used
to are smart people talking to each
other
because you see them on TV you see the
pundits arguing but in the real world
the 25 of the public the voting public
this is voting public
ly voters
just make it a little worse this isn't
the General Public
this is the elite part of the public
that votes
and the the 25 of them think Congress is
is uh they're really putting up some
good numbers
do you wonder how that conversation goes
it's like well uh
I feel that goes like this
You Know Carl
I've been noticing that Congress has
really been killing it lately
yeah
was that so Eric
um you know like what would be an
example of that
well uh
there was that time they approved the
budget
did they approve the budget
I don't know
but other things a lot of other things
they did they're pretty darn good
yeah a lot of other things a lot of
other things
pretty darn good
I feel like it went like that
like like there wasn't a lot of depth of
the conversation
see what I'm saying not a lot of depth
there were not layers what I'm saying is
there were not layers upon layers of
complexity
probably not
all right well that's good
approval Congress is up
I am enjoying watching CNN try to give
something embarrassing out of the the
personal not personal but the uh the
communications within Fox news about
Dominion during the aftermath of the
election
and there are lots of emails that you
could consider maybe embarrassing
I'm not even sure that's the right word
because they're being sort of presented
as embarrassing
but when I read them I'm having the
opposite conclusion
like they're trying to say look you know
they they knew that uh they knew the
coverage was wrong and that they knew
that the election was rigged but they
said otherwise and then they show the
email and I read it and it says
I don't say that I see them I see them
wanting to serve Their audience
to give their audience the news that the
audience is most interested in as
citizens of the United States
is that nothing
is it nothing that there's an enormous
audience that has an intense interest
and a specific story
that's not nothing
now even no matter what your personal
feelings were as long as you were
talking about the facts you know and
opinions around facts
I think it's perfectly appropriate to
give the the audience the news they
crave the most they're the country the
audience is the country you have half of
it or a third of it or something
so like how is that embarrassing but
they they try to make it there's the
newest one
um
apparently uh Tucker Carlson was
reported in some email to somebody else
or something
that he
you would be basically glad that Trump
was out of the scene because these
sacred reporting on them and they he
quote passionately hates Trump
he passionately hates them now keep in
mind that the context was immediately
right in the right in the middle of
trump complaining about the election
which sort of put Fox News in a bad
situation
um now here's here's the thing is that
embarrassing
is it embarrassing that uh you know
maybe the most
you know a prominent Fox News opinion
person uh let me just finish the reframe
here
's my reframe
somehow I didn't know that
I didn't know that
I watched Tucker Carlson during that
entire period And I did not know
that he had a bias against Trump like a
personal bias
and I guess Tucker went on to say that
he hadn't accomplished much
now how is that an insult
how is that embarrassing
in what world is it embarrassing that
his audience couldn't even tell and I
couldn't tell I didn't see a bias I I
thought he reported Trump right down the
middle
you know as his opinion
you know matched up with the facts
I I feel like that was almost a
compliment
the fact that the audience couldn't tell
that he had a a very serious bias
uh how do you how do you do better than
that like what's the level above that
I mean to me they just reported he's the
Pinnacle
of objective reporting
yeah not objective uh about his own
opinion because he's an opinion guy but
objective about who was the president of
the United States
I I don't know to me that's like worthy
of Applause and that's the best of the
CNN can come up with all right um
I'm going to give you
um oh and here's another one I think
they were trying to embarrass Murdoch or
something Murdoch must have testified
and I guess the lawyer said quote you've
never believed that Dominion was evolved
in an effort to delegitimize and Destroy
votes for Donald Trump correct
that was a Dominion lawyer asking Rupert
Murdoch and Murdoch says uh quote I'm
open to persuasion but no I've never
seen it
okay that's why he's rich
is that not the perfect answer
how do you beat that answer
am I right that is the perfect answer
see he's he starts the answer
with yeah probably assuming that this
would get out he starts the answer by
respecting his by respecting his
audience
that is respectful of the audience I'm
open to persuasion
but I haven't but I haven't seen the
evidence
you can't beat that
and they're they're reporting it like
it's a maybe it's a little embarrassing
or something no
if Murdoch were my boss I'd be pretty
darn happy about that that's a good
answer
especially so this is a persuasion
lesson as well
saying you're open to persuasion doesn't
even say you know it's necessarily going
to be facts that change people's minds
that's like the the highest level you
can talk about is like we can be
persuaded but I haven't seen anything
that persuades me
what a perfect answer that is that's the
way you should answer questions like
that
so respect the you know respect who you
need to respect
say you're open-minded talk about the
evidence can't beat it
all right here's your next uh persuasion
lesson this one comes to us courtesy of
uh
uh Newsome Governor Gavin Newsom in
California now I've talked about this
before I'm going to add a little add a
little flavor to it
so apparently
um
there's a
so as you know reparations is a big
question and Gavin Newsom told the
people interested in reparations to form
a little committee and come back with a
recommendation now I've told you already
that that's a brilliant way for any
bureaucracy or any boss to make an idea
go away without saying no
you you just make them go away into a
committee all right so that's the first
persuasion lesson but I'm going to go
deeper
so if the only thing the Gavin Newsom
did was tell the reparations people yeah
I'm open to persuasion
I'm open to persuasion
right just like Rupert Murdoch I'm open
to persuasion
can you go show me the facts you know
give me give me something I can say yes
or no to
see it that's good technique he's
respecting his public
saying
you know go go form a committee and
they're like yes finally we're being
taken seriously good technique
but here's the brilliant part it's not
just about the fact that it will die in
bureaucracy and infighting
it's about the fact that in the end
they have to put it in writing
they have to put it in writing
here's your persuasion lesson
if somebody has
an idea that just doesn't hang together
and couldn't possibly work
and I think reparations is one of those
no matter what you think about you know
the the morality of it as a practical
matter we're Way Beyond the part the way
that you could you could insert that
into current society and get that yeah
and not cause a revolution or something
I mean it can't work
so you also can't price it you can't
figure out who should get it can't
figure out who should not get it so
here's what I would do if I were
if I were in charge of this and I wanted
to persuade it and of existence I would
respect my audience
that say all right you have a moral
argument and it's not it's not unlike
reparations that have been paid for
other things in the past
so that would be respected in the
audience right there are people who care
about it you've got a moral argument
it's not unlike things we've talked
about before
let's talk about it
but then I would go further and say you
need to come up with a number
but because this is so racially charged
I wanna you need to break it down by uh
by race
not just in terms of who would receive
it
but how the tax burden would be
distributed so I'd like to know for
example if you're recommending I think
they went from recommending two hundred
twenty thousand dollars per black
Californian
they've upped that to 360
000
per black California
and
and keep in mind there was no slavery in
California
by the way but that doesn't mean that
people you know didn't come from places
where they were there were
um here's how I would uh ask them to do
it I'd say I want you to come up with
the number and so let's say that's 360
000. figure out what the how much that
is you know per year or what that does
to the budget
and then figure out what each ethnic
group will be contributing to it
so you would say Okay white people you
make a lot of money so you'd be paying
I don't know 40 of it 60 and it'd be
like uh Hispanic Americans now this
would be your share and then Asian
Americans here's how much you're going
to pay uh
for black reparations
and then you publish it and you say
here's the recommendation from our
reparations group
and then you let the public do the rest
all you have to do is ask somebody to
write it down
just write it out and if they don't
write down you know of course they would
leave out anything embarrassing to their
case you just say all right you know
you've got to do both the pros and the
cons I don't want to put the cons on top
of your idea you're the experts so give
us both the pros and the cons tell us
who benefits what it costs who's who's
paying and just really map out some
details here
so you know if I come out that the
average uh Hispanic immigrant who came
across the border on Tuesday
would you know maybe
be on the hook for some of those
reparations too
and then you'd have to you'd have to
deal specifically with what about people
who
live here but are not residents
what about that what if somebody's not a
resident of California but they do live
here
you know they might not have changed the
residency yet do they get paid
because if they do
then what about people who move here
just temporarily to get some reparations
do they get some reparations
how about that
so you simply asked the people to
describe their plan in a little more
detail make sure that they've got the
pros and the cons so there's an argument
both but here's the argument you would
be sure to ask them to include and I saw
this today
equal opportunity activist Ward carnally
as he was asked some California Board
and he got up and he spoke and he said
that there's only one way
to stop all the the crime
and that's to uh he said there's only
one thing that would stop our children
from busting into these liquor stores
there's only one thing that would stop
our kids from busting into these jewelry
stores stealing watches and jewelry and
that's reparations
so I would say make sure you include
that argument like right up in the
summary
you want to put that right up top
um
and not only that but I would highlight
this and have you ever heard me say
Embrace and amplify
I would Embrace this
and I would amplify it
because there might be a lot of other
places we could use this concept of
paying large amounts of money to
criminals so that there will be
disincented from
from a crime what what's that there's a
word for that so there's a word for that
what's the word for when
you pay somebody money not to do
something bad to you
what's
what's it oh extortion extortion right
so the plan here is to sort of morph
from the crimes which none of us want I
mean none of us want anybody breaking
into jewelry stores and liquor stores
and stuff we'd like that then but if we
could just convert that into more of an
extortion kind of a model that might be
something that we could use in other
ways for example
uh we keep talking about using the
military in Mexico
but that was before I heard this idea
we probably could just pay the cartels
not to do crimes
that would be more expensive but so is
war so is war so why don't we use the
word currently idea of paying
reparations to Black Californians as a
way to stop the uh the attacks on stores
because once they had some money they
would have no reason to do it so sort of
one plus one equals two basic logic but
you could just extend that to all crime
really
why why would we stop it there
one of the things I like is if you try
something small and it works hey let's
pay criminals extortion so they don't
they don't Rob us and we should just get
rid of Prisons
there is some amount of money if we save
all that prison money we'll just give
all of our money to the criminals and
then they're going to let us go
and I think that would be one way to
defund police
is just pay the criminals directly until
they have no reason to rob a liquor
store
now they still might rob a liquor store
because it's easier than taking out your
wallet and apparently there's no penalty
for it so it might you know the
convenience factor still has to be
factored in because it might be just
more convenient to pick up the liquor
and just walk directly out the door
especially if there's like one or two
people in line don't you hate that
like you want to pay for something you
plan to pay for it but there's two
people in line and you're like what time
is it I want to get and drink my liquor
so just cut the line walk out the door
we don't have law in California so that
would be a good idea but anyway the
point is that all of that should be in
the reparations recommendation because
you don't want to you don't want people
to think you didn't
think it through
you know people need to think you
thought it through
so that's your persuasion tip for today
uh also
um there's a big unreported thing if you
I'm a little bit disgusted with all of
the uh videos that we see that are sort
of lopsided you know race wise
you know especially in Fox News and on
the right right side of uh social media
you see a lot of videos of it seems like
they're they're focusing only on the few
videos of black people hitting non-black
people all right white or Asian American
or stuff like that and
if you if you think about all the videos
that they're suppressing
it really makes you wonder about these
algorithms for example I've never seen
a video of an orthodox Jew beating up a
black person
you know they exist
but it's probably an algorithm thing
so
the other thing is when you watch when I
watch those videos
I always have the same feeling do you
and I know it's we get so biased because
it's only one type we're saying it's
just one type we're saying one type one
type and there's no way that doesn't
affect your brain and make you more
biased and
when I watch them I just think the same
thing every time
whoever talks about all the hand
injuries to the attackers
every time I see one of them I see
people using their bare hands and Punchy
people into these hard skulls
and they're usually hitting like the
hardest part of the body they're not
even hitting soft Parts like the soft
parts are usually using their boots
but with a they're hitting bare-handed
there's a reason the boxers wear those
big Gloves did you know that that's like
to protect their hands and they're
professionals
professional boxers are protecting their
hands with these big things so if you're
an amateur and you just you're sort of
spontaneously get into one of these
fights
there have to be a lot of hand injuries
and nobody's talking about that
nobody's talking about that
so
I thought we should talk about that all
right vivik uh here's some Vivek
ramaswamy persuasion
about January 6.
so he's using a analogy here he says if
you're prosecuted for an alleged bank
robbery you get to see all the video
footage of what happened
not just the time your face is caught on
camera at the site
that's basic constitutional Law And
Criminal procedure no one should ever be
convicted of a crime without seeing all
potential exculpatory evidence this is
not a right wing or a left-wing issue
Justice demands it High Ground High
Ground maneuver
That's The High Ground maneuver yeah so
I I love the fact that he changes the
frame to uh really a constitutional
thing that every person would agree with
basically literally nobody would
disagree right the thing that makes it a
high ground maneuver is that there is no
argument against it
did you notice that
see there are tons of professional
politicians who will make an argument
when there's an argument against it
now sometimes you can't avoid that right
but if you have a choice
and you can make your argument in a way
that nobody can argue
well that's the best you could do you
can't beat that like by definition you
can't beat something that ever just
shuts everybody down
who exactly is going to argue
that the the accused should not have
access to the evidence
most basic thing in America right you
can't get more basic than that
so yeah that's so that's what ramaswamy
brings to the game and I think he's
going to make all of the Republicans
better
because he once again
once again this is like how many times
have you seen it he set the standard
for how to talk about it and I think
that Republicans have done a poor job in
the past in finding frames that are The
High Ground they they go to the uh
the partisan stuff now the partisan
stuff is how you win stuff in the past
but nobody's ever tried
to use a high ground where everybody
could be happy
politicians typically don't know how to
do it it's actually a rare skill so if
you think this is an accident
this isn't an accident
Rama Swami actually knows how to do this
right you know who else was good at it
for a while
Obama was good at it for a while yeah he
got a little more partisan but
uh for a while he was gonna
all right so Tucker talked to a security
guard who was working on the January 6th
day and
everything about January 6 is disgusting
am I right like everything about it is
not just wrong or inaccurate not just
fake news not partisan it's disgusting
it's just disgusting and I'd have to say
that should be the one thing we could
agree on right left and right that
everything about this is just disgusting
how happy am I that uh violent people
there were some violent people right we
don't know the percentage but how happy
am I that people that I would identify I
would have identified as roughly on my
team at the time and they they go and
like ruin ruin things for all of us I'm
disgusted by that the violence
disgusting right violence is bad enough
all violence is terrible but this is
violent and disgusting
the way the news treated it
is disgusting
the way Congress you know did their
special hearing and you know at least
some part of it was total
is disgusting
they were sending Americans to jail
knowing that they were apparently if you
if you were to take the current
reporting at face value it does look
like
there's a good argument for evidence was
uh withheld I mean I guess that's a fact
right I think we could say it's a fact
that the defendants did not have access
to this video
so that's just the fact right that's not
an opinion
so that's that's the end of the story
that should be the end of the story
right
why in the world
is anybody keeping these people in jail
at this point whether or not they
committed a crime can't be the the
question
that we cannot reframe this as did they
commit a crime the and again I'm only
talking about the non-violent ones
everybody understands that right a
hundred percent of us
I think
oppose the the violence whether you're
left or right you know close to 100 of
us
um
but you know the the left wants to make
it whatever the violence is characterize
the entire thing which is totally
disgusting
just that's disgusting
but
it might be no more disgusting than you
know the right characterized black lives
matter
what so here's a question for you the
question of the day what percentage of a
crowd of protesters would have to be
violent and or destroying property let's
say before you would say it's a violent
uh protest what percent of actual
participants in violent
because it doesn't need to be that big
you know and I think this is where the
bias comes in I think if you're on the
right and you see black lives matter and
one percent of them are violent it's
going to feel like 30 because that's
what was on the news and you're gonna
say that's too much but you wouldn't
know what percentage it was
I have no idea if you said Scott
gun to your head you must you must come
up with an estimate of what percentage
of the black lives matter rioters were
actually destroying things or violent
and I'd have to say first of all I have
no idea
do you
like I I couldn't even guess
if you put the gun to my head I'd say
one percent
gun to add one percent
and that's that's maybe something in
that in that neighborhood if we round
if you round it's probably around one
percent for these protesters as well
what would you say
some are saying up as high as 25 for
um black lives matter if 25 of those
crowds were violent and destroying
things
the rate of Destruction would be
Way Beyond what we've seen I think but
that that's without data that's just
sort of living in the world it has that
feeling about it you know what I mean
sort of sort of my
collective experience of the world says
that if 25 of those crowds were
destroying things there would be no
cities left
I think it's one percent but I don't
know so before you decide that black
lives matter was or was not violent in
their protests or the January Sixers
were or were not violent you're going to
have to figure out what percentage you
would say makes them violent and then
also it would be fair if you treated
both sides roughly the same
that would be fair
in your thinking it would be fair
so I'd love to know that
anyway
um so Tucker talks to the security guard
and uh it's important to the story that
you know he was a black guy he's a Biden
voter Biden voter and
the way he was treated is disgusting now
we may we may be missing some facts but
the facts that are reported based on his
his story is that he was there that day
he was a capital police guy
um he says they were not informed that
the protest was going to be
as big as it was so he thought that his
management failed him for reasons he
doesn't know and what happened was he
says that as he was uh walking through
the crowd somebody put a Maga hat on his
head
and he quickly realized that that was
the safest thing he could do to walk
through the crowd
yeah he must have still had his uniform
on but once he had the Maga hat on you
and he's and he's black right so if you
see a black guy in a capital uniform
with a magi hat in the middle of the
protest
I'm guessing that makes you completely
safe
would you agree
like that hat would be like a force
field
so he puts on this hat in the middle in
the middle of this dangerous chaos
right very unpredictable dangerous chaos
then violence was happening he puts on
the hat to keep himself safe clearly not
a supporter
clearly not a supporter just just
thinking fast and being smart I mean how
would you just I can't describe that
anyway other than smart
that's that's the only description right
he got fired for it
he got fired
because there's a picture taken of him
in the Hat
um
and and then he wasn't interviewed by
the January 6 people
I think oh I'm sorry yeah I'm uh I'm
getting the story a little bit wrong
somebody's correcting me here he was put
on some kind of leave
indefinitely and then he quit
during the leave which lost his pension
or something like that
suspended suspended put on leave
something like that yeah so basically he
would he got a penalty for doing a smart
thing and I don't know if there's a
counter argument I just feel like
everybody turned into a turd at the same
day like the Press you know all
everybody talking about it practically
we all turned bad one way or another it
was like everything was bad from top to
bottom like it was this moment of
you know just extraordinary disgusting
ugliness
that swept over everybody for a little
while it was like a like a mass hysteria
that took too many people in
and I'd just like to forget the whole
thing
yeah I guess we can't forget it we have
to figure out what happened but uh the
faster we get past that the better
all right um
got it of all of all the many terrible
things this one bothered me the most
because he got punished for doing
something smart like that just that
hurts my head so hard as the creator of
the Dilbert comic
right like that that's right in my
fields
I hate that
[Applause]
all right and then I guess this video
now Tucker has that the uh the narrative
about Brian sicknick by some people
and I don't know who had it right and
who had it wrong in the media uh was
wrong I feel as if the media was a
little more accurate that he was not
killed by the protesters
but I feel that the politicians kept
conflating his death as if the
protesters did it does that feel right
to you
New York Times tells the fake story so
on Twitter there was a community notes
put up on a tweet that said the
Washington Post and I think somebody
else Reuters maybe reported it correctly
which would mean some of the media got
it right
but I haven't confirmed that
so my my best guess is that the media
some got it right someone got it wrong
and as long as some of the media got it
wrong that gave that politicians cover
to intentionally get it wrong
I think that's what happened
now what do you think of that
now I don't mind so much that the media
got a story wrong because you know you
have to live in a world where stories
are wrong sometimes
case in point
um
but
I don't know it's just it's just hideous
hideous Behavior by Congress uh they
should be in jail
the the January six people who
perpetrated this hoax now I'm going to
call it a hoax because they left out
they did not provide the exculpatory or
potentially exculpatory I think with the
Q Anon Shaman the video is highly
exculpatory
highly I don't know how much it is for
the other people but at least a little
bit probably
so yeah this is just disgusting all
right so I'm revising my opinion about
the uh
the cartel violence on a car of four
Americans who went into Mexico some
cartel shot about killed two tragically
my first thing was that they knew they
were Americans so when in the initial
reporting
I felt like they knew they were
Americans and they took them hostage
that didn't happen
it looks like they were mistaken for a
Haitian gang looks like they were black
so they'd mistaken them mistook them
there might they might have avoided
maybe avoided a checkpoint after they
went through or something so there's
something that didn't look right and the
cartel guards who apparently there's two
checkpoints
you get across the border legally and
then as soon as you're over the cartel
checks you a second time
did you know that
did you know that the cartel has its own
its own guard post at the border
if you didn't know that
um
so
this is the sort of thing that might
spark a war but my take was if there
would brazenly kidnap Americans you just
have to turn up the heat to 100 and not
100 but you got to turn it up to laser
quality uh but it apparently they did
not
however
there do seem to be lots of actual other
American kidnapping cases they're
probably cartel cases too
so I wouldn't make my case for attacking
Mexico based on this event as tragic as
it was but
um it does make everybody's brains think
you know in a more aggressive fashion I
think so Lindsey Graham's getting
serious about this now uh cartels or the
Congress seems to be changing but I was
watching the five yesterday they had a
graphic about how many cities in the U.S
the cartels have already set up shop
uh don't ever look at that graphic if
you have a choice
it will mess up your brain
I don't know the real size of the
problem because it could be you know
five people in the city count as MS-13
or something I don't know what it takes
to count as having a foothold
but it's a lot of cities
it looked like 100 cities
it's taken like the bottom two-thirds of
the country basically
and
yeah but I don't know if they're
influencing the police departments yet
presumably if they grow they would you
know there's some rumor that they're
taking over from other gangs I don't
know the extent of that
uh
but it's I I think I think the country
is getting pretty serious about uh doing
something about it for a change
uh however I do take Council from
Geraldo Rivera
who's you know anti sounds like he's
anti-using military in Mexico
and here's the argument against it
Wars never work and they never end
so that would be the argument against it
it's just another way for the
military-industrial complex to make
money it'll never end and it'll never
work
now that's not terrible
that's not a terrible opinion I actually
found myself persuaded because there's
such a long history of Wars not working
for America anyway
and
so I think you have to take that
seriously however
as Greg duffel pointed out on the same
show
they're killing a hundred thousand a
year now
how much worse could it be
would it be worse
I don't know it might be worse in a
different way because you'd expect some
pushback but I don't know my my instinct
is that if you do nothing the hundred
thousand gets bigger
and it's already you know
completely
yeah and if and of any reasonable range
of tolerance I mean it's so far away
from anything you would tolerate but
let's consider the alternative
full legalization
would that just make the cartels own a
legal business and that's the only
change they would just figure a way to
make it legal and then they'd still be
in business
or would it only work if the government
provided the drugs for free
or at the same price let's say
could you drive the cartels out of
business by
taking away the source
the trouble is we only have ideas that
can't work
so here are the here are the three ideas
that can't work
do nothing
that can't work
go to war
it might work but you know the odds are
not as good as you'd like
uh or legalize it which would probably
in the short run cause way more deaths
but it would put the cartels on a
business
after we've addicted more people
I don't know
you know does the supply and demand
actually cause more people to be
addicted if it's um
easier and safer to get
or is that just that the people who want
to be addicted already have access it
wouldn't make any difference at all
so it feels like every path doesn't work
doesn't it it just feels like all of
them don't work
but doing nothing seems like the dumbest
you know if if the war makes it worse I
suppose we can stop doing it but we
never do
so I don't know I'd be tempted to Annex
Mexico
that I mean I suppose you could try
getting permission to use special forces
and stuff but
I don't know would that make any
difference
we'll see I think uh military is
inevitable at this point
here's what we the world needs the world
needs what I call a zoom government or
government in a box for situations in
which a government would be temporarily
without a government usually because of
a war or revolution or something so
wouldn't it be good and I'll just use
the Swiss as my Universal neutral
country imagine you had a Swiss entity
that was like organized as already a
government
and they would go in and they would act
as a government for a six-month period
for any country that temporarily didn't
have one
there would be let's say under U.N
supervision something like that you know
just so there's a little bit of
credibility but the deal is they have to
leave in six months
they have to there's just no option
gotta leave in six months even if they
haven't fixed anything right even if
they haven't fixed anything because if
you can't get something going in six
months yeah
probably you never will right so
I think we need something like that I
saw a bunch of people yelling no what
what's the
what's the argument against it
well you could make it an International
Group just just people who are just a
safe competent maybe they're older it'd
be good if they're older so they don't
want to stay there forever
they just take over for a while keep the
keep the lights on
and then you phase them out uh willingly
if there will if they're well paid it
would be not too big of a risk that they
would try to stay and I don't think I
don't think that a foreign power could
control the military very easily right
so I wouldn't worry about the government
in a box coming in and then taking over
the country because they wouldn't have
the Loyalty of the military
the military at best would say all right
we got a problem here see if you can
work it out in the next six months and
then turn it back over to us
economic collapse well it would be
better than no government at all
um
let's check in on the Biden competency
for handling this Mexico Mexico fentanyl
problem and MS-13 to check competency
we'll check in with John Pierre uh see
what she said spokesperson is she said
that fentanyl is currently at historic
lows historic levels under the Biden
presidency all right
so the Biden Administration according to
the spokesperson
can't tell the difference between
how much they catch and how much is
getting in
they actually can't tell the difference
between measuring how much you catch
and knowing how much actually got in
that you didn't catch
as if they can't tell the difference
and that that's who's in charge of it
right now
if you say to me Scott Scott that's the
spokesperson that's just a spokesperson
she she sometimes has a gaff
she's been saying this for a long time
it wasn't just yesterday am I am I right
she's been saying the same thing for a
long time
they act as though
they're not just lying that they can't
tell the difference
that they actually can't tell the
difference
like actually
that's what it looks like I mean you
could say yeah it's just spin but
it doesn't look like it it looks like
they can't tell the difference
all right don't know I don't want to
read her mind maybe she can't tell the
difference
that would be even worse
has anybody seen this new Beauty filter
on Tick Tock where all you do is turn on
the filter and in real time you look
like a beautiful version of yourself
it's it's scary oh and there's a pedo
one where
a man could be a beautiful woman and
stuff like that right so basically you
can turn into anything and you can't
tell anymore
what's different about it is you can't
tell
you actually can't tell
and
there's like good news and bad news the
good news is
um I'm going to look a lot younger in
about a year
because it seems to me that zoom and you
know these all of these services at the
very least they would have a makeup
option
am I right so there's somebody like me
who doesn't want to put makeup on to do
a live stream I would just hit a button
and it would you know just
give me a look as if I had TV makeup on
and you wouldn't be able to tell the
difference it would there wouldn't be
any you know pixels floating or anything
it would just look exactly like me but
better
and I um and I could make myself younger
I could remove wrinkles anything I want
apparently
so what's that going to do to podcasting
when you're looking at somebody who's a
perfect reproduction but the better
version
I guess you could argue that's what
movies and TV have always been right
yeah if you see the real movie star they
don't quite look like they look in the
movies
although I I heard one exception there's
one exception to that so when Angelina
Jolie was in her her let's say movie
making Prime I don't want to say her
prime I'll say her movie career Prime
did you see how cleverly I dance around
that Don Lemon take a lesson Don Lemon
so when she was in her movie making
Prime
I I was photographed by somebody who had
just photographed her not too long ago
so and I asked him about that apparently
she I think she showed up alone like at
sort of the height of her Fame she
showed up to a photo shoot alone didn't
need anybody and he said that she was
the most like the stunning person in
person he'd ever seen
so apparently her her movie Charisma
perfectly translated into a one-on-one
private situation like he couldn't say
he couldn't stop talking about what it
was like to be in the same room like and
he was he was a celebrity photographer
so he'd done he'd done all the actresses
and models and stuff but she was the one
who said yeah that it's the same in the
room
that was interesting all right
um here's a thing that I just figured
out today
and maybe some of you already knew this
forever I've been asking you what's the
deal with everybody hating Soros
right and everybody gets mad at me
but
people wouldn't explain why now of
course there's the vague you know Jewish
thing so I think oh it's anti-semitic
right it's just an anti-semitic Trope
but I couldn't get any more
knowledge or information about where it
comes from why him specifically you know
what's this business and I finally I
finally we went down the conspiracy
theory Rabbit Hole to figure out what's
going on
how many of you knew the following thing
that when uh not everybody
right most of my generalizations are not
everybody
but when people on the right not all the
people on the right
some of the people on the right when
they talk about Marxism they're really
talking about Jewish people trying to
take over the world
do I have that right but nobody's
willing to say that out loud
that's the conspiracy theory right that
from from some document I'm not going to
name from like 1920 there was a fake
document that said that Marxism was
really a cover for the you know some
kind of Jewish takeover of the world
now is that why you're trying to not
tell me because you don't want to say
that out loud by the way there's no
evidence of that it would be crazy now
let me tell you if there's anybody on
here right some there are a few guesses
most of you are saying no
but there are some yeses
right so just look at the other comments
there are some yeses that means that
some people were aware of this
and I just I just heard this this Theory
yesterday actually
uh and finally pieced it together
so
I was always confused why people would
use the word Marxist do you know why
because I don't think it's a persuasive
word
and I kept wondering why does everybody
say you know she's a Marcus Marxist
they're a Marxist BLM is a Marxist I
never understood it
because if you're calling somebody a
Marxist when I hear that I go it's a
different economic theory
whoa like why why are you using that
word
right
um so I just wondered how much of a like
anti-Semitic
variable is built into that when people
use that word because I would I don't
think I'd ever use that word I'm not
there's something going on
all right so here's my take on
conspiracy theories
here's how to tell what is not a
conspiracy theory
when too many people are allegedly
involved that's never a conspiracy
theory
never never this is never a conspiracy
theory so this whole worldwide you know
Marxist are really it's really a Jewish
plan to take over the world is imagines
that there's like plotters everywhere
and every you know nobody's talking
about it but they're all connected
that's never a thing
that is never a thing
I guarantee you that's not a thing but
if you told me that 50 Intel people who
knew each other signed a document and
conspired to lie about hunter's laptop
I'd say 50 is a lot
but if they were all Intel people who
knew each other I could see that right
so that's not too many people given that
they're Intel people who know each other
but as soon as you say worldwide
like that there's nothing like that yeah
nobody can nobody can maintain a
worldwide you know 100 year
plan
now that doesn't mean that there's
nobody who ever said it you know 100
years ago it doesn't mean there there
aren't people who you know actually have
that belief
but there's somebody who has every
belief
so I feel like the whole uh we don't
like Marxism thing
even if it's the exact correct word it's
not persuasive
and it has this tinge of the
anti-Semitism on it that doesn't seem
persuasive like why would you use a word
that's that's already slimed by uh
anti-Semitism you wouldn't you wouldn't
want to use that word it's not
persuasive
so I don't know what the alternative is
because Marxism covers like a a
description of a larger thing
but not Marxism
yeah let me uh
let me speculate a few things
if you changed it to systems over goals
it gets closer
like marriage having a traditional
family is a system
isn't it
whereas Marxism I have a goal of
everybody being treated equally
um
free markets are a system
whereas Marxism of course both have
systems but Marxism is goal oriented
like to get to a place where I don't
know the government controls everybody
if you have that point of view or get to
a place where everybody's equal
or something like that so instead of
Marxism versus I don't know free markets
or capitalism I would go with something
like systems that were
and systems that don't
and the ones that don't are always the
same reason the systems that don't are
either focused backwards you know my big
point of the week they're either
backwards looking at victimization
or they don't take into account
um
incentives
so you know you could almost uh say
uh
systems with incentives versus systems
without
you could say people who have systems
that are well designed
versus systems that are designed to fail
yeah maybe that's the way to go we favor
systems that are designed to work and
have always worked they're based on
human incentives and everybody getting a
fair access Fair access that's a system
that works
A system that doesn't work is removing
incentives
you know baby there's another way to say
that but here here's my big persuasion
thing as long as Republicans and
conservatives are using the word Marxist
they are on a scale of one to ten their
persuasion is a one
that that's my opinion a scale of one to
ten saying marxists they're all Marxist
on one to ten that's just a one
it's probably hurting you more than it's
helping you it's so bad but there there
have to be better ways to do that
uh the story about musk mocking the
disabled employee do you believe that
happened
do you believe that headline
musk mocked a disabled employee
is your first instinct that that's
exactly right and there's no context
that needs to be added
would it would it change your mind if
you knew that musk had no idea that the
person was uh disabled nor did anybody
else because they had the conversation
in public on Twitter
he found out later
and when he found out later and he also
made some other assumptions about the
guy
uh he apologized in public
and people were saying how dare you be
so insulting to the disabled guy my God
here's here's my standard for Behavior
do I judge people from by making
mistakes
nope
I never have because everybody makes
mistakes that's a ridiculous standard
this is a reframe as well judging people
by the mistakes and this is in the book
that just got unpublished uh making
mistakes is what everybody does I try as
hard as possible not to judge people by
the mistakes but rather to judge them by
how they handle their mistake because
that that's more thought is put into it
and more more character is you know
exhibited so musk learned what the real
facts were and apologized
in a completely adequate way in my
opinion
um
that's as good as it gets again
he's being criticized for a behavior
that I don't you know
nobody nobody let's say nobody condones
a mistake it's just
it's kind of dickish to condemn it like
it's not it's not so out of range of
things that we've all done and thought
Oh I better go fix that right
it's not like he ate a baby or something
but it was pretty funny I like that he
defaults to the funniest approach to
everything
no you I feel like part of uh Elon
musk's operating system is that if there
are two things you can do and they look
you know sort of equally you know risky
in terms of risk reward they'll always
take the funny one
and I think he said something that
suggests maybe that's actually in his
mind
all right
I saw a good theory today that uh some
some person who had inside knowledge
about Putin
the Putin has a young mistress who's
basic basically like a wife and has kids
or kid I think kids and so he has a
young family
and he has you know great mansions and
everything he wants and so the argument
is he's not crazy so the odds of him
launching a nuclear war which would kill
his young family
that you know I saw pictures of him
looking at the the woman who was
apparently confirmed as his mistress he
looks in love
like the way he's looking in the
pictures is that look like I'm not going
to lose this
and and she's not like
uh I mean she just she just looks like
somebody who had a genuine connection
with him just based on a few photographs
so that's a pretty good argument and
that was the argument that I made
without without the details that it
wouldn't be rational for him to start a
nuclear war it would never be good for
him personally
all right the problem with statistics
do you know why the why statistics is
even a thing that people have to learn
depending on their career why why was
statistics even invented well let me
answer that question for you it's
because our common sense
fools us
routinely
common sense is so opposite of what
statistical truth is that we end up
getting in you you saw in the last week
without getting into details again
there's a bunch of argument about
whether a poll was accurate or not
the people who criticized the poll said
oh it's such a small sample therefore
cannot tell us anything
and then I would say well it only has an
eight percent margin of error even at
that small number assuming that the
sample was corrected you know was
collected appropriately
and I would just get like stunned
silence
because eight percent wouldn't have
changed any conclusion from it
so
it's not that's not obvious
and what people would say is how can 130
people represent 100 million people
and I would I would sort of have to just
hold my tongue
because I wanted to answer sarcastically
how can how can a small sample represent
a large population
that's called statistics and polling and
that's exactly the description of it and
the yeah yeah and then the confidence
interval
tells you how confident you should be
based on how small your size is
so really really basic stuff people
don't know about statistics but
this brings me to Charles Barkley
disagreeing with
um a let's see ESPN commentator named
Kendrick Perkins
and Kendrick Perkins suggested that
there was racial bias in the MVP votes
because since 1990
uh the only people who won MVP without
being in the top ten of scoring
now that sounds a little suspicious on a
Surface doesn't it that somebody could
be the MVP of the entire league ever
and not be in the top ten of scoring
doesn't that sound suspicious to you and
the only time it's ever happened is with
three white players
but but honestly you don't think there's
scoring would be sort of five to one of
importance compared to all of the other
things because remember it's fans voting
right or no is it fans voting or
is it the professionals voting
who votes for the MPP the of fans and
and the Press who covers it so Sports
writers no fans
I'm getting mixed messages here
uh Sports writers
so we think it's Sports writers who do
it okay so what it seems suspicious to
you
that three the only three times that it
wasn't they weren't in the top ten of
scoring they're all white guys
and there's another one
um
there's another one that's up for it I
guess or got one
and then Barkley says
uh you can't tell me because the numbers
don't make sense does he know how many
vote does he know how many voters are
white actually or did he pull 80 percent
of that of his ass so I guess Kendrick
must have said 80 of the voters on that
are white
uh my point is if only five white guys
have one MVP in the last 30 years that
makes zero sense his argument zero sense
because if that was if that was the case
we'd have a lot more white MVPs wouldn't
the numbers be way way worse
so Barclays sort of statistical you know
instinct is that if if 80 percent of the
voters were white
uh and racial bias is in it
that
um
that we see like mostly white winners
does that make sense to you
that makes sense to you
neither of these arguments make any damn
sense
neither side makes any sense right
because neither of them have any data
neither of them have any data and if
they did would the data tell you
anything
probably not let me tell you why the
data wouldn't tell you anything
um
and I'm going to surprise you I'm going
to surprise I'm going to side with
Kendrick Perkins
I'm not going to side with Berkeley I
like what Barclay's doing
I think what Barclay's doing is trying
to just take race out of the out of it
which I love which is why Charles
Barkley is like way on the top of my
list of people I would want to vote for
if he ran for politics like he would be
way at the top of my list I just love
that he's lived a life where he can sort
of laugh about racial stuff but you
never think he takes it seriously that's
like
such a good like place to start so I
like his instinct to try to take the
energy out of it and stuff like that but
here's what I think
if you were the uh let's say most of
them were white nobody knows if it's 80
but if if most of the writers who were
were voting every year do you think that
white people would have the following
thought
and I'm going to speak as one white
person who would think the following way
but I'm not going to say that they do
all right so I'm not going to say that
somehow I uh that somehow uh represent
white people here's what I would have
done if I were in that group I'd say to
myself what's good for what's good for
the game
and then I would have voted
appropriately
if I were a sports writer
especially white but maybe also black
I'm not sure why it would especially be
different
but if I were voting I would vote for
what's good for the game
and sometimes what's good for the game
is that a few white people win sometimes
because maybe if you only did the top
scorers it would be nothing but black
winners and you have probably way more
white audience
and to me it seems like the writers were
some somewhat subconsciously
subconsciously
balancing it out so that it would it
would sort of look like
um something closer to balanced
and it might be that you know maybe it's
been since Larry Bird that like a white
guy should have won
I don't know if that's true but I would
have to say it does look a little
suspicious to me that the the white guys
are the ones who win without being in
the top ten of scoring that's not a bad
point is it
is that a bad point
but I don't think it's exactly the way
he's describing it I think I think you
could allow for two types of racism one
type of racism is the bad kind where
people are just voting based on race
the other kind is also
incorporating race but more trying to
find a balance of just what's good for
the game
it'd be good if some white people won
once in a while
because there are a lot of white fans
is the sort of same sort of thinking if
if the situation were reversed now
that's how probably how I would devote I
have to admit I probably would vote
based on if I thought there was some
unfairness or inequity I might vote in a
way that would fix it I can imagine that
I don't know if I would just be like oh
who had the best stats because it's not
really even about the best stats is it
because because beyond the stats some
some players consistently make their
team win when they're on the field
that's actually the best stat the best
stat is how they score when that one
person is playing that's that's the one
I like the best
all right so I guess we don't know I
guess my only point is that without data
and without uh being statisticians and
none of us in the story are
statisticians that I don't think
Kendrick Perkins idea is crazy I would
just say it might be more of a good
purpose to it or at least good intention
than bad intention but probably there's
a racial component to that
a walk agenda might be banned in Iowa so
the House of Representatives is looking
at something to ban uh
the Dei bureaucracies and our
institutions of higher education
do you think that'll pass
Iowa's solidly Republican are they no
they're not
is is Iowa
in the legislature they're not right
yeah so does it have a chance
wouldn't you need a solid Republican
legislature to have a chance with
something like that
so I don't know what the odds are I
guess
I guess I should have brought it up
uh so here's a just latest update on me
but I'm not going to go into any detail
on this now so the Chris Cuomo interview
I did about my
um
my so-called racist rant TM trademark
should I try to get a trademark on
racist rant
no probably too soon but nearly half a
million people have viewed it
and the best criticism that came out of
it was from Dan Abrams
who said that I can't have it both ways
I can't say that my statement was
hyperbole but also out of context
um
yes I can't
the statement I made was a sentence of
hyperbole
and the reason that I did it was the
context that was left out
it's pretty easy to do both of those at
the same time now consider the fact that
that was the best objection there were
other objections but the other
objections were based on things I didn't
even say
or didn't even feel or was mind reading
right the best objection was that you
can't have it both ways when obviously
you can
very easily obviously
you could have it both ways it's just
two things it's not two opposite things
it's just two things
I can have an apple and an avocado at
the same time do you know what I can't
have I can't have an apple and not an
Apple at the same time
that would be a you know if uh Dan
Abrams made that point and said he says
he can have an apple and not an Apple at
the same time and he just can't do that
no Dan I can have an avocado and an
apple
same time no conflict
so
you tell me your opinion I've asked this
on the locals platform I'm going to talk
to them privately in a minute but uh
on YouTube
has the narrative about my little drama
shifted in my direction
once you realize that all the the
adjutants you know the people who just
like to make trouble The Click Horrors
and the trolls once they get bored with
it
does it look like things started moving
my way or no
so I'll ask both of you
so people are seeing different things
so what you should say is that some
people see it and some people don't
which is what it looks like so best case
scenario because you it's not possible
to persuade everybody not everybody sees
everything
but for the people who have been exposed
to the context
everything looks pretty good
so I'm gonna leave that the reason
here's a little media tip if I didn't
give you this one the reason I'm leaving
uh that one interview up there and I'm
turning down others is that as soon as
you have more than one it turns into a
court case
you know what I mean
so the the Cuomo interview hit all the
points I needed to hit so I was just
leaving it there as one consistent thing
because the moment I talk to somebody
else
somebody is going to
illegitimately say you said two
different things even if I don't more
likely they're going to miss the context
and because they miss the context on one
they're going to say well you're lying
because you said this and this one but
you said this and this one and it won't
be true
both of them will be completely
consistent but the news only has to tell
you they're inconsistent and you go down
so I just leave it
you know leave it with one story as long
as possible and the next thing the next
part of the play
is I want to see if there's any uh let's
say semi-legitimate news organization
who decides to tell the whole story
like as a story
so in other words would uh I don't know
New York Times or something say actually
there's a way more interesting story
here that connects to a larger Trend
which is the whole thing I was trying to
do is connected to a larger trend
will anybody tell the whole story
of why I did it
how I felt about it from my perspective
not guessing you know no mind reading
and then
describe my strategy for handling it my
intention for doing it and also how I
reframed
once I had your attention I reframed
from all the backwards looking
strategies for success to
forward-looking ones and then also
reframe from you know looking at the big
picture of systemic racism which you
have to work on rather focusing on
individual success so even if you don't
fix systemic racism you can just slice
through it like a hot poker through
butter
and there's a reason I always repeat
that one because it's visual
and it's repetition
so you'll know if I won
here's how you'll know if I won
if you hear anybody in the media refer
to
strategy as looking backwards strategy a
rear view mirror strategy or planning
for the past
and then they compare it to looking
forward and how can we work together how
can you learn the tools of success
Etc if you see anybody in in the public
eye who starts using that frame
that would be probably for me
because it's sticky
and it's The High Ground of maneuver all
right that's all for now YouTube I will
talk to you tomorrow
bye for now
