hey
everybody come on in here you know you
want to because you know that it's time
for coffee with Scott Adams I'm Scott
Adams many of you are not
and if you are prepared you have your
mug you have your cup your glass your
chalice your Stein perhaps a thermos I'd
like to think you filled it with your
favorite beverage I like coffee now join
me for the simultaneous
sip good
stuff so let's talk about
AOC I want to not talk about her but I
can't I can't help it I don't know if
it's just
that other people talk about her and so
I just want to you know I'm I'm being
persuaded by the
herd or was my original analysis of her
way back correct that she's a master
Persuader and she can hold our attention
like nobody else well I'll tell you what
the
uh uh I'm having a fascinating time
watching the uh the reaction of mostly
Trump supporters when I say that she's
persuasive and people they holler they
yell and they're talking about her and
of course they talk about her some more
so it seems that people have conflated
the concepts of being
persuasive with the concept of being
right they're very different
things I am completely
convinced that AOC who I call rpos for
racist not point of sale um so she is
racist but she's also persuasive but is
she right about let's say her most
recent uh statement is that although
they chased amazon.com away why
shouldn't the city use that money that
they were going to give to Amazon in tax
breaks why couldn't they just use that
money for New York City stuff you know
for uh lowering the taxes of low-income
people for investing in the city and
other people said
AOC you don't understand anything about
economics but wait a minute let me
see I want to look at her
uhz I want to look at her educational
background uh um hold on hold on
forgot she's looking at on television
right now stop
that yeah it's so hard to do a search
for her because her name is too
long Cortez give me a moment there's a
reason for
this we're going to look at her
educational
background so she has a ba from Boston
University what was her major
let's see if I can find
that majored in international relations
and economics at Boston
University she had a double major
international relations and
economics so do you think that someone
with a double major in international
relations and economics from Boston
University and by the way she graduated
kumla
Kum loudy Kum loudy come Loud come
loudly uh c m space l a u d e I think
it's pronounced come loudly no wait
that's something else
um so so she could have been suum
loudly but that's still pretty good for
double
major now here's the question to you do
you believe that she doesn't understand
that tax breaks for Amazon were really
about them not paying as much taxes as
they
would um ordinarily or does she think
that the that the city took some of its
own City money and was going to give it
to
Amazon it's an interesting
question somebody says she minored in
economics I'm look and that might be
true but I'm looking at uh Wikipedia and
it reads exactly this that
aesio Cortez majored in international
relations and
economics so it says she majored in both
but it's possible that she
minored if Wikipedia is wrong but in in
either case do you think she doesn't
understand
that and I'm asking the question without
actually knowing myself I don't know I
don't know if she understands it or not
but I'll tell you what I do
know doesn't matter
it doesn't matter a bit because she's
only talking to the people who want to
believe that that she's talking to
people who want to believe that the city
should have been nicer to its residents
and less nice to the biggest corporation
in the world are they the biggest
they're up there um and so her
message is quite
persuasive to the people she's talking
to she's not talking to Republicans
if she did I imagine she would change
her message to be more compatible with
persuading Republicans we no longer live
in a world where it makes sense to even
bother trying to persuade the other team
the best you can do is is persuade your
own side and maybe you tip a few
Independents if you get
lucky so
uh so here's the open question we don't
know why she
understood but if she's a master
Persuader uh chances are it didn't
matter the details what probably
mattered is that she she told the
simplest version of the story which is
that she's supporting the the low-income
people and not the big
corporations I guarantee you that
90 5% of the
public doesn't know what's wrong with
that
doesn't know that CNN was going to
produce money and then not pay all of it
to the city that's different from the
city taking its own money and giving
some of it to um to Amazon now there is
uh apparently excuse
me now that's not a completely accurate
description of the situation as AOC
clarified herself in a tweet the part of
the deal was they were actually going to
give I think 500 million in capital
improvements or whatever to to Amazon so
there so there was a chunk of that there
was actually money from the city that
was going to go directly to Amazon so
that part is real and she got that right
but the tax breaks are not something
that you can give to the citizens or
give to the give to the company because
the tax breaks for Amazon were going to
be tax breats on income that they had
not yet earned and had never been earned
before in that City so it would have
been
a tax break on new money as opposed to
taking the money they already have and
giving it to Amazon all right I think
that's clear enough anyway my point
is the people who are telling me that
AOC is not persuasive if assuming that
they understand the difference between
being persuasive and being
correct the people who say she's not
persuasive are
deeply um cognitively blind on this
topic maybe not on other topics but on
this topic they are cognitively blind it
is objectively
true that her persuasion is dominating
our conversation I'm talking about it
you're thinking about it we're tweeting
about it she's in the news every every
Democratic candidate is essentially
being compared to her they're all being
asked about the green New Deal and I
have to admit the green new new deal as
crazy as it is in terms of being
impractical has started to infect our
thinking so that before we could have
said I I don't even need to talk about
that stuff it's just crazy now we're
talking about it now suddenly we're
asking questions like what is the best
way to get to Universal cheap education
remember we were talking about that's
impossible before and now we're talking
about but what's the best way to get
there I saw mark cubin
tweeted recently he he asked a little
Twitter poll I think it was yesterday
and I I tweeted that around and he asked
um people's opinion on the idea of
making people's most local state college
free to them so the his idea was that
perhaps at least floating it as a
suggestion that perhaps the only
practical way to get to Universal free
college with people who want to pay more
given that option they can pay more and
go to a different College if they want
to but Universal free college would be
making the you know I assume upgrading
the most local College to you so that
anybody wants to go there
can now when have you ever heard that
suggestion because that's sort of the
capitalists version of getting as close
as you can to something like free
Universal
College um without going full
socialist so when you see Mark Cuban who
is by no means a socialist I don't think
anybody would call him a socialist when
you see him seriously talking about not
if you should have free college or if
you should not but saying how what's the
best way what's the most practical way
is there one is there even a practical
way when you you see that conversation
happening it is unambiguously true that
AOC is moving the needle now you could
say Bernie got things started and I
think that would be a a very defensible
position but you cannot say that she's
not moving the needle because you're
seeing it as clearly and as objectively
and and and as me measurable you could
do Google searches Google Trends on
every possible Dimension it is
unambiguous ly clear that she's changing
how we're thinking about
things I don't know that it's bad now I
think it would be terrible if everything
she suggested got adopted just the way
it's you know drawn out in in its
initial form but it is not terrible and
I I'm going to say this as confidently
as I possibly can it is not terrible the
people with as much juice as as Mark
Cuban are publicly asking the question
how could we best get to free public
education you see other people talking
about uh online education is the way to
get there I've suggested that as
well and maybe it's some combination of
online college plus a physical place I
can tell you here in California and I
don't know how common this is the the
local community colleges offer a pretty
robust range of online classes so even
if you're going to the local College
here a lot of those classes you're just
doing on your
computer and that's very common now it's
not unusual that's actually the common
situation now so to see people like you
know major
capitalists asking about how to get
there and could we afford it and is
there a way it makes sense is a real big
deal and I think that she's part of that
even though that's not exactly what
she's talking about perhaps
um and likewise um you see people like
me talking about how do you get to free
health care for everybody or less
expensive Healthcare those are those are
questions that I think we spend more
time on now because there is such a
thing as the extreme
left now I forwarded around this morning
on Twitter there's another Twitter um a
CNN clip in which van Jones is once
again the only reasonable person on the
panel um and he was reasonable in the
sense that the the conversation was are
Mega people sort of all bad and one of
the panelists actually took a run at
suggesting that maybe all Mega people
are actually kind of
bad right there on television so right
on CNN now she didn't the panelist did
not say it explicitly but her suggested
that well maybe they are kind of all bad
fortunately the voice of reason for CNN
van Jones was there to say that's the
most
unproductive way to think of this I'm
paraphrasing but the idea was that you
wouldn't you wouldn't want you know as a
black people would not want anybody to
say all black people are bad that's like
literally the biggest problem so why
would they do it against some other
group when it's you know clearly not
true that they're all bad it's it's the
worst it's the worst way to organize a
society when you think that just
belonging to a group makes you bad
because you're part of a group now
that's true for the KKK but it's not not
true for you know being part of a
demographic group or being part of a
political
party
um all right
right
um all right I'm looking at your
comments
here yeah there's the story about the an
IRS agent leaked
some tax information to avanetti I can't
think of a worse disgusting thing than
that uh but it's not it's not much of a
fun story all so somebody's PR me to
talk about 6G so apparently the the
president tweeted that we wanted to get
to 5G which would be the the faster
internet after
4G the F the faster wireless internet
and and then he said maybe even 6G and
then the fact Checkers said wait a
minute there's no such thing as 6G what
is this President talking to and I
remember laughing and thinking to myself
um there might not be a 6G but don't you
know what he's talking
about isn't isn't this once again
directionally accurate if it's true that
there's a 4G and of course there is
because we're all using it and it's true
that we're working on
5G why would it not be true the sooner
or later there's going to be something
like a 6G now if it's like all the other
G's everybody will argue about whether
that's real 6G or it really 4g+ two or
you know people are going to argue
whether things are truly 6G or not but
it is not wrong to say that if we're if
we're looking at going from four to five
that maybe we should look past it to six
even if we don't know what six is yet a
perfectly reasonable thing to say that
people attacked him for being
irrational um
oh thank you for the super heart I
appreciate
that all right
um so I've got a little bit of uh the
flu so let me tell you about a
conversation I had
yesterday uh in this two movies and you
know two movies on one screen
World um when I said I had the flu I was
talking to somebody who said
there's no such thing as a stomach flu
have you ever heard that that there's no
such thing as a stomach flu that's a
myth and I said of course there's such a
thing as stomach flu the kind of flu
where you're
vomiting and I don't have that one
luckily but uh so we made a bet so the
BET was is there such a thing as a quote
stomach flu so of course I do a Google
Search and the Mayo Clinic comes up as
one of the top search reviews and it
says gastro intis which is the official
name and then in parenthesis stomach flu
right so the source is the Mayo Clinic
so that's my source the Mayo Clinic the
Mayo Clinic says the technical name is
gastroenteritis parenthesis stomach flu
who wins the
bet who wins the BET does stomach flu
exist or does it not exist because it
was put in
parenthesis well the person I was
talking to claimed Victory because there
is only an official diagnosis called
gastroenteritis that's what you would
find in the medical books but in common
usage parenthetically stomach
flu I do you do you need to know how the
concluded it concluded with both people
thinking that they had won based on
looking at the exact same
information exact same information Mayo
Clinic
gastroenteritis par parenthetically
stomach flu and still with this simple
example now most of you are you know
you're watching this Periscope so you're
you're biased in my favor so you're
saying I won now it doesn't matter that
I thought I won and it doesn't matter
that maybe you think I won what matters
and this is the point of my story is you
can't convince somebody else that you're
right even if you're looking at it there
is no amount of evidence no amount of
proof no amount of seeing it with your
own eyes that makes any difference to
anyone people are completely
unaffected by facts that they're looking
at right in front with them it's it's
quite amazing now I could also say that
that's I'm really just describing what
happened to me because I think the other
person would say um you saw it right in
front of you that it has a name it's
called gastroenteritis and the medical
name is not stomach flu that's just what
people call it so I won everybody gets
to win because everybody sees the world
they want to see
all
right was this another wealthy person uh
no
comment somebody says I am a doctor you
are wrong
um
so from the doctor's P perspective
whoever whoever it was that said you're
a
doctor please give me a
detail so is it true that there's a flu
virus
that can affect you in your stomach in
the sense that it will make you vomit
and the answer is apparently
yes all
right can also gastro entis can also
refer to food poisoning oh that's
interesting so you can see you can see
reality
changing right in front of you so a
moment ago didn't you think
uh Mayo Clinic was just being
politically correct you lost look look
at the different comments and you're
watching you're watching what you
thought was reality shifting right in
front of you because you're you're
watching new people weigh in and saying
uh I'm a doctor you're wrong
Etc somebody says if you're left to
Bernie why are your followers
right well that's um a good
question um I'm left of Bernie but I
also try to be objective about what
works and I mostly started writing about
persuasion specifically the the Donald
Trump version of
persuasion which made me appear very Pro
Trump and so people who were Pro Trump
for their own reasons found common cause
with me because I say good things about
uh his persuasion and I say good things
about his outcomes when they are good
but I also say bad things
when when things are not working out for
example I think he you know I disagree
with him on statutes Confederate statues
I disagree on um health care so there
there's things like
that somebody's asking me about when
tokens for donating so we added a a
donation button to the when the
interface by whenhub app that's
available now and so anybody can sign up
to accept
donations um at the moment it is is not
hooked up so that you can donate wed
tokens but that's uh that's a a
future a future thing we'll do all
right winning an argument doesn't mean
you were right someone says that is
true so people always ask me what does
it mean to be left of Bernie and I'll
give you my answer here here are some
examples conservatives or general
against abortion Liberals are generally
okay with it under the right conditions
and on left of that you know I'm sure
Bernie is pro abortion under the right
conditions but I'm left of that in
saying that um men such as myself should
voluntarily keyword voluntarily keyword
voluntarily keyword voluntarily I say
that three times because as soon as I
say it somebody's going to act like it
wasn't voluntary keyword
voluntarily should opt out of the
discussion
meaning that women collectively if they
come up with an opinion that's a
consensus as a man that's what I'm going
to
back CU I don't think women as a group
are going to come up with a much
different answer than men would but
their decision is more credible because
you have a life and death death decision
going on here and I'd rather have the
most credible decision rather than the
one that's my personal
preference uh um
said magic word should well should is
okay in common language but not as a
substitute for reason I gave my reason
which is credibility so when I said that
uh
men right you're saying should it should
without a
reason is is just a trick should with a
reason is a proper usage so I gave my
reason that's a proper
usage um I should have I should have it
would have been more
helpful to have said the first time I
made that comment about the word should
if you're lost in this conversation I've
said in the past that when you see the
word should in an argument somebody's
trying to get away without using a
reason now that's if the reason isn't
there but if somebody says you should do
this because it will save money
the reason's there so that's the proper
use of should but should without a
reason makes you think that the reason's
there without mentioning
it all
right
uh then uh I'm also left of
burning on uh
religion so conservatives tend
to uh believe in the Bible
uh Liberals are a little bit more likely
to be non-believers although many of
them are probably most of them um and
I'm left of that I think we're probably
a
simulation so there are a number of
examples like that U
but none of none of that
less and another example is I I think we
should have you know I think healthc
care that's affordable and available to
any much and as well as education that's
affordable and available to everyone is
a good standard to look for but I don't
think we can get there just by raising
taxes we have to get there more cleverly
sort of the I'll call it let's call it
the Mark Cuban approach you know there's
probably a capitalist friendly way to
get to the things that the Socialist
wants want but don't know how to get
there
capitalism let me say this better I'll
turn this into a quote so you can have a
py
quote capitalism can get you what
socialism wants faster than socialism
can get it for
you dash Scott Adams so that's the frame
that I think is most useful capitalism
can get you what socialism
wants better than socialism can get it
for you so nobody wants people not to be
able to go to college nobody wants
people to have big college loans nobody
wants people to not have um yeah I'm
talking
about nobody wants people to not have
access to Affordable healthare it's just
how do you get there and the and the
capitalists believe that you could get
there better through capitalism even if
it takes a long time even if it's ugly
even if they're you know bumps and
setbacks but it's sort of the only path
that we understand the the Socialist the
pure socialist path to get to those
things seem consistently bad
oh let me let me talk about the most
important thing in the world right now I
feel as though there's always one most
important question that that people have
one uncertainty one one bad framing of
things that becomes the biggest problem
in the world and let me tell you what I
I think that is have you watched
conservatives try to explain let's say
on television let's say pundits writers
have you we watched conservatives try to
explain why socialism is a bad
idea because I have I've seen quite a
few people try to explain it and every
time I watch the
explanation understanding that I already
agree with the point all right so I'm
starting from a position of thinking
that capitalism is better than socialism
so I'm already on that team and then
when I hear conservatives explain the
advantages or the disadvantages of
socialism I think to
myself I I don't know how those dots
connect because you hear things like
socialism always leads to
dictators that might be
true but I don't know what the
connecting tissue is I don't see the
cause and effect I don't see the clear
path from that so it always
rings as
trying to tell me that socialism is a
bad idea they do such a poor job of
persuading that I end up thinking well
maybe it's a better idea than I thought
if somebody doesn't have a good reason
against it I mean I was already biased
in favor of capitalism and still you
can't give me an argument that sounds
good to me and I'm already on your side
and so I ask you this and maybe you
could do this in the comments have you
what is the argument against socialism
in in one sentence so here here's a
little test for you um I'm guessing that
the vast majority of you probably at
least 90% of you are clearly on the the
socialism is bad train you know because
that's who I attract to this this
Periscope uh social it's against the
will of the people but that's that's
every tax is against the will of the
people uh depends on
altruism not
persuasive
uh lacks the protections not persuasive
centralizes power not
persuasive stay sanction seal stealing
not persuasive it's anti voluntary not
persuasive uh it's a failed system not
persuasive so all right so I have been
given several
points what have I taught you about
arguments which have several
problems it usually means people don't
know um stop using the Marxist word
capitalism just stop it is capitalism
you're ridiculous it's ridiculous not to
use that word that's a ridiculous
comment
um has to be sensually
controlled all right so here's the
problem when people talk about the
problems of socialism they give you
seven different
reasons but none of those reasons are
like they feel right they just feel like
you're trying too hard let me put it
this way the when people talk criticize
president Trump and most of you are prot
Trump um when they criticize the
president have you notice that they
they're all over the board it's not one
thing he does wrong it's like oh there's
this and this and this and he did this
and he said this and he said this and he
did this and he did this and he did this
so it's not this one problem we have
with the president it's 15 of them
whenever I hear that I know that people
don't have clear
thinking I have to go in a minute um so
if there were one maybe two good
criticisms of socialism people would use
those and that would be the end of the
story so they would say socialism is bad
here's my reason
by the way there are seven other reasons
but the only one you need to know is
this one
reason right yeah and I'm watching more
reasons go by inefficient no upward
movement blah
blah so the antisocial ISM argument
needs to be fixed because if the best
you have is that you'll turn into
Venezuela and then the other side says
no we'll turn into Europe and Europe is
fine you don't have an argument so let
me say
um in you know in my estimation of
things the only thing that creates
progress is a sufficient amount of you
know pain and selfishness and that if
your system does not recognize people's
selfishness and greed you don't have a
working system but I don't know if
that's persuasive so let's work on a
good
argument of
of capitalism or let's say you know a
capitalism with a little bit of
socialism the way we have it now versus
a more pure form of Socialism and let's
see if you have an argument so and
here's here's the terrible argument the
worst argument is food shortages that's
not a reason that's not a reason that's
a projected outcome but where's the
reason you know there is a reason but
you didn't list it disincentive to
work do Europeans have a disincentive to
work you would have to demonstrate that
the people in Europe are disincentive to
work because what if somebody says what
if the lowest 20% of the lazy
unproductive workers don't work are we
better off or worse off I don't even
know all right but I got to go got to do
some stuff and I will talk to you later
while you're working on your
anti-socialism arguments
