well it's Monday and we're going to have
a show it's going to be a good one as
soon as I'm
ready which will be in one
moment all right looking good over there
we got comments we got lighting we got
notes looks like it's
showtime good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams I'm pretty sure you've never
had a better time if you want to take
this level up to oh another level I
guess that's better than anything you
can even imagine with your tiny shiny
human brain all you need is a CER muger
glass a tanker chel or th a cting Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee join
me now for the unparallel pleasure
dopamine of the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens right
now
go well I remind you if you're feeling
lonely the S simultaneous Sip and the
local community will fix you right up
because I spend at least an hour a day
with all my favorite friends on locals
all right here's a little update I think
I told you that uh somebody reads my DMs
in the
morning and not all of them just a few
and I can actually watch it happen in
real time so I can open my DMs and watch
all the new message indicators be there
and as I sit there I can watch just some
of them
disappear just two of them it's always
the same too
and the first time happened it took
about 15 seconds from the time the
indicator showed up to the time it went
away by itself with with me not touching
anything and so I thought hm I wonder if
it's there's a
bot but this morning I got up you know
God awful early as I always do and the
new message indicator
stayed and I thought oh maybe there's
not somebody reading my messages or
maybe the bot has been turned
off and then eventually they
disappeared which means it's a human
which means that I get up before the
person who reads my messages gets up
literally the only reason that they were
still
alive um now there's nobody who asked my
password and trust me nobody has my
password uh not not my ex not anybody
else it's a unique password nobody has
it so I'm going to change my password
after we're we're done with this today
uh and I'll eliminate I'll eliminate the
option that somebody has my password the
reason I'm sure that they don't is that
there's two Factor
authentication meaning that if it
doesn't come to my personal
phone I can't get in you know it sends
me a code to my phone and I've done that
recently so there's no way somebody
could have gotten in without it so it's
either a state actor or an
Insider or the weirdest bug in the
world but it looks like I just watch it
as somebody's reading my messages and I
I think that's actually the truth I
think all of my messages are being read
at this
point all right here's some good science
news is fun uh Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology came up with this
new way to make a mechanical eye now
it's not for people but apparently it's
a it would be a huge Improvement in
robot
Vision now that might not seem like a
big thing but it would be huge for
driving and navigating and understanding
in the world um so your robot might soon
have eyes that are way better than what
you what you think a camera could
do um here's another weird one you know
how you think that your genes are in
your body and you know where your genes
are and science knows where your genes
are and those genes are sort of fixed
when you get born and then they
determine much of your life well it
turns out that there's some free
floating genes outside your Je
enome what uh study by Columbia
researchers shows that bacteria break
that rule and can create free floating
and ephemeral
genes uh raising the possibility that
similar genes exist outside of her own
genome meaning that there might be
something like genes that you pass on
but there might be some kind of genes
just sort of floating around out there
well that's
weird aliens
never
know all right and we'll get to the uh
politics in a moment but the Guardians
reporting that there's a new kind of
insulin uh that uh sits there and it
adjusts um it adjusts you only when you
need it so the current way is if you
need if you need to adjust your I
insulin sugar levels what however you
would describe this you would give
yourself a shot that corrects what you
need at that moment but the new stuff
the new
stuff looks like it can do the correct
thing on its own at least for about a
week and then you have to reup it but
that'd be kind of amazing imagine if the
drug made its own correct decisions
about your insulin levels as you went
that that would be such a a game Cher
for a gazillion people anyway let's do a
propaganda alert propaganda alert so
kako the great is reporting on how uh Dr
Epstein you've heard of him he studied
Google and how Google can change the
election outcomes by how they surface
different uh searches and according to
Dr
Epstein uh the Google political bias
which we would imagine is both
intentional and pervasive uh flipped the
2020 presidential election the 2022
governor's race in Arizona and Georgia
and the Senate majority from Republican
to
Democrat so apparently this is It's
Based on data and Dr Epstein um I don't
think I've seen him
debunked which is interesting it seems
like everything gets debunked doesn't it
even if the debunk is not real you know
somebody takes a run at debunking
everything I don't think I've ever seen
anybody try to debunk
Dr Epstein's claim that you can measure
how much Google influences an
election um I'm very biased toward
believing this is a real thing but I'd
love to hear any
Counterpoint and I would advise you this
is just a good a good mental hygiene you
know if you see something that agrees
with what you think is true you should
really wait to see if there's a
counterargument and we've we've been
listening to these accusations or
allegations from Dr Epstein for a few
years now and I've never run into
anybody so if you've seen anything if
you've seen anybody who's got a
counterargument um can you exit to
me all right so if nothing else
changed uh Google would just determine
who your president is so do you think
you have a republic
do you think that when the founders
designed the country if they had known
that Google can decide who your
president is would they have designed it
the same way or might they have some
restrictions on social media if they
knew what social media was when they
found it the country well I don't think
that the men who were pooping in holes
in the ground and created the
Constitution I don't think they saw
Google
coming so if any of this is true we
don't have anything like uh democracy or
really anything like that all we have is
a brainwashed state which is how I see
it uh
axos axios is reporting that uh the
voters prefer Harris on the
economy do you believe
that do you believe that the polls
suddenly went from everybody likes Trump
versus Biden do you think that they just
reversed because it's colal
Harris I just laugh when I see this
stuff now if if you were a uh if you
were a casual consumer of news you would
believe this because it's coming from
axios it says for the first time this
election cycle voters trust the
Democratic candidate more than former
president Trump on the economy according
to new polling released by the financial
times and the University of
Michigan I don't think
so all
right I don't think so so I would put
that in the category of absurdly obvious
propaganda you know unless it's just
they did their math wrong or they pulled
wrong or or there's an enormous margin
of error because it's a small sample I
don't even have to look into
it uh I think it's so obviously not
true that uh you know we'll find out
we'll find out if I'm wrong I'll let you
know is that a deal to me this is
laughably stupidly obvious
propaganda if it turns out that you know
a whole bunch of other polls agree that
people suddenly magically flipped to
Comm haris on the economy which makes no
sense at all it's the same policies you
know except for tax on tips which he
copied from Trump um I I'll tell you I
mean if it turns out I'm wrong I will go
eat some Crow right in front of you and
I'll be happy to do
it um NBC news says the Biden
Administration what there's a Biden
Administration NBC news seems to think
that we have some kind of a government
that's functioning what well I didn't
know about that but that's good news we
have a government hey everybody hey we
got a government that's doing stuff look
at that look at us you other countries
aren't you a little jealous yeah you
thought we didn't have a government but
we do we do they're doing something
they're unveiling a new multi- agency
regulatory initiative to Target
Corporations that uh are wasting
consumer time and money by needlessly
burning them with red tape in order to
maximize profits
and I say to myself whoa on the surface
that sounds mighty good do you know how
hard it is to cancel a subscription to
anything it it's obviously made
intentionally hard so if the government
made some law that said you have to make
it easy to get your money back and you
have to make it easy to
cancel I think I'd like
that I think I would and unambiguously I
would just like that so if the Biden
Administration can do that that that's
great but let me give you just a little
Caution before you get too happy about
the Biden Administration removing uh red
tape let me say again how they're going
to remove the red tape because you know
you don't like all that bureaucracy and
red tape and you know extra complication
when you don't need it right well here's
what they're going to do they're going
to unveil a multi-agency regulatory
initiative oh okay never mind it's not
going to work as soon as you put
multi-agent regulatory
initiative you that just sounds like
something that will never happen oh we
got to get all these agencies to agree
on all these different thing it's not
going to happen in six months if you
think this can get done well the Biden
Administration is still in office I
doubt it I've never never seen anything
get done in 6
months well the Associated Press has a
headline at least on X it says uh Harris
is pushing Joy Trump paints a darker
picture will mismatched moods
matter mismatched
moods
what what do you mean this is total
propaganda it's the propagandists that
are telling us that Trump is dark and
see propagandist that are telling us
that cackling is
Joy I I don't think the public is is
registering any of
this and the the Associated Press widely
believed to be a pure
propaganda uh entity when it comes to
politics uh they they just sort of
uncritically say that Harris is pushing
Joy I think they're pushing Joy
Reed it is it joy asn't happiness or is
it just Joy re like crazy
batshit
stuff so here's what I think um I think
that the idea that Trump is dark came
from their dark persuaders in 2016
they're just you know reupping that and
the the whole idea that Harris is
cackling is joy I love this you know
from from the perspective of somebody
who likes watching in Persuasion and see
what works and what doesn't watching the
Democrats morph uh idiot cackling into a
joy they're making it
work I'm kind of impressed honestly I'm
I'm not joking that's actually
impressive now the candidate is still
terrible but they have
managed to successfully come up with
another explanation for the cackling
like an idiot I mean I didn't see that
coming like whoever did that is actually
I think very qualified to do this so
there's somebody in that Harris team now
I've heard some people say it maybe it's
Obama's you know smartest people helping
her could be because it's feeling it's
feeling kind of Obama likee you know
Obama was
hope so Joy is just the new version of
Hope let's bring some joy to this
country anyway um telsey gabard is going
to take legal action against uh Biden
Harris Administration for putting her on
a terrorist watch
list
what so the allegation is that Tulsi
gabard simply for being a Critic of the
administration and nothing else this is
the allegation nothing else no other no
other danger nothing they put it on a
domestic terrorist watch list so when
she flies I guess she would be followed
around and there' be extra
scrutiny now as she
says uh my own government my president
my commanderin-chief this is where it
gets dark so to speak is targeting me as
a potential domestic terrorist the
closest word that comes to mind is a
complete sense of
betrayal this next part hits me pretty
hard Ju Just put yourself in a
position quote after serving over 21
years and continuing to serve in our
nation's military my own government has
labeled and is targeting me directly now
as domestic
terrorist wow
that really hits
me um you know when you're just watching
politics and you're just saying oh I
call you a name you call me a name you
tell some lies my team told some lies
none of it really you don't really feel
it so much but I feel
this like that that word
betrayal 21
years still in the service
she's still in the
military I I mean is this even
true do do we have confirmation that
she's been targeted on the you know
potential demestic terrorist list
because if it's if it is as alleged and
I I think there's still a fog of War
situation so you know maybe there's
something more to the story we don't
know but I don't think there's something
to the story that would suggest she's
done anything that would put her on the
terrorist watch list I'm pretty sure
that's not
real you know I feel confident in that
so it does look like the government
targeted her for being a
Critic now there is history of people
being targeted for being critics
obviously
but uh somebody in the
military th this
is this is deep
that that's really
deep well I uh I wish her the best and I
hope she can give some justice out of
that
and um if I were her I would resign in
the military
immediately I wouldn't serve in the
military if my commander and chief were
trying to Target me now she of course
she's got a long history she's got you
know maybe lots of different reasons to
continue being uh in the military but uh
if my commanderin-chief targeted I'd
leave immediately and I mean I would
just be so
gone
wow well speaking of suing the
government Colin rug and some others are
reporting that apparently Trump is
planning to sue the Department of
Justice for $100 million for the raid on
his maral Lago property Fox News is
reporting that I guess and
uh Trump's lawyers are saying that uh
the raid was done with quote clear
intent to engage in political
persecution so correct me if I'm wrong
but by suing that would mean that the
communications uh would all be available
to us publicly meaning we would actually
see what the Department of Justice was
saying in a variety of ways about the
The Raid now I don't think anything's
going to happen before the election
because everything takes too long but
wow here's what I
expect do you want to make a
prediction I'm going to make a
prediction the critical communication
between somebody and somebody else was
accidentally
deleted you want to make a bet on
it uh I say that critical Communications
will be accidentally deleted by the
government oops we were doing a system
change over
and we lost all of that
communication
oops uh I guess Russia hacked into us
and they must have erased all of our
email you watch they they will literally
just delete it and say it was an
accident how many times have you seen
our government
Democrats uh delete something and say
what what oh it's just an accident it's
all deleted we can't find it we looked
really hard but it looks like maybe
somebody came in and the dog ate it
that's what I
expect well Joe Biden came out of
whatever hospital bed he's usually in to
lie to uh some Network I think it was
CBS and I forgot how much I hated that
 oh my God so let let me just say
as clear as possible Biden is probably
our worst president in my opinion but
he's a bad human being he's a really bad
 person and let me just give you
an idea of what he said and by the way I
would like to compliment KL
Harris now if you compare KL Harris's
approach so far you know she's she's of
course making some hard claims against
the Republicans but I would say within
the bounds of normal political Behavior
you know seems outrageous but outrageous
within the bounds
Trump is also outrageous in my opinion
within the bounds so they're they're
sort of similar in that way Biden is not
Biden
is either deeply Disturbed or just an
evil human being I think he's just a bad
person like a really really bad person
like deeply bad like you've never seen
before bad and I'll just give you my
take on
it he actually said this quote every
time every other time the Klux Clan has
been involved they wore hoods so they're
not identified under his presidency
talking about Trump they came out of
those woods with no hoods knowing they
had an
ally I almost can't even finish
this so he gets debunked he gets
debunked on the fine people hoax
instead of apologizing to the country
like a good person would oh I'm sorry uh
I've been I ran my entire campaign on
the fine people hoax and then when it
was debunked by Snopes and everybody
else he goes away for a while and then
he comes back and instead of just saying
okay I've been I ran a campaign on a
hoax and maybe I even knew it that would
have been the
truth instead he changed es it to he can
read the minds of the Klux Clan which
they were not the clan although there
might have been some overlap um he reads
their minds and he decides that they
took off their
hoods um because they thought Trump
would be an ally he says that's how I
read it they knew they had an ally in
the white house and he stepped up for
them so he's changing his calling them
fine
people so that he doesn't get fact
checked he says he stepped up for them
did
he how what would be the example of how
he stepped up condemning them totally in
public is that the stepping up you evil
 you piece of
 and now I'm not talking politically
this is not a political comment he is a
broken useless rotting piece of
I've never seen anything as bad is this
in in American politics this is the
worst thing I've ever seen in
American politics and some you know I've
seen things where people got killed this
is
worse this is the worst human thing I'm
not even talking politically as a human
 being this is completely
unacceptable completely
unacceptable and you know I'm I'm pretty
comfortable with the fact that all of
our politicians are lying all of our
politicians are exaggerating they're all
you know painting the other side
irrationally and you know untrue that's
all sort of normal and we can deal with
this is different this is really deep
and dark and bad and it's not even
political it's just you're a bad
person what a piece of
 and then he continues with Trump is
quote a genuine danger to American
Security really why don't you
ask somebody to kill him again because
that's what it looks like to me to me
this looks like you're calling for
violence and it looks like you're
setting up the country for it and you're
warning them so that when you take the
action that it looks like you're
planning to take then you will say well
see I told you he was in favor of the
 KX Clan you lying piece of
 lying piece of
Congressman Jamie Rasin is telling us
that even if Trump wins they plan to use
the Congress to disqualify him under the
14th amendment by lying and saying that
January 6 was an Insurrection and that
he was an
insurrectionist they planed to take him
out of office with
 if they don't get somebody to
kill him first
so we've got an election system that is
designed not to be
credible meaning that if you wanted it
to be credible we know exactly how paper
ballots show IDs vote on the same day
have people watch when you're counting
them in some cases you might have to
count them twice if somebody has a
question we know how to do a credible
election the fact that we don't
is very clear evidence that whoever
makes these decisions doesn't want the
public to understand how the vote was
collected what else could that
be but you if if we're acting like
adults for one second what else could
that be it's a what it's exactly what it
looks
like so we've got the biased Google
we've got the biased media we've got a
system that doesn't even look like it
was pretending to be real we've got the
Congress saying that they won't even uh
accept the outcome of the election
they'll use some weird lawfare to get
rid of them with the 14th Amendment and
we've got Biden actively saying that
he's a danger to America which increases
the odds that somebody will take a
violent
act dividing the country like nobody's
business that's a pretty deep evil now
we see the weaponized Department of
Justice we see the weaponization against
telsey gabard we see somebody reading my
DMs on X every
day do you think that's a trump
supporter let me ask you I mean somebody
reads my DMs before I watch them I
actually watch them do it I watch the
new indicator go off while I'm looking
at it on my private messages on the
DMS now do you think some Trump
supporter did that of course not they
would have no reason to so it's somebody
on the other side side or another
country I don't
know um on Morning
Joe uh one of them said it's I don't
know who said this but quote it is no
mystery Donald Trump is never going to
graciously concede defeat in this
election he is already laying the
groundwork for what's going to happen
after November I think this is going to
be an extraordinarily dangerous
period so that's what they're saying
about Trump
so they're running an
election with a system that they know is
not credible to at least half the
country and then they're worried that
when they run the system that is not
credible to half the country and they
get in a result that doesn't look
credible that the voters will
Rebel of course they will of course they
will you've created a system that
guarantees it are they trying to create
this or they trying to avoid it if you
were trying to avoid it you would fix
the holes in the election system if you
want to create it you leave the holes
and then you warn everybody I think
they're going to complain when we cheat
so they're creating a situation that
they can cheat and then they can put you
in jail when you complain about it
that's what they're setting up they're
going to cheat presumably I mean uh I
don't know that because I'm not a mind
reader but all of the signals are
they're creating a situation where they
can and will cheat and then they'll put
you in jail if you complain about it
just like January 6
basically
so all right uh rasmuson uh polling
company is having a fun time mocking the
other polling companies because it's
been quite a few days now that uh for
reasons that are unexplained and quite
mysterious only rasmason is updating us
on the um the race between Harris and
Trump now rasmuson said things haven't
changed that much and that Trump still
has a commanding lead in the
polls the other the other polling
companies say that's not the
case and they hav an updated their polls
in a week or
so huh You' think they'd be jumping to
update those polls don't you because
what could be more persuasive than an
updated poll saying that Harris hasc the
lead but yet they seem to be relying on
slightly outdated
polls hm what could be the reason that
they would be so tardy with the new
polls well I don't know but rasmon is
having a lot of fun mocking the
competitors and eventually they're going
to have to present a
poll we've seen some that look so
sketchy when you look at the the tabs
you know the the subcategories
uh at least one recently looked absurdly
obviously fake so maybe people are doing
a lot of thinking how they can do a poll
that looks real and isn't that's
probably what's going
on that's my guess I don't trust anybody
this
week um Harris is claiming um now I did
say that Harris is not the terrible
terrible person that Joe Biden is but
she's pretty bad I will just say that it
seems to be within the unfortunately
normal political realm and Biden's well
outside of it at this point and so she's
saying that uh Trump will if Trump gets
back in office he'll Target the lgbtq
community like he did the first
term and I
said
what why don't I know about this I I'm
very Pro lgbtq community
so if I'm if I'm Pro
lgbtq and Trump targeted them in his
first
term why didn't I hear about
it is there some news I missed well
luckily you have um comml Harris here to
fill you in on the details of how we did
it he banned Trans in the
military wait is that targeting
trans you know who else is banned in in
the
military people with no arms and
legs is he targeting
them by Banning them in the military how
about people who are 100 years old can
they join the military or are they are
they being targeted targeted and banned
no now of course because I'm not a
 idiot I'm not comparing trans to
100y old people I'm not comparing trans
to anybody they are their very own
person the only the only uh point of the
examples is that the military is the one
place we explicitly allow
discrimination discrimination in the
military is part of it by
necessity we discriminate against people
who are too dumb Too Short too fat too
unhealthy too
old and and a lot of uh gender stuff too
there there's still things that women
can't do right in the military so if
you're going to tell me that you want to
run a military you want to be the
commander and chief and you want to get
rid of discrimination in the
military I'm going to have to be I'm
going to have to be brutally honest here
it's so that's something a woman would
say this is why women should not be in
charge of National
Security now I'll clarify that can there
ever be any woman who would be good with
National Security of course Tulsi if
Tulsi were this commanderin-chief Tulsi
gabard I would say well there's a woman
who can definitely be in charge of
security for the country so on an
individual basis everybody's you know
everybody's an individual
but generally speaking women don't have
the same feeling and reflex and millions
of years of
evolution to know how to defend anything
and again there are exceptions Tulsi
gavage would be an obvious exception
anybody who served in the military male
or female I would say it would be you
know right on the top of my list of
somebody who could do that job but kis
hasn't better in the
military
and I think this is just
stupid the thing about trans is whether
it would be more
expensive or would create more downtime
for the the people in the military now
that's just data if we have data that
says that trans cost more or creates
more health problems while you're in the
service that's good enough good enough
for me and I'm protrans Pro lgbtq I mean
for adults of
course so I think this is really
revealing of how unable KL Harris is to
be
commander-in-chief the military has to
discriminate otherwise you're not safe I
want
big capable
people all right male or
female um so K Harris says that Trump uh
took away the protections for lgbtq
under the Affordable Care Act does
anybody know what that refers to I mean
I know what the Affordable Care Act is
it's Obamacare but what is that why is
there no detail what what is what
exactly did she take
away does anybody have
any any insight into that at all is that
just made up I think it's just made
up or there might be there actually let
me correct that there's probably
something to the story but why haven't I
never even heard of it and if she's
tried to sell it shouldn't she add a
detail here's what it should look like
uh he took away the protections for the
lgbtq under the Affordable Care Act and
then it should have said they used to be
able to do this and now they can't what
did he take
away but if you're you know a Democrat
you hear that you're like oh he took
away stuff well how about what can you
give me an example of what he took
away and then uh she says uh that Trump
took away lgbtq worker protection for
employees he
did when did that happened does anybody
remember him taking away any protection
for
lgbtq I'm pretty sure I would have been
opposed to that pretty sure I would have
heard about it what is he what is she
talking about now there might be
something to it I'm just saying that if
you're going to try to sell this as a
reason of over you kind of need to add a
little bit of detail what exactly did he
take
away anyway so there's a political
strategist Lindy Lee who posted on X um
and she said this Republicans mocked
Harris for her laugh but it was her
secret weapon then racist mocked her
name but they were just exposing
themselves then they mocked her words
but her words became a meme then they
mocked her Joy but joy was her greatest
strength the GOP has nothing on
comma so I'm kind of
impressed they actually turned her idiot
cackle into a
superpower as opposed to saying that
she's drunk and bad at talking in
public pretty
good if I'm going to judge it for truth
of course it's ridiculous if I judge it
for persuasive power
for her own base pretty good I I think
they sold this Joy thing
completely yeah you you see all the the
cat ladies uh jumping for joy and
singing and dancing they do seem happy
and and every time they see you know
Harris and Walsh with their dumb laughs
their
faces they think well there's some more
joy
coming yeah anyway so the DNC I guess
that's next week in
Chicago and uh a week before the DNC
this is according to political Playbook
a week before the DNC the party has yet
to Define his priorities for Harris if
she should
win uh and then their one of their
writers says Rachel bade says much of
the blurriness is intentional and I saw
a Joel paac of Breitbart saying that
kamla is running as a generic Democrat
and I thought to myself oh that's it you
know you keep saying where where are
policies where are policies why doesn't
she have any written policies on her
website the reason is she's running as a
generic
Democrat if if you run as a specific
person you've got all kinds of flaws but
if you've ever seen any polling where
they say all right Donald Trump versus
Biden okay he beats Biden because Biden
has dementia Trump versus KL Harris at
least for a while we'll we'll see what
the new polls say uh you look like you
would beat her because she's sort of a
weak player didn't even get a much in
the primaries
but if you say that you're that Trump is
running against a generic Democrat if
you were to PLL that the generic
Democrat would do well do you know why
because every generic Democrat the
actual voters they would be pretty
generic Democrats would say oh I'm a
generic Democrat
I like that better than Trump so running
her as not a person but as a generic
Democrat pretty
smart again it's not honest but we're
talking about politics you know nobody's
that's not even the standard people are
really holding anybody to uh but as a
persuasion yeah the less they say about
what she would do and the less you hear
from her the or she is the generic
candidate and the generic candidate
beats
everybody it it's so smart that I'm
having
trouble like telling myself it's
intentional because it's almost too
smart but I think it's Obama
smart you know I I think there are
people within the Obama universe who are
smart enough to know that running a
generic Democrat is their best way to
win so it's it's actually impressive
honestly Katherine herriage has a scoop
on some Department of Homeland Security
whistleblowers three of them who claim
that uh they're being targeted um after
they pointed out that the the Border
people are not taking DNA samples of uh
the criminal types that they catch at
the border now apparently there's some
requirement that the DNA is um gathered
from anybody who a criminal I assume
that's so later if they do something or
come back in the country you can catch
them more easily I don't know I don't
know what the point is but the
Department of Homeland Security is not
doing it have you noticed that every
action from the Department of Homeland
Security seems to be designed for one
and only one purpose to let as many
people into the country without
supervision as possible now I'm
exaggerating because I think the app
that they use and the the information
that they collect when they come in uh
through a legal door way even though
they're not citizens um I do think that
we collect a lot of information on them
and maybe that keeps us safer so I don't
know too much about the details of this
story but there is a claim that they
were they were retaliated against I'll
tell you this is a bad world to be a
whistleblower whistleblowers get
hammered every
time you if you going to be a
whistleblower you got to you got to be
willing to throw your career away for
sure well do an update on the uh Tim
wals Stolen
Valor story uh I remind you that having
not served in the military I do not have
a personal feel for this topic I can
simply observe it and see that other
people have a personal feel for it but
uh Mike covich I think has done uh a
very smart and effective job of you know
making sure everybody's heard this issue
and all of its
Glamour
and I think he was always right about
it's too late to change sort of the
general Democrat but if you can find a A
specific group of Democrats that might
be willing to act differently because of
a specific
topic um then you might be able to move
a few people and that might be the
difference so that's what looks like is
happening
um but the best part of that was JD
Vance went on
CNN and I love JD Vance on CNN the same
way I like vake on CNN you have to be a
certain level of
smart to treat them the way they need to
be traded and both of them can do it so
here's what JD Vance does
um so he go he goes on CNN and Dana Bash
um is trying to explain that uh walls
did not do anything wrong so she says
that he W he resigned from the National
Guard months before anyone knew that the
deployment was
likely so that would be a pretty good
defense if that's true if it's true that
he resigned before anybody including him
knew that deployment was
likely that would be a good argument
that you know it's not a Stolen Valor
how did JD Vance handle
this new information from CNN's Dana
Bash that wals resigned months before
anybody knew there was going to be any
deployment here's how he
responded he noted CNN's own reporting
from the night before that from wal's
Superior officer that said the superior
officer knew and that wal definitely
knew about the
deployment now you don't get much better
than that did Dana Bash
say oh that's a good point our own
reporting showed that this wasn't true
the thing that I just said and thank you
for pointing out that our own reporting
reliably because we had the actual
Superior officer on camera for an
extended period and we asked him many
questions and he was very consistent in
his answers yes thank you JD Vance for
pointing out that I had
incorrectly categorized CNN's own
reporting on this issue is did she do
that no I think she changed the topic CH
changed the
topic JD Vance for the
win all right what about uh have you
noticed that Harris keeps copying Trump
stuff but you know like the no tax on
tips and suddenly she's for stronger
border control Etc so people people are
saying wait a minute you're going toward
the middle but you're really going
toward Trump I think it's more than
that so look at some of the things we've
seen
lately there was wal and the campaign
calling uh Republicans weird
specifically Vance and Trump so there
was a weird attack then wals did the
mind your own business attack then they
did the stronger borders you know they
want stronger borders no tax on tips and
then uh they just the campaign the Trump
the Harris campaign just posted on X
that Trump hadn't campaigned in the
swing States for a week and they said
low
energy do you see how good this is
persuasion wise you don't have to like
it but persuasion wise here's what
they're
doing when they called uh when they
called the Republicans
weird that was that thing where they
call the Republicans the thing they are
or the thing they're
doing the biggest complaint about the
Democrats is not that they just do a bad
job but it doesn't even make sense it's
just like it's just
weird right now I'm not making the weird
argument I'm just saying the Republicans
look at what's happening and they go
that's you're just being weird so they
turn it around they grab the grab the
gun and flip it around and say you're
weird and then they they sort of capture
the initiative on who's weird pretty
good that's strong
play uh likewise when wals did the mind
your own damn business and leave us
alone that's a pure
Republican message get the government
out of our our business and he did it
before you know he did it sort of early
so he gained the initiative on the
government the Republican government's
going to try to control your body now he
had an argument you know the abortion
would be the the argument for the
government getting in your business but
if you take that argument out of it it's
a big one but it's the only one that is
that flavor otherwise it's the
Republicans trying to get the government
out of your pockets but it's good
persuasion because they took the
argument and then the borders and the
attacks on tips again they just took
Trump's argument so it it neuters his
argument if they're saying the same
thing he is and then the low energy
thing was sort of the tell that was the
one that pulled it all together for me
and I was like wait a
minute Trump actually does have low
energy this
week that's really good they actually
turned the energy thing on him who saw
that coming now that that's a home run
because the the Harris energy is through
the roof at the moment uh Trump has laid
low and he hasn't made you know mostly
just
complaining and you know he would say
he's not laying low he's doing podcasts
and stuff like that but he's not doing a
rally and a in a swing state I guess for
a few days so regardless of the truth of
the claim that's not what I'm arguing
I'm arguing that as a persuasion
approach instead of doing what Biden did
which was destroy the country and call
us all Nazis which because he's just a
stupid piece of what is doing as
smart her whoever is advising her is
kind of killing it you know they're
they're doing the most you can with what
you're working with because you're not
working with much but wow for what
they're working with the advisers are
killing it so look for more of that
let's see if there's more of Democrats
trying to steal the message and and get
ahead of it so they can be the ones who
are championing the message so that
whenever Democrats say hey that was our
message it just sounds like me too it
sounds like well maybe you should have
been a little stronger and faster with
that if it's your
message all right uh here's the other
thing that the Harris walz ads do have
you noticed how generic a lot of their
complaints are because they can't go for
they can't go for
policy because Trump generally wins on
policy with the
public so here are the things they've
gone for uh Trump will steal your
democracy Trump and Vance are weird
Trump wants to control your
body and now the newest one for their
new ads are Trump and Vance are in it
for
themselves do you know what's missing
from those
attacks who has better
policies and who's a more
capable
leader don't you think those should be
somehow into the conversation of who's
going to be your capable leader how
about your policies and your
capability nope no no policies and
capability stuff we're just going to do
conceptual things and what do the
conceptual things buy you a generic
Democrat if KL Harris were leading with
policies and those policies were let's
say even a little bit you know tweaked
to be
newish it would look like policies
policy against policy and then Trump
wins because people like his policies
better which is why of course K Harris
is copying some of them on the border
and no tax on tips so they have to do
this totally generic thing he's going to
steal your democracy they're weird he
wants to control your body and they're
in it for themselves every bit of that
just leaves your brain as soon as it
enters but it's not trying to be
persuasive on these topics per se it's
just trying to be generic which is
pretty
smart all right the New York Times is
reporting that uh uh climate change
might be reaching a Tipping Point now I
don't have a uh subscription to the New
York Times but I don't need
one let's see it's an article that says
that we might be reaching a Tipping
Point or heading toward it for climate
what would be in that AR article that I
didn't read well I believe it would be
climate experts saying that they have a
model that predicts that we're heading
toward a Tipping
Point what part of that would I believe
none none of that
so uh Michael lean black sent me that on
a DM this morning because i' I'd sent
him some stuff showing that some of the
predictions hadn't worked out so the
there's a prediction on polar bears
that's wrong because apparently the it
was hunting polar bears that was killing
him so when they stopped hunting them
now they just came
back did you know that that that the
polar bears have you know doubled since
that they were there at their low and
mostly they just start stopped shooting
them so it turns out it wasn't the
weather so much as the shooting them so
when you cut down on the shooting them
more polar bears how about that and then
there was a great Barrier Reef That was
supposed to be destroyed and it was
almost destroyed and there was no coming
back I came back or it's on the way
coming back which shouldn't be happening
according to climate change that's the
opposite of what should be happening so
I I sent uh Michael those things and I
said probably some things you don't see
he sent me the New York Times article U
about the Tipping points and here's why
they talk about tipping points again I
don't have to read the article to know
this
why do they talk about tipping
points it's because the predictions
didn't
work am I wrong now again I didn't read
it so if I'm stupidly guessing what's in
the
article I say that you don't do Tipping
Point persuasion until prediction
persuasion fails now the predictions are
fine in the beginning but after 20 years
or so people are going to say how'd that
predict ition work out and then you look
and you see that it didn't so if the
predictions haven't worked for 20
years and by the way there would be
people who claimed that they have but
based on the things I see they they
haven't
um you have to abandon the prediction
model of persuasion because it didn't
work so you have to move to something
that could never be proved do you know
what could never be proved that we're
heading toward a Tipping Point
there's no way to prove that you would
just use new models the same models that
didn't predict are going to predict a
new thing that you just can't measure so
next
year I'll say well where's that Tipping
Point and they'll say well not yet I
mean it's coming and then the year after
I'll say Tipping
Point not in two years I'm just saying
you know in 20 years definitely Tipping
Point and 20 years go by and no Tipping
Point what do you think they'll say h we
were wrong about that Tipping Point no
they will update their models and
they'll say yeah we're a little off on
that but the new models much better new
models say the Tipping Point 5 to 10
years and then we'll sit there like
idiots again say oh here comes that
Tipping Point no Tipping Point is
something that nobody can predict
because there way too many variables and
to imagine that they can is stupid
but at the same time could there be a
Tipping Point yeah
maybe but I don't think there's anything
that humans are going to do that would
make it tip or not tip I do think that
the world changes temperature all the
time it's never the same like it's
always going up for a long time or down
for a long time that we know for sure so
with or without the human uh element in
it accelerating it they would say um
is there a Tipping Point now if you
thought a Tipping Point was coming what
should you
do I would take the vake um risk
management approach which is make sure
we have as much energy as possible and
the strongest economy and the most
educated population so that we can deal
with every
challenge because the Tipping Point is
going to destroy everything all at
once you know it might make a part of
the ocean not fish it might make some
place harder to farm while it's making
some place else better to farm so there
would be massive
adjustments but I doubt everything's
just going to fall apart
so anyway um I mentioned to uh Michael
that uh you know I'd explained to him
how the pred the prediction models are
all fake now the the fast explanation
for that is if you had ever had one
prediction model
and then you followed it for 20 years
and it was pretty close to the actual
temperature I'd be saying to myself wow
it looks like they have a model that
works 20 years in a row and it's kind of
right right in that range where the
actual temperature is not exact but I
would be impressed by that but suppose
you had a 100
models and 10 of them look pretty good
after 20 years what would I say of that
we've got 10 good
models no I would say this is a scam if
you have a 100 models 10 of them are
going to be
close probably I'm just picking numbers
but some of them are going to be close
so the 90 that weren't close what do
they do they go back for funding and
they say if we just tweak our model a
little bit we've learned something from
those other models uh we'll have an
accurate model too but we've got our own
flavor of it it'll be good if we have
this extra model so they get funding so
they tweak their model and now it has no
history because it's tweaked so you
don't know how it's worked it's brand
new now you got 100
again so 90 that got replaced or updated
10 that were on target then you wait
water watch a few more years and within
the original
10 seven of them stopped working but a
few of the new ones that got tweaked
right on target so now they throw out
the ones that aren't working keep keep
the ones that are and go forward is that
a prediction
model
no no that's a scam that that's just
hiding the fact that the prediction
models don't work if you have enough
prediction models and you can trade them
out and tweak them every year which they
do and and keep and replace them you're
never predicting anything you're only
predicting that if you have a lot of
models some of them are going to be
close that's it that's said so I said
that to Michael and he uh he responded
with a
uh let's just say uh what I took as an
insult to my
character and so uh I decided he was
toxic and told him I never wanted to
speak with him again and uh blocked him
because I'm really sick of
Democrats listening to an argument about
a thing and then saying well you're a
Nazi
or you're you're a narcissist I think
that's where that was going or your ego
is too big or you've been you've been
hypnotized how about talk about the
whole argument for once how
about that and I'm so done with toxic
 and to me it looks like a
lot of the Democrats are just toxic
personalities and you know not that
they're I'm not saying that's limited to
one side but most of the people that I
see
are just
toxic and it's so obvious that there's
just something wrong with the
personality not the argument the
argument isn't even there it's just
toxicity so um my uh every every time I
deal with people it seems to not work
out
anyway
um there's a
report from uh George web investigative
journalist and I haven't seen this
anywhere
else so I don't have a sense of The
credibility to assign this I'll just
tell you that it's out there so it's on
X you can look for it George Web Two B's
in
web and what he says is that the uh the
guy who tried to kill Trump this guy
Crooks um that he has encrypted overseas
bank accounts totaling $4.5 million
do you believe that that uh that we that
we know that the shooter has encrypted
bank accounts that could only mean that
there's some outside
influence
it's it here's my problem it's too on
the
nose you know what I
mean because we're all saying to
ourselves hey does he have outside help
if he had outside
help that would be probably crypto
payments you know in today's world so
there they are there's the crypto
payments now did George web really find
these but law enforcement did not and is
there nobody else who could find these
so I'm not going to sell this as
true I'm going to sell this as a story
that's it's out there to be
evaluated but I would wait
for you know a lot more confirmation
so I don't have a sense of this one I I
don't even have a guess well I do have a
guess my guess is that it's not true and
the the guess would be based on just the
simple rule that it's to on the
nose if other people confirm it then I
again I'll apologize to George web in
public and I'll say good Scoop and I'll
will recommend that you follow him but
for now
doesn't it doesn't meet my personal test
of I need a little more than this a
little
more all
right um pichy Keenan writer on X says
someone offer a $1 million reward for
swing state ballad fraud Insider to come
tell us exactly how it all goes down on
Election night so in other words a
basically a witness or whistleblower
reward for somebody who tells us you
know how they cheated now I would like
to upgrade that um if if such an reward
is going to be offered it's really
really important that it happens before
the election in other words it would be
good if let's say after the election if
somebody said hey we'll give you a
million dollars if you can prove that
there was some bad behavior but you know
what would be way better than that you
say it before anybody has time to cheat
you say we're going to pay your your
accomplice a million dollars to turn you
in now what do you do how would you like
to work with a couple of accomplice to
cheat on an election and then you find
out that the person you're sitting next
to your accomplice can either accept
$10,000 for the cheating they're doing
I'm just making up numbers now so they
can either take $10,000
plus you know the satisfaction of
winning I suppose or or the person next
to him can make one phone call and make
a million
dollars all they have to do is turn in
their friend and maybe they don't don't
know that person that well anyway maybe
they just think the world would be
better if they got paid a million
dollars and our elections were more
secure so I think you need to make that
a big deal before the election because
you want everybody who might be in ined
to cheat and might be inclined to have
somebody working with them to cheat I
want them not to trust their their
co-conspirators you you want to create
complete chaos among the cheaters before
the
election if in fact there is any
cheating now you should also offer the
reward if you find that somebody's
planning to cheat so it shouldn't just
be that they did cheat I would like to
know that for example there's a already
a warehouse full of ballots that are
fake I'd give a million dollars for that
that sounds like something worth a
million
dollars and I would think that the Trump
campaign should be able to afford a
million doll or a few million dollar
Bounty because uh in terms of the
publicity you would get for that and the
bang for the buck that would be the best
million dollars the campaign ever spent
just put on a reward
anyway still talking about Iran getting
ready to attack unless they've attacked
in the last hour then the US secary of
defense is told the USS Abraham Lincoln
to accelerate its its travel to the
Middle East so we're building up our
resources over there so we'll see what
happens uh I continue to say that Iran
is kind of trapped on this they they
can't do nothing but if they do anything
that's even a little bit effective they
just give Israel a free pass to do God
knows what so there's no winning play
here for Iran so will they do something
that looks like a play but isn't a play
so I think they're going to have to do
something that looks like it's
big uh looks like it's big but isn't I
don't know if you can find that
space uh over at Ukraine I guess Putin
is saying that the latest attacks by
Ukraine on the uh Russian territory are
just a uh trying to improve negotiating
position Now That's What I Said So
apparently Putin agrees with me that
it's not Ukraine trying to win the war
they're just trying to grab some Russian
territory so they have something to
trade back so if they can grab some
Russian territory that's lightly
defended that's going to be a whole lot
easier than getting Crimea that would be
heavily
defended so that's happening then the
other thing that's happening is as you
know Ukraine has a massive Manpower and
woman power shortage for the fighters so
if Russia just keeps doing what it's
doing with its larger population it can
just grind down the the ukrainians until
they literally don't have any fighting
age men or even women left to put on a
uniform so what would happen then well
isn't it weird that this is the exact
time that uh robot fighting dogs have
been invented so there's actually talk
about uh introducing one of those robot
fighting dogs fairly
soon to assist the
ukrainians I think Ukraine if it goes
for more than a year you know I do think
there's a good chance that Trump gets
elected and winds it up in six months
that's possible but let's say it goes
for another
year in another year the Manpower
shortage will be
critical and I think we're just going to
be building robots and just saying okay
about one person with 10 robots and the
robots are somewhat autonomous and they
just send a send a herd of of uh robot
dogs against the Enemy at the same time
AI driven um drones fly over and it's
basically one guy so one guy goes out
there with his you know his electronic
and says all right robot dogs uh here's
the GPS coordinate shoot everything you
that moves uh within this coordinate
boom robot dogs you know start their
attack all right robot dogs under effect
now drone swarm uh follow the robot dogs
and create a death from the sky when the
robot dogs are approaching so that they
have to look in two different directions
swarm boom one
button all the Swarm needs
is the
GPS data you just got to tell it where
and then even if they get
jammed uh they can switch into Ai and
the AI will just look down and say I
recognize this place my GPS is gone but
I'll just look down okay that road is
Highway whatever I'll just follow that
there we
are I think you're at the point where
one soldier can send a
swarm that's probably a year away
and that ladies and gentlemen is the end
of my prepared comments
and um I think today's is going to be
amazing
so we're all going to be entertained for
sure oh and I guess tonight is uh Elon
Musk is talking to Trump uh on a spaces
event or is it video is it video it's
probably video I think it's
video and it will be on x it will be at
uh I believe uh 8:00 p.m. eastern time
if I have that right
and um I don't think I'm going to you
know be watching it live stream I might
be watching it privately but uh that
will be interesting now there is some
conversation about whether Trump is or
has already come back to the
xplatform uh I don't think that's real
or
confirmed but if I were Trump here's how
I would do
it I would wait for Elon to ask
me during the
event if Trump has the uh legal and
financial ability to do it which I don't
think he does so I think the reason that
Trump is staying off is that he has
fiduciary and
financial um and
contractual obligations to truth social
and if he went to a you suddenly truth
wouldn't have a reason to
exist so he might also offer to sell it
to Elon imagine a conversation this way
uh Mr Trump thanks for joining me on X
uh my first question is when are you
coming back to
X then imagine this I'm just making this
up this is just fantasy then imagine
Trump saying well you know um I've
created truth social and it's worth
billions
doll and uh you know it's got a very
large audience very dedicated and uh
contractually and financially I'm you
know I have to stay there it's what's
good for the investors it's what's good
for the users over there and I have a
commitment to
them
but if you wanted to buy
it we could wrap that up pretty
quickly so wouldn't that be interesting
conversation and then imagine Elon
saying how
much and then imagine Trump saying well
I have a
price imagine if he came with a price
say all right it's $6
billion and then Elon would say for how
many users and then Trump would tell him
and he'd say that's way too expensive
for that many
users how about 3
billion and Trump would say well have to
talk to people but we might be able to
make that
work none of that's going to happen n
none of that's going to happen but you
have two individuals who are not like
any other
people so you also can't predict what
will happen I think there's a at least a
40% chance it will be a nothing meaning
that Trump will say what Trump always
says musk will ask good questions you
know he'll ask good questions but maybe
Trump's just in Camp aign mode and and
he's just generically Trump and that
wouldn't be the biggest story in the
world be interesting it wouldn't be the
biggest story but you've got two people
who can't help but make
news you've got two people who have no
barriers No
Limits nothing financially stopping him
from doing
anything what could
happen it could be the most interesting
thing now the other thing to look for is
I guess um musk had said that he had
offered to Trump
that if Trump created a government
efficiency committee or working task
force or something that he would be part
of it just to figure out how to make the
government you know a smaller tighter
more efficient thing like he did with
X so it's definitely going to be
interesting um but anything could happen
so make sure you don't miss it all right
that's it for my regular show I'm going
to go privately over to locals some
people on locals say that they lose the
sound on locals when I go private so if
you do lose the sound could you tell me
in the comments if that happens to
you and I'll see the rest of you
tomorrow thanks for
joining this is just the local
subscribers
