let me tell you an inspirational message
from a republican
we're going to solve climate change
and i don't even care if it's real
because we need the energy and we need
it to be clean and i'm going to make
nuclear my focus
i'm going to get rid of the regulations
that are blocking the new builds
just embrace their topic
just say look
you guys you made you made your sale
we're going to go serious with green
energy
but we're not going to do it the stupid
way
we're going to do it the smart way
because even elon musk says you're not
going to get away with
getting rid of nuclear so i'm going to
agree with the smartest guy in the world
musk about energy probably
we're going to do we're going to go
crazy on the thing that's green energy
the best one
and we're going to solve your climate
change for you
even if you don't believe it's real
because i'm going to give you so much
cheap energy that's clean
that if climate change isn't a problem
you'll forget you ever worried about it
you're just going to be glad you had
your cheap energy
i will make you forget that climate
change was a problem
because whether your problem is you
don't have enough energy
or your problem is that you're you know
putting too much co2 in the air i'll
solve both of those problems and i don't
even care if one of them wasn't real
you can argue all day whether whether
climate change is going to destroy us in
80 years i'm going to make sure it's not
an option
i don't know if climate change is real
i'm no scientist i'm going to make sure
there's no risk though
because there's smart people who say it
is a risk
so i'm going to make sure there is no
risk and i'm going to do it for free
and what i mean by free
is i'm going to do what you wanted me to
do anyway which is give you lots of
reliable clean energy
it's also going to solve your climate
change problem and if you democrats
think that the climate change was a hoax
keep thinking it it doesn't matter the
problem is going to go away either way
i'm going to solve your problem even if
it isn't real i'll solve real problems
i'll solve them imaginary problems you
send me a problem and i'm going to work
on solving it and i'm going to let you
work on whether i'm an
how about you guys think about that
go back to your rooms if you don't want
to be part of the useful solutions if
you don't want a system that works if
you don't want a world that works why
don't you go back to your rooms and then
think about how big of an i am
because that's all you're good
for
if you're not going to help
go back and complain to each other about
how we're all nazi
while we're trying to save your
children's lives
all right i'll be working on that
you work on what a bad character i have
and that thing i tweeted once all right
you go work on that
prove to the country they have no
 value
while i'm working on saving the country
right now you tell me
that republicans can't win everything
how hard would it be
they would just have to not be stupid
somebody on locals is saying that what i
just said was brilliant it's not that my
whole point is that it's easy
it's not brilliant
you just have to do what clinton did
brilliantly
which is accept the other person's
argument and then top it
rejecting the other person's argument
just keeps them over there fighting with
you
you have to embrace their argument and
then top it
that's what i did with climate change i
embraced it
and that i gave you a better solution
than they were giving you for the for
the problem that you don't even think is
a problem in some cases
by the way i think climate change is
real
and i think it doesn't matter
because everything you need to do you
need to do anyway we need some clean
reliable energy there's only one way to
get it
two ways if you say solar is part of the
answer and i think it is
i think it is
