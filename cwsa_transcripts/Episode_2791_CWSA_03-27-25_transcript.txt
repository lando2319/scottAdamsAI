Tesla's up a little bit today it was
down yesterday well we'll keep an eye on
that but meanwhile let's get your
comments working
hey
no well it's working in a
moment come on app do your
thing I guess it's not going to do its
thing there it
is all right we're all good
[Music]
now good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take your experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a CER mug or a
glass of tanker Chels a Stein a can jug
or flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopam of the day the thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens
now
siastic better than
normal well let's check the uh science
news to see if there's anything I can
Doge and by that I mean save them some
money oh oh yes let's see the University
of South
Australia um has determined that
exercise of any kind can boost the brain
power of people at any age huh how could
they have come up with that data without
spending all the money is there anything
they could have done that would save
them all that time and effort yes you
could just ask Scott next time Scott is
exercise good for your brain well
according to every single study that's
ever been done on the topic
yes we were thinking of doing a study on
the topic you don't have to you don't
have to it's been studied and studied
and it's also really obvious you can
tell by observing people and also in
yourself I don't know we we kind of want
to do a study on this do you have grant
money
yes well maybe Doge should cut that
grant money even though you're in
Australia that's how good doge is it's
going to cut things in
Australia well speaking of things
related to Elon Musk according to f.org
um the
xplatform sales or the advertising
revenue is growing I'm not sure if they
really know that but they say it's
growing and uh the the reason behind the
growth in advertising on X according to
this publication uh is being driven by
fear do you do you think they would
cover anybody else's business this
way as if they know why people are doing
it so why are you advertising on X is it
because it's a really good value for the
dollar
or or is it because we imagine that
you're afraid oh now that musk is
friends with Trump oh we' better
advertise so we can we can bribe him
with money because that works right you
know bribing him with money no it
doesn't work but anyway good to see that
the ad sales are are
up
um now I promised you if you're on a I
made the promise that I would do some
remote viewing today and it's because
there's a document that's been found
it's an older document but back in
1988 the CIA claimed to have confirmed
the existence of the Ark of the Covenant
and the way they did that was they used
a remote viewer now that would be a
person who has uh psychic powers where
if they close their eyes they can view
things across the world or even across
the Galaxy because time and space don't
matter and uh so apparently some remote
viewer um I did identify the Arc of the
Covenant uh over in the Middle East and
said it was a in a coffin-shaped ornate
box uh couldn't be more specific than
that somewhere in the Middle East and it
was being guarded by
entities but I feel like that's the sort
of thing you shouldn't just trust right
you know one remote viewer is one remote
if you were a good source no you need
two you need a second source so I
thought i' do a little remote viewing
for you if you don't
mind
preparing hold on be silent for a
moment
um I'm getting something uh it's it's
ornate it's the size of a coffin it's in
a hole it's um I'm sorry that was yeah
that that was uh yeah no that wasn't it
that was just somebody's uh casket hold
let me
go Ark of the Covenant where are you got
it got it there it is it's an an ornate
box it's buried somewhere in the Middle
East I can't be more
specific I believe there's sand around
and it's being guarded
by four entities four enti entities
regarding it uh I think one of them his
name is
Bob uh there's Carl The Entity
and somebody whose nickname is bit Bop
that's weird and uh Alex Alex so the
four entities guarding the Ark of the
Covenant confirmed
confirmed now that probably will be
national news by the end of the day
because you know if you only have one
remote viewer seeing the Arc of the
Covenant that means
nothing but if you have two that's
confirmation yeah that's
confirmation so we got that going for us
meanwhile according to Reuters the
Supreme Court said it will not hear a uh
youth Le climate change case so the
Supreme Court said get out of here we
don't want to hear your TW 21 young
people's case that the government and
their energy policies have violated your
right to be protected from climate
change you know your right to be
protected from climate change have you
even read the Constitution people it's
right there it's uh I believe it's
article of the
Constitution it's uh it's one of those
uh amendments or something I'm pretty
sure it's in there
right no okay maybe it's not in
there meanwhile there's a private Texas
school that claims that by using an AI
program an AI tutor that its students
have to the top 2% in the country uh Fox
News is reporting on this and the
co-founder of the school it's called
Alpha School says the students are
learning better and faster and they only
spend a few hours a day talking to the
AI and then they're done with all their
work and they don't even need to do
homework because they're learning so
fast and uh then they spend the rest of
the day doing passion projects yeah
passion projects now I don't know
exactly what that means but it sounds
pretty good so you do way less
work and you get way more
fun and you get way better
grades now the alpha School is uh
looking to expand um so it's got a few
hundred students now but it's going to
expand across the United States H so
that would sort of suggest it's a
for-profit
school right I mean I don't see anything
that says it's
a government funded or anything so it's
a for-profit entity that's telling us
that their product works better than
other people's product well if you can't
trust that what can you
trust um now as others have pointed out
if it's a private
school and it's a
for-profit there's probably a little
healthy tuition going on there and I
would expect that it would only attract
the best
students now let me ask you
this if you put a a top student in front
of an AI that's really good at you know
quiz them could they get done with all
their necessary work in a few hours i'
say yes probably yes if you take an
average student or a not so good student
and say sit here alone with this AI
until you're homework's done in three
hours how's that going to
go I don't think that's going to work at
all so once again I think we're going to
learn that the people who have all the
advantages and this case it would be the
rich smart people probably can get like
a huge Advantage from using AI as part
of their process but I'm not so sure
that AI is going to work for every kind
of student it might only work for the
top students and then everybody else has
to figure it out we'll see but uh I have
some questions about
that well Tom homman gets another win I
guess they Capt capured one of the top
three MS13 leaders in the United
States um and this was a
24-year-old so he was one of the top
three MS13 leaders in the country he was
running the entire East Coast operations
now the first thing that jumped out of
me about this story is wow good work Tom
homman capturing a top leader of MS13
the second thing that jumped out was
he's only 24
wow you know the one thing about MS13
they don't tell you is what a great
Economic Opportunity is because there
are not many there just not that many
jobs where you could be leading a major
organization at the age of 24 so good
for you MS13 they are not discriminating
against young people plenty of
opportunity so I'd recommend it as a
good career path for all of you no I'm
just kidding it's terrible career paths
don't join
MS13 meanwhile Zero Hedge is reporting
that um there was this gigantic $250
million fraud involving a Child
Nutrition program Federal Child
Nutrition program and a whole bunch of
Somali uh immigrants stole $250 million
in Minnesota now that was between March
2020 and January
2022 now now how many times have we
heard a story about gigantic amounts of
money being
stolen I'm starting to you know lose
sort of the distinction between all the
stories but it does feel to me like
quite a few billions of dollars are
being stolen
from
taxpayers
and it's like the government never heard
of anything like a ating or
accounting or tracking your
progress how in the world did they get
away with $250 million of essentially
faking that there were children that
didn't
exist how in the world two years $250
million the what if there are just like
dozens or hundreds of these happening
all over the country you know in
different ways different people and
stuff I feel like that might be the
case well
um see what else is going
on according to uh Liberty Nation
news the Associated
Press um has a
uh has a reporter who got caught doing
some fake news and they had to retract
it and the fake news was that a claim
that uh tulsey gabard had said that
Trump and Putin were good
friends but it turns out she was talking
about Prime Minister Modi and Trump who
are actually good friends and so the
Associated Press had to you know correct
their story because it was wrong but the
fun part of the story is that the
reporter who wrote it um his one of his
prior jobs
one of his prior jobs was uh uh he was
part of the ap's first misinformation
beat Team focusing on explaining
falsehoods propaganda and conspiracy
theories while exposing the creators of
this material and their techniques for
dissemination how many times have the
fake news
people uh got onto the um hey we'll
check the fake news to the other
people sometimes it's exactly what you'd
expect you know I have this theory that
that shoe salesmen if it's men who are
selling shoes to women um that
eventually it will be men only men who
have foot fetishes because they would be
most drawn to the field and they would
work longer hours cheaper because they
were getting you know an extra benefit
from it and and it just seems to me that
the the organizations that are uh trying
to fact check other
organizations probably they're filled
with fake news people because it just
feel like that's what would be drawn to
those jobs oh so I can just call other
people fake news yeah that would be your
job all right I'm
in well Trump is saying uh on true
social it's time to defund NPR and and
PBS immediately he says that uh they're
both horrible and they're completely
biased platforms and uh they should be
defunded by Congress
immediately he says Republicans don't
miss this opportunity to rid our country
of this giant scam both being arms of
the radical left Democrat Party just say
no and make America great again well
related to this story um the uh the NPR
CEO her name is
marah last name is mAh and she was been
grilled by this guy uh Brandon Gil so
Gil was doing some grilling he's Grill
and Gil and if you haven't seen the
videos of it it's highly
recommended because of the attitude that
he brought to
it so he he'd asked a question like uh
do you recall saying this this or that
and it' be some terrible woke thing that
would sound so bad in 2025 but you know
maybe at some point it didn't sound so
bad and then uh Mara would say um I
never said that and then representative
Gil would say uh yes you did here's a
tweet of yours from 2020 and then he
would read the Tweet where she said
exactly that and then she'd say well I
don't remember that
or uh I've completely evolved in my
thinking so I definitely don't think
that now now if you only saw it happen
once with let's say one claim or one
tweet it wouldn't be much you know
because people say crazy stuff I say
crazy things you could almost certainly
find something in my tweeting history
that if you if you read it to me in a
congressional setting and said do you
really believe this
I might say you know maybe I thought it
at the time but you know not really not
now but if you have a lot of
them it becomes quite a show and and
apparently she had quite a few things to
say almost every one of them would have
been disqualifying for any kind of
leadership job and she had to respond to
everyone that she had completely changed
her views from crazy woke to something
more like you know a leader perspective
oh my god did she get destroyed Brandon
Gil good job there
[Music]
Brandon all right some of you have
already seen this story but I just had
to weigh in um I guess on Joe Rogan show
he had a doctor Dr Suzanne humph and
they were talking about the real story
of
polio now before I tell you what you
know what the claim is uh let me say
that I don't know how to judge this
there was a time when if I had read if I
had heard there somebody saying that the
polio vaccine actually doesn't do
anything and the polio uh well the CLA
let me tell you the claim the claim is
that the polio vaccine didn't stop any
polio at
all what did stop polio is nothing
nothing stopped it at
all and that all they did was redefine
certain conditions as no longer being
polio so they came up with new names for
stuff so then when somebody had
something that used to be called polio
but they had been vaccinated the doctor
would say well I can't be
polio because you've been vaccinated so
it looks like you got this uh Gillian
bar thing or you've got this
cocki virus or an echo
virus I don't know what a suaki
virus is but that sounds like a bad
one what kind of virus did you get I got
that sucky
virus it's spelled CX s a c k IE virus
all one word it just sounds like a
saki virus which is absolutely the worst
gun you could get
or or the doctors would chalk it up to
now this is the claim of Dr Suzanne
humph these are not my claims um lead
poisoning or mercury poisoning so they'd
always they'd always have some answer to
it and then the doctor says the rise of
polio or what seemed to be the rise of
polio was directly mirror the use of
toxic pesticides like
DDT she says and she says the countries
that still make DDT today is where we're
still seeing the polio
happen
so let me say what I think a number of
other others of you have said or are
thinking right now let me see if I can
read your mind all right I'm going to
read your mind I've already done remote
viewing uh reading your mind and you're
saying got it got it what you're saying
is there was a time you would not have
believed this story
right this is not that
time that this is a time where I look at
this I mean this is a really Fantastical
claim that the entire medical community
didn't know that that polio
either was just not what they thought it
was and the vaccine didn't make any
difference at
all Ah that's quite a claim quite a
claim but in
2025 to you know steal a joke from Joe
Rogan um I'm not so sure the moon
landing was real and by the way I'm not
so sure the moon landing was real like
I've actually I've actually been
flipped even maybe a month ago I I was
holding tough it's like come on of
course the moon landing's real I mean
you can see the assets up there you can
you know people can still see that the
know some of the assets are down there
on the moon surface how could it not be
real and then I thought well maybe the
pictures aren't real I mean maybe they
landed something on the moon but are the
pictures real maybe they couldn't get
good film on the moon or get it quickly
so maybe they filmed it separately even
if they did land on the moon either with
a person or without
people so at the moment
I'm completely open to 100% of
everything I've learned in history being
fake that doesn't mean it is but I'm
completely open to it now there there's
nothing I'm unwilling to believe no
matter how crazy and I'm going to put
this on that list I'm not going to say
this is true because I how would I know
but is it possible within the realm of
possibility that polio could have been
completely a
fake hysteria and the answer is I hate
to say
it but it's a little bit
possible it's just a little bit
possible I don't think it's the most
likely
explanation uh to be honest if I had to
place a
bet I would bet that the vaccinations
work and polio is
real but man it's not 100% is it you
know I'd love to tell you I'm super
confident about that but nope nope it's
a little bit closer to a coin flip
little bit closer to a coin
flip I I I see your comments and I'm
just chuckling to myself one one of you
is trying to get me kicked off of all
social media platforms forever I'm not
going to take the
bait well according to cash Patel Trum
Trump Has This brilliant plan where he's
uh he either has or is going to file a
lawsuit against all the people involved
in the Russia collusion
hoax now it would be a lawsuit as
opposed to a criminal action and he
would be suing for you know Financial um
compensation now the financial part
probably doesn't matter to him that much
but it's a RICO lawsuit I didn't know
you could Rico in a lawsuit but maybe
it's the essence of Rico as opposed to
Rico and what uh cash Patel is pointing
out
um is that it could lead to the
possibility of criminal charges so in
other words if the lawsuit had some
Discovery involved or some uh let's say
it tied together a bunch of things that
nobody tied together before it could
create the basis for a criminal
prosecution on the same the same grounds
that it was
organized
funded and it was an operation that
involved a vast number of people from uh
lawyers and a certain firm to Hillary
Clinton's campaign to the FBI to the
Department of Justice I don't know who
else the the media maybe the media so
um and then as cash Patel points out I
guess he was talking to Charlie Kirk on
the podcast um that the Rico part of it
the part where everything's connected
and it's not one person who just did a
thing it's a whole bunch of people who
apparently know knew what the other
people were doing and seemed to be
coordinated uh he says that the the
Durham report and other I guess legal
actions have uh essentially Prov proven
the main points that the lawsuit would
try to establish which is it was fake we
know who the people involved were and we
know pretty much that they communicated
but maybe that's the extra stuff they
have to add to it to you know give some
testimonies and stuff like that so that
is really interesting as a legal
strategy and I I'm all in for that
we should absolutely know if our
government was real or we were just run
by a bunch of hoaxes and Rico and and
some deep State stuff I don't
know well in other news uh
representative Thomas messie he's
introducing a bill uh the Dual loyalty
disclosure act so if somebody is a
candidate for office for federal office
this is uh they would have to disclose
all the countries in which they are
citizens now you're probably saying to
yourself that seems unnecessary because
everybody knows who's a dual citizen
right I mean it would be easy to check
and if somebody had dual citizenship and
they were in Congress you'd know about
it
right apparently there's no reporting
requirement and there's no place you can
look it
up so we can have we could have thousand
of people in Congress who who are
actually citizens of other countries at
the same time they're citizens of the
United States and we wouldn't even know
it now I know what you're going to say
Israel right say it you know that's what
you want to say you want to say there
are members of Congress who are who are
secretly also dual citizens of Israel
well according to my limited research
there's no known case of
that so if you have different
information than I do let me know but to
the best of my you know very quick
analysis there's no there's no example
of that there doesn't seem to be as far
as anybody knows any member of Congress
who's a dual
citizen now that that actually surprised
me I thought there'd be one or
two um and I don't think there's anybody
else who hasn't at this point um
renounced their dual citizenship so
there were a few that were not related
to Israel um where people were
challenged I think Ted Cruz was one Ted
Cruz had Canadian citizenship as as well
American and I believe he renounced the
Canadian part as soon as it became an
issue and I think there were a few other
candidates or a few other politicians
were in the same situation they weren't
really you know w weren Really wed to
the other country so they just renounced
it and fixed it but uh I guess I I
approve of this I don't think it'll make
much difference in the real world but be
good to
know all right let's talk about signal
gate believe it or not I think I can add
something to the story it's a boring
story and that's the the biggest part of
the story is that it's too boring for
the public to get interested in
imagine if you didn't follow the news
like we do like
obsessively trying to figure stuff out
all day long and and you heard about oh
they use the signal app like you
wouldn't even know like why is that bad
or anything like
that so here's something that uh CI CIA
director Ratcliffe said in a statement
and he was dumping on the reporter who
wrote about it Jeffrey Goldberg he's the
one who was added to the signal group um
we don't know exactly how he was added
yet but it wasn't by
Ratliff and anyway so CIA director reff
said yesterday I spent four hours
answering questions from Senators as a
result of that article intimating that I
transmitted classified information now I
didn't know that I didn't know that
Goldberg suggested that maybe Ratcliffe
had transmitted and classified
information because we didn't see any
example that so I didn't know that was
being even suggested and then um reff
says those messages were revealed today
I did not transmit classified
information I guess we can now just look
at the messages and see he's right he
said the reporter Goldberg who I don't
know intentionally in intended uh it to
indicate that the reporter also
indicated I released the name of an
undercover CIA operative in fact I
released the name of my own Chief of
Staff who is not operating undercover uh
and that was deliberately false and
misleading okay that's pretty bad that's
pretty imagine being accused you're the
head of the CIA imagine being accused of
releasing the name of an undercover CIA
agent and then finding out literally
nothing like that happened it was just
made up
apparently but I want to redo this last
sentence and see if this sounds familiar
to you so Ras summary sentence was the
mission was a remarkable success because
that's what did happen not what could
have
happened not what could have
happened have you noticed the
pattern the pattern that
Democrats have imaginary
concerns yeah we'll talk about that in a
little
bit um but I wrote a uh post on a that I
thought captured some of the uh some of
the Nuance that nobody had captured yet
on this signal
thing uh so starting with if Heth and I
believe this is true uh secretary Heth
he has the power to declassify
content so all he has to do is say
declassify this and it's
Declassified so in my opinion putting
that content on Signal which is what he
did is a de facto
declassification now it's the same thing
I said about Trump and marago if the
person who's in charge of saying
something is classified or not
intentionally puts it in a place that
they know is not
classified that's a de facto practical
declassification now it should be with
paperwork but is that the problem are we
mad at heg cuz he didn't do
paperwork that that wouldn't make
anybody mad would it if he intended it
to be um in a non-classified setting and
obviously he knew this signal was not
their top secret
setting so he very consciously put it
into a less than completely secure
setting I would call that a de facto
declassification now here's the thing
that um
you'll see in the news over and over
again and I think I'm about the only
person besides Greg geld whoever calls
this out which is I call it the half
pinion if the only thing you knew about
the story is that somebody took some
information that you think should be in
the most
maximized um secret setting and they
moved it to a less secret
setting how would you judge that and and
and there could be potential you know
military implications to it how would
you judge that well I'd say that's a
mistake that's a pretty big one right if
all you're looking at is is the cost of
it you know what's the downside what's
the Worst That Could Happen I'd say
that's
terrible but what are we leaving
out we're leaving out why he did
it why did he put that information in
that setting well it's because he had a
mission he'd been asked to keep this
very group of people uh informed right
up to the last minute I mean the the
timing of it was important and uh it was
very important to keep them informed in
case somebody had a last minute
objection because remember this was big
stuff he was ready to kill a whole bunch
of people which presumably is what
happened when the strike happened so
before he decided to unle leash death
death like people dying he wanted to
make sure that the people most
involved got their final say and I don't
think that that was just you know
checking a box to me that seems
important that that if you've been asked
to keep this group informed it's because
this group might be the ones who say you
know what hold on hold on you know I I
have such an objection or I found found
something new or maybe there's something
we haven't considered maybe they would
have delayed it and that could have been
really
important right so if you were to judge
it as did he take something into a less
secure platform yes by itself that would
look like a mistake but if you judge it
by what was he trying to accomplish
which was to make sure that the people
most important to the decision were
still okay with the decision before he
killed people
before he killed
people that seems pretty legitimate to
me now let me tell you something about
every big organization I've ever been
involved with if you followed all of the
rules of any big organization be it a
corporation or anywhere else you would
immediately bring that Corporation or
organization to his knees because big
organizations have enough rules that you
wouldn't be able to get anything done
let me give you an example one of my
first jobs out of college I was a bank
teller and I one day I cashed a bad
check and it's because I didn't check uh
identification properly now the reason I
didn't check is because the person who
brought the people with a check in and
stood right there at the window with
them was a friend of
mine so the friend says well you know I
can vouch for these two they're friends
of mine I thought oh that's safe enough
I mean this is my personal
friend turns out they were
criminals so I mean I just got scammed
so I didn't get fired because it was
sort of a first offense and it wasn't
that much
money but I did get a talking to I got a
Stern talking to and the stern talking
to was you don't get to decide which of
the rules you follow and which ones you
don't follow you will follow all the
rules and I looked at my supervisor and
I said you got it and within two hours
the line at the uh for the tellers was
out the door and I was serving very few
people because almost every encounter
required me to call my supervisor over
because that was the rule if there was
anything that was above my pay grade to
approve I couldn't do it so I brought
the entire Bank to a standstill I
crashed the bank it it couldn't do
anything for customers and they were
just lying out the door and what was I
doing I was just following all the rules
I was doing it quickly I wasn't I wasn't
uh I wasn't dragging my feet I was just
following their own rules and and one
time I called my supervisor over and
there's some guy who works for Chevron
and and he didn't have ID or he didn't
have a I guess he didn't have an account
at our Branch or something and uh she
comes over and she takes one look at him
she goes approved I go hold on hold on
what did you do that I couldn't do like
you just looked at him you literally
just looked at him that like why
couldn't I do that she goes well I
noticed he was wearing this lapel pin
that tells me that he's worked for
Chevron for I don't know at least 10
years or something and he goes and she
goes yeah nobody nobody would know to
where we that little pin if there were a
crook and I thought well I'm pretty sure
that's not in the
rules the LEL pin trick
so so this this is a pattern that you'll
see everywhere now do you think this is
different in the in the military do you
think the
military could possibly function if
everybody followed all the rules all the
time I doubt it if it's like every other
big organization no it's probably a
whole bunch of people who are
continuously looking for some way to get
around the rules and regulation just to
get something done that's probably the
most normal situation in the world so
now you've got the Pete Heth who's given
this job your job is to keep this group
of people informed right up to date like
not not once a month but like right up
to the operational Point how is he going
to do that
how you you tell me the other way he was
going to do it there wasn't another way
he was going to do it there was no other
mechanism the government does not have a
secure chat group and if it did it would
require those same people what a dozen
or 16 or whatever to all be sitting in
an office at the same time do you think
that ever happens no it never happens so
he did not have any tool any process any
way to do the thing that he had been
tasked to do that was important enough
that it could save the lives of those
people who ended up being
killed it was life and death and it was
his job it was life and death and it was
his job to keep them informed there was
no other way to do
it so what did he do I can't read his
mind but what it looks like is he said
this is not ideal just again I'm just
guessing this is not ideal to put this
on on
signal but it's only two hours between
now and the time of the attack and it's
important that we've got everybody on
board I mean that's just critically
important so he took a little bit of a
risk like everybody does and every big
organization if they're trying to work
within the rules and he got a little bit
of a benefit which is he did what he was
asked to do before he killed people
before he killed people I mean I feel
like we're forgetting we've somehow
forgotten the humanity of it this was
life and
death and you do want to make sure
everybody's on the right page before the
missiles fly so telling them exactly
when the thing was going to happen is
very critical completely appropriate to
do do you have a final
objection very important because if
there's two hours you maybe you say no
if it were a day maybe you'd say yes now
here's the question you're wondering how
how just what was the risk level of
putting something on a
signal well here's your rather
realworld um
reveal I don't believe the hoodies have
a
sophisticated hack
operation do you do you think the
hoodies had penetrated the phones of the
United States government do you think
the hoodies had a back door to the
signal I'm going to say no but before
you say it I know what you're thinking
you're thinking Scott it doesn't have to
be the hoodies it could have been the
Russians and then they tipped them off
could have been China and then they
tipped off the hoodies could have been a
ram Iran has sophisticated hackers could
have been a ram and then they would you
know ran is on their side so they tip
off the hoodies but let me give you a
little real
world
context if any of those major Powers had
access to signal and they had penetrated
it so that they could listen to our
government talking about
everything they would have risked losing
that
access by tipping off the hoodies cuz we
probably would have noticed if the
hoodies in two hours kind of quickly
adjusted their defensive
positions because you know we'd be
watching them by then right we'd have
the satellites on we'd have the drones
flying over and if suddenly two hours
before the attack everything changed and
they started rapidly moving their assets
how long would it take us to figure out
it was because of the signal jet about
five minutes and then we would have
stopped using signal and then the
Chinese or the Russians or the Iranians
would have lost their
access I think that if they had access
to that tool and they were listening to
our government conversations at the
highest
level I'm pretty sure they would have
said well we're going to let the hoodies
take the hit it would have been smarter
certainly for China and Russia no doubt
about it to let the hoodies take the hit
even even if they thought they'd like to
screw the United States
they wouldn't lose their own access to
something that important now what about
Iran I would go so far as to say that
even Iran would let the hoodies take a
hit before they would give up a source
that important now who else told you
that nobody
right so yeah once you see how weak the
analysis was of this whole situation
it's uh it's shocking
um the next thing is that uh Democrats
have you know conflated what could have
happened with what did happen now that's
what
um that's what uh Ratliff said he said
the exact same thing right so in my post
um I point out that the uh the Democrats
they love the imaginary stuff well it
could have been bad do you know what
else could have been
bad everything that those people did
that day everything how many how many
conversations did all the people who
were in that chat how many conversations
did they have on other topics with other
people that could have been could have
been
compromised but weren't probably not but
could have
been I if you're worrying about things
that could go wrong that's pretty much
everything and it's pretty much all the
time that is not a valid concern if
somebody takes a risk reward decision I
need to keep people informed that's my
job it's it's life or death it's a
little bit less secure but it's only two
hours before the strike it's pretty
unlikely that you know any notice is
going to get to them in two
hours so life is just one decision after
another but if you were to read the news
it would look like half pinions you know
a real opinion is you take the positive
and the negative risks of everything you
do okay it could go this way but it
could go that way you know get some
benefits but there might be a
cost but if the only thing you do is
look at there might be a cost you
wouldn't do
anything there well there might be a
cost um I'd like you to uh uh meet me
tomorrow at this building and we'll have
the meeting I don't know what what if I
get hit by a car in the way of the
meeting well that's certainly more of a
risk if you're traveling than if you're
staying home so was that worth the
risk everything has a risk to it
everything if you look at the fact that
everything has a risk including every
single conversation that every one of
those people had about every topic that
was you know classified all day long
it's just nothing but that risk just all
day long well somebody might have heard
it somebody might have be bugging this
room somebody somebody might be a mole
you know that's a
universal anyway
um so here's the second question people
have been asking me hey was this whole
signal thing some kind of an OP was it a
setup from the start my first impression
was uh um well I don't see how it would
be my current impression is yeah it
looks like
it I I'm not at the point where I'm
willing to say it was an OP but it looks
like it so here's here's what we
know this is according to a x account
called the
researcher um so something called
American
oversight so that this is another one of
those you know how the NOS all have
these generic names and when you hear
one of these generic names it's some
damn Democrat
op so American oversight is suing Heth
gabard and rackliff Etc uh saying that
they messaging on Signal is a violation
of the federal records act huh who do
you think is on this American oversight
group well apparently it's David Brock
and Norm
Eisen remember I tell you that if you
know what happened you don't know
anything you have to know who if the
only thing you knew was that they were
getting sued over a federal records act
you might say to yourself oh well I
guess I guess somebody in the government
takes that pretty
seriously but it's not that it's the
most devious weasel likee despicable
lying pieces of that you've ever
seen in your life Norm Eisen and David
Brock now if you don't know about those
two guys do a little
research that they are not associated
with good acts whatsoever they are
associated with the the darkest weasly
just terrible terrible
activities and so sure enough they're
behind that and they seem to be ready to
ready to go pretty quickly
surprisingly and then um they used to
have a I guess a subgroup of this
American oversight called crew
crw and according to the researcher that
was the lawfare arm or their effort to
Target Trump originally so there was a a
subset of people probably lawyer like
like people who would do the lawfare
going after Trump now why is that
important well there was a member of
that
group uh named Alex
Wong
who is being
accused of being the staffer for
Ratcliffe who added the journalist who
added Jeffrey
Goldberg
so and then on top of that uh the judge
who's been selected for this who is
randomly selected totally randomly is uh
somebody named judge bosberg have you
heard of
him again if you knew what was happening
you wouldn't know anything if you knew
who you might know everything so bosberg
he's the activist judge who is uh
blocking Trump from deporting violent
gang members he's the one who delayed
the intentionally delayed the release of
Hillary Clinton's email until after the
2016 election
he's considered an activist anti-trump
judge so pulling it all
together it does look like an OP because
none of us would really believe that uh
ratcliff's Chief of Staff if if that's
what he was Alex Wong now by the way
this is not confirmed that Alex Wong is
the person who did it that that's just
an accusation but at the moment since we
know that Ratcliffe did not have any
contact with would not have had
Goldberg's number on his own phone and
that a staffer was involved and almost
certainly was the the reason that
Goldberg got added and then you add to
it of all the people in the
world add in Goldberg was the most
dangerous thing you could do so of all
the people in the world just that one
guy gets added and of all the people in
the world uh David Brock and Norm Eisen
had a lawsuit that seemed like it was
practically ready to go and of all the
people in the world who are randomly
selected to be the judge it's this
bosberg
guy that is a lot of coincidences my
friend now again if you didn't know the
players and you didn't know that the
Alex Wong was actually part of the
organization that is now suing
them it wouldn't look like it was
necessarily a plot but as soon as you
know who the players are it just screams
it just screams like it's a yeah a RICO
plot
anyway so now that we know that the big
problem was the imaginary concern of
what could have happened but didn't
happen U I've suggested that Trump
should create a department of imaginary
concerns and it would be only to handle
Democrat complaints
and um the new Department could have
imaginary policies to combat the
imaginary concerns so you you place
things like climate change in
there um climate change at least the
crisis part of the climate change you
put the Russia collusion thing in there
you put the uh the hoodies could have
found out be by hacking uh signal in
there you put uh Trump might steal your
democracy in the imaginary concerns
Department uh that musk might steal our
social security numbers that you put
that right in the department of
imaginary concerns and that there might
be a constitutional crisis yep that's
the department of imaginary
concerns
now I don't I'm not completely serious
about this but just just think how funny
it would be if every time one of these
hoaxes comes up and Trump has asked
about it he says oh I've delegated that
to the Department of imaginary concerns
uh but but are you trying to steal our
democracy you know that's a perfectly
good question so I've delegated that to
the Department of imaginary concerns uh
uh did you agree with Putin to uh have
sex with him uh if if he stops the
fighting well you know no but I'm going
to going to assign that to the
Department of imaginary concerns and uh
we'll come up with an imaginary policy
to make sure it doesn't happen again
so uh Byron York had uh some funny
comments about
Politico so Politico had a statement in
it said there's no Administration in the
world Beyond this one where a blunder of
these
proportions by the way I've never met
any Republican who who thinks that this
blunder is of great proportion it it's
just the news telling you that you
should be concerned about it but I'm not
uh where a blunder of these proportions
happens and nobody resigns not in London
not in Moscow not in Tokyo not in
pongyang
nowhere um and then Byron New York
points out on the signal matter that uh
political Playbook makes a statement
with great confidence but maybe not much
perspective and then then he includes a
photo of the botched Afghanistan
withdrawal which uh nobody resigned over
nope one of the most embarrassing
incompetent things that ever happened in
our country a stain on our history
nobody resigned so Politico apparently
that's something we do in this
country
anyway um but apparently in this case
the dram crats in the case of the signal
gate the dram crats who are trying to
train their Their audience that they
should be very very
concerned and they do it by the emotion
that they put into ordinary words like
oh my God the the incompetence I am a
gast I'm simply shocked there's no
country in the world from Moscow toang
Yang who would ever make such a
mistake and people who have lived in the
real world say yeah well unless it was
impossible to get ordinary work done
without bending a rule or two which is a
universal
truth uh Jonathan Turley was uh talking
about Daniel Goldman representative
Goldman and he says that Goldman claimed
that the FBI investig investigating
attacks on
Tesla uh and its facilities is nothing
but lawfare and political
weaponization so Goldman
thinks that invest tigating the people
who are the terrorists is the problem
it's not the
terrorists it's that if you investigate
who the terrorists are well that's a
case of lawfare and political
weaponization right
there now uh as uh Turley says Goldman's
latest controversy captures how
Democrats have now entirely cut the CT
of decency and moderation that once
tethered their party to the mainstream
of our society I love that sentence
turle is a great writer if you just want
to see great writing you know in
addition to you know great opinions he
can put a sentence together like
nobody's business he's just a great
writer um but then he did something that
I was wondering about uh turly was
helping us with the definition of what
terrorism is and he points out that he's
long criticized the expansion of what
terroris m is and I would agree with
that I I don't think you want to
trivialize terrorism and just start
calling everything terrorism you don't
want to do that but let's see let's see
if this uh Tesla stuff fits the
definition without stretching
it so toally points out that the uh the
justice department defines domestic
Terror terrorism as quote violent
criminal acts committed by individuals
and or groups to further ideological go
s stemming from domestic influences such
as those of a political religious social
racial or environmental nature and
that's perfectly captures what's
happening to Tesla so yes um you don't
have to hurt
people to be a terrorist if you're
destroying economic assets and you're
also doing it in the um in the pursuit
of political gain that's also terrorism
because you know money is important to
people you know it it's not just
physical pain and and and death and
injury it's destroying economics because
that's that's uh its own problem anyway
um to me it seems like
uh the probably the funniest thing that
will happen this year is the Trump
Administration without even trying
getting prominent Democrats to support
domestic
terrorism how would you like to be
running against running for president in
the next election can you imagine JD
Vance running against one of these
clowns who is not who is
not um disowning the
terrorism imagine if he ran against
Goldman well uh Dan it seems to me that
you've been supporting domestic
terrorism in this country
and uh I think the voters should know
that if they vote for you they're voting
for a domestic terrorist according to
the definition of those
terms it it feels like it' be the
easiest thing in the world to be almost
any prominent Democrat at this point
they've literally supported terrorism I
think Rana and maybe one other person
have said you know right up front and
write it loudly and I respect that yeah
that the violence that's just got end
you know the the Tesla stuff nope don't
do that that's bad so but only a
few like is it even more than two at
this point in the entire Democrat Party
was it just two people who willing to
say that domestic terrorism is a bad
idea and the problem is that the
Democrats have Unleashed domestic
terrorism a number of times you know if
you count uh antifa and black lives
matter and and now this it it's
definitely a
pattern anyway if you haven't seen Ezra
Klein on Gavin nome's podcast I highly
recommend it because uh Ezra's book
abundance with Derek Thompson I guess um
is getting a lot of attention and you
know my first take on it when I just had
AI summarize it for me was wait a minute
uh all they're doing is promoting
Republican policy you know such as don't
waste the money build things build
things in this country you know be be
practical get some actual wins you know
ordinary stuff and so I wasn't that
impressed with it because it just seemed
to be telling Democrats to be
Republicans um which was funny in its
own way but the more I hear him because
I've listened he's very interesting so
the more I've listen to him on various
podcasts he's going hard at the
Democrats he he's not taking
prisoners and it's exactly what they
needed so if you're if you're asking
yourself what's the
solution I don't know if it's this but
it's something like this and so he sat
with Gavin Nome and um I I'll just give
you the top level summary it's just
worth watching and he starts describing
how Democrats operate which is getting
large funding for things and then
building nothing and he's just making
Nome
squirm and then Nome has to talk but one
of the things that Newsome does because
he's he's clever but weasle at the same
time Nome will agree with whatever your
criticism is but then he's got lots of
reasons why you know it's not as bad as
you think or everything will be fine or
you know so he's got this pattern where
he first agrees but then he he talks for
a while and then he makes his own point
which is disagreeing
basically you have to watch Nome being
triggered into fullword salad that
didn't look like it had an end he was
full Kam Harris yo well uh big word big
word um jargon uh uh big word and uh um
uh big word big word big word
and it just went on and on and he was
just dying in front of the camera and
I'm not even sure he knew it so he had
to throw in some weird hand
motions like this I don't know we don't
know why he does that but he was just
destroyed right on camera and you know
we've seen some we've seen uh you know
Bannon we've seen Charlie Kirk and stuff
talking to Gavin and they would have
their own criticisms and so you've seen
Gaffin handle criticisms and you know
give him credit he does he does interact
with people who are willing to criticize
so I'll give him credit for that but
I've never seen anybody destroy
him Ezra just destroyed him it's it's
really fun to watch you could have to
watch it anyway uh Laura lomer
apparently has a lawsuit against Bill
Maher because uh Bill Maher on his
show um inferred that she was having an
affair with Trump because I don't know
she traveled on the jet or something
and so Laura lomer is suing
him and uh apparently a judge refused to
throw it out so it's going forward and
now Bill M will have to sit and answer
questions about why he did
that um I don't know if she can win this
you know I'll defer to the
lawyers um implied not inferred okay
I'll take that he he implied it not
inferred it
um because you would have to prove that
he knew he was
lying so wouldn't A Perfect Defense be
is sure look like it to
me wouldn't that be the entire defense
or would he go with um it's a humor show
nobody should take it too seriously
you know it's it's meant for comedic
value so it's not as
serious I don't know I remember seeing
it live and saying to myself whoa that's
too
far did did anybody see it live when
Mara made that accusation or implied
it to me it looked too far because that
was definitely not in evidence and Trump
has traveled with what a thousands and
thousands of people on his plane some
male seem some
female yeah I mean to me it looked too
far and uh we'll see we'll see what
happens I don't think she can
win because I think he just has to say
his State of Mind was that he believed
it was true I think that's all it takes
but I don't
know um meanwhile rasmuson said
Democratic approval of the party is 26%
that would be a new
I think it might drop into the
teens actually by the end of the year
it's it's possible
that Democrat approval or popularity
will be in the high
teens
now I think congress's approval
generally speaking has been in the High
Teens before so it's not
impossible and I don't think anybody
would seen it go to
26% but if it's going to 26% isn't
freefall now I know that last 20% are
going to hold tight
but I think it's just going to get worse
right you know one more day of Jasmine
Crockett should make pretty much all the
Democrats change sides at that
point meanwhile RFK Jr is uh trying to
ban big Pharma
ads um on
TV and uh I think most of you know that
the reason big Pharma advertises is not
so that they can get the patients to ask
their doctor for the drug but rather
it's so that the allegedly uh it's so
that the news entity will not say bad
things about big
Pharma so it's essentially a way to
bribe the news industry to stay away
from their stories um that's the
claim but the other thing that the big
PHA ads do and this is my my hypnotist
take on it so you haven't heard this
one if I watch a big Pharma commercial
on a news program it'll start with oh
you got this problem here's this drug
that helps it but eventually I guess for
legal reasons they have to tell you all
the side effects and man when they start
with the side effects it just kills me
if I can't find the remote to turn off
the TV I'll have to put a boot through
it because the damage that it's doing to
my brain it starts out with uh and be
careful your penis will fall off your
hair will catch on fire your throat will
close and you will be bleeding blood
from your ass for the rest of your life
you will probably get amnesia or
rheumatoid arthritis your heart will
turn into a lump of coal your blood will
coag coagulate into kind of a mayonnaise
you will be begging for life and
probably rolling around on the floor and
pain for the rest of your existence
which might not last very long and I'm
like where's the remote oh God oh God
where's the remote and I'm running
around and I'm moving the I'm moving
pillows
like because you can't have that much
negativity just drilled into your
head even
casually and it is and by the way I'm
only barely exaggerating how much impact
it has on me I can feel it I mean I just
feel it and I'm convinced that big
Pharma is destroying the um the business
model of the
news now because they're the biggest
Advertiser of course the news will say
yes but if you run this biggest
Advertiser over and over again and the
old people just keep hearing all these
horrible things that are going to happen
to them if they take this drug
eventually and this is the Hypno filter
eventually it should be like pavo's dog
except instead of giving you a treat
that will make you salvate the next time
the scientist comes in the room it
should make you if you turn on the TV
and you see news it should make you
think oh even before the commercial
like if you turn if you're just slipping
through the channels and uh Jake Tapper
comes on the first thing you might think
is my penis will fall off I'm going to
ble bleed through my ass no no no and
just flip to anything else so I think
over time big Pharma destroys the
business model of the news it
should Oh Canada uh so there's a story
post millennial has a story about their
uh conservative uh I guess the
conservative leader what's his name mark
Carney um is he prime minister now or is
he just I'm so confused about the
Canadian system but anyway so Mark
Carney apparently used to be Justin
Trudeau's
um economic
advisor while he was the economic
advisor to Justin Trudeau he went to
China and he negotiated to get a $276
million loan for his own business
so it wasn't even for the government it
was for his own business now it's not
illegal to you know have your own
business and be an economic adviser I
guess um but wouldn't you like to know
if any strings were attached to that
loan do you think China was trying to
influence
Canada I don't know that's a tough one
to explain so he's got some explaining
to do on that but wow meanwhile uh
Vladimir zalinski says that Putin is
going to die soon because he's got all
kinds of medical problems and uh that
should change everything he he literally
says he'll die soon um I believe we've
been hearing that
for five
years for how long have we been hearing
Putin's going to die any
minute
um I don't know maybe zinsky knows
something we don't but I wouldn't count
on that I don't think I'd make any
policy on it now let me tell you the
least surprising news of the day people
you you're never going to believe this I
say jokingly this is the most
predictable news that you've ever
heard Russia and Ukraine have accused
each other of breaking the terms of a
ceasefire on their energy
infrastructure all right
I told you that's exactly what's going
to happen right I told you how can you
have a ceasefire on your energy
infrastructure when both sides are going
to say the other one violated it and
then they're just going to keep shooting
and that's exactly what happened
apparently now I don't know if both
sides did violate
it the prediction is not that they would
violate it but they would definitely
claim the other side violated it and
then they would act accordingly which is
what's happening how in the world do you
ever reach a peace deal with the two
most lingest countries in the world I
mean Ukraine is the least the least
reliable honest country that isn't
Russia so it it doesn't feel like you
could even make a deal because you need
you need both sides to be at least
honorable you know like I feel like we
can make a deal
with a lot of countries and they'd say
ah we don't want to be that country that
doesn't keep a deal um the United States
has broken some deals too so we're not
we're not clean on this but who's going
to trust either Russia or Ukraine for
anything so I don't know how they get a
deal
there and uh I was listening in other
news I was listening to Jeffrey sa talk
about the Middle East and he's sort of
uh you know stay out of the Middle East
it's none of our business we're just
making you know making permanent War um
but he says there will never be peace in
the Middle East until the Palestinians
have their own country
basically um but that's not
possible because Israel has so many
settlements now there's no place that
country could even be and if you said
okay you can take the entire West Bank
and Gaza to do you think that would stop
the extremists from trying to take isra
proper why would it I don't see why that
would stop him so I don't see any
possibility that you can make peace by
giving Palestinians a
country unless that country included
Israel and all the Israelis decided to
move somewhere else which is not going
to happen so there's no actual real
world situation in which you could do
peace in the Middle East which means
permanent War and then Sachs suggests
that Israel essentially controls US
policy and Military and will at least in
terms of the Middle East and uh will
keep us in a permanent state of
War uh because it's good for Israel uh
saak also says that the hoodies are no
big threat to the United States uh and
if we just ignore them because there's
not much I guess there's not much us
shipping that goes through there
anyway um which surprised me me I think
I need a fact check on
that but how many of you agree with him
that we're we're in the permanent war
that can never be
solved meaning that you can never solve
the Palestinian issue and if we're if
we're being
wagged by you know by
Israel then we'll just be in permanent
War I worry that Trump has gotten
himself into at least two permanent Wars
because one of the main things we liked
about Trump is that he wouldn't be in
war and he would end the ones we have
but I don't see him getting out of the
Middle East and I don't see Ukraine
wanting to end the war I think Ukraine
wants to
continue um and maybe Russia does a
little bit
too
so um Trump's really got it he's got his
work cut out for him now my own opinion
is I've told you before my own opinion
is that when countries pursue their own
best interest and they have the power to
do it of course they're going to do it
so if the Palestinians had all the power
it would be really really bad for
Israel uh right now Israel has most of
the power and the Palestinians don't
like it at all but there's no way that
you solve that because they can't both
have all the power it's going to be
somebody has the power so it's pretty
much a win lose situation over there
unsolvable in my
opinion so I saw Zion lights had a uh
post about how France's uh power grid
last year was 95% fossil
free um and most of that was thanks to
nuclear power but they had uh big surge
in solar as well
and so the the context was it was sort
of France is sort of the winner
you know they're the Smart Ones because
they they got rid of their fossil fuels
and they still powered their nation and
they're great on nuclear so it looks
like they're just the big smart winners
and we just look like the dumb ones now
right and then I went to perplexity Ai
and I said um who pays more for
electricity France or the
US turns out
France so the cost of electricity if you
you know for different currencies and
whatnot the cost of electricity in
France is higher than in the
US so who's the
winner is France the winner because they
got to uh all this nuclear power before
we did because that's impressive I I do
I do uh give them a lot of credit for
being so successfully nuclear but if our
energy costs
less than in France
and most of the CO2 if that's what
you're worried about if most of the CO2
is still coming out in China and India
did it make any difference whatsoever
that France had all these green sources
of energy and the answer is I don't know
to me it looks like they didn't win
winning would be they pay less for
electricity and they've done what they
can to save the world but you know they
can't do everything but at least their
own electricity doesn't cost much now if
they were paying less for electricity
than the United States and by the way
I'll take a fact check on this because I
got it from perplexity Ai and we we
shouldn't fully trust the AIS to be
accurate yet um I'd say the US is the
winner right because the CO2 in the
world in general would be the same no
matter what either the us or France did
because again China and India are the
big CO2 producers
all that really matters is what's the
cost of
power and if ours is
cheaper we
won and that ladies and gentlemen is all
