Papa
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and it's
the best thing that's ever happened
and if you'd like to take it up to the
levels that only the psychics could
imagine well all you need is a cup of
mug or a glass so take your chalices
died again flask of vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee enjoy me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing that makes
everything better is gold
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
double sip double sip I'm calling double
sip everybody
double zip go
ah double uh double ah
so good
I just thought you needed a little extra
didn't you didn't you need a little
extra
yeah I think you did
yeah this is a show that gives you a
little extra
well I saw a tweet from a Twitter
account called The Rabbit Hole uh they
showed that white liberals have the
worst mental health at least as judged
by people who went to try to get help
now why do you suppose that would be
well what do you think it would cause
that
what would possibly cause the white
liberals to have the worst Mental Health
what what would be some possible
hypotheses I don't know
I can't think of anything can you
can't think of a thing
well let's uh speculate though
um here are some differences
liberal whites believe the news
would you agree
liberal whites are most likely to
believe the news
imagine how chilling that would be
do any of you you know I assume if you
watch my live stream you know not to
believe the news
right
is there anybody here who is willing to
say they believe the news go
anybody
just one person okay we got a yes
somebody said yes they believe the news
over on YouTube well I wouldn't admit it
I mean it's fine to believe whatever you
want but just my advice I wouldn't admit
that you believe the news
in 2023 that's not really a good look
um so imagine if you believe the news
you think that the climate is going to
fry you white supremacists are behind
the furniture There was a coup attempt
recently you would believe and that
Trump is a Putin Slaughter
Trump is Putin's lover if you believe
the news
um
but conservatives are less likely to
believe the news they tend to believe in
stuff like hard work and family and
obeying laws and
and if and if all of that goes wrong if
you're conservative and you do
everything right you obey the laws stay
off drugs stay in school you know get
married to a good mate and have kids if
you do everything right
and it still doesn't work out
you still got a backup
Heaven yeah well at least it'll be
better later right it might be terrible
now but wait till later wow I did
everything right so I'm going to heaven
so you got one group of people who think
they're gonna you know rotten the Earth
immediately after the climate fries them
and the white supremacists murder them
and the coup takes over the United
States and turns this into whatever
and one group thinks that they have a
perfectly good plan for happiness in
this world
but if that didn't work out
they've got a second perfectly good plan
for an eternity of happiness
what would you expect
what would you expect would be the
mental health outcome of those two
systems
design is Destiny
you have two systems and they're
designed for exactly the outcome that
they delivered
the conservatives designed a system that
delivers happiness most of the time
and the left has designed the system
that almost can't
almost can't
I saw it uh
representative Crenshaw he was talking
in Congress and he was rallying against
the
the trans operations of children and he
said there was a 45
000 percent increase in transition
surgeries at hospitals uh that do the
surgery
and the Republicans weren't quote making
it up
he went on to argue that peer pressure
might be the largest cause of the the
increase peer pressure
and I said to myself
what kind of peer pressure do you get on
the left
versus the right
have you ever thought about that because
there's peer pressure everywhere but the
people on the right get on sort of a
different flavor pressure
for example if you're on the political
right
the the peer pressure and I hear it all
the time
would be to clean your room go to the
gym develop skills find a good mate and
have children
and maybe you know go to church
wouldn't you agree that's the peer
pressure on the right
right clean your room go to the gym
develop skills find a good mate work
hard have kids peer pressure
that's some bad peer pressure right
there
uh but if you're that's if you're on the
right if you're on the left the peer
pressure is a little bit different and
it goes like this
you might be the wrong gender
and scene
so what do you expect that those two
systems would get you the same outcome
both peer pressure it's both peer
pressure
one wants you to clean your room go to
the gym get a job work hard develop
skills find a good mate get married
and the others says I'm not sure you're
the right gender you might not be
so do you think they'd have different
outcomes I don't know big mystery
all right well uh
the publication the hill
had some things to say about Tucker
Carlson's interview with Andrew Tate
and you know they talk about how he's uh
Tate has got a big following for his
toxic masculinity and stuff like that
but they say that they want to make sure
that you know that Andrew Tate is not
the role model you want right that's
what the hill wants you to know
um until they quote where somebody said
this is not a husband father head of
household leave it to be a revision of
masculinity somebody named it Dash guard
said this is a new thing
and that Carlson was you know trying
presumably they say the hill says he was
trying to maybe get that Andrew Tate
audience to you know to be his audience
as well well I would argue
that everybody who's doing this for a
living
wants a bigger audience I'm not sure
that's a revelation yes they interview
people
to get an audience
surprise surprise
all right but uh here's some of the
things that they said
um Tate's audience this is also this
Dash guard person
Tate's audience is primarily made up of
young men who are quote kind of confused
about their place in society
huh
young men who are kind of confused about
their place in society was that was that
confusion caused by
was it caused by Tucker or Andrew Tate
which one of those was confusing the
kids about their place in society
because I'm pretty sure that both of
them had a pretty clear vision of what
the place of place of the Society of
children is and and boys in particular
but I wonder who confused who confused
these young men what would it what would
it be that would confuse these young men
was it the political right
I don't think the right confused him
I've got a feeling that the left confuse
them
uh but it but it goes uh further than
that
so there's some kind of narrative being
baked that the the Andrew Tates are you
know getting all the young men worked up
and here here are the men that they
lumped in the same bucket the manosphere
so now there's something called the
manosphere well it's been around for a
while but according to this article
they're lumping together in the
manosphere all the misogynist people who
would follow Tate and want to be the
head of the household the strong man and
exercise and do all that and have plenty
of women because they're high value men
they put them in the same category as
the incels
does that make sense
the incels are literally people who have
taken themselves out of the man woman
fight they've decided they're just not
going to have women in their life
they're still a hetero they just have
failed and don't want to be part of it
they're literally the opposite
the manosphere does not include
Andrew Tate and in cells
they're not on the same team
I mean they might watch his stuff but
they're clearly not at the same team
all right well I thought that was kind
of silly and maybe it feels like
it feels like the political left needs
to defend itself
from these ideas
and so I saw a lot about Trad wives on
Tick Tock and you know there's this
whole pushback about the idea but
um
here's something that somebody named
Whitney Phillips said a professor of
digital platforms and ethics at the
University of Oregon
he said discourses there's a punch line
to this so wait till the end
discourses around gender and around
gender roles that's just baked into the
cake of a lot of conservatism
is that not baked into the cake of
little literally everything
the genders
is there is the left not
yeah are they ignoring gender I thought
the left was obsessed with it
but sure it's about something about
conservative and uh then the professor
goes on so it isn't a surprise that all
you that at all that you see some
foothold for beliefs such as States even
though they are on the extreme end
are they
are are Andrew Tate's beliefs uh extreme
would you define them that way
I think they seem extreme to some people
who had
you know prefer that they not exist
but it seemed to be that the entire
point of what he was doing
I should not try to speak for him I
guess but my interpretation
of Tate's point
is that uh
it was the opposite of extreme
literally conservative
now I'm not saying I you know support
him or agree with what he's saying
that's a different conversation I'm just
saying he's presenting something which
is literally more like a conservative
traditional time-tested you know tested
through all of civilization
sort of an ordinary
it only seems extreme because of where
things went it doesn't it's not extreme
because where it is
it's extreme because where everybody
else went
he's right in the middle of ordinary
civilization as far as I can tell
which civilization thought men should be
weak
do you remember some civilization and
said you know what we'd like
we'd like the men to be weak
I've never heard of that he's literally
right in the middle of the most ordinary
human biological
philosophy that's ever existed in the
history of human civilization
oh no he's extreme he's extreme
otherwise he's provocative so you could
say he's extreme in the in the sense
League causes people to get all worked
up but here's the part that uh just blew
me away from Professor Phillips he says
that these beliefs exist within the same
kind of spectrum that is
really emphasizing that men and women
are different
now that might have been a little bit
out of context
it feels like it might have been out of
context but still the hill published it
you know so the hill I'm guessing that
the hill is more responsible for this
quote
than the person they attributed to you
know that's the thing right do you all
know that quotes are sometimes made up
even by legitimate media did you know
that
did you all know that quotes are even
even when they put quotes on it it's
actually routine just ordinary that they
make up the quote I don't know if
everybody knows that
even in even in traditional you know
well-established Publications the courts
are manufactured now what they try to do
if it's say the New York Times they're
going to try to make their manufactured
quote
close to what the person said you know
in effect but not always you know they
made sure my edited might take two
thoughts and merge them together it
might take their own opinion
and attribute it to the other person
which you also see
but who would actually say this even if
it was the hill who said it or the
person they're attributing it to it
doesn't matter who would ever say that
it's weird that
um
that there's people trying to assume
that uh or emphasize that men and women
are different
is that really that's your that's your
extreme
some of the extreme stuff is that men
and women are different all right all
right we'll just let that lay there
all right here's something I've been
advising you forever since at least 2013
when I wrote my book caterpillar almost
everything and still went big which will
be republished and available in a few
weeks and I'll let you know about that
um
but apparently apple is going further
into the tracking your mood business
so with their devices and the new Apple
watch
you can keep track of things like
um how many steps you took and how much
sun you got and then where your moon is
so basically if you compare your mood
with what you're doing with your body
and your mind
you can get a better idea what to do
better
now in 2013 in my book had a fail I told
you that one of my habits a lifetime
habit that I strongly recommend to all
of you it was a big theme of the book is
you should track
how you feel
and your energy
based on what you did recently
you should do it every day and you
should never stop it should be a
continuous mental Loop that you go
through what did I do recently how do I
feel what did I do recently how do I
feel and the reason this is so important
is that I recommend using your body
as your solution to your brain
in other words your your brain has all
these little voices in it you know some
of your brain is just taking care of
your bodily functions and some is memory
you know it's like your brain is a whole
bunch of stuff in one place
but you do have an executive function
an executive function it's the one that
can actually tell you to move your arms
and legs okay move your arm Scott do it
get up do the thing let's see your
executive function
your executive function can look at
what's happening to you and say hey I
feel bad today
and then your executive function could
say what have I done recently uh uh
didn't go outside
you know didn't eat the right food
didn't get enough sleep and then you
know what to do and then your executive
function says all right get up walk to
bed
you know cancel those meetings you need
sleep or go eat something healthy or go
for a long walk right
so
those things work almost every time
that's the weird thing about mood
altering activities
they don't work sometimes
it's not like well I don't know if this
is going to work I don't know if taking
a long walk on a sunny day is going to
cheer me up or not yeah I will it will
it works pretty much every time but it's
hard for your executive function
to tell your body to do something when
your brain is unhappy because the
unhappiness is telling you to sit there
and be unhappy so you got to tell your
executive function literally to move
your body
this this is some of the best advice
you'll ever get by the way your whole
your whole life could change by this
advice
think of your executive function as like
a little voice that can control your
body and it tells it to move
because when you're feeling bad the
executive function has to tell you to
move your body to make you happy again
take a walk exercise get out of the Town
take a drive go see a friend go eat
something that's good
do whatever relaxes you
um yeah everybody's got their own method
but that that's the trick executive
function tell your body to move to fix
your brain
and that's what these new devices are
really going to make easily because it's
kind of hard
to remember what you did and remember to
connect it to how you feel etc for
example here's a perfect example
last night I had a massage
yeah it's my it's what it's basically my
one primary rich guy Indulgence so once
a week I have a professional massage and
I noticed that the day after the massage
I always feel terrible
so now I know
that that my mood when I wake up has
nothing to do with anything
I can disconnect my current mood
from anything that's happening like it's
not a cause it's not caused by the
environment of my life is just
there's something about it that just
takes you to another I don't know energy
level or something now I think some of
it is dehydration
yeah maybe I forget to hydrate so I tell
myself literally I had my executive
function this morning saying all right
have determined that day after massage
always feel bad probably dehydration
move your hand over there to that bottle
of water pick it up put it in your mouth
solution
I know as as weird and simple as dumb as
this sounds how many people do you know
who actually live their life this way
they actually pay attention to what they
did and then immediately experiment with
the opposite it's a really good habit to
get into I recommend it these devices
might help
well MSNBC was falling over Biden's
foreign trip as I said it's a
win-win-win they're getting exhausted
with winning making making fun of trump
saying but but here here was the funny
thing that I love the most
what are the hosts a woman I didn't
recognize on MSNBC
said who was it
who decided that the last trip on uh
Biden's European jaunt there who decided
that the last trip would be Helsinki
because that's that's genius
I mean that's just genius that the last
stop was Helsinki I mean that's genius
do you know why
do you know why that was genius I mean
that was genius wow wow do you know why
I don't either
I have no idea
I think it's because where Putin and
Trump had a meeting that didn't go so
well according to the media was that it
just because it would remind you of that
that the left thinks was bad for Trump
Maybe
or Trump I don't know I don't know oh
uh Finland and NATO I don't know I have
no idea no idea but apparently that was
some big deal on MSNBC and when I hear
it I go I don't even know what you're
talking about like the worlds are so
different
like I don't even know what that is
about and yet that's some big deal
genius he's a genius
um
he says statements she he showed himself
to be a Statesman in the world state
but the part that
um oh my God it was cringy
who is the bald guy on MSNBC he's
usually on the panel there what's his
name I can't remember I said Mike
something
um
was it John Hellman okay that sounds
right
um I think it was John who was saying
that um
the Biden showed at this trip
uh he he entered the the Absurd notion
that Biden's age or infirmity are
catching up with him it's an absurd
notion
yeah he actually got on TV
and said on camera while people were
recording him and actually like people
were listening
he said it's a quote absurd notion that
Biden's having any kind of cognitive
problems or ages it's it's kind of
absurd and not only that but he showed
at that table with the other leaders in
some short video he showed that he he's
doing better than any of us at this
table
he wanted you to know that Joe Biden is
not just killing it he's better than all
the younger people who do this for a
living professionally he's that good
that's how good he is and watching his
watching his face when he said it
was the best let's see if I can call
this up before I do I want to show you
this face of
Kamal Harris
does that look like a sober person to
you
do you read that as sober
that's in public
all right let me see if I can quickly
find that I wasn't planning to shout to
you but it's so
it's so cringy that it's like really
good entertainment
I like cringy entertainment
all right I have it in a second here
bear with me all right
toughly missing a beat if I if I want to
run a tape to refute lose
infirmity
watch his face
when he gets back
come on inflation that's a pretty good
double win win
I wanna I want you to see his his face
look at his eyes
and without really missing a beat if I
if I want to run a tape to refute the
Absurd Notions of Joe Biden's senility
or his infirmity I run this tape if I'm
the White House and say that guy is
doing better uh
amazing
um
did did you see how tortured his face
was when he was saying that
all right so this is my impression of
somebody telling you the truth
you know Joe Biden really did a great
job in Europe
honestly he surprised us all his energy
was high and I thought he was quite a
Statesman
all right that's what a face looks like
when you're saying your actual opinion
now let me show you my face when I know
I'm lying and I know everybody knows I'm
lying
oh oh it was a great statement he was so
good I mean energy win win win he was
winning
oh somebody take the camera off of me oh
my God I can't I have to move my face
somebody takes a camera off of my face
please
it's probably pretty hard
all right
let's talk about how the candidates did
yesterday so there was some event Tucker
Carlson was interviewing a bunch of
people it was a Blaze TV or somebody had
some political Republican event
I don't know where it was but anyway
um some news before we get to that so
Trump's new pitch according to ABC is
elect me to get revenge on the
government
Now ABC News is reporting it like he
blew it again you know there's another
another outrageous gaffe who would vote
for a guy like this crazy right crazy
vote for Trump to get revenge on the
government my God my God
to which I say
exactly
[Laughter]
let me tell you something about Trump
I'm going to say something that you can
all agree with okay
you could you could like them or you
could dislike him but I'm just going to
say something you should all agree with
this
that can read a room can he
can he read a room
he can read a room like nobody's ever
read a room
all right and I'm going to give you an
example of somebody who can't read a
room in a minute
somebody who can't just can't read the
room at all we'll get to that but by God
ABC actually thought that I mean I'm
mind reading a little bit I don't know
what they thought but the way it was
presented
was as if there was some negatives that
they had discovered about Trump
right
do you think they presented it as an
insightful political
um you know aha that Trump was
successfully using to take him into the
mountain no that wasn't that it was more
like oh there's that crazy guy again
saying while provocative things that
will destroy the world
except that
revenge on the government is exactly why
I supported him the first time
that's exactly what I wanted
I wanted revenge on the government
now you could call it you know cleaning
the swamp you could call it you know
maybe uh making the FBI more accountable
I mean you could put other words on it
but it feels like
I just want revenge
honestly because I feel like I've been
so abused and all of you have not me
personally but I feel like we've all
been so abused by our own government
that it feels like you have to push back
so Trump of course just feels that
perfectly and then he expresses it in
the simplest way so we all get it
he's just so good at this Rich Lowry did
a long article in the hill
Hill or Politico
I think it was it was one of those
anyway Rich Lowery wrote uh
that it shouldn't you shouldn't be
surprised that Trump is doing so well
for the third Primary in a row
and the reason that Trump is doing so
well
do you know what Rich Lowry uh gives us
the reason that Trump is doing so well
that he's really really good at this
that's it I mean I'm I'm summarizing his
more detailed story but the basic of it
is if if you don't think Trump is good
at being a politician what have you been
watching like what have you been
watching he's just really good at it and
that's the whole explanation you know
some people are going for the the cult
effect and you know the Republicans are
crazy and all that maybe
uh you know maybe no more crazy than any
other group but
how do you ignore the fact that this one
person is just really really skilled at
this thing called politics
yeah you might not want him to be your
president but you can't you can't deny
the skill of the politics
all right who else uh did well or poorly
um
so when DeSantis was asked about Ukraine
he doesn't say he would end the war but
he would rather make Europe pay for
money in the weapons
doesn't that sound like he's trying to
find the the way not to talk about it or
you know just just sort of get out of
the the blast zone it's more like it's
more like he is
you know just trying to fight yeah
weasel right it feels like a weasel
answer now it might not be a terrible
answer
compared to the United States funding it
it's better than that but it still does
allow that you're okay
with Ukraine and Russia having a land
war in Europe
like how could that be okay
now compare that to Trump I would stop
it in one day
well who's who do you back I back people
not dying
I'll stop it in one day well how will
you do that
economics
I'll just put an economic boot on and
I'll make them bull stop in one day
I mean you can't even compare those
answers one is just a politician
whistling the other one is a deal maker
who says there's an obvious deal here
I'll show you how to make the deal
they're not even in the same world
uh as who else did poorly
um
so George will have this long or was it
uh maybe maybe the Wall Street Journal I
forgot I think it was Wall Street
Journal uh George Will political
pundit Observer associated with
Republicans on the right he says that
neither Trump nor DeSantis will win the
nomination
neither Trump nor DeSantis will win the
nomination and it goes through the
reasons why why they won't
and I recommended when I retweeted his
article
that the best way to read it would be
from the bottom up
if you read it from the top to the
bottom you you're going to be really
angry
let me tell you why do you know what the
last thing on the article said it was
something that the editors added
it was at the end after you read this
long long article at the end it says
that George Will's wife is working for
the Tim Scott campaign
that was not mentioned in the article
that was mentioned only by the editors
that look like as an editor's note I
read all the way through here
this argument why neither Trump nor
DeSantis would get nominated when it's
perfectly obvious that one of them will
be
I mean in all likelihood yeah I think I
think if a vac Vivek has a path he has a
real path but
you know it was just a ridiculous
opinion
it was just ridiculous that the the fact
that this was published
no publication should have allowed that
to be published
unless the first line is you should know
that George Will's wife works for the
Tim Scott campaign and then fine
if you say it first
say it first and then I will decide if I
want to read that because if
you say it first I'll know it's
right I look at the title uh neither
Trump nor to Sanders can win the very
first line after that is but you should
know the writer of this his wife works
for the other campaign
and then I would just skip the rest of
it because I would know it would just be
so uh that was a black eye for the
publication as well as a writer in my my
opinion
but let's talk about Tim Scott
he had a good run which I believe ended
yesterday
um
he said a couple of things that I think
are disqualifying for the presidency one
of them is he said and I quote we can
walk and chew gum at the same time
oh God
oh God
did they really say that
no no no Tim Scott damn damn we had so
much hope for you
we had so much hope he seemed like such
a like a good strong solid Republican
Conservative candidate
don't ever say that that's what
Democrats say
I mean basically that's my so I have two
problems with that say one is the most
hack need unoriginal saying and it's so
unoriginal it makes you look dumb
may I say that directly it's so
unoriginal that when you say it you look
slow honestly
do you think do you think you have ever
heard or will ever heard Trump
say this sentence we can walk and chew
gum at the same time will that ever come
out of Trump's mouth
nope
guarantee it I guarantee it he will
never say do you know why
because he can read the room
the room doesn't want to hear that
no the room wants to hear an interesting
new Innovative take
something that moves the the dial they
don't want to hear you repeating a
Democrat
campaign slogan we can walk and chew gum
at the same time they're literally said
it like 15 times this year
terrible oh my God now I'm a writer by
profession of course so if you're a
professional writer and you see somebody
do something like this it's like
fingernails on the Blackboard it just
makes you crazy so I have to admit
I don't think anybody else is going to
be bothered by this
won't change the campaign that he used
that phrase but ugh
um
I'll give you another one
I'm going to give you two candidates and
you tell me which one would and which
one would not use the phrase we can walk
into gum at the same time all right I
won't even look at your answers the two
candidates are Ron DeSantis and Vivek
ramaswamy you tell me before I look up
and see your answers you tell me which
of those might say we can walk in chew
gum at the same time and which one would
never say that
go
yeah you all got the right answer
DeSantis might say that
I'm not saying he will because again
that would be unfair and it would be
mind reading and you know and he's and
desensis is a solid politician right
but Vivek would never say it
did today say that
oh my God I hope not somebody says that
he said that
please don't tell me he said that
please don't
I don't want to ruin my fantasy
all right well
maybe you did say that
but if he did he should stop saying but
here's my bigger point about Tim Scott
he was asked by
um Tucker Carlson about Ukraine and he
says the U.S needs to continue funding
the Ukraine war in order to quote defend
the world order
and uh
wow yeah
he had a good run
I think that takes amount of Vice
President contention
does it because yeah we were thinking he
would be you know in maybe a top three
obvious vice presidential pick for
whoever wins
but I feel like that is such a
disqualifier on the right oh my God
why would he even think that that's okay
to say
like what advisor told him to say that
of all things it's just totally
disqualifying
on the right I mean maybe it'd work on
the left but there's no way it works for
the primary
and then Tucker God bless him
uh was talking about you know the
importance of Russia and Ukraine versus
let's say Mexico
and Tucker said quote all measure all
measures are relative Russia's bad
Putin's evil got it I don't know anyone
who's been killed by Russia I know
people who personally who have been
killed by Mexico
as do I
um
the government of Mexico allows fentanyl
to come over a border The Mexican
government is partied to the murderer of
hundreds of thousands American why is
Mexico less of a threat than Russia
now the the better answer would be
Russia's nuclear weapons
yeah the good answer would be the Mexico
problem is like a gigantic you know
bleeding wound that has to be dealt with
immediately like that's the right answer
you you're not going to rank those risks
if you're running for president you
don't rank the risks you just say we
both of those must be handled and I
would do it without the walking and
chewing gum thing
but um
yeah so I I don't think that uh Tim's
guy handled that well at all and that
could be the end of him compare that to
Vivek ramaswami being asked by also
talking Carlson at the same event
um
about January 6.
so he wanted to give vivekan record
about January 6.
and Drake did something that I've been
in awe of since I heard it yesterday
it's just jaw dropping
well you don't really it's hard to
understand how smart he is
like I feel that's one of his his uh
challenges
and I always say that my dog doesn't
know how smart I am would you agree the
dog might know I'm smarter than the dog
might I don't know maybe does maybe
doesn't but there's no way that the dog
actually knows how smart I am it can't
be known if you're the if you're the
smart one in the room you might know
how unsmart the other people are because
you're as smart as you can judge what
they know and what they don't but from
the bottom you can't judge how smart
somebody is you can only tell they're
smarter than you
you don't know if they're 100 times
smarter there's no way you don't have
the capacity to know that and I think
the vague you know is closer to 10 times
smarter than the average person that
that thing people are imagining he's 20
smarter I'm exaggerating totally but you
get the point if you think he's just a
little bit smarter than you are because
he does some things that maybe you
didn't think of you're really missing
the story
he's not just a little bit smarter than
you
and he's not just a little bit smarter
than me right I put myself in the same
category right now he's crazy smart
and I don't know that we've had that
before since maybe Thomas Jefferson
he actually reminds me of Thomas
Jefferson weirdly
like because he's a you know a
Renaissance type you know his skills
across a number of domains
trumps do too but he's a singular
character
all right so here's uh ramaswami's
answer to January 6. the best political
answer you might ever see on any topic
ever
here's his take you want to know what
caused j6 pervasive censorship in this
country in the lead up to j6 we were
told that we could not question where
the virus came from we were told that we
could not send a uh blah blah blah and
he goes on to tell you all the things
that the system you know the media and
the government and the FBI have lied to
you
that we know they lied yeah these are
confirmed lies from the people who are
supposed to be taking care of you and
being on your side and and he says and
the Elsa said I forget if this is before
or after that statement he says quote
you tell people in this country they
cannot speak that is when they scream
you tell people they cannot scream that
is when they tear things down
and he mentioned the Biden's laptop
being covered up Russia collusion the
coveted pandemic you know BS and when
he's done you say to yourself
that's the smartest thing I've ever
heard
in politics
that's the smartest thing I've ever
heard
there's absolutely nothing that would
have happened on January 6 the way it
did
unless
the public had been lied to and censored
until they thought that physical action
was The Logical Next Step
what what made Republicans give physical
like actually show up on the capitol
it was this it was it was the the
feeling that your words didn't matter
right that you could talk all day long
and it was just going into the The Ether
and being absorbed by the Deep State and
just dissipated
the Deep state made talking no longer
work
by censorship they made the news no
longer work by making it fake
they made trust in the government go
away
by having the dog and doj and the FBI
act against our interests
all of that stuff is what caused January
6 far more than anything that Trump said
or didn't say
far more
and the amazing thing is even before he
got to his reasons
I I had this like moment
like is the moment he said
it was massive censorship that led us to
that date
like every every little Goosebump on my
arm stood up and I said my God
that's it
that's not just
brilliant political framing
is bigger than that
that's the guy you want as your
president
you are somebody who can at least see
the complexity of the situation and can
take it from its immediate form which is
what did Trump say 10 minutes before it
happened
to looking at the the entire system
you know what what was the entire system
and all of its parts that got you to
today and not only did he look at it in
far greater complexity
than anybody in the news or politics had
looked at it but when he added the
complexity
he simplified it at the same time
do you know how hard that is
do you have any any idea how hard it is
to make the topic way more complicated
and then simplify it
it was massive censorship that got us to
this point
wow
 amazing
it's amazing
did he criticize Trump no somebody came
up with some tweets where he did
criticize trump it looks like if they're
real around January 6 when it happened
would you have a problem with Vivek if
his opinion on January 6 had evolved
after we'd all learned more about it
would that bother you if his opinion
evolved with the knowledge right because
if the only thing you knew is what you
watched on TV that day you would have a
different opinion
but you can see that his understanding
of the whole situation has evolved
is extended it into the environment that
made it possible in the first place
and that's exactly the right take on
that exactly
so impressive now I've said you know RFK
Jr has similar skills of persuasion and
of course I've talked endlessly about
Trump's persuasion you have three people
in the race right now who are
extraordinary
no Trump has his baggage so he's
extraordinary plus you know he's he's
carrying some baggage but you know you
could even throw DeSantis in there as
you know a capable executive I'd be
happy to have him you know as a leader I
think he'd do a good job but
he's not campaigning well
you can say that for sure he's not
killing it on the campaign but we have
we have the best group of potential
presidents that I've ever seen
does anybody want to anybody want to
take the other side of that bet that's
not yet about
I say that that even if you if you
include both sides the Republicans and
the Democrats if you include both sides
it's the best group of candidates we've
ever seen maybe ever
I think you know maybe back in the day
of you know Thomas Jefferson everybody
was awesome
so maybe they actually did have better
candidates back then I don't know but
the ones we have now you should be proud
of
you should be proud that you live in a
country that could feel this set of
candidates now if they elect Joe Biden
and this is not even a political comment
I think you should be disappointed in
your country
because we all know that's not the right
play right it's not like the Democrats
think that's the right play they just
think that's maybe the play they have
right nobody thinks it's a good idea
just might be in their opinion better
than the alternatives
but yeah don't be proud of that if that
happens
all right there's another uh drunk drunk
drunk Kamala
meaning that she acts like she's
inebriated we don't know but every time
she's in public she does act exactly
like an inebriated person
and we're just ignoring that right
so we've all decided collectively that
the vice president can get up looking
just drunk or I don't know just owned or
on some kind of drug
in my opinion obviously
how many how many would would agree with
the statement obviously
that she's obviously inebriated like you
can't miss it
yeah I feel like it's obvious why does
the news completely ignore it
is it because they don't have proof so
it's just too far
but nobody can say she's obviously looks
inebriated
it's just obvious
and nobody's ever going to bring that up
heaven
I'm more provocative
all right
um so here's what she said she said when
we invest in clean energy and electric
vehicles and reduce population
what
uh would we invest in clean energy and
electric vehicles and reduced population
more of our children can breathe clean
air and drink clean water
now as others have pointed out she
probably meant pollution
she probably just you know said
population instead of pollution
um I'd like to uh
I'd like to tell you what my hypnosis
instructor taught me
many years ago
that these accidental gaffs are never
accidents
now I don't I don't know if it's true
I'll just tell you what I was taught I
was taught that these are never
accidents yeah you could call it a
Freudian slip if you want but that there
never accidents let me tell you where
you see this the most clearly I think
I've told maybe the people who subscribe
and locals I probably told you this
before
but
um people when people are in a dating
and romance situation
their their choice of words almost
always reveal their point of view
because your your sexual urge is so
strong that it just comes out in your
language when you don't mean it so the
classic example of my hypnosis
instructor gave and some of you've heard
it is if somebody's hungry
and they're just your friend and they
want to be your friend and they're not
think of anything they would say tell
you I'm famished I'm famished
if somebody wants to have sex with you
and they're hungry
the odds of them saying you know I'm
ravished I'm ravished I actually have
that happen to me that that was actually
an example given by the instructor
that if somebody confuses uh ravished
with famished they want to have sex with
you and that actually happened to me one
day
do you think we had sex
yes we did
she she became my girlfriend for 15
years yeah it was and when it came out I
was actually uh I think I was just done
with hypnosis and when I heard it
I said to myself oh there it is and then
I removed all doubt
now one of the things I realized
um you know these many decades since I
learned this trick is that I've never
once
wondered if somebody was interested in
me like romantically or sexually I've
never once because their language just
tells you exactly what they're thinking
and if you're not looking for it you'd
never see it you would never see it if
you weren't looking for it if you didn't
know it was there it would just be
talking you'd never even notice
but
um does she think that the population is
too big in the country she might
I think she just misspoke
but it might
there's a very good likelihood that it
reveals her actual thinking about the
population but there's too many people
might
you know yeah I'd bet on it if he told
me to put a bed on it I would bet on it
but maybe you 60 60 40. you can't
guarantee it it's more of a statistical
thing
um of course the bigger problem is
population collapse uh as Elon Musk and
all the smart people tell you our big
problem is not population increase its
collapse that's the big problem
um
so drunk gamma nuclear energy Department
of the government
has an exciting announcement
so there's a company called xenergy
nuclear which we don't think is related
to Elon Musk names all he's naming his
stuff Exodus and X that but I think
there's no there's no indication that
it's connected to musk but
um is developing a high temperature gas
reactor that they say can't meltdown
is one of two Advanced reactor designs
that is looking to demonstrate this
within the decade So within the next 10
years
there are two startups that the
department of energy is
backing at least with their words and
probably with funding
um that would make nuclear reactors that
can't melt down
now that's the so-called generation four
I've talked about it forever but when
you see it's actually being implemented
and there's a real company and real
money and there's more than one of them
you can say that this is going to happen
so it does look like the next generation
of a nuclear reactors will be smaller
modular and can't melt down and they
might even use the in some cases they'll
use the the spent of fuel and the waste
from other reactors as their fuel
I don't know if this one does that but
that's that's a feature of some
generation four
so that's all good news
some would say great news
so if I were to look at the
the state of the election
in my opinion if something happened to
take Trump out of the primary
and of course it's Trump so you got to
say anything could happen right where
Trump is involved
prediction just goes out the door
because because is
his enemies will do nearly anything you
know Russia collusion to hide the laptop
they'll do anything to keep them out so
you can't predict anything that's going
to happen because the other side will do
everything to stop him but on his side
he's also really hard to predict because
he'll do just about what he needs to do
or say you know to get the job done
so here's my take
if Trump for any reason left the race
I think Vivek would overtake uh DeSantis
tell me I'm wrong
it wouldn't happen right away
I I think because one once you agree
that they need to debate
it's over
it's over
yeah as good as DeSantis is and he's
totally solid
I actually don't I'm not sure I have any
criticisms of DeSantis whatsoever
have I have I ever criticized DeSantis
maybe a decision or something but he's
he's a solid solid
Citizen and and professional
it's just not exciting and I think Vivek
can out excite us
I think he can tell you you can tell a
better story but he would you would just
I think he would just
turn to Santa's into dust
on a debate stage but I don't think
there is necessarily going to be a
debate if Trump is still in the primary
right
I have mixed feelings about Trump
debating
on one hand as long as he has a
commanding lead in the primary debating
is stupid
that would be stupid because it would be
a bad
strategy and you know if Trump did
something that was like obviously stupid
I wouldn't be cool with it on the other
hand
wouldn't you love to know that the guy
who's way ahead is so confident
that he would he would debate anybody
it would be bad
strategy it would just be dumb because
he because Trump could find a way to
lose
without getting any advantage from a
debate like the advantage wouldn't boost
him it could only take him down but at
the same time
wouldn't you love to see it
wouldn't you love to see it and the
reason I'd love to see it is that we
would feel like it would feel like a
free market
free speech
tell the public what you got don't hide
anything
full uh full disclosure full
transparency
see those the things here's the problem
okay maybe I just I just came upon it
myself as I was talking
the problem is that the package that
Trump is selling
requires him also to debate
to be consistent
right because Trump would be you know
Free Speech free markets transparency
right these are all sort of Conservative
Republican things those things all lead
you and even competition
what are Republicans like more than
anything
competition
competition so if the guy who is the
leader of your party who primarily
thinks primarily thinks that Merit and
competition and the free market should
be the driving forces of our
civilization and then he's telling you
he's not going to give it to you
because he's not going to debate because
it would be a bad strategy for him
personally
is that cool
is it cool that he's running for a set
of standards that he's modeling the
opposite of because they're not good for
him personally now cool it's not cool
now I think that that applies to the
right in a way it doesn't apply to the
left
right Biden is an incumbent and I don't
I don't hate the fact that an incumbent
refuses to debate in the primary I
prefer it
but because it makes sense
I don't oppose it it makes sense because
the incumbent has a record that is
effectively their debate
am I right you just look at Biden's
record and that's the debate
and then you listen to what the
alternative person says
and that's their debate so it's not as
good as a debate but debates are sort of
gotcha opportunities you know it's about
it's an opportunity for somebody to have
a moment or to fail but there's not much
information you're not getting a lot of
information right
so uh it would be such a baller
oh you're not you know what Trump could
do
oh this would be diabolical all right
I'm just going to brainstorm this
Trump could agree to debates
and then frame it in public
as him searching for his vice
presidential pick
oh my God
that would be so that would be such a
baller thing to do to agree to a debate
that you're so confident about that you
frame it as your search for a vice
president
hahaha
suppose he said I'm going to choose from
one of these candidates
I don't think you'll say that because
Trump doesn't like the limit limit his
options so he won't say this but just
for fun imagine if you said yeah I'd
like to do a debate because I'm looking
for a vice presidential pick and I want
it to be one of these characters
probably not Pence
probably not Pence but we'll invite him
anyway because you know it's part of the
process
um
that would be so strong it would it
would force the public to only talk
about which one is the right vice
presidential pick and he would make them
he would he would make them think
totally past the sale
and as often as the article said but but
but you have to understand
you know he still he hasn't been
nominated so it's really not up to him
to pick a vice president you have to
understand he's he's getting ahead of
himself it doesn't matter he'll be
brilliant it'll be hilarious
it'd also be funny
if Trump recommended a debate for the
other candidates for the purpose of
picking his vice president and then
don't go you know don't be on the stage
because he doesn't need to
remember Trump also has his you know his
record in office that's his debate
his debate is look what I did
I want to do more of that that's the
whole debate right what else do you need
to know about Trump
is there some information about Trump
you don't know
yeah and that he would reveal in a
somehow he would reveal this new
information for you in a in a debate
that's not gonna happen
so actually um as I'm talking
here's Trump's best play
Trump's best play is to strongly
recommend and debate even oh my God
I was going to say I should host it but
then they would they wouldn't go so he
should strongly recommend a debate so
that he could pick a vice presidential
candidate and just say it say it right
out loud
because everybody's thinking it right I
told you the thing that Trump does is he
says what you're thinking
and he says it you know better than
you're thinking it
and you're thinking those other
candidates are running for vice
president aren't you that's what you're
thinking not patents of course Pence is
not
but you're thinking it
so why not just say it
if he said it everybody everybody would
go all right yeah okay that like let's
get rid of that illusion
let's get rid of the illusion
now
the truth is that I'm sure that DeSantis
is running for president
I don't think he wants to be a vice
president and I don't think Pence does
but Tim Scott
Drake
you know Vivek wants to be president as
does Tim Scott I'm sure but maybe
because they're younger you know they
would go through the vice president's
step to have a better chance at the big
office so they're they're a little
different
that they're they're all running for
president for sure but in your mind
you're thinking well really either it's
a two-step process for at least two of
them
maybe Nikki Elli as well
all right ladies and gentlemen this
concludes
the best live stream you're going to see
today
I like to think I put all the podcasters
to shame with my insights and coffee
sipping it's a package that you're not
going to get anywhere else and by the
way if you count the hour or so I do
most nights from a man cave just for
subscribers of the locals platform
um I give you something like
60 hours
of commercial free programming
on your interest in politics every day
seven days a week
so if you don't think that's worth a few
bucks to get it get a commercial free
two ways to get it commercial free by
the way one on YouTube you can
um
just buy their buy their Pat whatever
YouTube's packages that gets rid of the
commercials I forget what it's called
and but the second way you could do it
is you could subscribe to locals
scottadams.locals.com and if you're over
there you get my second comic Robots
free news which is a little edgier than
even Dilbert reborn so you get Dilbert
reborn 60 hours of
this and that would include all the man
cave episodes which are for adults only
the man cave episodes are not for
children
all right I never went private on this
but I don't think it mattered
um
what about the Secret Service bailing on
the cocaine they found well I think
we've told that story that you know the
story of the Secret Service and the
White House cocaine
uh
is
that they're obviously hiding
it's obviously a miscarriage of Justice
what what else could it be
I mean realistically there's no chance
they're telling you the truth
you know that right
there's nobody literally nobody who
believes that that's true that they
can't find the that they can't find them
and there's nothing else to vote
nobody believes that
yeah
all right
um
so ladies and gentlemen why dilberstein
is always flying right and left
well he doesn't wear a tie anymore
he hasn't worn a tie when when did
dilmer stop wearing a tie
ten years ago
it's been a long time since he had a tie
but you remember him with the time
2010.
do you actually remember that
huh
when did he lose weight yeah he did uh
the the characters did lose a little
weight
just happened over time
they got a person to lie and tell us the
cameras were down
oh let me give you an update on my 1
million
uh one million followers on Twitter
that's coming close
we're at 998.7
so one point
three thousand to go
you took magnesium and overslept sorry
oh it's premium is that is that what the
YouTube service is it preview
uh
do you think the coke was a distraction
now
now
um
don't think so
I don't think you would plant cocaine in
your own house as a distraction
is that how you do it if if you're
trying to
who play who plays drugs in their own
house as a distraction
that might be the worst take of the
entire
political history
did they plant drugs on themselves to
distract from their other problems
strategic incompetence okay
ah I'm gonna be laughing about that
today
I do like I do like your instinct though
I like your instinct that everything's a
diversion from something else because
you're usually going to be right all
right eighty percent of the time you're
going to be right that the news is is
managed to yeah the new news is to get
rid of the old news you know it's there
is a timing element to a lot of this
stuff that's true
but I don't think they plant drugs on
themselves to just
divert the story
all right well anyway thanks thanks for
joining YouTube and I'll
