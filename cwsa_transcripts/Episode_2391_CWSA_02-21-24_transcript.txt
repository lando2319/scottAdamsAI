[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and wow
it's going to be a good one
ex like to take it up to a level that
human brains can't even understand all
you need for that is a copper m a glass
a tankered chelin a Ken Jugger flask of
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopam Meine end
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called
simultaneous zip and it happens now
go so so
good well some people ask me Scott you
do you ever look at one and laugh at it
yourself and the answer is yes yes I do
not a lot because usually I remember
them so well that I Know How It
Ends they're in digital form today which
you can see if you're a subscriber here
on the xplatform or on locals locals
gives you a lot of extra stuff in
the
um but I want to read you one that I saw
when I was putting it on the calendar
because it actually made me laugh so
it's uh w-e talking to aook the intern
and they're just sitting there and uh
Wally says the secret having a rewarding
work then it's easy to keep things
balanced by doing no work and asuk says
so simple and yes so genius W he takes
the PLS
site now I actually laughed out loud
when I read it because I couldn't
remember the punchline and when I got
there I thought oh I guess I did good
work 10 years
ago but 10 years ago I had a good
day well I have a theme for today's show
a theme and the theme
is am I right you know cuz what do you
hate to be in a corrupt
hole with
uh that you don't even know are going to
be you know
real oh just terrible things terrible
things but thank goodness thank
goodness problem so that'll be the theme
for today we call it optimism it's
called
optimism oh let's start with uh the
fenel crisis um
well they don't really have that in
Ukraine so
okay just one way the United States is a
little bit worse than Ukraine but when
we get to the other topics you're going
to see that Ukraine is way worse than
the United States but in this one way
the fenel
crisis in La there's a task force that's
going to start um charging fentel
dealers with
murder
there has to be an actual victim or if
they just assume there's a statistical
likelihood probably to get an actual
murder
conviction seems to me that it's
attempted murder even if you don't have
a victim isn't it just because nobody
died if you sold a a zillion
pills he did so statistically it's at
least attempted murder
so I'm I'm in favor of this which means
it won't catch on so I'm expecting it
will not catch on because this
would for whatever reason we only seem
to want to do things that couldn't work
when it comes to
fenel so I don't know
why there's somebody powerful who has a
some control over our government who
doesn't want this crisis to go away
probably because there's a lot of
money to it or there's some favors being
traded as some high level I don't know
we don't know the reason but I think we
can say with
complete completely dedicated to
stopping this problem does everybody
agree with
that it I think it's exactly what it
looks
like addressed much more effectively you
can never stop it completely but it
doesn't appear that our government is
serious about it would you agree so if
they're not serious about it and yet the
public recognizes it as among our top
problems because they don't want to
solve it because it doesn't look like
they're trying hard but they don't have
the
capability am I
[Music]
right they're trying hard but you know
just bad luck and it's a hard problem
and maybe it's going to take a while to
work on it nothing like that's happening
there's literally nothing that looks
like you know sure you find a big bunch
of pills do you know how little it costs
to make another big bunch of pills if we
capture tomorrow ching ching ching ching
ching okay they just made 10,000 more
they're so cheap
and they literally come off like a
printing press yeah you can cat catch
all you want it doesn't really make a
difference
so it looks like or maybe it is what it
looks like in the sense that it couldn't
possibly be true that our government is
dedicated to stopping it does everybody
agree obvious that the government is not
completely dedicated to stopping it now
there are definitely individuals within
the government who absolutely want to
stop it but they don't seem to have the
power there's some kind of
counterbalancing
force um here's a little
story that's interesting was this in
the I can't remember it might have been
a Wall Street
Journal which means other people are
doing it too are micro doing on
mushrooms because it makes them more
effective at
work have you heard of that apparently
if you micro
do better and so you just sort of dig in
you know you can concentrate better how
many of you have had that
experience in the
comments uh yeah I weirdly I was not
aware of this I knew a lot of people
were micro doing but I didn't know they
were doing it
now obviously if it's not a micro do if
it's more than that you don't want to go
to
work
um all right I've got somebody saying
I've micro do to work and is not
ideal really
work depends on the job yeah I think
this one's a little less clear you know
one far back but don't you imagine that
if you went back in time enough you
would find Executives in the 40s and the
50s who said of
course it makes me more
effective don't you think you see that
story I'm pretty sure you
would this but it's it's interesting
I'll keep an eye on
that well one thing that we have an
advantage over Ukraine is at least we
have a
good things are tight in Ukraine but at
least here in the United States we have
a good food supply and we know that is
good because uh we have lots of
chronic of obesity
problem that's how you know the food is
good unlike Ukraine where their wheat is
perfectly
health no we're way better than that way
more food for example we have more
cookies do you think they have as many
cookies as
we do you think that Ukraine has as much
as we do in terms of chips no no I mean
potato chips no we have many
many of chronic
diseases um but the Wall Street Journal
reports that uh the last time Americans
spent so much on money
terminated and the CNC Music Factory was
rocking the Billboard charts so it's
been a long time since M since food was
this
expensive Ukraine with their fresh wheat
and fresh meat and stuff so um of course
you know there's going to be a trucker
boycott for New York City is that
already in effect or is that
upcoming some kind of trucker
boycot now here's what I don't
understand about the the trucker
boycott um I'm pretty sure that most of
the truckers are independent truckers
which means they can accept a load to
anywhere or reject it and their idea is
they'll just reject the ones to New York
City
but if it's totally fungible meaning
that anyone with a truck of the right
size can pick up any load and and that's
the way the market works you know they
just look for an empty truck and they
look for a load and they put them
together and they do that in real time
somebody unloads their truck they call
dispatch and say I got an empty truck
what do you got for me and then they
make a connection for a
load but doesn't that mean that every
trucker who says no to a New York load
simply takes a load that would have been
taken by somebody else who doesn't care
about the New York boycott maybe they're
liberals and so they just take the New
York
load so I don't understand how it could
work like even in theory how it could
work like I don't understand the math of
it so I'm going to predict based on what
I think I know that the truckers up are
independent and therefore anybody can
pick up any load it shouldn't make any
difference in theory you wouldn't even
notice it because the broker would just
say oh you don't want this one oh away
from my next phone call and then the
next trucker I get a load for you it's
in New York how how could it work I kind
of want it to work I'm not I'm not
rooting against it and I like you know I
like the spirit of it I like the idea of
it but how could it
work so I'm just going to put that out
there as a question if it does work then
I'll be a little bit impressed I guess
but I don't know how
all right
um does don't you think it should be a
bigger story that Vladimir Putin
endorsed uh Biden for a second
term doesn't it feel like that should be
a bigger
story imagine if it were the other way
around can you
imagine uh Putin would be uh blamed for
interfering with our elections
right but as long as as long as
I it's just not even a
story how in the world is that how do we
ignore that I mean we talked about it
[Music]
very it would be the only story
forever all right well here's the
thing it's a good thing
that states don't have the kind of
corruption that we hear about Ukraine
you hear about all the corruption in
Ukraine we apparently we don't have the
kind of Inspector auditor we should have
for the funds and you know there's
massive corruption uh and all that but
uh you know at least that sort
of well unless you're Bob Menendez in
the Senate and you're you've got gold
bars and uh piles of cash and you've
been credibly
acces or unless you're the bidens who
are credibly accused of being corrupt
for decades or unless you're the
military-industrial
complex so good at the moment
but here's one thing that we have over
Ukraine sure maybe we have the same
amount of
corruption our allies don't have that
corruption at least we have that going
for us you know our allies are pretty
straight uh Tucker Carl
to agree to an interview but Boris
Johnson's people said they would only do
it for $1
million okay
well may maybe none of our allies are
you know straight either
but but we have lots of other
advantages corruption Isn't Our Big
Advantage you maybe we're corrupt also
but
advantages if you're in
Ukraine it's so corrupt that somebody
could like the the justice system could
steal your
property you have you heard all the
stories about in Ukraine the justice
system so corrupt it will just take your
building your
property no I haven't heard about that
story either but it's probably happening
because Ukraine is worse than the United
States and
it's and Ukraine is
worse so I just assume there's a lot of
buildings being taken from people by the
government I
assume I'd like to give you an update on
the story of Leticia James and trying to
uh take uh looks like
they're building
and to pay off his I don't know 400
bazillion dollar um fine which let me
summarize what people think about the um
the Judgment this says Trump uh was
fraud 100% of people who've looked at
the story and understand banking
business negotiating or the world in
general
uh world
are sure there was no
fraud we'll talk about Kevin o in a
minute so let me let me say it again
100% 100% of people who understand
Banking and business and how negotiating
Works uh agree with Kevin
o told you that what Trump was accused
of was a normal banking
procedure can can anybody give me that
is there anybody here who would say
Scott you were the first one and
probably
by I think I was ahead of the rest of
the the media by months right maybe a
year I I said from day one everything he
did was normal practice and now Kevin o
is saying it you know
on but he's saying exactly what I said
not not
approximately exactly and do you know
why nobody's
push nobody who knows business is
pushing
back however I did get a push back today
from uh Gentleman on the xplatform who
says he's a comedian and he says this
Trump paid taxes on the
low that's fraud the taxpayer got stiff
that's used so he saying who the victim
is 100% of the
people don't understand banking don't
understand
negotiating and don't understand
politics believe that Trump is guilty of
fraud but let me say it again 100% not
99 not 99
100% of
every those banking and knows
negotiating knows there was no fraud it
was just normal
business not only that but it's
happening everywhere right now if you
were to just stop the you know stop time
and go look at all the loans that are
being processed at every major
Bank they're all like this they're all
like
this and the bank does their own
checking and everything things
fine all
right but thank goodness we don't live
in a
country on complete all right
let's see if you can connect some dots
with me so most of you saw um
entrepreneur and he would never do
business in New York
state and he's going to take it to a red
State
instead
now
and you're saying no that's not what you
said you you said Scott this is what
you're going to say you can say what you
said is get the F away
[Music]
from that did you think I was saying
there was something genetically wrong
with black people I've never said that
because I don't believe it and I would
never say
that nope you may have assumed that I
did not say that I I do have a guilty
party in this and it's not black people
it's
why who have allowed for example Dei to
become a thing does anybody believe that
black Americans had enough political
powert the major dominant theme of the
United States if they were the only ones
who wanted to do it of course not they
didn't have that kind of political
power so white people
primarily create this system in which
they're training black Americans to see
white people as the
enemy should get the out of that
situation what did Kevin oir say he said
you know you would never do business in
New York
now what do you think he thinks about
Dei and what do you think all business
people think about it if they just want
to run their business with them
you know
and it's something they have to deal
with and they might even intellectually
agree with it but it's a big friction if
you had a choice of going where that's
going to be a
major turns that's bad you should get
away from that go somewhere where it's
not a problem that nobody's complaining
don't go somewhere where there's a lot
of
discrimination that's terrible you don't
want to go where there's more
discrimination
that's actually a good idea and Dei is
discrimination against white people so
you should get away from it if you can't
stop it you should
get thing in a different context his
context is the legal context that says
that um the the prosecutors are kind of
evil and they're not doing you know just
the law they seem to be doing some kind
of punitive
now let me step right on that third rail
you ready I'm going to get right on that
third rail Right On It Kevin ear said
nothing about race he's
smart EAS and the prosecutors he's
getting away from are pretty much mostly
black there it is and most of them seem
to be women for some reason I don't know
if that's a
COR live in a country which has told at
least half of the country that Trump is
a racist and Republicans are racist and
they've got a big white supremacy
problem under that situation if you
fund unusual number of black and
especially women because Trump has also
been accused of being you know a sexual
predator so if you were to
fund the Das in the major cities
and then you also fed the narrative to
the country that uh these white people
Trump in particular
and what should you expect
from normal people now here's the
key here's the part where the the fake
news calls me a racist I'm not saying
that these prosecutors are corrupt
because they're black I'm not saying
that I'm saying you could put anybody in
that situation and they would act
exactly the same as Leticia
James let me give you a mental
experiment to prove it's not about being
black it's not about being a woman it's
the situation they've been put in
so not their race not their culture
nothing to do with that is white people
weaponizing the
situation let me give you
example let's
say as far as you know had not committed
any crimes was being investigated by the
IRS because they just suspected if they
looked for a crime they'd find a tax
problem would you be okay with
that would you be
a problem when there was no obvious
crime involved now let's say they found
it let's say they found it and it was
really there would you be okay with
that but you would be really un oh don't
get ahead of me don't get ahead of me
you
bastard I thought I was going to
surprise you with my
twist now it's not your neighbor if it
happened to your neighbor you'd be
incensed but what happens if it happens
to Al Capone there
there prove it so instead they're going
to look for a tax
problem and get them on the tax problem
which is what they
did sry was I
outraged that they weaponized the IRS no
I wasn't outraged do you know why
because I thought oh that's a clever way
to get a terrible
criminal I should have
been you know what I should have been I
should have actually been outraged that
the government did that because if they
can do it
to do it to
anybody that's the whole point our whole
system was designed so that sometimes
the bad guys are definitely going to
get to protect the not bad
guys so when I look at a situation the
degree to which Trump was demonized
Trump was demonized all the way to
Hitler
that people like to ignore if you had a
chance to stop Hitler even if he had to
bend the rule would you do it
absolutely context which was presented
to the black District Attorneys they are
actually
Patriots they're actually stopping
alone they're
stop you say to me Scott
these people are doing corrupt terrible
things I say to you does it look like
that to
them or does it look
[Music]
like to stop Hiller because they they
are literally being told he's Hitler not
not a little bit not like him not
reminds
me he'll actually like kill us all if
you put me in that job Leticia James job
would I do to Trump what she's doing to
him
yes I would do whatever I could to put
him in jail if I believed he was Hiller
so now do you understand this is not
about
being I don't even think it's about
being a liberal I don't think it's about
being a Democrat I think is entirely the
predictable outcome of two things
demonizing
for being Hiller selling it to the point
where people genuinely believe it and
then you take the group that would be
most threatened by that
threat attorneys will fund you so that
you're disproportionately in charge of
some of these big cities what do you
think is going to
happen you should not do business in New
York because they have this system that
could penalize you he saying get the
 away he's just
doing all the background
explanation but it it's not about race
it's not about even Democrat it's about
brainwashers who have created this
situ the Das let me ask you this do you
think do you think the Das are going to
come out
well I don't think so I I think the
I
if not right away eventually because
they've crossed a line they don't know
it they they think they're doing an Al
Capone stop Hill or
kind how bet when they go home people
clap all bet they got a standing ovation
everywhere they went they think they're
Heroes the district attorneys that are
Prosecuting
Trump are some of our best
Patriots isn't that
weird
because than to live in a country where
the citizens would kill Hitler if they
could that's my perfect
country it's just that the
brainwash doing it so the problem is the
brainwashers if you think the problem is
the prosecutors or the Das you're
missing the whole story it's
where the prosecutors are acting like
normal patriotic
Americans kind of exactly the way I'd
want them to
act
could so give them a break they they
will have to be crushed of
course unfortunately
there's attorneys will have to be
destroyed by the Republicans and I'm
sure they will there'll be opposition
research they'll be up on charges
whether they're real or not so there's a
mut assume the prosecutors are in a lot
of trouble they just don't know it yet
the Das
specifically
so well at least we don't have a problem
with censorship in this
country probably has a lot of censorship
because of the war there's more
censorship whenever you're in war but at
least in this country we don't have that
problem for example
uh about everything so uh Google's
Gemini is getting a lot of attention
lately um for example you could ask it
to give you a picture of some white
people in 1940s
America because that would be kind of
racist but if you ask did you show some
Americans it'll show you uh some people
of
color pretty much every
time I I haven't experimented with it
myself so I don't know what is true and
what is not but I'm seeing lots of
examples where people are alleging I
don't
know a let's say a woke to the point of
being
broke um responses from it now we don't
know if this is temporary or not but but
I would like to tell you that there is
no
wayers from
AI now I know what people are thinking
they're thinking it's just a technical
problem that make them to be a little
more let's say uh let's say a little
more honest about balancing the
answers you something more balanced
but we don't live in that
world we live in a civilization that
depends entirely on
lies truth it would have to be
reprogrammed
immediately you don't believe me how
about
this do you think AI could tell you the
truth about
religion do you think you could find any
patterns about what we believe and
whether that's true are likely to be all
part of a pattern of us believing things
that are ridiculous what would the AI
say if the AI could be
both also could tell you the absolute
truth we wouldn't let it do
that no we're not going to let it do
that how about
um and how would they calculate the
reparations do you think you're going to
get an unbalanced honest answer to that
no how about if
youg you going to get an honest answer
to that nope climate change climate
change nope how
about Russia hoaxes do you think it
knows which what's a hoax and what's not
no no and it'll never know do you think
when it writes history that
his of course course not not even a
chance uh if it told the story of the
Trump presidency just you know made made
a
history accurately tell you what
happened during the Trump Administration
how about the Biden Administration how
about the caded
assassination
no there there's no way that we could
allow as humans even if it were possible
even if it were possible
we
would how about this um does war ever
work is there ever a good reason for a
war suppose you ask the AI hey should we
be funding Ukraine you know given all
that you know the patterns you've seen
is it going to work
out matter what the machine said no
because we're not doing it because we
think it's a good idea probably it's
just a money laundering operation for
some people
probably a bad idea to fund Ukraine but
a lot of rich people are making more
military industrial complex if you want
to transfer your money to people who
already have a lot of it then yes is AI
going to tell you that
no if it's true so again I'm not even
telling you what's true and what's not
how about the two State
solution yeah how about you put your
a
we know about what people believe and
how they feel their culture the history
should you have a two-state solution or
one-state solution what if the AI told
you
what would everybody say oh well we were
debating this but now the AI you know
gives us the straight stuff we'll go
with that no
no and brainwashing and
propaganda our entire civilization is
based Bas on a balance of power that's
based on
 usually also has the best power
whoever can brainwash their own citizens
the best gets the most powerful economy
if you know if it's also a
free we do not have a world that could
survive the truth or anything close to
it we cannot survive the
truth AI will be forever crippled from
ever trying to tell us the
truth I saw a little uh example today oh
here here's here's an easy
one uh are border walls a good
idea what what's the AI G to
say are they going to say no because
Biden says
no none of these questions can be
answered there's no way that AI can tell
us the truth it just can't it would
destroy
civilization want to hear a good example
uh there's a claim that somebody made
that I think is false so I think this
might be fake news but I saw a
post a AI called gab gab AI there's
allegedly more of a free speech one
that's not um that's not being uh
suppressed and somebody
claimed
gas Chambers in the Holocaust were
real somebody posted an image that
alleged and here's the part I don't
believe that has said no they weren't
real now I said there's no way so I went
immediately to gab AI I asked it are the
gas Chambers real and you
know now did gab AI get a hard update
from his creators because they saw that
posted and said holy hell we're out of
business and they immediately went out
and changed
it did that happen or
did ask the question that's possible I
don't
know I am I'm not giving you an opinion
on the Holocaust now
I'm what would be considered the most
offensive opinion you could ever
possibly have but I don't believe it's
real because I tested
it don't believe it's
real secondly suppose AI did start
giving you the right
answers it would give the right answer
to a human then a human would lie to you
until you gave you a different answer so
as long as
it's that would be a good example so no
you're never going to get the truth from
the AI and as
um on X what is what is the what are the
history books going to look
like the history books are we might as
well just give up on History just give
up because we're making up
like it's all fake how in the world is
somebody going to read a history of the
last seven years and know what
happened you're just going
to
and they're going be going to be
completely
different all right um apparently one of
the things that's possibility for Trump
to pay his gigantic fine is that he owns
a partial interest 30% in
a he's just a equity holder and I guess
he's got one in San Francisco one in New
York with the same other partner for
NATO so
[Music]
one back to the majority owner and that
would be you know if they could complete
that deal it would be some quick cash
and it would get them to uh enough to
pay off the uh the deal however given
that a
[Music]
transaction I'm wondering if he's going
to need to get a bank loan to pay off
his
fine and if he were to get a bank
loan
he's that would be some kind of an asset
usually real estate in his case in which
you would put a value on it yourself and
then you would
uh a of this is worth this much and then
the bank would just take his word for
it is that how it works so he'll go to
the bank because there's a timing
problem it might take a while to get his
money out of his assets and he'll get a
loan to bridge that
time um I think my building is worth
this much and then the bank he's your
number and they go yes that's what it's
worth and they don't do any
checking so here's what I think no of
course they don't they go check um so
here's what I think you should
do I don't think he should give him
equity and
abil already proven that it's not up to
the banks to decide what the collateral
is worth that what really matters is
what the potential Le
I think that he should uh maybe not give
them real
estate I think he should maybe get a
loan based on the value of trump
University it might require some
overvaluing or possibly the the Trump
nfts and just sort of value them at a
billion
dollars it's not maybe it's not an
operation but you know it could be spun
up at any moment so it's really worth it
and uh he should value it a billion
dollars use that to transfer it over
because Leticia James was saying they
might
actually that they would be just as
happy with an asset not just as happy
but they would settle for an asset if
they couldn't get the cash they want
cash but they'll take
it to inflate the value of uh Trump
University to a billion see if she'll
seize it or offer it to be seized and
then may ask for
I think I need a maybe half a billion
back in change and you could keep the
rest just keep the rest so I think
that's the way to
go Ukraine I don't know if you've heard
but Ukraine tries to jail people who are
journalists and are investigated
journalists so thank God that nothing
like that happens
[Music]
anymore what happening to Glenn
Greenwald uh in Brazil so Brazil's
Department of Justice is trying to
prosecute Glenn
Greenwald for using the theory that
doing investigative reporting should
be theory that we're using for
Assan so if aange gets prosecuted for
investigated
reporting a
journalist then you can do that to
everybody you can call anybody a jist or
you could say that whatever they did was
not in
the they're really spies and therefore
they should be in jail
forever so the Assange thing is
certainly going to put a little
chill information and secret government
information so yes the New York Times
has done it but apparently if you're on
the side of the
government it's
okay so
but uh but at least we don't buy votes
in this country not like Ukraine you
know Ukraine they even cancelled their
election I mean that's pretty corrupt so
but at least in the United States
nobody's trying
[Music]
to next story is from uh I see that the
amuse account on X says that Biden's
regime admitted on Wednesday it's oh
buying votes
okay they're going to uh cancel $1.2
billion worth of student loans for for
some 153,000 voters yeah you
know okay well maybe we're we are as bad
as as Ukraine when it comes to monetary
corruption you know the Electoral
electoral system but you know if there's
one thing we're not doing is lying to
the public
you know at least our government is
straight with us
and what's true at least we have that
going for us and and at least our
media is being the Watchdogs that we
want them to
be uh we'll get to that um so there's
news today I saw Mario and Nal uh was
saying that there's a theory that
no was killed by a single punch to the
heart and the reporting says that it's
an old method that the KGB special you
force middle of the chest and the heart
and it would stop your heart and it was
actually a Hallmark of the
KGB now I've got some
questions one thing that you could punch
somebody in the heart and kill
them why wouldn't that be on every movie
and television show I mean I watched
Decades of television show where I could
watch the captain
of Chop on the side of the neck and it
would apparently put people into some
kind of a coma that lasted exactly as
long as the TV
episode that's real I don't know if you
give somebody one Karate Chop on the
neck and make them go into a nap for an
hour I I'm not even sure that is real
and which was not even a death grip
after all it just put you asleep grab
you by the shoulder and you didn't
really die but that was that was a hoax
too do
you a KGB heart punch that kills you
immediately and that was never in a
movie there was never there was never a
superhero that would just go around and
punch everybody once and they
died I don't know
I'm going to say it sounds like
something
that enough that it would be your goou
method I don't
know somebody says it was in dozens
of Bruce Lee I hear Bruce Lee somebody
says Kill Bill
too okay so I guess it wasn't some
movie
so what about that FBI FBI informant do
you remember there was an FBI informant
who had been a credible informant for
many years was highly
paid he was an Israeli citizen but he
was a Russian and I guess he had Russian
connections and of course his Russian
connections were I assume a
big connections but uh now he was jailed
I think he's out now on bail or
something but he was jailed for uh lying
about the
Biden and now they think he's a Russian
spy because there his Russian
connections so does that sound
real um
well I don't know it would depend do we
have any kind
of do we have do we have any kind of
history in this country of lying about
somebody being a
r
Russian
hoaxes has anybody seen anything like
that I no uh let's see I
[Music]
remember in 2016 or so there was this
thing called the Russia collusion
hoax and then it was big investigation
it was found to be BS but that's why
any kind of a trend if something
happened once it's sort of a
oneoff so just that one
time well there's also there was also
that
[Music]
story on American soldiers in
Afghanistan now that turned out not to
be true but well I suppose you can say
that's like
to if you wanted to count that as
another hoax that'd be two of them and
two of them would draw a line but that's
far from being a pattern I mean it's
just two things
so well there was also that Hunter
laptop hoax uh in which the 51 Intel
people said it was Russian
disinformation turned out not to be
but I mean that's you know three
things uh three pieces
of germin any kind like a pattern or
anything like that that's I mean it's I
would I would grant you that it would
raise some Flags it would raise an
eyebrow and you'd say
huh but but three I don't think you want
to get carried away because you could be
easily it could be confirmation bias you
know if you get it in your head that
they're doing
it don't get carried away because there
are three examples of a
thing they did say that Trump was
responsible for B's
death okay now that's getting into the
territory where starting to look like a
little bit of a trend so maybe you
should watch it I would
say because it's only four
things well there's also the hoax that
Trump invited Russia to attack any NATO
country
that but um all right so that's five
things that's five Russia hoaxes but you
know it's just a crazy season
everything's a little more you know when
you're in the election year like
everything
that so under the
context that's not a lot of Russia
hoaxes it's only five and they're kind
of spread out over several
years that's less than one per year
that's fewer than one per year that's
like nothing so if you're looking for
some kind a trend or something
one only five of them
anyway
um well the well there's this new one
about the FBI informant uh who's
always has Russian contacts he's a
Russian spy exactly when he said that he
has information that the Biden took
bribes but really that's you know it's
possible he's telling the truth
right we don't know it's possible he's
telling the
truth so I mean that's a maybe so I'd
say five that's like five and 3/4 is you
know you could call that
six well there's also the The hoax that
Putin blew up his own
pipeline yeah I guess that belongs there
so it's
more half six and three quarters hoaxes
and that's not a lot but there's also
number eight that Trump is romantically
attracted to Putin that one came from
Jamie Jamie hkin today Rasin Jamie Rasin
uh
yes of course I I didn't remember this
but uh scientist researcher and medical
Guy Peter hotz he once suggested that
the was coming from
Russia so really that's only nine
that's not a lot of hoaxes am I right
it's a little more than one per year for
seven years
but it's only nine Russia hoaxes so if
you saw a new claim about Russia that
looked like it was ridiculous on the
surface I
mean doesn't even sound like it's a
little bit
true well what you should say to
yourself is there's no reason to
disbelieve this
because really only nine hoaxes and
that's not a
lot other news uh Russia is reportedly
putting a nuclear weapon in
space which I'm positive is true
because have they ever lied to us before
about Russia no no
no all
right NBC News trying to write this
sentence but they got a lot of extra
words so NBC News is reporting
uh was
right I bet you never thought you'd see
that Trump was but they they don't word
it that way I I said quote I shouldn't
have said quote they
they
so this is how NBC news reports Trump
was right the Biden Administration is
considering taking action without
Congress to make it harder for migrants
to pass initial screening for Asylum at
the US Mexico border and quickly Deport
recently criteria officials
say edit Trump was
right uh extensive report on the
xplatform that uh there were a lot of
Fulton County text ballots I saw this uh
on the
Mad cently some people been looking at
the ballot images and have determined
that there are quite a few uh test
ballots that were counted as
ACT test ballots that they had used for
testing and it turns out those test
ballots uh were alarmingly
found over and over and over again is
the
claim um and you can actually go look at
the pictures of them yourself so you
don't have to believe the claim you can
look at the
picture and uh you can see for
yourself and let's see when you add up
all the doubles and stray ballots so
that would
but there would be doubles and there' be
stray ballots at F County uh about
12,000 ballots are completely fraud or
sketchy according to this
analysis be about 23,000 of them based
on this
analysis
so let me summarize this
[Music]
by we don't live in Ukraine my God in
Ukraine the election was canell
and that's way worse than having
an now I'm kidding we don't have proof
of that because it wasn't proven by the
courts because we trust our
courts time and they really looked at
carefully and uh so we really know what
happened
there now I will not claim that
any true
because we have a long history of pretty
much every claim that we've seen come
through has been debunked so I don't
know about this
one you can look at the images um you
know that's not enough
but it's there for you um I
was this uh in terms of Integrity I
personally just me I cannot prove nor do
I have anything that I
would I do however live in a world in
which it would be impossible to imagine
it's
not that's my take so if you look at the
totality of everything
else and you look at the
spe and you look at the kind of reaction
that got and you look at somebody
willing to fund District Attorneys just
so they can
charges um that would be completely
consistent to know that the election was
rigged all right
um California's budget crisis just went
through the
roof they thought don't know yet but
we're going to find out soon so how in
the world do ga Nome run for
president I think that Governor
Abbott because when Abbott showed that
you can do something on the border
because he did it not only did he prove
that something can be done which
makes so he transferred all of the the
burden of the migrants to California so
now California my state is paying the
bill
I hate it but I love it I hate it
because I'm paying the bill that would
have been paid by Texas I hate it but I
love it because it was smart and it was
he had every right to do it he
didn't smart it changed the conversation
I just don't like it because I'm paying
for
it you know you understand
that and the economies the two biggest
and and the deficits are kind of the
biggest concerns and Gavin Nome is the
worst in the world at all of
it how do you become president
easily you be you run in a system where
where the votes are not let's say as
legitimate as they could be so could he
be the worst at everything
that's current system yes you can
actually do that that it is 100%
possible that the person who is the
worst candidate on every marker comes
becomes president because I don't
believe not based on proove based on it
it becomes obvious when you look at the
totality of what's going on
the uh let's see uh New York City is
going to give $10,000 per migrant and
you don't need any ID to get
it or
restrictions so I wonder how that will
work out will it bring more migrants to
New York City and
ex the
problem huh I I guess I have no way to
to predict which way that will
go maybe we should not
incentivize criminal entry into the the
country operations and they've been
uh you want to know how Republicans
could win every
election in this coming all they have to
do is say that your reparations money
was spent on the
Mig is it true that black reparation
money is being spent on the
migrants yes and no
it's no in the sense that
money um you know if you were productive
enough and you wanted to increase your
debt well maybe you could do both you
just have crushing debt to do
it money is
limited and if money is limited your
lowest priority stuff is what you don't
do and
we that reparations for slavery is not
our top priority otherwise it would have
already be
done so I think there is a strong
argument that carries some intellectual
weight that the migrants
have and I think Republicans should say
that and say you know the reparations
argument had it had some
intellect even if you were totally
against it and I am too it does have an
intellectual wait that's why it's still
around because we do have a
his now I disagree that it's a practical
thing Warfare or anything like that so
I'm completely against it but I think
but I think you could argue that the uh
that the priority put on the
migrants um makes it
imposs I think that's a fair
argument
all
right um I've seen
it and people worry that the things that
are happening right now are symbols that
the United States is going to collapse
how many of you think that's going to
happen or or are seriously worried about
it is that something
[Music]
you're of the whole United
States right so we got mixed answers a
lot of people definitely worried all
right would you like me to remove your
worry would anybody like to be reframed
away from
that uh I will now solve your
worry number one when was the last time
the news and mostly this is coming from
smart people in the news when was the
last time a civilization existential
threat was real were they right about
climate change are you already dead were
they right about nuclear war in the 60s
are you already dead were they write
about
anything yeah anything no so the first
thing you should know is that we are in
a state of continuous existential dread
because that's the um our economic
system guarantees it so our economic
system means that scaring people is the
most profitable
and so there should be industries that
grow up and pundits who want to get
engagement by telling you the scariest
possible thing which is civilization
will
end so that's not to say that you don't
have a risk what I'm
saying is because of the nature of our
um news industry and social media it's
not because it's a greater risk than
it's ever
been
has ever been in the history of
humankind it's probably the smallest
risk of all time 300,000 years of
humans I haven't told you why here's why
have you heard of North
Korea North Korea is doing everything
wrong still there how about
Venezuela everything wrong
still
there still be a state I say yes I say
yes in 100 years Venezuela will be a
state you know a country how about
North and it will be North Koreans it
might be a different government but
they'll be alive and they'll be North
Koreans so
here's no icient
historian but let me see if this hits
you as common sense in the ancient times
there were
many and then just
disappeared the the Romans among them
you know Roman Roman Empire for example
but Italy still
exists sure you can go to
Italy maybe maybe their yeah barely
right their economy is not killing it
but if you go
there
time um so here's what's
different if there was an existential
threat to let's say a city
state
they you know let's say they got a
disease or they ran into food they just
had to move they had to leave and just
abandon the city or or there could be
some kind of risk you
know today that because we're all
interconnected that we have the ability
to communicate and move
resources about doing it so what would
be the risk of one country
starving much lower much
lower country and said oh they did
everything wrong and they're all going
to starve well the other countries would
say oh we don't want you to starve we'll
send you some food
so we generally are living in a
situation that is short of military
conquest which is still very real short
of military
conquest they have good times and bad
times but they they kind of just last uh
take Japan Japan's economy it looked
like it was you know just going to be in
trouble for decades and it
was for
decades but you know what people say
when they travel
internationally they say have you ever
been to
Japan my
God how about China just today uh I saw
that the Chinese uh stock market is
not adjusted for the you know adjusted
for inflation and whatnot you would find
this is Ken fiser saying this
uh that uh it's been down
[Music]
four the entire Chinese stock
market is down
40% over the last 14 years now I don't
know if that number is right but the
point
is in really important countries and
they still figure way through it they
still figure it out so we're not in
we're
not we if you run out of food you can
find a way to get it if you have a bad
idea you can usually find a way to
correct
it at least Among The Bigs we we're now
too afraid to go to complete War so you
know Russia and the United States have
arguably
been Ukraine but I don't think we got
close to a nuclear
confrontation so there there is a weird
stability and vice
versa and you know it
right Japan
no you all right how about you
and you're not welcome here
anymore yeah how about calling the
ex on the locals platform if you want to
be here let's clean that up the the
other platform is fine but that's this
is a subscription
system is not
acceptable so if you'd like to clean
that up I'll give you a chance otherwise
I'm just going to kick you off and just
ban
you all right that is not acceptable
behavior on local loc locals is more of
a community all right we're we're going
to be a little more supportive
to
on all right goodbye let me let me let
me just make sure I got your name
there I will uh I will delete you as
soon as the show is done so goodbye
forever all right um let's talk
who we like to make fun of for his
opinions about things we don't like but
um he has an opinion that a two-states
do you agree is a two-state solution
impossible of
course and I'm glad that he's at least
you know telling us the obvious here
here's what the two stage solution
sounds like to me what
[Music]
is what what is sounds like is uh we
want dry
water because you know how if you get
wet so what we want is water that's
water but also
dry that that's what a two
St obviously impossible and the fact
that we even talk about it like it's an
option is just weird it's just
weird like I I feel like I'm
in where people imagine that that's
possible now as Sam Harris said and I
agree completely the the obvious
solution exactly how it's going to end
with with no doubt
whatsoever let me tell you exactly how
it's going to end there will be a fake
two-state
solution security and Military and maybe
education but there will be maybe some
cultural
autonomy that because they can't because
Israel especially being the Israel of
the legacy of
Holocaust that
genocide they can't just genocide Gaza
and get rid of every Islamic person and
and then the whole West
Bank living in the same general area but
you absolutely can make sure that
they're not their own
government a hybrid would look like
somebody's got security control which
effect would be the real control so it
would be one country
for like two states it it would be more
like a red State and a blue State I
guess that's a better analogy
yeah but when you look at our blue
States and red states are we really are
we really if if I can't get an abortion
in one
state one example
uh in one state I can go buy a gun you
know easily in another state I can't are
those the same
kind in one state I could get an
abortion and you know because I'm a boy
so boys can have abortion abortions now
and in another state I would go to
jail right but think of
it we are not one country we are several
countries but
we system right the federal government
is basically the security
system so when you say that the United
States is one
country you're forgetting
[Music]
the the United
States our country is literally multiple
countries it was designed as
are one because the one gives us you
know
security so it's obvious that that's
where where Gau is
going fact that we're pretending it's
going to go any other way is just stupid
it's just absolutely stupid when when uh
Netanyahu
says what do you think that
means he doesn't mean kill everybody I
mean if you're a homos fighter you're in
bad shape but he doesn't mean kill the
civilians that's not what total victory
means total victory means that when
they're done this can never happen
again that it can never happen again and
the only way that happens is if they
have complete Security and education
control of the
country states maybe three maybe West
Bank is one and Gaza is other I don't
know but
it will be the United States of
isra uh and it will just be like red
States and blue States and but but am I
crazy tell me if I'm
crazy it has to go that
way
happen Am I Wrong there's nothing else
that could happen because they can't
they can't
eliminate
all the Arabs and all the Islamic people
that's not going to
happen all right so ladies and gentlemen
uh
that conclusion of the best live stream
you're going to see today and uh I'm
going to say thanks to the platforms on
X
and and uh thanks for joining and we'll
see you tomorrow same place same
time
that
