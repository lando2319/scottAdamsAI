[Applause]
hey everybody come on in
come on in gather round it's time
time for her coffee with scott adams
best part of the day
is it good oh it's good you want to see
what it looks like out my window
total whiteout conditions that is
unhealthy air
quality right there forest fires still
uh putting a lot of smoke into my
neighborhood they're not very close to
me but there are so many fires that
i can't go outside
but we don't need to go outside yet
what we need is a simultaneous sip
and it doesn't take much to enjoy it not
really
all you need is a copper mug margaret
glass of tank or chelsea stein the
canteen drinker flask vessel of any kind
interestingly my traffic is very small
today
something's going on um
and you should fill that vessel
with coffee or your favorite beverage
and join me for the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better
simultaneously happening right now
go
ah well i think that cleared the air
quality a little bit
i'll probably have to drink some more to
fix it entirely
all right let's talk about all the
things
um the big mystery of the day
is now this is interesting um
my traffic is roughly half of what it
was
yesterday i wonder why that is
is there something going on today
uh your twitter is down twitter isn't
working somebody's saying
oh it could be that the automatic
notification didn't go up on twitter
that's what it was no notification all
right well
let us enjoy those of us who are here
all right one of the big questions is
what's up with president trump not
forcefully disavowing
the racist groups with the emphasis on
the word
forcefully because he actually did say
he would disavow them he's
disavowed them in the past multiple
times but when asked in the
debate as you all know he did not
so periscope didn't post to twitter okay
so it looks like there's a some kind of
issue going on
but here's a uh here's a hypothesis i
want to put out there
president trump and i think i wrote
about this in wynn bigley
president trump is
very savvy about media stuff would you
agree
that he is one of the most experienced
maybe the most
experienced media personality you know
just about of all time
you know who has been interviewed more
times than president trump
not many people and there's a trick that
he would see
coming that i would also see coming
because
like him i get interviewed a lot and
here's the trick if somebody says to you
will you disavow x
and you think to yourself well that
group that you mentioned this group
x they're they're they're a bad group i
can easily disavow them
so let's say it was the kkk how hard
would it be to disavow the kkk
not hard not hard at all socially
socially acceptable easy to do
i disavowed them what would happen
what would be the next thing that would
happen if the president
disavowed the kkk not
in a speech that he's giving this is
important
but rather in a give-and-take scenario
now if he's giving a speech
he can just disavow all he wants and he
doesn't have to take questions if he
doesn't want to
and he can get his message out there and
say yep i disavow the kkk
and then walk away that's all good no
problem right
but what if somebody asks him to disavow
somebody
well there are two problems here number
one
it looks weak when people force you to
say stuff
think about it how do you look when
somebody randomly can make you say stuff
literally make you say words okay you
i'm gonna make you say these words i
disavow the whoever
and then you say the words who's in
charge
is it the person who repeated what what
they were told to repeat
or is it the person who forced them to
say it in public
it's a power thing so that's the first
thing you need to know
the president um seemingly never
i can't think of an exception he never
gives up the
the power position and the power
position
is who's making somebody say something
it's not the person who's
who's just conforming so that's the
first problem
it does look weak now but you say to me
but scott yeah i get what you're saying
you can't just say what other people
tell you to say that would look weak
but come on any fool can
disavow a racist group white supremacist
how hard is that
that's an exception clearly you can do
that
no problem at all right no problem what
would happen if he had
game and out now this is what this is
the sort of thing you learn
if you have uh media training as i do i
i literally have training with a real
expert who sat with me and taught me how
to deal with
media interviews the next thing that
would happen is
you'd get another question okay so okay
so you've
you've disavowed white supremacists very
good very good
do you also disavow the proud boys
okay now it's getting a little harder
right because
if you don't know exactly who the proud
boys are
and i confess i didn't really know until
this morning
you know i've even i've even been
interviewed by gavin mcginnis back in
2016.
so i knew that there was something
called the proud boys i knew they
existed
i've even communicated with some of them
people have messaged me on social media
et cetera
but i didn't know who they were what
they were i vaguely knew that they
you know were were sort of uh you know
like to
like to fight or something and say
politically incorrect things um
but are they are they a white
supremacist group
well they would say no and you know what
argument they would give
for not being a white supremacist group
well the the black members of proud boys
would be a pretty good argument
that they're not a white supremacist
group because it's hard to explain
why the white supremacist group would
have black members
but they do and other ethnicities as
well
but have they ever said something let's
say
about islam or about women
have they ever said anything that the
president would need to put some
distance from
probably yes probably yes but he doesn't
know exactly what they've said
so does he disavow them well suppose he
does
let's say he does so he disavows the
proud boys what's the next thing that'll
happen
do you disavow breitbart
breitbart a publication that has been
blamed by
some people for saying things that
you know other people have considered
islamophobic
or racist or whatever what does he do
he's already disavowed the easy one
white supremacy
and he you know hypothetically let's say
he is sort of tentatively disavowed the
proud boys just in case
don't know what's in there nobody
nobody's quite sure what they're about
i'm not entirely sure but let's say you
disavowed them
now what about breitbart because lots of
people
on the left say bad things about
breitbart does he have to
disavow them let's say he did no it's
not going to happen
right in a in a million years trump
would never disavow
a publication that tends to be
friendlier to him
but suppose he did what happens next
does he have to disavow uh joe rogan
because remember when spotify took on
joe rogan's program
they said ah there's several of these
episodes we're going to have to delete
because they seem you know too friendly
to
white supremacists or whatever they said
spotify's
employees apparently are rebelling so
then what does he do does president
trump disavow
joe rogan because
they would be able to make an argument i
think it's a it's a argument
but somebody could make an argument well
he he associated with
by interviewing mcginnis
there you go he he actually interviewed
gavin mcginnis
he joe rogan interviewed me what about
me
would president trump have to disavow me
because i've been on joe rogan's show
joe rogan talked to gavin mcginnis
gavin mcginnis was the founder of proud
boys
where does it stop so you see you now
even if you disagree with my examples
they're imperfect
the point is the moment you accept
the frame that i'm going to make you say
stuff
and you're going to have to keep saying
stuff because i'm going to keep giving
you stuff to say
and the moment you say uh i don't know
if i want to keep saying the things that
you're telling me to say
you're racist it's over
now the president has taken the position
you've seen it for a long time he just
doesn't like to get pushed around
it's not a good look um and he just
prefers not to
so i think that when you saw the
hesitation
first the first time was when jake
tapper asked
the president to disavow david duke and
the kkk
and you saw the president hesitate and
he's
and he tried to get a sense of who else
he would have to
disavow i think that was the source of
the hesitation
now of course i'm speculating because
i'm not inside his head i can't
know what he was thinking but based on
my own experience with
media interviews i would have seen that
trap
so if i'd been asked that question as i
was answering it
and this is hard to do it's hard to have
a separate thought
that's complicated while you're talking
on camera to
millions of people right it's very hard
to do so you're trying to process
okay if i answer this question what does
that lead to
what's the question that naturally
follows that am i setting a precedent
am i am i walking into a trap is this
one of those do you still beat your
your spouse kind of questions so
i feel as if the president has
found himself you know planning a couple
of moves ahead
and not knowing where it would go and i
think that that cost him
because he would have been better off
just going with it and then changing the
subject
and like i said it's there's a big
difference between
something he could say in the speech
because he can say everything he wants
to say and nothing extra
and then just walk away but when
somebody is doing it back and forth
you know what the next question is going
to be they're going to extend this until
they
they trap you um
how about how about this as an answer
i i often think about how to answer this
you know
if i'm the president how would i answer
it and i think i might go
go something like this to avoid the trap
you know do you do you disavow the kkk
let's say that's the question
here was here's an answer i'm playing
with as a better way to go
instead of disavowing people disavow
[Music]
let's say opinions so you could easily
say
i disavow every racist viewpoint
no matter where it comes from then what
does the interviewer say
so are you explicitly disavowing the kkk
and then the president could say does
the kkk have any racists in it
i'm i'm disavowing all racism
no matter where it is so you know if you
want to make a list
ask yourself if there are any racists in
there because if there's any racist in
your list
i'm disavowing them well are you
specifically
can you say you're disavowing the kkk
well i've already put them on a
terrorist
domestic terrorist list so that's pretty
disavowed wouldn't you say
so uh twitter's down people are telling
me
it's interesting periscope's up but
twitter is down
it looks like people figured out that
i'm broadcasting because the
the traffic is back up
anyway i think i'd go after the thought
of racism and disavow that wherever it
is
i saw that the one of the trump
campaign websites had 33
false or misleading claims that joe
biden allegedly made at the
at the debates 33
false or misleading claims that's a lot
of misleading claims isn't it
33 in an hour and a half now
here's my only point how do you know did
president trump
say 33 false or misleading things
i don't know what the exact count is but
probably
right but here's the thing the people
who
most dislike president trump
if you ask them one year ago name
what's the worst thing about trump
they would probably say he lies
wouldn't you agree that that would be
the number one thing that would come out
of people's mouth at least that's my
experience
now sometimes they'll go with the racism
thing first
but i would say at least number two is
going to be that he lies
he's lied 20 000 lies he lies lies lies
lies
but why don't they say that about joe
biden
does joe biden lie less than president
trump
i don't see any evidence of that it
looks like
joe biden lies continuously
like just full-on almost nothing but a
wall of lies
probably 70 percent lies to 30 percent
truth something like that now why is it
that we don't think of biden
as a liar now some of you do if you're
trump supporters
but why don't democrats see biden as a
liar
when he's wall-to-wall lies all the time
and i think it has to do with whatever
your brand is you know once you've
you've decided that somebody is a brand
you just sort of stick with it i'll give
you an example when i was a kid
it was it was considered a truism
the volkswagen beetles were unusually
reliable
there was something about them being
built with simply or whatever
but the the thought was that uh they're
very reliable
these vw bugs more reliable than any
other vehicle
but yet when i would you know drive
around town
if they were if i saw a broken down car
by the side of the road
the percentage of times it was a
volkswagen beetle
was really really high to the point
where you couldn't
not notice it there'd be like broken
down volkswagen beetles all over the
place
far more than any other car i ever saw
and yet
and yet the reputation was it was the
most dependable car
there was no correlation between what
you observed
with your own eyes and what everybody
believed to be true
i think that was one of the first times
i thought that the world is a crazy
place
uh because it was just so obviously not
true that they were dependable
and it's so obviously true that biden is
a gigantic liar
but one of the things you're seeing a
little bit less
is that that's a reason for disliking
trump
correct me if i'm wrong and watch for
this as we get closer to election
i'll bet you that between now and
election day
the complaint that that trump is a liar
will will shrink you'll still hear it
but the number of times they'll say it
will be way less
and the reason is now they have
something to compare him to
when it was just trump versus whatever
your ideal idea
your ideal of a of a better candidate is
well then it looks like trump's a big
liar because he's being compared to your
ideal honest candidate that doesn't
really exist
but as soon as you get a real one you
get a real candidate
it's joe biden and you start counting up
the lies and it's 33 in 90 minutes
33 lies in 90 minutes how can you
possibly say to yourself
with any kind of you know intellectual
integrity
how can you say ah i'm gonna vote for
joe biden because
i don't want a liar for a president
i i feel like that reason for voting for
biden
just went away because he lies
continuously
all right
here's my take uh two days after the
the debate when
when the debate is fresh you have you
have a certain set of feelings because
you can remember a lot of the details
so there will be things that feel like
they're having an effect on you
because you remember them they just
happened you're thinking about it it
must be important because you're
thinking about it
but you get just a few days away from it
and
memories being what they are you start
forgetting
slices of it and you're forgetting this
and you're forgetting that
you're forgetting that pretty soon
there's not much
left of your memory this is just normal
way memories work
so what's left after a few days have
gone by
and there's lots more political noise
and distractions and
suddenly here's the memory that you'll
be left with
from that debate there was a contest to
see who could
 the most and trump dominated it
that's it that's sort of what you'll
remember because that was the visual
and it was sort of the the overall theme
and feeling you got you'll
you can't forget how much uh
trump was trying to dominate and talk
over biden
and how biden was he was he was doing a
pretty good job of trying to fight back
but it looked like a battle of bullies
because if you've ever watched
biden debate not trump if you've seen
you know past biden debates he's pretty
bullying
but when you put him on the stage with
trump he's the lesser bully
and that's what you remember so let me
ask you this
let's say you were totally put off by
trump's
aggressive you know not following the
rules
performance totally put off by it
but separately you have to make a
decision about the following
one of those two people biden or trump
is going to fight for something on your
side
so you have to pick one of them to be on
your team to be a team leader
and once you pick them they're going to
go do some fighting for you
so whatever they can get whatever deals
they can make
whatever advantages they can get that's
going to accrue to you because you
picked them they're on your team
if the only thing you knew about them
was that debate
who do you pick to get you some
right you see it right
you could hate everything about what
trump did
on that stage but if you said to
yourself you can only pick one of them
and they have to go forth and get you
some stuff
it's a no-brainer you're gonna pick
trump
every time because he
controlled the situation even if he
hated it
that's the guy you want on your team if
you're hiring a lawyer
do you want the lawyer who's the most
polite
no you don't you don't want the lawyer
who's most polite
you might want the lawyer who's polite
to you
but when your lawyer is fighting the
other team
you don't want them to be nice
necessarily i mean unless there's some
advantage to it
you want them to be a killer you want
them to be a shark
so i got a feeling that people were not
as put off
by the the strongman performance which
is what it was it was a
it was showing who who had the most you
know alpha energy
and on that point uh i saw
i saw just a great comment so this is
from francis
martell who is a breitbart international
news editor
and i'm assuming because she has some
spanish words
in her profile that she's hispanic which
is important
to the point and she tweeted this my
hottest take is that hispanics
like this debate because this is how we
engage each other politically all the
time
it isn't uncivil it's just passionate
the pearl clutching about how presidents
aren't supposed to act like those people
doesn't sit well with me and apparently
a number of other people
uh not apparently i saw the comments and
there were a lot of people from uh
various uh let's say interesting
cultures
uh who said oh yeah
same here same here that's that's like
my family
and they and they looked at it and
thought to themselves oh yeah that's
that looks
just like i would expect it to look why
wouldn't it look like that
of course the president is aggressive of
course he's talking over him
of course he's interrupting how else do
you do it
that's exactly how a political
conversation is supposed to look
now i don't have my own
insight into this but there were a whole
lot of people who agreed with it
so that that's all i'm going to say you
know a lot of people agreed with it
um i saw dan bongino's
take on the uh on the debate
and i thought it was a really strong one
so i'll repeat it here
which is that it's a base election in
other words
nobody is trying to persuade somebody
else to vote from the other team
so so everybody's just trying to get
their own people to show up
and it's all about getting your own base
to get off the couch or fill out the
form and actually
vote so that's the first thing and
uh as dan points out strategically
did trump make a dent in biden support
by separating him from his far left
well i don't know because a lot of those
people are going to say well
you know i'm still closer to biden than
i am to trump
i don't like trump so maybe but
what about the people who were sort of
just not that excited about voting maybe
they would have maybe they wanted to run
on the fence it's not a case that they
would have switched their vote to trump
but rather they're just not going to
show up
and vote for biden because they're just
not as excited
maybe they were bernie supporters and
they feel like they were thrown under
the bus
so did the president uh make his point
that the biden supporters are are not
all on the same page
i feel like he did as as dan
bongino pointed out i think he made that
case
and he made it well but what about the
um
the problems that trump gave himself by
his
let's say bad performance on the
question of
disavowing uh white supremacy
do you think that cost him any votes
from his base
and the answer is probably not because
there's nothing that happened in the
debate
that trump's supporters are not
accustomed to in other words is sort of
more of the same
oh okay we we already know he doesn't
like to be pushed into saying stuff
we already know he doesn't like to be
into apologizing clarifying
defense he just likes to play offense
and so that's what you get now to his
supporters
we've all seen the compilation clips of
him
clearly and and and strongly
disavowing white supremacy and racist
and the kkk
so if you're a supporter you know that
the claims against him
are even if you understand that
the way he handled the question was
completely botched which would be my
take on it
now my own take he did lose my vote i
told you this
you know yesterday personally he lost my
vote
but i also have never haven't voted
lately so it's not like yes any big
difference
um and and as i explained
losing my vote is just personal it's
just personal
it's not anything i would try to talk
you into i would not try to talk you
into it i just spent
way too much of my own personal currency
debunking that will find people hoax i
just wanted a little hand
and i didn't get it i took it personally
all right
so that's just me you don't need to
follow that model i wouldn't encourage
you to do it
so yeah the bongino analysis i feel is
solid pretty solid i think the president
might have
done nothing you know to hurt his base
and probably hurt biden's base a little
bit that could matter
we'll see
the court packing question i thought was
interesting and by the way
if you recorded um tucker carlson's show
from last night
you got to watch that thing you know
tucker carlson is probably one of the
strongest opinion shows on
on tv not probably it's one of the
strongest opinion shows
best quality most interesting you know
most creative takes on stuff i would say
but last night's show was kind of a
masterpiece it was one of the best shows
i think he's ever had and one of the
points he talked about
was the importance of this court-packing
question
that joe biden avoided and
i had not really thought it through
as much as you know tucker you know
fleshed it out a little bit and here's
the thing that i was missing
the court packing question isn't just
a little throwaway preference kind of a
thing
it is the end of the republic and
that was not obvious to me at first and
here's how it's the end of the republic
if right now the republic depends on
you know the uh the equal branches
having their own power so that the
judiciary is somewhat independent
from congress from the president so that
they all have their
individual powers but what would happen
if court packing became acceptable
because the first time it happens won't
be the last time
it means that whoever is in charge will
just pack the court until there are 150
people on the court
but more likely and this is the
this is the the scary part
there's a very there's a very uh
possible scenario that goes like this
democrats win the presidency democrats
win maybe even the senate
and then democrats pack the courts
what happens if democrats have the court
congress and the presidency at the same
time
well under our current you know highly
polarized situation it would
almost guarantee that they would modify
the system
until they couldn't lose ever again in
other words it would be everything from
jerry-rigging to changes in
you know how how many uh how many states
are there are there are in the union
they might accept let's say except
puerto rico and guam
turn them into democrat strongholds no
no
i think it was not guam maybe it was dc
so i think puerto rico
and d.c become states they would both be
democratic states
democrats would control everything
that's it you could very easily reach
the point where we're a one-party system
and we're this close to it were this
close
all it would take was a good election
cycle this time that's it and once you
have only one party
they can use the court to lock
themselves in
because you know republicans might try
to challenge it say hey
you can't do this or that because it's
illegal and then the court says well
we're a bunch of democrats and we always
go democrat
there it is so we actually are this
close
to losing the republic and the biggest
part of that is probably the court
packing
if the court packing is allowed and joe
biden
is not saying no to it he's actually
open to it apparently because
he's not saying no so
if that doesn't scare you you should
and here's a frame that i think would be
useful for the president
people like certainty more than they
like
improvement this is a very important
element of human
psychology if you say would you like
something to be better
everybody says yes of course i like
improvement
but if you said would you like
improvement
at the risk that there could be
you know might go wrong well then it's
different
then i'll say depends where i am in life
and what's going on
maybe maybe i'll just be happy with
where things are
because the risk of trying to improve it
could blow the whole thing
biden is the risky play here's why
you don't know what you'll get if you
elect
if you re-elect president trump do you
know what you'll get
yes you do you totally know what you'll
get with president trump
because first of all he has a very
strong record of doing what he told you
he would do
or at least trying to do what he said he
would do
that's that's kind of unique about trump
is that you can really bank on
on what you expect him to at least try
to do
right he's going to go hard at china
he's going to try to build a border
border wall he's going to you know keep
taxes low
pretty much everything about trump you
kind of can predict
will he continue to do things which his
critics will call
racist of course
will they actually be racist probably
not
probably not but you will be accused of
it of course
so a second trump term
would look a whole lot like you expect
it would look
what would a second bi or what would be
a biden term look like
number one who's the president you don't
even know who the president is
number two who's running biden who is
the power behind biden
not so sure if you get biden how much of
the green new deal do you end up with
even if his intention is to stick with
the biden
green deal you don't know
because you don't know how powerful that
wing of the party will be
a biden presidency is a complete unknown
you don't even know if you'll still have
a republic
literally you don't know if the republic
would survive it
because packing the court is sort of the
end of the republic that turns it into a
or could turn it into a one-party system
[Music]
so uncertainty is a big deal
there's a continuing information
about new testing stuff
for chronovirus so i don't know too much
about this it was just a tweet today
sheba medical center and israel i guess
is testing a new antigen
chronovirus test that could give you a
result in two to fifteen minutes
so and they're working on a i guess
they're working on a saliva based
test so we're very close
to the super cheap saliva test
meaning that you can do it yourself you
don't need anybody to stick anything up
your nose
and i don't know how many different test
companies are working on it
but i'm guessing that the technology
involved
to make a saliva based cheap
no equipment needed coronavirus test
is understood because there are enough
enough different entities working on it
it must be something that
people who deal in this field must know
how to do
so we might be like a month away
from having massive amount of
inexpensive testing
and then it's going to look good so
that's some good news
there's a study out of india that could
be really important
it says that eight percent of infected
people accounted for
60 of new infections so these would be
the so-called
super spreaders so the super spreaders
uh if you if you could somehow identify
who was a super spreader and you only
could take care of them
and nothing else that might take care of
it
because it's such an you know an
outsized
difference and here's a question i have
could you identify the super spreaders
by their genes is there a genetic
dna kind of correlation
because suppose it turns out that in
order to be a super spreader
you would have to have i don't know some
kind of lung
lung situation or maybe a blood type i'm
just
you know spit ball in here there might
be something about you
that makes you more likely to be a super
spreader
now it's possible that all that is is
you have a big lung capacity or you
speak loud
maybe that's all it is so maybe you
couldn't find that um
in in genetics but what if you could
what if you could actually find out that
some people
even if they don't have the infection if
they did get the infection
they're the type of person who would
become a super spreader
that would be useful wouldn't it because
you could say to yourself we don't have
a ton of tests but let's make sure that
the
the people who have a dna propensity to
be a super spreader
let's make sure we test the crap out of
those guys just
test them every day you know
until we have enough tests to do
everybody all the time
so that's just a question um
here's here's a take that you won't see
from people who have uh
better instincts for survival than i do
one of the benefits of these periscopes
is that i can say things that people
don't say out loud
you ready here's something that somebody
doesn't say out loud
too much for all the obvious reasons how
many
children let's say how many 10 year old
children
would you trade for how many
80 year olds let's say
let's say you knew that the coronavirus
was going to take let's say five years
off the age of a senior citizen if they
get it
but if the ten-year-old um can't go to
school
can't live their regular life you know
the everything's shut down
what if they kill themselves worst case
scenario right
kid kid does themselves harm well if a
10 year old
their life is ruined by the coronavirus
in any way that
causes the death the number of years of
life
that that 10 year old had might be 80.
so if a 10 year old were to perish they
would lose 80 years of life
if an 80 year old dies maybe they lose 5
years of life
so if you lost 16 80 year olds
it would be the same number of years of
life as one kid
one kid would be the same number of
years of life as
16 80 year olds these yeah i'm just
making up these numbers but some
somewhere in that range now
in public you're supposed to say this
every life is precious
we don't value one life over another
we don't treat anybody as expendable
and i agree with all of that that's why
you say in public
what do you say in private in private
you don't say that
there are things that you say in public
and you should
every every life is equal everyone is
respected
you're gonna fight like hell for every
single life that's what you say in
public
and you should but it's not what you
think
you don't think that privately privately
you know that the
life of a child is just worth more than
the life of somebody who's 80.
it's just a fact and if you ask if you
ask the 80 year old
well what do you think what do you think
80 year old
do you think we should put you at a
little more risk
to save the life of a kid or at least
give them a life that's worth living
the 80 year old most of them would say
you know
maybe so maybe so you know i had a good
run
so here's here's where i'm going with
this i think
trump's instincts about opening the
economy
which benefits the young at the expense
of the old
right opening the economy benefits the
young
and gives them something like a life
something like
a better education which affects their
whole life
and maybe they don't you know die from
depression and suicide and
drug addiction and all that other stuff
i think the president
is doing in public what every one of us
thinks in private
and that's that's one of the reasons he
got elected because he can say in public
the things that you can only say in
private and he's willing to do it
and i think that the president is very
close to the public
in terms of the trade-off of the economy
versus lives
have you had any conversation in your
private life
somebody says my mom is 86 her life is
not expendable
did i disagree with that did i disagree
with that
in public every life is precious
but the reality is sometimes you have to
choose
and these choices are adult choices it's
not like you get to choose
why don't we let them both live and have
wonderful lives
sometimes you don't have that choice
sometimes you just got to make a choice
and i think that the president's his
bias toward the young is
exactly where the public is and i think
that
um when i hear 200 x
000 americans died of coronavirus i
still don't know one
let me ask you um here how many of you
have a
uh somebody close who died from
coronavirus
because i wonder how how deeply it's
getting into the
you know the everyday public the fact
that i've never met one i i don't know
anybody
actually zero people that i know
personally i i know
people who know people but i don't
actually still know anybody personally
so in the comments tell me
if you know anybody who's died of
coronavirus
and let's say that you did let's say you
didn't know somebody who wasn't a family
member because you're
you're way too biased about family
members but if let's say you knew
an acquaintance who was 80 years old and
died of the coronavirus but the
trade-off was that the economy got
opened
children could go to school people could
live a you know something closer to a
real life
what do you think about that if you had
to make that
choice which way would you go
somebody says in the comments i choose
my kids over my mom
yup because you would choose your kids
over yourself
yeah you would choose your kids over
your mom that's absolutely true
and i i have a feeling
that the public is way closer to trump
in terms of taking the risk of opening
the economy
and also the risks about wearing masks
and all that
so here's the thing that the the
illegitimate
media doesn't ever do they don't really
look at the cost and the benefits
they just like to look at the costs or
they just like to look at the benefits
they don't weigh them and they certainly
don't say
is there any difference between what you
say in public
and what you say in private somebody so
i'm seeing lots of no's
in the comments one says my 80 year old
aunt
governor dan patrick said he would risk
dying to keep a strong economy for his
grandkids
you know the a lot of the people in
their 80s isn't that the greatest
generation the people who fought in
world war
ii etc uh oh somebody's 92 year old mom
had coveted and recovered
good for her a friend's uncle
a single 80 year olds
all right just looking at your comments
uh california
passed a new racist law uh
what did what the hell is wrong with my
state what a mess so
a california base passed a law that
has a ethnic and gender requirement for
boards now
so if you have a corporation with a
board
you'll be fined up to a hundred thousand
dollars for not having
diversity on your board now do i like
diversity
yes i do yeah i do like diversity
is there an advantage to having a
diverse
corporate board yup yes there is an
advantage
there's an advantage socially because
you can say you did it
but there's also an advantage in terms
of just being able to look through more
windows
more points of view how is that how's
that bad of course it's
of course it's good but should it be a
law
given that a diverse board is
unambiguously good for the company
itself
and the company would agree with that if
you asked any of these corporations
hey do you think you know just privately
just privately just you know just
you and me do you think privately
it would be better if you had a more
diverse board
what would the company what would the
company say well if it's a big company
i think every one of them would say yeah
you know it is better
because first of all it will take the
heat office that's good
second of all the employees are going to
like it
because they want the board to look like
them that's good
thirdly our customers are going to like
it because they want
the company to look you know like the
the public
and fourthly you're going to get a
perspective that you just wouldn't get
without
it so of course they want it
but should it be should it be uh
you know a requirement
a racial requirement that is racist
there's no there's no other spin on it
if you have a law that requires that
some races are
okay to put on a board from now on and
some are not
meaning that the next person you add
can't be a you know white male
is just racist um
but apparently that'll happen
uh john thompson on twitter i just uh
twitter user
john thompson had this tweet he said the
violence you see in the streets today
is he calls it woke supremacist
woke supremacist violence and i thought
yeah that is what it is
the the the woke uh protesters
have become sort of a woke supremacist
group
because the woke people don't say i wish
you would change the way you're acting
they say you you suck right
the woke people do believe literally
believe that they're superior
to people that they would consider less
woke so
isn't that a supremacist thing if you
think you're better than the other
people that's what that is right
um
well there we go so i don't know where
we're heading with all this stuff but it
does seem that the
uh all of the racial
and ethnic and gender stuff
there's sort of a logical place it all
ends up
which is failure because if you're
focusing on that
you can't really solve it because you
can never really get to the point where
you know you've got the right balance
and everybody's happy
since it's not possible to make
everybody happy
you have to find some balance of trying
hard enough
that you're trying to make things better
but you haven't destroyed the whole
system
and i don't know how how that happens
um
all right so that's where we're at today
i would expect that the next two
debates you would see trump do better uh
one of the reasons that trump will do
better is because
for whatever reason the the incumbent
doesn't do well in the first debate
it's a weird a weird kind of pattern
and i can't convince myself that there's
a reason for it
except maybe being president is too
different from debating and
presidents maybe have overconfidence i
don't know
but i would expect him to do much better
and what is more important
the debate that's closer to the election
or the one
that goes first well experts say the
first debate
seems to be important but i would argue
that the one that is closest to election
day would be the most important
um yeah my air quality today
is unbreathable so i'm locked in the
house
again once again i'm in house arrest in
my house
oh let me say one more thing about the
uh california law
about the boards so the the board will
be required
to add uh ethnic and gender diversity
but here's the funny part uh you can
self-describe
so apparently you're allowed to
self-identify
anything you want so how many corporate
boards are just going to say hey does
anybody want to self-identify as a
hawaiian
hawaiian native or something anybody
want to be native american
and somebody will say well i hadn't
thought about it before but i'll
self-identify
and you're all set
um yeah the next the next debate
apparently they're talking about cutting
off the microphones
uh the one thing that i think is
hilarious about the first debate
is given the way that they organized it
with these
two minutes you get to talk and the
other person doesn't get to rebut
if the other person doesn't get to rebux
they're going to talk over you
so whoever designed that first debate
they got exactly what they designed
it was designed to give you just what
you saw
especially because president trump was
part of it if you design a system where
somebody can
talk over you and then you say okay i
got this
system where you could you know there's
nothing that would stop them really
except the moderator and you can't
really stop them
and then we're going to add president
trump into it what the hell do you
expect
right so i'm not sure that this whole
debate thing even works
doesn't seem to have any any real point
to it
i will say that i am uh surprised and a
little bit impressed
that joe biden got up the day after the
debate and
still had a looks like a fully
functional day
so whatever it is that's that biden is
experiencing
and i feel like it's unambiguously true
that he's declining and it's very
noticeable that just feels
completely true but
he does have good periods will that be
enough
we'll find out oh yes i was going to
talk about the
kyle rittenhouse thing so apparently
biden has referred to kyle rittenhouse
in a tweet he's
he tweeted a picture of him and referred
to him as a white supremacist
and in so doing made kyle rittenhouse
a rich man because uh kyle written house
has a good lawyer
linwood who has already said he's going
to sue
i think he's going to sue the media some
part of some part of the media
and also joe biden for slandering his
client
now do you think he'll win yes
[Laughter]
i would think this would be the the
world's easiest
lawsuit is you know because there the
evidence of the slanders in a tweet
the the evidence that biden should have
known
that kyle rittenhouse had no connection
with white supremacy whatsoever there's
no evidence
when i say no evidence i mean none
there is there's nothing suggesting it
there's nothing
hinting at it there's nothing there
he is nothing but a good guy
who found himself in a bad situation you
could argue that he made a mistake
being there with a gun and i would not
debate that but he's a good person
apparently and
i think linwood is just going to soothe
the living crap out of
joe biden and i'm going to be pretty
happy about that
if he gets away with it maybe i can get
linwood to
sue some of the people on twitter who
who call me bad things
so how much do you like the fact that
kyle rittenhouse
probably is going to be a millionaire
looks like it to me all right
that's all for now and i will talk to
you tomorrow
