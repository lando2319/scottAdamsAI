Sunday I'll bet you can't
wait show is going to be
incredible all the lazy podcasters
sleeping in today but not me not me I'm
here with your content just the way you
like
[Music]
it good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffeee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure you've never had a better
time but if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need for that is a
CER muger a glass a tanker CH Stein a
canteen Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go oh
delicious probably the best one I've
ever
had well if you're thinking about what
to buy for your Christmas loved ones
look at that stuff behind me over my
shoulder the Dilbert 2025 calendar you
can only find it at dilbert.com and the
link to the sales page and four books
one of which will be just perfect for
somebody in your life so remember that
well there's a article in The Spectator
spectator index there's a new scientific
study that says caffeine might have a
protective effect on Parkinson's disease
did a very large study that's right
coffee can do
anything so if any of you were coming
down with Parkinson's I think the
simultaneous sip has protected you for
at least one more day so no Parkinson's
for
you there's a study according to
cost that uh finds that people who are
in relationships tend to be happier than
being than single people huh people in
relationships are happier than single
people you know how they could have
saved a little money on that
study maybe ask me why just about every
human being who has ever been born tries
to get into a relationship could it be
because it makes them happier possibly
possibly did you know according to no
Ridge I guess that's a publication that
if you got extra 46 minutes of sleep it
can boost your gratitude resilience and
wellbeing for those of you who didn't
know that extra sleep is good for
you yeah no it turns out
sleep healthy food sleep exercise I know
I
know every day we're surprised to find
out those things are good for
you just should have asked
God but here's one that's surprising
according to
arus arus University I like this
University name a a r h u s
ahus where do you go to school arus
University I like it anyway they did a
study and found out you can satisfy your
appetite just by looking at pictures of
food on your
phone well that's going to save me a lot
of time because I've been wasting my
time eating and pooping and I can just
scroll no I'm just kidding you still
need to eat no matter what but uh here's
the interesting part you have to see the
same picture 30 times and then you get
bored with it and then you don't want to
eat it so if you're hungry and you see a
picture of your favorite food once it's
going to make you hungrier you'll be oh
I'm so hungry I want those french fries
or whatever but if you look at it 30
different times not only will you be
bored but you'll be less less
hungry now what does that remind you of
let me tell you remember I taught you in
my book reframe your brain which is over
this shoulder right there reframe your
brain one of the uh stories in there is
that um if you don't already know this
along with my audience here on my live
stream we cured the common cold I'm I'm
sorry the common sneeze not the cold I
haven't cured a cold yet
yet but uh it won't work on every sneeze
what doesn't work in the sneeze is the C
the you know sort of sneak up on you but
if you know one's coming and you're
petting a cat and you don't want to
scare the cat you can actually imagine
the sneeze and it cancels the
sneeze now you don't believe that works
do you if you haven't tried it you don't
believe it works but a lot of people
have tried it including me a bunch of
times it works yeah it won't work on
every sneeze like not the fast ones that
just like hit you but if you can if you
know it's coming for like 30 seconds
just imagine yourself sneezing and it
goes away it's the damnest thing so I do
believe this study about looking at Food
30 times I do think that could
work meanwhile robots are going to get
some sense of touch because you know
robots can all can already hear and see
and some of them might even be able to
smell but but they're not good on
touch uh so they've got some kind of
light related thing they bounce some
light off the surface and then the robot
can tell what kind of surface it is it
can tell uh coarse sandpaper from smooth
sandpaper for
example and uh I think we're all
thinking the same thing aren't we are we
all thinking the same thing yes we are
yeah you're not going to have any good
real robot zxs until the robot
can
touch that robot needs to know that your
body is not course sandpaper but rather
something Sent From
Heaven and that can touch you just right
yep we're very close to robot sex can't
wait according to axios Israel destroyed
an active nuclear weapons research
facility in Iran in that recent
attack now this raises some
questions so these are the things that
we were told we can know we know that
Iran had a secret nuclear
site okay how do we know about the
locations of n of Iran's nuclear sites
and that's pretty good intelligence
number two not only do we know it exists
but we know where it exists and we know
what specific components they're
building there so apparently there's
something called a
uh plastic explosives that surround the
uranium and the nuclear device so if you
don't have a way to make these specific
plastic explosives it's a little hard to
detonate so the Israelis not only knew
where the plant was the secret facility
they knew exactly what component it was
making for the nuclear weapons and how
far along they
were and and then they bombed it and
then here's the here's the
punchline it was such a secret um
facility that only a small group of the
Iranian government knew about
it okay let me put it all together this
is what Israeli and US intelligence
seems to know they knew that Iran was
building a nuclear weapon or at least
working toward it they knew where the
site was they knew the specific
component that was made of the site but
now here's the impressive part
they knew which members of the Iranian
government knew about it and which ones
didn't if you were Iran wouldn't you
just
surrender I mean I mean seriously if
your enemies know this much about your
most secret
Secrets I would just give up because
there's something going on here that's
seriously putting you at
risk either there are agents in just
like every
every part of Iranian government which I
imagine might be the
case uh or or they're
lying that the other possibility is that
we don't know this stuff and we're just
speculating because if if we had bombed
let's say Israel had bombed a site that
wasn't anything let's say they' bombed
the wrong site one way to cover that up
would be to say that even the Iranian
government wasn't aware of what was
happening there because then when the
Iranian government says there was
nothing there we could say say that's
what I told you I told you the whole I
told you even your own government didn't
know it was there it's a good thing we
blew it up well what was in there well
you should ask us don't ask your own
people they they don't even know what it
was there but we do it was plastic
explosives I don't know I'm not sure how
much of that story I'm going to
believe um so there's reports that
Elon Musk met with some
Iranian Diplomat or
diplomats now we don't know exactly what
he might have been talking about but
people speculate it might be to try to
get some kind of progress toward a
eventual peace deal now we just assume
that because why else would he be
talking to
him but here's my question why aren't
they acting like that's illegal because
you can't just go negotiate with another
country if you're not in office
right is that is that even legal I'm in
favor of it let me be clear I'm
completely in favor of Elon Musk talking
to Iranian
diplomats even if he's nego not
negotiating per se but if he's seeing
what's possible and what's not possible
I'm totally in favor of it why because
he's not uh he's not a politician he's a
problem solver he's an engineer he's a
technologist
and if you wanted to get past the
politics and just figure out what works
he'd be the person I'd ask I I'd
probably ask him first okay we need to
just engineer a way around this how do
we do it because the trick is how could
you create a situation where everybody
has security and good
economics and they feel that the past
has been dealt with in whatever way it
needs to be dealt with
it's hard and one thing we know for sure
is that our politicians are not capable
of it so if I knew that there were no
politicians capable of threading that
needle I'd ask somebody who is capable
of threading every needle in different
situations so he'd be really high on my
list of somebody I'd want to talk to at
least once now what one of the odds that
Elon musos had a solution and he just
said well here's what I do and then the
uranians are thinking H that might work
low I mean it it's close to being an
unsolvable
problem but I sure love the fact that
both sides took a run at it um maybe it
moved something forward maybe it didn't
but here's the here's the interesting I
think this was an
axios
um it
said this sentence is an axio to IR an
is attempting a diplomatic hairpin turn
from uh allegedly plotting to kill Trump
to floating direct talks with his
government now do you see anything wrong
with that
sentence that tran is attempting a
diplomatic here been turned from
plotting to kill
Trump what is the evidence that Iran was
plotting to kill
Trump the evidence was that the people
we think were plotting to kill Trump
were using Iran as their as their
scapegoat now it seems to me that it
looked like it was an internal job that
we were trying to blame on
tan I don't think there was any chance
that the leadership of Iran plan to kill
Trump let let me say this as clearly as
possible if I had to believe Iran when
they said we're not we were never
planning to assassinate Trump or I had
to believe our own government saying oh
we've got information we're trying to
kill Trump do you know who i'
believe i' believe the one that's saying
something completely logical and
credible there is no way there is no way
that the Iranian leadership wanted to
kill Trump I mean they wanted to but
there's no way there was a plan because
their country would be
destroyed the they would have to
know Iran would have to know that
killing our president would remove all
of our options we we would eliminate
their government you know that right
there's no chance there's no chance that
the Iranian leadership could have
survived killing Trump no chance zero
you don't do things where you have no
chance if it were a coin flip you'd say
oh those crazy bastards those crazy
bastards are going to take a a 5050
chance of killing our president it's not
5050 it's 100% chance you're all
dead every time whatever it
takes it wouldn't matter we we wouldn't
care about collateral damage we wouldn't
care about anything except wiping out
every single part of their leadership
they know that of course they know that
that would be the easiest thing you
could know you don't even have to do any
research on that it's just
obvious so no I do not believe for one
second that the leadership there might
have been some crazy elements in Iran
but I don't believe the leadership
wanted to take Trump out not even for a
second all
right
so um on the all-in part I guess uh
Jason and David Sachs were talking about
the collapse of the Legacy
Media and uh part of the conversation
was about how Pharma is big Advertiser
there and uh one of
them was it was it David Sachs one of
them said if they lose advertising from
Pharma it's over um because that's their
main advertising is Pharma msnb M MSNBC
ratings are down like by
half blah blah blah and now they realize
they're deceived by MSNBC and they've
lost credibility so uh I don't know
which one's on the all-in Pod because I
I take bad notes I think it was probably
David
saaks but do you think that's the right
explanation of why their um viewership
dropped by 50% as soon as the election
was over do you think it's because
people said oh I can't trust my new
source I don't think that's what's
happening here's my take MSNBC is
designed as a dopamine
source it's a dopamine Source it's not
news it's things that will feel good to
a certain segment of people who are
their viewers so if you want news you'd
find out facts without an opinion if you
go to MSNBC they'll say let let me
explain this to you for the millionth
time you dear viewer you are ethical and
moral and smart oh you're smart you care
you have empathy un like unlike have you
heard about this orange Hiller oh my God
you are so much better than orange
Hiller you're smarter you're Kinder you
have better ideas you believe in science
that's how awesome you are and so if I'm
watching MSNBC and I'm a little low in
my dopamine I'll be like
really I didn't even know I was was that
smart can you tell me more about how
smart I am oh look look half of the
country is dumber than
me oh look at the dumb
people oh my God they're all like weird
they're weird and crazy but not like us
not like us we we got our College
educations and we're we got our we got
our act wait what just
happened what what what just
happened he's he's
ahead no he gave me a
hand what he he just won the election he
he couldn't have no I've been watching
in the news for four years he couldn't
he couldn't have he couldn't have
he he couldn't have won the
election
what by a
landslide and people are wearing their
hats in
public
um click
and then you turn off M
MSNBC why are you turning it off because
their news was not
accurate No you're turning it off
because your source of dopamine went
away there's no dopamine that's it it
was just like an addiction to Feelgood
so as soon as it became plainly obvious
to everyone that the viewers of MSNBC
were the dumbest people in the entire
country and I say that unfortunately
it's just true because they believe that
the news on MSNBC was
real that those are the dumbest people
in America if you believe that the news
is real sorry if you think the news
about politics anyway and geopolitical
stuff if you think that stuff's real
you're the dumbest people in America if
you think that science should be
trusted because it's science you're
among the dumbest people in America you
don't understand how anything
works and the realization that you're
among the dumbest from going from the
smartest all the way to the
dumbest that's devastating so here's
what's going to happen do you recall
that there was the same drop when Trump
won the first time I think there was
this like there was a big drop the first
time most of that will come back do you
know why it will come back well at the
moment Trump isn't doing anything except
awesome things that they have a little
bit to talk about but mostly hasn't done
stuff because he's not in the job yet
for the second term so as soon as he's
doing stuff then they're going to have
stuff to complain about and they'll be
able to complain their old way oh dear
viewers let me tell you how smart you
are cuz you never would have made this
mistake that Trump and all of those Mega
fools are
making look how smart we are you know we
were right K Harris never would have
made this problem would she I guess all
those voters were dumb after all so if
there was any temporary moment when you
thought you were the dumb ones well let
me talk you out of this we're the Smart
Ones you're the Smart Ones and let's
stay away from those other those
terrible Mega people and if they show up
for your holidays well don't even let
them in don't let let them in at
all so yes I think their viewership will
come back when they can write their ship
and start doing more dopamine direct you
know fake
news but the other point I wanted to
point out is something that I didn't
know for a long time but I didn't know
how cable news the so-called Legacy news
makes their
money I thought hey they advertise so
they're making their money from
advertisement and the reason that people
advertise is so that you will buy their
products turns out none of that's
true which is quite a mind that the
advertisers are not trying to get you to
buy their products that's not even why
they do it and and the advertising is
not the most critical part of the the
revenue number one the cable news people
get revenue from the cable provider so
if the cable provider wants to offer
MSNBC they got to pay for it so most of
the money comes from the fact that you
can't offer a cable network with a full
package of of programming unless it
includes your major news entities on
both sides nobody's going to buy that
package so as long as the consumers
would expect to see these news programs
in their
package the news programs get
paid now when I said that the
advertisers are not trying to sell
products I mean the big Pharma the
Pharma companies advertise so that the
news doesn't want to say bad things
about
Pharma now the news will say bad things
about Pharma if there's you know if the
news sort of comes out on its own but
what you're not going to see is any of
the Legacy news media put together a
team to do a deep dive on whether a big
farma is screwing us and killing us
there will be no investigative
journalism on their
advertisers so the reason big farmer
advertises is not so that you can watch
a commercial that says and if you
had that's the name of a new drug
they're all hard to pronounce but if you
if you
took then you would cure your suspicious
disease that you never knew you had so
it has nothing to do with getting you to
buy it has everything to do with just
bribing uh the news entities is not to
go after the big
Fara all right uh Mark
pen he was an adviser to the clintons he
says that uh all the insulting Trump as
a Hitler and a fascist didn't work he
said the politics of
demonization uh did not work quote I
think that they went over the top here
uh Hitler fascist pick picking up on
these things I think the voters just
tune count those eventually because
they're way over the
top H what do you think of that do you
think that the reason it didn't work to
go non-stop fascist fascist Hiller
Hiller is because the people
listening just say that's over the top
so they tune it
out well I don't know anybody who voted
for Trump who took any of that seriously
but here's how I would have framed
it I wouldn't have said it was over the
top so people didn't believe it I would
have said this the election came down to
people who believe news is
true versus people who know it's
not and I think there are simply more
people who know it's not so it didn't
matter that it was a story about fascist
or Hitler it could have been a story
that Trump murdered a baby it could have
been a story that he did anything it's
just that the PE that the people who
voted for him just assume all the news
is
fake and I think that the number of
people who think the news is fake is now
bigger than the number who think it's
real so when you hear stuff like that
you go oh that's the fake one now it
works both sides by the way fake news
doesn't come from Only One Direction it
comes from both ways but if you but if
you understand that you're more likely
to just make your own opinion about
whether you want Trump's economic
policies and let the rest go so yeah I
think that's what it is I think it's
people who believe the news versus
people who know it's mostly
hoaxes there's a study by uh this was on
axios too a study from Columbia business
school uh they did this after the 2016
election and they did find that two out
of three um people who didn't want to
tell you their opinion about politics
two out of three voted for
Trump so it is true is confirmed by
study
that in 2016 when when I was telling you
every single day there are secret Trump
supporters that are lying to
pollsters it was 100%
correct right now a lot of you saw too
it's not wasn't wasn't like I was the
only one who had that idea um but I said
that that was also going to be true in
this
election I said that this election too
the people who are act like they're UND
decided or don't want to tell you what
they think they're going to be Trump
supporters and sure enough I just asked
perplexity the search engine if this
2024 election had uh secret Trump
supporters and according to perplexity
the answer is yes H and the reason the
answer is yes it says is because if you
look at the the uh let's say the average
of the
polling on average under ped Trump
and if all the Poland companies all
under Poland I think they most of them
did maybe I don't know 80% or so under
pulled
them then that's a pretty good
indication that the the Trump supporters
are hiding not that every single one of
them did a bad
poll um so here we are again now here's
the here's the fun part Mo do you know
how I always tell you about my quote
smart Republican or or smart Democrat
friend so I have a longtime friend who's
very Democrat and things have not been
good through the Trump ERA with he and I
Because he believes the news is
real and I say that not as a joke he he
reads the New York Times and he watches
CNN and he believes that he learned news
and it's
real now obviously I can't have a
conversation with him about anything
because he thinks those things are real
but on top of that he's also an expert
in
polling like he gives public speeches on
polling techniques and what to expect
and how to interpret them and stuff an
expert on polling so prior to this
election I asked him if he thought the
polls were going to be right and he said
uh you know I told him I thought the
polls were under sampling Trump again he
said oh that may have happened the first
time you indeed indeed he was under
pulled the first time but pollsters have
now figured out a number of ways to
correct for
that and I thought to myself
really how how do you correct for the
data you don't have what exactly is the
method for
correcting for the data you don't
have now I used to work in the data
analysis field you know before I was a
cartoonist mostly I was looking at
budgets and data and projections and
financial Financial forecasts and stuff
like
that I know what it means when you don't
have the data and you
adjust it means you're
guessing it means it just means you're
guessing you can't adjust for data you
don't have that's not a thing you can't
you can't apply apply an algorithm for
the data you don't have
so once again uh and by the way he was
really confident that this time the
polling was going to be accurate so now
I suppose he could still say most of the
polling looked like it was going to be a
tie and the end result was only within a
few percentage points but it did all tip
in One
Direction so I think I'm going to claim
a win on that
one apparently Amazon selling a lot of
of Maga hats according to zero Edge it's
among their top ranked thing so they got
Maga things and several things in the
top 31 hottest new
releases here's so here's my question
what do you think it was that changed
Trump from somebody you couldn't
possibly support in public to somebody
that you want to support in public like
you want to wear the hat what
changed now
I've got a few theories and it's
probably not one thing number one
everybody likes
winning everybody likes winning but we
saw this change even before the election
results so it's not just that he won Al
although that certainly is going to help
it happened before he
won but and some of it was happening
before the assassination attempt right I
think the assassination attempt and his
response to it certainly got and more
support I mean no doubt about it um so
that was a little bit but it was
happening
anyway and a lot of it was economics and
inflation and a lot of people saying how
about I'll just care about myself
instead of caring where where he may or
may not have put his penis 30 years ago
I'll just care about myself for a
moment that's probably a lot of it a lot
of it is that conell Harris is the worst
candidate we've ever seen in our lives
and TR Trump is the best but I think by
the time Trump was in the the garbage
truck and McDonald's and going to the
black barber shop he just broke through
some kind of barrier so I I think he
just broke through the barrier and
people realized that their news is
probably fake and that when it went over
the went way too far into Trump is
Hitler and and we'd seen four years of
him we'd watched four years of him and
it wasn't Hitler
even a little bit
so I think it's like several several
factors coming together so sort of a
perfect storm
situation but I do think that the uh
probably the main thing is that there
are prominent Democrats and hero kind of
Democrats really popular ones like RFK
Jr who uh saw the light and moved over
and then Elon of course probably moved a
bunch of other people
so people like to be on the winning team
they like
to understand that the news is fake and
they like their they like their income
without
inflation all right uh here's a smarted
Democrat so apparently the Jill Biden's
former
spokesperson whose name
is Michael L
Roa now I'm going to quote him
because uh here's where I'm getting
worried because he's actually figured
out what the real problem is watching
the other Democrats not know what the
real problem is so they can't possibly
fix it is is just entertaining to me but
then when I see Michael l l Roa I go oh
oh uh oh he actually knows what the real
problem is so here's in his
words he says uh this has to stop
um he said calling president-elect
Trump's defense secretary nominees and
former Fox News host white
supremacist um and all the Dei stuff and
the fascist stuff and the Hitler stuff
he said the the answer to extremism is
not more extremism voices like this on
the left are turning the Democratic
party into a
joke thank
you now that's not pulling a punch
he's saying that the that the Democratic
party has turned into a
joke that's actually what's happening it
looks ridiculous it look just looks like
a joke it doesn't look like just a
different political opinion it looks
like what's wrong with you do you have
mental
problems he says we've got to knock it
off and get a serious guess we're going
to diagnose politics not make it
worse he says name calling vilifying and
defaming nominees you oppose even if
there is very good reason to oppose them
represents everything the Democratic
party should be running away
from
wow
wow that's exactly
perfect yes everything they're
doing is everything they should be
running away from it's everything they
should oppose now he didn't mention that
the Democrats oppose Free Speech if he
asked them they say they don't but you
see the gigantic network of censorship
that's built up around the Democratic
party clearly it's a major major move
because Trump's trying to dismantle that
that network of Nos and fact Checkers
that are all part of the fake news the
fake uh fake facts world so yes um the
Democratic party should not be
demonizing one group of Americans that's
the opposite of their brand they're
supposed to be inclusive but they're
demonized
they should be for free speech they're
against it they should be against war
and they're for
it they've literally thrown away every
one of
their valuable principles just to
win now apparently winning makes a big
difference because you can do insider
trading and make a lot of money that way
we probably shouldn't make the
government a for-profit Enterprise
because it is right now as as as long as
you can do insider trading legally it's
completely legal if you're in Congress
so if they know that a bill is coming up
or some change is going to be made they
can bet on it it's not really betting
because at that point they know the
Stock's going to move so we probably
need to make the government a
nonprofit if we're going to have the
government work for us otherwise the
government's going to work for itself
very
profitable do you remember the uh toward
the end of the election cycle there
there was this one poll from an Selzer
apparently a famous pollster I'd never
heard of but Anne celer had a poll that
was
unusually
weirdly
proa and it disagreed with basically all
the other polls but it allowed the
Democrats to talk about it for a week or
so about hey this one poll shows she's
going to win you're going to be
surprised give us some more money donate
some money go vote she's going to win
and people like me and people who have
been watching news for more than 5
minutes said oh just ignore that that's
fake most of you said that right when
you saw the news that there was this one
outlier poll that was like wildly out of
touch with the other polls didn't you
say to yourself oh that's just
fake
right well of course it turned out not
to be accurate but uh an szer has
announced her
retirement so uh the account CEO
branding expert look for that account on
which is a good account to follow um if
you like if you like takes on persuasion
and branding and stuff CEO branding
expert he's one of my internet
buddies um so he point his opinion is
she announced a retirement which means
this poll she did was likely a gold in
Parachute oh now we're getting deep so
there's the
thought that somebody who was so good at
polling for them to be coincidentally
have you know the worst poll ever that
was good for kamla and also coincided
with her
retirement the suggestion is that
somebody with a big bag of money might
have said you know you're going to
retire
anyway so wouldn't you like to go out
with a big bag of money all we need from
you is a couple of assumptions on this
poll that are not your normal
assumptions now I'm not making that
accusation because I have no evidence to
support it but if you're that good at
polling and you're that off and then you
retire right after it's going to raise
some
questions it raises some
questions meanwhile I saw a quote from
RFK Jr but I don't have a confirmation
that he really said this so maybe you
can tell me if this is a real quote I
just saw it on a post on X uh did he say
that Bitcoin is quote a hedge against
inflation for middle class Americans a
remedy against the Dollar's downgrade
from the world's Reserve currency and
the offramp from a ruinous national
debt that doesn't really sound like
something he said is that fake because I
don't even know what it means to be an
offramp from the national that I don't
know what that would
mean
so fake what do you think is that real
or
fake I I haven't heard him say he's
against
Bitcoin I have no idea uh meanwhile uh
Elon Musk and V ramaswami working in the
the Doge project the department of
government efficiency and of course
they're going to try to figure out where
to downsize government and make it more
efficient and they're looking for um I
love this they're looking for volunteers
who want to work 80 hours a week and
have high super high IQs and for no
money so let's say 80 hours a
week no
money super high
IQ okay that's going to be tough to find
unless they're already very rich
which they might be if they have a super
high
IQ but uh good luck with that you know
if if anyone else asked that you would
just laugh it off but if Elon Musk and
VI say we want you to work eight hours a
week it's going to be terrible you have
to be brilliant and we're not going to
pay you it's actually
attractive like if I were you know
younger and smarter and live closer to
in New York Washington DC I guess uh I'd
be thinking about it but and the reason
I'd be thinking about it is that I could
be working with a whole bunch of
geniuses who are doing the most
important thing that maybe the country's
done in years so that is kind of that's
appealing to me like just just being
part of something that would have that
much impact and importance and require
smart people you know you're not going
to do it with dollars you're going to
need extra smart because the level of
complexity that's going to be involved
it's going to be through the roof the
complexity is just going to be
crazy but I won't be joining that group
I'm not quite the
demographic uh but I love this sentence
I probably from Elon quote we don't need
more part-time idea
generators we need super high IQ small
government revolutionaries willing to
work 80 hours per week uh on glorious
cross cutting uh I like it we don't need
more part-time idea
generators do you know how many people
decided that they had a good idea for
cutting the government and S it to
Elon there must be like a million of
them anyway uh Saturday Saturday Night
Live had Alec Baldwin on as you know he
had his legal difficulties with the
tragic death of uh staff members that
got shot accidentally when he pulled the
trigger on his gun that should not have
had a bullet in
it um but he's getting he's getting some
uh push back because he did an RFK junr
impression so he played RFK Jr and he
did a voice imitation in the raspy
voice now here's my
question if you're going to do an
impression of somebody who has a
non-standard voice
don't you have to do it in the way that
they actually talk is that really an
insult I mean when people would do uh
Stephen
Hawkins they would talk like Stephen
Hawkins I don't know what is happening I
am talking through a machine and I never
thought that that was disrespectful to
Stephen Hawkins because that's actually
the way he
talked
likewise um and I'm speaking as someone
who had this exact problem if somebody
had done a skit about me when I talked
the same way before my spasmo dysphonia
got cured with surgery I spoke the same
way that RFK junor does worse actually
um if somebody had done an impression to
me during that time I think it would
have bothered me but it would only
bother me that it was reminding me that
I had a voice problem I wouldn't feel
like it was
disrespectful in fact I'd think it was
weird if they didn't if they didn't copy
my voice that would be
weirder
so if there's one thing we know about
RFK Jr he has a very very thick
skin I'm almost positive that didn't
bother him or if it did it was you know
for half a second so I don't think
there's any victim
and and also the way uh the way he did
Alec bwin did the impression he didn't
do it as as bad as the original he he
gave it just the flavor of it so it's a
little harder honestly to listen to RFK
Jr than it was to listen to the
impression of him so I thought I thought
that was sufficiently uh
acceptable so I I know we like to make
fun of SNL if they if they don't have a
home run but uh I'm okay with that I'm
okay with
that the post Millennials says that
Democrats are putting together an army
of lawyers to try to thwart everything
that Trump does so like several hundred
lawyers and they've got hundreds of
legal challenges they can take so
basically the Democrats have decided to
tie up the government with lawyers to
which I say
oh God that's going to work I hate the
fact that it's going to work it's going
to delay everything make everything
impossible so Democrats trying to be as
unhelpful as possible
surprise all right um meanwhile I'm
looking at the uh the MSNBC propagandist
trying to take down RFK Jr and it's
funny that they're criticizing RFK Jr
when MSNBC is most famous for being
wrong about
everything wrong about politics wrong
about the pandemic wrong about science
wrong about climate change I mean MSNBC
is the most wrong about science and most
wrong about reality I've ever seen I
mean it's it's actually sensationally
entertaining to watch how wrong they are
but
uh here's Chris Hayes trying to insult
RFK Jr he says it's all like nutty and
in a lot of cases just genuinely
dangerous he's talking about RFK J's
opinion on stuff dangerous
fear-mongering they just corroded
corrupted conspir conspiratorial
thinking and kenedy's most disqualifying
statements the reason uh for him being
appointed to HHS are just as so grave is
his views on vaccines he goes and I
don't want to overstate the case here
vaccines are one of the five greatest
achievements of human civilization Bar
None in fact we've got a pretty good
recent example he says just four years
ago we managed to develop a vaccine in
the midst of a once in the century
pandemic it was the one unambiguously
good achievement of Donald Trump's first
term
really even even Trump's best supporters
don't think it was it was an
unambiguously good achievement no that's
not my opinion so I'm I'm holding back
my own opinion on this but it's
certainly not
unambiguous when even his own best
supporters don't think the vaccine was a
good idea now I'm not saying it's a good
idea or a bad idea because I don't
believe any data from the pandemic in
order for me to know that is save more
lives than it hurt I would have to
believe
data and as far as I know there's no
data that's reliable that came out of
the pandemic it's certainly possible
that it saved more than a killed it's
also certainly possible that it hurt and
killed more than it
saved I don't think there's any way to
know because to know you'd have to have
data and I wouldn't believe any data
from the
pandemic so I don't know but uh it's
definitely not
unambiguous and uh certainly his views
on vaccines as I understand them is that
they need to be better tested and maybe
there should be some some let's say some
more uh risk on the manufacturer and not
entirely on the public that's pretty
reasonable to me here's what I think
you're going to
find I think there's going to be this
slow Evolution from people who have been
told that RFK Jr is a total crackpot who
thinks that all vaccinations are bad
which he's never said and never believed
never said it never believed it that all
vaccinations are bad um and that as he
explains what they've been doing to you
for years and and you start waking up do
you remember the first time you found
out the vaccines are not
tested the at least the way you think
science should test things do you
remember when you first found that out
to me I think it was during the
pandemic I I always took it I just took
it for granted that if you're going to
approve a drug that it goes through at
least one gold standard um you know kind
of a the best kind of trial and that and
then I then I thought when obviously
they also follow it for years so they
know even 10 years later they'd know if
it caused a problem later turns out
nothing like that's
happening and once you find out that
they don't test vaccines the way they
would test anything you'd expect to be
tested once you learn that you like your
brain can't ever get
back you brain can never recover from
that you'll never trust anything in
science again once you realize that you
you thought they've been testing them
for Years nope and and they've never
tested them all
together I mean just think about that
they've got like what is it 70
vaccinations or
something but they they never tested
them like okay let's give 70 of them to
this baby and then we'll have another
baby or a bunch of babies that are not
getting nothing
so one of them will get 70 and the other
get nothing and we'll we'll you know
check all the babies over time now that
would tell you something but we've never
done that and there are reasons we don't
do it right there there there are
reasons why it is the way it is so it's
not completely irrational there are
reasons but I didn't know them I I
didn't know that they had reasons to not
test
it
what it's a to little
mindbreaker so I think what's going to
happen is RFK Jr is going to
slowly um train even
MSNBC that the issue is that the way we
do it and the and what we tell citizens
we have done and your informed consent
those are the topics the topic is not
did this vaccine work that's not exactly
the topic sometimes it is but it's more
about our we doing right by the people
that we're serving in in a variety of
ways meanwhile uh Debbie wasman Schultz
is going on TV of course MSNBC I think
and she says and I I don't even believe
it's just amazing that there's a human
being who can do this she says oh yes
there's no question I can she's talking
about Tulsi gabard I consider her
someone who is likely a Russian asset
and who would be as the dni respons for
managing our entire intelligence
Community hold all of our most
significant intelligence information in
secrets and essentially would be a
direct line to our
enemies can you imagine going on
television and saying there's no
question that Tulsi gabard is a Russian
asset no
question not not even you know maybe we
should worry about it or maybe there's a
indication or you know we've seen we've
seen a little too too much closeness and
I'm uncomfortable with it no just a flat
out statement and and there's no
question about
it the Democrats are terrible
people the politicians not not the
voters the voters are mostly just
confused I think and been lied to like
crazy but Debbie wasam and
Schultz that is such bad behavior
and that's really really bad behavior
this is a human
being telsey gabard is a patriot and an
American citizen and an adult human
being she does not deserve this because
there's no evidence of this and I think
it's stupid really but
wow wow and she can just go on with her
life wasam and SCH skan after dropping
that bomb because once you've said that
it goes
away right unbelievable
wow so what a terrible
person so the Daniel Penny trial has a
more what I think would be eventually
good news for Daniel Penny uh I didn't
realize that there was one of the
witnesses was a a
marine so there was a marine they say he
served with Daniel Penny but I wasn't
sure if they knew each
other or they just served at the same
time or something I was a little unclear
on that but um the other Marine who was
right there right as close as you can
get like right there the other Marine uh
said at one point he thought it was a
blood joke which would be deadly if he
did it too long uh and then there's
another kind called an air choke which
would not be deadly if he did it right
and so his current testimony is that it
could have been an air choke and that
Penny did appear to loosen his grip when
Neely began to
struggle now if the person who is
trained and exactly the same techniques
as the person who was using them was
right there and cannot say he used the
wrong technique because now he's saying
it looks like he loosened his grip when
the guy
struggled that would be a clear
indication that you're not putting a a
blood grip on him because he's still
alive when you loosen your grip that
should be everything you need to know
that should be the end of it the person
who knows the most was standing right
there says no I I cannot confirm that he
had the wrong grip and in fact he
loosened his grip when he
struggled that should be the end of it
we need this Penny to drop if you know
what I mean the golden age is the golden
age has begun but there's just this drag
there's just like this little drag on it
it needs to
go NBC says they have an exclusive um an
exclusive they say the Trump transition
team is putting together a list of US
Military Officers who were directly
involved in the withdrawal from
Afghanistan that was a big debacle and
exploring whether they could be Court
marshal for their involvement all right
so let's put all the things together
it's an NBC News
exclusive it's an anonymous
source and it's bad for
Trump in a way that's important you know
his his relationship with the military
so only NBC has a story it's an
anonymous source and it would be
negative for Trump do you believe it no
of course not of course not now that's
every tell in the world for a fake story
NBC is a tell for a fake story exclusive
is a tell anonymous source is a tell
anti-trump is a tell you put them all
together uh I would say there's almost
no chance this is true here's what I
think is probably
true I do think that they may be looking
at the people who were involved in the
Afghanistan
withdrawal I do think that they may
have in terms of conversation said I
wonder if any of these people should be
Court marshaled
that's not like they're starting with
court Marshal and then looking for
people to put in jail or to or to court
Marshal it's more like they're looking
into it because something really really
bad happened and they want to understand
it and and avoid it now if it turned out
that they found some unusually bad
behavior well a court Marshal would be
in perfectly acceptable outcome except
for the court marshall person so so I
feel like this is closer to maybe
something that was
conversation that MBC is trying to turn
into more a little bit more than just
you know if this happens we might do
this let me let me give you another
exclusive for
NBC if a UFO lands in my
backyard I might keep it a
secret that's
it there's your news
I don't know if I did I
might all right here's some more NBC
news so NBC News it says the election
showed a what they're calling a diploma
divide where voters are increasingly
split by education level huh let me see
let's see the Democrats just went
through a humiliating loss they showed
that their framing for just about
everything didn't match what the
American public was seeing so wrong
about everything but now their new take
is that what's happening is there's a
diploma divide and uh oh there are more
people without diplomas than with so
that would explain why those dumb old
magga people won because they don't have
diplomas that's kind of up let me
tell you my
interpretation uh my interpretation is
that the people who believe in fake
news got everything wrong and the people
who knew the fake news was
fake came pretty close to getting
everything
right so what we've proven is that a
diploma makes you more brainwashed and
likely to think that you know that
science is real and not having a diploma
apparently is correlated with having a
much better understanding of what is
real yeah so how about instead of
showing that the losers were the Smart
Ones yeah the losers were the Smart Ones
because they got the diplomas so they're
they're the Smart Ones Still they're the
Smart Ones yeah they lost they lost but
it's because there's so many dumb people
without the diplomas now how about the
people who won are
smart because they knew how to win and
they knew what was true and they knew
what was not and how about the people
who are all the Smart Ones are pretty
 stupid and they show surely they
know it by
now surely they understand that as a
group they were very wrong about not
only their strategy but all of their
policies all of their policies and all
of their strategies and all of their C
and even their top candidates were just
stupid all right now you can tell me oh
but all the stupid people have the good
diplomas well apparently a diploma
doesn't help you I guess diplomas are
worthless because if what you can get
with a diploma is a Democrat level
terrible campaign terrible candidate
terrible
policies I would say that disproves the
value of a diploma no I don't mean that
you I still think diplomas have value in
this world they're
overpriced but if you can get one it's
probably worth
it yeah but this is not it's not a
diploma problem it's a people who
believe fake news problem and the reason
NBC News can't find that frame is that
they're part of the problem they're part
of the fake news so they'll they got to
sell you some other frames so it doesn't
look like their fault meanwhile commo
Harris's staffers that they thought they
were going to get paid until year end
but they're they are already cut off
because they're out of money post
Millennium is reporting on this uh um do
you realize how much of a bullet we may
have
dodged by keeping Harris out of office
is there anything happening in their
campaign with their fiscal
responsibility that suggests to you in
any way that she would have handled the
national
debt where was her Elon was she going to
get Elon and VI to uh bring down the
national
debt no as far as I know she had no plan
for bringing down the national debt am I
right no plan Trump had a
plan and and he's implementing it and
it's a very aggressive plan it's
probably the only one that would work
which is massive restructuring of the
government and doing it fast nothing
else is going to work certainly nothing
else so she had no debt
plan and she she brought in about twice
as much money as Trump
spent more than she
had Trump brought in half as much and
didn't even spend
it which one are you going to trust with
your
money I mean I I Feel Like These are
really easy questions who are you going
to trust with your money right now I get
that you know Trump was once bankrupt
Etc but if you look into the history of
that you'll see that has more to do with
some really unusual things that happened
like one of the things things the
Democrats like to say is that uh Trump
uh failed in a casino in New Jersey and
you think to yourself how in the world
do you fail in a casino and the answer
is that things changed in the local
government that made the casino no
longer viable so who saw that coming
like who would have seen that there was
some change in government that made your
business suddenly unviable inviable and
then also with his real estate stuff
there was a period where I think there
was a tax change that made what he was
doing suddenly a bad idea from a good
idea so I think the story of Trump's um
where he's had financial problems were
because the government made a change not
because he made a bad a snake and it
wasn't wasn't the kind of change you
could have
foreseen so keep that in mind and then
he also came back from it which is even
more interesting story there's a
Connecticut teacher who got
fired for saying terrible things about
Trump
supporters uh on a video on social media
now Breitbart is reporting this she was
a special ed teacher and she is really
mad at Trump's supporters and she got
fired for it now the question I ask you
is would she have been fired in 2017 for
doing exactly the same
thing I don't know I'm I'm hoping that
what's happening is that we're seeing
some some normaly
returning where if you're a school
teacher and you say that you know you
want to physically abuse half of the
country maybe your employer needs to act
on
that there's a story that NASA employees
have asked Elon Musk to quote clean
house because they say that they've
wasted a bunch of money on Dei stuff
just millions and millions on it and
it's just slowing them down they want
him to they want Elon mus to help them
get rid of all that Dei
stuff um this is also the post
Millennium reporting on
this I I don't know if that's every NASA
employee there might have been a
few this is one of those stories where
when you hear NASA employees it doesn't
say how many so could have been five
NASA employees say we spend too much on
Dei and the rest of them decided to stay
quiet because it's too dangerous but I
don't I don't disagree that there are
NASA employees who think they spend too
much on Dei uh I.E every single white
male and now finally do you know Rick
Rubin uh Rick Rubin one of the most
successful music producers in the world
has worked with some of the biggest
names uh all the big ones you've heard
of you're familiar with a lot of the
music that came out through his
production of
it anyway he's got a philos philosophy
about
creativity that says you should create
for
yourself so you should not be thinking
what does my audience want and then make
what they want rather you should make
the very best thing that you would want
and then that's the most likely to also
be successful because if it's something
you really want well chances are
somebody likes it
too well that is on one hand good and
standard advice that matches uh guy
Kawasaki I think was the first one who I
heard say it um that you should only
invent products that you would use
yourself if you wouldn't use it why are
you trying to get somebody else to use
it right now the exception to that of
course would be some you know Industrial
thing that you would never use yourself
it's only for somebody else so there'll
be exceptions
but I think humor is an
exception because when I tell the story
about my uh travels from being a
cartoonist who was not successful to one
who was the biggest change was doing the
opposite of what Rick Rubin
suggests so I started out making Comics
that were entirely amusing to me only to
find out that I'm not like other
people or I'm not not I'm not like
enough other people so the things that
would be absolutely hilarious to me
other people would say ah that doesn't
really touch me you know I I I don't
relate to it that sort of thing and then
one day a uh experienced Cartoonist the
cartoonist who did the Family Circle or
circus or Circle I forget um
he told me I should make my cartoons for
other
people that that I should make them for
the audience and I got really mad
because he said it in front of a crowd
of people so you know it was I didn't
like where he said it they were my
customers um but it was the most useful
yeah Bill ke it was the most useful uh
professional advice I've ever gotten I
was in fact making Comics that I liked
and they weren't going anywhere as soon
as I said to myself well what would they
like and then paying attention to the
feedback everything took off
specifically here's what I
learned um let's say I've never worked
as an accountant which is true but I
know as a Cartoonist that if I make a
joke about the accountant that you're
dealing with you're probably going to
like it if I execute it right
so that's an perfect example so I would
do a lot of jokes that were about
somebody in a particular job or a
particular boss employee situation that
you could relate to if I can make you
relate to it then the bar for making it
funny was lower because you would laugh
at anything you relate to basically so I
learned that if I could make something
that you relate to then I can be
successful if I make something that I
can relate to and man is so funny to me
yeah 10% 10% of the public says yeah
yeah I get that so uh while I have no
doubt that Rick rubin's uh advice makes
sense within the domain that he's worked
primarily in music I can see that I
think the Beatles were an example of
that they literally just said that
sounds good so we'll put it in there if
it sounded good to them they made it and
and of course it worked
I just don't think it's a universal and
I don't know if cartooning is the
exception uh Rick also mentioned that
it's one reason that movies are so bad
because the movies are being made for
the public the public is presumed to be
dumb and only want to see chase you know
uh car chases so they make bad movies I
would I have a slightly different take
on that I don't think that has to do
with giving the audience what they
want I think it has to do with the
people who have the money think that's
what makes
money so if you need money to make your
movie you got to get it from somebody
who says yeah it needs to have a car CH
scene you got to have somebody tied to a
chair your hero has to change you know
they're going to tell you it's got to me
hit all these
notes
um but I don't think that's what the
artists want I think the director wants
to do something that they like so movies
are kind of a hybrid where you don't get
to do what you want you have to you have
to do what the money people want you to
do so but anyway so I think Rick Rubin
is one of the most brilliant people in
the creative field so he has a new book
out and I recommend it I haven't read it
but if Rick Rubin wrote it and it's
about how to make something work I
definitely recommend
it because he's one of the smartest
people out there all right that ladies
and gentlemen is my prepared remarks I'm
going to talk privately for a few
minutes to the locals subscribers so
