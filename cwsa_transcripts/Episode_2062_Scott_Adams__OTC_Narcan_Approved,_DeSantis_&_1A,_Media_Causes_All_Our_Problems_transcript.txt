good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization you might notice that I've
got a little bit of laryngitis today
so I'm going to take it easy with my
voice I don't think I'm sick I don't
know what it is I think I just maybe
enjoyed myself too much or something
but
today your experience is going to go up
a level uh I mean you won't even believe
it
it'll be hard to believe anyway and all
you need is a copper mugger glass attack
or else it's time the canteen jug of
flaska vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called this simultaneous sip go
ah allow me to share with you my
personal phobia
which I didn't know I had until just now
some of you know my story
that some number of years ago I lost my
ability to speak
through something called the spasmodic
dysphonia made my vocal cords go nuts
when I talked what you might not know is
that we are private well you might not
know is that typically when people get
that condition it starts with a normal
um a normal what do you call this uh
you can't talk
what's it called when you can't talk
uh why am I blanking on that
laryngitis yeah it starts with a normal
laryngitis just from some normal kind of
bug or something
but if you if you try to talk past the
uh laryngitis
you can trigger yourself into permanent
voice loss
which is what happened to me now I got
mine reversed by surgery but I don't
want to reverse I don't want to trigger
it again
so I'm not going to push my voice
but uh it's all just sort of get through
today and then rest it for the rest of
the day
so uh
that's what I have to worry about today
is not overextending my voice
so I might sound a little bit like NBR
today
would you mind if I do the entire live
stream like NPR
let's see what that would look like
Nashville police
released the body cam footage
the body cam footage shows the police
doing an excellent job
would you like that
that put you right to sleep all right
well this is the story
um the only reason I mention this is
because we spend so much time
criticizing law enforcement
and when you see law enforcement do
something that to me looked exactly
right
the Nashville police taking out the the
school shooter
and I have to admit when you see the
body cam
it restores your faith in the police
you know because you see a bunch of
anecdotal stories about somebody who
didn't do something right
and it just so you sort of Imagine
that's everybody
because you see a few anecdotes you're
like oh that's what the police are but
then you see this bunch of police who
were both Fearless running toward the
the shots and very effective the moment
they made contact they they ended the
threat
I I don't know what to say about this
except it was perfect
so congratulations to the Nashville
police for making uh law enforcement in
general look good I think
uh well here's an interesting story
New York Post
there are a bunch of researchers in
Australia who designed a nasal spray
that's like Viagra
so I think it's different chemistry but
it's a nasal spray instead of a pill
and
the thing that makes it work well
microphone's fine the thing that makes
it work well is that because it's a
nasal spray it doesn't have to go
through your bloodstream it gives you
full results in five minutes
it's like spray boom you're ready to go
now
if that were the only story in the news
I'd say well that's that's an
improvement they've done something good
here
but there's another story
that seems totally unrelated but maybe
not the FDA approved Narcan for
over-the-counter sales
now Narcan is what you get if you have a
fentanyl overdose if somebody has an
archaean they stick it in your nose and
it's like a nasal spray spray it up your
nose and apparently it works so well it
can just take you back from almost the
Dead
so one of the problems of course as you
can see these two stories intersect is
that
what if you get those two confused
yeah you don't want to you don't want to
grab your uh
erectile dysfunction spray when you
wanted the Narcan
and
if the if the bottles are not labeled
appropriately
there is a way to tell
so if you give somebody the Narcan spray
and the only change five minutes later
is a raging erection
go look for the other bottle
right
um
so what you don't want is somebody to
die with a raging hard on
um because my understanding is that
that's embarrassing if it's an open
gasket you know what I mean
if it's an open casket you're like what
are we going to do about that
because I think the rigor mortis
sets in about the same time as the as
the erectile dysfunction so you could
die with a
wall saluting and uh then they probably
just have to make some adjustments now
depending on your
size I guess they'd make some
adjustments to the casket top make one a
little extra deep sort of thing I don't
know I'm just thinking through all the
possibilities I don't think it's a big
risk
but you know it's good to it's just good
to make sure you've covered all your
bases
the question I ask is why did it take so
long for the FDA to improve this
why did it take so long for the FDA to
approve this
I think we've known for a long time this
was a good play
I knew it I'm not in the FDA but yeah I
mean I suppose there were some testing
and they were waiting for some data
I don't know it feels like too much of
an emergency situation
to have not done something about it
earlier
so I can't be happy about the speed of
that but at least it happened
and by the way
I would like to congratulate
all of you because I do think that
public opinion has some influence on
this don't you
and certainly you know my audience has
been pushing for it as I have for
two years how long have we been pushing
for this two years
and
you know I'm not I'm not going to say it
wouldn't have happened anyway because
it's just a good idea but I do feel like
if you're putting pressure on something
that ends up happening
you can claim that you were part of the
productive process I think we were I
don't know that it made a difference but
we were we were certainly pushing in the
right direction and you should be proud
of that because I think it I think that
proves you were on the right path and
you were advocating for the right stuff
so good for you
um
Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak and a bunch
of other Tech leaders have signed a
petition I guess or a letter
uh asking for AI development to pause
for six months
pause immediately for at least six
months the trading of AI to not make
anything more powerful than the current
version
and the it's because of the risks to
society
what do you think of that do you think
it's a good idea
to pause AI development until we have a
robust monitoring you know some kind of
a human system for maintaining it
yeah yeah
[Laughter]
I I'm gonna say yes
unambiguously to that there are very few
things which I can say you know I agree
100 percent
this is one of them
this this is one of them and here's the
argument the argument goes like this
pausing for six months probably won't
hurt us would you agree pausing for six
months probably won't hurt us
but it could save civilization
now if you say to yourself Scott it's
going to get out anyway there's nothing
you can do you could try to control it
but it's too late I agree
I agree that there's a really good risk
or high risk that there it's too late
some people said well I can already
download it onto my local device I could
keep trading it there's nothing you can
do
but
I would point out
do you remember when it was
that the internet was new
and all the people who were in charge of
copyrights and books and stuff they all
said oh no publishing will go away
because everybody will just steal it and
put it on the internet
so there's no way to have a business
model when the moment you make something
is just stolen and on the internet now
that's the current situation
the current situation is you know all of
my work all of my work gets stolen and
putting on the internet immediately
almost the moment it's created
but it never hurts
because the law was still robust and
it's still still illegal to you know to
routinely put my work on the internet
lawyers would come get you so I would
say you should not underestimate
how comprehensive the law could be
if the law tried to make AI illegal I
think it could do it
I think it could
that doesn't mean people wouldn't cheat
but if you're cheating sort of locally
you know if you're not Google
and you're not you're now some giant AI
you know company
you're not going to do too much in your
bedroom you know with your local
computer
I think you only have to worry about the
big entities and the big entities can be
completely controlled
right Google is not going to violate the
law
they have too much at risk so I think
you underestimate how effectively the
law could shut down AI
I think you're seeing the beginning of a
movement that's going to be chipping at
AI from every direction
until it's almost completely neutered
so my guess is that AI is far too
dangerous
for the right reasons and the wrong
reasons
the right reasons that AI is dangerous
is it might teach us what's real
if the if America ever found out what
was real
and what was the whole system
would collapse
because our system is depends on people
believing stuff that isn't true
AI could change that so our whole system
could be at risk just from the truth
then that's just one risk you know if
you imagine all the other worst case
risks they're pretty amazing now
I am opposed
to stopping AI permanently
I I think it's necessary I think you
don't want China to have it before we do
but I do think it makes sense to be
really really serious about safety
I think the net effect of that
is AI might have a military use and
almost nothing else
because we'll neuter it in so many ways
now what happens when AI starts taking
jobs
don't you think there will be
legislation
to make it illegal to replace a human
with a machine
now we've been replacing humans with
machines for you know 100 years
or more but once they can replace all
the humans
I think we're gonna have to rethink it
so here's what I think is going to
happen in the medium term
I think there are too many humans who
are incapable of taking care of
themselves
more so than ever probably
because in the old days you could at
least be a farmer you know or work on a
farm but today they're they're just huge
segment of the population
there really isn't capable of doing
anything in the modern world they don't
have any capabilities whatsoever they're
a commercial
so I think we're going to have to create
two civilizations
one who lives on some kind of Ubi and
maybe the robots do the hard stuff for
them and they just take them away from
everybody else because there'll be crime
ridden and you know low bad mindsets and
it'll be every problem in the world but
they won't want to work
so take the people who don't want to
work or can't work because they don't
have capabilities put them in one place
and try to try to get the people who
still have something to add
physically separated from them
yeah because at this point there there
is a poisonous mindset and there's still
a productive mindset and they're living
simultaneously
I feel like when I grew up in America
there was only one mindset
is anybody in my age range that would
concur with that you know that whole
image of the American dream that was
pretty much a hundred percent
like I don't think anybody disagreed
with that
um
you know it wasn't even even
generationally people agreed you know I
went through the the hippie hippie
generation and it looked like the
hippies were you know anti-work and you
know
anti-establishment but really as soon as
they wanted money they became pretty
establishment
so that was more of more of a youth
difference
but today we've got so many different uh
opinions about everything
that our operating system is dissolving
I wasn't going to talk about this yet
but well let me add this first
there's another study Stanford
researchers tried to figure out if AI
could change your mind on politics
better than a person could so they did a
trial where a person would write
something to change your mind and then
AI would write something to change your
mind and they found out that the AI
beat the people AI was more persuasive
in its arguments than people not a lot
you know maybe like in the two percent
range something like that
but as the article I read pointed out on
the big issues of the country two
percent is a pretty big deal I mean that
could be the difference between passing
and not passing
or elected or Not Elected now here's
what I would add to that
as far as I know
no one has ever trained AI
in the techniques of persuasion
so far everything I've seen it looks
like it writes
the way a good writer would write but
not with any of the deep techniques of
persuasion just sort of ordinary
communication good practices what
happens
if AI learns hypnosis
so for example
I ordered a deck of cards that each has
a hypnosis trick on it
so it's like 50 or so cards each one has
a specific trick the AI could learn very
easily right they're just use these
words instead of these words very easy
stuff
if if AI if I trained it just with that
deck of cards I wish I could I forgot
the name of the
company or person that makes the cards I
want to give them a shout out because I
bought the cars Mike Mandel thank you
Mike Mandel he's a hypnotist and I just
saw his cards advertised on the internet
and I thought oh I'll get those see what
that's all about
so I got the Mike Mendel
is it Mandel or Mandel Mandel so I got
the Mike Mandel hypnosis cards
and I was looking through them and sure
enough
they're actually useful
completely powerful tips on how to word
things more persuasively
all you'd have to do is sit down with
the AI because I believe it has memory
now you can train it and say hey AI I'm
going to teach you 50 tricks to be more
persuasive
remember these tricks and then I'd like
you to write a persuasive argument using
whichever of these tricks makes sense in
this document
and then how persuasive would it be
you really have to worry about that see
there I have a unique window into a risk
that most people don't see which is the
techniques of persuasion
I can see the AI doesn't have them
it's obvious that it doesn't have the
techniques but they're so easy to learn
and they're so powerful
all you have to do is expose it to him
once
you're done
and
I don't think anybody in the government
has a full appreciation of that like
even people like you know Elon Musk and
Steve Wozniak some of the smartest
people who have ever you know
drawn a breath but do you think they
have a unique understanding of
persuasion and persuasion tools
I don't know I mean they know a lot of
stuff they might
but I doubt it I doubt it
so that's a big risk all right
um
I love watching CNN reporting on Fox
News
because it's always so biased and they
like to slip in their fake news in the
sentence that just otherwise seems
innocuous
so you just assume that the fake news is
real because the rest of the sentence
seemed pretty reasonable all right
here's an example
if you're following the Fox News and
Dominion lawsuits
here's what CNN says about it now this
isn't just as part of a larger article
but this is just one sentence that I
want to call out for amazing weaselness
all right here CNN CNN website says
uh but that was several weeks ago before
Dominion Unleashed a trove of
embarrassing text messages and testimony
from Fox Executives and personalities
that suggested they knowingly aired at
Trump's false claims about the 2020
election
huh
did that happen
in the real world did that happen
no no that didn't happen
but they just put it in a sentence like
like well we all know this happened
just sort of obvious has happened
now let me let me be more specific when
I say it didn't happen there is no
smoking gun
in in the Dominion lawsuit because we've
seen the texts that are the most
embarrassing
the most embarrassing ones
do not have any admission that they were
aware that Trump was wrong
how could they
how could anybody know Trump was wrong
you could know some of his specific
claims didn't hold up in court
I mean that's verifiable
but you don't know he's wrong
you can't prove a negative
so according to CNN yeah they can not
only read the minds of the people
but then they look at their writing that
does not say what they wanted to say it
does not say
we knew that he was lying and we acted
like we didn't know nobody said anything
like that they said stuff like this is
the content that are uh that our people
want to see
they've said in some cases that they
didn't believe the election was rigged
but that has nothing to do with whether
Trump believed it
you know the if Trump believed it that's
the news
then they were just reporting the news
yeah so I don't think that there's any
evidence that somebody knowingly puts
something on that they knew was false I
don't think that's an Evidence
so it always amuses me to see that and
see that it will just drop that in there
like it's a fact when it's not
um did you know that Ron DeSantis is
trying to make it easier to sue the
media if you're a public figure what do
you think of that
do you think that public figures
should be able to sue the media more
easily
I think that's a good idea
yeah
did I have any lawsuits there would be
it would probably end the media
do you think it's a good idea if you
knew it would put the news business out
of business
or that the news business would not say
negative things about people because
they might be afraid of getting sued
yeah the uh the First Amendment
would allow
you know anybody to say anything as long
as it's not you know knowingly malicious
but I guess the proposed change would
make it easier for the
for the public figure to sue
now let me ask you this
um the headline of almost every major
publication in the last
a month
ran a story about me
that painted me as a racist
was that an accurate story
it was a headline there was a headline
everywhere is that accurate
how many of them reported that I was
complaining about racists who didn't
like me
that the context was about other racists
and that those racists
didn't like me so I'd want to stay away
from those racists
did any of them report that
do you think that it cost me any money
Millions yeah millions and millions of
dollars
fake news
now
what I say is fake I only mean that they
left the context out that would have
reversed the meaning of the story it
wasn't fake that I said things that
other people say sound racist that was
true
but if you leave out the reason I said
it
it reverses the meaning
would I have a lawsuit
if Rodney census makes it easier for me
to sue do I have a suit
well some a lot of you are saying no
under the current rules I'd say no
under the current rules I'd say no
because you have to prove malice and it
would be too easy for them to say malice
I have no malice
I just thought that was true
right it's a it's an Ultimate Defense
what we thought it was true
we didn't look into it very closely but
we thought it was true on first you know
on the surface
I don't think I should be able to sue
for that
because if I did I'd put the entire
media on a business
I mean the the size the size of what
they did just to me
was enormous
just the size of it just put this think
of the scale of what they did to me just
the scale
is huge
now
you know there's a part of me that you
know always wants to set the world right
and you know get revenge or something
but I really don't think I should have
that right
I don't think that you would be served
if I could do that more easily
because it would just remove your news
they just wouldn't be able to have a
business model
that's what I think so I think uh
DeSantis is on some
uh Dangerous Ground here yet I
completely understand the motivation
you know having been a uh in the Target
zone for malicious media treatment
you know I understand it I just don't
think you can win that way
all right
um
so I feel like there's something
happening in the mindset or
something
here's a story that I don't know that I
would have seen
two months ago you tell me does this
sound like something that would have
been said two months ago
um so you know the story about Leah
Thomas the trans athlete who competes as
a woman and is beating most of the women
most of the time and of course
the women who are born as women say
that's unfair
they would say they're competing against
a biological male is what they say
but here's what's different
this uh Riley is it rightly gains
uh Riley Gaines who's a female born
female and a competitive swimmer and
she's coming out directly
and with she's not shading any of her
opinion she's just saying this is a man
we're competing against men this is bad
for women
and it's being reported at least by Fox
News and probably others just directly
what she says
have we reached the point where people
don't need to be so polite
because it seems like two months ago the
way she would have had to say this is
uh
Leah Thomas she they would have said she
in all cases two months ago she
is a problem for other women because
it's you know unfair or something but
you know we hope that she finds a place
to compete
and she is too strong for you know the
competitors and she makes it unfair
doesn't it feel like two months ago you
would have had to buy into the the
pronoun
but now she's just on the news saying
it's a man
I'm competing against a man
and that's not that's not fair for women
but but let me forget about the topic
for a moment right forget about the
topic
does it feel like she has more free
speech than even a few months ago
or is that my imagination because I
might be biased about this
yeah it feels like people are now saying
directly you're just men with mental
illness
people are saying that directly no no
this is not about wokeness this is
people with mental illness
who are trying to jump on a theme now
just to be clear
I think people are so different
and there's so many different kinds of
people with kinds of minds and
everything else I do think
that there are people who have some
general you know genuine situation where
the only thing that can make them happy
is gender reassignment
as adults kids kids is a different
situation of course
but
I don't think it should be illegal
for somebody to change their gender if
that's what they need because they're
adults and we're not in their bodies
we're not in their brains we can't make
decisions for them
but is it not clear that it's gone too
far
and is it not clear that it has
attracted people with just mental
illness
and that if we treat them mentally ill
the same as somebody who's just let's
say operating based on their freedom
this is somebody who says you know I
think this would make me happier and
then they do it it makes them happier
good for them
but I feel like Society has kind of
reached a limit
yeah it's too far
it's too far
and I think that
um
treating Leah Thomas
as a woman
would make sense in almost any other
context
if Leah Thomas wants to live that kind
of life
it's a free world I think people should
just do what makes them happy if it
doesn't hurt me
but once once that preference is taken
into this specific context of sports
um I don't have any problem with the
women who were affected by it saying
we're competing against men
to me that doesn't even that doesn't
even feel impolite not even a little bit
so I feel that that's a change
I feel that I feel like I would have
been canceled
just for this
am I wrong
even what I just said I feel like I
would have been canceled two months ago
but I don't feel like that's out of
Bounds at the moment I feel like we're
we're achieving some kind of clarified
understanding of the situation which is
it's not all about everybody trans is
good all the time
and it's definitely not everybody trans
is mentally ill
as long as we can get out of the binary
I think we'll be okay
it can be true that it's good for some
people and isn't it good that they can
do what they need to do and it could be
also true that the mentally ill have
taken over the category
to me it looks like it to me it looks
like a lot of mental illness
masquerading as something else
now that wouldn't be different from any
other any other topic would it in almost
every topic
there's somebody who's mentally ill this
being mistaken for like a legitimate
voice
take racism
you know there's all kinds of I'll call
it normal racism
but then there's crazy racism isn't
there
isn't there crazy racism wait a minute
that's not racism that's just mental
disorder that is just mental disorder as
soon as you call that racism
it just gets confusing you're getting
lost in the binary that people are
racist they're not racists you know that
little simplified world
and I I would say that almost every
major topic has some important people
who are involved who are actually just
mentally ill
and they get confused with the serious
people who just have different opinions
yeah well Greta is a good example Grant
is a good example now
Greta appears to be from the outside
somebody who's suffering from a mental
I won't say doesn't look like any
organic mental problem but it looks like
a mental condition
brought on by you know media forces
and there are probably a lot of young
people who have the same alarmist PTSD
feeling about climate change that they
better act now or they'll be dead in six
years we have left or whatever the crazy
number is
so
Greta to me
looks like somebody's suffering from
some kind of mental
issue which doesn't mean she's wrong the
question of whether she's right or wrong
is completely separate
it just doesn't look like that's the
motivation
from the outside I can't read her mind I
can't diagnose her you know you
shouldn't listen to anything I say about
anybody else's Mental Health
but
from the outside that's what it looks
like
liberalism is a mental disorder Michael
Savage says but again it's a matter of
degrees
being a being a moderate Democrat is
definitely not a mental disorder
does anybody think it is
does anybody think you know let's say
old Bill Clinton the old Bill Clinton
Democrat was at a mental disorder
you look like the most rational guy
we've ever had as a president to me
but certainly there are things that you
would call liberal or Progressive today
that in my opinion
they get in a little too far into Mental
Health
and not so much about politics
so I think it's a I think it's important
that we can call out mental health as a
variable
isn't it
and doesn't that move things forward
if you can say you know
yeah here's the other thing people like
me who are just tired of having to lie
I just got tired of lying
so I just started saying what I was
actually thinking
and of course you canceled is very very
expensive
but I don't have a moment of regret
and I feel like it's useful
for you to see people like me
who took a back full of arrows I don't
have a single regret
and maybe that's good maybe the system
needs people who are willing to you know
run at the pill box first
that just happened to be me this time
next time it will be somebody else
all right
um I have a theory that the media is the
root cause of all of America's current
problems
and I'm going to build this into a
bigger theme and it goes like this
um
the the the basis the basis of the I'm
going to talk about that chart the basis
of the hypothesis is this
that when
we got the internet
and we learned to be able to count the
number of clicks on a story which is the
first time we could know with certainty
every little Nuance of oh this headline
gets more clicks this story gives more
clicks which was a little bit harder to
deduce
back when the news was just on TV and it
was three people reading the news
but once you could tell exactly what
would get people excited which was
correlated with profits
then you had to chase you had to chase
the outrage
so once we monetized outrage
everything else came out of that
monetized outrage
so at this point the media is no longer
about the news it's about monetizing
outrage the news is just the ingredients
but the cake is outrage right they could
use those ingredients to inform us to
lift us up to Enlighten us but they
don't have a business model that would
support any of that crap so instead they
they surf as outrage because that's
where the bunny is
now as long as you have that system can
you have a healthy country
I would argue it's impossible
without changing something I'm not even
sure what needs to be changed but the
current situation is a fast road to
destruction
let me give you an example of some of
the things in my opinion
the media
is the sole reason for all of the
problems and if this doesn't shock you I
don't know I will
and before I read them I'll give you
this uh this backup
there's some graphs that just went by in
the locals platform because they can put
images in with their comments and I saw
that in Twitter it was uh since 2010
uh the media massively increased
headlines they use fear anger and
disgust and sadness
because those things get clicks and it's
it's a dramatic change around 2010.
2010 is you know roughly when we knew
exactly what worked and what didn't yeah
roughly iPhone time
so basically you can tell that this is a
click bait related phenomenon would you
agree that the timing in 2010
you know coincident with smartphones
ish you know around that isn't it
obvious
that the headlines turn negative because
of a technological Improvement it's
obvious right
like that that part nobody doubts I
don't have to defend that any more than
the obvious right
so once you have that situation where
the news is not trying to help they're
trying they're actually trying to hurt
they're trying to hurt you because it's
profitable and when I say hurt you I
mean give you bad news that doesn't make
you feel good and maybe there's nothing
you can do about it anyway
all right here are things I think the
news literally destroyed
traditional American values
and I want to say in your comments agree
or disagree the traditional American
values have been destroyed by the media
not just the news not just the news but
movies
Etc
now I'm not going to make an argument
that traditional American values are
perfect and the only thing we should
consider
because traditional American values
that's you know too much racism and
sexism and you know add other issues
lots of other issues
but when you are would you agree with me
that as an operating system for the
country it worked to keep cohesion even
with all of its problems it kept
cohesion and that cohesion was applied
toward you know Merit and hard work and
that's what built the country
the country was built on trust
you don't know how important trust is
which I believe is a religious
traditional value
right you don't get trust unless you
think God was watching
am I wrong
if you thought there's no God you would
just say well if I can get away with it
I can get away with it but if you think
you're going to burn in hell forever if
you lie to your business partner
you might be less inclined to do it well
I don't want to burn forever so I'll
tell the truth
so I think that the traditional American
values created an operating system for
the country that was super successful
and that the media
has chipped away on it and in recent
years usually for good reasons usually
for good reasons I love I love
inclusiveness I like diversity I like
getting rid of racism
so the reasons are all good
it's just that you don't indulge in
those until you're already successful
there's a certain type of
way of thinking that I don't think
emerges until you've taken care of all
your big problems
you know and got the country Solid and
then people have the luxury of you now
I'm not sure everybody should have a job
can you imagine those of you who are in
my age range imagine in the 60s well I
guess in the 60s they were saying that
but imagine in like the 80s
somebody's saying how about Ubi would
just pay people to do nothing
you couldn't even have that conversation
it would have sounded ridiculous
because people have said no that's not
the operating system as soon as you pay
people for not working you're going to
get more now working how's that not
obvious
so
I think you have to succeed and I'll
come back to this theme before you can
be silly silliness is like a a luxury of
the successful
and especially their children
the children of successful people have
the greatest luxury of all because they
don't know what it takes to make the
money
they just know they don't need any at
the moment
all right I think Traditional Values was
destroyed by the media not that it
shouldn't have
I'm just saying it happened
I think the January 6 Insurrection story
is completely media driven
and as the media had told us well it was
a bunch of people who were unhappy about
the election but yeah and there was some
violence and that's the end of the story
you know the media could have covered
that that way right
how did the media cover the protests
when Trump got elected the first time
first time Trump got elected to huge
protests
media covered it while it was happening
and then it's not a story anymore
but this January 6 won the media uh you
know being the winged monkeys of the
Democrats decided that this needed to be
the main story you see
so is this good for you is it good for
the country that the media decided
Insurrection which was literally not
what happened
is it good for the country that they
made up a narrative
and then sold it for two years no it's
terrible for the country
how about racial division do you think
racial division is being driven by media
narratives
of course of course
do you think do you think racial
division got worse on its own
no no if you leave people alone they
kind of
they kind of say oh you're my neighbor
oh you're cool
I like you
it's just when we get you know charged
up by the the media click bait stuff
I mean how unhealthy is it that we see
on Twitter every day there's a new story
of black people hurting other people
right there's no way that's
representative of course but if you see
that kind of video every day
it's going to make you think wow
everywhere I go it's going to be this of
course that's not the case how about our
Mental Health
of course
of course the media has destroyed our
mental health does anybody doubt that
does that seem obvious to you that
they've destroyed our mental health
because they're they're giving us PTSD
they're making us we're you know
racially afraid of each other just every
possible negative thing that's coming
from the means how about climate change
and the way we're addressing it but
let's say energy policy
probably the biggest economic factor in
the world is energy don't you think
we're doing everything wrong because of
the news do you know why we don't have a
robust nuclear
um
nuclear industry in America
it's the media
it's the media yeah if you took the
media away scientists would say well you
know we're good at this now and it's
safe the current models are safe
and if the media just reported that well
it turns out the current models are safe
that's it we would have a robust
france-like nuclear energy
but we don't and the media did that that
was the media
um how about uh Tick Tock and banning it
don't you think Tick Tock would already
be banned
it it's only the media
that even allows this to happen
um the whole story about trans athletes
do you think that Leah Thomas would be
uh competing if the media did not
support her
of course not of course not if the media
reported that a man was competing as a
woman
it would end immediately
it's just the way it's framed
the moment that all of the media
reported the story
there's a man
competing as a woman
which by the way is the only one way to
frame it the other way to frame it is
she's a woman and you know she has
advantages
but if the media decided that they
didn't want this to happen
they just say oh there's this man
competing as a woman and then everybody
would have no problem Banning it because
they know they'd be safe well the media
says there's a man competing as a woman
so obviously we can ban him they would
be able to say in that case from
competing
but right now the media says
that you know treat everybody according
to their gender preference and so if you
were to complain about it
the media is this you know has worked up
a bunch of people to complain about you
so that's a media problem how about uh
population decline
do you think the population in in mostly
industrialized countries do you believe
the population is declining because of
natural reasons you know just economics
or uh do you think the media has a lot
to do with it the media there are young
people who literally don't want to have
babies because of climate change
well betters a lot of them I bet there's
a lot of them and I don't see the media
saying having babies is good and Noble
and American and necessary
I don't even if there's an if there's a
media story about babies it's going to
be how they're too expensive
right yeah or people are way happy
without babies surprise we found that
women are happier without babies I've
seen that story
I've seen that story
I don't know how true it is but I've
seen that story how about uh the Ukraine
war
do you think we'd be at War if half the
country did not support it and do you
think half the country would support it
if the media had not told them to
now everybody's opinion this comes from
in the media all of it
so the only way you have a war is if the
media says it's okay
if if CNN and Fox News said this is
insane stay away from Ukraine you know
let whatever happens happens and by the
way that's not necessarily my opinion
I'm just saying that the media decides
if you're in war
is not the government the government
doesn't have the power to create a war
and sustain it without media support now
they only need half of the media
they don't need the left and the right
you either one would be enough
probably but they can't do it without
the media so the media creates our Wars
we wouldn't be in Ukraine with them
um
and that that was just the things that
that came to my head immediately
what about the bank run do you think
we'd have a bank run if the news covered
it differently
the bank run is completely a media
phenomenon it's not a banking phenomenon
it is a media phenomenon if the media
tells you the banks are failing they
will fail
if the media says oh this is one special
case don't worry about it
the banks will succeed
now they do have actual structural you
know issues of having enough reserves
and all that but I think those are the
problems we could figure out
the thing you can't figure out is if
everybody tries to withdraw their money
at the same time that you can't figure
out and the media is bringing us very
close
to the point where that's a risk I don't
think we're there but
try to try to think of any problem in
the world that's one of the big ones and
don't and see if you can see any problem
any problem that isn't isn't either
entirely caused by the media or
influenced in the wrong way by the media
it's actually everything
it's everything
all of our problems with the media do
you know why we don't talk about this
more
who would do the talking you're not
going to get invited by the media to
talk about the media being a bad
right so if it doesn't happen on
something like this an independent live
stream you're not going to hear it
so there's pretty much no issue that
isn't being destroyed by the media
and
uh here's a new poll Charlie Kirk
tweeted about this uh new Poll for
Newsweek shows that 69 percent of
Americans believe January 6 was less
violent than reported by the fake news
media just 26 26 percent believe it was
more violent than reported
that that spunky little 25 26 percent
they can get every question wrong
all right um
so here's my question
have you ever noticed that there are a
lot of ancient civilizations
that left advanced cities at least
Advanced by their standards uh that just
got covered with dirt
do you ever wonder about that
How uh
how is that that so many like buried
cities exist where there was once this
thriving City and now every single
person is gone and they've been gone so
long that the whole thing covered with
dirt so you didn't even know it was
there
now I assume there are a number of
reasons one of those reasons could be
you know economic
maybe there's a drought
well uh maybe there's a natural disaster
in in Central and South America maybe it
was smallpox that came in from Europe
so there's a bunch of reasons yeah
volcanoes Etc but collectively in my
opinion
they don't seem to explain all of it
now of course this is just a subjective
you know kind of a view but to me it
looks like there's something else that
wipes out with civilizations
and it does it reliably that's the
problem it's the reliable part like it
seems like they all get wiped out
you know it makes me wonder if there's a
common
there's a common theme
and here's what I believe
I believe if you have you know hundreds
of millions of humans running around
some of them will have philosophies and
mindsets that will drive them towards
success
where they could build a civilization
and some will not
some will have more tribal everything's
fine the way it is tomorrow is the same
as yesterday and then they would not
drive toward you know building
civilizations
but here's my hypothesis
that when there's a coincidental correct
mindset in some group of humans and
let's say early America was the perfect
example the early American mindset was
really really optimized for building uh
economics and civilization and so it did
so America America was sprang up from
that
but here we are highly successful you
know arguably the strongest Nation on
Earth at some point
and once you're the strongest nation and
you can feed everybody and all of your
major problems seem solved
then you have the luxury
of the useless people having a bigger
voice
the useless people or anybody whose view
would take you away from the mindset of
success
I call those the useless people now you
don't have that many useless people
until you're really successful
it's like the children of successful
people become the useless generation
because they don't know what they don't
know what it takes to succeed they just
sort of were born into a good situation
but but now they're sure that they have
good ideas and you should all listen to
them
narcissists mostly so my theory is that
every every successful civilization
requires a success mindset they can be
different right the success mindset for
let's say the crit Christian biased you
know traditional family would be
different from
I don't know let's say some early
Muslims civilization that was also
successful they would have different
mindsets but both of them optimized for
some kind of success but once that
successful civilization becomes strong
enough it breeds
the second generation of people who
didn't who don't get it and they think
they need to change the mindset to
improve it
so now we're seeing the the viruses
the Dei the CRT the ESG climate alarm
you know the the trans Stuff Etc and a
hundred percent of it is either
anti-population or anti-success
anti-merit anti-economics
anti-everything that worked
and here's my guess I bet that's what
happened to other civilizations
I'll bet that success breathes a useless
class the useless class gains power
because nobody thinks to stop them it's
just talk
right if you have freedom of speech like
oh they're just talking
they're just talking everybody gets to
talk but at some point that talking
becomes so toxic and corrosive that uh
uh I'm gonna pull myself back from
something I was just going to say right
there
um
but maybe I'll tell you later yeah
there's something I'm going to tell you
later the the locals people already
heard it because they get the special
stuff
but uh YouTube you're not ready for this
information so I'm going to hold back on
that
um I'll tell you later though I I just
have to wait
so I think that we're heading toward at
least America is heading toward a
civilization collapse that is directly
caused by the media
the media allowing the the mindset of
success that drove America to be
corrupted because they get more clicks
for that
right so the people complaining about
the system and protesting they're
causing clicks and then they get more
people because the media tells you
what's true and now the media is sort of
the winged monkeys of all the people who
have the anti-success mindset
they're the ones telling us that we're
uh the real problem is racism
is it
the the only reason we have a racism
problem is because
well not the only reason but the biggest
reason is because the media told us to
they told us what to think and here we
are
yeah
so I think we're actually heading toward
a Extinction event in America and
everybody can see it
would you agree
everyone can see it
but here's what I think is the good news
earlier when I said could you talk about
Leah Thomas in direct terms even two
months ago
but today you can
have you noticed that since I got
canceled the discussions about race have
expanded that might be just my
impression I don't know but I feel like
you can speak more freely
about race and gender
and more freely about mindset success
mindset
and I'm seeing I'm seeing a little bit
more of it emerge right it takes some
people to
you know basically get canceled
before people will take anything
seriously
so I think it can be saved but we are on
an Extinction path America is not that
we'll have it
not that we will be extinct but that if
we don't change direction I mean we're
running right toward the cliff as fast
as we can and I think that before we get
to the cliff these smart people will
emerge
I bring you back to an earlier story
about Elon Musk looking to
help us pull us AI
Elon Musk is not the media
Elon Musk is a dad
and in many ways he's a dad first
right you think of him as rich as guy
and SpaceX and Tesla and all that but I
think he's a dad first
I think he's a dad first and when he
says you know the dad of all dads says
you should pause AI
and then a whole bunch of other smart
people agree completely
that is useful
that is the solution to the media Elon
Musk by buying Twitter and restoring in
my opinion restoring free speech to
Twitter is
the biggest thing that's happened in
years
it's the biggest thing because only
Twitter
is like slightly free at the moment
and it might be you know with the help
of the internet dads and internet moms
it might be the thing that drives us
back to sanity
it might
but right now the media and the
Democrats in particular
are on a toxic March toward destruction
and the only counterbalance will not
come from the media is going to have to
come from Twitter and people like Elon
Musk and the people who are willing to
get shot down
so and I also think that some people uh
and I'll use my own example as
the uh the perfect example I guess
some of us are just done
some of us are just done lying
and here's the other thing
you can beat up white people for a long
time and white men in particular
you can beat up white men for a long
time
until you can't
that's all
you you can you can on white men as
long as you want
until you can't
until you can't
all right
um
here's the media again so this is this
was in the news today new research shows
that physical exercise has little mental
benefits
New York Post
that's right the media is telling you
that exercise
might not be good for your brain after
all
you pieces of
no that's not true you know
that's not true you know that's not
 true
you know that's not true you
know that
yeah and wine is good for you
wine is good for you
 you media
 you you're trying to kill us now
do you how many of you think that that's
true now here's what they did they
looked at all the studies and they
decided the studies were underpowered or
in some cases inadequate they did not
they did not prove that exercise is not
good for the brain they proved that
studies suck
here's how the news here's how this news
should have read
a study shows that studies suck that was
the only news
that's the only thing they proved they
looked at the studies and they said the
way you did all these studies is bad
that's good news I mean that's useful
news hey studies show that studies are
all bad
I I would like that but no do not tell
me the exercise doesn't help me think
because I know that that's not true I
 know that's not true
oh it really pisses me off I don't know
if you could tell but I'm really pissed
off about that
it could there be a better example of
the media trying to kill us
I mean this is like just trying to
 end the country
this is so wrong
so wrong
somebody says the author is fat
maybe I doubt it but maybe
um
anyway
let's see I think I have some more notes
I haven't ripped up yet
um is anybody following the story of uh
Netanyahu and Israel and some judicial
reforms
how many of you know the details of that
story
all right so you're I don't I'm not good
on the details but it looks important so
let me tell you what I know
so Netanyahu is prime minister
is trying to put through some
legislation that would give more power
to the government
and decrease the power of the judicial
system in Israel
does that sound like a good idea to you
if you didn't know anything else if
that's the only thing you knew does it
sound like a good idea
well it would depend if the judicial
system was out of control
right if the judicial system is truly
out of control
then maybe you could argue you need more
balance
I suppose I told you that the judicial
system
had grabbed some power for itself
not too long ago and what Netanyahu was
trying to do is claw back the power that
the judicial system initially claimed
for itself that was you know greater
than before now I don't think it's one
for one but in terms of just a Power
Balance it's a response
to a grab by the judicial system
and he's trying to you know grab back a
little bit which he would call balance
Maybe
and maybe maybe somebody else would call
a power grab yeah Joel Pollock is
reporting on this in Breitbart and
that's where I'm getting my updates so
here's what's uh important from the
outside
what would you think if you saw the
United States
Congress passing a law that seemed to
give them more power than the courts in
other words trying to take power away
from the courts wouldn't you reflexively
oppose that
just automatically
no you wouldn't
depends
yeah I guess the right answer is it
depends
but unless there was some like
National urgency
it just sounds like a bad idea
just on the surface but it doesn't make
it a bad idea
it doesn't make it a bad idea it just
means that on the surface it's the
scariest freaking idea I ever heard
oh the government wants to take power
away from the courts the Court's the
only thing that control the power of the
government and so the government would
like to take away the power of the only
thing that can control the power of the
government
I can see why the citizens are revolting
and I don't even think they need to know
the details
right but of course it's like everything
else it it became a left right thing
because the courts apparently
are more supportive of left-leaning
things in the government
if it's a conservative government is
more supportive of conservative things
so it's really just it has nothing to do
with the constitution in Israel has
everything to do with the left and the
right wanting to win
that's about it but
it's fun to watch
because you can imagine this situation
or something like it happening in in
America
so I think Netanyahu wisely uh put it on
the back burner because of public
response
but
you know interesting to watch
um I also saw that uh
did you know that there's a Gallup poll
showing that democrats favor
Palestinians over the Israelis for the
first time since the poll has been run
did you know that Americans are so
divided
that
that the left is favoring the
Palestinians and the right must be
favoring Israel I mean not completely
but you know by majority
now I'm not going to pick favorites
because there's you know good and bad
behavior by everyone everywhere so I'm
not going to get into the I'm not going
to call a favor here
well I am I mean I'm pro-israel I can't
hide that I'm very pro-israel but that
doesn't mean that the Palestinians have
no complaints is that fair
would you accept that as a balanced view
I'm completely pro-israel
but the Palestinians have some stuff to
complain about it's not baseless it's
not baseless
so but you know you need some kind of
balance there
um
I don't know that's pretty alarming that
we don't even agree on Israel anymore
all right
um
so it turns out that uh do you remember
that one
happy moment a few days ago where I was
saying my God
you think everything is so partisan but
it turns out our Congress can get things
done when it's important they can become
bipartisan when the country is at risk
and I saw that happening with tick tock
I was like oh my goodness finally some
bipartisan movement finally the the
Democrats the Republicans they're not
going to fight out fight over it like
it's you know some kind of left right
thing they're just going to do what's
right for the country and and there was
this bipartisan move to ban Tick Tock
and I thought wow
Golden Age here we come things are
looking good now
and then thanks to Tucker Carlson's
reporting
we learned that that was a trick
and there were there there's not a bill
to ban Tick Tock there's only a bill to
give the Congress more control over
social media in general
that's the opposite of what I want
that's not even close
yeah that was just a trick so
everybody everybody involved with this
now there may be more than one Tick Tock
bill
so I want to make sure I'm not throwing
the wrong people under the bus
but anybody who's
bipartisanly supporting this bill to
give them control over social media
 you
 you
I'm not even going to give you a
political or legal or practical opinion
on this
 you
right this is pure evil
or incompetence or completely not caring
about the citizens of the United States
this is so unacceptable
 you
that's all I've got to say about that
just you
all right
I guess I woke up with a little bit of a
attitude today
um
so you got that
yeah so apparently this uh the new
anti-tick-tock bill which doesn't
mention Tick Tock
um
it gives the government escorting to
Greg price in the Tweet says it gives
the government the ability to go after
anyone they deem as a national security
risk at which point they can access
everything from their computer to video
games to their ring light now I suppose
they could have done that anyway but
anything that gives the government more
power
over the people
without a specific threat
right just sort of generally we'd like
to have more power over you in this way
not cool
not cool
so let's hope that stops
well but at least the FDA approved
Narcan and there's going to be a good
boner spray too so that's the good news
um
oh I'm actually over the hour I was
trying to make this a short show
yes again
vdh and Vivek agree with you on our
destruction yeah yeah I think
um here's one of the things I love about
Vivek ramaswamy
I love the clarity
with which he presents his opinions
that is so good for the country so good
whether he wins or loses he's a pure
Patriot
at this point is a pure Patriot what
he's doing looks like it's expensive for
him he's going to take a lot of hits and
it appears purely good for the country
in the sense that it expands our you
know productive conversation about
everything
and I could not say enough good things
about what he's adding to the process
right now he's adding a lot
and I think he's going to make Trump
stronger I think he'll make the
Democrats have to up their game
hopefully in the in a productive way
so I don't know if he's going to win or
lose and I and by the way I don't agree
with everything he says but that's also
not necessary right if he says what if
he says his view clearly backs it up
with his reasoning and I still disagree
with him
I'm cool with that that's a good
situation I just want to see good
arguments uh without any like and he
seemed he provides that he provides so
far
all I've seen is complete honesty
and he's not pulling any punches
and he's such a good communicator that
every topic he touches gets better
that's that's my view everything he
touches gets better
through his clarific you know clear
language basically
uh he's I think he he made his money in
Tech I believe
uh don't let your thoughts get divided
against Trump
here's what I'm going to do
with talking about Trump
I think everybody knows who he is right
so there's not really any explaining
that needs to be done about Trump
he's just such a well-known entity at
this point that I don't really need to
change anybody's opinions about anything
you know I wouldn't feel any impulse to
even try so I think at this point the
the best way for me to talk about Trump
is the warts as well as the benefits
do you think that's fair
if I cover what I don't like about his
let's say his campaign
but I also cover what I like
everybody okay with that
because you know he's not exactly a
Flawless candidate
but but people understand that it's
transparent
Trump's flaws are so transparent like we
all see them the the funniest
conversation I have with the Democrats
we'll see if any of you have the same
experience the funniest conversation I
have is when they remind me of the bad
things he's done
and they think that's a reason that I
shouldn't want him to be president again
and I look at the list of bad things
he's done and I say I know about all
those
I know about Trump University
yeah I I've heard of that I've heard of
Stormy Daniels
I know all of that I still think he's
the best choice
probably I mean we'll we'll see what the
candidate situation shapes up as I can
change my mind now my first choice would
be Vivek because he's younger
I don't know if he has a if he has a
path because Trump's position is so
dominant it's hard to say but I think I
could be consistently saying that I'd
prefer Vivek at the same time I can say
Trump brings a set of benefits that
the country needs as well
my my biggest concern with Trump is that
he brings so much controversy that we
get lost in that
if the only thing we could get is you
know Trump's policies like on energy for
example
that would be cool but what he brings is
so much consternation from the other
side that you can't get anything done
and that's got to be part of the
analysis you know it's not his fault
entirely you can argue It Is by this
more of a media phenomenon
on the other hand do the Dem do the
Republicans not get to have their first
choice just because the media won't like
it that's not a good enough reason to
keep him out of office
so we'll have to deal with that I guess
he isn't owned you know that does seem
to be the case doesn't it
could you say at this point that no
matter what you liked or didn't like
about Trump
do you feel that he was owned by anybody
because I'm actually curious
I feel like now
I feel like now
yeah
owned by his ego somebody says well
we're all owned by our own egos
I
um
you say he's not owned but he's
manipulated well
I don't know
manipulated
you know one of the things you hear
about Trump is that he can change his
mind
you know who was it was saying that that
Trump will listen to an argument and
then listen to the next argument and
then you know change his mind to the new
argument
I want more of that not less of that
that's being presented as a like a flaw
the ability to change your mind with a
better argument is sort of an advantage
sort of an advantage now if it's a bad
argument and it changes his mind that's
a problem but he does seem pretty good
at spotting BS
so we'll see oh yeah Kimberly Guilfoyle
said that
all right
um
you know if if uh Trump
somehow I don't know goes to jail or
collapses in the
in the primaries
I've got a feeling that Vivek is your
emergency spare so I would keep him
totally inflated if you know what I mean
like I If you're a Republican
you should have a backup plan to Trump
because Anything could happen you know
part of its age right you know anything
could happen
uh
but there could be you know some legal
thing you didn't see coming anything so
I
I would say you know even if Vivek is
your first choice
you realistically Trump's you know
leading the pack but he could
self-destruct pretty easily
or somebody could destroy him easily
could happen
I don't think it will I think the odds
are that Trump will sail right through
and you know be in the general election
but you have to be ready for that
um
here's my current view on DeSantis
running
these smart people
seem to have reached a general agreement
and it goes like this
if he runs in 2024
DeSantis will be so destroyed by Trump
that he might be done forever
he might be done forever but if he just
continues to do a solid job in Florida
as you know the country's most beloved
conservative governor
then Trump will not be able to run in
2028
DeSantis is Young
it's the obvious play
the obvious play is to wait it's really
really obvious and I would say that a
hundred percent of the smart people
are now understanding that now before we
got close to the primary
we have the luxury of just looking them
as two candidates oh if I were to
individually look at DeSantis huh he
seems to have a lot of trump-like
qualities without the drama and people
like him and huh okay that's all good I
love that you look at Trump separately
and you know about Trump but as soon as
you imagine them competing
and then this is the important part
you haven't even seen Trump power up yet
Trump is still running at like half
power you know compared to where he will
be he started wearing a half power and
he's already taken the legs out of
DeSantis
he just keeps repeating his claims about
DeSantis and just repetition alone is
making him sink in
because you always talk about it you
know if if Trump says something bad
about DeSantis is a national headline
forever
right everybody knows Ron de
sanctimonious everybody knows so
as soon as you imagine the primary being
a competition you imagine Trump
destroying your favorite politician if
he is
and you think well I'd rather save my
favorite politician and then get
you know 12 years of Republicans somehow
uh what's the sticky one
is
I missed it all right that's all for you
today uh YouTube I'm going to talk to
the locals people a little bit more
thanks for joining
best show you've ever watched
bye for now
