on my phone
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams today the
special June teeth Edition happy
Juneteenth and if you'd like to take
your Juneteenth up to all new levels of
Awesomeness all you need there's a
couple of mug or a glass of tanker
jealous of Diana canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip go
ah
yeah
well I have to admit it was only a few
short years ago that I learned what
Juneteenth was
never heard of it
was not anything I learned about but
given now my understanding it's the last
day of slavery in the last state I think
it was Texas it had it I say that is
very celebratible
Freedom's always celebratible and
that seems to me like a good celebration
so let's celebrate freedom
uh it is however not a work holiday for
cartoonists
do any of you get today off
is anybody taking the day off
or does it not work that way it's not
it's not a
it's not a national holiday right
yet
probably will be
I feel like June is a little light on
holidays
are you with me do you feel like June
just yeah they could use just a little
bit more holiday not enough holidaying
going on in June
I mean there's my birthday and that that
does cover a lot of the month
all right let's talk about uh blinken's
trip to China uh gigantic failure of
course
uh let's see he asked them if they would
stop Fentanyl and they said nothing
asked them if he would uh ask Johnny if
they would agree not to give deadly
weapons to Russia
which they've been saying all alarms so
that was nothing new
and then he asked them if they'd like to
have like an emergency
deconfliction phone call sort of like a
like the the red phone or the hotline to
the Kremlin and China said nah
[Laughter]
no seriously we should have like a
special phone call for deconflicting so
we don't have an accidental nuclear war
president XI yeah
yeah you have my number
call me if you need anything
so I would say that was a big old
nothing but uh blinken's concept and
apparently Biden's concept is that you
need to you need to be continually
dealing with the Chinese because there's
a better chance of getting a good
outcome if you're talking
if you're talking
I completely disagree with this
and I'll tell you what I would do I
would close all of our embassies and
send every Chinese student home
unless they fix Fentanyl
because the problem here
let me explain how government works to
the government
is that they've treated fentanyl like
it's just one other problem
it's not
it's not like any other problem
well we're we're at we're acting like
friends and all is on our list of
negotiating topics
you know when we go to talk to them
about uh trade
and our trade in the situation let's
throw fentanyl in there
because that's just another that's just
another thing to negotiate right
just throw it in there with the list you
got uh we got this and that and that and
then a little fentanyl let's talk about
that too
no
no
fentanyl is not like anything else on
the list
is not
you don't go into a negotiation with
somebody who's shooting your family
members while you're negotiated
do you
no you say first you stop shooting my
family members
and then we'll have something to talk
about
but you don't you don't act like
everything's business as usual while
they're killing your family
but we are
now autobind business as usual if we're
worrying about you know a trade War
that's yeah that's just business
but if they're killing people
right now
you don't negotiate nor do you keep your
embassy open you close your
Embassy and you say we'd love to talk to
you but you're going to stop this first
period
period and and the fact that this is
just put on the list with other stuff
it's like oh we'd like you to do this
and that and we'll just throw that on
the list to you maybe if we'd someday
talk about all of it together in some
comprehensive way no
no
you close the embassy
you just walk away and say you want
nuclear war you're on the way
you're on the way
because it is a war it's a hot war and
acting like it's not is ridiculous
so Lincoln total failure I'd like to
also say this about his name
when you're going to send somebody to
negotiate with your biggest adversary
would you like the last name of the
person who does your negotiating
to be Trump
or blinken
he went into the negotiation and he was
well he was blinking
but the other guy went into the
negotiation and Trump he trumped him he
dropped him
we should at least get the right the
names right
all right the big news everybody's
talking about it on the internet today
is that uh uh Joe Rogan challenged a
noted
vaccine pro-vaccine scientist guy named
uh Dr Hotes I think from from Sega right
h-o-t-e-z I think hotels maybe
and uh
Dr hotez Who I'd never heard of before
how many of you had ever heard of Dr
hote's prior to
this situation with Joe Rogan
okay a lot of you had all right this is
a real good example of the news bubble
because I saw some compilation clips of
Dr Hotes on CNN and MSNBC
where apparently he's been a number of
times
but I don't remember ever seeing him on
Fox News
so he's sort of a bubble situation yeah
so he's probably been one of the darling
Experts of the political left but the
political right probably just froze him
out because he wasn't really on message
for them so the big story is that RFK Jr
has a number of criticisms of
vaccinations in general but also the
covet ones specifically and
and uh would like to debate Dr Hotes on
Joe Rogan or at least Joe Rogan would
like them to debate and a number of
people were putting up money for charity
if they would debate and uh Dr Hotes
seemed to be hesitant but now he's
speaking out about it and he tells us
that a debate would be uh
bad
meaning it wouldn't be useful might even
make things worse
what do you think of that do you think a
debate see is it his issue and let me
give you more detail on his issue his
issue is among other things
that debate doesn't work because that's
not how science works right science
doesn't work
on the best debater wins
would you agree
that's not how science works and as he
points out science works with you know
peer-reviewed papers and experimentation
and you know all the processes of
science so he he says you know you
should do the scientific stuff
nothing debating stuff because the
debate stuff is about persuasion and as
he points out
well what what if the person who's wrong
this is I'm not paraphrasing I'm I'm
boosting his argument what if the person
who is wrong is the most persuasive
does that serve you would the public be
served by the person who is the most
wrong having the best argument
that's an interesting point
and he points out and Mark Cuban is well
that RFK Jr is very persuasive
and though he is an expert at persuading
on this topic and uh he's so good
that he's in the conversation to be
maybe leader of the whole country
like that's that's about his highest
level of persuasion as you could achieve
and so if you're a scientist who does
does work on TV but you're not really
the media expert like RFK juters is it
fair
to put in his words the strong argument
with the less persuasive person on the
same venue do you think that would serve
the public
I'm just going to go more with his
argument then we'll talk about the other
side
um and I think he makes a good point
that science is not about rhetoric and
persuasion
right
that's not what science does it's not
it's not a persuasion field
but I would argue as I have in the past
that if it doesn't
also learn to persuade honestly not not
persuade dishonestly but if science
doesn't learn to persuade honestly
it actually becomes useless
oh what good is it if you can't persuade
anybody to believe you it takes the
entire value of science off the table oh
yeah it's a good study I don't believe
it
um
let's see
then the other complaint is that RFK Jr
has a
habit of moving the goal posts
meaning Dr Hotes believes that once he
Nails him down and makes his good points
that instead of just winning the debate
then RFK Junior would just change it to
another thing and he gave some examples
of that he actually gave some specific
examples of where in his mind RFK Jr
used to make a claim of you know some
element of the vaccinations being bad
but then he changed it to well they're
still bad but maybe it's something else
then still bad but maybe it's a
different thing and then still bad but
maybe it's for a different reason
which is a good point
perfectly good point now did Dr Hotes
make good points which are true
good points which are true and logical
yes he did those are true in logical
points
yeah those are true and logical it's
true that that people like to move goal
posts it's probably true that RFK Jr has
modified his opinion over time
probably true it's probably true that
the most persuasive person
if they had the worst argument that
would be a problem
the most persuasive person with the
worst argument definitely would not move
the ball forward
but here's where I have my problem with
Dr hotes's problem with the debate
you don't think you could find a way to
manage that stuff
you don't think you could find any way
to structure a conversation where you
take it take that into account because I
can it took me five seconds to figure it
out here's how you do it
you say RFK Jr you're making some claims
that are you know contrary to the
established science
make three claims no more than three
make three claims of fact
and we'll present them to Dr hotels with
you know a week or two in advance
we're going to have him collect all of
his sources that debunk it
and we're going to show him all of your
sources that make the claim
after he's collected all of his sources
that you know debunk yours
before the debate he's going to show you
his sources that debunk your sources
so that when you both go into the debate
you've seen the sources and you've also
seen the other side's debunk of your
sources and maybe even the response to
the debunk
before the debate
you limit it to three claims and then
you have a Joe Rogan or somebody who
could actually handle an MMA
calling an MMA fight which by the way
could that be more perfect
that Joe Rogan is literally part of his
talent stack includes uh calling of
fights
and yeah who would be I mean it was just
is it just such an interesting talent to
have to go into moderating a debate that
you're actually at MMA you know fight
announcer type guy
uh
so the the task would be this
that every time either one of them tried
to move the goal post or either one of
them sort of got off topic or did sort
of a B2 or brought up something else
about something else it would be Joe
Rogan's job to just stop and stop him
just okay stop
stop
you're you're outside the rules now
you're changing the topic go back get
back to the topic
three points
through whatever whatever RFK is best
three points are whatever they are
because remember how I told you to deal
with laundry list persuasion
which is what RFK Jr does really well by
the way it you know it's a little bit
I want to say it's
dishonest but not exactly dishonest
because there's not necessarily A Lie
involved
it's persuasion that's beyond what it
should be I guess that's what I said a
laundry list of oh all these reasons is
why I'm right like a long list of
reasons looks persuasive before you've
looked at any of the reasons
oh my god there are 10 reasons 10
reasons is way more than one so that
must be a good argument there are 10
reasons
so that's why people use the laundry
list it just automatically looks true
before you even look at it
so I do believe that RFK Jr has a
laundry list approach which is let me
tell you 15 things I know about 15
different vaccinations therefore the
16th one is bad
no he never said that but you know you
understand that how the laundry list
could be then sort of generalized beyond
what it's supposed to do
so
as long as you can say RFK Junior make
your three best claims because if you
can't defend your three best
does anybody need to look at the others
right
if he can't defend his three best claims
his three strongest claims if he fails
on those you don't really need to listen
to the others
do you now there may be somebody else
who has a good argument for the others
but if somebody fails on their top three
their best points
you don't need to listen to anything
else
so I would say that the easy way to go
forward is to say three topics make sure
you've both shared all of your sources
both the source and the debunks make
sure you both have seen all of your URLs
and all of your sources
and then come on and talk to us with no
end to the conversation so you won't
have a timed end you don't want somebody
to run out and then you might schedule a
follow-up
make sure it's a it's a two event
situation one is the event
and then maybe a faster follow-up it's
like okay you know people thought you
won or people thought you want or the
the audience really was obsessed over
this one point you made can you go back
to that
then I think we'd have something
now I agree that debate is not how you
solve science
I get that I mean the Dr hote's
arguments are logical and true
but they don't really handle the fact
that you could manage those problems so
that's what's left out
it's true that he's identified the
problems
quite accurately
it's not true that there's no way to
handle those problems to minimize them
until you've got something useful to do
now suppose somebody took all of my
excellent ideas that I just gave you
put them together they do the event and
it just doesn't work
what would be your conclusion from that
it just that didn't work
no my conclusion would be you keep
trying
so maybe maybe one of the participants
is weak for whatever reason and then you
say all right well one of you is strong
one of you kind of couldn't handle this
this debate concept so we'll bring in
another one we'll bring in your your
best Champion that isn't the one who
failed
and that could be on either one not not
just the scientist could be the
anti-vaccination person is a different
person by the way let me correct that
it is unfair to call RFK Jr
anti-vaccination you all get that right
everybody agree
that is not of that is not an accurate
characterization of him but we we use
that as a shorthand to say that he's a
Critic of much of what we do with
vaccinations but very important it's
very important to make that distinction
because if you're just anti-vaccination
you're probably just an idiot
right that's probably the whole story
but but if you're saying well it looks
like some of this worked
and but other stuff I have questions
then you're talking to a reasonable
person that you could probably work with
right but if somebody's just like every
everything you put in your arm is bad
because firm is bad I don't you can't
really work with that
um
RFK Jr is never going to be satisfied
with vaccine safety good
that sounds like good news
to have him never satisfied with don't
you watch the people out there who are
never satisfied with the safety
that feels like the best situation of
all
uh yeah so RFK Jr is a apparently a
high-end good qualified
lawyer on these various topics so I
think he's won some cases he knows how
to dig into the science pretty well but
he's not a scientist I'd like to see him
talk
now
um
let me test you so you heard my
suggestion
three claims and then let them share
their sources before they even get into
the debate and then make sure there's a
follow-up already scheduled
so that the follow-up you know cleans up
any problems how many of you think that
that would be worth trying
let's see your comments
right you see a lot of yeses on the
locals platform a lot of yeses right and
and would you agree with me that if it
failed
you should try again
just tweak it and try again because this
is the model we need
the model we need is some version of
this if the first version doesn't work
do not throw out the approach
because the the public is so deeply
underserved in in the both sides
situation if you could do anything just
anything that would move you a little
bit toward showing two sides of a story
for the first time ever
it would be
a civilization changing I mean it would
be one of the biggest
you know it would be interesting is that
if musk became the agent of why this
happens right just because he's
influential he's in the conversation if
musk is the one who made this happen you
know some kind of a understanding of a
process to show both sides in a public
way
it would be his greatest contribution to
civilization
and you'd never think of it that way
you'd always think of going to Mars or
building electric cars but if he did
that one thing
just taught us a model
for getting a little closer to
understanding both sides if that's all
he did in his whole life
it would be the greatest contribution to
the civilization
it'd be hard to top
um
but Mark Cuban another billionaire has
gotten into this conversation and I'm
just going to read you uh Mark Cuban's
statements his actual words
because it's a little hard to paraphrase
so I want you to see his actual words
he said trying to bully Dr Hotes is
ridiculous uh Cuban continued quote you
have producers that will prepare you and
you get to control the conversation
meaning Rogan he would be prepared by
producers as would RFK Junior Kennedy
also has a staff ready to prepare him
and those topics are what he talks about
in every speech you both do this meaning
Joe Rogan and RFK you both do this on a
daily basis well Dr Hotes works every
day to try to make things find ways to
help people
um they slammed uh Rogan and Musk for
worsening the the climate you know on
social media and he says uh Joe
uh meaning Rogan Joe you and Elon musk's
Twitter are the mainstream online media
and your platforms have become
everything supposedly wrong with MSM you
are driven by self-interest just like
the MSM always has been accused of Cuban
wrote you both have earned that right
you busted your asses to be great at
what you do and earned all you've
accomplished but don't lie to yourself
and all of us and tell us you are
different you aren't whoa
well somebody woke up on the wrong side
of the bed
don't tell us you're different you're
the same
now do I agree with Mark Cuban or
disagree what do you think
do you think I'm going to agree with
Mark Cuban or disagree which way am I
gonna go
well I'll tell you in general I hate to
disagree with Mark Cuban it's just a bad
play
right disagreeing with people that's
smart isn't a bad it's not a good
strategy in life right so I like to find
ways to agree with smart people just
generally speaking
um I would say the following I agree
with Mark what Mark Cuban says
because I agree with follow the money
vaccine or genetic disposition to
vaccines you know it's an interesting
story but I don't want to get off off
track right now
um
except I did I got off track what was I
saying
see that's the problem with the the
super prompt you know where you pay
money to make a comment is so
destructive to the like the flow
I I I think I think YouTube should
remove that
I mean I love it when people give me
money
that's cool but I'd rather I didn't get
the money and I'd rather that it just
wasn't available as a as an option that
would be better so I'd encourage you not
to give me money for that
um
all right so I agree with Cuban that
both Joe Rogan and Elon Musk
um are at the very least part of a
process in which following the money is
going to be the predictive
DNA
all right I said that terribly let me
try it again
it is true that Joe Rogan is in a job
where he's trying to make money although
On Any Given topic he may not be
thinking of it that way in other words
on this topic he probably is actually
just thinking what would be good for the
country
but have I told you a million times
that people do have lofty goals that's a
real thing people often have lofty help
the world goals but what they actually
do
is coincidentally exactly what makes
them money
which doesn't make the lofty goals not
real
I think that they're real in the sense
that the person really believes it it's
the only thing they're thinking about
they're not thinking about the money but
coincidentally
people always seem to do what's good for
their money don't they
and Joe Rogan
you know this supporting the Mark Cuban
argument Joe Rogan is doing a job where
the moral audience he gets the better he
does the better Spotify does and so
having a debate would be good for views
so I like the criticism so far that
Rogan is a is a money-making entity and
that may not be fully compatible
with trying to tell people the truth
you agree right
that there's a little bit of conflict
doesn't have to be not necessarily like
it's not guaranteed but you could have a
little conflict between what makes you
money and what's exactly true
and musk of course owns Twitter
so musk would musk also likes big topics
with you know big uh let's say event
related stuff because it's it's a
marketing strategy now do you think that
musk is thinking of it primarily as a
marketing strategy for Twitter
I would say probably not
probably not all indications are he'd
actually like to see the debate he's
probably looking at it just like you and
I are which is wouldn't you like to see
that now I saw I saw a criticism from
somebody else online that it's all about
creating a spectacle and you know the
spectacle doesn't help us everybody just
wants the spectacle
to which I say we love the spectator
but if the spectacle is what draws you
to the information
very good I mean it's just what Trump
does right creates a spectacle and he
draws you to the information he'd like
you to act on
so I don't mind the spectacle part if
you do it right if the only thing you're
doing is a spectacle it's a waste of
time
but if you're a spectacle to get people
and you do it right well two good things
in a row so
so I would agree that there's a money
motive and that imagining that Joe Rogan
or Elon Musk or somehow outside the
influence of
you know the money motive that drives
everything we do
it's a good I would say sort of a
dickish thing to say but
philosophically
I'd agree
but what about
um what about the bullying part
is it bullying to offer somebody a huge
amount of money to the charity of their
choice
to come on television to talk about
their own area of expertise
on the most important question in
America probably you know trusting our
experts
does that seem like bullying
because it's not it's not as if he's
never been on TV
this is somebody who goes on TV looks
like every time he's asked by the major
networks
so
so I'm not buying I'm not buying the
he's incapable
there's there's nothing to suggest that
he wouldn't do a good job representing
his side
and I think it's sort of insulting it's
a little bit insulting to imagine that
he couldn't I mean he has a PHD in an MD
and he's an expert at this field
so and he's been on TV lots of times
doing a good job
I mean really is it believed to say that
that guy
that that guy should talk to somebody
who's got some questions that doesn't
feel like bullying at all like I don't
get it
does anybody else feel as bullied
to me that's exactly the right question
I don't see it at all
right now of course the uh the internet
is bullying again
so just to be clear I don't think musk
and uh musk is just having a good time
with it saying he said on Twitter I
guess he doesn't like charity
is that bully
I mean you're certainly persuading and
cajoling
but I don't I don't say this bullying at
all right so I disagree on that
characterization but you know again
Cuban is talking with some hyperbole
so calling it bullying is not really
something you fat check he's using some
hyperbole so we'll let him get away with
the hyperbole I guess I guess I'll I
will withdraw my objection to that
because you don't want to fact check
hyperbole
you know that right don't don't fact
check the hyperbole there's no point in
that
um
but then Mark Cuban said that Joe Rogan
and Kennedy both have uh staffs to
prepare them
does that feel like a good point
that Kennedy and Joe Rogan both have
like producers and staff to prepare them
that doesn't feel like a good point
because first of all do you think Joe
Rogan would have his producers prepare
him
for that I think they would just make
sure he knew when it was so he'd show up
on time and the cameras are rolling
I do not get the sense that Joe Rogan's
producers are doing a lot of producing
in terms of managing Joe Rogan
do you think that's happening
I mean he does have some one or more
producers I don't know I don't know what
the number is but I think they're just
there to make sure that the show happens
I don't think they're there telling what
they think or say
and
what about RFK Jr do you think RFK Jr
has anyone on this staff who knows more
than he does about the topic
I kind of doubt it
I doubt it
the whole point is that he he is the
topic he's like a walking Encyclopedia
of this topic it's been his life's work
so I don't think that the staff argument
holds and and it's so weak
that it makes me wonder what's behind it
I'll tell you what it makes it look like
it makes it look like Mark Cuban doesn't
want
um
the truth to come out
now obviously he's not thinking that in
a conscious way right because I would
trust Mark Cuban enough that consciously
is about thinking that I guarantee you
he's not consciously afraid that it will
go not his way
but the way he's acting
suggests there might be a subconscious
concern that he might be wrong
and it would be very very bad for
anybody to be on the wrong end of this
conversation believe me when the the
when the rumors started that I was on
the wrong end of everything when 4chan
did their little prank on me
it really makes life difficult
when everybody thinks you're part of
wrecking the world
so I can see why uh there's some
prominent people who were
pro-vaccination again that's not exactly
a good characterization but uh you know
what I mean uh
I think it's a dangerous conversation I
think there are a lot of people who are
worried that these Skeptics have a
better argument
than uh has been presented to the public
so far the wider public
those on the right have seen so much
skeptical content that you wouldn't be
surprised
if RFK Jr won won the debate if you
could say when you wouldn't be surprised
but there are people on the left who
would be hearing things for the very
first time and they would be saying
wait what
so RFK JR could move the needle he's
persuasive enough and he would come well
armed enough that there would be people
hearing stuff that they'd never heard
before and it would be kind of a shock
to their systems
all right
um so our Rogan and musk contributing to
the worsening climate
I don't see that
I do not see Rogan and musk contributing
to a worsening climate I say exactly the
opposite I mean musk is saying
if you're running for president
doesn't matter what side you're on I
want you on Spaces
how is that wrong
you're inviting everybody and giving
them a big platform
trying to get rid of the Shadow Banning
I mean to me it looks like everything he
does is in a positive direction in a bad
way
positive direction
all right
one of the claims about I mean there's a
little side street I'm going to take
what are the claims about vaccinations
by some critics is that they might be
behind the increase in autism
have you've heard that argument right
there's some who believe that some
childhood shots are behind autism
now
you've heard the other explanation for
the rise in autism right
I wouldn't rule that now by the way but
there's another explanation have you not
heard it
is not environment it's no it's not an
environment or pollution
every is enough food
uh old dads is one right the age the age
of the parents is one there's another
one that's related to that
not medications not chemicals not
telomeres not old sperm well the old
sperm we just talked about
wow I feel like
no there's another reason
how do you not all know this
so I guess so I'm going to give you
something to fact check okay
uh Elon Musk says he has two kids on the
Spectrum and of seven seven children two
out of seven
Elon Musk says it's inheritable
so that he's the reason to have his gets
at it
do you think he's right that it's
inheritable
do you believe it is inheritable two of
his kids
I would say yes
yeah I I feel we don't you know I'm not
a scientist but I feel that's probably
true all right now what would happen if
two Elon musks got married
so there's a female Elon Musk let's say
unrelated but basically safe
um
and he marries another Elon Musk do the
odds of having a autistic kid go up
if there are two contributors instead of
one
logically yes right again
I don't have a study that proves it but
logically you'd expect it now number two
in our modern world
can the Elon Musk male and female find
each other more easily
do it do we have a civilization in which
if you're a smart Elon Musk type you
could easily find your your matching
female Elon Musk yes it's called going
to work
because if you go to work at Microsoft
you walk down the hallway and there's
all these other Elon musks
you find a female one you marry him and
now you've got two Elon musks do they
have more autistic kids and kids on the
Spectrum I believe the answer is yes
now this is what I need to fact check on
I thought that was well established
is it not
so am I wrong that that's not so well
established it's just
true
but I was surprised that most of you
were not aware of that at least claim
again I'm not going to say it's true but
I'll say that the claim has been out
there for
20 years
20 years I think
and I don't see anything wrong with it
to me that seems so obvious so obviously
true that it would take quite a bit of
science to talk me out of it I could be
talked out of it if they found some way
to test it and it was reliable
but it seems to me that you don't need
any vaccinations to explain it the rise
of technology companies brought male and
female Elon musk's together they married
and had kids and that's the end of the
story
and then there's also the other part
that people are having children older
so if they're a little bit older
they're more likely I guess
um I saw a paid comment go by
that uh
Mark Cuban is also a investor in or
owner of I don't know which it is of
this male what would you call it drugs
by mail company I forget what it's
called so he's got cheap drugs
generics I guess that you can get
through him that's competing with the
rest of the industry so so you should
understand that he's in the business of
selling
pharmacy from us
pharmaceutical products
and that might have it that might have
an impact on his public opinion on this
stuff
it's not directly related
but you should assume that he you know
he's in that world that's part of the
story
I always like it when uh
I see my uh my billionaire is arguing
it's always productive to me
to see that all right Jordan Peterson is
warning uh Lex Friedman that he could
get kicked off of YouTube
for doing certain kinds of things such
as
talking to Skeptics and this these are
the things that Jordan Peterson and I
guess the daily wire Plus have gotten in
trouble for recently
they've removed Jordan Peterson's
interview with RFK Jr
they they took it off of YouTube
as a citizen of the United States
it has been judged that you cannot see
Jordan Peterson talking to a major
presidential candidate
I I think I think my mind is going to
explode
how is that possible
like what could RFK Jr have said
that isn't the Public's not just right
to know
but we should have a pretty big interest
in knowing what did he say that's so
horrible that he had to remove it
was a vaccination skepticism
that's it and and who decided he was
wrong
who at YouTube
was the person who could look at rfk's
argument and Junior's argument and know
it's wrong which which major scientist
did that
I mean everything about this seems just
so
so wrong
now I'm not saying that everything RFK
Jr said is accurate I'm not qualified to
judge but I'm pretty sure YouTube
doesn't know
and I'm pretty sure he's a major
candidate for president who has an
actual path to the office unlike you
know some who don't have a path
yeah
so anyway uh also got kicked off
when Jordan Peterson interviewed Matt
Walsh
and Helen Joyce I don't know who Helen
Joyce was was she in the trans which
field is she in Helen Joyce I didn't see
that interview
well whatever it was it was too
controversial for
for a YouTube and the weird thing about
this is
it it's like they don't have any idea
who Jordan Peterson is
somehow
because correct me if I'm wrong
but if Jordan Peterson saw some
unscientific
he'd be the one to call it out
am I wrong
like who would be more qualified
to stop somebody from saying some just
total
that him
I I can't imagine who who I would be
happier with you know monitoring what
information is considered credible for
me
I mean I would trust him completely
which doesn't mean he's right and it
doesn't mean he's right but he's
qualified to understand what looks like
 in the scientific realm and if
he calls it out I'd say oh okay there's
somebody who knows some when he
sees it he just called it out but if he
doesn't call it out
I would like to know that too
if somebody as smart as Jordan Peterson
listens to an argument that's counter to
the mainstream argument and he says you
know
that's good enough to be on my podcast I
don't know if it's right
but it's a good enough point to be on my
podcast
I'd like to know that
so YouTube
I get that you're trying to you know
keep the world safe
I get that
and if he had if they had demonetized
these things I understand that as well
because the advertisers do have a
preference of not being associated with
certain kinds of content
that's his business
so if they demonetize that that's a
whole different argument
but removing it
removing it
and that seems so far over the line
of what of what society would expect of
you
YouTube now maybe there's a you know I'm
only hearing one side of the argument
maybe there's something I don't know
about in this but I doubt it
all right uh
CNN got fact checked on Twitter which I
love the community notes thing
um CNN tweeted uh black fathers are
often portrayed as absent or distance or
distant but that isn't what most people
experience according to both data and
black dads themselves
uh blah blah bias portrayals and then
Community notes fact check them with the
following facts there's 64 percent of
black kids have single parents single
parent homes
42 percent of Hispanic
24 of white
and 16 percent of Asian have a single
pair of home
does the order of those things remind
you of the order of any other thing
what what else is that that has this
exact order
blackheads Hispanic kids white kids
uh Asians well it has exactly that order
crime and academics
crime and academics and success right
they're all perfectly correlated
now uh since this is a conservative
audience
can we conclude that the having the
single parent some of this might be a
single male parent but can we conclude
that the single parent is causing all
these problems
that a single-parent environment is
is causing crime low academics maybe
affecting IQ all that stuff
somebody's clarifying that these single
mothers have been identified as more of
the more correlated I think that's true
by the way I did see a study that said
the single fathers were doing a better
job I I don't know but I saw a study
so so most of you would say this is
pretty strong evidence
given that the rate of single Parenthood
in these groups seems to almost
identically match their performance and
output in a variety of ways
so it's the Cause right
do you is that your does your logic says
that this is the cause
no they're definitely correlated
they correlated but is it a causation
I don't see it
I don't see it I think there's a cause
that causes the single Parenthood
that causes everything else
isn't it more likely that whatever is
causing this is causing everything that
that they all have the same cause it's
not that the one thing caused the others
right
so I've never quite agreed with the
single parent
Simplicity uh right-leading opinion so
the right just says look the correlation
is really clear
single parent house you're going to do
poorly period so stop having those
single parent houses if you just stop
having the the fatherlessness you'll do
five because the the facts just show
that high correlation
I don't buy it
I don't buy it I think that whatever
causes uh
the single parent's situation
is probably causing all the other
problems
it's just one thing whatever it is it's
just causing everything now it may not
be one thing it might be like a basket
of things you know not just one item but
whatever it is is probably causing
everything
all right
let me ask you something is this the
first time anybody ever said in front of
you
that the single pair of thing might be
just another thing that's caused by some
other thing
is it the first time you've heard that
because that would be very sad
now and and let me let me be clear I'm
not ruling out
that the single pair of thing is
actually the cause of the other things
I'm not ruling it out I'm saying it's
just not demonstrated
it's just correlation it's just not
causation it might be
it might be
let me give you a
um a different way to look at it
now this is this is not I'm not saying
this is true this is not a claim of
Truth this is just so you could think of
like a mental experiment
suppose the way mothers Act is
completely different among the the three
entities
if you married an Asian woman
do you think she would treat her man
better
than if you married a Black Or Hispanic
woman
now again
in each of these cases I'm not making a
claim there's something different about
the people so I'm not making that claim
I'm just walking you through a mental
experiment where you could imagine
that there's something
causing all of it to happen
so
anecdotally
most men would say the Asian woman
treats the man better
so is a man more likely to stay married
if he's treated well
what do you think
[Laughter]
yes
so the problem is not the single stuff
maybe the problem is whatever caused you
to be single in the first place
Maybe
maybe the mom is defective
Maybe
so and when I say defective I don't mean
DNA
I'm not saying that
I'm saying that maybe there's a
difference in how people act
for whatever reason you know you you
could have your own reason for why they
act that way but they do act different
right do you think Asian-American kids
stop by the police acts exactly the same
as the black 19 year old stop by the
police
does anybody believe that
does anybody believe that no
no you're not allowed to say it I mean I
can say it because I got a disgraced and
canceled so I could just say it out loud
there's nobody in the world who believes
that a 19 year old black kid on average
right individuals yes
anything you say about a group doesn't
apply to the individuals but as a group
there's nobody in the world nobody black
nobody Asian who thinks the average
Asian kid acts just the same in a police
stop
as the average black kid nobody believes
that now I don't know why
I actually don't know why if I did I'd
give you some speculation I don't know
why
but it's just obvious
so why would they get the same outcome
if you act differently how can you
possibly get the same outcome as
somebody said the other day
why do we talk about culture
you know this is my culture and I want
to protect my culture if you don't act
different
isn't the whole point of a culture is
that you act different
so if you're acting different and
getting different outcomes
it's supposed to work that way that's
exactly how it's supposed to work you
act different you get different outcomes
so I don't to me none of this is too
surprising
culture would explain it I don't know if
that is the explanation but it would
explain it I mean it fits the facts
but then you have to go back to another
level
what causes the culture
what causes the culture
I would say density
as much as anything
if you looked at the culture of
low-income black people living in high
density areas
does it look just like
the low-income black people who are
living in less dense areas in the
countryside for example
probably not I mean they might like to
say music
yeah that's about it
so I think density might be uh the
underlooked the under appreciated
variable nobody ever talks about that
density population density
mushrooms are all the Zeitgeist now
everybody seems to be talking about it
at the same time
so Australia is the first nation to
approve psychedelics as treatment
for conditions such as PTSD so various
mental conditions
but apparently according to the story
a patient will still have to jump
through hoops to get it
which is not a
you know you would expect that right
you'd have to do a lot of process to be
eligible to get it but that's beginning
now
at the same time that Australia is
legalizing it in limited way uh there's
a story on CNN where the CNN
correspondent went to I think it was
Jamaica where it's legal and uh did a
story in which he was observed doing
mushrooms
can you imagine
any world in which CNN would have their
their own host go to another country so
that it's legal and take a Dr take an
illegal drug illegal in this country uh
and then just do a story about like how
a felt and what he learned and stuff
doesn't that seem amazing to you
and it was a it was a positive story so
the the bottom line was you know nothing
bad about mushrooms
but the fact that CNN is you know really
the representative of the mainstream in
many ways they're basically saying
mushrooms yes
did you see that coming
that's the most unusual outcome
that the mainstream
is seeing mushrooms as it's it's time to
go time time to legalize them
it's quite it's quite quite a surprise
because I think a lot of people on the
right have been there for a long time
yeah just in terms of Freedom yeah why
don't why don't I have the freedom to
put my body what I want
not all the people on the right but you
know the the freedom loving ones
I saw an argument on uh also CNN
uh that Trump's declassification
argument is bunk
and the idea is that Trump is claiming
that he can declassify anything just by
removing it
I agree with that
so I agree with Trump's stake that if
there's no if there's no written uh law
and it's up to the president then he can
do what he wants
but apparently during the Obama
Administration
uh there was an executive order
that was created that did give some
guidelines about how to handle
classified stuff and apparently Trump
did not follow those guidelines but
here's my question not being a lawyer
does a president have to follow an
executive order
how does that work
it's an executive order it's like the
president's order now if it comes from a
prior president like I get it that that
stays in place until it gets changed
but if you're talking about the
president
does the president have to do what
another president ordered which the new
president could could reverse just by
writing a piece of paper
because if Trump didn't follow those
executive orders
it's just a paperwork problem because he
could have simply written on a piece of
paper I rescind this executive order
right he had the full power to rescind
it I think it's an executive order
yeah they're not laws and so if so if
Trump ignored it
would that be breaking a law or is that
ignoring an executive order that he
could have made go away with a stroke of
a pep
it looks like you just cut a corner it
doesn't look like the worst problem in
the world
yeah all right well I just wanted you to
hear that argument unless it comes up
because you're never going to hear it in
the right-leaning press but it doesn't
look convincing to me
so here's my bottom line
you can't put my president
whether it's Biden or Trump or anybody
else you can't put my president in jail
when lawyers can't agree what the law is
you can't
will not happen
will not happen
and
furthermore
if the public isn't allowed to see these
documents
I get
I get why we're not allowed to see them
but you can't put them in jail
if we can't see them now I would be
willing to allow that if Republicans
have access to it people who had
security clearance and it was a set of
Republicans you could trust
you know if you let your you know uh let
your Thomas Masseys in there or your Tom
Cottons or people basically you would
trust if they said yeah this is bad you
know I hate to say it but
you know we've looked at these documents
and it's way worse than we thought they
would be God admit they're bad I believe
that the Republicans would do that I
would trust them not everyone
not everyone
but there is a handful of Republicans
that could have the right clearance that
I would say all right I don't need to
know but you know and I'm going to take
your word for it I would go with that
but I'm definitely not going to listen
to Democrats who say it's bad and they
can't show it to me
right so you can't put my president in
jail over documents that at least people
I believe haven't seen
and lawyers can't even decide if a law
is broken
uh Andrew you're very dumb but I'd like
to mock you for a minute
Andrew says Scott Adams says never voted
sucks
all right first of all that's not true I
have voted yet last week he said we all
need to vote LOL
did I say you all need to vote
I don't remember saying that I think you
got two or three hallucinations going
there at once
but yeah I voted the reason I don't vote
is that I have voted
did I tell you I voted for
when I voted for president
Jimmy Carter Jimmy Carter
and do you know what I learned after I
voted for Jimmy Carter
what did I learn
tell me tell me what did I learn when I
voted for Jimmy Carter
that I don't know enough to vote
yeah I learned that I'm bad at voting
didn't help did I make anything better
by my vote
no I made the world worse if anything
and Dapper Dale believes the 4chan hoax
about my pandemic opinions
Dapper Dale
you're you're very gullible
he just wants to say the same thing over
and over again
we'll hide you
you are now hidden Dapper goodbye
good he's gone
board dapper
um
all right that ladies and gentlemen is
all I wanted to tell you today
and uh
thanks for joining
and just remember
debates are good
and if science won't go to your debate
science gets to lose
science loses I think the last
credibility of science was removed today
now if the if the debate or something
like it happens then I'll change my mind
but Dr Hotes destroyed science
completely today
I feel like one person destroyed science
because when I see that he's unwilling
to debate
I I get his you know like I said I
understand the subjections to it
but they're not good enough
they're not good enough if science can't
defend itself then we can ignore it
if it's so weak that it can't defend
itself
you can ignore it
which would be terrible of course
so all right
uh is there a video or transcript of my
meltdown at the Starbucks
probably they probably have internal
security
but it was it wasn't as spectacular I
didn't raise my voice
when I say it was a meltdown
uh I wasn't shouting
I was just getting in his face with with
some
some truth
all right
that's all we got now and I will talk to
you tomorrow YouTube
