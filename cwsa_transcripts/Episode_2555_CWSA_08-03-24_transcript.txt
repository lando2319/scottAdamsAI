well what is show you're going to have
today it's going to be
incredible best Saturday experience of
your life probably you'll be talking
about it for
years that's how good it will
[Music]
be good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott ad Saturday edition
while everybody else is lazy and
sleeping if you'd like to take this
experience which is already going to be
amazing up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need is a cuper mug
or glass a tankered CH ofin a canteen
jug of flask vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the do mean the day thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
oh so
good so
good well here's an important story uh
for people like me did you know that
young people are or young women are
estwing high heels for
clubbing so I I'm not I have to say that
it's been a while since I've been to a
club let's say when was the last time I
went clubbing it was uh uh last time I
went clubbing was oh never never so I've
never been clubbing but I understand
that it was common for women to wear
heels and apparently now women going out
for the evening wear some kind of
sneakers and jeans and I thought to
myself
finally finally we finally found
something that could help human
reproduction
have you noticed that every Trend in the
news is negative it's like the the
dating apps are destroying us and the
only fans is bad and the porn is
terrible and the AI is going to take all
of our romantic interest away and
everything seems to be going the wrong
direction but if women take their heels
off suddenly they have access to a whole
new range of men I.E men who were not
tall enough if they wore heels but if
they don't wear heels tall
enough so it's like men just gained 3
Ines in height everywhere in the United
States young ones because the young
women are not wearing
heels and the big difference is whether
they're taller than the woman and that
that seems more important than you know
how tall they are in general they like
them tall women do but they certainly
have to be taller than the woman that
seems to be you know key criteria on the
dating apps so get rid of those heels
ladies your mating opportunities have
just going up
substantially well you were probably
aware of the stock markets and the
dumper but here's how you should look at
this let me tell you one thing that I
told uh a young investor months ago I
said stock market is looking really good
right yeah looking really good
you know in the summer it always takes a
 what yeah in the summer the stock
market always takes a
dump now I think there may have been an
exception like some weird years but
generally speaking people like to sell
what they have in the summer and go on
vacation literally they don't want to
look at their their Holdings so anything
that's sketchy they just sell it before
they go on vacation so you always get a
fall in the summer it might mean
something something and it might not it
could be because of the unemployment it
could be because the FED hasn't raised
the interest rates it could be something
about the election it could be something
about AI got a little
overrun so there was no qu let me put it
this
way there was no future there was no
possibility that the market wouldn't go
down at least
10% everybody who's experienced as an
investor knows that
right we were heading for a 10%
correction minimum I mean it could be
more but minimum 10% so you're just
seeing the expected 10% correction
doesn't mean it'll stay there I would
expect that there's nowhere else to put
your money you know you don't want your
money in cash you can't put it all in
Bitcoin because you're not quite sure
that's the way to go so what are you
going to do put it in your mattress then
it just gets inflated away if you want
to keep up with inflation you're either
going to have to own property which has
its own risks or the broad stock market
so for me the anti-inflation play is
primarily just being in index funds you
know if if the big companies can't raise
their prices then nobody can so that's
my play I'm keeping all of my stocks
selling
nothing and I wouldn't be
surprised if you see it changing quite a
bit between now and the election you'll
because I also think the players game
the
system so it could be that people are
just taking some profits from AI
companies that ran up too much but it
could be that you'll see a bunch of
super rich Democrats say you know it
would be really good for the Democrats
is if the market felt like it was
recovering so I think you're going to
see a bunch of fake very large
industrial buyers before election day so
here's my
prediction whatever the stock market
Market is
today I think it will be higher than
that on Election Day and it won't be
normal like it'll just be gaming the
system kind of stuff that's what I think
so that doesn't mean in the long run
anything it just means I expect a little
bit of
Mischief all right uh so according to
breit Bar news the Democrats are
panicked now and they want a rate cut
because unemployment took a little jump
so If the Fed cuts the rates that
normally juices the stock market and the
rest of the economy but the FED
is independent is so they don't have to
do something just because the Democrats
want it now you might say to yourself on
this next story Scott why are you always
talking about batteries batteries are so
boring oh but are they I think
understanding batteries and the new
technology coming is just one of the
biggest things to understand so here's a
big big big story about batteries soyer
Merit on X is reporting this so Tesla
apparently has been working on something
called a CA a dry cathode battery
meaning that there would be no moist
parts of the battery this has been a
long dream apparently that was just too
hard to do people have tried it but
haven't gotten far enough but um it
would red if it works Tesla would reduce
their own cost cost between 15 and 30%
if they can scale
it that's right the cost of a Tesla
could come down 20 to 30% if they put
these better batteries in but that's not
all takes up a lot less
space um and U they can make smaller
more efficient factories to make these
uh fewer steps higher density more range
better for the
environment and of course we're going to
need some really good batteries for your
robots you think if you think your
battery keeps running down in your car
wa till you see your robot at least the
robot can go plug itself back in
actually your robot could probably drive
your Tesla to the charging station and
charge it for you so that's
coming uh meanwhile California is uh
floating the idea internally about
purchasing and owning its own refineries
now you might say to yourself what uh
isn't California part of the United
States and don't we live in a free
market capitalist system where the very
dumbest thing you could ever do is have
the state own your means of production
because that's like communism it's like
Venezuela and every single possible
element of that is bad
idea that's why we're doing
it if you if anybody has a like an
updated list of terrible ideas could you
send it to us in California because
we're running out of terrible ideas
we've implemented them
all and this new one I think gets sort
of the end of our list you know once you
start getting rid of capitalism entirely
let the criminals out uh let the the uh
people from other countries flow in let
that fenel come in come on fenel let's
get that in here and then the only other
thing we can do oh besides the fact that
you can't get a house insurance if you
live in California because of the poor
management of the forest
ours but uh now we're going to have uh
barely uh get rid of capitalism because
you know the state is really good at
running businesses for
your yeah okay yep California has become
like Venezuela except except without the
excellent leadership of
Maduro well Elon Musk had apparently an
eight and a half hour interview with Lex
fredman I don't understand
that I don't know why they did
that but okay so I guess they they get
along pretty well because they had a
long
talk um so here's some things we know
now
neurolink is looking to you know
massively increase the number of
electrodes into the brain and they're
working on a uh product in the future
that would allow maybe blind people to
see for the first time think how amazing
that would
be imagine if Elon Musk bypassed
eyes and just put a little camera on
your head that is stuck into your brain
and then blind people could just
see and what about deaf
people probably probably deaf people
will be able to hear he also see seems
to have some potential for solving
schizophrenia seizures and memory issues
well we're going to be full Android
pretty soon you know Elon points out as
I've pointed out for years that we're
already
Androids the fact that you can put your
phone down doesn't change that your your
phone is basically connected to your
body and your brain you know that every
once in a while you forget it but that's
more of a design
flaw anyway in other news the uh NFL
announced that all of the teams will be
implementing facial
recognition so that every person who
attends a a professional football game
will be identified by facial recognition
software to verify their
identity um does anybody wonder
why is there something we don't know
about that makes that
necessary what what exactly is the
purpose of doing that
is that for the benefit of the safety of
the people going to the
stadium is that for the government to
find out where all the Trump supporters
are what is that I crowd control collect
data you know remember something I've
been telling you for years that you AED
is that there's no hope of preserving
privacy
there is no hope of PR preserving
privacy so you should get your head
straight about living a life that could
survive no
privacy if you haven't already made that
change you really need to stop saying
anything in a digital means that you're
not willing to defend in public I think
I stopped saying things
digitally maybe 20 years
ago probably 20 years ago was the last
time I said something that maybe I'd be
embarrassed if somebody saw it now I
only say things that if it came out I'd
say yeah you that is my
opinion I don't think there's anything I
write down digitally that I couldn't say
in public and it's been that way for a
long time and you know I've I've had
actually had the experience of sending
an encrypted message and then seeing it
in the
news that'll that'll straighten you out
really fast yeah imagine sending an
encrypted app message and then seeing it
in the news yep that happened that's a
real thing that happened with
me anyway um remember that story about
the 911 planners who were in custody and
they did a plea deal and the plea deal
would give them life in prison but no
execution well defense secretary Lloyd
Austin has reversed that and actually
removed removed from office the person
who approved it so not only did he
reverse it but the person who tried to
do it in the first place got slapped
down pretty hard they were removed from
that position that's a pretty hard
rebuke now does it seem to you like this
is maybe entirely
political it looks entirely political to
me I think the uh the Democrats just
thought it was awkward to do this right
before an election because it's just one
more thing you can you know pin on
Biden I think this is purely
political what would be the other reason
and by the way I don't have any problem
with the plea
deal is there something wrong with
it how many of you think that the um
terrorists would be
happier if they're if they have life in
prison I don't see that I see them being
being happier to to be
executed if you had life in
prison wouldn't you want to be
executed especially if you thought you'd
get your 72
virgins I'm not even like I don't
understand it like are we trying to be
good to the Bad
Guys by giving them life well how's that
even a
deal so so there's something deeply
unreported about this there's something
about the story we're
missing and whatever that is is going to
be interesting but we'll probably never
find
out anyway don't believe the news uh
speaking of the news Russia allegedly
here's another one I don't believe all
right so I saw this on social media so
I'll tell you what it says but I don't
believe it uh that Russia is going to
block Google IOS and
Android what would he use if it doesn't
use those now blocking Google seems
possible but how do you block IOS and
Android what is there some operating
system is it a Chinese operating system
will they just go China
products
maybe but uh why would they do this it's
probably for security right is it for
security or is it just to damage the
US's dominance in the
industry don't know but uh I would think
that if Putin doesn't trust Google IOS
and Android maybe you shouldn't
either and again just assume you have no
privacy uh Russia probably isn't happy
with giving up their privacy but we
already have so it's no real
difference all right we're all waiting
breathlessly for any moment now Iran to
respond and attack Israel maybe through
proxies because Israel murdered their
the head of uh hamas's political wing
while he was in Iran in the guest house
and Iran is saying that Israel crossed
all their red lines their response will
be Swift and
heavy and and then the US is sending
military
forces there so we'll have a strike
group and we'll have some more aircraft
and whatever assets we need just in case
now of course it's being it's being
presented as this is a way to reduce
violence because it'll maybe make Iran
think they don't want to do too
much but to me it's always so weird
when two countries at War do War
Theater now when Israel takes out the
leader one of the leaders of Hamas
that's not a theater that's
militarily
strategic but when Iran um responds
isn't that purely
theater because Iran's response nobody
expects it will change anybody's future
Behavior they just have to act like they
look like they can do stuff so whatever
they do is just going to be some weird
theery thing and if they go too
far they will invite more destruction on
themselves than they want so they've got
this weird little situation where they
have to do something theatrical that
maybe kills an Israeli if you know if
they get what they want um but they
can't do anything that's
important so what's what's that leave
you can't do anything
important but it can't actually make a
difference because if it makes a
difference that would be too dangerous
for
Iran
so it might be like that last thing
where they warned the US well there
might be an attack you might want to
duck and get in holes and uh you know we
don't want to kill anybody but we got to
make a theatrical attack so you know
everybody here it comes and so it looks
like they're not going to give a warning
this time or at least that's what we're
told maybe they
will but here's my
prediction I think Israel is going to
degrade Hezbollah and they're just
looking for any excuse
now they don't need an excuse because
Hezbollah has been you know continuously
attacking forever what they need is for
the Israeli public and the American
public to say oh there's a good
excuse so I don't think Iran has ever
been in a more perilous
situation because if they do something
theatrical that everybody can agree was
a nothing maybe things just chug along
the way they have been but they say
Israel crossed a red
line which means an appropriate response
would also cross a red
line now can they find a red line that
they think is a red line that they
crossed while Israel can argue well that
wasn't much of a red line and the US can
say well I see they tried but we shot
down all their missiles so it was sort
of a
nothing this one's going to be really
interesting I think the hardest part
will be Iran trying to figure out
something that's the right message and
that they could actually execute I don't
know what there is um I'll tell you what
they won't
do I don't expect them to kill a high
ranking high ranking American or
military officer I don't think they're
going to take a head shot at Israel
because again that would be full
War so I think it's inevitable that
Israel will uh have
to attack Hezbollah directly and
massively I don't see any way around it
it's just when it happens
really um could it could it happened
this month or next year it's just going
to happen I I would rule out any
possibility it doesn't happen I don't
think that's even in the option set
anymore that's my
guess well Iran is apparently allegedly
who knows if this is true arrested more
than two dozen people that they think
might have been knowledgeable are
possibly complicit in this assassination
in their country and I say to myself if
they arrested two dozen people doesn't
that mean they're going to torture them
all right mean if they arrested them but
they don't have evidence that they were
involved it it sounds like they're just
grabbing everybody who would know
anything and then they're just going to
torture them
all can Iran really get away with
torturing two dozen of their own people
of which I would guess no more than one
of them might have been
involved I it feels like that's kind of
a big risk for the the leader because if
you're in the military and you just
found out that two dozen people got
scooped up for
interrogation and you know for sure that
there couldn't be more than one of those
people who knew anything about
this You' feel pretty mad at your
leadership for treating you like you
Expendable I don't know if I could ever
get over that if I saw my beloved
leaders in the military you know people
I respected get scooped up when I knew
for sure they were not involved in this
because they just wouldn't be I don't
know that I could ever fight for that
country
again if they ever wanted to so Iran has
more problems than I've seen anybody
ever have a problem I don't know I don't
know how they're going to navigate this
well let's see um let's talk about
politics is anybody amazed that the top
two Democrats that the entire Democratic
party could put together the top two now
I'm not talking about the VP yet I'm
talking about uh Biden and then Harris
the top two what is the one thing they
both have in common this unusual for a
national
politician nobody thinks they can answer
a
question just hold that in your
mind the the two best thing people that
the Democrats could field Biden and
Harris nobody on either side not a
Democrat not a republican believes
they're capable of standing in front of
other people and answering basic
questions about their profession and
what's going
on how did we get here
yeah this is a great lesson on you can
get used to anything as long as it
happens a little bit slowly we just got
used to it how in the world how in the
world do the Democrats put up with
having their two best people unable to
talk in
public literally the most salian part of
the
job and we're just like we're just going
on so today after I'll say this I'll say
the two best Democrats one of them
likely to be the next president and they
can't talk in
public you could almost throw a dart
into a crowd and guess somebody who
could answer a question in public I mean
you have a good good shot at
it anyway so uh that's amazing but uh
there was apparently some kind of
accidental leak out of the Philadelphia
mayor's office some staffer that uh
released a video that would suggest that
the Democrats already know that they're
going to be choosing Josh Shapiro the
governor of
Pennsylvania for their VP candidate so I
think we're got all acting like that's a
done deal today even though it's not
official but we're going to talk about
it like it is and let's talk about the
fake news first how many of you believe
that Josh
Shapiro once served in the IDF
volunteered and then served in the IDF
that would be the Israeli Defense Force
the military in Israel how many believe
that's true because social media said it
was
true how many of you believe that's
actually a real
thing it's not a real
thing all right let me say it so so that
you don't embarrass yourself because a
lot of people in the right are falling
for this pretty
hard here's what was true in high school
his high school had some kind of a
program where they had to volunteer for
something so he and some other students
volunteered remember this is high school
these these are just kids uh volunteered
to uh or was it College uh volunteered
to go to uh Israel and they worked on a
Kuts or something but part of it is they
volunteered to do some inter like work
for the IDF they weren't in the
IDF they were like unpaid interns
sweeping sidewalks and you know doing
stuff like that so he wasn't carrying a
gun he wasn't going to war for the IDF
he wasn't a member of the IDF he was a
student who was having an experience in
another country that included some you
know some stuff that was unimportant and
student likee for a military force now
should you be comfortable with that just
because I said well he didn't you know
he didn't actually pledge his allegiance
to another country it's just it was just
a student
experience are you uncomfortable with
that to know there somebody who had a
substantial in his in his youth he had a
substantial experience with another
country that's an ally of the United
States how many of you have a problem
with
that because I think voters will that
they will hear the story and they'll
believe he had joined the military you
know probably probably a third of
conservatives will now forever believe
he fought in the Israeli
military probably a third and will never
be talked out of it because that's how
the fake news works it's pretty
sticky
um now what's interesting of course is
that Shapiro is Jewish and therefore the
question will be which party is more
anti-semitic so will there be more uh
Republicans who are on the extreme side
saying oh no that's one more reason we
can't vote for them well that shouldn't
make any difference because nobody I
don't think any Republicans would vote
for KL Harris because you picked a
Jewish vice president so that's probably
zero impact on the Republican side and I
don't think the Republicans would
necessarily well I just don't think the
Republicans will vote differently
because this in any way but we all are
asking the question hey aren't there a
lot of uh progressives over in the
Democrat Party who are not so pro-israel
at the moment maybe a little bit more
Pro Palestinian maybe Michigan maybe the
squad and the answer is yeah that's
probably going to be an issue
um but it depends how he talks about the
situation too you know I think what he
says today will be more important than
whatever he said in the past um and and
let me say this I think it's important
to know what the candidates thought in
the past you know it's important I think
to know that Trump was once a
Democrat I think that's important I
think it's important to know if uh KL
Harris used to have far more left
leaning opinions but maybe she's been
talked into something more Centrist to
get elected I I think we need to know
about the past but I I firmly believe
that if you can defend why you changed
your mind we should allow that I like
people who can change their
minds right that's not a negative it
used to be I remember Democrat or the
uh who was it I think mostly the
Republicans would complain about the
other candidate
flip-flopping you remember that used to
be the thing you're a
flip-flopper and I used to say you mean
somebody updated their thinking with new
information why are we mad at
that I want the person who can update
their thinking with new information and
we've seen it happen I want to know I've
seen it I don't want somebody to go into
office and say I have the same opinions
I had when I was 20 that would scare the
 out of me I need somebody who is
mentally flexible and capable of
changing their opinion so I think it's
important to know that kamla
had some instincts that were left
leaning and she might bring that into
the office but uh if she could defend
her new
opinions then I would feel differently
about it for example if somebody said
well I used to think um Universal
healthc care like one Single Payer was
the only way to go but now I think it
would be impractical because the country
really wants Private health insurance
too and uh there's no way you could get
there anyway so now I think I'll just
you know want to lower prices for
healthcare so you could you could
imagine her explaining it in a way where
you'd say oh well if you can make the
argument that suggests that you
understand the argument for that new
opinion so look look for ability to
defend the current opinion that would be
far more
important all right
so we we're going to be talking almost
Non-Stop about anti-Semitism just
because she Peru is in the race we'll
see how that goes but again most people
don't vote for anybody who's the vice
president anyway so he's in favor of a
two country solution in Israel he thinks
Netanyahu is the worst leader
ever
um well there you
go now I think uh there's going to be a
lot of talk about his what the critics
will say some kind of split loyalty
which I don't see in
evidence but that'll be part of the
story people will suspect he's got split
Allegiance and again there's no evidence
of that um it's not illegal to visit
another country and have an
experience all
right so let's talk about how clean the
elections will be coming
up so as you're all aware in 2020 there
were great number of people who
questioned the election whether it was
fair but we've had four years since then
so thank God all the problems have been
fixed
what what nothing's
different well let's do a little rundown
of what we know about the coming
election number one attorney generals
from Virginia and Missouri and
Wyoming are going to look into act blue
that's a big fundraiser raing entity for
the
Democrats that uh according to OMG and
O'Keefe James O'Keefe and his
investigation according to them they've
been laundering large donations from God
knows
where maybe a foreign country we don't
even know um through the the names of
elderly who don't know their names are
being used because you can't give big
dollar amounts you know there's limits
but you can say oh a million people
donated a little bit each but they're
fake fake uh donors they're real people
they're just elderly people who are
never going to check and nobody will
ever know that they didn't really
donate so the evidence seems pretty
strong there something sketchy is going
there so one of the biggest sources of
money for the Democrats might be
fake but hey that's just you know one
element of an election is the funding so
just because the funding might be
fake that doesn't mean anything else is
fake people I don't want you to get all
crazy about doubting things just because
the funding for the Democrats is
probably
fraudulent and we do expect that some of
the largest donors are also blackmailed
so I wouldn't believe anything about the
funding
sources uh but hey that's just one part
of an election I mean it does affect it
so it does seem that crime would be
already affecting the outcome but
remember there are lots more elements to
an election so it's not all about the
funding uh there's also the
media see MSNBC says uh it's a life or
death Choice um if you pick Trump so
somebody named uh Tara setm said in
MSNBC and I quote Women Voters are
looking at this election as a life or
death Choice the binary choice is
democracy or Trump and for women it's
our lives or
Trump okay so all right so the media is
totally
fixed and they're just going to give you
scary stories about Trump that are all
just made up but people I want you to
relax a little bit because I know you're
thinking oh wait so the funding is
totally
illegitimate and the media which is the
only source of news for the Democrats is
also completely fake propaganda well
that's true that seems to be true but
people don't lose hope because the money
in politics and the media are just two
variables that's just two variables
there's a lot more that goes into voting
than just the money and the media okay
it might be 60% of it but there's still
there's still more
let's see over on oan the network uh
they had election fraud researcher in
former California lawmaker Steve Baldwin
and he''s been looking into uh the
Georgia voter roles this these are the
people who are registered to vote in
Georgia here are some things he claims
to have found 179,000 voters with
incomplete addresses that would be like
missing apartment unit or Suite numbers
which be a little suspicious
but hey that's just you know one
variable uh also 115,000 voters used
invalid mailing address oh H 114,000
that's like way more than the number of
people that determine the election in
that state
huh and then there are 79,000 people who
somehow managed to register on a Federal
holiday and the question would be
how'd you do
that I don't know maybe there's some
kind of time delay on that or
something and uh 69,000 voters
permanently moved on state but still
remain on the
roles uh
really okay well I don't have
verification that all of these things
are true they're just a whole bunch of
claims that the voter roles are so
polluted that it would be somewhat
trivially easy for a bad actor to be
collecting all these ballots and getting
people to vote who should not be voting
and of course they would never be caught
because it wouldn't be one big Scandal
it would just be a bunch of individual
voters who yeah maybe they shouldn't
have voted but it's not like one big
problem it's just a whole bunch of
individual little things you know you
could ignore the little things can't you
all right so we don't have voter
roles and the media is rigged
and the funding is
rigged but at least we have law
enforcement to make sure that
everything's running fine all right
here's a new story do you know cisa cisa
where is it cisa cisa and the
FBI uh they they've got a warning on
Election data whoa listen to this
apparently they have some information
that suggests something's coming they
say uh they they did a public service
now an ment how how useful this is to
aware to raise awareness there might be
a denial of service attack on Election
infrastructure oh that sounds bad that
could hinder access to election
information well that sounds
bad hackers could hinder our access to
election
information oh but it's okay it's okay
they say it would not impact the
security or Integrity of the election
process oh so the voting would be fine
the only problem would be if you tried
to find out how people
voted after the fact you know sort of
like auditing or something like
that
huh so it's looking exactly like they're
they're warning us that they're not
going to let us audit the
election that's what I see and they're
going to blame it on a
hacker h
so all right so maybe the FBI and cesa
are actually malign actors because they
apparently are preparing to lie to us
later and sure the election voter roles
are completely polluted which would
suggest it would be easy to rig and yes
the media is completely a propaganda
outfit and certainly the funding
is some kind of moneya laundering
operation
so but anyway those are just a few
things just just a few things but there
are lots of other elements to election
for example uh back in 2019 then Senator
Harris according to Fox News um talked
about the sizable contributions in swing
states of having all these illegal
immigrants oh so she admitted in 2019
that the plan was to bring in illegal
immigrants to change the voting in the
swing
States okay so we have illegal
immigration to change the swing straight
votes we've got the FBI saying there's
going to be some kind of fake attack
that will allow us not to audit the
elections the voter roles seem to be
rigged in Georgia and the funding is
fake
and the media is full of
propaganda Now That's What I Call
democracy
people yeah and you know what you don't
want you don't want Trump to come in
here and steal your democracy am my
right I mean look how good things are
set up everything looks perfectly good
to me the only thing that could go wrong
with this magnificent system we have is
if somebody like Trump comes in and
steals your
democracy and by the way the Democrats
are very clear about how he's going to
do it you know that right they're very
clear about how Trump will steal your
democracy should I tell you what you
don't know it's a very clear
plan he's
uh change the subject
no there is no plan to steal your
democracy well but least the one thing
we can count on is that the people who
are protecting our candidates are doing
their very best and you're getting a
really good safe Secret Service
situation according to Breitbart News
there was a rasmuson poll that said 41%
of Voters believe Federal officials were
involved in the Trump assassination
attempt okay so the credibility of our
government is so low that 41% of the
public thinks the Government tried to
murder
Trump
so but don't worry there are only a few
things that look like they're a little
sketchy the voter roles the propaganda
from the media the fake funding the FBI
warning us that they're going to hide
the audit
information the fact that they're
bringing in people specifically and
directly to alter the swing state
populations and the fact that 41%
believe that the government literally
tried to kill one of the
candidates you know what's looking like
a beacon of democracy
today
Venezuela do you think Venezuela had
this many problems
s now I don't suspect that the Venezuela
vote was
real but did they have this many
problems I'm not sure they did did
anybody try to murder one of their
candidates I don't recall
that well if you put it all together my
current prediction is that we won't have
an election this year we will have
people voting there will be an election
day
and people will vote and votes will be
counted when it's done whichever side
lost will say that was no election that
was a sham and the results must be
thrown out uh and here's my fake slative
electors and everything else I don't
think our current system gives us any
chance of an election result that the
country
accepts would you disagree with that our
current setup is so sketchy and so
really non-credible the whole system is
has no credibility at all that if your
side loses you're going to think it was
cheating and you'll be right I think
you'd be
right and by the way that probably works
both ways you know if somehow the
Republicans have figured out some clever
but legal way to game the
system what do you think Democrats are
going to say the they're going to say
they're going to say that Hitler just
took over and they're going to do
everything they can to take Trump out of
office they're going to impeach them on
day one if they can if they have the
votes um and they're going to be
marching in the streets and the cities
will
burn the cities are going to burn if
Trump wins I mean I think that's
guaranteed and not because of trump
because the bad guys want power so
they're going to make it look like the
citizens can't live with this president
and it won't be real it'll be fake like
BLM and antifa it'll just be funded by
the usual people and then of course
there'll be another Charlottesville
March right away and everybody will be
Fooled Again into thinking that was
organic it
wasn't whatever it was it definitely
wasn't
organic
anyway
um uh so Trump has agreed to debate K
Harris on September
4th I do think the Harris has a
reasonably good chance of doing well in
the debate and the only reason I say it
is that there's no back and forth so she
will be asked a question and then
Trump's microphone will be muted I
suppose and then she will just read from
her little you know or she'll have a
memorized answer to every topic and then
she'll just do her memorized answer and
you'll say oh that sounded pretty good
that was coherent and it'll just be
memorized and then they'll go to Trump
and he'll make some terrible
accusation and then she won't
necessarily respond to it
directly she will also um she'll just
say what she says about the topic and
then when it's done the media will say
my God that was a masterful you know I
don't know why people said she's not
good at this she's the greatest debater
she got she had her prosecutor hat on
and the media will say that she won in a
landslide even if she
didn't so I I think her odds are doing
well are pretty high but there's also a
good chance that she gets derailed by
something that happens and you know
can't answer a question so we still want
to see her sit down for a real interview
with a real reporter I don't think it's
going to happen I think she's going to
get the George Stephanopoulos
treatment where she probably knows the
questions I I don't know that that's
true but you kind of suspect she might
know the questions so she just goes into
a friendly interview with the answers
prepared and they just come right out by
the way did you hear hear her uh her
phone call with her
supporters where she was talking about I
guess receiving enough support to be the
nominee and she does this phone call and
she reads
it can you believe that she did a phone
call where she read a speech she read a
speech into a phone call
now some of it of course you would
expect to be you know prepared but
wouldn't you expect a whole bunch of
extemporaneous
comments and then maybe she'd say oh and
I just want to read this little
statement so we're all clear apparently
she couldn't do that do you think Trump
would have just read a statement not a
chance he would have talked for 10
minutes and then he would say if he had
time left oh let me read the statement
completely different level of
communication ability completely
different
um so the hill says that Trump risks
losing more black voters with this
Harris identity attacks you know the
question about whether she's black or is
she indian-american or both and I think
this is propaganda from the hill Trump
Lo RIS losing more black
voters here's what I wonder do you think
that the
black men and the black women feel the
same about this because I'll bet not and
and I think that by hiding the fact that
the black men and the black women may be
diverging in terms of trump support I
think they're hiding that I think
they're hiding the ball because the big
story is men versus women and the media
they don't want to say it directly
because they're going to lose all their
men in the Democrat Party at least the
ones that still has some
testosterone
anyway
um so Elon Musk revealed on his Lex
Friedman interview that he talked to
Trump about creating a government
efficiency commission to make the
government efficient and that he would
actually be interested in being on it
now that doesn't mean it'll
happen but it's a hell of an idea do you
know who did that first a government
Commission on making the government more
efficient Al Gore so when Al Gore was
vice president his job was to
essentially automate the government and
make it so that you could just go online
and get your your work done and over
time we've seen that the federal
government has moved a lot of stuff
online it is more efficient in that way
anyway but a lot of work to do on that
so that would be fun
um so open AI who makes chat gbt says
the government's going to see their new
version Chad G pt5 before anyone
else hold that in your mind so open
AI has an association or arrangement
with the government where their new
version and this one is you know rumored
to be super smart compared to the
current one um that the government has
to see a her first why do you suppose
that
is do you there is let me say it
again no government can survive an
honest news environment that's why there
are no honest news
environments the no government
Democratic no government dictator none
if if the if the news started telling
the truth it'd be hard to stay in power
uh hard to win an election so you really
need at least some part of the news to
be
completely you know illegitimate
otherwise you can't stay in
power so when you see that the AI which
will be in the future will be our only
source of information everything you
know in the future will be talking to AI
you're not going to Google search for
stuff if AI can just do it for you
so I think the government needs to
control ai's
answers and it needs to make sure the AI
will brainwash you the way you have been
brainwashed so far and they got to make
sure that it doesn't tell you the truth
because no Government Can can handle the
truth in the long
run so I think this is exactly what it
looks like it's the government forcing
open AI to add lies to their
algorithm otherwise they won't be
allowed to
operate I don't know it can't really go
any other way by the way so if you're
thinking to yourself well that's too far
Scott it can't actually go any other way
the government cannot
survive guarantee they can't survive if
AI is just honest and tell us the truth
that that's the reason that all of your
searches are so obviously you know
brainwashing
propaganda government can't survive with
the
truth um Warren Buffett's Brookshire
hathway apparently is sold a bunch of
its
Apple stuff in the second quarter now I
also sold much of my Apple steak in the
second quarter I don't know if their
reason is the same as mine but to me
Apple went from kind of a monopoly that
nobody could touch to something closer
to a jump ball because of AI so Apple
still is not nailing their AI strategy
they might
I mean if you had to bet I'd be more
likely to bet they do than don't but at
the
moment um they look weak and I would
guess that some
upstart could come up with a phone that
uses AI as its you know base mechanism
and just put them in a
business so I I don't give uh stock
advice so I'm not telling you to sell
your Apple if I had held mine I would
have made a lot more money money because
it's much higher than when I sold it so
if you take my advice on individual
companies to to invest in you will be
taking bad advice I guarantee you I'm
bad at this I want everybody hear that
just in case you think I'm secretly
giving you advice I'm not because I'm
bad at
it right everybody's bad at individual
companies all
right well Journal had a big article on
Robbie
Starbuck and how he's been successful in
getting John Deere to scrap its Dei
program or at least deemphasize it and
uh I guess he's going to go after some
other companies and what I find
important about the story is not just
the John Deere part but what I find
important is that the counterforce to
Dei is now legitimate enough that they
can do it in public and the Wall Street
Journal can write a
what I think is a complimentary feature
piece so just imagine that somebody is
public as an anti- Dei person and the
news is treating you as notable positive
influence in the world so that's pretty
important so that's good and that ladies
and gentlemen is all that's happening
today I'm expecting some more big news
to come over the weekend
maybe Iran maybe something
else um yeah right now as soon as uh
your Apple can directly access both your
Apple and your Amazon Digital devices
they don't access AI which is just crazy
I mean it already seems just hard to
understand really but apparently Amazon
will you'll be able to talk to it with
AI which will be life changing for me
because all day long I talk to my
digital devices I'm always asking them
about the the weather and the stock
market and read the local news and uh
but you know it gets so many things
wrong that it's a pain in the ass so as
soon as it can actually have a
conversation with me I don't know if
I'll ever leave the house
again all
right the uh Kyle writtenhouse
controversy no interest at
all I will note that there's a Kyle
writtenhouse
controversy at one point he said he
wasn't going to support Trump some
people saying he changed his mind
something about the Second
Amendment he's one young guy it doesn't
matter a bit who who he's in favor of
nobody's taking what is he in his early
20s nobody's taking the the advice or
the guidance or the word of somebody
who's in his early
20s that's just his opinion why do we
care so I think we should care less uh
we should insult him less we should
compliment him less we should just care
less he his opinion is not better than
yours it's not more important than yours
so he's just a person with an opinion no
interest at
all now here's another thing I'm
watching which is the number of
Presidential polls that leave out the
third
parties why do we ever have a poll that
leaves out RFK Jr how does that make
sense well how does it make sense to
leave out the third
party because you know they're going to
be there right that I don't think
there's any chance that RFK Jr won't be
on
the on the at least on the ballot in a
lot of places if not all of them
all right so it's yeah so I think you're
going to see rigged polls rigged funding
rigged media rigged voter polls rigged
uh immigration
resettlement and maybe a rigged auditing
process after the fact you know what you
still haven't seen you've still never
seen an expert come on any show to
explain uh the holes in the system if
there are any
I would love to see Lex Friedman
or Joe
Rogan or Jordan
Peterson maybe uh Ben Shapiro or
somebody so somebody who really knows
that ask some questions you know not
just your average talking head they're
not good enough you need somebody extra
smart so you need a a Lex or you need a
you know you need somebody smart and
here are the type of questions you
should ask
if somebody filled down a ballot and
they were not a citizen they mailed it
in how would you catch
it how how carefully do you check the
signatures what percentage of people who
have the wrong address are people who
you should let vote because they just
wrote down the address wrong you
wouldn't want to deny them versus it's
an obvious signal that these are not
real people when the address is
wrong how do you how do you do that if
somebody wanted to run the same ballots
through the system twice how would you
catch it so in other words you should
have a whole bunch of questions that are
Loosely based on things that people have
been allegedly caught for Cheating in
the past so you wouldn't have to make
something up you could just say all
right suppose a state
actor uh hacked the
machines how would you catch them and
then you'd hear something like oh you
know we'd easily catch that and I say no
no a state actor you don't think a state
actor could get in there and change some
results and get out without getting
caught a state actor like the the best
hackers from you know a major
industrialized
country it can't be that
hard the hackers are into every other
system the the all caps people Scott is
dead effing wrong
again do you notice that the people who
are the most angry will never say what
it is that I got
wrong it's fairly consistent your anger
seems to be about me and not any of my
opinions how do I know because you would
say what it was I got wrong if that were
real but no you're just here to yell in
all caps we got everything wrong he
needs to study up on
topic but it must it must be nice to be
drunk and pathetic at this time of the
day how many of you are uh drunk already
I think the all caps people are just
always
drunk do do you think anybody writes an
all caps message unless they're
drunk seems like a
guarantee all right the anti
anti-Semitism is broiling in the
comments just broiling
today um you realize that the the
Shapiro nomination could be a
trap and the trap could be to get all of
the
anti-semitic uh people on the right to
complain about him being
Jewish that would be one way for the
Democrats to win to trick the the
conservatives
into saying he can't be a good vice
president because he visited Israel that
time that would be a good way to give
away the election and it looks like
you're all going to fall for that trap
not all of you but probably you know
some huge percentage of conservatives
going to fall right into that
trap all right that's all I got for you
today I'm going to try to talk to the
locals people privately but thanks for
joining on X and YouTube and Rumble and
if this works I will be going private
just with local supporters in 5
seconds
