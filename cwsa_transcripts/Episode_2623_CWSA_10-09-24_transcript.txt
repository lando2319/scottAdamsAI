okay you know what I love is when a
stock that I sold a long time ago goes
down I shouldn't enjoy it when a stock
goes down but it's only if it's one that
I already sold a long time ago so I
guess I'm not a good person is the
bottom
line all
right let's
find there you
go now we've got it all together
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time in your
whole darn life but if you'd like to
take it up to a level that nobody's ever
seen with their tiny shiny human brains
all you need is a gupper muger glass a
tanker cheles a can you Jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dope me of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go the technology is working thank you
Paul well if you're not subscribed to
Dilbert reborn which you can only see if
you're a member of locals at Scott
adams. locals.com or or you can be
subscribing on the
xplatform if you only want the comic
over at locals we do political stuff
too but if you were reading the Dilbert
reborn you would know that uh Dilbert's
company is taking a lesson from p
didy uh I can say no more say no more
let's just say that b Diddy did really
well in business and the pointy aired
boss has noticed and so he's going to
try to see what he can learn see if he
can pick up any business tips from
p and uh I can't tell you how this works
out but just I'll give you one
hint uh a shook the
intern it doesn't go well for him that's
all you need to know all right next
story uh according to Oxford University
Health caffeine is linked to better
vascular health oh yeah if you're
feeling stronger it's because of me you
had an extra sip because you're watching
this you're a little bit heart healthier
than you were a moment ago that's called
science meanwhile
scientists something called IFL science
is reporting that they gave rats some
psilocybin no magic mushrooms and the
Rats became more optimistic became more
optimistic
now you might ask yourself why do I want
to make my rats more
optimistic and I think the obvious
answer is do you want sad
rats I mean it's bad enough if you have
a
rat but do you want a sad one no you
want happy one so they give them
mushrooms and make them happy I think
they're thinking there might be some
connection to making humans happy but I
don't know I think take the
win if you made some rats happy that's
not nothing I like happy
rats uh there's a new kind of 3D
printing according to Concordia
University that I don't understand
exactly but they call a holographic 3D
printing and
involves
sound uh using acoustic
Holograms so in other words somehow they
can concentrate sound waves and then the
sound waves will be the force that puts
the materials into its
shape but you know what's cool about it
because it's sound waves you could
actually create something on the other
side of a
barrier so you could actually 3D create
something inside somebody's body without
opening them
up now I guess you'd have to have some
material that you got inside the body
one way or the other so maybe you have
to open them up to put some 3D print in
material in their body but once it's in
there then they can put in the sound
waves and actually turn it into
something like a heart valve or some
damn thing once it's already in your
body now I don't know if there'll ever
be an application for that but there is
some thinking that this will completely
change 3D printing that'd be cool that's
getting a lot closer to the replicator
and Star Trek because it' be one thing
to see you know the replicator do that
printing one like at a
time you wait forever but imagine if
they could just Sho some sound waves at
something and you just see a form like
forming as a a solid that would be
completely different anyway that's on
the
way so the uh is she the president I
guess that would be the title of Italy
Georgia Milani she's uh she's in court
um because she's trying to get deep
fakes that pornographic of her band so
she doesn't want people to make deep
fake porn of her apparently they
exist and
uh she says it's a form of
violence now this opens up many deep and
interesting questions number one I can
certainly see your point if you made a
porn of a public figure and you put it
online uh you could see how if you were
a woman especially it would seem like
effectively violence right it would be
sort of a psychological violence but
violence uh and I can see the point I I
completely understand that now I don't
know if it'd be the same for
man um but I'm willing to find out so if
if anybody wants to make if anybody
wants to make an x-rated porno involving
me uh go ahead
I promise I won't I won't accuse you of
violence just just be generous that's
all I'm asking just be
generous now there's no it's no laughing
matter if this is done to you know a
woman or somebody's who's underage
obviously this is a sort of crime that's
not going to hit every victim the same
uh in my case it would just be funny but
you could certainly see how if you were
a woman or especially if you were a
minor uh it would be devastating so
don't make uh we're not going to make
fun of it um unless it's about me and
then you can make fun of
it but this raises a question so you've
all seen that AI can take some real
person and then put them in a scene
we've seen that it can take real people
like a photograph of a person and turn
it into into a talking kind of an
icon is there yet
an app where you can take a picture of
the woman who turned you down and then
turn her into your permanent digital
girlfriend does that exist because it
feels like only the parts exist like
there's one app that can make somebody
talk there's another app that can make
it look like the picture that you gave
it and probably there's a third thing
that doesn't do either of those two
things that can turn it into a like a
conversational app I don't think we're
yet at the point where you could just
take the photograph from Facebook of the
the girl that you know rejected you in
in high school and it just turned her
into your digital girlfriend now here's
my question obviously that will exist
would you agree there's no way around
that people will absolutely be taking
real real life photographs of people
sometimes they don't even know which is
somebody they they like and turning it
into their digital
servant
now is that a
crime suppose you're just doing it for
personal use suppose you took a real
life person took a photo even added
their let's say there's some audio of
them so you add even their voice if you
create a whole digital sex slave that's
based very closely on a real person
person does the real person have any
claim against you or should
they this is such un such new
territory that it's it's hard to imagine
even how you'd respond to it but but
here's the part that you can know for
sure 100% sure people will be taking
pictures of real people and turning them
into digital sex slaves and
companions why wouldn't they
if you had the technology and it was
just an app and all you had to do is
feed it a picture or a video why
wouldn't you like I I don't even know
the argument for not doing it of course
you would if you were lonely and you
wanted to wanted something to keep you
company you might as well make it
something you like a little extra why
wouldn't
you well anyway uh CNN is reporting that
uh it's not true that the Afghan
refugees that have been coming into the
country since the Afghan war w wound
down with the United States it's not
true that the Afghan refugees have not
been adequately vetted so all you people
are saying oh they're letting in a bunch
of Afghans and some of them might be
terrorists CNN is here to tell you in a
big headline it is not true not true
that the Afghans have not been
effectively vetted also CNN would like
you to know that an Afghan National
Refugee has been charged with uh
planning a mass murder on Election
Day so I suppose you can pick either one
of those
headlines one of them is
true either they were carefully vetted
or there's an Afghan Refugee who just
got caught plotting a mass murder on
Election Day one of those is definitely
true so
50/50 not
bad um the question I have is how many
disasters will we have around election
day um probably
hurricanes uh we got the monkey pox uh
the Isis terrorist attack that was
thwarted but maybe there's some more
maybe something with drones maybe World
War II maybe something
nuclear
earthquake rods from God space lasers
UFO
contact I don't think we have any idea
how wild things are going to get
but I'll tell you one thing no matter
what happens on its own like just
naturally it was a coincidence we're
going to blame on somebody if there's an
earthquake you know we're going to be
talking about the cia's technology for
triggering earthquakes you know we are
right so if there's a solar
flare somebody's going to say that
there's CIAA technology that can create
a solar flare and that's not it's no
accident that happened on election day
if it
does meanwhile Tik tok's getting more
lawsuits uh I guess 14 States and it's
bipartisan so this is not just Democrats
and not just Republicans it's both uh
getting together because I think Tik
tok's dangerous for young
people why is Tik Tok even available for
young people
minors why yeah I feel like there's
almost Universal agreement that it's bad
for young people below you know maybe
you could pick 16 as your starting age
but is there anybody who disagrees with
that now I guess there's a you know Free
Speech element to it but does that apply
to children do children have free speech
I'm pretty sure they can't stand up in
class and start cursing you know there
there's limits on what kids can do so
it's weird that this is even a question
but but uh I have a feeling that whoever
wants to keep Tik Tock alive has a lot
of power maybe it's our intelligence
people maybe they want to keep it alive
so they can eventually control it I
don't know meanwhile uh have you heard
of the the app called
Roblox if you if you're haven't been
around young kids for a while you've
maybe never even heard of it but wow
Roblox is a sort of a what do you call
it a
a sort of a social media game mask game
app where you can acquire building parts
and build yourself a little home and get
some furniture and interact with the
other people now if you've ever seen a
child who is playing
Roblox there's something completely
hypnotizing about it you should see the
eyes of anybody who just played you the
the eyes are just completely hypnotized
I don't know what it is about it I
haven't I haven't spent even a minute
looking at it but wow if you if you've
seen any kid stand up and walk away from
Roblox just look at their eyes there is
something going on with that thing like
I I watch that you know watch that AFF
one person in particular and I thought I
don't even believe what I'm seeing the
the level of
addiction was beyond anything I've ever
seen on social media it's it was a video
game I I guess you'd say it's a video
game level addiction it's pretty strong
but the latest news is uh something
called the Hindenburg report says that
the uh the app is a uh a pedophile
hellscape
so I guess if you build a platform where
it's mostly kids interacting you're
going to get a lot of people who are not
kids so not a big surprise this is the
post millennial the post millennial is
reporting on this so there's there stock
plunged and they've got some financial
problems
anyway well I'm wondering if the reports
or the allegations about Doug emof KL
Harris's husband I'm wondering if those
reports are getting to anybody on the
left because if they had concerns about
Donald Trump's interactions with
women they would really have a problem
with the Doug mhof stories if they're
true now keep in mind there there's
going to be a theme to Today's Show
which is that none of the first person
reports a month before an election or
true or at least you shouldn't give them
credibility I'm need to talk about a
number of stories in the news that are
all well somebody said there is a report
from a Anonymous person uh to be fair I
think we have to give the same treatment
to mhof which is I'll tell you what the
allegations are because it's political
so therefore it's important to know what
the allegations are are they
true well they would be within the
lowest credibility domain they might be
true also some of the other stories I'm
going to tell you about that I don't
think are true might be they might be
it's just you shouldn't believe them if
the only evidence you have is that it's
a it's a month before an election and
somebody who doesn't give their name is
making a claim about
somebody I'm sorry that is the lowest
level of
credibility
but um the reports coming in is that is
he worked at a law
firm and uh the attorneys who worked
with him said he was uh misogynist and
had men only cocktail hours and he would
not be he would flirt with all the women
and uh he would revoke work perks for
anybody who didn't flirt
back and uh he hired attractive
assistants because they were
attractive um if I could summarize that
um all the all that behavior uh I'm
going to summarize it all for
you and the summary is uh Doug
mhof once worked at a law firm
which actually captures all of the other
Behavior does anybody work in a law firm
do any of you work for a law
firm I want to see if you agree with my
summary summary he worked for a law
firm
no I don't think it's too far off it's
not too far off I've got a feeling your
law firms are
not not exactly the most uh polite
places to work all right well here's
another thing that um I'm trying to
fight off the persuasive effects I'm
completely aware that the average
citizen in the United States has never
seen any news report about anything in
our
elections that looked like it was
fraudulent probably the vast majority of
citizens have never even seen one story
of anything current where an election
was you know a little bit
questionable but if you if you uh live
in the right leaning you know Silo as I
do you see them all day long so I think
I saw four of them today four different
stories of either the election roles had
to be corrected or somebody's suing to
make a change that they know needs to be
changed but somebody's resisting there's
a door that needs to be unlocked because
there might be some bad ballots back
there but they won't unlock the door
there's a new lawsuit that got turned
down for reasons that sound technical
but maybe the the allegation was true
and all day long I'm hearing this now
and they're different states it's not
like it's one situation it's all
different states and they usually the
swing States
Etc and you know here's another one
let's see uh Oregon according to Fox
News mistakenly registered hundreds more
voters and then the last minute they
cleaned it up they've cleaned up over
about
1,600 mistaken
registrations now that's just the stuff
they
caught if all day long I'm hearing
stories about well we we caught a th000
in this state but we fixed it and then
the next day well there are 20,000 were
a little questionable but we couldn't
fix it and all if you hear that all day
long you wouldn't possibly think that
our elections are secure and
accurate but if You' never heard any of
these stories you'd say well I would
have heard if there was a
problem somebody would have told me I'm
sure it would have been in the news it
is in the news but not your
news so I don't have any opinion about
this specific report it's just that
there are a lot of
them uh but on the positive sign on the
positive uh end
yeah I'm I'm going to give you this
recommendation again just because I like
boosting the uh
independent um
news but if you're not following the
account on X called George just one word
George uh he go his uh handle is beesy
tweets b b i z y tweets anyway he does
some of the best reporting every day I
don't know how I don't know exactly
how he's doing it or if somebody's
backing him or what but um almost every
day I tell you something story that I
only heard from him so here's one of
them um there's a project called move
the
needle uh and it's in Milwaukee and
where uh people are going door Todo in
black neighborhoods specifically trying
to quote I don't like this word but
educate black voters on why they must
vote for Trump I would have used used a
different word than educate maybe
persuade or something
but
um here's my take on that I feel as if
people are wising up to the fact that
100% of election or political stuff they
see on their glowing screens is absolute
 would you agree so even the
things that agree with me you know
especially this month even if it's like
something to be positive for Trump I at
it and go yeah yeah but you know and a
context right so it's not like it's not
like the stuff that agrees with you is
true and the other side got everything
wrong we don't live in that world we
live in a world where most of what you
see is that in context or if
has any political element to it and
certainly anything involving a
war you completely nonsense
reporting but uh here's my take if
people do give up on the glowing screens
and the internet and the News being the
persuasive things in person is
stronger so if you can get a human being
to stand in front of you and you allow
them to talk for a little while and you
maybe you're undecided or you have some
confusion about what's true and what's
not it could be super persuasive if the
people doing it are trained to be
persuasive
and so I have two comments on this
number one it's an excellent
experiment to find out if it worked
because if it does work you could easily
imagine that the election process is
just armies of people trying to persuade
other people now there's always some of
that but we seem to leave it to the news
to inform I think we're going to lose
that
model I think the you know the
foreshadowing that you can see already
is that people are going to say I just
need to talk to another person who's
done the work and then I can ask some
questions of the person and that
probably works so I'd love to know if it
is successful but if they're well
trained it probably is and I would like
to add this point correct me if I'm
wrong compared to let's say
2015 Republicans have grown an army of
trained
persuaders true or
false the the number of Republicans
specifically
Republicans who have learned
persuasion well enough to apply it in
the political context
successfully is way
different because people like me are
literally training people you know I
I've probably personally trained a
100,000 Republicans and had to be more
persuasive but also how to recognize
propaganda how how to identify lies but
mostly how to persuade somebody
so what happens if I train 100,000
persuaders and they go out and just have
conversations with 100,000 people I
probably makes a difference probably
makes a difference I remember in the
first Trump election uh after the
election I asked how many of you changed
your vote to Trump because of something
I said and even though this was a highly
you know unscientific it was just a poll
on what was Twitter uh I think 1,500
people responded and said I changed
their vote now keep in mind that if 1500
people said yes that wasn't an opinion
they weren't giving an opinion they were
saying yes I was going to vote the other
way you changed my mind 1,500 and that's
only the ones who saw the poll and
responded now what's the real
number well I don't know but it's
probably in the tens of thousand
I I wouldn't be surprised if I
moved a six-digit number of people over
100,000 maybe no way to know but uh yeah
the Republicans have a major advantage
in that there are people like me who are
literally training them how to be good
persuaders that's not happening on the
other
side and it might not be able to be
possible on the other side because if
Democrats were trained on propaganda and
persuasion
they would recognize that it's happening
to
them but the Democrat persuasion is sort
of standard political stuff so even if
you see it you just say oh I get it
Trump is uh exaggerating again it
doesn't mean anything but if you were a
Democrat you'd be finding out that the
Democrats made up entire stories and got
all the press to sell them like the fine
people hoax so if Democrats find out how
the game is played they're going to
abandon
Democrats if Republicans find out how
the game is played they're going to say
oh my side tells some Tales too but I'm
just going to you know that's just sort
of normal business but the other side
just got the intelligence Community to
sign something that was a lie that's a
whole different level that is these are
not the same that's not the same Trump
says his crowd size is bigger than you
think it is and compared to uh the
Russia collusion hoax that lasted years
and tried to remove a president these
are not the same no 51 Intel people
signing the hoax letter about hunter's
laptop no no Republicans ever done that
there's nothing since at least I've seen
nothing since 2015 at least in which
anybody Republican has done anything
like that the the whole fine people
hoax just nothing like that on the other
side you there there are some
stories on the right that are generally
believed but they're not like made up as
a as a hoax it's just people come to
believe things that they come to
believe anyway there's a report on uh
MSNBC that Trump tried to weaponize the
IRS against Comey and McCabe when he was
back when he was in office now this
comes because of uh General uh Kelly
said that uh Trump said behind closed
doors to use the IRS to go after
them now here's the test to see if I've
successfully trained you for spotting
propaganda and it's remember
you have to know who the players are
remember rule number one the story is
not the story it's never the
story and indeed even people who want
you to hear the wrong story might be
accurately given giving you the details
of the story but the story is never the
story it's the people involved that's
the story right because depending Who's
involved it gives you a completely
different image all right let's say
let's say that the story that uh Trump
wanted to use the IRS to go after his
political enemies let's say that came
from Don Jr and he said it out loud in
public many times times Well if that
happened which did not happen I would
have said oh well because of the
source that looks pretty reliable like I
don't know why you'd be saying that but
it must be true right because the source
would tell you everything now know that
it's General
Kelly now do you believe it do you
believe it's correct and in the proper
context well you shouldn't you shouldn't
because he would not be within the
context of this story he's not a
reliable source now it doesn't matter
that this one is bad for Trump if you
reverse this and it was something on the
other side but you knew that the
character it came from couldn't be
trusted or or had a an ax to grind with
the person they were talking about you
shouldn't believe it at all yeah so I
would say it's coming from MSNBC they
are a propaganda platform pretending to
be news and by the way when I say that
that's not an
exaggeration MSNBC is a propaganda
platform by Design By Design they didn't
accidentally drift into
it and they're pretending to be news
that's what makes the propaganda work
and then the person that they're
using you know it's a somebody said
something behind closed doors and I
can't prove it yeah no you should give
this zero credibility now I don't know
if it's
true and I can't know there's probably
no way to know if it's true but I would
treat it like it's not because it's
coming from the lowest credibility kind
of a
source all right
um what else we got going on uh
apparently there was no wrongdoing found
by some Inspector General so you've got
the report of this Badness but then some
people looked into it and said no we
didn't see anything so it's kind of a
it's the weakest of the weakest reports
and it's exactly the kind of thing you
could have predicted because I did I did
predict it that you would see all these
uh Anonymous or sketchy reports of
something that somebody heard behind a
closed
door those you're going to get more of
those
probably all right let's talk about the
Hurricanes you know hurricane Milton
coming toward Florida and Helen messed
up the center of the country there North
Carolina and Milton so bad this got like
almost a mini hurricane in front of the
real hurricane there's like a storm in
front of the storm and it's been as high
as a category five I think it's down to
four but it's still super dangerous it's
going to bring gigantic
flooding um and the real question that
everybody keeps asking me is Scott do
you think that bad people made these
hurricanes worse or aim them using their
secret hurricane technology and sure
enough just like the UFO stories there's
a credible sounding person who's willing
to talk to Congress to say that he's a
whistleblower and he knows for sure that
the United States can manipulate the
weather and there's no doubt about it
that Helen was manipulated and aimed and
intensified so it Go tear up North
Carolina
so what do you
think and the the story is that we have
we I guess the CIA or somebody defense
department somebody has some secret
technology for rapidly intensifying
hurricanes and we've seen them rapidly
intensify in ways that we haven't seen
before so clearly it's that now I don't
know if this is just the the uh the
story that's trying to counter the fact
that it might be climate
change you know if we say it's a if it
was done by people then we don't have to
accept that hey is this climate change
doing anything by the way I don't think
there's evidence that climate change is
a
problem uh allow me to tell you what the
news told you about climate change and
the hurricane you ready here are things
the news told you it looks like climate
change made it worse because it's one of
the worst it's one of the top five
hurricanes in the last I don't know 50
years do you see any problem with
that climate change made it
worse and so much worse is one of the
top five
hurricanes do you see the
problem if it's in the top five it means
that they happen on their own
how did the other top five get in
there were they all caused by climate
change no if it's only in the top five
it's not even the top one then the
obvious conclusion is that this kind of
hurricane happens on its
own now if it has like a special
character that no hurricane has ever had
before well now you have my attention
now you have my attention so we could
talk about you know any specific Oddity
of it that's fair game I'll listen to
that argument but just the fact that
it's one of the worst
no it's not unusual to get something
that's in the top five that is not
indication of anything but there might
be some weird things about these I just
don't know so I've been asked do I
believe that uh these have been
manipulated hurricanes uh I would say 5%
chance so I'm not going to give it a
zero
because it's sort of in the category of
well anything's
possible I doubt it um here are the
things that I don't doubt I don't doubt
that you can make it rain more than it
was going to
rain so if you see the clouds that seems
like acceptable stuff I don't
doubt that there have been experiments
and maybe more than experiments of
trying to put something in the
atmosphere that would dull the uh the
impact of the Sun for climate change I
think that's real at least in the
Prototype phase and I think it's been
tested somewhere but do you think they
have technology using lasers or whatnot
to steer a storm here's what I think
it's probably been
studied and there might even be a
theoretical way to do it but if do I
think that Americans to let's say change
the outcome of an election used
hurricane modification to create a mass
murder in the United States to change
the election
outcomes I say
no I'm going to go with 95% no and it's
sort of the same 95% that I put on the
UFOs not being
real because the the nature of the of
the the people who are saying I'm a
whistle blower I can tell you for sure
it's real it looks like the same people
to me like they're not the same but they
could be if you sat them down next to
each other you put the UFO whistleblower
next to the hurricane modification
whistleblower you would think you're
talking to the same guy now I'm
not going to ignore
that that that the whistleblowers have
this this kind of vibe to them if you
know what I mean and their stories all
sound the same whether it's a earthquake
or a I'm sorry whether it's a hurricane
or UFO they they sound the same when
they're telling the story I can't ignore
that I know so I'm going to say uh
no uh now now I'm seeing the angry
people saying God Scott on some subjects
you're so
obtuse well here's the context you
should look at compare all the things
that I've predicted publicly to all the
things you've predicted
publicly and maybe you should get a
little bit more humble about how certain
you are that you know that there's
earthquake or or hurricane
modifications now I'm allowing you the
5% because I don't rule it out it could
be could be I mean there have been
horrible things that have happened in
history this just seems unlikely all
right so I'm going to say unlikely I do
believe I do believe that our government
has looked into it I do believe they may
have even tested something that's
possible I do believe they may have a
theoretical weapon that would that would
be really bad if they Unleashed it on an
enemy I don't believe they tested it on
the United
States I don't believe anybody ran a
hurricane through the middle of the
country for a strategic reason
I don't believe that all right but uh I
will accept that many of you are
spring-loaded to believe
that um 60 Minutes had some propaganda
on um I assume 60 Minutes is primarily a
propaganda platform um that's just what
it looks like it doesn't look like it's
trying to be news sort of an MSNBC
situation uh it looks like it's purely
before controlling the public opinion
here's an example so they had on
somebody named Shelby Bush and she
believes that the 2020 election was
rigged so how do you think 60 Minutes
treated her and why do you think they
had her on before the election do you
think it was to take seriously her
claims and really dig into them and see
if they have
substance or is it to ask a question
like why do you believe in a conspiracy
theory
oh it's the
latter yeah so the
questioner uh basically has a total
attitude and saying you but why why do
you believe in the conspiracy theories
now if somebody goes on TV and tells you
something is a conspiracy theory that is
propaganda if it had not been propaganda
if if it had not been the intention of
it simply to make it look like nobody in
their right mind could think the
election was
that's the point of it right they're
trying to make sure that we don't claim
it in this coming election by demonizing
people who claimed it in the last
election it's not news it's not news
it's
propaganda so they're setting the stage
and they're priming you do you want to
be treated like Shelby was because she
said in public she thought the election
wasn't real in 20120
so you know you might be next one who
stopped by 60 minutes to be told that
you're a conspiracy theorist in front of
the whole world so that they can ruin
your
life yeah to me it looks like it's just
a shot across the bow to warn people not
to complain about the election which is
another way of telling me that they plan
to steal it not confirmed but the
message I get from 60 minutes is that
they're part of a network of people who
know that the election is going to be
stolen and they want to put down some
suppressive fire so that when you do
challenge it you know that you're going
up against strong forces and that you
might be jailed like the J Sixers or you
might be maligned and defamed like
Shelby
bushes here are the tells the fact that
the questioner labels or a conspiracy
theorist is all you need to know the
average person who watches any kind of
news related show if they hear that the
questioner who you trust is calling it
conspiracy theory they're not really
going to listen to the details of the
claim they're going to be oh it's a
story about how dumb Republican
conspiracy theories are got it got
it uh number two the mocking way the
question was asked it it was more like
but you think the election was
stolen which is way different from well
you've made some claims about the
election and others have said the
election's fine but we want to look into
your claims and and see what the basis
is for
them that's what a what that's what a
news report would do a news report
doesn't mock you for your conspiracy
theory if they can't tell if an election
was stolen or not so the other thing
they're trying to sell
you and they did try to sell this is
like but you you know the
courts you you fool you you piece of
 you you stupid you know the
courts didn't find anything wrong
the courts found nothing wrong you
 you stupid piece of now I'm
exaggerating they didn't say those words
but did say that the court was the basis
upon what is true now you all
know that's propaganda right the courts
are not the determin of whether an
election was fair it is true that if you
found something and you had standing and
you brought it to him in time there's
there's a very narrow little window of
things that maybe the courts could be
useful for but mostly they don't know
what true what did the court audit the
election no did the people bringing
stuff to the court audit the election no
they didn't have an option usually
no so the fact that 60 Minutes who
clearly knows better is selling to Their
audience that the only way you can know
if the election was stolen is if the
court said so no you
brainwashing pieces of no you don't
need the court to tell you if an
election was
stolen now I don't know what it would
take because we don't have access to
really know because it's not an
auditable process the way it is but
certainly anybody who tells you the
courts are the determinant of whether
the election was fair they are
bad people they're either
idiots and that's probably not what's
happening or they're just trying to
brainwash you because they know they're
stealing the election and they don't
want to get asked questions yeah the
whole every time the court gets brought
into it you're you're into brainwashing
propaganda it's not a conversation it's
no longer a conversation it's not
news it's just
propaganda as soon as the courts are
brought into it so remember that
rule so there's a report by bottle
Raiders I don't know who the bottle ERS
are but they're talking about the uh
purported drinking problem of kamla
Harris and they're they're talking about
how Saturday Night Live was mocking her
for you know portrayed her as having a
glass of wine in her hands and
suggesting that maybe she really liked
your alcohol and here's how this was
covered uh they talk about how
Newsweek talked about
um how this started they said Newsweek
reported that a trump Trump Ally James
Blair I think he has something to do
with the campaign may have originated
the claim on
X so somebody named James Blair is being
blamed for suggesting that K Harris has
a drinking problem and uh they they
think he suggested it or started it on
August
17th so let's do a little fact check
here so
Newsweek which as you know is a news
publication
allegedly um August
17th so that wasn't very long ago right
August
17th is uh August 17th the first time
you heard somebody on the xplatform
suggest that commers had a drinking
problem was it August 17th does anybody
remember
anything anything from anybody that
happened maybe before August 17th a
little bit earlier
anybody here's my
question was that
me did I do
this cuz I don't remember anybody saying
it before I did I don't have my dates
right but it was well before August I'm
sure yeah so remember I always tell you
about uh Gilman Amnesia so that's the
phenomenon where if you know the truth
of an event when you look at the news
you know the news got it wrong because
you knew what really happened in this
case do you see it so each of you
watched in person you watched me talk
about this hypothesis before anybody did
you know that a lot of people see
this and and you know that uh in the
past I've influenced
events and Newsweek is blaming somebody
who said it on August
17th now check the number of
followers that uh that James Blair has
and then compare it to the number of
followers I
have and in both cases they're primarily
probably political people following both
of
us now do you see the Gilman the galman
Amnesia every time you know the real
story you can tell that the news is
wrong every time here's one of those
examples yeah this is clearly wasn't
him let me tell you for sure it wasn't
him it didn't start there he might have
been a fast follower but no didn't start
there now but you all see it right you
you got to see the real event and then
you got to see the news get it wrong
that's Gilman and meesia once you
realize that that's every time then you
move to the next level of awareness if
you're still at the point of wow that
that's weird that you found that one
example
Scott
no we're not talking about one
example this is just the way it all
works all the news is fake about
anything important and by fake I mean
just some context is left out usually
speaking of fake uh Bob Woodward has a
book coming out next week and there's
some hints about what's in it and one of
one of them is so MSNBC and all the
propaganda networks are trying to make a
big deal out of the fact that uh
according to
Woodward
um that Trump had uh made available to
Putin during the pandemic some uh covid
tests because Russia was having trouble
getting them and uh Trump made them
available to Putin personally not not
for the country of Russia but just for
Putin's own
use now the uh the news is trying to
make that look like a bad thing when I
read that I
said what why is that a bad
thing well what am I
missing here's what I understand see if
compare this to what you understand the
job of a
president is to manage relationships
with all the dictators and allies and
everybody else so how well you manage
your relationship with the most
important allies and even adversaries is
the key to you doing a good
job now you could call that a sales
job it's a persuasion SL sales job
you're trying to sell yourself and the
country
to a variety of different world
leaders have you ever heard of the
salesman trick called
reciprocity the most basic persuasion
trick hey I'm going to give you
something that you couldn't easily get
yourself I'm not asking anything in
return that's it that's the trick that's
what salespeople do when I worked for
the phone company I'm sorry not the
phone company when I work for a big Bank
uh it was my job to pick
vendors you know which vendor would be
selected for you know big contracts they
were multi-million dollar deals and so
AT&T which was always one of the vendors
that was under
consideration uh would offer me tickets
to sports
events why were they offering me tickets
to sports events was it because it was
my
birthday no
is because they were creating
reciprocity they were giving me
something so that when I was deciding or
helping the the company decide which
vendor to choose that maybe just maybe
I'd be a little bit more biased to the
people who like to give me gifts now of
course I was a good employee so I just
reported it and didn't accept the gifts
so so my boss said nope you do not have
the
right no you're not going to accept
those tickets and I would say really I
can't accept those even if I promise not
to be biased no you're not going to
accept those tickets so I didn't
now so you see so you see Trump the the
salesman in Chief he tells you he's a
Salesman he says I'm trying to sell the
country and then you see him do the most
common most reliable salesman trick hey
how would you like some covid tests so
that the next time they have to talk
about something
important Putin is not going to have a
you know this giant hard-on bad feeling
about Trump he's going to have a little
bit of a you know what when I got in
trouble you gave me a little little hand
there now it's not going to completely
change the relationship between the two
countries but persuasion 101 is to make
the person you're pers persuading feel
good about you that's rule number one if
you start out with you're a face
I'm going to do everything I can to kill
you all right let's
negotiate that's what the Democrats do
we're going to try to put you in a
business kill you let's
negotiate what no you give him some
covid tests and then you
negotiate that's how it's done that's
how persuasion works it's what Trump
understands and of course the news can
count on the public not knowing how
anything works so they'll just say well
he must be Putin's puppet because he's
giving him stuff that he could have used
in America which is dumb so for the
price of a few covid tests the smallest
price you could ever
pay Trump bought some Goodwill that
probably remains to this day if this is
true by the way we don't know if it's
true all right what else did Woodward
have
um he says that uh well this is
weird uh apparently according to
Woodward Joe Biden thinks that Obama is
to blame for being too weak when Crimea
was taken over and that the reason that
Putin went into
Ukraine is Obama's
fault now hold on hold on so we're going
to have to figure out what this means so
Bob Woodward you would expect would be
totally in the tank for the Democrats
right but yet his book seems to be um
negative about
Obama which wouldn't make sense if
they're all part of the same deep State
Network which which you probably thought
they
were so why would Bob Woodward throw
Obama under the bus on something this
important this is not trivial it's a war
he's throwing Obama under the bus on a
war well here's my
take I think this is a better indication
of who's really running things you know
we like to say that Obama is the real
power behind the power and that Obama is
like puppet mastering the Democrat Party
but then how would you explain
this if Obama's the Puppet Master how
does Woodward who's you know deeply
connected to that whole part of the
world how does he print something that's
so obviously
anti-obama
well here's a
possibility here's a solid rule the
people who are really in charge only
care that were tough on Russia this
seems to be the only through thread the
one thing that connects
everything the one thing that connects
everything is that we have to be you
know hard on
Russia so it could be that the Deep
State you know the military industrial
complex is not exactly on board with
Obama and maybe never has been so it
could be that in truth Obama is you know
manipulating the puppet strings of the
Democrats but that there's a power
higher and that the military industrial
complex is above Obama in their
influence when it comes to war at least
so it looks
like the Woodward take is to make sure
that anybody who allows Putin to do
anything including in the past Crimea
anybody who does that is a bad person
and that you know pushing on Putin is
the only thing that works so so there
are two Putin related stories in
Woodward's book one to make uh one to
make Trump look bad for trying to work
with Putin
and one making uh Obama look bad for
caving into
him that tells me that whoever is really
in
charge if you assume that Woodward is
connected to you know any deep forces in
the government it would be that there's
somebody who's a higher rank than Obama
and Trump and
Biden at least when it comes to
war and we do suspect that might might
be the case so I think the the most
accurate way to look at who's really in
charge behind the curtain is more than
one person and that they have areas of
Interest where when it comes to the war
stuff it's maybe names we don't even
know
anyway um I wouldn't trust anything that
comes out in a Woodward book or any
political book that involves what
somebody said behind closed doors this
getting back to my earlier comment um I
don't think there's any
credibility about a political book
saying that something was said behind
closed doors so this one also is low
credibility all
right uh as you know Kell Harris is on
her media
blitz and uh she had been sort of doing
the hiding from the Press thing for most
of the summer but now apparently the the
campaign has decided they better Str is
to send them out send her out to the
friendliest interviewers you could
possibly send her to so avoiding the
hard news by sending her to the
friendliest people
possible
now here's what that
means imagine being the the K Harris
campaign and you narrow down your two
best strategies to
these these are your two top strategies
number one hide her so the public can
ever hear her and that that strategy
hide her so that the people can't know
who they're voting for was at least
almost equal to the second choice
strategy which which is actually the
first choice because they did it and the
First Choice was to send Dr to talk to
people who would absolutely be in the
bag for the Democrats and would try to
make her look
good now both of those choices
are
pathetic they're pathe
patic imagine that being your only two
choices imagine if Trump the only
choices he had were well he's going to
hide he's going to hide or he's only
going to talk to
Hannity and nothing
else would you support
that you wouldn't even support the
Republican under those situations would
you would you even support your own team
if they said I'm only going to let him
talk to Hannity but nothing else just
Hannity of course not of course not the
the fact that that they're campaign
their two best choices were to
completely abandon political campaigning
one hide and the other only talk to
Friendly people who are going to be on
your side the only
choices the only
ones that's as pathetic as you can get
so what happens when one candidate has a
track record of success as president a
number of policies that are far more
popular with the public than the the
other one and one of them is hiding
Andor only talking to people who won't
make her look too
embarrassed it's a
tie according to the pollsters it's a
tie how is that even impossible now keep
in mind that the people living in the
other movie where Trump is Hitler if
you're living in the other movie you're
saying the same thing but in Reverse how
in the world is anybody voting for Trump
I mean I watched The Daily Show I
watched Bill Maher and then I watched uh
Howard Stern and I just don't understand
how anybody could vote for that guy so
that's the other
movie but so far she has turned every
single uh outing that wasn't scripted
into a disaster so it's a whole week of
total disasters and the Trump campaign
is using her public appearances without
editing as their campaign
ads
ouch ouch now you might say but that's
what they do with Trump they they show
things out a
context except it's not the context in
this case with Trump they actually have
to change the context or clip something
out so it looks worse than it
is my digital device just weighed um so
with Trump you have to take him out of
context and imagine that he's using
words in a way that people don't use
words to turn it into something bad with
Harris you just have to show the actual
interview in fact in fact the Trump
campaign is doing the opposite of
clipping it the the CBS interview
allegedly uh edited Harris's answer so
that it didn't look like word salid
stupidity apparently we have access to
at least the the real one and then the
fake one now somebody said that they
switched their answer from one question
into the other one so it didn't look so
stupid I'm not 100% sure that the claim
they edited it is what the rep uans are
saying because I don't want to fall for
a hoax because this this definitely
could be a hoax so since I haven't seen
the original I've only seen the claim
that it was edited I don't buy into it
yet totally possible but um and if if
some of you have seen any confirmation
from CBS that they edited it let me know
but if CBS doesn't confirm it and they
don't give you the full video I don't
know what would convinced me it really
happened I'd have to see a little bit
more but uh people on the right say it
did happen
and um let's just go down the list here
in my opinion she's done the worst
performance of any public figure doing
interviews now I saw somebody in the
news say some people are saying it's the
worst of anybody
ever I think that's important to say if
you just say she didn't do a good job
were laughing at this answer yeah I
think you're missing the bigger picture
the bigger picture is nobody
ever ever who ran for president was this
bad I mean that's that's completely
different this is not like business as
usual we have a let me just say it
she's clearly a
 when it comes to at least talking
in public I maybe she can do a standard
test pretty well I don't know but she's
a in public there's just no other
way to say it all right so here's what
she's been up to
uh she want on Howard Stern I don't know
about you but when I see Howard Stern
talking to anybody I spend the entire
time looking at his bad
hairpiece I assume it's a hairpiece that
couldn't possibly be his real hair right
at his current
age okay does anybody have a
confirmation he's he's wearing a
hairpiece
right I I mean I I hope I'm not making
up a rumor but isn't it obvious it's
obvious right so I can't get past it
because it's not that he has a hairpiece
or I think he does again I'm not 100%
sure but looks like it to me it it's
that why would you have a hairpiece of
the worst hair person could have it
would be like Einstein getting a
hairpiece that looked like his regular
hair
why would you do that so the whole time
he's talking I can't even listen to what
he's saying because I I I don't think he
has any useful political ideas uh I
think he is just clearly in the bag for
one side so nothing he says is should
have any importance but uh it was cringy
and it's a weird choice for uh somebody
who's running against Trump to have a
friendly interview with a guy who has
done way worse when it comes to race and
misogyny now I will support Howard
Stern in saying that all of those things
were in the context of humor and when
Trump says something that's not totally
serious or in the context of humor I I
give him the same pass it's like it's a
joke people he's talking about you know
McCain being uh he liked people who
don't get caught don't take that
seriously that's a joke so I don't take
Howard Stern
seriously uh but it's really cringey
that he would be the most misogynistic
person in the public domain and that
Harris who's got all these women
supporters would go to see him now my
question is this is that going to get
her any votes being on Howard Stern how
would that get you any
votes because it's mostly men who watch
it right do you think the men who were
watching Howard Stern are going to be oh
that was a good performance I don't know
I think that was probably a mistake
Harris also went on The
View and they they gave her the softball
question of all softballs like what
would she do different from Biden and if
she would do something different from
Biden why isn't she trying to do it now
now I'm going to give you some
uncharacteristic uh support for Harris
in this
case she's in a bad position because
she's the vice president and she's
running for office has that ever
happened
before
yeah yeah I guess that's happened
before but
um here's the problem we don't expect a
vice president to disagree with a
sitting president nor would I want her
to if if she's being paid to be a vice
president I don't want her going in
public and saying that that my boss is
getting this wrong do you like even if
even if she believed
it no I no she's being paid to agree
with her boss the go you know the
country is paying her and very
specifically we're paying you to agree
with your boss so if you put her in
public and ask her hey where where would
you disagree with your boss and then she
gives you a word salid answer I'm okay
with that I'm okay with it
yeah just change the subject word salad
me give me some lie to me no
your job is to agree with your boss and
I don't want any foreign leaders to see
Biden having two opinions coming out of
his office I don't want that even if I
disagree with his opinion I don't want
two opinions coming out of his office
that looks makes us look like idiots no
she should say here the best answer she
should give and she's given terrible
answers I mean it's a tough question but
her answers have been terrible here's
what I would like to do I think she
should
say uh you know I'm sitting vice
president I'm running for president but
as vice president my job what you're
paying me for is to be on board with the
Biden policies and am there are some
there are some things where my focus
might be a little different and there
are some things that have just changed
over time so we can see that maybe what
we did before wasn't working well enough
it's time to Pivot so mostly what I
would do would be to look to upgrade
Things based on how it's gone so far and
then there are a few few programs that I
like such as you know then mentioned the
$5,000 thing the $6,000 thing and say uh
you know that the time to recommend them
is during a campaign so I'm recommending
them during the campaign but I hope you
all understand that I'm being paid to
agree with my boss and that's what
you're paying me for so I'm not going to
leave that domain too much but if you
want to get a flavor for what I would do
uh these proposals are are different and
uh I probably have a let's say a greater
interest in this or that so there's
probably a way you could finesse it but
you'd have to be in the
top
2% of good of good communicators she's
not
so as much as I have sympathy for the
fact that the question is a little
unfair it's important and unfair at the
same time it's the right question I
would definitely ask the question but
it's unfair it's a little bit like you
know do you still beat your spouse
there's just no way to handle that
question so watching her handle a
question that can't be handled is
interesting could uh could Trump have
answered that
question just imagine that Trump were in
the same same position of course he
could he'd probably tell you exactly
what you're thinking oh I'm vice
president so I've got to agree with that
guy but when you set me free I've got
some interests that are a little bit
different let me tell you about him he
could do it so it's doable but you'd
have to be in the top 2% of
communicators
anyway uh then she went on Cole bear and
had a beer which was the dumbest thing
they could ever do because there are
rumors of her having a drinking problem
and uh she responded to him with a bunch
of word salad that will probably turn
into a campaign ad she did act like a
blithering idiot she acted like a
blithering
idiot
um and uh let's see so all of her I
would say all of her uh campaign stops
so far the ones that are in the media
have been total
disasters
um and and there disasters that I think
are the kind that even Democrats can see
but I'm not
sure you know I'm sure that there are
lots of interviews that Trump has given
over the years where you could say oh
that was bad for him that was a disaster
but none like this usually it's just
Trump said something provocative that
could be taken out of context so it
looks bad for him but it's not full out
incompetence what you're seeing is
somebody proving she doesn't have the
goods to be president every day usually
you don't get that from a campaign
usually both candidates run a pretty
good campaign maybe one's a little
better but when you're done you say oh
those are two people who ran you know
full National campaigns that's not
nothing but no she's not succeeding even
a little bit the the machine is pushing
her but she's not made she hasn't done
anything worthy not not a single good
day and and the funniest is when she
tries to avoid questions by going into
an inspirational speech have you seen
that
yet uh K Harris I'd like to ask you this
question uh you've proposed some new
programs how do you think you'll pay for
them Americans are ambitious and they
have goals and and and and they're
looking forward and we're going
forward and you just say oh my God
what's wrong with you what is wrong with
you so that's what makes me the f I
laugh the most because she can't sell
the serious stuff at all you could
easily imagine uh a trump and
Obama uh Bill
Clinton they could sell all that stuff
about you know hope and change and
moving forward and making America great
they could sell that you know RFK Jr he
could sell it but but wow she can't sell
that at all it just looks like she was
trying to memorize a speech in sixth
grade um and then and then we'd move
forward and then we'd come together uh
then the then the country would work
together and then when she thinks she's
got a good sentence she'll look at you
like she's so proud like she nailed it
it's like and then we'll work
together like she's waiting for you to
be all happy because she said something
something that everybody thinks is a
good idea working
together anyway Christopher Ray head of
the FBI was asked again by Congress if
there were confidential informants on
January
6 and uh he said well I have to be very
careful about that which means
yes um without saying yes and because
obviously if the answer was no what
would the answer be if the answer was no
the answer would be
no you wouldn't say I can't tell
you there's no world in which I can't
tell you is the right answer if the
answer was no there were no no
informants as given that it's you know a
normal thing to do um also we can rule
out that there were only a
few I'm going to rule out the option
that there were only a few do you know
why
because if Ry had said um it's standard
procedure to embed some resources in an
event like this uh we had a few
resources they were there to watch they
did not participate in anything you know
that would make it
worse now if that were
true would it be a problem if he said
so if I said there there were a few I
don't want to give you the exact number
but we had a few and they were just
there to observe and that's all they
did why wouldn't he say that because if
he said that I would say to myself Oh
you mean the FBI was doing its
job it it wouldn't matter who the group
was or why they're protesting I would
think if it's a political thing
especially around the capital I would
think the FBI should have some
informants in the group and I think
there should be several you know one or
two would be not enough I think there be
at least a handful so if he said yeah we
had we had several I don't want to give
you the
number um and there were there just
there to observe and collect information
I would have said oh good job there
Christopher Ray thanks thanks for
telling us and it sounds like you were
on top of
it it can't be that
then if it would be so easy to say the
truth if you did a good job and it was
just a few informants and its normal
procedure
there's something they're hiding so what
I see is that there were a lot of them
and that they were more active than they
should have been that's what I say so to
me this looks like a confession of
extreme
guilt what would you say now I'm biased
of course but it no matter what the
topic is if somebody's answering in this
indirect way when you know that an
honest answer would be simple and clean
it would be no risk whatsoever
what am I supposed to
think the the obvious conclusion is that
there were a lot of them and they were
up to no good obviously now remember
what I always tell you if you're talking
about a citizen citizens are innocent to
proven guilty yeah you government you
better have the goods or don't go after
a citizen but it's opposite when the
government is involved in this case the
FBI if the government's being Ki
then you should assume guilt which is
what I do I assume guilt not only do I
assume that they had more than a few
people there but that they were
explicitly involved
in illegal or bad
behavior I'm going to take that as a
confession likewise when the F folks in
is it fton
County when they refuse to unlock the
door that some people say have some fake
ballots behind them that were used in
2020 I don't need them to open the
door no the refusal to open the door is
a confession that there there's a room
full of fake ballots or there used to be
and they removed them and burned
them but I definitely don't think that
there's nothing behind the door if you
refuse to open the door and you're a
citizen I'm going to say well that looks
sketchy but you're a citizen and you
have the right of privacy so if we don't
know there's a crime behind that door
and you don't want to show us behind
that
door innocent will proven guilty but not
the government if the government doesn't
open it you're guilty and that
is the working assumption that you
should all have government you don't
have the right to keep something like
that from the people now the government
does have a right to keep some Secrets
if it was some big military secret yeah
sure keep the military Secret that's
fine but not this we need to know who
won the election I think we have a right
to
that
anyway um Israel uh is apparently still
prepping for some kind of an Iran
response we know that America the
American government want or at least
Biden doesn't want them to go too hard
and doesn't want them to go so hard on
Iran that Iran will respond in some kind
of a aggressive way
um
and maybe that's going to start
today um I think it made sense that they
didn't do something on October 7th they
probably thought about it but it's
better to keep October 7th remember for
what it was you don't want to muck it up
with a gigantic response because then
they can say well now it's our October
7th it's not your October 7th it's ours
now so it's probably good that they
waited but they're not going to wait
long and if you look at the options the
options would either be uh a
decapitation
strike which would be pretty risky a
strike on their nuclear
facilities which I'm hearing the Biden
campaign doesn't want them to do
that I don't know why so I'd like to
hear the argument I suspect the Biden
campaign or the Biden Administration uh
I expect the administration know more
about the Iranian nuclear program maybe
they think that they're going to do a
breakout in two weeks if you don't kill
it all I don't know maybe they think
there's another way to take it down so
they don't want to do it you don't want
to waste some bombs so we don't know
what's really going on in terms of the
targeting uh we're just going to know
what the outcome is if I had to guess
the US is is trying to convince them to
bomb some you know meaningless military
targets just just to say they hit them
back um I don't think that Israel is
going to take on the oil
refineries because that would change the
politics in the United States really
quickly so if you want if you're Israel
and you want um support from the
American citizens you don't want to
increase the price of our
gas so I'm pretty sure Netanyahu
understands that lesson of persuasion if
there's one thing you can't
do do not increase the cost of our gas
at the moment especially there might
have been a time you know when when gas
was cheap and everybody could pay their
rent you know maybe you could take a
risk on that but
today if if Israel bombs something and
the News tells you that it made your gas
go up 10 cents you're going to be
pissed and that would be a disaster for
Israel so think that the oil refineries
are probably
safe um I wouldn't be
surprised has Israel gone after the
hoodies
yet probably have we just don't know
about it but maybe maybe Israel will
just wipe out the hoodies instead of
hitting Iran's Homeland something like
that I wouldn't rule that out it might
be the hoodies are going to have a bad
week we'll see we we'll see and that
would make us happier I think because
the hoodies are making our cost go up
with
their their uh putting a risk on the
shipping all right ladies and gentlemen
that's all I got for you today went way
too long again and um I'm going to talk
to the locals people privately because
they're
awesome all right um and I'll see the
rest of you next uh well tomorrow I
guess so if you're on X or YouTube
