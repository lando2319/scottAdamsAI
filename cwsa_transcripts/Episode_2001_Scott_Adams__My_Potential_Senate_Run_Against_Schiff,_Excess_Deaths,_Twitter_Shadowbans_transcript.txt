after that
good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization and probably your entire
life I know I know the birth of your
children the day you got married that
stuff's cool too but this
is the highlight of your life if you
want to take it up a notch
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
a tanker jealous of Stein a canteen
Joker flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine ahead of the
day the thing that makes everything
better
yes Kevin and the Fed
go
Ah that's good
we have so many stories here today
I don't know where to begin
so I'll begin with the funny ones
um I've told you before that parody in
reality have merged
then nobody can tell the difference
between a parody and the actual news
well there's something else that that
merged
and you've noticed it I know you've
noticed it
the idea of some and all
they've merged
so for example if I say you know
some Democrats
committed crimes you're you're from that
point on you can say all all Democrats
are criminals
if you say
there are some people who were on that
January 6 group that were some bad
characters well then you can say they
all were they all were because some are
that's our new our new conflation
if there's some of a group to do
anything it's all of them
now that used to make no sense at all
but once we merged parody and reality
well we realized we could merge anything
so some things
and all things are the same also we also
merged
the idea of being against pandemic
restrictions
with the idea of being completely for
them
now there's no distinction
I didn't think that would ever happen
but keep an eye on all those completions
let's talk about Paul Pelosi I saw a
video that hadn't seen before of him
being arrested for his DUI back in the
spring of last year
and
he was really really drunk
I I kind of in my mind I was imagining
somebody who had a little bit of trouble
you know walking you a straight line and
that would be way too drunk to drive
but he was so drunk
that he couldn't really respond in
coherent way
so uh that looks like alcoholic drunk
doesn't it
yeah he doesn't look like a tourist like
he looked he like he looks like he liked
to get the real drunk you know not the I
had three drinks at dinner and I didn't
realize I had one too many didn't look
like that
did not look like that it looked like he
had some experience but that's just
totally subjective
however now it turns out that a judge is
going to release the body cam video
of his uh attack by hammer
in his home by depape
so it looks like we'll get to see that I
think Jesse Waters Senate producer to go
get a copy so he might have that tonight
um but here's my simulation question why
is it that the two stories about Paul
Pelosi both involve him getting hammered
is that a coincidence
there's only two things he's in the news
for and they both involve getting
hammered
I don't know
there's nothing funny about violence
there's nothing funny about violence
unless there's a pun involved
then go ahead
um
yesterday I watched
somehow somehow this story had escaped
me because I don't pay too too much
attention to sports and because I don't
pay attention to sports
and I don't pay attention to you know
anecdotal stories of somebody who had
you know a problem that we're trying to
generalize to all people
I usually ignore those but the Demar
Hamlin story I had never seen the
compilation video of him allegedly
visiting the football game
[Laughter]
and let me tell you when you look at the
video you know the all of the angles and
you can never see his face
and the other seems like he's perfectly
healthy but doesn't want to be you know
you still hospitalized but seem
perfectly healthy in that video
now I found the videos of Demar Hamlin
to be
at least as convincing
at least as convincing as the fact that
Epstein strangled himself to death in
his own his own self
I would put those things on roughly the
same level of believability
now I can't know for sure
can't know for sure what was happening
but if you watch the videos you would
have a hard time believing that's really
him
it's impossible to believe that's really
him
but the fact that they even attempted
that it looks like right don't know for
sure
don't know for sure but it certainly
looked like they pulled a fast one and I
think they kind of got away with it
which is kind of amazing so I guess the
part of the story that impresses me is
that it very
very close to almost totally working but
it still worked
it still worked
uh assuming allegedly that's not him I
think there's a very small small chance
that was really him
very small Jets
so that's the state of our news that
that look real
all right the funniest the funniest
thing is I love the Republicans when
they name bills because they make the
bills insulting to somebody
completely unnecessary but it's funny so
I approve of it so representative Matt
Gates
he introduced the pencil act
that that would bar Adam Schiff
specifically from accessing any
classified information
what would you call a piece of
legislation
that was specifically meant to Bar just
one person
Adam Schiff from accessing accessing
classified information well if you were
very funny you might call it the
preventing extreme negligence with
classified information licenses
or the pencil resolution
now if you not connecting the dots yet
you know that President Trump referred
to Adam Schiff as Pencil Neck
so the name of the bill that's
preventing him seeing the wood prevent
him from seeing classified information
is called the pencil resolution
I think I think it was a good idea until
they got licenses at the end so the L
and pencils as licenses
I think they should have said
legislation
right isn't it legislation I would have
gone with preventing extreme negligence
with classified information
legislation but licenses Chanel at least
all right uh did any of you see what uh
Trump said about John Bolton today
he's back
you just have to hear this I'm going to
read it to you so John Bolton thinks
that Trump is poisoned to the Republican
party so he said that recently uh Trump
being no shrinking violet decided to
respond to that in some detail
and see if this sounds do you think that
Trump is lying about this
or exaggerating or is it right on the
money right that's what decision you'll
make lying exaggerating or right on the
mark
so Trump tweeted or not tweeted but he
truth today I found John Bolton to be
one of the dumbest people in government
but I am proud to say I used him well a
total and unhinged warmonger in caps the
red-faced boiler ready to explode was
one of those very stupid voices that got
us into the Middle East quicksand seven
trillion dollars and millions of deaths
later nothing
the good news is that I won big
negotiations with this by my side
when I brought him into a room with
hostile foreign leaders they thought I
was going to war
conceded all
now does anybody remember what I said
when Trump brought John Bolton into the
administration does anybody remember how
I characterized that when he first
brought him in and people were saying
what
John Bolton is the opposite of you why
would you add why would you add a
warmonger
and you know I wasn't the only one who
said it but I said it looks like he's
just going to use him as a useful idiot
to scare the out of the people he's
negotiating with
well
well that's what he did
the best part of the story is that he
says it directly
like he says it directly yep he was a
 and a warmonger so I brought him
into the meetings to scare the out
of the people so they would agree with
my reasonable my reasonable plans
well played
well played Mr President well played
all right how many of you have seen the
project Veritas uh
hidden video with the uh the guy who
works for Pfizer who was saying that
there were considering some kind of
guided Evolution which some people would
say gate would be gain a function uh so
that they could test their vaccines
against
variants
but how many of you saw the follow-up
which I had not seen until this morning
where there was the reveal
where the project Veritas why am I
forgetting his name uh
they had a project yeah James O'Keefe so
James O'Keefe reveals himself
well the guy on hidden video is still at
the date
so I think probably the guy he thought
he was on a date with was a hidden plant
probably excused himself to go to the
restroom or something so James O'Keefe
walks in you know just like uh To Catch
a Predator
except this type is to catch a guy
saying things he shouldn't have said
so you have to see it if there's
anything that will make you laugh in the
worst possible way you'll feel bad about
yourself
let me warn you you won't feel good
about yourself because it'll say a
little bit too much about you and said
too much about me but man it was funny
and so it turns into a scuffle I mean
they're they're basically their people
end up on the floor he goes crazy
because the whole time he suspected it
was a hidden camera trick like when he
was on the date he kept saying you're
not recording me right because they do
that and he was the whole time he was
being recorded so his his defense
the Pfizer employee was that he was
lying on a date he goes I was just on a
date I was just lying on a date that's
all I was doing I was lying on a date
now
I think the more correct defense would
have been it was just something talked
about in a meeting you know I didn't
think it was going to happen
I mean that would have been a better
defense but oh my God you have to see it
it's like just the the golden piece of
content but
um
before he has comment on this was from
Super chill at Twitter user who
commented about this video he goes very
few dates end up with charges of crimes
against humanity and I thought to myself
you know you always hear these stories
about the worst date
like what's the worst date you've ever
had
this is the winner
I don't care how bad is the worst day
you've ever been on
this day ended with this fellow being
maybe accessory to crimes against
humanity
foreign
I've had bad days in my life but not a
single time did they end up in a scuffle
which put me to the floor
and ended up in videotape Across the
Nation uh charging me of being
associated with
crimes against humanity that's that's a
bad day bad date
all right here's the story that's more
of like a sign of the times the
Milwaukee Bucks uh I guess they had a
drag show
as part of their pride night festivities
during halftime of their game
now
as you know
as you know I'm very pro-trans pro-lgbtq
but there is a point where you have to
ask
should their message be
simply you know widely understood and
appreciated
I'd like that should we all be more
open-minded of course of course
but do we need to insert their message
everywhere
everywhere I and I'm just going to ask
that simple question
yes yes I believe their their message is
important and I think everybody is
different and we should respect each of
our differences
but do we have to insert it everywhere
does it have to be everywhere
for example the other day I stopped at
the gas station and I filled up my tank
do you know what was missing
sort of more of a pride trans kind of
experience I just went in there and I
got a whole bunch of heterosexual gas
put in my car and left learned nothing I
learned nothing from that experience I
needed more of a
trans communication of their
their feelings I like more about that
everywhere I go I want that everywhere
every experience needs to have a little
bit more of that because we like it so
much
all right something very interesting is
brewing in the energy
uh let's say the energy Mysteries of the
world here is a mystery that I've been
trying to get to the bottom of forever
and maybe I have or I'm close to it it
goes like this
Elon Musk has said a number of times
that America could be powered by
um solar power
if they were attached to batteries so
that you know they worked at night and
when it's cloudy as long as you had
enough of them and that it is totally
practical
to get to the point where we're powering
the country with a whole bunch of solar
Powers solar arrays now other people
especially the not as green people say
my God that is not even close to
possible you're off by a factor of 30.
Alex Epstein who's been writing quite a
bit about climate and energy
um
is sort of public no sort of he's
publicly challenging
Elon musk's math
now just take just take a pause
to realize how much balls you need to
have
to go on Twitter of all places on
Twitter
and to challenge Elon musk's math
on solar power
well he did it he did it and I love this
I love this because it actually isn't
clear
you know it we have the same problem of
whether we're qualified to look at any
of their numbers but you know Alex
Epstein makes his argument and he shows
his work
he shows his work
right so you can just look at Alex
Epstein's argument
and it's just math
and then you can look at
um musk's claim
and then it's just math
I'm going to give you a prediction of
why they differ because they differ by a
factor of 10 or 30 or something so
they're not even in the same zip code
one says wildly impractical economically
the other says perfectly practical no
you know no problem you know the math
works perfectly they can't both be right
here's my guess
and I don't know this is true but I
suspect that musk is making assumptions
about
declining prices
and that maybe Alex Epstein is making
less less of a claim about declining
prices but what would happen if for
example
the country said all right we're going
to try to make everything solar powered
and we're taking bids
from companies that will be in this
space
we're gonna it'll probably take us 20
years to build out all this capacity
so if you get the bid you've got a
20-year contract
imagine how much that would be worth
that would be like a trillion dollar
contract
now of course they would not give it to
one vendor because that would be crazy
they'd give it to multiple vendors and
they'd have them compete
I think if you did a project that big
the initial prices would immediately
drop below cost
right so I think Alex Epstein is making
a reasonable assumption
that people would sell these products
for a profit because that's how the
world works but on this really rare
situation
which would happen once in history
where somebody would say we're going to
spend a trillion dollars to convert
everything to Electric
the vendors who were the smartest and
the richest
would say my first offer is I'll provide
it to you at one quarter of my cost
one quarter of my cost today I'm not
going to wait I will give it to you
today for one quarter of my current
costs
because that would be the smart offer
because they know that almost
immediately if if the volume was a
trillion dollar order
almost immediately competition would go
through the roof you know new companies
would spin up to sell their own solar
panels new Innovations would pop up
because now it really matters if you can
make a better battery
you know how almost immediately the
battery companies would be fully funded
every every alternative battery company
would be fully funded immediately the
the day the government said we're going
to spend a trillion dollars Boom the
whole industry would just catch on fire
so I don't know if this is the case
but if musk is assuming that the
economics would wildly change the moment
we decided to do something that big I
think he's right
I think he's right
but we don't know how much and we don't
know quickly
so I think that this is a calculation
that nobody could make
because the biggest part of the
calculation is what happens you know in
three to five years when the market
tries to adjust to this wildly gigantic
thing
who knows it could be an innovation that
changes everything
so I don't think you can be calculated
but I love the fact that Alex Epstein is
challenging the math
and he's doing it right in public
right now I don't know if uh musk will
respond
but you know I tweeted it so he's got a
chance to see it anyway
I'd love to know his response to that
because I here's here's what I think
his response is not going to be bad
like it won't be oops
I did the math wrong like that's not
going to happen it's going to be you
know more color on top of what what he
already said so I think I think that
would be really interesting
all right as you know Adam Schiff is
running for Senate in California
and I uh did a Twitter poll
to ask people how I would do against him
now this wasn't whether they would vote
for me right because my audience is you
know conservative leaning so if I ask
them if they'd vote for me that would be
unfair I just said who would win
which is not necessarily that they would
vote for me but just who do you think
would win
and the this unscientific Twitter poll
of 56 thought I would win
now there were some who you know were
uncertain but I I want to test you how
many do you think um
what percentage do you think
thought shift would win
wow did you see it or are you just
guessing right
I feel like you're all guessing right
yeah 23 but just very close to your your
guesses are so good wow do you guess
well
so impressive
yeah
so uh people think I'd get at least a
double double his vote
uh and then a strange thing happened uh
Elon Musk noteds the poll
and tweeted at me
please run that would be awesome
do you know how many
likes and Views and retweets you get
when Elon Musk
comments on your Tweet it's just crazy
yeah one the other day has over 5
million views I've never had 5 billion
views on anything
but as soon as he comments it goes goes
to the roof
um
so this made me think that I should
start working on my uh clever
slogans don't you think I need I need to
work on my clever slogans because
um I would be him with memes alone
um now I was informed this morning that
Adam Schiff
married a woman named Eve
were you aware that they are Adam and
Eve
were you aware of that
that that's the real thing that's
happening
they're actually
Adam and Eve
and here's the funny part
I swear this is true yesterday when I
was thinking of my funny memes
I I Googled snakes
because without even knowing that they
were Adam and Eve
when I look at
when I look at Schiff he looks like a
snake
like everybody looks like an animal to
me
but it looks like a snake like a snake
head but then I looked at actual
snakeheads and I couldn't find any that
looked like him and I thought oh that's
that's just you know my bias
so he doesn't look like a snake at all I
want to clarify he does not look like a
snake
um
you might ask is there anything but is
there anything he does look like and I
was doing a little Googling and I did
find something he does look like
uh which is a cat's sphincter
so I'll blow it up a little bit
now it might be a little hard to see but
this is the cat's ass
and it looks exactly like Adam Schiff
talking about Russian collusion
is that just me
yeah so you know you've heard that Jesus
will sometimes appear on like a grilled
cheese sandwich or somebody will see
Jesus is facing a like a tree
or something but that's not the only
place the faces appear so this is you
know Adam Schiff in a cat's ass
so
I don't think he's going to get as many
people worshiping it
but we'll see
all right so here are some of the
some of the slogans that I've been uh
you know thinking about so I want to get
your feedback please can you give me
some feedback of which these slogans you
find the catchiest
all right my first was uh that the the
setup would be a chef who's not that
bright
against me and I like to thank you on a
good day I'm kind of bright so I thought
a good framing this would be shift
or
brains
that's that's your decision chef
uh or brains
and
this is only so that I could get the
people on TV to say
his slogan is Schiffer brains
Schiffer brains
okay that's your first one hold that
hold that one
here's the next one
I'm going to put shift where he belongs
on the side on the San Francisco
sidewalk with with the rest of it
the shift doesn't belong in in the
Senate it belongs on the sidewalk of San
Francisco with all the rest of it
too long okay too long
um
I have a lot of dilber fans
what will happen when Schiff hits the
fans
no no that's a little
that's a little too on the nose yeah
okay we won't do that one how about uh
vote for the one who looks the least
like a cat's sphincter
now I wrote it that way because
I think I look a little bit like a cat's
sphincter too
but it's a matter of degree right I'm
like on a scale of one to ten I'm like a
maybe a six
you know in terms of my similarity to a
cat's sphincter
but I think that Chef is at least a nine
so that's a big difference I think I
could capitalize on that the difference
in who looks more like a cat's sphincter
now here's one I think has a lot of
potential
the jokester versus the hoaxster
the jokester versus the hoaxster what do
you think
what do you think uh yeah that could
work that could fly
all right how about uh
yeah I think I think those are the good
ones okay
now here's a question
uh if I ran could I say that I'm going
to work from home and only telecommute
is that an option
and and if it's not why not
it's not an option
don't don't they still have their remote
voting thing
I thought Cove had brought them the
remote voting thing so that
I I think they should keep that remote
voting and I should work from home
and but the real question is what I run
as a Democrat or a Republican
ah what do you think
if Iran is a Democrat
would I get to debate him quicker
because if I want as a Democrat I might
be in a runoff against a Republican
and then I could just throw the race
and let the Republican win
I didn't see that coming did you but I
could just run as a Republican and just
you know beat him fair and square
um
I think that I would limit my cam so
here here's the proposition that would
make
I make the following proposition
to the Democrats in California now first
of all you know that California is super
blue
and yet
they did elect Reagan and they did elect
Arnold Schwarzenegger
Republicans
now what do they have in common
well Reagan was before the demographic
shift but they're both funny
right the people who ran as Republicans
who were the funniest
got elected
I have a theory that the only thing that
Californians want is entertainment
you you think that's not true
but look how often it seems to be true
you tell me
that I wouldn't get elected simply by
being the most entertaining person in
politics
that would work
yeah that would totally work I would
just have to be the most entertaining I
would have to be entertaining enough
that the California media could not
ignore me
do you think I could pull that off
do you do you think I could be
provocative enough that the media just
couldn't ignore me it would just be
impossible
yeah what would it take for me to take a
lead in that race immediately
let me tell you what it would take
a genuine National poll
that that includes me in the list
because I'm not positive but I might
beat him in a legitimate poll too
I don't know because I have more I have
more name recognition
I think
don't I I want to check that uh to do a
Google fight but I don't know if that
site still works it just kept
kept churning but didn't give me
anything but I'd love to know if if you
do a actually somebody do that right now
do a Google test to find out who has
more name recognition
Adam Schiff or me
because I think it's me
just because people don't follow
politics that much really
but I don't know it could be a I don't
know
so that's the question
I would also limit I promise to limit my
campaign donations to only individual
donors
and the maximum donation I would take
from any individual no corporations no
lobbyists no packs just individuals sort
of like Bernie but I would limit my
maximum donation to 420 dollars
I mean you got to pick a number yeah
how did you know that before I said it
Don you you're front running my jokes
here Don
all right we have a psychic this is
ruining everything some psychic actually
got my punchline before I said it now
that was pretty random so
so apparently psychics are real
here's the other thing I promise
if elected I will Steel Man the
arguments that I don't agree with
have you ever seen anybody do that
nope
Obama did a little bit like he would you
would give some a little bit of
attention to the other side
but no politician has ever done this
I'll tell you what I promise you
I'll present the strongest argument on
your side before I make any decisions
and I'll even let you look at it and
decide whether I succeeded if that's not
the strongest argument well then I'll
redo it
when you're satisfied I've showed I've
shown the the public the strongest
argument that disagrees with me
even if somebody else writes it I'll
make sure it gets just as much attention
as what I want to do but then I'll make
the decision
but I'll make sure you've seen the
strongest argument against my position
foreign
that I won't vote in lockstep with
Republicans
now that would be dangerous because then
the Republicans might say oh we kind of
like somebody who voted in lockstep
they'll say I might
but I'll promise you I'll look at
everything individually
um
and then
here's also what I would do once I got
to the debate because I think I'd
probably make it into the last two with
kind of a jungle runoff situation
um
the first thing I do is just before the
debate
or maybe the first thing I said as the
debate started I would change my
pronouns
now the reason I do this
is just to give myself a little bit of
an advantage in the debate
because because here's how I want to
play it because I can imagine you know
ladies and gentlemen I just I would like
to announce if you would I'd like to
announce that my pronouns are uh our
senator
she and her
Senator she and her
and then everybody would be like well
you're joking right and I would say
excuse me
what did you say
and they say
um you're joking
and I would look at them and say my God
my God
this is getting off to a bad start
I I thought I was going to be here with
good people
I'm horrified I'm horrified
and then when the debate starts I think
I could count on shift slipping a little
bit
and he might say something like this
my opponent he has never been in
government and I say oh ho ho ho what
did you just say
he
he
and then I just go full Karen on him
full Karen I just melt down
how dare you how dare you
and that would be my whole debate
because nobody cares about the issues
really
so that'd be pretty much my debate
um I noticed yesterday that it appears
that Democrats are taking me seriously
enough that it appears they've activated
the hit squad against me
so
you you probably noticed that when uh
Trump was running the first time
that the hit pieces against me come out
because I was being a little bit too
effective and so the Democrats you know
sent some people to take me down if you
were to search for me
during the first election the first I
think the tops the top you know third
party site that wasn't something for me
was Bloomberg's hippies
do you think that was natural
do you think it's natural that the top
search for the entire campaign
the top search for the entire campaign
was the hit piece against me
that's that's the one that was the
important one
so yesterday I saw somebody that I
hadn't seen since that period who also
did hit pieces against me and then that
person surfaced immediately
so I have a feeling that Adam Schiff
actually caught wind
that I might run
and they might actually be worried
which they should be because I would I
would annihilate them let me ask you
let me ask you
my my contention is
that uh from a Communications and
persuasion standpoint he's not my league
like he's sort of in a average
politician level of quality
communication and persuasion which is
not really very high
you know they they basically just lie
about stuff and try to get away with it
there's no technique
but
I'm literally a trained hypnotist
this would not be a fair fight
I'm funnier than him
I'm smarter than him
and I'm way more persuasive
all I'd have to do is be more
entertaining and I'd blown away and I
also don't need any funding whatsoever
do I
you don't think I could make get enough
Free Press
I know how to get free press
there's something I've done before
so I I suspect they're actually worried
I saw a really good CNN bit which I
recommend in which they send a
correspondent into rural China
to see how things are going during their
pandemic opening up
stuff
and
don't let California go to shift vote
for Scott I like it Carpe
um
here's what was fascinating so the CNN
crew kept showing the minders who just
sort of follow you around so that
there'd be these mostly men but at least
one woman who were just following her at
a distance to make sure that all the
towns people knew not to tell her the
truth
it was fascinating like you always hear
about it but to actually watch it in
action and at one point she's just
talking to somebody and then you know
outdoor public space
and the minders simply walk over and
guide the woman away
they just they just take her away
without saying anything they just put an
arm on her and just guide her away from
the conversation it was the damnedest
thing and then apparently there's a crew
everywhere they travel the different one
so they were so coordinated that to be
like six of them following her around
where she was but when they got in the
car to go to another location a
different six would appear
so that's how coordinated their their
observation of foreign presses it was it
was crazy
crazy but then who knows if if the crew
saw reality or not so there might have
been some scrubbing before they
approached anywhere
but it made it look as though the rural
Chinese don't have any problems at all
that the Covenant they treated as a cold
most of them didn't know they had it
didn't sound like they were worried
about anybody dying or being sick and
they're basically over it they have
almost full herd immunity in the rural
areas so the city is maybe being
impacted but their hospitals weren't
even busy
the hospitals was there you know they
said oh we're always busy but it wasn't
you know the the hallways were not
packed or anything
so I recommend it that's that's good job
by CNN when they do their uh packages
they're outside of the mainstream news
uh they're they often are excellent
Dave Rubin visited the Twitter
headquarters and spent two days talking
to the engineers and product managers
and and musk was there as well trying to
get to the bottom
of you know the shadow Banning question
so here's what we learned from Dave
Rubin very excellent report I recommend
his Twitter thread on this
um
the first thing you need to know is that
the the the code that runs Twitter is
apparently so convoluted and spaghetti
code and evolved over time that if you
change anything it breaks all of it
so almost anything you touch don't touch
it you know it is a problem because of
the way it's evolved so there's actually
some thought about you have to throw it
all out and start over but I can't it's
hard to imagine that
but the complexity
is hiding what's going on
so even even the people with the most
knowledge and incentive to find out
what's really going on here
I don't know if they can
the the complexity might be beyond their
control but here are some things that
Dave found that I had not heard yet
apparently there are lots of ways
I'll say several
several would be a lot there are several
ways that Twitter was and is labeling
some tweets
and so there's a whole uh like shades of
shades of shade right so depending on
how it was labeled in the not not cool
category
right there there were things that were
just fine which weren't labeled at all
but anything that was maybe in the gray
area that wasn't cool there was a whole
uh constellation of different ways they
could label them
to suppress them
so you could say one of them was just
you know not good for advertisers
right so you suppress them because
you're an advertising company
uh that's that doesn't mean it's fake
doesn't mean it's violent doesn't mean
it's too sexual it just means they don't
want to pair it with an Advertiser
you know what are you going to do
um and then there are a bunch of other
things for misinformation Etc so
apparently Dave had at least three of
those labels on his account
he has three of them
and it's unclear what any of the three
do exactly because it's too complicated
but they clearly were Banning him and I
think they still are I don't even know
if that I don't even know if the labels
were taken off
but uh but that was new information
and uh I saw the captured
well-known Twitter personality captured
um
was interacting with Dave and Dave said
that they specifically looked at cat
turd's account
and didn't find any Shadow Banning
labels on it
now
I was just imagining how disappointed I
would be
if I were to learn that there were no
labels on my account
because David Dave Rubin got labels on
his account
like he got he got Shadow and the honest
way
but apparently captured is just having
some kind of a psychological problem in
which captured imagines he's being
Shadow abandoned wasn't
and I say to myself
how embarrassing
because I think that might happen to me
as well you know when we assuming we
ever can find out our own status
I'm expecting there will be no labels on
my account
and then I'm going to be all about
feeling bad about it like Jesus
Dave Rubin is so important he gets he
gives Shadow banned but nobody Shadow
bans me
do you know who I am I invented Dilbert
damn it Shadow ban me show me some
respect
show me some respect
I need to be banned
I I'm I'm so competitive that oh yeah
Dave Rubin gets Shadow banned but not me
not me apparently not me not me no but
Dave Rubin does yeah oh yeah he's
important enough to be Shadow banned all
he did is create a competing uh platform
a social media platform
and has one of the you know most popular
podcasts in the political space
but me nothing nothing
quite disappointed I don't know maybe I
have some labels I'll be happy about it
if I do
um
man there's so much going on today what
a fun day
so as I told you parody in reality have
merged but I want to give you an update
on that
so on January 25th I tweeted this
I'm just finding out today let's just
remember this is two days ago I'm just
finding out today thanks to dozens of
people informing me that the coven shots
do not stop transmission did the rest of
you already know that I am so dumb
5.3 million views
because Elon Musk interacted with it
so
um
was that parody
or non-parity
let's let's see if you can tell the
difference I'm going to read it again
and then in the comments I want you to
see if this is a parody
or not I'm just finding out today thanks
to dozens of people informing me that
the coven shots do not stop transmission
did the rest of you already know that I
am so dumb
what was it
oh Sam we can we can help you
will just remove you
there your problem solved
problem solved so I wanted to see um if
I could push this a little further
um
and then I tweeted this this is shocking
next I'll learn the vaccinations were
not tested as long as vaccines are
usually tested
parody
or real opinion
parody Or real opinion
uh well on Twitter jazana Homan
said
Jesus dude where were you under the rock
LOL I really like you but this is too
much
parody
or reality
um
and then Nicola lovig on Twitter said to
me I've been having a hard time lately
determining whether each of your tweets
and responses is sarcasm or truth some
feel one way While others seem another
way
now am I Wrong the parody and reality
emerged you really can't tell it can you
now maybe maybe you think you know on
specific tweets
but in general
you really don't know do you
you really don't know
all right well
here's some things I learned on Twitter
today
um
this is from a Twitter user named AJ
who who tells me I should go back and
listen to the Dark Horse podcast
that's uh Brett Weinstein and Heather uh
hey
and AJ says go back and listen to the
Dark Horse podcast there are years and
hours of listening material to help you
understand I need the help but you don't
want to understand oh
I thought I wanted to understand but AJ
says I don't want to understand okay I
accept that I don't want to understand
AJ you want to grandstand well yeah I do
you know me
grandstander so I want to I want to
understand no I don't want to understand
I want to grandstand so I learned that
today because I was thinking the
opposite I thought I did want to
understand and okay you're right about
the second thing I do like the
grandstand
so I tweeted uh why am I like this
everyone else finds the accurate
information I only find the wrong stuff
parody
or real opinion
can't tell can't tell can you
um
and then uh Twitter user Minneapolis to
Texas said uh all good brother it
happened to a ton of folks just start
tuning into Dark Horse now it will help
clarify a bunch of stuff for you and he
says they got it right they weren't
lucky they reasoned their way there now
that's what I need to learn to do and
they want to help me oh
thank you they want to help me
so I should tune in
So I responded
and you get to decide is this parody or
real opinion
I responded uh wait until you find out
all documentaries are persuasive
including the ones that are wrong
had exploding icon
but then I wanted to clarify I said Dark
Horse got everything right
you knew by listening to the podcast but
I got all caught up in the wrong field
of science that says humans can't do
what you did see here is my problem
I was in the wrong field of science
had I been in the field of let's say
biology and stuff like that I might have
I might have immediately known that the
Dark Horse podcast was onto everything
right
but I got all bunched up in the wrong
part of science I went down the
psychology
part of the scientific field now in the
in the psychology field it would be well
understood that nobody can do
what these people say they did
you can't actually you can't actually
look at somebody talking about somebody
else's science
and know anything
so there's a whole field of science that
says this can't be done
I was in the wrong hole wrong hole
had I been in the biology field only I
would have known who was getting it
right and I would immediately seen that
their reasoning
was complete and nothing had been left
out
but because I went down the psychology
field where it's very clear that nobody
can do that know who's right if they
don't have the expertise themselves and
even if they did sometimes they don't
know who's right
but I do not have any ability to analyze
the Dark Horse podcast and know from my
own or any mechanism that I know how to
gather whether they are right or wrong
but I will take it on faith that there
are people walking Among Us who can do
just that
they don't believe that field of science
that fooled me
so I'm living in sort of an illusion
that the field of psychology is actually
real science
and that's what I got wrong
well Russia got some tanks I guess this
happened a month ago but I just saw the
news today they got uh 30 t-34 tanks
so that sounds pretty good 30 tanks they
were produced in 1944
which means they were probably designed
in the 30s
and they were brought back to Russia
from Laos
so
that's a strong play on the Russian side
um you know Ukraine was feeling pretty
confident
until they heard that Russia got 30
tanks that were designed in the 1930s
from Laos apparently they're in good
working order
good working order they're horse-drawn I
don't know if the news didn't mentioned
they're horse-drawn tanks but uh
I think they'll do well they'll do well
so it looks like Russia is uh gearing up
for uh for a fight
with those horse-drawn tanks from Laos
no they're not horse-drawn
not horseshawn they were simply designed
in the 1930s that's not horse-drawn that
would be crazy
well Nikki Klein you may remember her
name from Nexium
but uh she had this question for men on
Twitter
she said men do you feel like you can
give women honest feedback if not why
not
and I I answered LOL no women get angry
when you tell the truth
and also when you lie so those are the
two traps to avoid
so if I could give you any kind of a
relationship advice
two things you don't want to do
once you're in a relationship
Never Lie
that's going to really cause trouble
and never ever tell the truth
because that's just going to be a fight
so don't lie and don't tell the truth
if you can avoid those two things
your relationship has a good chance I've
never figured it out myself I'm I'm as
useless on this as I am in figuring out
whether the Dark Horse podcast was right
or wrong but I accept now that they were
right about everything
same as I do in a relationship I just
assume I'm wrong
um
all right I'm going to add something to
the conversation about excess deaths
this is where some of you just get mad
at me and leave
does anybody want to storm off after
insulting me for continuing to beat on
this topic I'll wait for your insults
and angry and angry turning and leaving
go
because you're going to see something
that you've not seen before on this
argument I promise you I'll give you
something that's new unless you saw me
tweet it yesterday this will be brand
new something you never heard
all right
go into the Whiteboard oh doubtful oh
hold on hold on
skeptic
are you doubting that I'm gonna make a
point that you have not seen
and that it's an important one do you
doubt that
now unless you saw me tweet this last
night
I promise you you have not seen this
point
and it's a big one
you ready
somebody says it's going to be stupid
thank you for the faith
all right
there are many potential causes of
excess deaths could be vax injury
let me
Alexa cancel
I don't know what that's about
um
do we all agree
that even the vaccination manufacturers
would agree with us that some people
are probably dying from the vaccination
itself
is that is that a you know we don't know
how many right the number of them is is
questioned but there's no doubt about it
right
can you fact check me
that all vaccinations have negative
effects and if you give a vaccination to
100 million people
somebody dies you just don't know if
that's a big deal or a small deal right
the death of the person is a big deal of
course
all right there might be some long
coveted
now long covet doesn't have to be
defined as something exotic
you know it could be just that you you
got your ass kicked and you're 80 years
old if you get your ass kicked by covid
and you're already 80 years old maybe
the next year or so you're never really
get back to the health you had before so
one could imagine people being weakened
potentially now this is just
hypothetical this is not Based on data
but don't would you agree
than if a hundred million people get
covered
some of them have their ass kicked but
they survive
don't you think that that would cause
you to be weakened for other things for
quite some time like you would never get
back to your physical fitness for
example
yeah maybe so I'm not saying that I'm
not saying that that's part of the
number I'm just saying it's one of the
unknowns
all right what about overdoses young
people a huge increase in overdoses
Fentanyl and alcohol and everything else
we've got more suicide we know more
murder we know so overdose is suicide
and murder
we know are high
but on top of that there seems to be
some excess death even more than that so
some of it is completely explained
by these factors now we know that
depression and anxiety through the roof
they pretty much directly you know in a
big population they're going to directly
translate into deaths right
obesity of course is going to kill
people here's the new one all right
those of you who challenged me and said
I wouldn't make a new new point
are you aware
that it's a pretty well established fact
that if a spouse dies the odds of the
remaining spouse also dying
in a year or so is very high relative to
you know chance
right
now what happens if a whole bunch of
seniors especially or let's say anybody
over 40 but the people who died are
mostly seniors a whole bunch of seniors
lose their partner after 60 years of
being together
all right that's what happened to my
parents
my mother died you know my parents were
together from the time my mother was 18.
she was engaged at the age of 16.
right to the same man
they were together all those years
she died and what did the family member
say
we we gave him like a year
and he didn't have a special medical
problem I think he was gone in 18 months
I think it was around 18 months and it
was just a straight decline yeah he just
he was done now you could see you could
see the the psychological part of that
just so clearly right I mean I will
think it was a coincidence now this is
actually in effect
uh this is an effect that's well
demonstrated right I think most doctors
have seen it and it it even the the data
backed up so what we should see
is excess deaths of the partner dying
from heartbreak
so it should be
a pretty big effect in fact it might be
the biggest effect we've ever seen of
this type just because the way it all
played out
um there's also a post-crisis effect
so after a big war or after a big
upheaval or a revolution uh doctors no
that heart attacks go way up did you
know that
yeah there's heart inflammation and you
know stress is basically the effect of
long-term stress
so after the pandemic and I guess you
could sort of say we're after it now you
should expect to see a whole bunch of
excess deaths
that are predictable
right what about distrust of Health Care
I stopped taking two meds this year
because I don't trust Health Care
do you think anybody else did that do
you think anybody else stopped taking
their meds because they don't trust
health care or they couldn't get them or
they couldn't get into the hospital or
they don't want to even get near the
hospital how about the people who would
normally go to the hospital but they're
afraid of getting covered and they think
well the hospital's full of covet I
don't want to have the problem I have
plus covet so maybe they don't go so
there's certainly some distrust of
healthcare that's got to have effect
what about Hospital mistakes
Hospital mistakes are something like the
third biggest cause of death aren't they
yeah it's like the third largest cause
of death
I'm speculating here
if you take any system that's working
and then you throw a whole new variable
into it like something that shocks the
system does it work as well
no like because this big complicated
system if you throw covid in the
pandemic into the hospital system it
should create more errors right just
because any change to a system could
will create errors now I'm not even
talking about the ventilators
I'm talking about the continued effect
to today because we're we're past the
ventilators I think
but don't you think that hospital I'm
just guessing but I'll bet you Hospital
errors are through the roof because I
think we lost a lot of good Health Care
Professionals didn't we
you know fatigue death but also change
of process
because you have all the work you were
doing plus you got to put in covid
protocols right
um your doctor told you it was okay
well
is my doctor monitoring me I mean I'm
basically
you know my doctor suggested that
but I'm I'm doing it all myself right
I'm monitoring myself Etc all right but
I get your point there's also an
economic effect
uh when the economy is bad people die
and they die from a whole variety of
reasons that are probably you know
embedded in some of this other stuff and
then there's also something called the
nocebo effect
sort of a cousin to the placebo effect
the placebo effect
30 to 60 percent of the people who take
a drug or a pill that is literally
nothing
get better
30 to 60 percent
get better with a sugar pill
you know when they're testing against a
real pill
it also works the other way
if somebody believes something's going
to be bad for them let's say you gave
them the pill you say you know this
probably is going to be bad for you
probably 30 percent of the people would
report something bad happened
and maybe it would like if you tested
them you actually found something bad so
the the psychology Body Connection is so
strong
that what you expect
has about a 30 chance of happening even
if there's no physical reason they
should
and it works both in the positive way
but in the negative way too so how many
people believed that covid would kill
them
a lot
do you think that if you looked at the
people who believed that kovid was no
big deal if you could isolate them and
then they got coveted and then the group
who thought it was deadly and they were
going to die and they also got covered
do you think the death rates
would make sense for their demographics
I mean they wouldn't be directly
comparable you'd have to adjust it for
demographics
I I say that the people who were afraid
of covid were more likely to die all
other things controlled what do you say
everything I know about psychology
placebos and nocebos
strongly suggests
that people were dying who wouldn't have
died if they weren't afraid of dying
now let's go the other way
how many people maybe got the
vaccination slash shot that isn't a
vaccination
how many people got the shot and then
later through social media or their
friends whatever became frightened to
death that the shot itself would kill
them
and it's a and it's 100 million people
if a hundred million people worry that
the shot itself will kill them let's say
half them 50 million
how many of them would actually die who
wouldn't have died otherwise
and the answer is it's going to be a big
number
I think
based on everything we know about
placebos and nocebos and psychology and
connection of mind to body
there should be people dying like crazy
because they're afraid of the
vaccination
and wouldn't have died otherwise just
the fear itself should be killing people
like crazy
right or wrong
disagree
right so now
here's let me give the counter argument
okay
here's the counter argument
the counter arguments
is that the increase in excess deaths
Maps almost perfectly to the vaccination
introduction
that's a strong argument would you agree
it's pretty strong are you yeah
it it would take a coincidence
for that not to be showing you exactly
what it looks like
right because what it looks like
is that there's one cause that you know
rises above the others it would take a
pretty big coincidence
for that not to mean exactly what it
looks like would you agree
so you would have to explain why every
demographic
started Having excess deaths at around
the time of the the rollout
here's the best that you could do if
you're trying to explain that away
these effects affect all demographics
different ones affect different
demographics differently so the Widow
effect would affect the older people
more
but the suicides and overdoses would
affect the younger people more
and then all of it would affect
everybody a little bit
now when when would the excess deaths
start kicking in
would people be dying from the nocebo
effect before they had a vaccination
they wouldn't it would have to be after
the vaccination
would um
would people be dying of long coveted
right after they got actual coveted
no if if there is any long-term impact
of just being weakened in general that
might have happened a year later
so there might be people who are
infected a year later and by the time
the vaccinations came
that's when the long long covet is
kicking their ass as well
just by coincidence
how many of the Widow effects would
happen the same day
as the original partner dies almost none
they would lag about a year
so you'd have all these deaths in 2020
and then you would see the partners
start to die a year later
that's what you would expect
what about the post-crisis effect
well
when the when the vaccinations rolled
out
there were a lot of people who said okay
we're you know we're after the crisis
now because now we can vaccinate
ourselves and be safe now I'm not saying
that's true I'm saying that's how people
felt
so at the time of the vaccinations the
post-crisis effect should have started
at the same time as the vaccinations
because that's when people thought they
were done with the they thought the
pandemic might be done
so the post-crisis is after the crisis
and the vaccinations might be a period
where people were feeling post-crisy
Maybe
distrust of Health Care that probably
started small and grew but it was always
there Hospital mistakes were probably
worse
don't you think Hospital mistakes were
very high
at the same time the vaccinations were
coming up
should have been everything we know
would suggest that's when they were the
highest because it was the most
variables and overwork and every other
bad thing
economic effect is a little more gradual
we should see more of that now than we
saw them although actually people were
scared to death about their economic
situation during the pandemic so this
might have actually started earlier
and maybe even got worse
uh and then I I guess I spoke about all
these all right
given all of this
did you learn something here that you
didn't know go
did I tell you something that you had
not heard before that was useful
that was also useful
it's a mixed bag
egg with glasses
nope I'm a biologist oh so there's a
biologist here who knew the Widow effect
how many of you knew the Widow effect
and knew that it would be part of excess
deaths
a lot of some of you did
some of you did and and you actually
knew to connect that to excess deaths
well I'm impressed
all right David we see you we see you
you don't have to say that a hundred
times
um
and by the way
so so let me here's a remember I told
you you can't
determine parity from reality so David G
is just shouting in caps you know
message after message all the same and
he says Scott figured it down again guys
he really is the pandemic's best
predictor
parody
or actual opinion
there's no difference
there's no difference they're just the
same now you can't even tell
you knew from working in the cemetery oh
somebody knew about the
yeah you would know yeah if you if you
worked in a cemetery you would know when
you dug the grave for one partner and
you would know when you dug the matching
grave for the other partner so there's a
cemetery worker who knew about the the
Widow effect that makes perfect sense
um
oh here's an interesting comment
NPC Jester says no I'm sorry
um somebody said that I'm at Peak
persuasion now
Peak influence
because Elon magnified me
what do you think am I a peak influence
yes I am it's all downhill from here
well Peak so far
Peaks so far
speak sarcasm
go after Chef you got it
we'll take care of him all right ladies
and gentlemen
this brings me to the end of the best
live stream you've ever had I'm going to
make the locals
people private and I'm going to say
goodbye to you YouTube people
stay tuned
and
and we'll talk to you later
