do you know why ESG
is a looks like a nightmare to
Republicans
but looks like the best thing in the
world for Democrats
it's this
Republicans look at the system and they
say wait a minute we have a system where
there would be a company
competing you know foreign shareholders
and it would do whatever it could as an
independent company you know within the
law to to maximize and then that worked
we had the most dynamic economy
so that's a republican system
and then the Democrats are people who
only exist to insult other people
and they say we're going to insult you
in three different ways we're going to
call you a racist because you don't have
enough equity and inclusion
we're going to call you a science denier
because you're not doing enough about
the environment
basically we're going to come up with
some insults and then we're going to
destroy your system
by creating this confusing set of
entities that are you know judging you
and and trying to determine whether
you're worthy of investment and buying
their products so basically all
Republicans know that if you add this
extra burden of of three different
preferences like it's not even one thing
it's not even just about the environment
it's about government governance plus
the environment plus you know social
responsibility so there there's all
these murky things if you put that on
top of free markets is that a better
system or a worse one
every Republican knows that's worse
now it's hard to explain why it's worse
to people who don't understand the
systems
have to be designed to you know work
with human characteristics Etc
so you're always going to have the
Democrats saying let's find a new way to
insult people I got it
will say that they don't have enough
diversity therefore they're racist
how else can we insult people I got it
they're not doing enough for climate
change so therefore they're science
deniers
right but basically the Democrats are
always looking for the angle to insult
you
and the Republicans if they framed it
correctly would always be looking for
the way to make a system that works for
everybody
and invite the Democrats in
Vite the Democrats in
