hey everybody
good morning good to see you all
today it's time for an exciting and
provocative
episode of coffee with scott adams
yes exciting and provocative just the
way you like them
and in order to have the maximum amount
of pleasure
and to make sure that this is the the
launch of your day
the part that makes all of it better
you don't need much it's really easy all
you need is a
copper marker glass of tanker chalzer's
dying a canteen jugger flask of vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the dopamine
hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous up
it's going to happen right now go
yes i feel the civil discourse in this
country
improving one percent and that was just
one sip
imagine if i finished that whole cup
it's hard to imagine isn't it
well let's talk about all the news
um let's see first first first we have
the trump administration
has rejected a california request
for disaster declaration
now so california asked for some
financial help from the federal
government
because of all the forest fires and that
was rejected and so i looked for the
reason
and i thought well certainly a story
about a major
thing being rejected there's going to be
a reason
but i didn't see a reason now maybe
there will be a reason
it could be that a reason will be
forthcoming but if there is no reason
given
what would you have to assume what would
be the default assumption
if no reason is given in the news the
default assumption is that it's
political
if it's political then i certainly could
not support
president trump anymore now if we don't
hear
what the reason was you have to just
assume it was political
and then you end up in the same place i
do just specifically me
because an attack on california would be
an attack on me
because i live in california let me tell
you a story
just so you can get some context uh
during the obama administration
i had been you know a silent but
supportive
person of president obama
i don't know if many of you knew that
but if you're finding out for the first
time
i was perfectly happy with president
obama until
until he changed his opinion on
going after marijuana dispensaries in
california
now california said that dispensaries
were okay
obama had run for office saying he
wasn't going to bother the states
whatever they wanted to do was fine and
then he reversed himself
which would have put a california
resident who started a dispensary
would have put him in jail for 10 years
for doing something that the government
told him will be okay
obama said it would be okay we're not
going to go after you
the state set is legal he started up his
what he believed to be a perfectly
sanctioned business
and then obama changed the law and
it looked like he was going to go to
jail for 10 years
at that point i said i'm out i'm out
if obama had given a reason for changing
his opinion
i would have said well i'll listen to
the reason and then if the reason that
had been a good one
i'd say ah okay i hate the fact
that he changed his opinion i hate the
fact that puts this guy in jeopardy
when he was following the rules as he
understood them
but at least i understand the reasoning
president obama never offered that
reason
and so the default assumption is it was
for political reasons
or there was some funding involved maybe
there was a backer of some type
maybe the maybe the alcohol industry
didn't want marijuana to be legal
i don't know what it was but by not
giving a reason
he was completely disqualified for
office
that was an argument i made at the time
the way that was interpreted is that i
endorsed
romney for president over obama but
it wasn't so much that i loved romney i
didn't know much about him
just that he wasn't wasn't obama and
obama had done something that was just
disqualifying
it doesn't matter what other good things
you do
doesn't matter if you go after a citizen
and put a citizen in jail for political
or monetary reasons
while you're president you're you're as
disqualified
as you can be you can't get more
disqualified than that
and so i will say i'll put the same
standard on this story
if it turns out that there's a reason
could be the
californian didn't apply for it
correctly or they just don't have the
money or something
i'll listen to the reason but if there's
no reason
it's just rejected you have to assume
it's political
and that's targeted at me because i live
in california
if that's the case then i would say the
president would not be qualified
for office just based on that alone and
i'm not even done
so do you remember when immigration was
a big issue
doesn't that feel like a long time ago
now
what happened where is the reporting
is the reporting on immigration
did immigration stop did it become
less of an issue or do we just stop
reporting it it makes you wonder about
the nature of
news doesn't it how can something be the
biggest news
immigration and then just sort of stop
being the biggest news
is it because it stopped because that
would be news too right if the
amount of immigration went way down for
some reason
either because they're doing better job
at the border or because of coronavirus
or something it's big news
no matter what's happening but it just
disappeared
and so the question i have to ask is did
it disappear
because whatever the news is and i don't
know
because it's not reported is it because
that would have been
positive for trump is that why it
disappeared
because you did at least expect fox news
to be reporting it if it's good news for
trump
but it just disappeared i don't know i
just have an open question on that
there's a horrible story about a man
who lost his father to coronavirus but
also
seven other family members the same
family
and two of them were young kids young i
saw a picture
looked like they were 10 or 11 years old
maybe 9 10 11.
now if you lose two kids in your family
that are young and they're in that the
age group that basically nobody should
be dying from coronavirus
and you lose seven members of your
entire family
doesn't that tell you there's a genetic
element we don't yet
understand i'm not the statistics expert
but what are the odds of this family
having that many problems
from coronavirus it's not an accident
that the entire family gets infected
that would be normal but to lose seven
members of the family and two of them
are children
that is such a strong indication i would
think
or you know certainly not proof of
anything because as i've told you before
statistics can cluster it's possible you
not possible it's guaranteed that you
always get little weird unexplained
clusters of things and when you look at
it
the big picture they they sort of
disappear in importance
because statistics allows that sometimes
just by chance
things cluster up is that what happened
with this family
did they just have the worst luck in the
world
i don't think so you know they look like
they had some
maybe some weight issues in the family
but not the two children
the two children didn't have any special
weight issues
so i'd love to know more about the
the dna elements there um if you're not
following jake novak on twitter you
should be
novak nov ak because he has the best
tweets on anything that's happening in
the middle east
that would also be relative to the
united states and to politics in
particular
and one of the things he tweeted which i
don't know if you saw anywhere else
tell me if you saw this this news
anywhere else
but but zogby did a poll
and found that in saudi arabia eighty
percent of saudis are in favor of
working toward normalizing ties with
israel
within the next five years
seventy one percent even thinking it
likely that other arab nations will
normalize
ties with israel and the palestinians
think about that 80 percent
of saudis want to just get along with
israel
that is gigantic news because it largely
guarantees it's going to happen
given that there's some momentum in that
direction
now i was kind of thinking that that
this might be one of the october
surprises
because it would just be some amazing
good news for trump
and if there if ever there was a country
that owed
trump a favor
name the country that owes trump a favor
beyond all other countries you might say
israel
israel would be a good guess but that's
more about
long-term you know good allies working
together well
but saudi arabia owes president trump
specifically the crown prince
owes president trump more than anybody
ever owed
any other leader because trump did give
him cover
on the whole khashoggi affair
and i said at the time
i said at the time this is creating a
situation that might have a payback
later
because trump played it to get the chip
that's what it looked like it looked
like he was playing the game
to get this favor to create an asset out
of nothing
if trump had simply condemned saudi
arabia like everybody else did
he would have not had a free favor
but given that nobody's opinion about
saudi arabia was changed in
any way based on what trump said
i don't think there's a person in the
world who who listened to trump's
opinion
on khashoggi and saudi arabia and said
yeah i think i'll take that opinion
i don't think anybody did that so it
didn't change
anybody's opinion which is good
but he got a free asset which is what
trump does he carves a free asset
and nothing he got a favor out of it
future favor
if this turns out to be the future favor
the saudi arabia maybe
you know accelerates their timeline for
for making uh good with israel
that would be a gigantic favor so i
wouldn't rule it out
but uh but i also think we might have
heard about it by now so
uh certainly not guaranteed
i tweeted that i'm looking to do a
recorded interview
before election with
somebody who's an anti-trumper i just
want to do
a citizen who's got serious tds
not necessarily professional a lot of
people were
were suggesting to me names how about
this person how about this person
why don't you talk to sam harris etc but
i'd rather talk to a
just a voter somebody who wouldn't mind
going in public and just just giving me
their full
best argument about trump and just see
how it goes
now unfortunately i asked on twitter and
i got over a thousand responses
of which everyone that i looked at was
the wrong kind
they were suggesting people as opposed
to people suggesting themselves
which is what i was hoping for so i
don't know if i'll be able to pour
through all thousand
but if there's somebody who wants to do
that doesn't mind a little
uh public attention i'd like to do that
but a non-professional would be
ideal you could be a professional you
know lawyer or professional something
else
but not a not a not a public pundit
um so
in news that just sort of slipped under
the radar a little bit
the world health organizations just
announced that
rem deserver doesn't work did you see
that coming
who had a bet on the world health
organization
declaring that rem deserver doesn't work
now of course the company that makes rem
deserver
uh is uh is pushing back on that gilead
and so i guess it was some big
trial and the result of it was that
they didn't see any benefit of rem
deserve and
um
rem dev severe responded by saying well
we're not sure that new study is so
robust because we have these other
studies that say it does work
so what does that do to rem deserver
first of all does anybody believe the
world health organization about anything
anymore
you know is there anybody who said oh
the world health organization
says rem deserver doesn't work based on
the study
but what does that do
i mean the world health organization is
not exactly
credible and the question i'd ask is
does china
have anything that competes with rem
deserve
uh you see where i'm going see where i'm
going with this
it could be that there's a chinese
pharmaceutical
that is the competitor to rem deserve
and their
their pet the world health organization
is just
helping china sell their drug instead of
rem deserve
do we live in a world where something
like that could actually happen
like right in front of us you know are
we in the kind of a world where the
world health organization could just
blatantly ignore
science and facts and reason and just
back china because china will make more
money from a pharmaceutical yeah yeah
that's exactly the world we live in i'm
not saying that that happened
i'm not making that claim i'm just
saying that
it's the first place i'd look i mean
based on past
behavior the very first thing i'd look
at is
does china have a rem deserve your
competitor
just asking
all right um so trump has
made the claim that some i i don't know
how he words it but it sounds something
like
85 percent of people who got coronavirus
were wearing masks
which he says to put doubt into the
question of whether
masks work now tucker carlson also did
an episode on that
and i also
tried to debunk it when tucker carlson
did it
because it doesn't say what you think it
says
so there's nobody the the study did not
indicate that masks don't work and
that's the way it was
being used or suggested that that was
the implication
by tucker carlson probably that's where
trump saw it
so trump was echoing the you know the
doubt about masks based on this 85
study but without getting into the
details the study doesn't say that
so the study is silent on whether masks
work
you can't you can't determine from this
study
whether masks are good or bad it's not
that kind of a study
so and jake tapper called them out uh
quite aggressively on cnn
appropriately i would say
and i'll go so i'll go further and say i
don't know if the
polls are accurate you know they're
showing this gigantic
lead for biden and i have some questions
about the accuracy of the polls
but i will say this if trump uh loses
the election
he earned it he earned it i think that
um if you're president of the united
states and it's
yesterday and you're still in public
casting doubt on the efficacy of masks
and you're publicly modeling a lack
of social distancing you deserve to lose
the election
you know i hate to say it you know i
said this before
people have said to me scott you're
going to feel so bad
when you know the people who believe
that trump is going to lose they say
you're going to feel so bad i can't wait
to come back and gloat
and i'm not going to have that feeling
at all
honestly if trump loses this thing
he earned the loss and you're doing this
now i would have a personal problem with
them about that california wildfire
funding thing
but we might we might find out that
there was actually a good reason that
that was rejected
i could think of lots of good reasons to
reject it i just haven't heard one
but on this issue there's nothing that's
going to change my mind
at this point in the coronavirus
having the president you know actively
and aggressively i would say
question the efficacy of masks and the
efficacy of
large gatherings is completely
disqualifying
yeah you just can't stay on this train
anymore i'm sorry
i mean i know that you will and i know
you'll be mad at me for
for falling off it but this is
completely disqualifying
i i would guess that trump's statement
about masks and this 85 percent of
people
if i had to put a number on it it
probably killed 50 000 people
there you have it if i had to guess
how many people extra will die because
of the president's up
probably 50 000 people
if you doubt that it's because you doubt
social distancing
works or matters and you doubt that
masks are effective
i will allow you to maintain that doubt
but someday we're going to know
someday we're going to know now i can't
guarantee
that i could estimate in any way you
know any difference in death toll based
on masks or social distancing
i don't have the skill to estimate that
but we all have to make a decision based
on our best
judgment with the incomplete knowledge
we have
the incomplete understanding of science
that we all have
we're just sort of doing our best with
the bad
information we have and my best
judgment is that masks make a difference
and i'll and i'll boil down my argument
to this
virus doesn't travel by itself you all
agree with this part
the virus has to be on a water particle
right
a virus could easily get through a mask
a water particle
some of them can even most of them i
think
water particles also travel in the air
so you need the virus you need the water
and you need the air if you don't have
all three of those things
the virus isn't going anywhere you all
agree with that so far right
so if you agree it takes all three
things a virus
you need the water droplets and you need
the air
as the carrier if all those things are
necessary
i want you to do this experiment put on
your mask
hold the lick handle in front of you and
try to blow it out
if you can blow out the candle masks
don't work they don't work because if
you can blow on a candle no problem
it means that there's virus water
and air coming right through the front
of the mask
in such force that it would be
equivalent to if you had no mask on at
all
if you can't blow out the candle
would you at least feel there's a little
more chance
that masks might work now
the entire medical community uh when i
say entire i'd say
probably 95 of it and all the experts
are on the same side the masks are
essential
and work probably 95 percent
could they be wrong is it possible that
someday in the future
there'll be some way we find out for
sure
if if the coronavirus situation
was the one weird situation where the
masks don't make any difference
could we find that out we could
anything's possible
but if you're playing the odds and
you're
you're doing your best job to decide
what's right
the odds are just overwhelmingly
in favor of masks making some difference
as
as well as social distancing because the
the outbreaks that we see are so clearly
related to social distancing
and now they're becoming increasingly
clearly related to
not wearing masks
i feel the president may have killed 50
000 people
by by his interpretation
of mask efficacy that's my guess
probably 50 000 people and i would say
you know i said in the beginning of this
pandemic
that all of the leaders all the experts
are going to make some pretty bad
mistakes
but we should be forgiving because
everybody's guessing
in the beginning everybody was just
guessing and i'm quite forgiving about
those particular mistakes uh however
it's not the beginning anymore at this
point
we're well into it
somebody says concentrate on the
recovery rate
well we'll see um we'll find out in the
next few months whether everything gets
worse or better
and then the other thing that is
disqualifying is that trump
still at this late date has not uh
presented a health care plan per se
so there's nothing with a branded name
that you could say this is trump's plan
and at the same time he doesn't have
anything like a package or
or a branded healthcare plan he
is not doing a good job of removing
people's fear
that if obamacare gets overthrown by the
courts
that they won't just lose their coverage
now he
now trump has said
it is my policy you're not going to lose
your
coverage because of conditions you
already had so pre-existing conditions
now he has said that and he said it
clearly he's even done an executive
order
and still he has not said it
persuasively
now do i believe that the president has
the ability to be persuasive
yes yes he does
see that book behind me i wrote a whole
book on how persuasive the president is
and why is it that he can't persuade the
public
that he really means to give them real
health care that's better
and that he won't get rid of the health
care until he's got something that's
better
it's a very simple message people i know
you're
you're afraid but let me tell you one
thing for sure
i'm not going to get rid of the health
care that exists the obamacare
i'm not going to touch it until we've
got something that's better
and that it doesn't leave anybody
uncovered and that there are no
uh pre-existing condition people who get
screwed because this
so this is what i promise you and you
can hold me to it
i will not will not introduce
new healthcare you know
i'm sorry i will not get rid of what you
have until you absolutely can move to
something better without any risk
did you hear how clearly i said that did
it sound convincing
you know if i'd been president yeah yeah
that would have sounded convincing
because we know the president can hit a
message
and keep it simple all day long there's
nobody who's ever been better as
simplifying and repeating
and just making sure you know i mean to
build a wall
is there anybody here who wondered does
trump intend to build a wall
nope there's nobody who has any doubt
about his intentions to build a wall no
doubt at all
you might like it you might not like it
but you don't doubt it
but in healthcare why is it that with
healthcare
he can't sell that simple message you're
not going to lose anything
until and only under this condition
we have something you can move to
seamlessly that's just
better just better cost you less
give you just as much or a better
protection period if i can't give you
that
i'm not getting rid of anything because
we're only we're only interested in
improving
nobody has an interest in anybody losing
their health care that's the
last thing i want so if i can tell you
one thing for sure
you're not going to lose any health care
you're only going to maybe get better
health care
period that's the only thing that could
happen now listen to what i just said
you tell me that that's not easy to do
that's
easy trump isn't doing it
times run out you know i was kind of
waiting oh maybe
maybe in that last month he'll put
something together nope
nope it's pretty obvious there's not
going to be any kind of a
trump health care plan and it is now
completely obvious that he's not going
to even try very hard
to convince you you're not going to lose
your health care
all right that's not even really trying
all right i don't even know if trump
wants to win at this point
because it's so obvious what he would
need to do to win
it's like he's not even playing to win
and then last night
you know he gets he gets asked the the
softball
question of all softball questions
and he whiffs he whiffs on a softball
uh and it goes like this how come you
won't
uh why are you not why are you hesitant
basically i'm paraphrasing
uh savannah guthrie you know why you've
been hesitant
to denounce white supremacy
and again he blew it
i don't know how many times you can you
can miss that softball
before even your supporters start saying
um
i i don't believe you're a white
supremacist and i don't believe that
you're sending them
any kind of a racist whistle that's my
view i don't believe
anything like that's happening but it's
the world's easiest question
and there's one way to do it right and
there's every other way to do it which
is wrong let me explain the right way to
do it
do you why are you so hesitant to
denounce white supremacists
um i'm not hesitant at all i denounce it
completely
i denounced the neo-nazis the white
supremacists
uh i denounce all forms of racism and
i'll even go further i denounce
anti-fa i got some issues with black
lives matter
any kind of hate like that i i'm
absolutely out and if there's anything
i've ever said in the past
it was more because of the way the
question was asked i just didn't like to
get pushed into
you know repeating somebody's claim but
i want to i want to tell you
no doubt about it 100 let's never even
talk about it again
i disavow the hell out of those guys i
can't disavow them any more than i have
but instead now you heard my answer
right
did my answer sound like i was
equivocating
no it didn't because i wasn't
you can tell when somebody's
equivocating what does trump do
well you know you you keep trying this
trick
and immediately the flag goes up um why
don't you first answer the question
and then he gets into that he's he's
said it many times
before true and it's a good defense
i've i've you know debunked them many
times before
but once you get a little whiny about
that
it's still taking away from the main
thing which is why wasn't the first
freaking thing you said
i denounced them all in the clearest
possible language now let me tell you
why
you know this is fake news in the first
place you can get to the fake news part
and the part that you've done it many
times
but you don't want to lead off with that
because that's defensive
sounds like you're making a case sounds
like you're trying to be a lawyer a
little bit
don't be a lawyer don't be a lawyer on
the question of do you denounce
white supremacists that's not something
that you equivocate on
it's not something you beat around the
bush it's not something you
you know trim the trim the hedges on
you've got to go right down the middle
on that
every time now again let me be clear i
don't think there's any chance
that trump is supporting the white
supremacists he never said they were
fine people that's fake news
you know i don't believe he's sending
any kind of a whistle to them
i think that's nonsense but man talk
about not being able to answer a
question well
that's that's really disappointing you
got to say
and then he does the same thing with q
anon
now uh so he was asked if he supports
them
and savannah guthrie says that they
believe that democrats are a bunch of
pedophile uh organized pedophile ring or
something
and and then trump says i don't know
anything about him
and then savannah guthrie says i just
told you
they believe there's this big pedophile
ring do you denounce that
and he wouldn't do it how hard would it
be
to say you know i'm not signing on to
any of that stuff
but i i certainly appreciate the fact
that they're so
anti-pedophile now he did say he
appreciated the anti-pedophilia part
that was right but it would have been so
easy to say
you know i haven't really looked into
the details if what you say is true
that's not something i believe in but i
can't speak to it in any detail
but what you've said obviously that's
not something that i endorse
how hard would it be to do that how hard
would it be
would he lose q anon if he did that
would he i doubt it i don't think he'd
lose their votes
but he would at least make everybody
else feel he was you know
handling that question a little bit
better all right
i've got some bad things to say about
biden too case
in case you're disappointed
um so biden
uh said that uh he would
give the voters his opinion on court
packing
uh before the election but not now so
he's going to base his opinion on court
packing
on how the amy coney barrett thing is
handled
now even van jones gave him a d minus
give him a d minus for that answer
that answer is disqualifying it is
it is disrespectful to voters it's
dismissive of voters
because we do want to know this question
he does have an opinion
he does owe us the answer and finally he
admitted he
that that he owes voters an answer he
said the other day that
you know they don't deserve an answer
which was a really bad answer
and
amazingly that was his answer
i i would say that that displays a level
of
disrespect for voters as well as lack of
competence
that is disqualifying so in the same way
that
i think trump disqualified himself
recently on the coronavirus stuff i
would say that biden has just
disqualified himself as just being
competent
now i believe that trump is largely very
competent
on a whole bunch of areas i think he's
probably the best president we've ever
had on
economics and international affairs
so i would i would be able to support
that very easily
so on those two really really big things
international affairs and and domestic
economics
i don't think you could beat trump and
if those were the things you cared about
the most
he'd be you're a candidate for sure but
biden is just generally incompetent
and not even being able to answer this
simple question
that clearly the public wants to know
about because this court-packing thing
isn't a small issue
if core packing happens it is the end of
the republic
and that's pretty easy to predict
because the core system would no longer
be an independent body
they would be a captive of the executive
and
and congress if they were the same party
um
so so that's disqualifying uh
by the way trump did say he would
peacefully leave office if he lost
but he he fought a little bit before he
gave the direct answer so that was
terrible and then he gave an answer on
debts so savannah guthrie asked
trump about uh do you owe this 400
whatever a million
and he answered the question correctly
and he answered it in a way that if you
understood finance
you would know exactly what he meant and
you would realize that the issue is a
non-issue
if you understand economics and finance
you know that it doesn't matter
if the president has debt that would be
pretty much
everybody in the real estate business
people have debt
it doesn't mean he owes more than he's
worth
it means that if he has this much net
value
he probably has some fraction of that
that's debt
just like anybody who has a mortgage now
he did throw in that mortgage example at
one point but
it was modeled he needs a clean answer
for that debt thing and i think that he
did not give one
i would guess that people who didn't
understand finance and economics
were still left to think he owed
somebody a lot of money and they don't
know who
and it bothers them so i i think he
botched that answer
um trunk then biden
went back and forth on fracking he was
against it he's for it
now he's now he doesn't support a ban on
it but does that mean he wouldn't
stop giving licenses to new applications
or is it only on government land
so fracking again one of the biggest
issues in the country for
certainly in a lot of the states biden
won't give you an answer that you can
even know what he means
so again biden doesn't give you a court
packing answer
he doesn't give you a fracking answer
that you can depend on
he gives an answer but it's he's all
over the place
how do you elect a president who won't
even tell you his opinion
on the most important issues that's
completely disqualifying
completely i would rather have somebody
tell me an opinion that i didn't like
than to say well i'm not going to tell
you or you know change my opinion every
day
and in a way if you look at what biden
is becoming he's becoming almost
uh trump light because if trump
if if biden is not against fracking
and he said he's also not against
defunding the police
and then he doesn't see a need for
another coronavirus lockdown
who is he who is he because those three
things
just described trump right when you say
all these
trump doesn't support a ban on fracking
he doesn't support defunding the police
and he doesn't see a need for another
coronavirus
lockdown that's just trump
is our uh and he's not in favor of court
packing
like trump so
do we really think that biden is going
to be
uh you know aoc friendly
it's not looking like it unless he's
doing a whole trojan horse thing where
he's really going to be super
progressive if he gets elected
and lives um all right
so there's also uh let me call out in
the interest of fairness
you know i i spend a tremendous amount
of time debunking the fine people hoax
but there's a biden version of that in
other words
there's a hoax on the bite inside that's
as big
and it goes like this
that joe biden forced the firing of the
ukrainian prosecutor
because he was investigating burisma
and hunter biden as far as i can tell
that news is as fake or that story is as
fake as the find people hoax
i don't think there's any difference i
think they're both completely untrue and
demonstrably so
now what is missing from the ukrainian
prosecutor story
every time you see the debunk and
somebody says no that didn't happen
uh europe and other diplomats appraised
this
and that prosecutor was actually not
going against
any uh any uh
any bad guys what do you call it uh
corruption
uh and it's actually the opposite so he
was fired for not going after corruption
and not going after burisma he wasn't
fired for going after burisma
now everybody who makes that claim does
it without a source
so there is still a possibility that
there's no source for that
which does which i don't know what i'd
do with that but why is it nobody ever
shows a source
i think they showed one source to one
polit uh
one uh diplomat who agreed with firing
this guy
but i would say preliminarily that it is
very unlikely
that the the most prominent claim that
you'll see on fox news about
biden is very unlikely that that's true
i would call that fake news now
i don't know you know where that ranks
in terms of the
fake news uh list of worstness but it's
pretty bad
if it's fake news and it looks like it
to me so
if you're if you're assuming that's true
maybe maybe lower your confidence that
that was really
happening now apparently biden was not
even asked about
hunter biden's emails the biggest story
on the right
completely ignored and wasn't even asked
what does that tell you i mean we're
definitely in a world where
uh the human voting is irrelevant it's
just
you know who gets hypnotized better so
if
if the mainstream media has more people
watching it
that's who wins the election that's it
politico is trying to say that the
hunter
emails uh are may not be real and that
they might be a russian plot
a russian mischief it might be a russian
plot
to give disinformation to rudy
because he would then give it to trump
so that's politico trying to turn this
into a non-story
but if those emails are real
they're real well was that the narrator
i think i heard the narrator so if it
turns out that hunter biden's emails are
real
they're real um
then the most problem the biggest
problem in there i don't want to say
problematic i hate that word
is that one of the emails says that he
has been required to give 50
of his income to pop what
if that's real if it's true that hunter
biden is saying to his other family
members
i think that's who he was talking to
that he's been giving 50
of his income to pop for a while what
would that tell you
is happening what that would tell me
is that joe biden has found a way to
legally make lots of money
swamply which is to have hunter biden do
a whole bunch of stuff which
individually is legal was it legal for
hunter biden
to accept a board position with barisma
yup it was legal was it legal for
burisma
to pay him way more than people think
he's worth
yeah totally legal would it be legal for
hunter biden to make a whole bunch of
money
in these totally legal ways and then
share
half of it with another family member
yes that would be legal it's all legal
so the indication is
that joe biden found a way to
basically be a gigantic criminal and
monetize his office
completely legally
and all the evidence that we have this
email
plus his lifestyle that doesn't match
you know what we imagine is his real
income
and and it's looking a whole
lot like the biden uh operation was a
lot like
you know the the clinton uh foundation
meaning completely legal but maybe it
shouldn't have been
so democrats seem to be really good at
finding legal ways to monetize
their elected positions and
we don't know for sure what's true at
this point but it looks exactly like
that
and and if the biden family is not
denying
the emails are real and here's the trick
if if the bidens deny the emails are
real
they will be caught in a lie because
it's almost a guarantee that we'll find
out some of them are real
there's probably ways you can find out
they're real or not so they know they
can't go with the direct lie
because they'll be uncovered later later
so they're going to have to
just pretend it doesn't exist and see if
they can make
half of the country never hear about the
story
and they're succeeding they're actually
succeeding
in figuring out how to just completely
keep the news from half of the country
and that's all they need they only need
half the country and then he's president
they don't need the other half as
as trump taught us so
this is just an amazing story it does
look like a smoking gun
it does look like the bidens are
completely corrupt
if this is if this evidence is true
still have to put that if on there
and it looks like they got caught
that's what it looks like so
let's talk about the twitter policy so
i want to compliment jack dorsey for
some of his communication on this
and uh
and what i'm complimenting is that i
like that jack
starts in two different tweets in which
he starts by just saying
they made a mistake that is very
disarming
and very good technique because if if
everybody's blaming you for doing
something
and the very first thing out of you out
of your mouth is total mistake
what do you do after that you know
that's your complaint
your complaint is i need you to hear
that you made a mistake
and then the person you're complaining
to says quote
first first sentence out of them is our
communication around our actions on the
new york post article
was not great that's that's a direct
statement
of of a problem and i appreciate that
and then likewise uh when he followed up
and i think this might have been
yesterday
his first sentence and this tweet was
straight blocking of urls was wrong
that's it straight blocking of urls was
wrong
period that that's all you need to say
now who does this remind you of
who who can you think of who once had a
corporate um controversy
who solved it the same way with a simple
direct statement
of which the very first statement
acknowledged the problem
steve jobs steve jobs and antennagate
steve jobs and antennagate showed us the
the
gold standard for handling this kind of
an issue
you first say directly and cleanly
this is a mistake and then you say you
want to make people happy
and you say what you're going to do
about it that's the formula
it was a flat mistake sorry about that
here's what we're going to do about it
and that's
the that's the model that jack took now
you could argue that you don't like his
solution and we'll talk about that in a
minute
but in terms of the method of
communication the persuasion of it
he hit the he hit the forum just right
and i appreciated that now let's talk
about the actual solution
so apparently the the new changes are
that
they will no longer remove hacked
content
unless it comes directly from the
hackers or from somebody working with
them
you know directly but apparently if it
goes through a news source
or some other individual who's not part
of the hacking
then it will still be there now does
this apply
to the new york post story well this is
a gray area
because there is no claim of hacking
right but you could argue that somehow
they got into the hard drive if getting
into the hard drive
of somebody who did not want you to get
into their hard drive presumably
you have to assume nobody wants you to
get into their hard drive
would you call that hacking would you
say that the
store owner who had a legal right to the
computer
would you say that he hacked i would say
yes
that feels like hacking isn't it if you
if you get into the data of somebody's
hard drive
and they didn't want you to do it and
obviously nobody wants that
that's kind of hacking i i've heard
people say they're they think of it in
terms of
remote hacking you know over the
internet it wasn't that
or you know politico thinks maybe it
might have been might have been some
russian plot but i i think
i would call it a hacking and
even though he had a legal right to do
it in that case
uh so that's a good change so what do
what do you think of that
that twitter policy that's pretty good
wouldn't you say
i feel like you know insofar as you're
talking about hacked material
they now have a consistent policy that i
think
could work so that part's good um
but it sounds sounds like they were
still not going to run the new york post
story at least twitter is resisting
those tweets
because it was personal so it was by
hunter biden's personal information
and that's different than say political
information
so if i interpret the twitter policy
correctly
if it had been the subject of a hacking
and
it came into the news not through the
hackers themselves directly
but it was about politics then that
would still be fine
but since it's about his personal life
twitter is making a call that that's
you know not not appropriate apparently
but that's a gray area again because
hunter biden's
personal information on that hard drive
looks like it was very much connected to
his father and very much connected to
politics
if if it's true so
it's it's it's sort of impossible for
the social media companies to have a
standard that just works all the time
so their other standard of course is
that they're going to put a warning
label on things that are
fake and known to be inaccurate
and so i did a little test by doing a
tweet
that says that the find people hoax is a
hoax
and if it doesn't get a warning label it
would mean that
at least according to twitter it is a
non-controversial statement
to say that it's a hoax so i'm going to
say
i i assume because i've said it a
million times before
i'm assuming it will not get any kind of
label but that should tell you something
right
if twitter fact checkers believed it was
untrue would it not be subject to at
least a label that says uh
i'd take a look at this source over here
if you think that's true
i think they would be within the right
to do that according to their policy
if they thought it wasn't true all right
so we'll see about that
did you see the story that the former
mexican defense
secretary got arrested for drug
trafficking
what this is the guy who is the head of
the military in mexico
until 2018 from 2012 to 2018
not very long time ago 2018
the head of the mexican military
at least in 2020 he was arrested for
drug trafficking and money laundering
so they got him in los angeles does that
indicate that maybe
the mexican military was in the pocket
of the cartels
back in 2018 yeah
obviously obviously
all right um another big story
is that president trump retweeted a
babylon bee
tweet now babylon b of course is a
satirical site like the onion
and the way trump uh dealt with the
retweet
people are left believing that he
thought the story was a real one
the the the claim in the babylon bees
satire
was that uh twitter shut down all of
the internet or something to prevent
people from hearing bad stuff about
biden
now of course that didn't happen
but what might have happened i i still
haven't heard what the problem was with
twitter's
network i think they had an early
statement that they didn't think it was
hacking
but i wonder if it was the power
problems in california so i don't know
where
twitter's physical resources are
i don't know where all of their you know
data centers are i don't know where
their technical people live exactly
but we had massive power outages in
california at about the same time that
twitter was having its outage
are they related because
it could be that california's power
outages
knocked twitter out and it wouldn't have
to necessarily knock out their
data center they might have you know
backup power at the data center
but suppose there was a bug in the
system
and the only person who could fix it or
the people who need to talk to each
other to fix
it had a power problem and they just
couldn't get in and they couldn't do
what they needed to do to fix it
i'm just speculating i don't know
anything about what caused the problem
but it i don't know if it's a
coincidence that california lost
power and a california company lost its
network at the same time
so waiting to hear about that
um
apparently trump is losing to biden
among women
at a rate of 60 60 percent to 34.
so trump is just getting killed on women
voters
and women care about health care more so
you know there again
i i would reiterate trump's handling of
health care and handling of the pandemic
he deserves to lose he deserves to lose
about
the way he's handled that um and
i would say women control the country
now if
if biden wins it will be because women
wanted him to win
wouldn't you agree given that's that is
the big difference is the women voters
so it's going to feel as though
women are running the country because
they are
and they would be uh they would be the
deciding vote so you can take that as
uh any anything you like in terms of
good news or bad news
if you're a woman you probably think
it's good news uh
and if you're a man maybe maybe you
don't care maybe you just say oh it's
time for women to be in charge in fact i
would go so far as to say
in the same way that people used to say
that
bill clinton was the first black
president
i think joe biden might be the first
female president
because biden is so
favored by women and his policies do
seem to have a female
leaning bias to them good or bad i'm
just saying that
he does his policies are female friendly
he's sort of the first female president
you might say
in a good way not a bad way um
somebody says i hate to break it to you
but women love trump
well not according to the polls and i
would certainly believe
polls could be off by you know
five or six percent but the difference
the difference is 60 support to 34.
the polls are not off by that much there
is
clearly a gigantic difference in how
women
see trump in elementary and he's earned
that
i mean you know he knows what it takes
to
be attractive to women and what it
doesn't take
somebody says scott needs to get laid
you are apparently not up to date on
on my life um
in the comments somebody in the comments
is saying women destroy civilization
well i wouldn't say that i would go
exactly the opposite and i would say
that women
are the the primary source of
civilization
meaning that civilization takes form to
protect
the the reproductive process in other
words a
human's greatest interest is
reproduction just like everybody else's
biological imperative and so
it makes sense the society would evolve
over time
to favor anything that allows you know
women to be
safe when they're having kids so it
makes sense that
that society is largely a female
invention
for the benefit of men as well i'm not
saying it's only for women
all right so we have two people running
for president who in my opinion
both deserve to lose biden for being
generally incompetent
and disrespecting the voters and not
even telling us
his opinion and being generally too old
and lame to do the job
and trump because of his handling of
health care and coronavirus
is disqualifying i think so
i'm being asked on youtube if i'm high
right now
no i'm not sorry you probably wish i
would
you probably wish i were all right
that's it for now i'll talk to you
later
