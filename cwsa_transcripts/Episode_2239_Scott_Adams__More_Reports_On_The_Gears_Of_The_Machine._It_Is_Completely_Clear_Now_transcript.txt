do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
and if you'd like your experience to be
so special that you'll be talking to
your grandkids about it forever all you
need is a copper micro glass to take
your Chelsea's Diana canteen jug or
flaska vessel Liberty kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's a dope immediate of the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
ah
so good favorite
all right well let's talk about all the
news
Governor Newsom
was complaining recently that he that
there are a lot of micro cults
and he gave some examples and he said
that his own son
has been talking to him about Andrew
Tate
Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson
I guess those are the micro occults
that's right governor newsom's
son
is listening to Tate Rogan and Jordan
Peterson
so what can you conclude from that
here's what I conclude from that
I'm just going to guess
that that son has a very clean bedroom
yeah anybody anybody want to take the
other side of that bat
wouldn't you love to ask him that
question
just one question and walk away
I'll govern to do something I hear your
sons you know listening to uh you know
Tate and Rogan and Jordan Peterson well
yes I'm I'm afraid to say it's true I
just have one question
how clean is this bedroom
and though you don't even wait for the
answer just walk away
that's how I play it
well I have a theory that there will be
a rebalance of our current crazy
situation
uh
and the reason that the reason for the
rebalance is that men adult men
have been completely taken out of the
let's say the political conversation
because we're too easy to cancel and to
threaten
so men need jobs
and if you say the wrong things in
America you lose your job
so men are just completely taken off the
board because we'll just get canceled
like Russell Brand or Dr Carlson or me
so so adult men don't have any any hope
of being part of the conversation in a
meaningful way
this however will be very different with
young men who have nothing to lose
and even when they don't have anything
to lose
they're more likely to risk losing it
because they're young men
I don't know if you've been paying
attention but the young males are not on
board with wokeness
and I don't think that's an exaggeration
the young men not on board with walkness
not even a little bit
I've never even met one
never even met a young male
who was woke never even heard of one
and those men
have nothing to lose
because they don't have jobs
they have nothing to lose
so you're going to see this explosion of
male energy
that has been suppressed in the adult
male population for a long time because
you know why we thought we could protect
our jobs
how'd that work out
did it work out at all yeah no because
your job will be taken by a diversity
hire anyway yeah so you know a woman
will take your job or lgbtq so going
along with the plan doesn't help as much
as you think you would but it's a
natural impulse
so look out we might be a generation
away from it but uh
now that I know that Governor newsom's
son is being raised by Andrew Tate
I'm just going to say there are some
prizes a few surprises coming
that's all
all right in uh the segment I like to
call dumb science
where science gives you a result that
you don't have to be an expert to know
his
okay so the the test here is without
being any kind of a scientist at all
can you tell that this is so
let me tell you what they found
uh there was a study that found out that
the events of January 6 caused a
substantial
um degrade degradation in mental health
so there's a big drop in mental health
but it doesn't seem to be across the
board
it seems to have hit Democrats really
hard
but Republicans sort of not at all
so January 6 actually caused measurable
mental health decline for Democrats
but no real no real difference for
republicans
and so do you know what they concluded
based on this
their conclusion was that the events of
January 6
caused a decline in mental health
does that sound accurate the events of
January 6 caused a decline in mental
health
let me uh postulate another possibility
could it be that the reason Democrats
were affected is that they watched fake
news
and the Republicans watched both so they
could judge what was real and what was
fake pretty easily and that the people
who saw the real news
did not think that there was a an
Insurrection that almost destroyed the
country
or anything like that
and so the Republicans had reason to be
angry you know politically angry
but they didn't have any trigger to be
politically mentally you know unhealthy
but the Democrats did
that they were told non-stop that their
country was almost lost and they live in
a white supremacist society that almost
took over
that would be pretty scary
to imagine if something like that
actually happened in the real world
but it didn't it's just that their
neighbors told them it did and it made
them crazy
now getting back to Dr Jordan Peterson's
theory that a lot of what you see online
is the dark Triad personality traits
narcissists mostly
and that you're mostly just saying
Mental Health
Amplified
you know before if you had bad note to
health it only bothered a few people
that you associated with but now bad
mental health is like ah I can scream it
on social media I can cancel you I
control you
I just thought that control
and Ken troll
are very similar aren't they
because they use trolls to control
if you control you control interesting
that's a dumb science for today dumb
science
a question I like to ask every few
months just to get people talking
why in the world would anybody hire
someone who had pronouns in any of their
bios
online or otherwise why would you do
that
now
I imagine there'd be some like super
blue businesses that just you know have
to give somebody just like them there'd
be some of those
but doesn't doesn't the pronoun signal
that you're going to cause trouble
I don't know how it could be more clear
hi I'm going to have a problem on this
minor point and I not only am I going to
have a problem I want to tell you in
advance
so when you violate this minor Point
whoa
there's going to be trouble why would
anybody hire somebody who led with how
much trouble they're going to be
now my assumption is that the pronoun
thing will go away and I think it will
go away
because the number of companies that
will hire you because you have a pronoun
will drop to zero
but the number that will reject you
because the pronouns is probably already
at a third maybe 30 or more
I would think what's your guess what
what percentage of hiring managers
across across the board everywhere
would reject somebody just immediately
because of her pronoun I would I would I
would not even consider somebody with
their pronoun
it has nothing to do with their
political opinions
it's really really bad judgment to put
your pronoun in your bio if you're
applying for a job because you don't
know yet if your employer thinks that's
cool
so that I mean it's a big signal a bad
judgment but it's also a signal of
potential lawsuits and trouble like that
and also somebody who's going to support
every woke person and woke thing and you
don't need that either
so my guess is that pure economics will
drive this out in the marketplace
just economics
what do you think
do you think there'll be more of it or
is it just sort of obvious that
economics will drive it out of the
system
I think we're just a few years away from
disappearing maybe three I think in the
three years pronouns will make you look
like just a idiot
yeah all right
uh I've said this story before but I
like it so much I'm going to say it
again so Ibrahim Kennedy the anti-racist
guy activist
um he's trying to figure out what
happened to 30 million dollars of
mismanaged money for his quote
anti-racism Center
so Boston University is investigating in
the center following allegations that he
mismanaged Grant funds failed to deliver
key projects and Unleashed employment
violence of the staff
now guess what type of people he hired
he hired the kind of people who would
have pronouns in their bio
how'd that work out
well it looks like it looks like they
have some complaints
yeah they have some complaints
now there might be a really good reason
for a complaint because it's missing 30
million dollars and the other the other
accusations you have to take seriously
but
even if Kennedy had done nothing wrong
but the only thing he'd done is hired a
staff full of complainers
how in the world was that going to work
so so we've actually seen the the test
case of hiring people not from Merit but
for like you know being like-minded
didn't work out turns out big surprise
didn't work out
all right here's something I'll bet you
didn't know
uh Mike Benz uh taught me this on
Twitter on accident
um
did you know
that in Cuba the the CIA tried to create
a a twitter-like product that the CIA
would control and unknowingly the Cuban
population would use it not knowing that
the CIA controlled it and the plan
explicitly was to build up a population
of users and then after they got the
population of users they would
politicize it in other words they'd put
their finger on it and start using it to
foment Revolution
well it didn't work out because they
didn't get enough users and they didn't
get their funding so it never got to the
second step of fomenting protests fake
protests they were fomented by the CIA
so this was literally a way that was
being used to overthrow Cuba
unsuccessfully
but you could tell that the CIA
and by the way this is documented it's
on it's on Wikipedia it's not one of
these weird
conspiracy theories it's just it's well
documented thing
now
you don't think that China thought of
that with tick tock
you don't think that China
said let's build up an audience and once
we've got a good audience
then we're going to turn the crank a
little bit
no because it turns out that the news is
also reporting that Tick Tock is moving
more into Political content
big surprise there's more political
content now on Tick Tock huh I wonder if
it's mostly conservative
is not what it mostly is terrible woke
things that would destroy the country oh
big surprise big surprise is that lots
of things that would reduce the odds of
reproduction oh yeah it is oh yeah it is
but it's a complete coincidence right
it's just a coincidence it's a
coincidence that rcia tried to do an OP
that looks exactly like tick tock
that's just a coincidence
so now China's not up to anything and
the way we know that China is not up to
anything is a Rand Paul
um squashed the effort to block
Tick-Tock downloads in Congress
Rand Paul Rand Paul who is one of his
biggest funders oh an owner of tick tock
yeah yeah one of an American billionaire
who owns a lot of tick tock
um is one of the biggest funders to the
people who stopped it from being banned
things are exactly the way they look
the gears of the machine
are becoming visible
how many of you have a completely
different understanding of our system
just the last several months from
listening to me
it's nothing like what you thought it
was is it yeah it's kind of mind-blowing
isn't it when you you can see the whole
system
all right let's talk about uh
Dave Portnoy as you probably already
know uh a food writer that's right a
food editor
decided to write a story about him
having a pizza Festival which was for
the benefit of the small businesses
and they decided to call the sponsors
for the event and say are you
comfortable working with this misogynist
who does sketchy things
which obviously
is intended to destroy his economic
model
now pardon a Portnoy uh being a media
I would say expert
knew exactly how to handle this and
recorded his phone call when he called
the reporter for the Washington Post and
basically embarrassed that reporter or
made it a national story which was
perfect
you know you you can't handle it better
than that that was perfect
now do you see the gears of the machine
The Washington Post
who by the way do you know the
Washington Post is probably the biggest
entity that canceled me
did you know that because you heard that
I was canceled in newspapers
but unless the Washington Post goes
first the other ones aren't going to do
it
so they were the they were the big voice
yeah
so just keep that in mind
I wonder if there are any other stories
that would be relevant to this one in a
different way
well let's go back to 2013.
here's something you didn't know in 2013
um
Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post
so that the guy who owns Amazon richest
guy in the world at the time
bought the Washington Post a lot of
people didn't think that was a good
investment because it didn't look like
it could make money it's like why would
you even do that it's kind of a weird
investment
seems like the last thing you'd invest
in but he did
that was 2013.
some people say that the Washington Post
is the outlet that the CIA likes to use
to put their preferred news into the
reporters
that's what they say I mean I can't
confirm that that's what smart people
say
I wonder if anything else happened in
2013
2013 the same year that Jeff Bezos
bought the Washington Post oh yeah oh
yeah so here's the story
um
um the CIA actually needs a lot of
processors
so they're using it in 2013
they made a 600 million dollar deal with
uh Amazon web service
so the CIA has a 600 million dollar deal
it happened oh the same year same year
that Bezos rescued the newspaper that
some say
is the CIA newspaper
so Jeff Bezos rescued the CIA newspaper
some say
the same year that the CIA decided to
give their gigantic deal
to Amazon
but that's a coincidence
the things happen in the same year
that's just a coincidence
so now we have a situation where the
news is so owned
that Biden can say absolutely anything
and be confident that his audience won't
hear any Counterpoint
no matter what it is this is something
Biden actually said in an event
yesterday that Mega Republicans spend
four years gutting the immigration
system under my predecessor
they continue to undermine our border
security today
just hold that in your mind
the Democrats are so cut off from actual
news
that Biden can tell them that the Border
problem was Trump's fault
and they might actually believe it
just think about that
that's where we are in 2023
. it's almost too hard to hold in your
mind isn't it you almost can't keep that
in your mind it's like really
really Biden said that the Border
problem is was Trump's fault
but if if you uh if you didn't have
access to real news
would you believe it
probably
you probably would believe it yeah
um Dave Rubin
says on some Expos that he's been
demonetized a few times Lately by
YouTube
and um are you surprised
let's see Dave Rubin getting demonetized
Andrew Teddy monetized Jordan Peterson
and his license is being threatened and
Joe Rogan they tried to cancel him I was
completely canceled Dave Portnoy they're
going after his business model
do you see any patterns yet
musk going after Elon Musk yeah do you
see the pattern
yep there's a pattern
so
um
what else is happening
uh
let's talk about Twitter apparently a
group called America First legal is
suing Biden's FTC
for what they say is illegally
concealing documents on government
targeting of Elon musk's Musk and X
because a report by the house
weaponization committee concluded that
the FTC
inappropriately stretched its regulatory
power to harass what was then Twitter
so we might actually have documents to
show that the FTC
was going after musk for political
reasons
total weaponization of the government
um would you like to know how the
original Twitter boycott was organized
so and musk said he was going to take
over Twitter
can you imagine the amount of panic
in the Democrats who had figured out a
way to control most of the other sources
of news but if they couldn't control
Twitter
then they can't keep this keep the lid
on
so here's something I learned there's a
a group called Arabella advisors
and they somehow bankrolled 26 ngos
who then organized a Twitter boycott
so the ngos probably wouldn't have done
this without the Arabella advisors
bankrolling them
so don't you wonder who they are who are
these Arabella advisors
have you ever heard of them
because because they had a really big
impact on your life if you were in
social media but have you ever Arabella
advisors
uh let's see I wonder who's on the board
of Arabella advisors
oh Sam bankman Freed's the father
Sam bankman free it's the uh the crypto
scam guy who was the biggest donor to
the Democrats
yeah
so Sam bankman Freed's father was on the
Arabella advisors board
and they bankrolled the ngos to organize
a boycott
so that you would probably think that it
wasn't organized because it was coming
from lots of different directions
um and where do they get their money
Soros Soros democracy Alliance
yeah so the Soros democracy Alliance
gives money to the Arabella advisors and
then Sam bankman Freed's dad being on
the board
and others give it to these ngos
which are created specifically to look
like there are independent organizations
that coincidentally have the same
opinion
well there's so many organizations these
non-government organizations they're not
even part of the government we're the
government we're just listening to the
the citizens as they express themselves
through the non-government organizations
well there are 26 of them I mean if 26
non-government organizations all have
the same opinion well that's pretty
important so you better listen to it
because there are 26 of them I mean you
don't get 26 non-government
organizations suddenly all of a sudden
on the same page
unless they're all paid by the same
person
in which case it's pretty easy
um so how many big organizations do you
believe have Dei organizations within
their organization what percent of
big entities that would include
newspapers Publishers social media all
of them
the big ones are close to 100 I think
you know at least 90 right
so now do you see how the machine works
so let's say that Washington Post for
example
let's say the Washington Post does a
story and says somebody's bad
did that story necessarily start with
the writers at the Washington Post or
did the idea for the story maybe come
from another source
such as the CIA
or such as Democrat Democrats operatives
which are very similar because the CIA
and the Democrats seem pretty
overlapping
so if this is the model you can imagine
that somebody a Democrat asked the
Washington Post to crap on somebody so
the Washington Post writes they hit
piece on them and then every Dei
organization in every organization says
whoa whoa we have to act on this
do you know why they say they have to
act
because if you hire a Dei group they're
going to have to get involved in
everything that looks like their
business
and do you think they're going to say oh
that's fine let it roll yeah it's just
the Washington Post don't believe
anything they say do you think that
happens no the Dei people will say you
have to cancel whoever they're talking
about
you have to do it now so as long as
there's
Democrat influence on the big
Publications the big Publications can
talk to the public the Dei groups within
big entities will say oh that's for me I
better act quickly and I'm the tale that
Wags the dog because you don't want to
get on my bad side I'm the DI person
believe me you might be the CEO
but I'm the one who can ruin you
so I I'm kind of the real power when it
comes to things I care about not all
things in the company but the things I
care about
the d e i p person is the real power
so now the Democrats have a model where
they can cancel anybody
because they have the the signal that
can send out the bad signal Washington
Post Phil bump says whatever
and then the Dei people without without
being asked to do it they would just
know that that's what they do they
activate all the sources of money
so that anybody who disagrees with them
loses their money
immediately
now when you lose your money you also
lose your influence usually
because you can't you can't build your
own network you can't hire people you
can't advertise you can't put in a book
you can't do anything
so it just reduces your impact in the in
the intelligence world it's called
reducing your capacity
so the the fact that there's this
network and structure of ngos and Dei
and all that that would increase the
capacity of the Democrats and then they
would uh they would go after the
economic assets of their enemies
like me and then when we were we're
pressed down by our economic situation
then their message can can rule
I I think they they largely took um Fox
News completely out of the game
I I think Fox News is just completely
neutered at this point what do you think
so
and try to do a try to do a social media
search for Breitbart
do you know how hard it is to find
Breitbart on a search engine it's not an
accident
right so the the largest entities have
been economically suppressed to the
point where Biden can say that
immigration is Trump's fault
amazingly they can tell you that January
6 was an attempt to overthrow the
country
at half of the country will think that
actually happened
they can tell you anything
and that's the country their half will
think it actually happened
super beats stop it
I'm not talking about superbeets
that's funny
all right um
now let me uh let's talk about climate
models
um I saw somebody tweet to show me that
climate models have in fact been
successful and not only have the climate
models successfully predicted but
they've been doing it for 50 years
there are climate models that are 50
years old
that have accurately predicted today's
temperature
isn't that amazing
yeah would you like to would you like me
to understand how the science works
yeah here's how science works
if somebody does some science
and then they hand it off to somebody
who's a big liar or doesn't know
how to do statistics
and then they do a bunch of lying and
bad statistics and then the people who
are fooled by this say hey you're going
to have to believe this and bad
statistics and ridiculous data because
if you don't you're anti-science and
I've got somebody who's going to cancel
you
so let me see if you can find out that
this will be a test to see if I've
taught you anything
if I tell you anything
so here's the claim
that there were a number of models in
the old days 50 years ago that tried to
predict the temperature
some of them didn't work
so they were discarded
others also didn't work but they found
that if they tweaked it a little bit
they could they could get it to Back
cast you know they it could get it to
match the past a little bit and then
they would see if it also matches the
future
so there's a little bit of tweaking
to make sure that as you go you're
maximizing your you know of course you'd
like to fix it as you go right so when
you're done you find that there were a
number of models
that actually did predict the
temperature
so that means models work right go
models work because they have models
that predicted the temperature how can
you argue with that they're the models I
can show you they can show you that they
existed 50 years ago and they can show
you got the right answer
do you all see what's wrong yeah okay
there's a Brian got the word I was
looking for survivorship bias
if you throw away the models that don't
work
that's not science
that's like the opposite of science if
you throw away the models that don't
work it gives you the impression that
somehow you knew you could have known
that these models work and the other
ones don't if you don't know it when the
models are created which ones are the
good ones
you can't wait until some of them got
lucky and say these were accurate the
whole time
that's not science
that's the scam
not only is it a scam
it's literally a scam
actual scams are done that way
and I've described this before so I'll
just do it fast one of the ways you
could do a scam is I'll send you an
email and you'll get the email and it'll
say if you buy this stock today I
guarantee it'll go up and you're like ah
nobody can predict stocks so you ignore
it next day they say it went up
and here's another one the next one I
picked to go up is this one that you're
like I got lucky once and then the next
you know next few days you get another
email two in a row you can check for
yourself you can look at your first
email sure enough you recommended these
stocks then you can look at what the
actual price is and sure enough
the two stocks that this stranger picked
and wants you to invest with them they
both went up two for two
then they do it a third time
three in a row and they don't just go up
they go up quite a bit
if you see three in a row where they
call the shot before the shot
you're pretty convinced because three
out of three is kind of hard if it goes
up substantially that's really hard so
you give them your money
and then it turns out to be a scam how
did they get three in a row
here's how
they wrote lots of emails to lots of
people and they gave different
recommendations to the people
most of them were wrong so they never
email that group again because that
group doesn't trust them but some of
them were right because they got lucky
it's just a subset they got lucky
so now they say just to the lucky people
here's my new my new recommendation but
again they don't give them one
recommendation they give even the new
smaller group a bunch of new
recommendations again a few of them end
up with two in a row just luck
and and then they repeat and then
there's even a smaller group they get
three in a row right they throw their
money at you they throw their money at
you
because once you see three in a row
you're like okay this is real
and then you find out it was always just
random
that's what the climate models are
if they're tweaking the models as they
go
of course you can tweak it until it
matches the current situation and the
past of course you can you can tweak any
model until it hindcasts correctly you
just change your assumptions until it
does that doesn't mean it predicts
it just means you can tweak it until it
matches the past
and if you throw away enough models and
there are enough different ones some of
them are a hundred percent likely to be
closer than others
and some of them might be real close and
then you say well these are good models
now
the real test is to take any one of
those models that worked over the last
50 years never change them again don't
touch them
see how they do for the next 50. do you
think they're going to do the next 50
because they did the last 50. no do you
know why nobody can predict the future
there's no such thing as a model that
predicts the future
in very narrow circumstances sometimes
an economic model will be useful
but I did economic models for a living
right that was my background economics
business and I would do Financial
projections for big companies
and
the the one thing we all knew is you
couldn't predict more than six months
and after that everything just goes you
know polywampus
so we had we had no uh beliefs that we
could actually predict the things we
were predicting but you can sometimes
tell what is the range of possibilities
so that that's really all you can get
out of a financial prediction it's sort
of a range well it's not going to be way
up here and probably it's not going to
be way down here but it might be in this
cone somewhere and that could be useful
but usually we just did things we
thought we wanted to do and then made
the numbers correspond to what we'd
already decided like everywhere
just like everywhere if you think that
the climate change people are the only
ones who are not tweaking the model to
make it do whatever they want but every
other industry is
right every other industry is I
guarantee that but not these guys it's
the one place oh the one place where the
people who make models that predict the
future are actually doing it they can do
magic they can see the future no nobody
can see the future
you don't know what's going to be
invented tomorrow I mean the other day I
saw there was some
some new Battery Technology maybe with
aluminum I think it was aluminum instead
of
state of the current Battery Technology
it was supposed to be lighter and more
dense and better in every way well which
which climate model predicted that
all right
so yeah instead of lithium
right so yes climate models or BS and
always will be
well there's a shocking new data on a
study that says the uh
the Mexican organized crime groups are
the fifth largest employer in the
country and there are 175 000 members in
organized crime in Mexico
so
now
obviously
uh if the cartels are getting bigger
what can we conclude for sure
well we can conclude that for reasons
that are mysterious
the cartels are the only thing that the
CIA can't shut down
they can overthrow entire countries
but they can't shut down the cartels
they just get bigger every year huh what
could possibly explain that
could it be that the cartels also
protect some things that the CIA wants
protected
such as maybe some businesses in Mexico
that would rather have the cartels
protect them than attack them
Maybe
maybe the CIA would like that to happen
because you know they're on the side of
business
I don't know I don't know what's going
on there I'm just saying that uh
there there's a big mystery about why
we're ineffective in this one area
and I can't think of any reason we'd be
this ineffective including keeping the
Border open as it is unless we wanted to
unless we wanted to
so
there's that
um
I did see that
at least somebody's making a run at the
fact that
this is in the Wall Street Journal so
not a not a left-leaning publication so
this is the Wall Street Journal which is
what made it notable and the Wall Street
Journal says that the immigration is
already good for the economy
like this Mass over immigration
is already a plus for the economy do you
believe that
the argument is that it we were so
hurting for labor
when I say we certain businesses
Industries they were so hurting for
labor that it's basically a lifeline the
immigration is the only way they can
stay in business
and that
um you know the immigrants are adding a
certain amount of economic activity that
pays for them to be there and we don't
make enough babies
so our economy would be in serious
trouble
because we don't make babies and the
only way we could survive is massive
immigration
now I don't think that explains why
we're seeing it
do you because if you were doing it for
um for the purpose of your economy
the way you would launder that opinion
is you'd have some you know Board of
Economics experts
and then they would tell you what kind
of people to allow in you know what
skills we need and how many and maybe
from where I don't know but if you were
trying to make this an economic policy
you know explicitly hey this is good for
the country because we're not making
enough babies
you would do it differently
you wouldn't do it by pretending you're
doing border security but doing it
poorly
that's just not the way you'd approach
it you would do it right out front
because there's nothing to hide
you had you would have nothing to hide
if you made the argument we need more
people
and we don't have another way to get
them in fact I think I could be
persuaded by that argument because I've
made the same argument
I've made the same argument that as
disruptive as immigration is now and
it's plenty disruptive
probably is additive
in the long run it might take 10 years
but
let me say it this way if we shut the
border completely today
and all we did is work through the
system the people have already come in
I'm pretty sure we'd come out ahead
because people are money
in our country when there are plenty of
jobs because we don't have a shortage of
jobs so if you have jobs
you just add people
that's that's the whole economy jobs
exist not enough people add some people
boom problem solved so in all likelihood
as horrible as our current system of
bringing people in and and of course
they're bringing in crime and there must
be terrorists and everything else in
these groups so you know the terrorists
of the crimes and all that have to be
netted out but even with that net
probably it's probably cash positive
not right away though you know in the in
the uh
in the short term
cash negative for sure
well yeah I see what you're saying it
depends what part of the country they
come from and I think that's where
that's where
I'm sure this is not intentional for
economic reasons so the fact that the
immigration is coming from everywhere
is strongly suggestive that the
government is not in control of the
process
and there might be some net positive
that comes from it but it doesn't look
intentional
it looks like there's some other reason
for the immigration that's not stated
uh my best guess is that the cartels
want it because it's good for the cartel
business and that we either have too
many people working with them or afraid
of them or bribed by them or blackmailed
by them that the US government doesn't
have any power over them which would
suggest that the cartels have power over
the United States
let me put it a different way there's no
way in hell there's somebody who lives
inside the United States
is behind the mass immigration
I don't see it
I just don't see it
um and if you think Soros is behind it
you're going to have to ask the second
question to who's behind Soros
and
all signs point to the same the same
entity I don't know
but they all point to the same place
all right uh you'll be amazed that
Ukraine has has breached the main
Russian defensive line in the southeast
of the country and their armored
vehicles have gone through it's a
significant milestone for the three and
a half month counter-offensive and it
looks like they're aimed at cutting the
Russians occupying Army in two
because that's totally true
does anybody believe that the ukrainians
have a substantial breakthrough
yeah
it seems far more likely that the
Russians have created a weak spot
so that they would break through so that
they just enter a kill box and then when
we're done killing them they'll show it
back up again
to me it looks like a trick
because apparently they are taking heavy
losses so even though they got humans on
the other side of the line most of the
humans are not in mechanical Vehicles
anymore because they all got they all
got whacked
so so the news was trying to make it
look like it was a plus for Ukraine
that although they they tried to come
across in their armored vehicles the
armored vehicles were largely taken out
but the people inside lived in many
cases so the humans you know made it
across the line
what would be less good for the
ukrainians than to have all of their
exposed humans who are their most
um most limited resource is the humans
they're running out of people so now the
people will be outside of armored
vehicles and and behind the lines of the
Russians
how long are they going to live
I mean every part of this looks like a
Russian trap to me is reported as a
Ukrainian success
but if they got their success and they
lost their mechanical
they lost their tanks and their armored
vehicles
and they're just running around with
guns on the other side
that doesn't look like a win that looks
like a kill box
I mean with my vast military experience
I say I'm just saying it doesn't look
like a win that's all I'll say
it doesn't look like a win
but I won't rule it out I mean
anything's possible you know maybe maybe
there will be a breakthrough at some
point don't know
but I would not bet any money on that
that ladies and gentlemen
is all I needed to talk about today did
I miss any big stories is there anything
I missed
and not every tank crewman has a gun but
they probably could
find one
uh Armenia
um
yeah I don't have a take on Armenia
do you think that Pence mentioning
troops is makes it likely we'll put
soldiers on the ground I can't see it
happening
so let me take the temperature
do you think we're going to have
soldiers on the ground in Ukraine
fighting Russians
I mean I assume we have some in secret
who are like advisors and stuff I I
don't see that any Administration could
survive that
I don't see it yeah
so you know what would be interesting if
Trump ran instead of running against
Biden let's say Biden is the actual
candidate but I always wondered what
would happen if he just said he was
running against the
the CIA or he was running against uh
you know some kind of machine
he's not really running against Biden
so
my uh my assumption
is that they tried to get rid of Biden
and it didn't work meaning that Biden
needed to keep his job
probably so he could cover his tracks
and make more money and keep Hunter out
of jail so I think that he was probably
pressured to leave and you know or to
not run and he decided that he was going
to be stubborn
so now it turns out they're going to
send Gavin Newsom to be the person on
the ground around the GOP debates so
that Gavin will be the counter message
they're very much keeping Gavin in the
news aren't they
have you noticed he's always in the news
just sort of hanging around
so it does look the people the people
who say they're going to wait till last
minute and Slot them in there without a
convention you know maybe even wait
until after the convention and then
Newton then Biden steps down and they
slip him in so bad at the last minute
very much could happen
but here's what I think
I think that
Biden doesn't want that to happen
because I think he actually wants to win
again and I think that uh the Democrats
are just keeping them around you know
Governor under glass breaking case of
emergency
but that's the best I can do
so I think it's going to be a hilarious
race
and watching Biden decompose and
watching Democrats explain that it's not
so bad
it's going to be funny
and watching you know fetterman and
Feinstein and Biden and Harris try to
speak and walk and and act is going to
be hilarious
there's a lot that's just funny at this
point
um
I assure gruesome nuisance the man well
I'm sure he's the one that's chosen
so let's talk about uh Michelle Obama
because
um
who was it Ted Cruz he said that he
believes Biden will not be the 2024
nominee and that they will parachute in
Michelle Obama
how many of you think that Michelle
Obama will be the replacement
I'm going to put that at zero
it's weird to hear Ted Cruz suggest it
because there are a lot of things I
would say well that's a 10 chance or 20
she has I'm pretty sure that's zero
how could they possibly win
putting in somebody that they would even
pretend disqualified
that's not even pretending I mean even
Democrats would understand uh she was
the spouse
at least Hillary had the
you know she had the experience of you
know government before she ran for
president
now I don't think there's any chance but
the funniest comment I saw from somebody
on X is that uh
uh the reason the reason that is that
that Michelle Obama will come out as
trans and quote that's why we have been
softened up
so one person's Theory I don't buy this
Theory all right so this is not me I
just thought it was a funny funny that
somebody has this theory that the whole
uh trans conversation has been a way to
soften the country's binds up so they
can drop in Michelle Obama
she'll come public as trans
and then become president and he'll have
our first trans person
that we know of
I don't think that's going to happen and
I don't think that the country has been
softened up for this possibility and I
don't think she's a man I don't think
she's a man I'm not 100 sure
well let me let me put this in that in a
better comparison I'm a hundred percent
sure she's not going to run for
president
I'm not 100 sure she's a woman
I'm 95 sure
95 percent
but not 100
but you know I'm not sure I would say
anything different about most of you
if I met you in person would I be 100
sure of your gender
100
I don't know depend who I'm talking to
well do you do you buy the uh idea that
the young men
who are coming up or going to reject
wokeness and change things
I heard from quite a few people who say
oh yeah that's my kids
now let me tell you what I've heard a
lot of times and then I'll tell you what
I've heard zero times
I've heard a lot of reports of kids
hating wokeness in all its all of its
forms
I've heard zero stories of somebody in
school
who was pushing wokeness
none not once now I'm not talking about
inclusivity because that is pushed you
know to make sure that everybody's
included and stuff that's definitely
pushed but that's not a bad impulse and
that's not even political
but you know the true woke stuff I'm
going to cancel you for the wrong
pronouns and stuff nope they're they're
I think there are zero Boys on that page
and I haven't heard of any girls I I'm
imagining there are but I haven't heard
of any
we can't get Libs of tick tock
what
who do I talk to that's still in school
that's a up question
yeah I I know you want to like
yeah I mean let me just say I I suspect
that that's a up question
if you live in the real world you know
lots of people have kids I've got I've
got uh
my own stepkids everybody's around kids
unless you live in a like an old folks
home or something it's hard to avoid the
real world
mind reading
why are you trying to influence to
believe it is okay
that what is okay
I don't know what you're talking about
the Alias the aliens of Mexico just sort
of went away didn't they
uh oh yeah uh New Jersey senator
Menendez was invite indicted for bribery
it sounds like they might have the goods
on them because it involved gold bars
apparently he accepted like uh four
hundred thousand dollars worth of gold
bars for something
hey
thank you for buying my book
uh
uh oh yeah Ken Paxton and so attorney
general Paxton was on Tucker's show
and Ken Paxton has the same belief that
many of you have which is the the
discontinuing of the counting on
Election night in 2020. followed by the
you know huge spike in Democrat votes
that didn't look organic is a definite
proof
that the election was rigged now that's
Ken Paxton's point of view and Tucker
seemed to be not only nodding along with
that and how many of you would be on the
same page
how many of you would say
that really is a strong signal of fraud
all right now how many of you have heard
the official explanation of why it
happened
how many could tell me in the comments
what's The Other Side Story
I'm not saying it's true
but could you tell me the Other Side
Story
like why that made sense and it's it's
just natural
well water leak was one location but it
wasn't just a one location problem right
weren't they just waiting for some stuff
to come in
well so the official story is that the
uh if you're counting if you're counting
the ballots that were Dropbox ballots
that they're highly weighted toward
Democrats
so if you counted the regular votes
during the day it would look close if
you counted only the the mail-in ballots
that had been done in some cases you
know well before the election those
would be heavily Democrat
so the official story
I don't know what's true but the
official story would look exactly the
same
now I hear you when you say I'm not
buying it because we've been lied to so
many times that not buying it is always
a good take
but what's wrong with the what's wrong
is there anything logically or factually
wrong with the claim that the only thing
that happened is that's when they
started seriously counting the uh the
mailed in early votes ballots is there
anything wrong with that
um
that explanation
why just those States because those are
the states where they where they stopped
counting for a while
it wouldn't be 100 Biden but that's not
the claim the claim is not that it was
100 button
just that there was more more button
but but the Biden votes could have
easily been three or four to one right
I don't know what the actual ratio is
but there's such a difference in who
votes by mail
that I think it's only three to four to
one Democrat advantage
yeah so the the competing the two
theories are this
one theory is that the reason they
stopped
is to find out how many they needed to
fake because they didn't want to fake
more than they needed to
if it's the observation wouldn't you say
the the hypothesis that the only reason
it was stopped was to count the votes
they needed and they ship in The Fakes
that fits the observation
but does it also not fit the observation
that it's exactly what they said which
is they stopped the votes it might have
been a water leak it might have been
some other reason but when they
restarted them they were into the
mail-in ballots and they were four to
one for Biden and that's all it was
what's wrong with that if it's
observation
now whether or not the water leak was
real
it wasn't just one place that stopped
counting was it
I mean they could have just gone home
and wanted to you know get some sleep
and take a shower or something they
might have just been there all day
so uh it wasn't four to one but it was a
big advantage in uh Democrats mailing
votes
all right so here's my problem with Ken
Paxton
and this is a persuasion lesson for you
if there are two hypotheses for why
something happened
one is you know hugely provocative the
other one would be sort of normal
it might not be true
but it would fit in the category of
normal things happening
if you say that you believe the
extraordinary one the provocative one
and you spend zero time talking about
what the other side said was the actual
explanation
you're full of
so Ken Braxton is full of
you might not be wrong
you might not be wrong I'm not judging
the accuracy of the claim I'm saying
that if you go on television in a big
venue like that
and you say there's one reason this
could happen when the other reason has
been offered and also affects the facts
I I lose all you have no credibility
after that no credibility
it wouldn't matter if you were
Republican or Democrat if you walk into
that situation and you ignore the other
explanation
then you can be ignored for anything
else you say
your credibility is at zero at that
point
now if here's what what credibility
would have sounded like
had he said well their claim was
that it's just because there are more
mail-in boats for Democrats here's why
that doesn't make sense
but where's that
I've been hearing the official
explanation forever
but not once not once have I heard
anybody say here's why the official
explanation
doesn't add up
I've never heard that have you
seems like the most obvious thing you'd
hear I've never heard it
so
if somebody has an argument of why the
official the official explanation
doesn't work
it might be a good argument and I'm I'm
completely open to it
because when Paxton and Tucker say this
looks super suspicious
I see it too
right don't get on me like I'm blind you
can't see it I see it I see it just as
clearly as you do I'm just saying that
when you listen to somebody who doesn't
even give a moment
to the fact that there's a a fairly
solid counter explanation that also fits
the observed facts
then I can't take you seriously after
that
Democrats stole it fair and square
that's sort of where I'm at where I'm at
is if they cheated better they won
I thought that on day one I've never
I've never changed the fact that I
congratulated Biden as soon as the race
was called I've never backed off from
that he he became the president that day
he's still the president
because if he cheated and won
well I guess the system allowed that you
don't think there were any Republicans
who cheated a little
I don't know
but that's the game
so if if cheating's just built into the
game
one side cheats better
I give them the win you got the win
congratulations Mr President
I I wish it were otherwise but that's
the way it is
Scott are we having a world moment I
don't know what that means
yeah the voter ID laws are automatically
registering some people
and again if that's why the Democrats
win well played
if the Democrats win because they made
it easier to register migrants
and so they can illegally vote
well played good job
I don't think that's going to be the big
thing I don't imagine most of the
immigrants caring about voting
the the fact that they could vote
doesn't seem related to the fact that
they might I just don't see it happening
you know the ones who came in this year
how many people who walked over the
Border this year
are going to vote
you know even they're not allowed to but
technically they could probably get away
with it if they have the right ID but
who's going to do it
I don't know maybe if you pay them or
something
it seems like not even a risk they would
take money for because it's pretty hard
to get here you know you don't want to
be sent back and have to come back again
so I would think that they would not
take a chance on something as
inconsequential as one vote in an
election that they don't even know who's
running
all right
um
they won't be involved
yeah maybe
[Music]
uh how do we defeat the machine I don't
think you can
maybe you need to join them maybe we
should all just become Democrats well
that would work
if if all Republicans just re-registered
as Democrats
they could probably have anything they
wanted
what would stop you from doing that
couldn't 100 of Democrats just
re-register
it would make it would make all polling
obsolete
you can make polling obsolete
just re-register
that's what I did that's why I'm a
registered Democrat once the Democrats
labeled me a racist I thought well I'm
not going to slime the poor Republicans
they didn't do anything to me
so I decided to take my bad reputation
over to the Democrats where it belongs
Andrew Tate just registered as a
Democrat did that really happen
I can't tell if you're joking
no he can't well he can't vote wait a
minute he's not even a citizen does he
oh
I don't think you can vote
all right uh fetterman has been replaced
by a body double
where in the world would you get a
second person who looks like
looks like him
and if you wanted a body double would
you give your body double a porn
mustache because I feel like the porn
mustache
sort of a giveaway
he does look different
yeah it does look different and he's
admitted that he has some kind of
permanent cognitive at least linguistic
problem
so but I guess the Democrats are happy
with that they got what they wanted
all right that's all I got for you today
YouTube
um
predicting we won't need to vote
well I think he was being hyper
hyperbolic when he said that
all right that's all for now YouTube
talk to you tomorrow
