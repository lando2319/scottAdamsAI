[Applause]
good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
if not the highlight of
your entire day and that what that's
what matters most because you know for
most of civilization
i hate to break it to you
you weren't even here
you were a little bit irrelevant to most
of civilization
but now that you're here
wouldn't it be great
to take it up a notch to go to the
height
the height
of happiness
on my birthday
today's my birthday
happy birthday to me
and if you'd like to
celebrate my birthday with me
turn 65 today
uh all you need is a special birthday
copper mug or glass attacker tells us
sign that can't be a jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better the special
birthday
sip
happens now go
oh now in the comments someone nicely
said i deserve a nice day
well
that's not true at all
i don't deserve anything
nobody deserves anything we kind of get
what we get
but
how would you like me to give you an
idea that would make all of us
80 of us
much happier
it goes like this
and it's all i want from my birthday
have you ever tried to
send a text message
and
you're kind of worked up you're angry
about something
and you're going to use that f word
and you've got your text message and
your your body is shaken and your thumbs
are quivering and you're like alright i
love that that effing thing
and you get to the end of your sentence
and you get ready to send
and spell correct has changed it to
ducking
d-u-c-k
now i don't know about you
but on a statistical basis
the number of times i've wanted to type
ducking
but
you know
didn't
it's very very small
very small times i've ever wanted to use
such as
i was ducking
the debris
i mean it doesn't really come up that
often
and i can see why the impulse for the
the spell correctors would be to give us
the clean word
just in case
but i would like to suggest the
following
number one
they have picked the very worst time
the worst time
to duck with me
because when i'm already mad and i'm
sending a text message with that f word
in it
do you know what is the only thing that
can make me more angry
at that moment
is having to pause
and scroll back scroll
scroll
scroll
scroll
not d not d
delete
f
yes yes yes
yes i mean it
now compare that
compare that to the alternative
here here i was already mad and it made
me more angry
and i still sent the the bad word
did they gain anything at all no no good
will
nothing was helped
but imagine if they went the other way
flip it around 180.
suppose if every time you tried to write
ducking
as in you were
ducking the pitch
or ducking the golf ball
what if it auto-corrected to
effing
am i right
because then when you got one of those
messages that somebody accidentally
sent
it would be hilarious
it would say
when the when the gunfire rang out i
hope you were
and you would read that message and
you'd say what
why would you well it's a nice thought
but oh
oh it got auto-corrected it got
auto-corrected
it should have been ducking
and then what would you do
you'd laugh
you'd laugh you'd laugh and you'd laugh
could you ever have a better day than
that no
that would be
a total gift
so let me
summarize
current method
takes an angry person
makes them angrier
makes you hate their product
bad
and you still send the bad word anyway
my way
everybody gets a good laugh
oops
oops
i meant you should have been ducking
sorry mom
come on
you tell me that wouldn't be funnier
there are very few situations where's
all upside and no downside i think this
is one of them
and that's all i want for my birthday by
the way it's johnny depp's birthday
tomorrow
i don't know why that's important
i believe
kanye who uh i call yay
has his birthday today too
all of that means absolutely nothing
because michael schellenberger
did not succeed into getting into the
final two in the governor's race
in california but i gotta say
i'm really proud of the
the
campaign he ran
and
i feel as if something good should come
out of this
meaning that at least people saw what it
looks like
to run a rational campaign
in which you're focusing on you know
proven
solutions you're not trying to be
political
now why did it not work
almost certainly because he wasn't part
of
the established you know democrat
machine
so
there was no no amount of good ideas no
amount of effort no amount of
qualifications
there really could make a difference in
our state we're just so constipated with
democrat politics
but
i would argue that andrew yang
did not have as practical solutions as
michael schellenberger
promotes
yang yang had ideas that were a little
bit more futuristic so they might work
and i definitely think a lot of his
ideas were worth testing
but
that was a more speculative kind of
futuristic whereas i think
schellenberger
really says far more practically we
already know what works
we don't really need to experiment the
experiment's done just implement
so the the most rational message anybody
ever brought to the electorate and the
electorate largely i think maybe
we're not aware of him because it's just
so hard to break through
so i think that probably is the whole
story there
let's talk about the
slippery slope
you know one of the things i've always
disliked about that slippery slope theme
which i've grudgingly decided
you know does exist there is there is a
slippery slope i have said in the past
that it's just bad thinking
but i'm coming around that there are
some situations in which the best way to
describe them is a slippery slope
however i insist i insist
on adding this
visual update to the slippery slope
here's what i like to add
at the bottom of every slippery slope
there's a brick wall
if you give me that we're on the same
page
i'll give you the slippery part
but i've always said yes
you don't have to worry about it
because at the end of the slippery
there's always a brick wall
now you might say to yourself that's not
true here are all these examples where
it just keeps going
to which i say it just hasn't hit the
wall yet
right that in in retrospect you'll look
back and a lot of people will say that
was progress
you hit the wall when everybody agrees
you've gone too far
and that happened in san francisco last
night
where the san francisco d.a who was the
the super progressive one who
uh
basically thought criminals should be
set free
was uh recalled
so even liberal san francisco said you
know
uh i feel like we're done with this
i think we would like law and order in
san francisco
so
did the
lawlessness and the democrat
you know craziness
was it a slippery slope
yes
yes it was
i mean we slippery sloped all the way to
destroying san francisco if that's not a
slippery slope what is
but
turns out there might be a brick wall at
the bottom of the slippery slope
and and i think
i think the voters
depending on how you want to use this
imagery
hit the you hit the wall last night and
they just said
up up
this is too far
now
you don't want to
say there's a trend building on you know
one day of voting or anything like that
but there did seem to be some
trends
that maybe are surfacing maybe
one would be the school choice people
had a good night i guess in iowa
there was a lot of you know victory for
this the school choice people
that feels like a wall
doesn't it
it feels like that you know the schools
were slippery sloping to
horribleness and they were certainly in
horribleness
and maybe
maybe school choice is the brick wall
it's like okay okay
that's far enough
so
it's always hard to know
when you're
sliding like crazy
and when you're actually you know one
second away from hitting a brick wall
but it's useful to know that
usually a brick wall comes up
not every time
um
here's a
sort of a messaging persuasion thing
i've been doodling with what would
happen
if republicans
started uh
using their own solutions but using the
democrats arguments
and i think you'll see there are a few
examples of this
and i can't tell if there's a way to do
this more generally or just a few
interesting examples let me give you
this one example
so i tweeted today
if you lived in a country bristling with
white supremacists
what kind of tool or device would help
you protect your family
and the choices were a stick a gun
or the third choice was i don't like my
family
and
of course the message here in the
humorous form
is that if you actually believed that
white supremacists were
a rising force
i feel as if you'd want to have some
guns if you were a person of color
and so
what would happen
and i'm just sort of noodling through it
i'm not saying this is a good idea i'm
just just sort of like noodling
what would happen
if
the republicans just started embracing
the democrats most crazy statements
and acted as though they believed them
it couldn't make things worse let me
give you the most extreme example
suppose republicans did a pro-gun ad
in which they used the
the charlottesville fine people hoax but
they treated it like it really happened
the really happened part is not that the
there were neo-nazis that that did
happen obviously
but the the part of the hoax is that the
trump
praised the neo-nazis
what if they just
they didn't have to say anything about
trump so they wouldn't have to lie they
could just show show the imagery of
charlottesville
and say
you know maybe
if you're worried about this
maybe you should own a gun
second amendment
now
is it a terrible idea
so
one of one of the things that was at the
san francisco chronicle headline i
thought i saw a joel pollock tweet on
this
that san francisco is interpreting this
uh
this recall of their progressive uh d.a
they're looking at that as oh it has
nothing to do with what the right wing
wants
it's just people want a city that works
and i thought to myself
a city that works
you mean do all the things that the
republicans say you should do
that that's how you get it to work
literally
being you know more aggressive about
crime
or you know punishing crime
so
i just wonder how many of these
arguments could be
turned around you know the the one my
favorite one is
if you embrace the systemic racism let's
say you're a republican
you embrace systemic racism as a primary
thing
like a primary like force in a reason
that you're you're running and then you
say and we have to work at the source
which is the uh
the teachers
unions so you totally accept their
argument the systemic racism
but you use that argument to dismantle
the thing that actually is the biggest
problem
like
would people would people start to
notice that you kept using democrat
arguments but are republican solutions
because i think you could do it all day
long i'm not sure
but i feel like a lot of the things
you could cast that way and you would be
impossible to ignore
if if you ran as a candidate
who literally said i'm going to give you
a democrat view of the world
and then i'm going to show the idea to
solve it with republican policies now
it's not going to work for abortion
right
there could be a few things it just
doesn't work for
so how about you say
uh
you know there's a group that wants to
promote more lgbtq
awareness or openness or whatever
however they would say it
in schools and a lot of the
conservatives are saying no that's too
young
you know we want our kids to do it
so how about instead you say
we need
we need to you need to be able to send
your kids
to a school where they can learn
to appreciate all people that would be
the
democrat version
and then say the solution to that is
school choice
so you democrats
have a choice to send your children to
exactly the kind of school you want to
send them to
why should you
send your kids to a school which
republicans have designed
does that make sense to
no so you take the democrats own
argument
that you you wanna you wanna teach your
kids to be
you know educated about
openness and the differences among
people in a productive way
how about we help you
how about we help you get that choice
and then we get out of your business
and the republicans would say there's
nothing i want more of them to get out
of your business
i just would like the same
you know in return i would like you to
get out of my business
think think how often you could you
could use their arguments and then a
republican solution
all right
so maybe the country is closer to
sticking together than we think
over in the united kingdom they're going
to test the four day work week pretty
seriously
so there are 3 300 workers and 70
businesses across the whole range of
industries
that are going to participate
and apparently this has been done before
in iceland they did a study between 2015
and 2019
and
they found that the employees who
volunteered i guess to work the shorter
work weeks
had the same productivity
now
what do you think about that
do you think
do you think that in general a four-day
work week would work as well as a
five-day work week
because i don't think it's four times
ten i think it's still i think it's 32
hours instead of 40.
i believe is the idea
well one way to look at it is that you
can reduce uh
most business expenses by 25 it doesn't
make a difference
there's a lot of things that you
overspend for
that if you just stop doing it
you find it didn't work out as poorly as
you imagined
so it wouldn't be shocking at all
if people could figure out how to do
fewer meetings and more work
that wouldn't surprise me
um
i don't know i i will watch this with
interest
but i've got a feeling that
there are other reasons that people go
to work
and so one of the things they say is
that people are more productive if you
know if you can teach people to stop
bothering each other at work
and
dropping in and having meetings that are
too long and stuff like that you'd be
more productive
but i i feel as if for everyone who
wants someone to stop
dropping into their cubicle
there's someone who really needs to do
the dropping in
because the people who are always doing
the dropping in are like lonely people
who need to talk to somebody because
they don't have anybody at home
you know there's a huge social
part to work
that if you decrease that
i don't know that people are happier at
their house
wasn't one of the big problems with the
pandemic
that it caused people to be home more
and people are like you know
two days at home with my family
that's just about right
five days at home with my family
that's a lot of family
so i've got a feeling that there's some
unintended consequences of the short
work weeks but i'm glad that they're
testing it
why because we should test everything
that can be tested
just
general statement
if there are people who want to do this
it's funded
we're all curious about the outcomes it
matters it's important
yeah let's test it so uh thumbs up to
the uk
for being uh leaders and
at least testing this stuff
so here's another uh
story that fits into the theme so george
takai do you follow him on twitter
so he was he played sulu in the original
star trek
and he's pretty active in
left-leaning politics on twitter
especially anything with lgbtq stuff
and
so he tweeted this
yesterday i think he says crazy thought
but those 20 million ar-15s now in this
country could sure arm a lot of
ukrainians
now
is that not an example
of a left-leaning person completely
agreeing with republicans but they just
can't say it out loud
because here's the other way to say what
george takai just said
the only reason the united states
doesn't have to worry about being
overthrown is we have 20 million ar-15s
now it's not like i was worried that
canada was gonna overrun us anytime soon
but
i do feel safer with knowing that my my
fellow citizens
which always sounds sexist to me what's
the non-sexist way to say my fellow
citizens
is there a non-sexist word for that yet
my they citizens
my they citizens
my comrades
sounds wrong
no then now that didn't trip off the
tongue just right
we citizens
well i'm glad we citizens have 20
million ar-15s
although i admit that whenever there's a
mass shooting
i say to myself what the hell
what the hell
so this feels like another one of those
situations
where you could agree with george takai
and just sort of like make a commercial
end of his opinion
and say and that's why
russia isn't
isn't invading america i mean that's the
ridiculous version
so rasmussen
in their polling reminds us
that the
top voter concerns in this order number
one
inflation two election integrity
and number three violent crime
do these things seem like the same
priorities that you're seeing on
television
um and from your politicians
have there been a lot of uh cnn specials
about how to improve election integrity
no there have been lots of uh lots of
specials telling you that the elections
were fine
they're just fine
it's the number two issue in america
think of all the issues we have
we've got some better pretty bad stuff
floating around right
and still number two is election
integrity because people know
people know intuitively that if you
don't have that part right all of the
other stuff doesn't get fixed
and you've taken away your your ability
to do anything really
so
i think rasmussen does a great job you
know for the country
by reminding us that our politicians and
our news services are not giving us what
we're asking for
what we're really asking for is can you
at least make sure the elections work
please
can you please
just give us one one thing
just one
can you just get on the same side that
the the voting machines should count the
actual votes
can we agree on that
it feels like something we could get to
you know we could rally around but not
in our
divisive country
here's a
reframe
that i've been working
on um those of you who know my life
story
you might know that i grew up in a small
town
windham new york
in upstate new york
there were
40 people in my graduating class maybe 2
000 people in the town
and
the first thing that i did after i
graduated college
and i went to college in a nearby town
only on to new york
the first thing i did was move
to san francisco
why did i do that
yeah it was hartwick college
i got a degree in economics why why did
i
why was the first thing i did
to move to san francisco
it's because i was chasing luck
uh over on youtube somebody says because
you're gay
[Laughter]
no follow along
try to get back on back on track here
it was funny though um
no i went to san francisco
because it's where the energy was right
it's where the energy was and i wanted
to go somewhere where there were more
opportunities more chances to get lucky
and just more stuff happening and i
thought to myself okay i was lucky that
i
i could do that like it was physically
possible for me to do that
now imagine you're looking at any
impoverished inner city area
let's take chicago
you've got high crime and you know
economics are terrible in certain parts
of the city
how would you fix it
well i'll tell you the worst way to fix
it keep everybody where they are
and try to make it better there
that might be the worst way to do it
because the the concentration of trouble
making people
is probably too high
and so that nothing you do there is
going to make a difference it's like
donating food to
countries where they have
warlords
you can give them all the food you want
but the warlords are gonna steal it all
when it hits the ground right it doesn't
help
it doesn't help to help
because the people there's just too much
of a concentration of criminal element
or whatever
so
in my opinion the number one thing that
you need to do to help anybody who's in
that situation is to move them
and i'm wondering
how much poverty and
i know every problem in the world
could you solve if it were real easy for
poor people to move
and that is really the hardest thing in
the world
it's really pretty hard
to just say okay i'm going to move to
san francisco just because it's a better
place to be like who can really do that
i mean i was very very fortunate and it
was a point in time and let's be honest
i was a i was a white male
things were easier if you were a white
male in those days
right so i had everything going for me
in a sense
but imagine if you could pick out
the b students and above
in every poor place
and you just say all right
you gotta you gotta be average on your
own by sixth grade i'll just
pick a random
grade so you got all the way to sixth
grade and somehow
somehow you pulled at least b's bees
we're going to give you the option to
pull your whole family out of there
and some kind of you know government
greased you know you don't want the
government to get bigger i know but
there's probably some way to
create a even a private
you know app kind of situation where you
can get people out
and get them to a job
now i've talked about this before but
but
uh the more apps become ubiquitous the
more practical this is
imagine if you had an app
that was designed to help people escape
where they live
let's say domestically eventually it
could be include other countries but
just domestically and
let's say you're uh you're a single mom
and you know you just can't do enough
for your kid
you want to you just can't do enough so
you go in the app and you say
like i need to escape i need to get out
of here and then other people go on the
app and say i'd like to help you escape
like i'll be one of the people
i can't afford to do it all myself but i
could give you know 20 bucks or whatever
to help you escape
but in return here's the deal
you've got to show us your kids report
card and it's got to be at least b's
for let's say you know one year or
something
whatever it is so the mother says all
right i got one thing to do
i'm going to make sure my kid gets b's
like it's it might be a herculean task
you might have to like lock him in
but maybe for one year you could do it
if you were really incentivized
and then you meet that simple test yeah
there would be fraud there's fraud and
everything you know you do your best to
get past it but you get to that point
and then then you get an option that
people put together a moving package
they say all right here are several
options
you can move to this town we'll help you
connect with the people who make that
easy and inexpensive to do
and we've even got a job lined up for
you that's in your field and will get
you trained
i i feel as if
individuals helping individuals
and then following their story would be
more entertaining than actual
entertainment
let me say it again suppose you could go
onto an app and pay 20 bucks
to help somebody that somehow has been
vetted to be not a fraud
that you're actually just part of their
cheering community
to help them out
so you get to follow somebody's life you
follow them on social media and maybe
that's a requirement or a suggestion you
say look we'd like to be able to follow
your life
so post as much as you can on social
media and we'll just follow you
and if you're doing well we'll give more
money
but if it looks like you've you're you
know you're in with a bad crowd or
something if there's some way to find
out
maybe we won't
but if you do well we'll back you and
we'll give you advice
right lots of advice and connections and
we'll help you get a job with somebody
we know in that town and stuff like that
but i feel as if
all these kids are becoming they're
trying to become social media stars
when they really just need to be good
people
imagine if you will
that a kid said hey i could use social
media
and tick doc
to help my future life
and all i have to do
is offer myself up and say hey i need
help
i'm in a bad situation
i live in a tough town i'd like to get
out
can you be my can you be my virtual
mentors
and in return i will keep you informed
of my life so you can see that whatever
you do is helping me or not
and i'll give you some you know
transparency about how i'm doing
and you could just sponsor me
and and then the people sponsoring could
argue among themselves
whether they're doing a good job
so they you know the sponsors would
police each other
it'd all be transparent the
in every case the parent would have to
have access to everything
right
the the parent
has to see all of it and approve it
right that's that's just gotta that has
to be
um
you you want to turn people into social
workers no
so somebody says you want to turn people
into social workers
as soon as you added a worker you lost
you lost the idea entirely
there's nothing about this that's this
work
that's the idea
see
the the greatest untapped resource
in the world
is people's generosity
let me say that again the biggest
untapped resource in the world is
people's natural generosity and the
reason that it's not activated is that
we don't trust the people asking for it
right
you just don't trust
that if you use your generosity it's
necessarily going to be turned into
something positive
i i think i've done this before on the
live stream but let me do it again
do you know how many times i've tried to
help somebody
who had you know financial situation or
some kind of a big problem
a lot
because for
three decades i've been in a situation
where i had more than i needed
so
lots of times i've tried to help
somebody who was in a bad situation
now let me ask you this
how many times did it work
as in once you solve this temporary
problem
somebody went on to a good successful
life
okay here's here's the answer
it's not zero
it's not zero
it might be ten percent
it might be ten percent and probably
twenty percent you know really did make
a big difference
eighty percent
is just people referred to whoever they
were
so the person who got into trouble is
the person who's going to get into
trouble again
unfortunately you know helping people
temporarily
doesn't really
by definition
doesn't have a permanent effect but
it's totally worth doing
for the 10
if i look at the
the people who
you know
for whom i have made an actual
difference
it really did make a difference
and so you know i'll be able to
enjoy my senior years
knowing that at least 10 percent of the
people i tried to help
genuinely got helped
like really really made a difference
and that is very very rewarding
now
how how entertaining is it to know that
you help somebody
it's one of the greatest pleasures you
can receive
so my generosity is automatically
rewarded
when it works
the problem is that generosity
doesn't work
we live in a world in which
we're not tribal
so i could i could send my generosity
out into the world and it just gets
absorbed and
taken for granted right
it doesn't come back in any way so right
now if we had an app that simply
captured generosity
and made sure that it wasn't um
at least
maybe the trick is to you have to
diversify your generosity so that you
can see the 10 that worked so so maybe
you're always investing in more than one
person
perhaps a fund of people
you can even have somebody who organizes
a fund to see who's worthy to get
you know part of to be part of the app
so anyway you can you can imagine a
situation
in which you could untap generosity
people would get something immediately
in return for their generosity
and you would create a virtuous
cycle
all right that's the best idea you've
heard all day
but if our republican the way i would
put it is we're going to help democrats
move out of democratic cities
see
see how many things you can you can take
as a democrat argument with a republican
solution
democrat cities have too many guns
too much gun violence
we republicans will help you move out of
those places
and live where there are just as many
guns but no gun violence
it's called wyoming
or something i know now
have you seen all the advertisements for
adus the uh
what's it called uh
you can put an extra little house on
your property um
adu what's that stand for
something unit dwelling unit
affordable dwelling unit adu
so that industry has recently exploded
and a whole bunch of companies that make
basically a house in a box
and one of them i think is called
boxable and i think elon musk actually
has an investment in it
and it comes in a truck and it unfolds
into a proper little house
that's got you know bathroom and a
bedroom and
you know a tiny kitchen kind of
situation
so
here's what i think is going to be the
big thing
somebody's going to develop some land
in a remote place that has good weather
and lots of water
and wi-fi
and they're going to say you can put any
kind of adu here and
and live there
the adu would just be
where you live
and
and you could have more than one
so you might have a family that needs
you know two of them and you just
stick them together
and
people like me
could invest in them
so you'd say scott you can invest in
this little you know square piece of
land in wyoming
and we'll tell you how to invest in any
one of these adus and we'll put it there
you don't have to do any work
you just have to put the money in you'll
own the land you'll own the adu and
we'll rent it for you
the rent will be low
because that's the whole idea
but
since it costs so little for you to
invest in that little piece of dirt and
that little adu
you'll get your money back
so you might want to invest in several
of them and i say oh
actually i do
i wouldn't mind owning
several adus like little mini
investments
and then you say to the people who are
maybe living there
you know
if you will manage the one next door
i'll give you uh
you know breaking rent
and then suddenly they've got work
they've got a place to go they can
you know work remotely anyway i think we
need a place to take people who have
promise and some drive
pull them out of their situation put
them in a good situation stop talking
about the guns that are in the bad
situation and start talking about
pulling the people out and getting them
into a
place where they can be educated and
safe
most investors are not generous well
that's true
that's true if your mode is investor
you're not generous right because those
are
different you know being an investor is
being selfish
that's what it's supposed to be it won't
work if you don't try to be selfish
so the steve bannon situation
got interesting i guess there were
12 jurors warranted to convict steve
bannon associate uh
timmy timothy shea
and uh there was one hold out so there's
one
trump supporting holdout
who just
hung the jury
and it just turned completely political
but of course this is in the backdrop of
the
larger story
which is it does appear that
conservatives are being treated
differently by the government
than
the left
so does that feel true
i don't know if it's true
i'm not totally sold
that the prominent anecdotes we've seen
really show us a trend
but it sure looks like it doesn't it
like the the anecdotal the anecdotal
stuff is
very persuasive
i just don't know that
we aren't being fooled by anecdotes
does anybody have that
suspicion
because if you ask me if it's persuasive
totally but if he asked me if it's
really true
i don't know
how would i know how would you know
i wouldn't know has anybody anybody done
some kind of rigorous
study that would you know
that would tell us whether this is
really happening
now the prominent cases it just looks
that way but i don't know
yeah i know i know the anecdotes i know
the peter navarro i know the
the stone
it does look as though they are being
mistreated
in in every way it has that look
but
just because they're being mistreated
i don't know if that's part of a bigger
thing
but it could be
it could be i'm definitely worried about
it
um
all right
um
yeah if you compare peter navarro's
situation to the way hillary
was treated etc
you know this uh this january 6 stuff
is this going to backfire on the
democrats
did you see the david axelrod tweet
in which he was
i felt he was warning his own team
because the new york times the new york
times treated the january 6 hearings
as a
a political strategy by the left
and david axelrod was saying uh
i don't think you want to be happy if
you're a democrat and you see
the press
say it's a political thing
because the new york times basically
treated it like it was just a political
act
and axelrod is saying um i think you
need to let the evidence go where the
evidence goes
now which is the correct thing to say in
public of course
and i've got a feeling that this is this
is going to backfire gigantically
because
at some point
the republicans get to talk right
now i'm not talking about during the
hearings themselves
but a lot of republicans are going to
talk about it
you know are you telling me that the the
mainstream media isn't going to have any
republicans on
don't they have to
i mean how often does cnn and msnbc have
a prominent republican on to interview
actually i don't know the answer to the
question does that happen often
never
i
because there's not there's not as much
cross-pollination
as there should be
but i do think republicans are going to
have to get a you know there's going to
have to be some kind of response and
it's going to be newsworthy
but i think that the if the republicans
simply use it as a place to grandstand
and
call out the
the left for exactly what's happening
here
it could really really work for the
republicans in a big way so axelrod is
completely right the fact that the left
is is not trying to hide the fact that
it's purely political
that has to
that has to have some
blow back
doesn't it
if you're not even pretending is
anything but political
it also makes all of the other cases
like the peter navarro and
it makes all the other cases look like
they were political too
because
they largely are
right
yeah they produced a good morning
america producer to
to do that
um
yes the house not the senate right
but still i think the senate is going to
be
pretty vocal about what's going on
um
so there are no republican members of
the january 6 committee you're saying
but there will still be lots of
republican voices
won't there
won't will republicans be interviewed by
the january 6 people on tv
well let me ask you this who exactly is
going to be talking
because it doesn't matter who's asking
the questions it also matters who's
answering right
who will be the prominent people
interviewed the
hearings
actually i have no idea who
who exactly are they just going to be
showing video and evidence are they
going to be interviewing people
what exactly is happening
on thursday can somebody tell me
uh two rhinos on it yeah okay
okay well
i guess i don't know
i guess i don't know what we'll see
but i'll probably watch it
who's going to be watching that
they can get away with it that is why
they're doing it
you know i think the fact
that there are no
real republicans on that committee
that should tell the democrats something
schiff is leading the show
you're not serious are you
is adam schiff in charge of that
seriously
now
how is it that adam schiff is not hated
by his own team
is it only
because i don't like what he says that
makes me think he's the
the worst
um the worst figurehead for your cause
i mean he's like he's like the jeffrey
dahmer of politicians
like i look at him and i have just such
a visceral reaction
and i can't tell if that's
just because i don't like what he says
is that
if i liked what he said would he
come across to me as a like a reasonable
patriot or something
i don't know he's just got the look of
something's wrong
he and swalwell have that same thing
there's something about their look
that i can't get past
yeah
crazy eyes maybe
reptilian
all right so have i
hit all the big points for today
yes i have
and
can we agree
that this is the best
birthday live stream of all time
yeah i think so and would you join me in
a special
birthday closing sip
some of you would
yes
