good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams the finest
experience you've ever had in your
entire life if you'd like to take it up
to levels that nobody can even
understand all you need is a CER micro
glass a tanker gel suin a canteen jugg
or flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure it's a dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous zip
go oh so so good so good well it's a
very newsy day and may I say to all of
you happy Oaks day everybody it's
January 6 where we celebrate all the
hoaxes played Upon Us by our own
government now you might say to yourself
but
Scott is it some kind of national
holiday no not yet because that would be
government sanctioned this is actually a
holiday to make fun of your government
for perpetually hoaxing you let's see if
we can do the Full Count let's see 2016
election Russia collusion
hoax 2020 election fine people hoax 2024
election January 6 Insurrection hoax and
that's why today is National hoax day
and happy hoax Day to all of you we're
gonna have a good good show today so
don't go
anywhere
well now how would you celebrate happy
Oaks day um you know Traditions do you
ever wonder how Traditions
start you ever have a a curiosity about
that you always think wait a minute why
am I putting gifts in a sock why am I
putting a sock on my fireplace like who
came up with that idea and this is how
it
happens some creative person such as
myself comes up with the idea and that
it just catches on everywhere so for
National hoax day I would recommend that
we celebrate it the following
way number one if you want to dress
traditionally wear a bison hat
that's right bison hat maybe wrap
yourself in an American flag that's in
terms of costuming and uh
pageantry it's the Bison hat now if
you'd like to act in a way that is
compatible with uh National hoax day I
recommend sauntering around while taking
selfies of
yourself well that's redundant
sauntering while taking selfies may I
give you my
best impression of a January 6
insurrectionist doing Insurrection
things sure it looks a lot like
this happy Hulk's
day now if you if you didn't know what I
was doing there it probably scared you
when you first saw it if anybody just
signed on and you saw me sauntering and
take a selfie I wasn't trying to conquer
the country I promise no no I know it
looks like it it looks exactly like in
Insurrection but I promise you I wasn't
I wasn't I was just pretending watch
I'll do it
again
click see not not trying to take over
the country but it looks like it doesn't
it like when you look at this doesn't
that scare you it's like how will our
nuclear forces
ever survive these selfies
click I that was
scary well um let's see the Babylon B
notes that Adam kensinger's Mom let him
open one present on January 6th
Eve that's right Adam kiner get open one
present on January 6 Eve we don't know
what it
was speaking of hoaxes uh do you
remember remember the story about the
ten aliens at the Miami uh shopping
mall well it wasn't it wasn't so much 10
foot
aliens it was very close to that though
so you could see why they would be
confused it wasn't 10- foot aliens it
was some teenagers uh m
around well you could understand how
people would think that was 10 foot
aliens attacking the
Earth
teenagers with sticks 10lot aliens is
very similar now some people say it's
because there was a big shadow cast upon
something who knows maybe well I just
realized I didn't post my dilber comic
today all right I'll do it right after
the
show
um so that was a hoax there were no 10-
foot aliens just
teenagers um my next segment I
call backwards
science backwards science this is where
you see if you can untangle cause and
effect in a way that your best
scientists could not so let's see if you
can top the scientists on National hoax
day all right here's the uh
science uh in both the US and England
and I guess India and China too they
found a high correlation between if your
spouse has high blood pressure you're
are far more likely to develop yourself
that's right in the United States 9%
more likely to have high blood pressure
if your spouse has
it huh what could possibly cause
that what could possibly cause your
spouse to have some poition kind of a
thing with your high blood pressure
could it
be that you end up having the same
habits over
time that if one of you is a
foodie probably the other one's going to
eat more than they wanted to am I right
if one of you really really likes to
have a glass of wine after dinner isn't
it a little bit more likely that the
other one would drink at least more than
they might have
otherwise so so don't you think this is
completely lifestyle plus fat people
marry other fat
people and again I don't I don't do fat
shaming we're talking purely medically
from an obesity
perspective it's some more rare to see a
skinny person marry an obese person it
does happen but it's sort of less common
so does this have anything to do with
marriage and everything to do with
lifestyle
imitation I think so yeah I think they
they left out a few things
here well Elon Musk is uh happily
reposting a claim from Doge
designer uh apparently there's some kind
of NP digital I don't know some kind of
study that found out that the highest
return on ad spending was on the
xplatform for the whole year I think the
uh
the highest return in other words if you
if you advertised on the xplatform you
were far more likely to get a click or a
sale so how do you like 2024 so far it
is the weirdest thing as soon as the the
clock turned
2024 everything started going my way
like everything that I would want to
happen I check the news I like oh there
it is yep that's exactly what I wanted
to happen and it's happening so here's
the question how would you like to
be uh the ad buyer for a big Corporation
when you made a real big deal and have
uh making sure that you were not on the
xplatform because Media Matters told you
that you'd be uh you'd be paired with uh
neonazi content which was never
true and so musk is suing Media Matters
and now we find out that any idiot who
took their advertising off of the
xplatform uh cost their employer a lot
of
money is that fair that anybody Who
removed their advertising from the
xplatform now that there's evidence it
was the highest return they should all
be
fired because they made the wrong
decisions right I'm sure that won't
happen but all right uh here's a uh
headline on a post for that comes from
axios you axios is a newer news entity
and here's how they framed their story
they said musk is shaping the future of
Transportation communication artificial
intelligence and space wow so it looks
like it looks like there's going to be
this really good article about Elon Musk
because he's he's shaping the future of
Transportation community communication
artificial intelligence space they must
have some good things to say about them
let's read the rest of the sentence and
enormous maybe even unprecedented
concentration of power and
influence oh so it's a bad
thing that's right axos has decided that
maybe we're in danger because Elon Musk
has too much concentration of power do
you know what that makes me do
immediately when I see that headline
it's the same thing you should do you
should immediately not read the article
and you should go to Google and you
should do a Google search to find out
who owns
axios who owns
axios do you know if you don't
know then you should not read
it let me say that again you shouldn't
read the news on any platform that you
don't know who owns it because who owns
it is going to determine the you know
the nature of the content so it's owned
by um I need a fact check on this but I
think it's owned by a family-owned
business the Cox
family is that is that true or mostly
owned by
them and are the Cox family not uh
notable
Democrats can you do a fact check on me
because it was a little unclear when I
Googled it what's going on there but it
looks like Cox Cox family no you don't
spend it you don't spell it that way
locals platform but thanks for asking no
it is Cox Cox is how they
spell but see see if it looks to you
like uh axios is just owned by a
Democrat entity which would suggest it's
not real news and that in a in an
election year it should slant you know
Pro Democrats that's what I'd expect now
that doesn't mean it has to happen I'm
just saying if you're a Savvy news
consumer you should always
know who owns them if you don't know who
owns The Entity you don't know
anything all right you should also
expect let let me tell you what I was
telling a young
person um a few weeks ago so a few weeks
ago I was describing to a young person
the the basics of Stock Investing and
one of the things I said was you can
never time the market you know that's
why you should be in index funds I don't
give Financial advice by the way none of
this is financial advice but I said but
one thing you can usually count on is
that because the Press is lean
left and the government at the moment is
also
Democrat at least the White House what
you should expect is that the economic
data for the coming year in an election
year especially if you have an incumbent
that um the economic data is going to be
skewed toward very positive news and
that that would be a natural and
predictable effect of the Democrats
controlling the news as well as the way
house so what I said was you can never
time the market but there is this one
thing that seems to be consistent that
the news will look more positive if the
people who control the news want you to
think things are more positive does that
sound
fair and therefore I said if you're
going to own stock it would be good to
own it before the before the election
year in in this specific
case sure
enough did you see the jobs
numbers the hill reports it this way
surprise jobs data gives boost to Biden
as the election year
begins that is literally the least
surprising headline and I could have
written it one month ago one month ago
without knowing anything if I didn't
know anything about the economy I could
have said okay in one month they're
going to say the economy is looking
better than you expected of course it
would be better than you expected and
the most important part jobs because if
you don't have a job that's bad so yeah
now I always have to make this
distinction is it also true that the
economy is doing well sort of sort of
you know I I'm the only person I know
who is a public figure who predicted
that the economy would be better than
people expected right now so it is
actually Better Than People expected I
think we still have an existential
threat with debt nobody's figured that
out but everything except
debt looks pretty
good you know that's sort of sort of
like saying you know you're very healthy
except for the terminal cancer I get it
I get it so I don't know how we solve
that but at least but at least we have
one or two candidates who have an
idea so I think both VI and Trump would
have similar Concepts which is you
unleash our
energy um industry in the United States
and that should make the GDP you know
Zoom it should give us extra cash and if
you ever have any chance of paying down
your debt you can have to do it by
unleashing the productivity of the
country you know cut cut the regulations
let the energy flow energy is the
biggest economic driver of the country
because it drives the cost of everything
else so in theory we could drive our
cost of living down enough we'd have
some extra money to pay off some debt in
theory all
right um Brian remelli is talking about
some new uh studies that says that your
heart includes
memory so apparently your brain is not
isolated in in his skull and then your
body is like this other machine that's
doing its own thing and they just talk
to each other there there's evidence I'm
not sure how much I believe but there's
evidence that memories are stored in
other parts of the body like like the
heart I guess there are examples of
people who got
transplants and then somehow picked up
the memory of the person who had the
original
heart I have to say I'm skeptical of
that I'm skeptical but open to it but
skeptical however I'd like to put my own
spin on this story which is
this why have we historically why have
we separated the brain from the rest of
the body well it's because if you have a
human civilization you're probably
compartmentalizing things by uh
occupation so somebody who's a brain
surgeon doesn't need to know as much
about
feet right so so it kind of makes sense
that brains or you know we think about
brains when we think about education and
brain surgery and you think about the
body when you think about a broken leg
and exercise and stuff like that but I
think that's always been an
artificial uh
distinction in my experience the brain
and the body are just the same thing
meaning that your thoughts are so
controlled by the Exist by the situation
with your body that to say that your
brain is doing the thinking and your
body is somehow
uninvolved is crazy give let me give you
an example if you're hungry you don't
make the same decisions as if you're
well fed that's well understood and plus
you experience it yourself so that's
your body that's your body influencing
your brain if your body is having a fear
reaction your brain's going to make
decisions based on that and sometimes
your body just goes into this fear
reaction without knowing how it happened
if your body is tired or sleepy
completely different decisions and even
different
preferences under those conditions so
it's always a mistake to imagine that
your your brain is this thing operating
independently and then your body is
doing its thing if you don't think of
them as one machine you're really in bad
shape now here's why this is important
yes the Vagas nerve exactly if you're
can relax your Vagas nerve nerve it'll
relax your body and then your brain will
follow so the thing you need to know is
that although your brain can tell your
body to do stuff the normal way your
body is telling your brain what to
do and so I often tell people if they
want to manage their own thoughts they
should do it by changing their
body right let's say you have low
self-esteem change your body you look
look in the mirror and say oh that looks
good or that looks good better than the
people my age or better than the people
I'm competing with you don't have to
look like a movie star but how about uh
you're not feeling interested you're too
bored put your body somewhere outside
your house go do something put your body
in nature put your body out there put
your body in exercise Put Your Body by
healthy food instead of unhealthy food
right so just imagine your body and your
brain are just one device and you manage
them in an integrated way that's what I
say I I'm not sure if you're if your
heart really has memory but I don't rule
it out I wouldn't rule it
out because memory is just a pattern
right wouldn't you say intelligence is
is a pattern so if you could store a
pattern in your
brain is it impossible to imagine there
could be a different kind of storage
mechanism they could store a pattern in
in your other parts of your body I feel
like in concept maybe
maybe so uh here's some bad news and
worse news for New York
City uh the bad news is they have a rat
problem and the the mayor has uh
declared a war on
rats a war on rats that's the bad news
the bad news is that your city has such
a bad reputation with rats that you have
to declare a war on rats other places
can be silent on that question but they
got a war on rats do you know that's the
bad news you know what the worst news is
according to the news today they're
losing the war on
rats yeah bad news you got so many rats
you need a war worst
news you're losing the
war well that's bad news so New York
City not looking so good if I were to
solve this problem I would do a $1
Bounty per rat payable only to uh
illegal
immigrants $1 per rat payable only to
illegal
immigrants solve two
problems no all right all
right
um the uh government of the United
States is doing something smart and wise
and
economical wait a minute hold on I must
have written that down wrong
what I it might be
true this might be
true this is this is weirder than the
aliens 10 foot aliens at the shopping
mall but this might actually be true the
Biden Administration is going strong
on trying to sell our nuclear energy
small small modular
reactors because if we can sell our uh
our nuclear technology and knowhow to
other countries that gives us sort of a
geopolitical control of those other
countries because the last thing you
want is for some third world country in
Africa to say you know what we need some
nuclear power here can anybody help us
and then Russia and China say yeah we
can help like that's our bad situation
because we don't want Russia and China
befriending any countries that could be
our friend right we need all the Allies
allies we can get so the Biden
Administration is doing a big
push exactly the right thing uh to try
to get other countries a little bit
pregnant on American American nuclear
knowhow is that a good
idea it's a great idea in fact I think
the Biden Administration should be
making a much bigger deal about it do
you know why they're
not because half of their base still
thinks nuclear energy is the worst thing
in the world instead of the thing that
will save it yeah so he's doing the
smartest
thing well it's one of the smartest
things I've I've seen a president do
honestly if if Trump were doing this I'd
be praising him from top to bottom and
he didn't so you know I'm being being
honest now I think V would of course
push nuclear he said it even today yeah
you know moments ago he just posted that
we should go hard on Nuclear So I know
if a would get there I think that Trump
could have done more on nuclear power I
was always disappointed on
that however there's only one problem
with this push to get other countries to
buy into American nuclear
knowhow so we're selling these small
modular reactors the kind that you can
make the components in a factory and
while it might be only a third as good
as a regular power plant it'll be way
cheaper uh you know maybe power a
million homes for 60 years so it's
really good stuff if you can do it you
know what the one problem is the stuff
we're selling to other countries doesn't
exist
yeah that's the only
problem so we're trying to get all these
other countries to ignore China and
Russia's existing
technology to
instead invest in our technology that
we've never yet successfully
built nobody in America has built a
small modular reactor we don't have a
company that's ever done that we have
companies trying to do it and they're
they're quite far along but nobody's
ever done it yeah Rolls-Royce has done
it in England but in the United States
nope nope haven't done it now why
probably has a lot to do with our
regulations and poor governance probably
but having said that I think it's a
great idea that we're selling our
nuclear
technology was I joking because what
we're selling is smoke and mirrors no no
if Trump were selling a technology that
didn't exist to other countries on the
hope that it would soon I would say it
was brilliant so I'm going to use the
same standard yeah I mean it's not that
unusual that a company will sell
something they don't
have you know if they think they're GNA
have it
soon it's not that unusual to do this so
I'm gonna give Biden um pretty close to
an A+ on this pretty close to a plus.
now if aake would have done the same
thing maybe even better and I think he
would do it more full throated
whereas Biden is doing the right thing
but I feel like he has to be quiet about
it because he doesn't want to offend his
base because you know what the Democrats
hate more than
anything good
work they hate it they hate
it all right speaking of that um well
maybe things are turning here's another
sign that 2024 everything's going to go
well it goes like this uh Colin rug was
posting about this on X so apparently
the Philadelphia mayor Charelle
Parker uh signed this executive order
declaring a public safety emergency so
Philadelphia is so dangerous now that
they're they're getting really serious
about Law and Order uh she's fully
committed to ending the lawlessness
going to hire 300 more police
officers
and fired their new head of
Dei so Philadelphia fired their Dei
director and just declared an emergency
and said we're going to hire police
officers and fix things how is that for
2024 in like a
lion it's going to be a hell of a year
hell of a year right yeah so even a
deeply Democrat city is saying they
don't say it out
loud but they are saying we're if we act
like Republican we can solve
this doesn't that look like what it is
to me it looks like Philadelphia just
said you know what acting like Democrats
got us here if we act like Republicans
let's see if we can fix it and then they
acted like Republicans hired police
officers and fired their Dei director
that's pure
Republican will it work yeah yeah it'll
totally work absolutely it'll
work
speaking of the disgraced concept of Dei
Mark cubin is doubling and tripling down
in his support for
it um I was going to let it go for a
while Let It Go as in you know not
comment on it on acts at least directly
to Mark Cuban because I didn't think he
meant it like I didn't think he was
serious it just looked like he was
preparing to run for office to
me but the more he writes about at it
the more I think he means it which which
means I had to get
involved because that's not a good uh
it's not a good direction for the
country so I posted to him um the
following um on X today I said uh Mark
literally everyone I can call him mark
because I've talked to him a few times
on on by DMS anyway so I use his first
name Mark literally everyone who has
spent a minute in the real business
world knows de Dei might have been
well-intentioned
but in practice it is pure race
discrimination every time do you think
that's fair is it fair to say that
obviously was well-intentioned
but in the real world no so I gave him a
I said I asked me about the five careers
I've lost so far for being white and
male so I just listed them number one
Crocker Bank quote we can't ever promote
you because you're a white and
male yes management told me that
directly I'm not guessing they said it
to my face directly so I left Crocker
bank and went to Pacific Bell what
happened there seed number one same
thing exactly the same thing management
told me they couldn't promote me because
I'm white in
mail I was back then as
well could have changed but it didn't
number three uh Dilbert was an animated
show that was doing well enough to get
uh renewed on
UPN but UPN decided that Monday night
where that TV show ran they were going
to turn into an all black comedy lineup
and dber didn't fit the all black comedy
lineup so it got moved to a new time
zone and when you move things to a new
Time Zone on TV it usually kills them
which it
did my speaking career which had been
quite robust completely ended when I
backed to Trump in
2016 why was it because I had Republican
leanings no it's because I was a white
guy and I backed Trump I mean it was
just racist yeah yeah there was no
corporate entity that could invite me
because it would be too many people in
their own group who would say why did
you invite a racist and what was the
evidence that I'm a racist that I'm
white it and I and I thought Trump would
be a good
president that's it would that have
happened to a black man I doubt
it how about
uh my recent cancellation in 20123 so I
lost my entire cartoon
syndication and Publishing book
publishing careers you could count that
as two so really it's six
careers
and why why did I get canceled well
here's how I would frame it
um I said that you should stay away from
people who have been taught in school
that you were their
oppressor you should stay away from
people who are learning in
school that you are their oppressor and
their main problem in
life now I'm doubling down and tripling
down on that because everybody agrees
there's literally not a person in the
world who would disagree with that
statement now did I say it in a way that
may have been taken too
provocatively yes I did intentionally I
didn't realize it would lead to my total
cancellation but I was trying to be
provocative but the point is the point
is one we all agree on there's nobody in
the world who wants to spend time with
people who in general have been
literally taught in school that you're
the problem
taught in school that you're the problem
who disagrees that you should stay away
from that group of
people but let me say carefully and
completely you shouldn't discriminate
against
individuals right there's no one
individual who represents you know
anything that's some Universal thing so
don't discriminate against individuals
in hiring or your personal life or
renting or any of that stuff I'm against
that one
100% but as a demographic group can you
say that you should stay away from a
group that been in school as part of the
government officially programs that you
are the problem now you should get the
 away from that as far far as you
can and yeah I'm going to Triple down on
that so anyway
um I saw Elon must say in resp response
to uh Cuban because they've been talking
about this on the xplatform talking
about Dei and mus said that he agrees
that you should you know look for the
right qualifications first but mus said
that if you had a uh let's say a white
candidate and a candidate who would give
you some
diversity that uh even musk would use
the diversity as a
tiebreaker so if I were to apply for a
job
at
Tesla and I had the same qualifications
as a black candidate or somebody else
who they were looking for then Elon Musk
says that he would favor the other
candidate now you know that's racist
right so I'm uh deeply disappointed but
I also agree with
them so I agree with Elon musk's uh
point of view it's super racist but I
agree with that here's why he's taking
it from the point of view of the uh well
I'm I can't read his mind but this is my
best my best estimation of why his
opinion would be what it is um if your
job is to take care of the
shareholders and your job is for your
company to thrive within the legal
bounds of the Constitution and the
country you actually are better off if
you have a diverse Workforce that has
the same level of talent as if you would
not so if you take the white guilt out
of it and you just say can I reduce the
amount of outside pressure I will get
will I make my customers happy will the
Press say good things about my company
and the answer is yes if it's more
diverse so from a business person's
perspective Elon Musk is 100% right if
you had two people who are the same
qualifications
you probably would want to pick the one
that gives you diversity as well because
as Cuban points out and I
agree the diversity can be an advantage
because it gives you you know more
opinions from more places in America
than you would have otherwise but you
wouldn't do it if you were going to lose
something else right if you had to give
up too much to get that extra
perspective then you have to make that
choice which one is the bigger benefit
at Rec cost but I agree I agree with
Elon Musk if you put me in his
position I would do what's good for the
company and the shareholders because
that's my job and I would probably
discriminate racially however let me be
as clear as possible this makes uh Elon
Musk a
racist
unambiguously because he said in clear
language I would favor somebody because
of their race if they had the same
qualification
now if he said I'm going to flip a coin
I would say oh that's fair but he said
he would favor them because of race that
is racism purely racism as an
individual and as a you know citizen of
the country I say you and
that you you Elon Musk for
being a racist and saying it in public
but on the other hand I totally agree
with you I would do the same thing
is that fair can I can I hold those two
opinions
strongly I would do the same thing he's
doing because it makes sense from a
business perspective and frankly it
might even be better for the country
like he's he tends to look at the big
picture yes the big
picture he's probably
right but it's unambiguously racist so
let let's let's not we don't have to
sugarcoat it it is
racist by definition I mean it's the
cleanest clearest complete racist thing
you could possibly do might be good
might be good for the
country but probably
not you know what the real problem is
the real problem is there's no such
thing as two people have the same
qualifications that's not a real
thing so it might be that we're not
really even talking about anything real
have you ever met two candidates who
have the same qualifications you said oh
these are equal there might be people
you can't tell the
difference but they're never the same
you just can't tell so maybe that ends
up the same all right
um apparently the effort to keep Trump
off the
uh off the ballot because of his
Insurrection ways is now been extended
to a whole bunch of other members of
Congress so there's this former
Congressional
candidate who uh he's famous for hating
magga he's uh trying to use that same
14th Amendment to
disqualify uh one other candidate Perry
but then there's somebody else trying to
qualify 126 members of Congress all
Republicans because they somewhat agreed
with the J the January 6
protesters now
have you ever seen anything like this
where one party is trying to remove
people from the ballot for reasons that
are obviously
 and we got this far now I think
none of that's going to be
successful but it's pretty
amazing oh my I let me tell you the
comments coming from Rumble are a
different character than the comments
coming from uh
YouTube oh
my anyway so uh Jonathan Charley writes
about the uh Insurrection play that the
Democrats are doing now I've never seen
anything as anti-democratic as that what
is more anti anti-democratic than
keeping candidates off the ballot for
 anyway Bill lman continues to
stir up trouble so you know bill lman
was the or maybe one of two main people
pushing to get the Harver president
fired and she eventually did resign but
then he was going he's also going after
MIT and uh I guess there are people and
business insiders going after him so
Business Insider went after Bill amman's
wife for some academic work in which she
had not uh done proper attributions
because he was going after president of
Harvard for plagiarism so a Business
Insider said that we we'll look at your
wife is that fair is it fair to look at
a guy's wife because you don't like what
he
said uh
no no that's not fair that's not fair at
all because it's not like it's politics
or or something else you know else
wouldn't have been Fair if Bill Amman
had gone after the president of
Harvard's husband for
plagiarism what do you think I would
have said about that I would have said
Bill Amman you're being a dick if you go
after the president of Harvard for
plagiarism that makes sense because you
know that's a job that is supposed to
protect against plagiarism but if you
went after the spouse even if I don't
like what the spouse did that's not a
fair attack that that's that's another
domain and when I watch Business Insider
go after Bill amman's wife I say Bill
amman's wife wasn't involved she didn't
say a peep about any of this she's not a
politician she's not a politician's
wife that is completely unfair attack so
what did Bill akman do he's forming a
group to look after look into the
Business Insider writers to see how much
plagiarism they've
done so now it's full out War it's just
full out
War who's going to win if it becomes a
full out plagiarism War who's likely to
win the left or the right
well the the world of academic writing
is probably five or 10 to one populated
with Democrats so they should have five
to 10 times as much
writing and if everything were equal on
both sides in terms of rate you would
five five to T times more uh plagiarism
just because there's more
writing
so game on Business Insider you just
took on the
uh the probably the most dangerous man
in American Business and he's going to
put you out of business I think
maybe all
right um so then he went also went after
MIT Bill akman did
so there's a chairman so a chairman of
MIT his wife has some nonprofit and they
did some clever thing that only a person
like Bill akman could untangle so they
did something with a charity that
doesn't look on the surface like it's
the most legitimate thing in the world
that did some kind of clever tax
manipulation that bill Amman says might
have been
illegal might have been illegal so so
could you remind me if this ever comes
up could you remind me never to start a
public fight with Bill
lman please if you ever see me like
leaning in that direction for any reason
I have no reason but if you ever saw me
can you can you just grab me by the
collar and just pull me back like Scott
this isn't going to work out for you
don't don't do it but I love watching it
since I'm not
involved
and more evidence that everybody
including me or even especially me was
wrong about
fedman he says the Border crisis is a
crisis what Democrats can say that
apparently you can right out loud um he
said that when he went to Harvard
Harvard was always a little Pinko but
now he doesn't recognize it
what
what okay it sounds like a republican uh
he's also a full-throated supporter of
Israel and he's not a big fan of the uh
people talking about colonizers which he
calls out calling them colonizers he
goes like where does this come from it
must be Tik Tock he hates Tik Tock too
come
on come on Federman Federman is
pro-israel anti- Tik Tock uh thinks
Harvard is going full Pinko and the
Border crisis is a
crisis
you know what else I watched a clip of
him describing it it actually looks like
he
recovered he looks recovered like when
he talks I thought his uh his fluency
was
good good now I don't agree with him on
all of his
policies but he's the real
deal like I I don't want to walk away
from or
yeah I just don't want to walk away from
something that's
real I totally see his appeal now I
absolutely completely see his appeal now
now I'm not sure that's why he got
elected I think he got elected just for
being a Democrat but he has some skill
I'm going to give him that I don't think
he's president
material but he could surprise you
someday Sam mman said something useful
here about uh you know the AI speed at
which we adopt it so Sam Alman you know
head of open AI he says stasis is a myth
stasis meaning staying where you are
everything's moving all the time right
so there's no such thing as staying in
one place so you could say you want to
but it's not really a choice you nobody
can stay in one place the world is
changing too much all the time but he
says this uh the fight for a future is a
struggle between Tech technological
driven growth and managed
decline wow now that's sort of setting
up the you know the fake Choice a little
bit but it does make the point well he
says the growth path has inherent risk
and challenges along with its fantastic
upside and the decline path has
guaranteed long-term disaster
stasis staying where you are is a
myth so what he didn't say but I think
is implied
that if the United States decided to
slow down on
AI just to make sure we're going safely
our competitors
won't China
won't right so we would guarantee that
this key technology you know we go
behind that would I think I would agree
with him that would guarantee a a
managed
decline that would be like not
trying now I agree with him completely
on the risk analysis and I think people
in general are bad at risk analysis
which is why we often get the wrong
answers the risk analysis is exactly the
way he described
it yes there's a risk of all technology
there was a risk with smartphones and I
think we're paying it I think we're
paying a pretty big price for
smartphones there was a risk of you know
uh windmills would eat your birds and um
solar cells would be hard to recycle and
you know basically everything everything
that's progress also has a big risk
involved so if you say the AI has a big
risk you're right and it might even be
bigger than the other risks it might
actually be existential you're right but
not doing it guarantees you go out of
business not doing it guarantees you
become a third world country in the end
so it's not really a hard
choice if if you have a let's say A you
feel you have better than 50/50 chance
of making AI work without killing you
that is a way better chance than not
doing it at all and letting China have
ai I mean that's the end of
everything so yeah now on top of that
it's not just worrying about
China because people are building AI in
their
basements right we already have the
tools that an individual could build an
AI which is already happening
and you can't stop it so the idea of
artificially slowing down our
companies it doesn't really make sense
from a riskmanagement uh perspective now
let me be clear if AI gets out of
control and destroys America Am I
Wrong is my opinion wrong if five five
years from now America is destroyed by
AI the answer is no it was still the
right bet it's just not every bet is
going to be a winner but in terms of
guessing what's the right way to go this
is definitely the right way to go you
want to be a little bit aggressive at
least in AI there's no way Revenue
because if you take the we don't want to
be dead in five years you've guaranteed
your dead in
10 so I'll take a 50 I'll take a 50%
chance of surviving over 100% chance of
failing that that's just basic
risk management that's not even an
opinion that's just risk management it's
just numbers it's just
math of course you'd have to believe
your your own assumptions to do the math
all right let's talk about B Biden's
hate of speech uh so dementia Hitler I
like to call him dementia Hitler gives a
speech and of course his staff was quite
aware that if they gave him a background
that looks satanic that people like me
would say hey that's speech looked
satanic like his last one so you know
how they fixed it they put solid
American flags behind him so that from
every angle there would be an American
flag behind him so that it didn't look
like
Satan so dementia Hitler gets up there
and starts talking
like Hitler kill all the magas or
whatever he said he's all all these
flags behind them so do you think think
that uh
Biden may have the Dei problem that he's
trying too hard for diversity and if you
try too hard from The Limited pool of
people available you might end up with a
competency
problem yeah do you know what the
problem with putting all American flags
behind Biden is does anybody know the
problem with that I bet his staff
doesn't know the
problem there is a problem do you know
what it
is now I'm not sure that science is born
out but in this book persuasion by Chini
he's also the author of influence the
most important book on persuasion ever
read right so this is this is somebody
who works on Democratic campaigns until
recently I think he's retired from
politics so he's actually advised Obama
uh we think he advised Clinton all right
one of the things in his book is that
they did a test of how people are primed
the persuasion part is about priming
people uh if they see an American flag
do you know what the result was American
flags make people vote
Republican because the American flag is
the symbol of
patriotism when you say
patriotism who do you think
of even if you don't like Republicans
you kind of think okay they're they're
the flag waivers the Republicans are the
flag people they're the ones who don't
want you to burn it Democrats are the
ones who might be okay with burning it
Republicans no don't burn my flag
Republican most likely to put a flag
outside their House Republicans most
likely to go to a protest holding an
American flag Democrats most likely to
go to a protest
holding Palestinian flag Mexican
flag right
so um I think that Biden staff failed
him again and I totally get that they
wanted to make the background look not
satanic but they made it look Republican
instead will that get Biden any
Republican votes because he has Flags
nope
nope will it make people think huh it
looks like he's agreeing with the
Republic Republicans and I feel more
Republican because I saw some Flags well
it depends if you believe the
research you know the research is in the
field where I'm not sure it's it's not
like physics where you can prove it's
true sometimes it'll be different
opinions so the research might be
sketchy but uh yeah I think the American
flag was a weirdly it was a mistake it
was actually a staff
mistake so anyway uh dementia Hitler as
I call him is angry and uh unstable and
chaotic and he does look like Hitler in
other words I only see hate when he
talks was that your take the the look on
his face and the way he presented and
the way you talked about those magga
people to me it looked like
hate why would you ever vote for
somebody who hates a big part of the
country his own
citizens hate so it was a uh dark hatred
filled dementia Hitler kind of a
presentation in which he threaten people
like
me yes I feel that he literally
threatened me threatened because he
bragged about putting the January 6
people in jail and now there is a legal
ruling that you could be jailed simply
for passively being
there uh there was a recently a case in
which
uh there was a guy named Alfred who was
part of January 6 he didn't do anything
he was just sort of there and he can be
and he didn't do any VI anything violent
or destructive doesn't seem to be the
incited anybody to do anything he was
just there and the court said DC DC of
course uh Neel nevertheless we affirm
his conviction because a jury could
rationally find that his unauthorized
presence in the capital as part of an
unruly mob contributed to the disruption
of the congress's Electoral
certification and jeopardized the public
safety that's a real
thing he he's being convicted his
conviction is being
appell even though they acknowledg that
his only crime was to be in an
unauthorized
place and that's good enough because his
participation gave gave cover or support
to insurrectionists do you know who
else's activities give cover and support
to insurrectionists according to this
standard me
me right me so by by doing this right
now talking in public in support of the
protesters I am part of a larger
operation which you could reasonably
assume according to this legal standard
that somebody like me is guilty of
insurrection or at least guilty of uh
being part of destabilizing the
government through my
opinions yeah now there obviously they
they have not extended the standard to
people like me but I feel it
I feel when uh when dementia Hitler
brags about how many people he put in
jail for January 6 he's telling people
like me not to
complain in the country that's supposed
to have my back on Free Speech because I
feel like I become part of the
insurrectionist just by saying it's a
hoax it's a hoax by the
way January 6 was
HS because Republicans do not do
insurrections with their guns
um Glenn Greenwald who is dunking on Joe
Biden he says Joe Biden is so deeply and
passionately devoted to the urgency of
democracy that he's doing everything
possible to imprison his leading
opponent criminalize his movement the
Maga people and as federal courts found
censor the
Internet by his anti-democratic measures
are to save
democracy thank you Glenn Greenwald see
this is why you should listen to Glenn
gdal when he disagrees with you you
should also listen to him because he's
capable of disagreeing with both
sides that is an important and valuable
asset that there's even anybody who's
willing to criticize both sides so when
he talks I listen he he is
earned uh my respect even though he
insulted me once on X but I got over it
because he's quite valuable Charlie Kirk
says that uh Joe Biden brags in his j6
Doomer speech I like that Doomer speech
that his doj has targeted 1200 J Sixers
convicted 900 and sentenced them to 840
years of prison
collectively he wants his political
opponents afraid this can happen to them
too what a sick man well it worked
because I am his political opponent and
I'm literally worried about jail
not I'm not kidding I am literally
worried that I could be jailed on a
trumped up
charge is that fair how how many of you
think that's a reasonable thing to worry
about after listening to dementia
Hiller is that
reasonable am I am I overw
worrying we're not there yet you know I
don't live in a world where
yet I could be picked up in the you know
the Jan but you can see it's moving in
that direction you can see he's trying
to widen the envelope to make it any
Mega who supported it's very
obvious yeah I'm definitely a
Target so dementia Hitler uh thank you
for uh walking into the narrow Ravine
where everybody can now see that this is
just the third hoax in a row he runs all
of his campaigns on a big old hoax and
uh well and Hillary's does did
too all
right I'm just looking at some of your
comments
from all right stop using the word
diverse all
right so I'm calling the three big HOA
hoaxes the Russian collusion hoax to
find people hoax in the January 6
Insurrection hoax I'm calling them the
three hoaxen of the
Apocalypse do you like it the three
hoaxen of the
Apocalypse yeah give me a man and I'll
show you the crime exactly
stolen um Trump says that Biden is
fear-mongering so he reacted speech
calling Biden's remarks a quote pathetic
fear-mongering campaign
event uh he said that Biden was only
attacking him on the issue of democracy
because he could not run on other issues
that is correct he's only attacking him
on January 6 because if they don't run a
hoax they don't have enough to get
elected all right it's all about the
hoax now here's the scary part
what is the uh most powerful form of
persuasion what's the most powerful form
of
persuasion fear there's nothing above
fear if you can make somebody afraid you
control them because they have to do
what they have to do to get rid of Their
Fear before they even eat right you
could be really really hungry but if a
bear appears at your campsite you're
going to run first and eat second right
so fear beats
eating if you wanted to like have some
sex but the bear appears at your
Campground you will immediately cancel
the sex to run away right fear just
beats everything now I would argue that
when Trump ran the first time he
successfully weaponized fear about the
Border situation in immigration
now you might say he shouldn't have done
that and I think maybe he overdid it but
it worked because fear is good Persuader
now what Biden's doing is a little
different because he's using fear
persuasion except he's telling half of
the country that they're the target of
the
fear like me so what what do I feel
being targeted as you know he would say
I'm part of Maga even though I never
identify with Maga I've never identified
with Maga in case anybody wonders I just
don't like the name and I don't like to
be a joiner I just like to have my
opinions like I don't I don't need to be
in a club don't put me in the club I
just want to have my own opinions that's
all I
want well so Biden has created
fear in the
Democrats that uh Trump and his Mega
Army is a bunch of non-democratic people
who want something bad I don't know but
by that framing instead of doing what
Trump did and he said there's somebody
outside the country who's a
risk which could in theory unite the
country wait there's somebody outside
the country the illegal immigrants who
might bring in too much crime and that's
a risk oh we could bind together for
that but because Biden's persuasion is
that the Maga people are the
problem that makes me afraid that
another four years of him could end up
with me in
jail so he's activated my highest level
of
self-defense right I I'm in
actual fighting for my life self-defense
mode because of his crazy dementia
fear-mongering
speech now it could be the greatest
mistake anybody ever made made in the
political
realm because you don't want to really
make people like me fight for my life
I'm already doing enough
damage you don't want to make me think
I'm gonna die if I don't do it better
but here we are so I can promise you
this you're going to see my
best because I'm try to stay out of
 jail so I'm not going to take
any
prisoners that this this is a I'm
literally fighting for my life and I'm
going to go all in I'm going all
in got nothing to
lose
um V continues to pick up the free
money um I saw this in somebody else's
post that I copied his words without
giving him credit sorry about that U but
it's the phrase I use a lot also picking
up the free money and
and so he says his top goal is to re
reunite the country now day one he's
going to he's going to pardon the J
Sixers Julian the song Douglas Mackey
and Ross or and I won't wait until the
last day like presidents usually do wait
a minute Ross
Albright why is it going to Pardon
him he he wants to pardon the uh Silk
Road
guy the guy that brings you
fenel now remember I told you I wasn't
going to take any
prisoners
well uh I've actually heard from Ross El
Bright's
mother because I said he should stay in
jail and she thinks I'm persuasive so
his mother basically begged me not to
keep dumping on Ross Al bright and say
he should stay in
jail um
sorry Mom I think you should stay in
jail now I think other people should get
pardoned but I would oppose his his
pardon uh because I'm anti
fenel now you might say to me but Scott
all he did is create a tool what people
do with a tool should certainly not be
his problem no that's a stupid argument
the the Silk Road was made for crime
it was made for
Crime that's why it
exists
no yeah how many people have died
because the Silk Road
exists what do you think how many
innocent people innocent is I guess how
many people died because the Silk Road
exists tell me that and then I'll tell
you uh whether I think he should be
pardoned if the answer is none if the
answer is none
or you know some trivial number that was
a weird weird thing I'd say all right
I'll give him a pardon but the answer is
not none is it can't you buy guns over
the Silk Road Am I Wrong can you buy a
gun over the Silk
Road so a number of you are saying zero
so you actually think zero people died
because Silk Road
exists
apparent there's a lot of people think
that how how about it on this platform
how many of you think the number of
people who were killed by the Silk Road
existing was
Zero Now isn't the Silk Road how people
get fenel and how they get uh weapons
that criminals can't get
legally
all
right you know what I love I love the
fact that people are so addicted to my
morning live stream that if I go over an
hour they get
mad because I feel they can't let they
can't quit you you can stop watching
after an hour if you want you could just
stop
watching no you can do it
I know I know I know you all like to
complete your mission but it you know
it's okay with
me yeah it's okay with me you can murder
somebody and get less time than you
could get for the Silk Road that makes
sense to
me I think you should get more time for
making the Silk Road than you should for
murder if you killed one person that's
just one
murder well that's my opinion anyway
um Nikki Hy who met according to the
hill this is their headline Nikki hilly
dogged by Civil War controversy and they
quote her in the headline I had black
friends growing
up I had black friends growing up now
how did she not
know that that would be quoted exactly
the way it was
quoted she didn't see that coming the
the old I have a black friend so I can't
be a racist thing she didn't see that
coming at all did not see that
coming all right um here's what I like I
would like that the United States could
have a president that is the smartest
person at the
G20 do you think that Nikki hilly who
had a black friend when she grew up
black friends do you think she would
feel like the smartest candidate at the
G20 no I would like a candidate who
would be smart enough not to
say I had black friends when I grew
up V would not say that would he do do
you think V would ever say in public oh
don't call me a racist I had black
friends no did he have black friends I
don't know who knows but it doesn't
matter you don't answer the question
that way that's just dumb it's just
dumb
so um I'll tell you the thing I like
best about this this particular uh
election this is the first election
where I didn't have any doubt that the
candidate I endorsed is the smartest one
running that feels good you should try
it if you're not endorsing the you
should try seeing how it feels to know
for sure that you endorse the smartest
camp
debate it feels really good it feels
really good now I think Trump like I say
don't don't compare Trump to anybody on
any Dimension he's just his own thing
and there's nothing like it and he is
what he is because of the complete the
completeness of him right so you
wouldn't take one quality from someone
else and say oh is this better or worse
than Trump's one quality that's the same
no cuz Trump is what he is because the
combination of things that nobody has
right so comparing by a quality is a
dumb thing in his case but I really like
having the smartest candidate backing
the smartest candidate all right that's
all I got for you YouTubers and Rumblers
and
onx and thanks for joining I'm G to say
something to the locals people after we
go
all right a lot of funny comments here
bye for now thanks for
joining
