well
i was gonna say good morning but uh one
of us is late
it's me
yeah i'm the late one you're right on
time but i'm late
but do you think that will stop us
from having the simultaneous sip
no
no
we're still going to have it
and it's going to be awesome
probably the best one you've ever had
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tank or chelsea steiner canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day this special
thanksgiving version of the simultaneous
sip
yeah it's happening now go
that's right josephine you can't quit me
you're addicted so am i
well all right let me give you just a
little uh
little uh preview of what happened this
morning i was all ready to go this
morning
um my notes were ready and i was getting
ready to fire it up
but
life got in the way so we had a little
a little uh temporary crisis which is
now averted everybody's everybody's fine
it all worked out you don't need to hear
the details
let's just say everybody's fine that's
all you need to know all right
um
can i give you a uh
christmas purchase recommendation
would you like a uh idea for something
to buy
so
i've talked about these before these are
uh bose headphones over the ear
headphones and they're really good but
i thought they were good until i tried
their upgraded one i think it's the bose
700 model or something like that
these are the best headphones i've ever
experienced
i mean
it's just shockingly good now they're
they're really overpriced
uh he has something cheap please yeah
this is this is for you know a spouse or
somebody important
but here's another clever thing they did
can you see that they tell you which one
is the right side and the left and you
say to me well but they all do that
do they
here's the other one
here here's the last model
do they
somewhere i think usually like if you
use braille you can find a little r
somewhere
but they fix that
so
good recommendation
uh
really seriously it's the best
headphones i've ever experienced for
sound
all right let's talk about some newsy
things
do we want to talk about news is anybody
even in a news
mind today
happy thanksgiving by the way
happy thanksgiving
um and we'll talk about uh what we have
to be grateful for in a minute
all right uh here's the fake news play
of the year
and this was so clever by cnn that i'm
actually impressed
now you might know that when bad news
comes out or news that's counter to
somebody's narrative they usually wait
till a friday
or a holiday to release it did you know
that
everybody knows that right that if
there's bad news they wait for a holiday
or a friday so that there's just not
enough time to chatter about it
so
what did uh cnn decide to publish
on thanksgiving
maybe one of the
slowest days of the year for news
uh there's a new study about the arctic
ocean
finding out that apparently the melting
started
decades before they thought
do you see where i'm going
the warming started
decades
sooner as in
before humans had made that much
difference
now
there are two quotes in here
that i think tell you everything you
need to know about the fact that they
learned that the ocean had been warming
well before
before humans had completely kicked up
their co2
now there was there was already you know
industrial production and stuff so there
was co2
humans were producing it but listen
listen to these two takes
from the cnn article published on
thanksgiving you ready
here's one from an expert
this expert said maybe the ocean is even
more sensitive to co2 than we thought
because they're saying gosh
it was already getting warm when it was
only a little bit of co2
so maybe it's more sensitive to co2 than
we thought
that's cognitive dissonance you see it
right
can you all see that
that's the most ridiculous thing an
expert ever said
the entire idea of climate change
has to do with the fact that they have a
pretty good idea
how much co2 does what
that's the whole theory
the whole theory
is that this much co2 will give you this
much warming etc and now this expert has
the gall
to say huh maybe the ocean is even more
sensitive than we thought
not a little bit
it would be a lot
so at the very least
the climate models have been debunked
if this is true i mean if this study
holds up
at the very least the models have been
debunked but
not debunked in the way you think
opposite
it would be much worse
if this is true
and that that yeah and i don't think it
is but if it's true that the climate is
way more sensitive to co2 than we
thought
well we're all doomed those models
actually under
underrepresented how bad it will be
by lot
but that doesn't seem right does it
um
here's another take from another expert
in the same article all right so one
expert says huh maybe the ocean is more
sensitive to co2 than we thought here's
a counterpoint from somebody named musha
atielo he said
it's not clear how much of a role
if any
human caused climate change played in
the early arctic warming so not not
today but in the early arctic warming
and more research is needed
those are pretty much opposites aren't
they here are your two experts
and one said oh it looks like that co2
is really
making a difference early and the other
one's saying
uh i don't think there was much role of
co2 there we'd better find out where
this warming is coming from
now
am i correctly interpreting this as
debunking climate science
what do you think
i would say it does not debunk the big
picture
i don't think it does that
because i do think that there are
probably enough ways you can test co2
and doesn't raise the temperature etc
but it does say
there's some enormous variable
that we were unaware of
like enormous
like
changes everything
yeah
so
i don't think it's a coincidence now the
study came out uh yesterday so it would
make sense that today would be the when
the news publishes it
but i've got a feeling that the authors
of the study
may have had something to do with when
it came out you know what i mean
it may be a study they didn't want
anybody to see
because it really does punch a hole in
at least our modeling of climate science
if not the danger itself
from the human part this would actually
suggest that the danger might be more
just just so i'm clear
if this new data is
accurate and it stands up it would
suggest that the problem might be way
worse than we think
so even though it's debunking
climate science
and the models i would say
it's not telling you you're a dangerous
doesn't say that so just to be clear
there's nothing here that would tell you
you're out of danger
rob reiner you all know him
hollywood
icon and doesn't like too many things
that happened on the right here's what
he tweeted
yesterday an underage kid illegally
takes an assault rifle across state
lines
kills two people and injures another
then is welcomed with open arms at
mar-a-lago by the leader of the
republican party a mentally ill racist
this is where we are god help us
this poor bastard
his new sources are so bad
that he thinks that there was something
about an illegal gun in this story
does he not know that the the charges
were dropped because they didn't even
they couldn't even think of a gun law
that it violated
even when there were charges about the
gun
nobody could identify any law that had
been broken even though there were
charges
so when it got you know down to crunch
time they dropped the charges because
why
there's no applicable law
there's no law that he broke
so the left
still believes
still as of today
believes that an illegal gun is a big
part of the story because of course
that's the narrative
so um
you have to be really really uh poorly
served by your news sources to believe
that that was an illegal gun or that it
came went across state lines because
neither of those things happened
all right the biden administration
is putting the screws on china and
blacklisting some more companies
so i'm going to say good
by the administration keeping the
pressure on china i don't think it's
nearly enough
can't be happy about it but at least
directionally it's okay
um
i'm gonna give you a primer story and
then a story
okay so the first one's just a primer
for what what comes after because you
know how you
how you accept
some new information has to do with how
you're primed to a large extent
here's the primary story
there was a uh a black man who was
released from prison served 16 years for
a rape he did not commit
did not
16 years in prison
and here is the evidence that convicted
him so
it's an author
famous author alice siebold who said she
got raped when she was younger
and
she said that she was walking down the
street and saw this gentleman who did go
to jail
and said that
she thought it was him
so she identifies this guy just like a
random guy walking down the street
and then i guess she couldn't pick him
out of a lineup later
but somehow that was still good enough
but they had one other piece of evidence
placing them there which was a piece of
hair
later we found out that the technique
they used to study their hair was wrong
ninety percent of the time
90
90 of the time it was a wrong wrong uh
analysis
so the only thing they had is a
personal identification which everybody
knows is
super bad especially when it's
cross-racial
right white people trying to identify a
black man
immediately you got problems right if
it's a stranger
and
so
so that's the stories a completely
innocent black man went to jail for 16
years
on the strength of science
and white lady identification
now this was 16 years ago he went to
jail right
so that's your primer story
in case you're wondering
do black people have anything to
complain about
yeah
yeah
look at this i'm sorry
look at this story
they got a lot to complain about
however
however
this was 16 years ago
has anything changed
well i'm sure innocent people are still
going to jail
hopefully less
but you know i'm sure it hasn't changed
that much all right but that's just your
primer we'll get to the second story
that's also a primer
um you saw some of the uh
social media
commotion because the news is treating
the
the gentleman who is also black
who drove the suv into the crowd and
killed killed some people in waukesha
and the way that's being reported by the
washington post is
that it was caused by an suv
that the tragedy was caused by an suv
what
caused by an suv
no it was caused by a man
who happened to have a car
right
and
um
presumably
because times have changed
maybe a little bit too much
that there's so much sensitivity about
even
mentioning the you know ethnicity of the
driver
which which to be fair should not be
doesn't have anything to do with the
story that i know of now he was
considered a racist and he did kill
white people but i don't know that that
had anything to do with it i mean that
might have been
he might have been just somebody who
runs over people and
also somebody who's a racist
so
that's your second primary story that
the news is treating this perpetrator as
if somehow the car did it themselves i
mean not really but the way they write
it they are so softening the
responsibility here
all right now here's the story
those were primer stories
and this will give you an idea how
things have changed
so you all know you all know the uh
verdict in the uh
ahmed armory arbory case so this 25 year
old black man who was fatally shot when
he says he went for a jog but apparently
he was not wearing
jogging clothes
do do a fact check on me because i
haven't watched this one
as carefully as some other things all
right
so if i get a fact wrong let me know
but uh so three white men uh thought
that he'd fit the description of
somebody who'd
rob some stuff in the neighborhood
burglarized and so they went after him
with at least one gun that was the fatal
one that shot him and they got into it
and they trapped him with the cars and
they they tried to do a citizen's arrest
i guess amud at one point grabbed the
barrel of the gun
at which point the person holding it
pulled the trigger in the struggle and
and killed them
now uh all three people were found
guilty of various
life sentence type
um problems
murderous stuff
now
um yeah
now first of all number one is anybody
here think he was a a jogger
nobody believes that right it's not
relevant
i mean as far as i know it's not
relevant to the crime is it
i mean i don't think you should be
all right but it could tell you you know
about his intentions which might i mean
like i guess you could imagine that it
would make the citizens arrest more more
appropriate
but it shouldn't matter
because whether it was the right guy or
the wrong guy
what happened happened right it didn't
matter who he was what happened happened
so
um and i've seen the let's see i i've
seen a number of people say that the
jury got it right
uh let me pull you right here did the
jury get it right for those of you who
yeah he didn't steal anything so he took
nothing
and he was accused of walking through or
trespassing i guess
in a construction site which
uh when i built my house
i'm looking at your answers coming
across when i built my house
my neighbors all i think they all toured
through the construction site at one
point or another it's pretty common
so i'm not going to say he's guilty of
anything for looking at a construction
site
because
what the hell are we seeing this steal
from a construction site
he didn't have a car
and what are you going to carry away
plywood
i mean i think he was just looking
around
a lot of people do that
and i don't know about the jogging part
i mean he might have been out for a walk
not a jog i don't know
but
none of that seems to be too terribly
important
to the actual alleged crime here all
right so i saw a bunch of different
opinions
whether he was guilty or not but i also
heard
in the news a lot of people saying you
know
11 white people on a jury
and they still convicted these white
guys
so justice was done
how many of you would say justice was
done
in your comments do you think justice
was done
because it was a
mostly white jury 11 and a 12.
and he got they got convicted and they
convicted white guys of killing the
black guy justice is done
well why why are some of you saying no
give me a hint
give me just you know a few words on
um somebody says not enough information
scared
well i have questions
so maybe somebody can help me with these
questions
number one we all agree that
ignorance of the law is no no excuse
right
if you thought something was legal
but or or you didn't you just didn't
know there was any law one way or the
other
and you committed a crime you still go
to jail right
now unfortunately
even though your
your
sense of fairness might not like that
unfortunately
the system has to work that way
because otherwise everybody would say
well i don't know
i didn't know
i didn't know you couldn't murder
anybody you know you would get all kinds
of crazy people saying well who knew i
didn't know
so you pretty much have to have a system
that doesn't let you use that excuse
would you agree
that you really couldn't
couldn't have a system unless you don't
let people say oh i didn't know it was
illegal
but
what about a system
where the people knew the law
what about the people there's no
ignorance here
what about people actually knowing the
law
and then in their own judgment
completely knowing the law
they observe their own actions and they
say i know the law and i know my actions
and i didn't see a problem
my actions did not break the law
what about them did they go to jail
suppose somebody else says they broke
the law
but in their own opinion they didn't
because they also know the law and they
know what they did they didn't break the
law in their opinion
do you go to jail for that
well yes right
you do don't you
let me ask you this
i suppose the uh
uh let's say the uh and i realized this
you know i'm mixing together felonies
and non-felonies and stuff but just
think this through
if the speedometer of your car was
defective
and you and it was let's say it was off
by 15 miles per hour
and you got a ticket
but somehow you could prove later
that your
your speedometer was defective and let's
say the court actually believed it maybe
there was a a recall
so so you say look at the recall the
recall says
this is what these speedometers do they
show you 15 miles over the
would would you be just as guilty
for believing the speedometer
even though you couldn't have known
would you be guilty now i realize this
is a much more minor case
i see mostly yes i see a no i don't know
how many of you are
who are lawyers
i don't know but what is but
would it feel fair
so forget about whether it was legal or
not
you're the judge and you know for sure
that the speedometer was broken
what do you do if you're the judge
you know the speedometer was broken and
nobody got hurt
what would you say
i don't know i feel like the judge would
give him a break don't you or or maybe
the cop would whoever you know once they
found out that there was a real problem
but here's my problem with the three uh
people who got convicted
i saw no evidence of their internal
thinking
that was problematic
now i think they made a horrible mistake
more than one
and i think that if if the family were
to sue them if they had any money i
think that they would be held
responsible
but i can't see the crime they committed
is it just me
now here let me let me give you a
comparison to the alec baldwin thing
so this is sort of a gun owner's view of
things
i saw a lot of people say hey it's not
alec baldwin's responsibility because
the armorer checked the gun and said it
was fine
so it's not his responsibility and then
everyone who actually owns a gun said
what the hell are you talking about
everybody who owns a gun says no if your
finger is on the trigger
there's nothing else to talk about right
if you have a gun in your hand and your
fingers on the trigger and you aim it
and you pull the trigger
no gun owner is going to listen to an
argument about how that's somebody
else's fault
right
so far you're with me right
um
but this is one of those situations
because i
i don't think that alec baldwin should
go to jail do you
i think the responsibility was
absolutely his
he may not you know maybe there's no
lawsuit that can touch him but i don't
think he should be arrested for that
does anybody think that alec baldwin
should be arrested
when he couldn't have known he was going
to be doing that although his
i'm seeing some yeses from peter
uh yes yes
okay
you know if if you want to be tough
tough on uh gun use i think that's fair
enough
all right here's my thing
i'll give you my bottom line on this
thing to me it looks like a a huge
racial
or racist
outcome
does anybody else have that
it's being
most people are reporting it as a
victory for lack of racism
but to me it only looks incredibly
racist like full-on racist as racist as
you could be
am i the only one who sees it
because let's reverse this
would it have gone the same way if the
ethnicities have been reversed
i wonder
now like alec baldwin here's my opinion
of the person who had the gun in his
hand
his fault
the the person who had the gun brought
the gun
brandished the gun pulled the trigger
it's his fault
all right
but
was it illegal
because i don't see a crime
exactly
now
manslaughter
i don't know
weren't they convicted for murder not
manslaughter right
correct me if i'm wrong wasn't it murder
it wasn't manslaughter was it
now let's say let's say that they
believed
that he was or probably was or could
have been
the burglar
do you believe that he that they
believed that he was maybe a burglar
i do i believe that they believe that do
you think that they thought they were
doing something that was not only legal
but pro-legal
i do
i think that they thought they were
doing something that wasn't just legal
it was extra legal like they were doing
extra
as if they were doing the police the
police job for them
legally
because they could do a citizen's arrest
now how do you do a citizen's arrest if
you don't stop the person temporarily
you know wasn't that the
imprisonment charge or something
and if you didn't have a gun why would
they stop
now
go look at georgia law
okay that's not helping me as much as
you think it did
they did not comply with the statute but
is that what they got charged with
did they get charged with not complying
with the statute
now suppose nobody had been killed
it wouldn't have been a big problem
would it
i mean
i guess it would be
an awful thing that anybody had a gun
pointed at them especially if they're if
they were innocent
but
if it had just been a citizen's arrest
would we be having this conversation
somebody says call the damn police well
i'm not going to defend the wisdom of
what they did
so hear me clearly on that
i think i think that at least one of the
three and you could argue all three are
responsible
i think
that that level of responsibility
requires you know some
some legal recourse but i feel like it
should have been
a lawsuit
it doesn't feel like they knew they were
committing a crime it looks like they
were trying as hard as they could not to
commit a crime
doesn't it
so if you know the crime you're trying
as hard as you can to not commit it
and then by your own account i think i
succeeded here's the law here's what i
did
pretty good i don't think i violated it
but they might be wrong
do you go to jail for life
for that
now i heard uh heard has said that there
were 11 white jurors and therefore
um they weren't probably weren't
intimidated and you know they just
believed the evidence went that way
do any of you believe that
it's 21 if there's one i don't know what
the ethnicity of the other person was
was the other person black
if there's one black
citizen on the jury
it's 20 21 all the other 11 white people
are just going to cave
you know that right
don't you all know that
there was only one vote
if it was a black juror
so somebody says it was a black jeweler
yeah if it was 11 white people and one
black juror in 2021
there was only one juror there was the
the black juror
because the other 11
we're going to cave
because it's 20 21. go back to the 60s
of course that's not going to happen
i think in the 60s they probably would
have been freed or something which also
would have been not justice
so
um
your mind reading do you say more about
that what in my mind reading
because i think everything i'm saying
was either in evidence or a reasonable
assumption
that would get you off on a you know
reasonable
doubt um
also was he or was he not a burglar i
don't think that matters
actually it might matter to how you feel
about it but it doesn't matter to the
crime
or alleged crime
uh mind reading the juror intent oh no
i'm just telling you i'm i i'm not
reading the jurors intent
so let me be more clear about this i'm
saying
conceptually
do a uh
do a mental exercise
and put yourself in the room
i think you're gonna cave
most people would
so
i don't think that the jury was fair
um and now maybe there was no way to
have a fair jury under this circumstance
so i don't think had anything to do with
the fact that there was one black person
on it but i don't i just don't think you
could get a fair jury
right now on a topic like this
um
so i'm going to say that the white guys
certainly are responsible for the death
because they brought the gun one of them
had his finger on it
i don't know you know regardless of what
the law is
i don't want to go all
stephen colbert but regardless of what
the law is
uh
there's certainly responsibility if not
broken laws
um
so i guess i don't like anybody in this
story i don't like the three white guys
who chased this guy down and made some
huge blunders
and uh
you know well i'm not gonna say i don't
like the the victim uh i don't know
anything about him except he had some
yeah he had a sketchy past but
i'm not gonna speak poorly of him but i
will speak uh well of his father
did you see that amud arbury's father
said
we
all lives matter did you hear that
he said it loud and he said it clearly
he said it doesn't matter your ethnicity
i'm paraphrasing
you know nobody's nobody's parent wants
to go through this
here's what this feels like
a little bit of a jesus moment
let me explain
let me explain
here's what i feel like happened
i feel that that jury convicted these
three white guys
as almost
like jesus dying on the cross
now it's an analogy so don't get this is
nothing about religion just an analogy
here's what i mean
i feel like
what it looks like is white people
sacrificed white people
because they didn't want to live in a
world like this anymore
and i'm not sure that they looked at the
law
you feel me
i feel like these white jurors they may
have been influenced by the one one
black juror i don't know how you could
not be how could how can you not be
influenced by that really
um
i feel like
a white jury
sentenced white people almost then of
guilt
or something
and i feel like that when you watch this
happen you see white people throw white
people under a bus
maybe for this maybe for the collective
sins of our past i don't know
but the weird thing that this triggered
was for ahmed arbury's father
to say the most awesome thing that
anybody said in a year
which is
all lives matter
in this context he said that
in this context
he said that out loud
and in public
wow
so here's my i guess i'll summarize this
by saying i don't think that
the legal system
was accurate
in this
trial i do think
something like justice happened maybe
too much
i'm not sure life sentence was the right
right answer
uh but they had some responsibility
and i do think
that there was at least a little feeling
of
a sacrifice
it looked like a human sacrifice to me
and it looks like it worked
when you see amud aubry's father
saying
basically he wasn't complaining about
white people at that moment was he
i think it
worked there might be something going on
it feels like it i mean maybe i'm too
optimistic because it's thanksgiving or
something but
it feels like there's some kind of
awakening going on
you know certainly the
the ridden house case a lot of people on
the left found out that their news was
completely fake
but i think we may also be in the
process of finding out that the country
was not nearly as racially divided as
the news was
and
and you know they're the pundits
so
um
well anyway
i think cnn referred to it as a obvious
brazen murder or somebody did an obvious
brazen murder
i i didn't see any obvious brazen murder
i saw some people who made really bad
mistakes
but they certainly thought they were
following the law and thought they were
promoting the law
by doing
doing the officer's work basically
so
i don't know i i would i would think
that in different times
in a different time
i could imagine that they would have
gotten off with the benefit of a doubt
what do you think
let's go back just say 10 years well 20
years let's go 20 years do you think 20
years ago this case would have been
decided the same
no difference between this and lynching
mike berg says
what
correct me if i'm wrong but in lynching
you intend to kill somebody don't you
i would say
that's a difference
mike burt what's wrong with you today
uh
or you
okay that was a very bad pawn i'm not
gonna repeat that
um
now there's also a biden video in which
it's been edited to make it look like
you said and you know he's said out loud
end of quote instead of just reading the
prompter and knowing it was the end of
the quote but it was a video taken out
of context
what happens when i see a legitimate
story
about a biden video being taken out of
context
well i tweet it
because i tag it with
hey it's just like the
fine people hoax and the drinking bleach
oaks and this this gives me a way to
you know
to take these rupert videos and collect
them together and maybe train the people
on the left that their news is is fake
and it has been for a long while
now um i will tell you that the response
online to the whole find people hoax
most people know it's a hoax now or at
least most people
follow me and i follow most of them know
it's a folks
is there anybody on here who doesn't
know that the
the bleach drinking thing was a hoax
that trump never said that
is there anybody who thinks he actually
said that
now i'm pretty sure nobody on locals
believes that but is there anybody on
youtube
uh
who doesn't know that's a hoax
i'm just looking to see it because i
know there's somebody here
somebody says it was a joke no it wasn't
a joke
um
joe rogan pushed it hard what about it
so the
the trump
saying maybe you should drink bleach for
a covid
and don't drink any bleach for coming
you'll die
but you know it didn't happen right
it looks like nobody here is admitting
that they still think that's true
i'm surprised
yeah he never said drink bleach and he
never said drink a disinfectant
and he was talking about uv light the
whole time
on trump's wiki page both hoaxes are
still there
it's funny because
elsewhere on wikipedia you can see it's
a hoax
was this uh reconnaissance is the first
person i heard the bleach hoax from
so i believed it at first
smirkandish
you think smurkonnish believes the
bleach oaks
maybe he did it first because at first
if you saw the video it looked exactly
like you did say that
it's just that it was an edited video a
rupaul
it was a rhupar video
all right i feel like there was
something else that happened today that
i was gonna
talk to you about
uh
i thought he said can we do that not
sure if it could be done yeah he did say
that but of course he was talking about
light
uh let's see what on the first day of
the bleach oaks he was covering it maybe
he realized it was fake after
oh he did believe in it you know but i
but how about now
i could certainly believe that people
would believe it at first
uh
well yeah i'm not going to give you any
more details about the morning adventure
but let's just say
all is well
um
vance will not pursue trump's co oh is
that true is there new uh
new information about the case against
the trump business
wow if they don't go after the coo
it's over right because wasn't the ceo
gonna turn they thought
that means that he doesn't know anything
i think
no charges no charges on the trump
situation
holy cow
and that happened on thanksgiving too
is that a coincidence
is that a coincidence
don't you think that that maybe they
could have dropped those
two on the nose
uh i guess i need to catch up on that
story i can't believe they dropped all
charges are they they're just not
investigated anymore is that true
that can't be true
because i i think they would never give
up
would they
the timing of the release if if it's
true that they gave up on the on the
trump
company charges
and they released that today
that's not a coincidence
uh
please talk about term limits and cuba
economic embargo
you mean the economic embargo that's
been on forever
well term limits there's nothing to say
all the citizens want it
all the politicians don't because it
means they have to go look for a new job
but the politicians get to decide
so that's it
it doesn't matter if you and i want it
we don't get to decide the people who
would be bad for
get to decide so they decide not to do
it
um
trump organizations he also not expected
to be charged all right so
jewel
eldora is sending me
the uh all right so i'm looking at the
news breaking news now
the trump organization as chief
financial officer blah blah
we're charged
uh but
where's the update
uh
is not expected to be charged the ceo
won't be charged
and what about the rest of the case
well
so
is it possible he flipped
that's not possible is it
he's not being charged but does that
mean
he didn't do any crimes
i don't know
uh
huh
all right just looking at it
so
but the probe is not over
right
so there's still they're still probing
uh the trump organization it's just the
ceo won't be part of that it looks like
yeah i don't think he flipped i doubt it
so maybe there's nothing there
you know
a lot of smart people have said if you
look at any billionaires
taxes or business you're going to find
something
i mean it's not a coincidence that as
elon musk said
that billionaires have their own private
audits
i guess there's like a team just for
going after like the billionaires and
audit team
so
so they get it both ways
all right let's go back to comments
i can make this work
bear with me all right
um
i would like to uh tell us what you're
thankful for
i uh
i'll tell you what i'm thankful for
uh
i'm very thankful for all of you
and i say this i say this a lot but i'm
not sure that you believe it because it
sounds like one of those things people
say
but it's really true
because this is such an interactive and
although it's a broadcast it's very
personal
because your comments are coming in at
the same time i'm talking it feels very
personal
and uh you have definitely kept me alive
through the pandemic
um i don't think i could handle the
pandemic without all of you
and i hope that i gave something back
that was you know worth your time
i will be doing lots of
micro lessons on the locals platform
trying to make sure everybody
improves their life substantially
and
uh
we will uh
oh my god
loco valdez richard
thank you for that
um i don't deserve that
but
i enjoy it so thank you
yeah um
even if you annoyed me no you didn't
annoy me
and i can't tell you
how upset i was that i couldn't be here
on time today
you know that right
i don't know if it bothered you
but man it bothered me
it bothered me a lot so i wouldn't do it
if it hadn't been important and i know
you trust me on that
um
the video the clothes hangers got you
through
all right
um
i guess i don't have anything else to
say but uh
well
i i'll tell you it's been it's been a
tough uh week for me
two major uh plumbing leaks i mean like
bad ones
uh
both of our cars are gonna have to be in
the shop
neither of us were driving either car
just bad luck
both of them got uh banged up pretty
badly
and uh
i'll tell you
it's just been uh one plot twist after
another i wish someday i could tell you
you know obviously i can't
like uh if i told you
the stuff that i'm going through at the
same time that you know you're seeing me
do this stuff you wouldn't even believe
it
trust me you would not believe it
so somebody said of me recently
that i seem to be able to handle
a lot of stress
you have no idea
i might be able to handle more stress
than anybody on earth based on my my
track record
yes
trigger down i believe i am
i was asked if i'm an energy monster and
the answer is
yeah
you hypnotize yourself too i did
you get
political news from a cartoonist and
legal news from a bourbon swelling cigar
chomping youtuber
all right i'm just looking at your
comments now because i just enjoy
and enjoy the time here
um
did biden ever release his taxes yeah he
did
thank you vet
all right now for those of you on uh the
youtube channel you can get extra stuff
the good stuff
on the locals uh subscription channel
so if you get a annual subscription it's
only five bucks a month and i guarantee
that you'll get at least a thousand
dollars worth of value every month
so for five dollars i'll give you a
thousand dollars worth of value
and if you don't get that value
you can unsubscribe not much lost
steve says my books
changed your life
who who else would say that
how many people would say that something
i said or did in my books or otherwise
changed your life
it's a lot
you know the first time i ever asked
this question
uh
i was blown away
i had no idea
that the things i was doing were making
that much of an impact i mean i intended
to make an impact but you don't see the
feedback necessarily unless you ask
but i wish you could see on
i wish the youtubers could see the
comments on locals so the people who
subscribed there probably had you know
maybe more effect
uh from
my output but it's almost i mean it's
just a
solid line of people saying they got
something good out of it
um
books helped your business
uh
how much do you bench
um i don't know i don't bench
should i
um
i mean i just i just got a setup in my
garage so i can but
you know i just don't like bench
pressing for some reason i just do
everything else
what's the difference between bench
pressing and
well never mind
you inspired me to open a drug rehab
spring well health
i'll be darned
do you exercise on paw oh yeah it's the
best
exercising on sativa
it's it's just the best
view the world
here with you oh thank you
bench presses messes up your shoulders
it feels like you would i think that's
my problem with it i don't like heavy
weights
oh you listen to the audio version of my
book every six months
are you influenced by stoicism not
directly no
um
how do you find defined stoicism
just as not care not acting like you're
all excited about stuff
uh try dumbbells could be less stress
yeah i use uh
i use individual dumbbells that's
correct
what's sativa it's a
it's the kind of marijuana that's not
indica
so indica is good for getting sleep
and the other one sativa is good for uh
exercise
in fact it makes exercise enjoyable it
takes exercise from oh
to
do you swim for exercise i do in uh in
the summer
set both of your brains on fire
you send your husband and kids
to thanksgiving without using well at
least you have a good book
marijuana lowers testosterone
you know i probably need that
i have too much
uh have you seen sigma grinds i have not
yeah that's what it feels like the
georgia comment i saw there um
uh all right just looking at some of
your
oh i didn't know that
the sativa and the indica come from
different places
makes sense
hey tim
glad you like the show
cat's doing great
um
so yeah cat's doing great
have you ever considered going on with
tim poole yeah i would do that
but you know um at the moment i'm not
taking any any invitations
i just have too much to do
what if q is real
you know
can we finally say that the q people
were wrong about everything do the q
people
not there yet
the fox news had richard painter on to
talk about biden's art
somebody named painter was talking about
his paintings
had to fail as a comic book i don't
think so
um
scott how does one reconcile commitment
to a goal and lack of free will
it's no problem you're going to do what
you're going to do
so you don't have to worry about the
lack of free willing
it's just going to whatever happens is
going to happen
so there's nothing to reconcile
um
how do you like america's trajectory
interesting question
you know
because the news focuses on bad stuff
most of the time
it would be real easy to imagine that
the country's just going to hell
right
all the the wokeness and the riots and
everything else
but
except for inflation which does bother
me
uh in debt same thing really
ah we've never been better
now obviously the mass and the vaccines
are a gigantic pain in the ass but it's
also temporary
now
um
uh i did cover ahmed you you missed it
i'm pretty sure you would have wanted to
see that
based on the way you came at me
um
yeah inflation hurts
hurts pretty much everybody
i don't think it's going to turn into an
endemic
because if i've told you one thing
i'll tell you again
the citizens of the united states are in
charge of the country
as long as we're being asked to do
things that a lot of citizens think
sounds reasonable even if it isn't right
if a lot of people think it sounds
reasonable then people will sort of put
up with it if they think it's temporary
but the moment the government says you
know it's not temporary
the citizens will just take over
so
i'm not worried about this slippery
slope it's a huge inconvenience to all
of us
but the citizens will decide
when we're ready
meaning enough of us
we will take back our country
are you right
you're with me right
when we're ready
we'll take it back do you know why we
haven't taken it back yet
we're not ready
we're not ready
and maybe we won't be
maybe we won't be
because it could you know just take care
of itself right
this is one of those
decisions between wanting and deciding
probably one of the most useful frames
you'll ever hear
what we want
is for the masking to go away
what we want is for more freedom without
vaccine passports am i right that's what
we want
we haven't decided
the same day we decide
meaning enough of us
the same day we decide
it'll happen
but
stop talking to the government
it's not up to them
it's it's your fellow citizens
convince your neighbor
because once we're ready
once we
decide that's it
you know if we're not australia sorry
australia
we're not australia
there's a reason we're armed to the
teeth
do you know what the reason is
that the citizens are armed to the teeth
it's because we're in charge
the ones with the guns are in charge
we're in charge and we will take this
decision
when we're ready just not ready
so all of you who are worried that oh
the government is going to
lock us down forever and whatever
they're doing
you could be afraid of your fellow
citizens
but i'm not worried about the government
the government works for us in this
country in australia the people work for
the government apparently
because the people have no guns so they
have to work for the government
but not here
no
no there there is something about the
american character if you will
that in some ways keeps the whole world
together
and the big part of that american
character is
i'm flexible
i'm very flexible
hey you need something i'm flexible
until i'm not
until i'm not
that's the american character
we are flexible
until we're not
and once we're not get out of the
 way
because
that's like i say to about europe you
know defending yourself from russian
attack or something
europe just needs to get out of the way
if anything goes down like that
just get out of the way
we'll take care of it
brush your teeth and floss your guns
um
if i remember what what was this if
written house turns out bad
did you discuss the botswana
multi-mutant variant yeah now we've got
a new a new variant so let me ask you
this
um
variants are very rare at least the
delta kind they don't happen very often
if another variant pops up at exactly
the wrong time meaning you know the
timing is suspicious
i'm not going to believe these are
variants
i'm going to believe that they're just
being released on some kind of a
schedule i'm just not going to believe
it's a variant because i just don't
think
i just don't think the variants are
going to happen as often as this
and
remember i told you what are the odds
you'd have you know
billions of people with this virus
and you'd get
one bad variant
the delta
that didn't seem suspicious to you
billions and billions of people with all
these mutations and variants and all
that action
just one bad one
what are the odds of that
now if there had been three bad ones i
wouldn't say anything about it we'll go
wow i guess you get bad ones in this
situation
but one
just one
just one bad one
nope i'm not buying it i'm not buying
that that naturally occurred
by the way has anybody else
ever said that i don't know if anybody
else has
said that the fact that there was this
one bad variant
that's a little too suspicious for me
i'm not buying it at all
and not only that but i won't buy it
even if scientists can trace back
like right back to the the freaking bat
if it's a bat or a pangolin or whatever
the hell it is i don't care how much
they can trace and track
the origin of the delta variant if
there's only one
i don't believe it don't believe it
zero i would believe and a hundred i
would believe
am i right
but exactly one
exactly one
no i'm sorry i'm not buying one
now if this botswana thing turns out to
be the second one and maybe there's one
after that then i would start maybe
modify my opinion
and say oh i guess they do come
fairly often
but even now they're coming on schedule
do you believe that variants come
on schedule
that seems a little
a little bit suspicious
um
yeah it's like a subscription to
variants exactly
nice one tech support
um
yeah on on schedule for keeping us
subdued exactly
now how many of you think that it's a
master plan to
train the public to
do anything the government says
how many of you think that's the case
that it's part of the bigger
the bigger plan to
dominate us
yeah i don't think so
all right i'm gonna tell you one uh
embarrassing story about me
and then i'll let you get back to
thanksgiving okay anybody want to hear
an embarrassing story about me
all right
so i'm having some construction done in
the house some
some work done and it's very dusty
and uh the
the gentleman doing the work
um sent a cleaning crew over to
knock the dust off of stuff until they
come back on monday
so the cleaning crew was in the house
just two people two young women
and um
and some groceries got delivered outside
so i went to go get the the groceries
and i was uh
less than happy to find out that
two of the things were these 35 bottle
water
water cases or whatever you call them
grouping of water
now they keep going up from like oh
there's 24 and then it was 32 in a pack
and that was 35.
lifting up a
like one of those things of 35
they're pretty heavy aren't they have
you tried to pick up a
is that what they're called flats would
that be the word um
but here's the good news
i've been working out a lot especially
during the pandemic
and my muscles are actually bigger than
they've ever been
in my whole life i've never been this
fit
and so i said to myself
i'm just going to
grab these things i'm going to toss it
up like i'm a waiter i'm going to walk
past these these two women who are doing
the cleaning in my house and i'm going
to make them think to themselves they
won't say it out loud
but i'm going to make them think to
themselves
damn he's pretty strong
and so i
picked it up threw it over my shoulder
and then i did my best imitation of a
guy who was not using any effort
whatsoever
i just waltzed through
didn't say anything just waltzed through
with a giantly heavy water pack on my
shoulder
put it in the refrigerator felt pretty
good about myself
story's not over
there's more to the story
happen to be looking at my security
camera footage for
some unrelated thing
and saw that the there was a little
video clip there from the gentleman who
delivered the water to my front steps
now what you need to know is that my
front steps are at the top of a
pretty ugly
walk up a hill
yeah so the sidewalk is uphill
and if you're going to carry one of
these 35 bottle water things up that
hill if you're the delivery person
it's it's
kind of not too happy right
so i wanted to see how the delivery guy
handled these two uh flats if you want
to call of water
and let me let me tell you what i saw
he comes walking up the stairs
with one on his shoulder
like he was completely unbothered like
he had two feathers on his shoulder
now you could tell this there was
somebody who did some working out
and
i'm only going to tell you his ethnicity
so you can picture it better right it
doesn't have anything to do with the
story but he was black
and he clearly had been to the gym if
you know what i mean
so
he comes he's got these two big water
bottles on his and he's just walked up
the steepest hill with these two things
and now i say to myself okay okay
show off let's see you put him down
let's see you put him down because this
is going to be this is going to just be
a mess right so he's got these two
magnificently heavy things uh he walks
over and this is how he put him down
he goes
he claps him together and he just sets
him on the ground and he walks away
he clapped them together
clap
now
there was a guy who's moved some
some weight right not only has he been
to the gym but that's a guy who's moved
some furniture you know what i mean
right he knows how to how to move heavy
heavy stuff
so
let's just say i don't think i'll be
showing off my big old muscles carrying
water bottles through the house again
because i that put me in my place pretty
fast
yeah i should have been bench pressing
instead
but the the fact that he had no problem
getting them off his shoulders just made
me practically cry
anyway
um
so i'm gonna go back to the gym and
and try to try to improve on that all
right that's all i got i'm gonna leave
you with that i got to go do some
holiday stuff i want all of you have the
best possible thanksgiving you you can
and i will see you in the morning
unless there's another crisis but you
never know
bye for now
