the highlight of civilization
um and if you'd like to take this
experience up to
stratospheric stratospheric levels
or even words that you can pronounce
or I can all you need is a cover mugger
a glass of tanker cellist or Stein a
canteen jug or flowers a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day thing mix
everything better
it's called simultaneous epidemics now
go
all right how many of you are enjoying
the excellent economics of absolutely
free cryotherapy
yes how many of you can get free
cryotherapy just walking Outdoors right
now
just open the door stand on your front
step
a little bit of free cryotherapy yeah
yeah that's right
uh I just saw a comment from Erica the
excellent there's no way I'm going to
read it
sorry Erica that one will not be shared
and I've got an image in my head now
that will never go away thanks for that
thanks for that
okay I had something to do with somebody
she knows who took an ice bath and when
he was done his nipples were six inches
long now I
I can't I cannot confirm or deny that
that's true I can only tell you it was a
comment I just read that's all I know
that's all I know
all right um so yesterday I decided to
move my live stream off of YouTube and
on to rumble because uh if you're
following my Saga we know now that
um
Twitter had a big influence by the
government the FBI
and we know that they were doing some
kind of throttling that's confirmed and
you know that YouTube's uh
let's say it's relationship with some
creators uh left many questions
so I think it was yesterday or the day
before I got demonetized without any
any explanation
now my feed gets demonetized ordinarily
so it's almost always demonetized but
then we ask for a human review
and the human almost always reverses it
but you've already lost most of your
income
or a big a big chunk I don't know if
it's most but it but it doesn't
demonetize when people are most
interested and it doesn't monetize when
people are most interested in watching
it when it's brand new
like it takes a while for them to
monetize after the big traffic's gone
now
for a long time
I gave them the benefit of the doubt
and maybe I still do which is they they
have an advertising model YouTube does
and that they once explained to me
personally so I got you know YouTube's
personal official explanation of what
was happening to my account
which is that the advertisers don't like
to advertise on some kinds of content
makes sense and so they're really
they're really just doing what they
think the advertisers want them to do
because the advertisers are their you
know their base
so if you just take take the point of
view that all they're doing is managing
their advertising stream of income
than what they do to me makes sense
like you might disagree with that but
it's within the realm of you know an
ordinary business practice
however in the context of what we've
learned about Twitter
and the FBI's acknowledgment that they
work with other entities
um and also the connection between the
FBI and the Democratic Party
I can't really treat I can't really
treat YouTube's treatment of me
as just ad related would you agree
I don't know what's behind it
I mean that I don't know the actual
truth
but within the context of what we know
literally this month like new
information about the government's
interaction with social media I have to
assume that whatever YouTube does to me
is influenced by the government
would you agree
it doesn't mean it's true
I I have no Smoking Gun you know no
direct evidence no whistleblower
but but the pattern recognition is now
so thick
would you agree just based on pattern
recognition that there's just so much
pattern here that how would you how
could you ignore it at this point
so no information
no no
confirming information but what are you
gonna do yeah you have to make your
decision based on
your best guess right because we don't
have perfect information
so I may not be able to get up and
running on Rumble like in 24 hours
because it takes there's a little bit of
setup involved
but my long-term plan
will be to migrate as much of my traffic
as possible off of YouTube
for the benefit of
just making sure the system
is uh let me put it this way
um sometimes I feel like I'm acting as
an individual
sometimes I feel like I'm acting on
behalf of you know followers or
supporters who would like me to do this
or that and sometimes I act as a pure
citizen
and when I'm acting as a pure citizen
I'm acting as part of the free market
to do you know what free people on the
free market do because I think that's
good in the long run
and what I think is good for the system
right now
is that people like me leave YouTube
unless we can get more visibility
right all I'm asking you is a little
more visibility on the situation but I
don't think they can I don't think it's
in their interest to give it to me
and I don't think it's going to happen
so I'm just going to exercise my free
market
citizen responsibility to go where I
know this won't be a problem
so I Rumble I won't have any of this
I'll bet I'll bet there will be zero
demonetization demonetization unrumble
would you agree I'll bet zero times I'll
be demonetized and you know what's
interesting about that
Rumble also uses ads to make money
so if Rumble decides that they don't
need to demonetize me and they can still
sell ads well then you might have a
little question
about why YouTube thinks the opposite
now it could be that YouTube is right
that they make more money
by being better to their advertisers and
and maybe but maybe the people who
advertise and Rumble know exactly what
they're getting and might even get a
better deal maybe it's more they might
get more attention per dollar
on rumbles so they know exactly what
they're getting so I'm going to let the
free market work this out
because as an individual I can't figure
out what's going on with YouTube and I
don't think there are any buttons for me
to push to get my answers right so
unless Elon Musk buys YouTube which is
not going to happen
how would I ever know so I just have to
do what the free market tells me to do
so that's that's what's behind it right
this is this is not some big
I'm not going on a hunger strike
I'm just doing the normal thing a
citizen would do
in a realm of uncertainty
I just let the free market work it out
if YouTube wants to lose people like me
on an ongoing basis
maybe it makes no difference to them and
then everybody's happy
but if it does make a difference to them
then the system is working it's doing
what doing what it's supposed to do
all right Elon Musk uh tweeted about
this uh Omnibus Bill you know what the
government does how they launder their
vote
so if you don't know exactly
what this big Omnibus stuff is about
here's the quick explanation
if Congress said hey here's a very
specific spending bill
what do you think everybody some people
will be for it so I'm going to be
against it
and then their voters would say wait a
minute even though I like you as my
representative I wish you hadn't voted
the way you did on that one thing so now
this now this politician loses some
people
because of that vote but probably didn't
gain anybody right it's just all
downside
so every time a politician votes on a
specific bill
that everybody knows what that is oh I
know exactly what that bill is all about
that's bad for the politician
is that the worst situation you've ever
seen like actually voting in a clear way
for a very specific thing no matter what
it is is bad for the politician because
people aren't going to like them better
but they're going to have a reason to
dislike them
right
so the way that Congress solves this
is that they all collude and that's what
it is they collude against the Citizens
um
and the way they do it is they agreed to
throw all of their crap that they don't
want to be responsible for into one
gigantic
Frankenstein bill
that if you pile up the pages it's
literally I don't know two feet tall or
something it's like a big pile so this
is what this does it guarantees that
nobody in Congress can read it it's too
big it guarantees that no citizen can
read it it guarantees that no Paul that
no reporter can read it
so it removes all the information
about the connection between the
politicians and what they support and
they do that so that you can't have a
reason to be mad at them
and the downside
is that we are an unmanaged country
let me be as clear about this as
possible
I'm not saying that Congress is making
bad decisions
do you understand the difference
I'm not saying that Congress is making
good decisions
and I'm not saying they're making bad
decisions
what I'm saying is
they've abandoned their jobs
they just abandoned their jobs they were
hired to make decisions and they found a
way to not do it
they found a way just to throw every
every every everything in the same bag
and hide hide who is responsible
so the most the most basic function of
government
is to make decisions on your behalf and
then we the people get to see what they
did and then we get to say okay I'd like
a little more of that politician or like
a little less of them the politicians
have found a way to remove
public scrutiny from their jobs
that's not doing a good job or a bad job
do you get that
you cannot say the Congress is doing a
bad job because they're not doing the
job
that's not the job
who exactly hired them to do that who
hired them to hide their vote behind it
Omnibus exactly zero people they're not
working for their state they're not
working for their constituents they're
not even working for the
their lobbyists
I mean think about it it's not even for
the lobbyists it's not for anybody it's
literally just to hide their
responsibility
who else could do that you might imagine
a private business where the employees
never had to be responsible to the boss
because they could just hide their bad
behavior in something complicated
do you know what that's called
most big businesses because in most
cases the CEO doesn't know what's going
on
look at Russia
do you think Russia got in any trouble
because Putin did not have visibility
about the actual quality of his own
military
do you think that caused any problems
for Russia yeah it destroyed their whole
 country
their whole country is going down the
because they had no visibility the the
boss Putin had no visibility of his most
important asset his military no
visibility
that that's what your Congress did to
you same thing so this the thing that's
crushing Russia is that the boss
couldn't tell what was going on
would you agree that was the problem the
boss didn't know what was going on
um you know FTX says that too but I
don't think that's true in that case
all right
so I think the news and the pundits are
getting this whole Congress omnibusting
completely wrong
because they're treating it like they're
doing a bad job
that's the wrong story
Congress decided not to do any job
they're not doing a bad job they're not
doing any job nobody's job if they're
not deciding what to spend money on and
what not to
that's not anything
am I right
am I off base here this is not a case of
good or bad they're simply not doing it
and they found a way to make it look
like oh we did something well obviously
not doing anything because just saying
yes to everything that anybody asked for
is the opposite of managing
and how often have I said that which is
not measured
is not managed
have I said that too many times already
that which is not measured
is not managed by definition because
management means I'll make some changes
and I'm measuring how things used to be
and I'll see if my change
I can measure to show that it's made
things best Better or Worse that's
managing
if you're not measuring you're not
managing so we have a government
we hired to manage who tells us directly
oh instead of doing what you hired me to
do managing things and then see how they
went I'm going to hide all the
information from you my bosses you know
the public and then I'll just take a
holiday and not have to do my work
why do we pay them
why do we pay them
here's what I suggest I think the
citizens should push for whatever it
takes Constitutional Amendment or
whatever
to require that anytime that Congress
passes an omni bus bill that we don't
pay them
we still maybe we have to run the
country so they got to pay but we just
don't pay them because that would be a
confession that they can't do their job
and I don't know why you'd pay somebody
who confesses they're not going to do
their job
it'd be one thing if you weren't sure
they were doing their job
but if they tell you directly we're
going to use an Omnibus instead of work
why would you pay them
so
I mean even though I assume there's no
way to succeed don't you think the
government or that the Citizens need to
push back in a specific way
in a specific way would be
let's tie your performance to your
actions
and unless we should not we should not
tie their pay to whether we like what
they do or not that's different I'm not
saying that you give them a cut and pay
if they pass the law you don't like
nothing like that that's that's just
what voting is for right vote them in
vote them out so that's how you rate
them on their individual decisions
but I'm saying that we should not pay
anybody who says to you directly
thanks for hiring me I'm not going to do
the thing you hired before
I'm just going to throw it in an Omnibus
and go on vacation go home and see the
kids
seriously why are we paying them and
this is a question I think should be
asked you know I saw somebody ask Chuck
Schumer why do you think this is good to
do it this way when nobody has time to
read the bill and it's obviously full of
pork and stuff and as Schumer says oh
you know the people who put it together
know what's in it
so it's not it's not important that the
people who vote for it
uh no it's in the people who put it
together worked very hard and very long
and so the committee that put it all
together knows exactly what's in there
so don't worry
here's the question that should have
been asked why should we pay you Chuck
Schumer
like actually that question you know the
the public is higher hired you to do a
job
I think you would agree that the Omnibus
allows you to avoid doing the job of
deciding what to pay what to fund and
what not so honest question why should
the public pay you
now I also wonder could a president do
an executive order to withhold their pay
until they do their job
legally I'm sure no right legally now
but is there any way that they could
game the system by having control over
who cuts the checks
does the president let me ask this does
who who controls the actual check the
the issuing of the digital or physical
check to Congress who controls that
Congress themselves
the GSA somebody says and the GSA would
be controlled by
the OMB which would be controlled by
I thought that was executive branch
all right well look into it but my guess
is that the executive branch has
something to do with payroll
am I wrong about that that would be the
obvious way to do it I wouldn't put
Congress in charge of the payrolls
would you
that doesn't make sense you're saying
the house is in charge of payroll
I mean it could be
I don't know I feel like the executive
branch has at least some part of
government they could lean on to stop
checks from being issued
just a really just to raise it as an
issue now I think Congress probably
needs to get paid right but I feel as a
to raise the issue it would be useful
but I don't think any Republican wants
to do it either
for the same reason
all right uh what do you think of Elon
Musk weighing in on this with he he ran
a Twitter poll and uh
what percentage of people is very
unscientific of course you all know a
Twitter poll is not scientific
but what percentage of the people
thought the Omnibus was a maybe a good
deal
well very good guess yeah roughly a
quarter roughly a quarter 28 percent
but right around the quarter
and do you think that it was appropriate
for musk to run a Twitter poll
which you know is unscientific and then
use it to
you know promote his opinions about
government stuff
yeah the the reason that I think it's
appropriate
number one he owns Twitter so using his
own asset of course and number two
everybody understands the Twitter poll
is not a real poll right
every we all know that right is there
anybody who would be confused by that
I suppose maybe
um
yeah oh I don't mind as long as to me
that looks fully transparent he's
telling you his opinion you showing you
the poll
the poll is not scientific but don't you
think any scientific poll would have the
same result
let me ask you if Rasmussen or Gallup or
somebody else did the same poll
do you think we would find out oh people
love and Omni Omnibus Bill
so this very special case
the fact that the Twitter poll is
unscientific
doesn't really change anything it's a
very special case because nobody
believes that any other poll would give
them a different result am I right does
anybody think a different poll done more
scientifically or scientifically at all
does anybody believe it would have been
a different outcome
we all know it would have been the same
right roughly 75 percent would say an
Omnibus Bill is a bad idea for the
public
all right um
okay we talk about excess deaths after
the pandemic
would you agree that this is not about
the pandemic but it's about how to how
to look at data
so the thing that I like to
do more than anything with my live
stream
is talk about how we consumers of news
can do a better job of understanding the
news and what's true and what's not so
the context that I'm going to give you
next is always about how to understand
the news
yeah if it sounds like I'm Pro or
anti-sung pandemic thing that's not the
topic today all right and I've got a few
new things to throw into this that you
haven't heard before surprisingly
so I think everybody agrees that there
are excess deaths
can you do give me a fact check
everybody agrees their rxs deaths
since the summer of 2021 about the same
time that vaccinations were rolled out
so-called vaccinations and does
everybody agree that that the data seems
to show
that around the time of the vaccinations
the excess death started to Skyrocket
everybody I think that's true right
now
um
have the number of cancers
deaths deaths by cancer have they
increased because the pandemic caused
people to delay treatment
yes or no
the surprising answer is it made no
difference
now according to some government
officials I saw today or government
numbers there was definitely an increase
in heart attacks so heart related
problems so heart related problems
definitely went up and and the beginning
was definitely about the time of the uh
the shots coming through not because of
not because of necessarily that's what
we're going to talk about but about the
same time
now
did you know that did your news source
tell you
that the government's official numbers
do confirm their excess deaths but
they're not in the cancer category the
cancer deaths are right on Baseline
so it turns out that whole narrative
about delaying cancer treatment
was almost not almost was certainly true
for individuals
meaning that definitely there are
anecdotes of people who delayed
treatment and it probably made a
difference but overall
it's about the same
now so that would that would indicate
that whatever's happening was more heart
related
all right yeah and I know some of you
could have to check that fact
so go check that fact and see if the
cancer deaths do look kind of flat if
that's true
then that can at least help our mystery
right so now our mystery could be more
focused on heart related things which
definitely went up definitely will not
and I believe the country is now largely
agreed the young people were worse off
young males were worse off with a shot
is that now
believed by everybody
as far as I know every every all data
shows the same thing
right
I need a fact check on that
I think that's a yes man so there's
still a lot of mystery right so here's
what I'm going to toss into the mystery
here are other reasons
that death rate by heart attack would
spike at the same time as
the vaccinations were rolled out
all right reason number one
the people who make the vaccinations
admitted
because we know this is always true
there should be side effects from
vaccinations
would everybody agree that even the
people who made the vaccination said yes
there is some amount of adverse effects
so some portion of the uptick
you could say for sure was related to
adverse effects so far everybody on the
same page
some percentage
everybody would agree including the
people who made them
that there'd be some extra negative
effects right we don't know yet
whether the the benefits outweigh the
the
opposite but you should see some more
heart attacks that would be the normal
thing you should expect to see but we
don't know how much right there's still
how much question
all right here are some other things you
would expect
do you think that the pandemic lowered
people's oxytocin
so oxytocin is the The Beneficial health
related
um
what do you call it hormone that uh that
you get or chemical release that you get
when you're having a social interaction
that's a positive one
right so I think you would agree that
our oxytocin levels went down during
social uh distancing would you all agree
that your normal oxytocin levels should
go way down okay
now
I Googled
oxytocin and heart disease
what do you think I found
exactly what you think right without
knowing I thought you know I'll bet you
if I Google oxytocin and heart disease
if you don't have enough oxytocin I'll
bet you get heart disease
guess what
you get heart disease if you don't have
enough oxytocin
so there's a direct
very well understood correlation put
people in isolation
oxytocin goes down
heart disease goes up
any any argument with that
would anybody argue with that direct
line of influence anybody
no of course not so that's definitely
part of it
no no don't know if it's a small part or
a big part
now how about cortisol
cortisol is your stress chemistry if you
have more cortisol is that going to be
good or bad for your cardio
situation bad bad right do you think
people had more oxytocin because they
had to stay home locked in a place and
couldn't have you know normal Recreation
of course of course
so we have we have and those are not the
only chemicals right that keep you
healthy there there is a range of
chemicals from oxytocin to cortisol Etc
that are very directly
Changed by changing our living situation
and locking us down
all of those things should have reduced
should have resulted collectively in a
massive amount of extra
deaths
now and that would be unrelated directly
to the vaccination but very related to
the bad decision to lock down the way we
did
so that would be a direct connection
between the management of our government
and the outcomes the number of heart
attacks it was pretty Direct
now you say I'm guessing but I'm not
guessing about the connection
it's a well-established connection you
do this to people their chemistry
changes this way change that chemistry
that way they have more heart attacks
it's very direct
now about this
do you think there were more over uh
more suicides
when social distancing was lifted or
when it was in place
what would you expect just
commonsensically would there be more
suicides when you're in a house full of
people or more suicides when you can get
some privacy
so yeah I just I just changed your
change your answer by the way I asked it
now there's no way you're going to kill
yourself in a house full of people
let me reverse that of course some
people will
that would be the rarest kind of suicide
the rare suicide is that there's
somebody that wants to save you
literally on the other side of the door
right you wouldn't do it then
especially if you were concerned about
who finds you
is my Common Sense opinion based based
on no data there's no data but it's my
Common Sense opinion that nobody kills
himself in a crowded house
when I say nobody I mean mostly mostly
right would you agree does that make
sense that if you were of that frame of
mind you would go somewhere where you
could be alone
and that was much harder during the
pandemic
and also I think that some people even
if they hated being around people at
least they weren't lonely
like there must have been a lot of
lonely people
who were forced to be with other people
for the first time
Maybe
so that kind of disruption you could
have you could imagine would create a
you know a little spurt at the end what
about uh the people dying of just
regular covet
did you know that more people died of
covet this year than uh I think Moore
died in this year than last year did you
know that
in the United States more people died of
covet this year than last year you know
after massive vaccinations
give me a fact check but I think that's
true right more people died this year
than last year of covet would I say of
covid let's not get into the
conversation we know there's a question
about how they're you know how that data
is collected
but those are the official data
now
why would kova desk go up at the same
time
as vaccinations are being rolled out
well it could be some people say well
obviously that's telling us the
vaccinations are killing people could be
that's entirely possible I'm not ruling
that out at all here's the other reason
because at the same time they rolled out
the vaccinations
they they lifted the restrictions
and everybody went out and acted safe
but in terms turns out they were not
safe because the vaccination did not
make them safe so they got covered and
died
so it turns out that lifting the
mandates
has a very predictable impact
we know more people are going to die and
we still want to do it because you know
Freedom right so you should have seen a
massive increase in covides at the same
time as the vaccination
under all circumstances you would have
seen the massive increase if the
vaccination was killing people and I
don't see that evidence in terms of
killing more people than covid and you
would see it if it was just covered
so under all scenarios there would be a
spike with or without the vaccinations
does that make sense
logically as soon as we lifted the
restrictions there would be more deaths
no matter what no matter what but at
least you could choose that was that was
what they offered us wasn't true but
they but the government would say well
you could choose to be safe by getting
vaccinated
you can argue that
so then it became more of a personal
choice so even the government was was
allowing that they would allow more
people to die
but everybody died would at least have a
choice of having getting the vaccination
and changing their odds according to the
government
according to the government
all right what else are there any other
possible reasons number one did you know
that the fentanyl was re replacing
heroin at exactly the same time
how many of you knew that the mix of
fentanyl to heroin changed radically at
about the same time that the
vaccinations came out did you know that
it's right about the same time
and that should have created a massive
spike in overdose deaths did we see a
massive spike in overdose deaths that
started about the same time as the
vaccinations
did that happen
do you know
did we see a massive Spike in overdoses
because of fentanyl at the same time at
exactly the same time as the
vaccinations were being rolled down yes
yes it was exactly the same time I say
exactly but you know what I mean it was
at that period
so again
the the direct you know increase in
deaths at exactly the time is the
vaccination
wouldn't be completely explained by
Fentanyl would you agree
fentanyl is clearly not the whole
explanation here but remember we've now
got like five or six very clear things
that would have happened at the same
time
probably five or six the vaccination is
one and I do not rule out at all that it
could have caused all of the excess
deaths Maybe
maybe because I don't have data one way
or the other
but would you agree that all of the
other things I'm mentioning happened
about the same time and logically should
have caused the increase of deaths that
we see exactly the way we see them
and let's see what else here's another
one let's see if anybody thought of this
one
you know that traffic accidents were up
right
I'll need a fact check on that too but
at one point I heard that after the
lockdown traffic accidents went up do
you know why
obviously
obviously
why there's an obvious reason
because people drove less for two years
I I had trouble driving in traffic after
the lockdowns were over did you
does anybody have trouble driving in
heavy traffic
it was hard wasn't it
yeah it was I was actually out of
practice
and it was a little a little nervous
making it first took me a while to work
my way back into being what I considered
a good enough driver
because I drove planning during the
lockdown I did a lot of driving
but it was all on empty streets
you know like easy driving
right so
now since we also know that overdose
deaths were up
whether it's fentanyl or anything else
overdose deaths were way up
what will that do to driving accidents
yeah it's probably related to how much
how much drugs people haven't and there
was probably a rebound effect where
people have been locked down for two
years and the people were locked down
for two years didn't know how to handle
partying anymore
like they forgot how to get a designated
driver you know and I say that literally
like you could actually get out of the
habit of knowing how to protect yourself
that's the thing
because everything's habit-based right
even knowing how to keep yourself alive
the most basics of Life are habit-based
and people got out of the habit of
staying alive knowing that I better
leave my keys you know with my friend
so some of that now how much of that was
causing excess deaths maybe none
maybe none but if you ignore it I think
you're ignoring a big potential variable
um how about obesity
how about obesity
obesity was at its highest about the
same time
as the vaccinations why was obesity at
its highest
at the same time as the vaccinations
because that was the same moment we
opened up the gyms right
at the same time the vaccinations were
coming out that's why they opened the
gym
because it seemed safer
so
you should have seen all these fat
people
go out and try to exercise for the first
time in two years and have heart attacks
and fall over because they didn't know
that they couldn't do what they used to
do
right now again it's probably not a
gigantic number of people but look at
all the things that collectively should
have killed more people
Lindsay says
let me take care of this stupid
first and by the way that's probably
what gets me demonetized all right
Lindsey Jackson you stupid and all
capitals Scott why did you support
lockdowns never happened not
once not indirectly not directly not
once you right well you
could come over here and you stop rumors
like that you decrease the effectiveness
of what I'm doing by lowering my
credibility you are a traitorous
 because what I do is
specifically designed to help people
live better you are detracting from that
check yourself unless you're a
Russian troll in which case good job if
you're a real person you are a
piece of Lindsay Jackson I doubt
that's a real person but you are a real
piece of just just check your check
what you're doing right now
good creating rumors that decrease the
effectiveness of something that's only
positive
only positive to understand how better
to understand our news right am I
hurting you am I hurting you in
some way Lindsay get the
 out of here
I don't think she's real by the way I
think that's just Trolls
but I want to make that very clear now
does anybody know why I go off so hard
how many of you know why I do that
because I don't think it's obvious to a
lot of people
because I'm an energy monster
I just took her negative energy and I
used it to clarify a rumor that a lot of
people have because there are other
people who have that point of view so by
going off on that stupid in a way
that you can't possibly ignore
I mean if a public figure calls a
specific individual a stupid ignorant
useless
you can't look away right
do you think anybody turned off this
feed while I was going off on her
of course not you got to see how that
ends right so what I do is I take her
negative energy
I package it
I I use it to make a case that's good
for me and also good for you because you
would like to know what's true and let's
not true
and that I use that energy for my
purposes and then we move on right so
that's what you're seeing in case you're
wondering what's behind it I'm like am I
am I losing control
how many think I lost control
does anybody think that
do you think that was an example of me
getting angry and losing control no it
wasn't
I don't know if I've ever lost control
like in my life I'm not sure I've ever
been so angry
that I lost control I don't know that's
ever happened
if it ever happens
you're really going to know it
you won't be confused if I ever lose
control because I'm angry you're gonna
know it you won't if you're wondering if
I lost control then I didn't
if there's any doubt about it it
definitely didn't happen
you won't have any doubt if it happens
all right um so obesity we also didn't
talk about long covet now I don't even
know if long covet is real right
thank you Gina
um I don't know if long covet is real
but if it is don't you think it would
kill some people
who were maybe marginal to begin with it
might be real I don't know so throw that
in the mix too
um
all right and then do you think people
would do more or less drugs and drinking
after social distancing is lifted
generally speaking
do you think that when people are alone
they do the same amount of drugs as when
they're with people who are doing drugs
also
I I feel like people would do more drugs
with people
does anybody disagree no everybody's
different right so it could go either
way but on average
all right so here's how I think people
die
if you got some drugs from a friend
you might ask some questions about you
know the Providence of them Providence
where they came from
um
and so you might do a little bit of a
good job protecting your your risks or
your life so you might ask some good
questions if you're alone and you're
just going to take that drug and sit in
your room now let's say you go to a
party
you're really buzzed at the party
somebody hands you a beer
well you didn't want to mix
but that does look delicious and you're
thirsty so you take the beer
now you're a little bit drunk maybe have
a second one a little bit drunk and
somebody says hey
how about this pill
it says addicts I promise you it's his
addicts and now you're totally drunk and
you're not making good decisions
and you say all right if Bob says it's
good I'll take it well
and it's Fentanyl
and you die
because you already had too much of
other stuff in you
so there's there's a there's a pure
effect when you're with people to take a
little extra
or a little different like well you're
already buzzed from this but would it
kill you would it kill you to take this
too
see my drug taking experience tells me
this if you're doing drugs by yourself
at home during social distancing it
could be pretty bad and you might even
creep up how much you're doing because
maybe you get used to it right so you
can see people doing way too much drugs
at home alone
but when you add other people those
other people add not just drugs
But A diversity of drugs
it's the diversity of what your friends
have in their pockets that will kill you
it's not you deciding how much you're
going to make all by yourself it's your
friend saying you know
it wouldn't kill you to take one more of
these
except that it actually kills you
so that's that's just a
um a whole bunch of assumptions
so at the same time the vaccinations
were rolled out you should see more ODS
you should be see more drug-related
deaths of every kind
from
crime to accidents to traffic accidents
I usually more drugs when people are
socially distancing you should see more
heart disease because of the social
distancing that should have had a
cumulative effect you should see more
obesity related dying more suicide
related dying people aren't practiced to
driving we don't know if long covet is
killing anybody or not
and then of course there's more more
people getting out and so they got more
infected Etc
so
given all of that
I'll give you the final Twitter poll
where I asked do you believe based on
your news sources that more people died
from covid
or the coveted shots you know speaking
in the more recent times did more people
die from covid or the coveted shots at
least from the time that the coven shots
were widely available
or is there no way to know
here were the results the people who
said that more people died from covid
than from the shots about one quarter
about one quarter
thank you
I appreciate that William
um
now how many people said that the shots
themselves killed more people than the
kova did
about one quarter actually 25 exactly 25
and how many said there's no way to know
49 now you remember my 25 rule of course
you do
that 25 will get every question wrong
but this one's weird isn't it because
there are two 25s and they're opposites
they can't both be true right it can't
be true that more people died of
vaccinations than covid while also true
that more people died of covert than
vaccinations so they can't both be true
so would this be an exception
to my rock solid rule that 25 of the
public gets everything wrong
it's not
because both of the 25 are wrong
they're both wrong
what's true is you don't know
the the 50 or the half of the people who
said there's no way to know that was
unambiguously the right answer
unambiguously this is one of those few
where you you don't have to wonder about
the right answer
no matter what you think is happening
it's unambiguously true that you can't
know for sure
unambiguously you could be really really
like 90 95 sure that the vaccinations
are worse than the covet or vice versa
and and both types of people exist
but if you're sure about it that you're
probably not as good at analyzing as the
people who are not sure about it
now some of the not Shores are just
uninformed so they're they're telling
you they're uninformed which is fair
do two rooms make a right I don't think
that's what's happening
you you think someone knows I don't
think so
I don't think there's anybody who knows
now let me ask you this
how many extra heart attacks do you
think
uh like sudden deaths from heart related
things how much extra do you think the
official numbers say is happening
because it's very noticeable
like the the Baseline is definitely more
than the Baseline but how much more do
you think
how much more like the top of your head
how many more heart attacks are a
doctors see
what do you think
would you what do you think is 50 more
50 percent
10 percent
so I don't know the answer to that
because I saw a graph
so the the graph was visual I didn't see
the base numbers but the official number
that I saw this morning
is that absolutely heart attacks are up
so we can all agree on that right so I
believe even the official numbers say
heart attacks are up or heart related
you know cardiac stuff so everybody's on
the same page significant increase in
heart attacks but how significant
five percent
25 percent
uh visually it looked like about five
percent
Maybe 10.
let me ask you this
have you not seen reports from doctors
saying my god there are so many more
heart attacks
there's definitely a problem here you've
all seen those right individual numbers
of them doctors uh various metal people
saying oh my God it's so different like
you can't miss it
right we've all seen it we know those
exist
now let me ask you this
is there a discrepancy here
do you think that all those
professionals would have noticed a 10
change
in anything
in anything would they have noticed a 10
change from the Baseline
now
now
it it can't be true that those are
credible people telling you that that
they have noticed personally way too
many heart attack related deaths
it can't be
because if it's like five or ten percent
difference nobody would notice that
and if they did notice it they would
tell you it's five or ten percent
different
they wouldn't be screaming my god do you
know that people are you know falling on
the sidewalks and everybody can see it
because the official numbers don't have
anything like that it's very clear
something's happening
no doubt about it well I suppose I could
doubt all data I do that sometimes but
it does seem that all of the data is in
the same direction
something's killing people extra
but it doesn't look like the medical
professionals are matching the official
government data
which could be that the medical
professionals are right and the data is
wrong I won't rule that out
10 is definitely actionable but would
not match
the hysterical
um it's obvious there's more of it
those just don't match but yes 10 would
be a big deal and you have to worry
about that
all right speaking of uh
Sean Hannity I guess that to testify on
this Dominion lawsuit against Fox News
and Sean Hannity said about Trump's
claims of election fraud quote I did not
believe it for one second
now you might say to yourself well what
was I watching for the last if you
watched the Hannity Show you're probably
saying what was I watching for the last
two years or whatever since the election
one year
didn't it seem like he was questioning
the election
did it seem like it to you
so the news is mocking Hannity
for saying that he
acted like he believed the claims
but now when he's in you know under oath
he says he doesn't did he notice
anything missing in the stories because
there were a bunch of reports on it was
anything missing
anything missing in the story
yeah like the evidence that the story is
true
now it might be true but wouldn't you
expect that that kind of story would be
accompanied by an actual quote by
Hannity where Hannity was saying I
believe what the president is saying
and then you can say oh shoot he said
the opposite in court
where's that
where where is the obvious clip that of
course they're digging around all of his
enemies and they would produce it this
says directly the opposite of what he
claimed under oath huh I haven't seen it
have you
you haven't seen it now I'm not
saying it doesn't exist
but there's been enough time
right that takes one hour before
somebody's you know created a
compilation clip of all the reasons
you're lying if he's lying
if he said it under Court the opposite
of what he said on TV show it to me
show it to me
why haven't I seen it
now I think what people are doing is
they're conflating that he gave air he
gave oxygen to the complaints but having
somebody on who's a real person who's in
a real position of Authority or even a
pundit who's a well-established person
having them say what they believe is
true is not exactly Hannity's fault is
it
his show is having people on with
opinions and telling you their opinion
there are obviously some of them are
wrong because it's opinions obviously
some of the opinion people are wrong is
is Hannity responsible for the opinions
of everybody has in the show
like in a general way maybe but if he
didn't say directly I believe these
machines were rigged then all he did was
tell the truth twice
that's all I say I see him telling the
truth twice
once when he didn't you know take on the
unsupported claim and once when he said
I never took on that unsupported claim
now here's another thing that's getting
conflated
the fox lawsuit is specifically about
the voting machines
right you know that right it's not about
all their claims it's about just the
voting machines
I think it's very possible that Hannity
has never himself said the voting
machines are rich
he may have said there's lots of sketchy
things here he may have said we don't
know he may have said we're going to
talk to somebody who says they are
he may have said he better said a lot of
things but if he never said
those things are rigged
he's in the clear
because what does he tell you on the
regular
I'm an opinion show
if you tell people you're an opinion
show you don't offer them fake claims
you're you're in the clear
I don't know I thought
I don't see anything there so we'll see
what happens
um
all right
here's the FBI's response to all the
Twitter files
and they're really totally gaslighting
me
when I read the FBI's response
is very disorienting because I I tend to
be swimming in the claims
so when you see the claims
they're so different than what the FBI
says is a reality it's very disorienting
and what the FBI says is
just normal business to tell to tell
companies there might be somebody
violating their terms of service we
never ask them to do anything we just
give them information and they act up
they act according to their terms of
service
now
is that what you saw
the Twitter files suggest that it was a
very ordinary routine contact
uh that the payment for is also a
routine that's routine because they're
they're causing a burden on the company
so they're apparently there's some
legislation that allows the company to
get reimbursed and so the FBI routinely
reimburses because that's the law
the law says they can reimburse them to
those situations they like following the
law so they do
so that's the FBI's version is this is
all normal we do it with other platforms
we reimburse because we put a burden on
them we don't force them to do anything
we just we just call out things that
violated terms of service
why is that their job
why isn't the FBI's job to monitor
Twitter's terms of service
like how does others make sense
but but when they say it in sort of an
ordinary way your brain just goes oh
it's just ordinary business
and it's very persuasive until you think
about it it's like
but why well why would that be ordinary
business
and
then
you have the laptop situation which was
a special case within the the larger you
know Association the FBI had with
Twitter in that special case
the FBI was allegedly warning them that
there might be some what they said was
fake information from the Russians
and were they obviously priming Twitter
to not believe the laptop story
well
it's not directly in evidence
but it wouldn't be
right because the FBI wouldn't say it
directly
so does it look for all the world like
that's exactly what they were doing yes
but here's the interesting part
did the did the FBI agents who were
directly working with Twitter did they
know what the truth was
and if they did how would they know like
how would those specific FBI agents know
that some people in the FBI who knew the
truth were lying to everybody because
it's not like the FBI was telling its
own people hey everybody we're going to
lie about this
the the people of the FBI would have
believed the same lie
if there was a lie from the FBI
management that the rest of us would
have believed right why would the rank
and file not believe their own
management if their own management says
there's nothing to see here
the FBI is going to say well I trust
them you know I know these guys they
looked in there's nothing to say
so there's no direct evidence that the
FBI agents who are directly dealing with
Twitter were even aware that they were
doing anything wrong
they may have been completely unaware of
it
now that still doesn't make it good or
right you know it's too the whole thing
is too dirty to allow to go on
but the the other thing we learned is
that they do it at other platforms
don't you think those other platforms
have some explaining to do and then I'm
gonna here's the here's a real uh
question I asked this morning on Twitter
so if this is normal business
then the FBI has also contacted truth
social
and is working on a regular basis with
truth social
to let true social know and this is very
handy for True social if anything on
their platform
has violated the true social terms of
service
so that's happened right
wouldn't you like to know
wouldn't you like to know yeah does does
getter does Rumble is FBI in inserted
with all the let's say uh more free
speech platforms you would say maybe
right right leaning
but free speech as well do you think the
FBI has just as much or they're trying
to have they been have they been
rebuffed did they try it with Rumble and
Rumble said no get out of here
why don't we know that
just just think about the fact
of how obvious that question was are
they doing it with truth are they doing
it with Rumble
the most obvious question in the world
who who asked besides me
who in the media asked that question
it gets better
yeah are they doing it for tick tock now
for tick tock we assume that they
they're not
because it's a chinese-owned company
I mean that's a good enough reason to
say tick tock would be different but do
you know what we found out about uh
um Twitter recently as well
we found out that our intelligence
people
uh were with with the understanding and
agreement of Twitter we're running fake
accounts on Twitter to influence foreign
countries
so Twitter and the FBI were working
together
fully knowing what each was doing
to build fake accounts on Twitter that
would look real and would influence uh
people in the Middle East in particular
now how many of you think that that
should not happen
do you think that our intelligence
agents should work with our our
platforms to influence other countries
yes or no
yeah I think you could argue either way
on this one
um
so so now this is confirmed is my
understanding this is a confirmed
nobody's questioning the facts of this
that our intelligence did run Ops
on Twitter
to persuade you know and the persuasion
would be illegitimate
because it's not real people it would
too illegitimately persuade other other
countries and other publics in those
countries so we know that's happened
so um
if the United States with all of our
awesomeness
and I think you'd agree
that our government is way more ethical
and nice than the Chinese government
I mean our government there are Straight
Shooters
right
so if they're using the platform in
their country to influence other
countries
makes you wonder why nobody in China
thought of that huh
isn't that weird
it was so obvious to our intelligence
people that influencing a social media
platform was how you influence other
countries it was so obvious to us and
yet those double Chinese
like a like a billion Chinese and nobody
thought of it and nobody thought of it
are you kidding me are you
 kidding me of course they
thought of it of course China is doing
the same thing on Tick Tock a
course
you think we're the only ones who
thought of it the fact that we are
definitely doing it to China
using Twitter
in other words we're influencing in a
way that's good for the United States
and maybe not so good for China
you think they didn't think of it like
are we so stupid that we're
supposed to say here and go oh well yeah
of course our intelligence people
thought of it because the most
influential thing in the world is our
social media
and we thought of it but but there's a
billion people in China who are all so
 dumb that they never thought of
it and so citizens of the United States
you should be perfectly happy having
Tick Tock into your country because
there's the logical explanation
I tell you again
there is literally nobody in the United
States government
on the side of keeping Tick Tock
available in the United States
none
there's not one
and we know that social media is used by
the country that owns it to influence
other countries illegitimately because
we do it of course we do it is there
anybody here who thought we didn't do it
nobody
but why do we act like maybe it's not
happening on Tick Tock oh maybe it's not
happening there but everybody's doing it
everywhere else but not tick tock
do we even have a government
so we have a government that completely
abandons its job on the Omni bus bill we
all agree with that the Omnibus is how
they abandon doing their job because
they didn't have to make any decisions
we look at the border
and what are they doing on the border
they're trying to pretend nothing's
happening literally they're not doing it
well they're not doing it poorly they're
actually not doing it
what are they doing on Banning uh tick
tock
well there's no debate because there
doesn't need to be one because
everybody's on the same side what do you
say about a government where everybody
has the same opinion and yet they don't
act on such an important
thing
that would be not doing your job poorly
that would not be doing your job well
that would be not doing your job
am I right
this is different from not doing your
job well
we're not talking about that
that's no job done at all
Fentanyl
we know where it comes from we know how
many people is killing
we know where I'm sure we know where the
fentanyl is being produced and yet the
people who are producing the fence and
they'll sit there undisturbed
do you don't think we could solve that
problem
or at least put a dent in it
but we're not doing it poorly
and we're not doing it well
we're not doing it
we're not trying
I don't see all I see is that the people
who already existed the border patrol
people being overwhelmed
that doesn't look like trying
right so
um
yeah
so have you ever seen the situation
quite like this where where Congress
actually just stopped doing the job of
Congress
they just stopped and and if you don't
pay attention to each of these
individual issues and you don't realize
that they stop making decisions
they just stopped
did your Tucker the other day on a show
he said unambiguously and I believe he
would know this right so he didn't give
his sources or name any details but this
would be one thing
that you would know that a Tucker
Carlson would know for sure
members of Congress are being
blackmailed
and he laughed and said I'm not guessing
I know that for sure
do you think he knows that for sure
I do
I do and I'll bet that anybody in this
position knows it for sure they may not
say it but I'll bet they all know it for
sure they might even know the specific
examples probably they're probably no
specific examples
think about that
so
something needs to happen and I don't
know how it can because usually we use
the government to fix the government and
it looks like the government just
stopped trying
normally in that situation you'd expect
the public to rise up and maybe demand
something except the media keeps the
public from rising because it just keeps
us divided and fighting about
we're fighting about wokeness and
pronouns and
so we don't have any mechanism
for making Congress work
there's no mechanism for that
here here's how you could break
it
I'll say this until somebody does it you
need a credible well-run debate show
where the public can learn what's true
via the debate
without having to depend on the fake
news
or on social media or the
government which are three entities we
know will lie to us
now a debate will also be maybe two
Liars but if you do it right you'll very
quickly find out what's true and what's
not because the ideal debate format
would be a strong host who will
interrupt
you need an interrupting host because
otherwise somebody will just keep going
on and they're not addressing the fact
you need an interrupting host you need
unlimited time
so people aren't running out the clock
unlimited time and you need the people
who are debating to have sitting right
next to them with a laptop open a fact
checker
and here's how it goes the one one
debater will say and everybody knows X
is true and then I as the host would go
oh hold on I don't believe it's true
that everybody would agree with that
fact fact Checkers give us a source then
the fact Checkers go blah blah blah blah
and maybe you edited it so that that the
time you know you don't have to wait for
the fact Checkers so if you're watching
it you're watching a recorded version so
quickly they check and the fact Checkers
say oh here's a source that says it's
true
here's a sources this is not then then
The Debaters have to debate about
whether the quality of those sources is
good
much better than anything we're seeing
now now they might get hung up on like
one little part of the debate
and and just go way down that well
because I can't even decide on that one
thing fine I have two debates so maybe
that day is only about that one fact
but you need to have an open-ended as
long as it takes model you need an
interrupting host
to interrupt a lot oh hold on
does that make sense to you
would you agree with that fact before he
goes on with this point right if you
don't have an interrupting host you just
let people like talk for two minutes
each or whatever that's for a different
purpose
that'd be like a good college debate or
something but you know because you're
trying to make it fair but if you're
actually trying to find out what's true
versus what's not true you need an
interrupting aggressive host to cut them
off the moment they've they've Departed
the point which they all try to do
I see no way of educating the public so
that the public could fix their
government because the government won't
face it themselves fake news won't tell
you what's true it'll just keep us
divided and social media just makes
everything worse
would you agree
there's no obvious
system in place that would move the
needle in any way
but it could be
it would have to be also provocative
because
nobody would watch the debate show if it
were boring but if you had the right
host
like me for example
uh it would be interesting no matter
what like even if he hated me you'd
still watch just to be mad at me
all right Lee Fang uh latest to write
about the Twitter files
he's the one who said that uh U.S
Central Command was using Twitter
to influence other countries
sure enough
um Robert F Kennedy Jr
tweeted this about Tucker's claim that
the CIA was involved with the Kennedy
assassination so this remember this is
Robert F Kennedy Jr and he says the most
courageous newscast in 60 years the
cia's murder of my uncle was a
successful coup d'etat from which our
democracy has never recovered
so Robert F Kennedy Jr
is completely accepting the CIA
involvement in his uncle's death
that's pretty Gussy yeah this is what
you're saying I'll say I I've not always
agreed with Robert F Kennedy Jr but I'm
no longer doubting his his braveness I
guess that question's been settled but
here's what Tucker did say and I'm going
to question your interpretation of it
um he said that he talked to a source
that he doesn't tell us
right so he has an unnamed source
how reliable is an unnamed source
close to zero right
close to zero but in this one case we're
not relying entirely on the source are
we because we're also relying on Tucker
to have vetted the source for us
which is a big that's a big trust right
because talker is the one who's telling
us
so if he's not good at vetting The
Source while you're in trouble if you
believe him if he's good at vetting The
Source then he's adding some credibility
like it might be somebody he knows
personally has known for a long time
might be somebody he knows is a straight
shooter
so so you have to put your credibility
on Tucker
which is one level like extended from
the source
so you're already in a little sketchy
territory right but let's say that you
believe Tucker would not lie about a
thing like that
and I think that's true
there's nothing about Tucker that would
suggest he would tell you some kind of
direct lie
or or even if it was a sketchy claim
that he would like spin in so it sounded
more believable than it was like he
doesn't really give off that vibe
but what was the exact thing that he
quoted his sources saying let me read it
to you quote yes comma I believe the CIA
was involved in the killing of Kennedy
do you see any Flags in that statement
I'll read it again really pay attention
to the exact wording yes I believe the
CIA was involved in the killing of
Kennedy
I believe and involved
those two words tell you that this
person does not have direct information
it's a belief
it's just a belief
and when he says the CIA was involved
that could mean absolutely anything
involves could mean anything
so I it sounds like a source who is
telling the truth
they were telling the truth
The Source personally believed
and it's probably also true probably
also true that in some way the CIA has
some involvement
which doesn't mean they knew it was
going to happen doesn't mean they caused
it I mean it might have been some
tangential involvement
um
yeah and maybe maybe the shooter was a
CIA agent at one point
or an asset
but that doesn't necessarily mean that's
why the assassination took place so
involved is doing a lot of lifting here
right
so
does Robert F Kennedy Jr know more than
Trump more than Tucker does
he have his own information he probably
does right don't you think that the
Kennedy family knows a little bit more
than you do about the whole thing
probably
so I don't know what to think about that
I don't discount the CIA involvement I
will just say that that's not an
Evidence
it's not an Evidence so Tucker saying
that somebody won't tell you about
believe something
was involved in something
has the the evidential value of zero
zero
I know I hate that I hate that I would
love for this to be credible
yeah and 60 years ago right right
how old is the guy who had Who had who
has knowledge of it 60 years ago
and and then Tucker made the uh claim
that I think is accurate that all of the
heads of the CIA
must know the truth
and he said that would include Mike
Pompeo
who he says you know Tucker says he has
a like a friendly good feeling about
but that that would implicate Pompeo as
one of the people who's hiding from you
the truth
now
here's what I think
would Pompeo not tell you the truth
do you think Pompeo would know that the
CIA was you know directly behind the
assassination do you think he would know
that from having been there and then
decided not to tell you
possible it's possible yep totally
possible because what I might do is uh
throw the CIA into such disarray that
you couldn't possibly lead it if the
first thing you did was tear it apart
that way
so it could be people making just
practical real world decisions that damn
it they'd love to love they'd love you
to know
but it would be so destructive to the
CIA that
for the good of the country you don't
want to destroy the CIA you can imagine
ahead of a CIA
having a complicated opinion about this
yeah yeah and there might be a sources
and methods issue too right
all right there is nothing funnier than
Trump's tax returns being available and
here's what we found
you know you know the ridiculous claim
that Trump was making
that he was waiting for the audit and
the audit was taking forever like you
didn't want to release his tax returns
until they had been audited
and what did you say to yourself well
that's the obvious lie you know nothing
takes that long
so here's what we found out
apparently the auditor said one one guy
aside to it
they've been working on it since 2015.
they've been working on his tax return
since 2015. and here's the funny part
they're not even close
they're nowhere near
being close to have examined them
because here's the funniest part
the people who prepare the taxes are
high-end accountants
the people who audit them are low end
functionaries and they don't even
understand them
the Auditors were so under trained that
they asked Trump's uh tax preparers if
they did it right and the tax preparers
said some version of oh yeah
we did this so right
you know I'm glad you asked we totally
nailed it
that was the audit
the audit was one untrained guy asking
Trump's accountants if they did it right
and them saying yeah we totally did this
right
and then then the remaining stuff is a
whole bunch of things for which they
have questions about
but they've had questions about forever
they don't seem to have any answers that
would be illegal
like nothing
there's absolutely nothing it is tax
returns so far nothing
I love this I love that there's
nothing in there now I'm not saying that
they won't find anything a big
complicated billionaire tax thing you'd
have to assume
that the accountants took some you know
obvious deductions
but if they're good accountants they
also took some gray areas
do you know why a good accountant would
take a deduction in a gray area
because that's what a good accountant
does
if there's an argument to be made you
don't go to jail
by the way did you know that if you have
a high high paid accountants
and they say to you you know
I could see that an audit would kick
this up but we have an argument for
doing it
you do not go to jail for that
there only has to be an argument from a
qualified person and then the IRS says
well we don't allow it so there's going
to be a penalty because we we didn't
allow it but if you have the right
accountants they take those deductions
because it's always better to take your
odd take your chances
if you have to pay back a 10 penalty for
a few years it's probably still a better
bat than not taking it all because we
can see in the in the in this specific
case that the Auditors they don't even
penetrate entire topics within it
because they're too complicated
so it'll be like specific deductions
like hundreds of millions of dollars
that change everything and and the
Auditors are like ah I don't even know
how to evaluate that because because you
would need a specialty
for each of these pockets and and the
Auditors are now specialists
and they didn't have any help
so it was actually true
that it was taking years to get audited
and it was all because the the IRS
didn't have the capability that is
hilarious
and literally not one confirmed illegal
thing in all of that from 2015 until now
having found a single thing that's sort
of an obvious problem the only things
they found are gray areas and yes those
accountants should have taken every one
of the gray areas everyone
so all they found so far is he has good
accountants that's it
bottom line summary oh turns out uh
Trump hires really good accountants
that's literally the whole story
that's the summary that's the only thing
they know
everything else is you know if we looked
into this area
maybe we'd find something wrong with it
that's it
maybe there'd be something wrong if we
looked into it and if we understood it
but we don't
that's it
so I don't know I love this part of the
story
um let's talk about Arizona and Maricopa
and Kerry Lakes
situation there
um
I have a conspiracy theory I'd like to
put into the mix
now I don't have direct evidence that
this is true
what I have is a pattern
and the pattern is this
do you remember when Sydney Powell was
making her ridiculous claims about the
voting machines
now just for a historical uh context I
did believe that she would have a kraken
in other words I did believe that when
she when she stood in front of the
public and said oh I have the goods
I believe she was credible and she would
not have made that claim unless she had
the goods
she did not
so I was a hundred percent wrong about
that
don't you love it when I tell you I'm
100 wrong
totally wrong but don't conflate that
don't conflate that with a related claim
that the voting machines themselves were
rigged when when I heard that claim if
you recall I said on Moment One
 there's no Venezuelan
General
this story is so obviously false
right confirm that when she came up with
the Venezuelan General story I said no
no no no like from the first moment I
said that's not true and it was not true
where do you think that rumor came from
where do you think the rumor that the
voting machines and there was a
Venezuelan General came from
is that the sort of thing that let's say
you'd hear from
[Music]
who
yeah
it might be exactly what you thought of
now why would why would somebody start a
rumor that the election was rigged
when those very people would want you to
believe the opposite why would they
start an election that was rigged when
they totally don't want you to think
that
because if they can draw all your
attention to the thing that is obviously
 that's all you'll remember
and every time that another claim is
made they'll say ah is it a kraken
is it a kraken
how about that last Kraken
pretty credible huh
sure you're full of Kraken Scott oh yeah
Carrie lake has a good claim this time
you sure so did Sydney Powell so did the
Kraken where's the Kraken where's the
Kraken Scott
to me it looks like an OP
so that's that's what I'm going to add
to the conspiracy theories to me it
looks like an obvious op
because if they knew they had been
caught red-handed this this would be a
speculation right if if the Democrats
knew they had been caught red-handed
how would they handle it they're totally
going to get caught rigging an election
hypothetically
they would create a false flag that
would draw all your attention
to a ridiculous claim of of election
fraud that could be easily disproven
would discredit Fox News totally which
is what's happening right now
and they would never have to answer for
it because it would take all the energy
to the thing that was
now who even who even has information
about a Venezuelan General
huh
who who in the government
would have information about a
Venezuelan General
there's only one place that
could have come from
there's only one place that came from
directly or indirectly
that's somebody who deals with other
countries on behalf of the United States
I mean I'm speculating
right I'm just speculating don't have
direct evidence but it sure looks like
an OP
this show looks like it
so that brings us back to Kerry Lake
and her claims among others are that
um from witnesses that the a lot of the
ballots were printed at the wrong size
so I guess the paper was the right size
but you can print on the paper a ballot
that's you know skinnier or fatter and
if you if you tell your machine to print
the wrong kind they won't be counted
through the machines and it blows up the
system which is what happens
now
why do you think or what do you think
was the cause of all those misprinted
ballots
well the people who run the elections
say oops
we made a mistake
and so far
that is not disproved
the the mistake hypothesis is not
disproved
it's just hard to believe
it's like really hard to believe because
uh apparently only an administrator
makes that change and all the machines
that have been tested the day before
or what did they test on the machines
did they test real ballots
maybe they had like test ballots and
they ran them through the machine but
the test ballots did not match the
actual ballots
how about whoever printed the ballots
was there anybody double checking to see
that the ballots had been printed and
that those ballots could go through a
machine
well here's where it gets a little
sketchy doesn't it
it feels like
it's the sort of thing that should have
been checked
right your common sense
says they would have checked the
printing they would have checked the
machines and then they would check the
printing with the machines and that all
of that would have been done the days
before the election and then once those
things are checked then nobody can touch
the machine again right very basic
Common Sense obvious process so do you
think elections uh match your common
sense obvious process well let me give
you a little more information of
something that happened in Maricopa now
this is based on witness testimony
that when the individual precincts
gather up all the ballots
and they send them to the central place
they don't count how many they have
before they send them
just think about that
they don't count how many they have
before they send them
now
if I had asked you
hey it's up to you to develop a system
would you have ever imagined that could
be true
because I've thought about it in the
past I thought I wonder I wonder if they
just compare the local totals to the
total totals to make sure they got all
the ballots and then you know what I
said to myself
I said I'm not going to raise that in
front of the public do you know why why
would I not ask that question in front
of you
because it would look made me look like
a idiot
of course they do that
of course the most obvious basic
maintenance
of security and an election would be you
count them at every step that anything
can be counted not just that step
but every every transfer from the
physical ballots to the machines
from the pile that's counted to another
source from that source to the storeroom
every time you move them you move them
with a count
everybody knows that
every one of you would have done it that
way
but experts actually testified
that it was their process
to not do the one thing you would need
as a citizen to trust your election
so one thing you need done like all the
other stuff is important too
but knowing that you said to all the
ballots to be counted
that's as basic as you can get
you can't get more basic than that
now
tell me
a second reason why they wouldn't do it
one re one reason would be it gives them
an opportunity for fraud
right that'd be one obvious reason what
would be another reason
too lazy
I don't think laziness is a factor
because when they hire people they tell
them what to do and they do all the
other stuff
you know all the being a poll worker is
like a lot of work they're the opposite
of lazy
aren't they I mean the the poll workers
look like they're really in there for
the right reasons they're putting in
they're putting in the hours
I don't think they're lazy you don't
think that if the rule came down these
must be counted before you send them
you don't think they would do that
now it might be hard
but if you don't do that you really
didn't have an election you could trust
so let me say this as clearly as
possible if that's true
that they're not counted at the precinct
level before they go to a central
accounting place then there was no
election
you can't even say there was an election
the only thing you could say for sure is
that there were a bunch of ballots that
got counted at the endpoint
if that's all you know and there's no
chain of custody
there was no election
see in the same way that I say you can't
judge Congress for doing a bad job
they're not doing any job
not doing any job likewise you cannot
say the election was uh
rigged or not rigged
there wasn't an election
I'm going to say that directly
if you didn't if you didn't control the
chain of custody and it wasn't a mistake
it was the process the actual process
was don't control
the number of votes
what would be what would you call an
election
where the process says don't count the
votes at important stages of the votes
it's not an election
what would that be
and this is an installation right so I
think that people who are election
deniers should be denying that an
election happened
not they shouldn't be denying the
outcome
so I would say If you deny the outcome
you're in sketchy territory if you say
well it's not really an election if
you're not counting the votes before you
send them to the central place then you
say all right well once again we had a
government that chose not to have an
election
now
I always accept the elections because
you need to move on so I accepted and I
did accept it on day one and continue to
accept it but there was no election
there was no election
if that fact is true
there was no election
true or false
I see nobody disagree with me
right 100 agreement because this this is
not politics
right if if you said to a Democrat you
put a democrat in the room say oh here's
the process
now get all these ballots and then we
send them to a central place but we
don't count them before we send them
do you think there's a Democrat even one
who would say okay that sounds like a
valid election
anybody this has nothing to do with
politics it wouldn't matter who won who
didn't win
not counting the ballots
at that important stage of the process
is no election at all none at all
the legislator makes the rules so they
need to plug the holes probably
but
just because the states can run the
elections any way they want
so that would make it legal that doesn't
mean that they chose to do it
so in other words the fact that the
state has a right to run an election
according to their own laws
that doesn't mean they did it
means they did something but I wouldn't
call it an election
I would Now call that an election
it was something else
by wouldn't call it fraud
see here's where you go wrong if you
call it fraud that you're accepting
there was something like an election
that happened
I don't see it
you can't have a fraud of an election
that didn't happen
you can just have something that didn't
happen
so I think we keep getting fooled into
thinking that our government is doing a
good or bad job and then we argue it
oh I think it was good I think it was
bad
nothing like that's happening
there's actually just no governing
happening
so the only complaint you should have is
that no governing is happening
such wise double talk Scots you can
avoid being a Joe Blow
it's like
oh somebody's asking you if I'm a denier
yes
yes as of yesterday
so as uh before yesterday I was not an
election denier because I didn't have
evidence
that you know seemed incredible but now
we have a court testimony from somebody
who was in the right place that the way
the process worked
was not close enough to being an
election
so I can say now I can say based on that
based on that no election happened
so yeah I would be I would be an
election denier but not not the standard
kind I'm not denying just the outcome
I'm denying the election itself
that the election itself was just
smoking mirrors and no no actual
election happened
nothing like that happened
so
let's see if I get demonetized because
I'm saving as directly as you could
based on yesterday's court evidence
court evidence it looks like no election
happened by my definition of what would
be the minimum requirement to say an
election happened we didn't hit the
minimum
so will I be gone tomorrow
do you think there's somebody at YouTube
right now who's having a real tough time
with me or they will when the human
reviews us because this will be
demonetized in half a second that's why
I'm going to rumble
um
but I'm saying is directly as directly
as you can say
no election happened I deny the election
but I do accept the outcome
I do accept the outcome because
you have to you have to have some
stability you have to move forward now
we need to fix this so it doesn't happen
again
you've got to do that but I can deny the
election now with with uh no no qualms
yes Joe Blow I am a denier that is
correct
as of today
but but I'll defend myself from holding
off till now because this is the first
highly credible information I've seen
that tells me it wasn't a real election
somebody says you can't accept the
results
uh well that that makes the word accept
and do too much work
I can decide to move on so that the
country doesn't come to a screeching
halt which is different from accepting
the results you can accept the system
without accepting the results
uh the legislation is fine it was not a
following somebody says that seems more
likely but I don't I don't know that
that's proven does anybody know if
uh Maricopa was legally required to
count them before they sent them to the
Central site
do we have a fact check on that
I see some yeses but are you using
common sense or you just or did you see
it factually
common sense says of course they're
required
but I don't know if it's factually true
has it been demonstrated
it was stated in the trial somebody says
okay
all right good if it uh now what would
you do if you're the court
it's a real good question suppose the
court accepts the testimony as true
uh is it is it a jury trial
or a judge trial is it it's a judge
trial right it's a bench judge law so
suppose the judge accepts that it was
legislatively required
that they count them at the precinct
level
but they didn't do it
at this late stage of the game even if
all the facts are accepted could that
judge reverse anything
or is it not that late
could he order a redo
I I think I think they can order a redo
but you think it would happen at this
late date
Katie Hobbs has now sworn in yet
is that true
you could call it runoff
interesting okay well and is the judge
do we know which way the judge leans
Republican or Democrat
is the judge a leaner or we don't know
anything about the judge
judge is Republican
are you sure
cernovich says a redo
the judges are impartial yeah
courts have ordered new elections before
but if they ordered it in a senate
election
or a governor election and they has it
been ordered at the highest level
I feel like that's something that
happens to like a state representative
or something
yes in Arizona okay
all right so it is possible so one
possibility is that uh there could be a
redo
because the evidence is sort of leaning
in that direction
how long hair oh interesting
uh
it was a super super Scott what
there is precedent at the governor's
level somebody says all right well I
would accept that I'll accept that if if
the
but but let me ask you this is there
precedent only when fraud was proven
or is there precedent when you don't
know if fraud happened but it might have
that is different because if the judge
says well there definitely was an
opening for fraud because the way you
handled it
but you can't prove it
if you can't prove it nobody can't order
a redo
do you think you could do you think a
judge could order a redo absent crime
and it's the only procedure
could he
maybe not
uh he would say no intent
yeah if there's no intention and no
proof of a crime
he'd probably just say Let It Go and fix
it next time wouldn't he
I feel like that's what I would do if I
were a judge
like even if I were sure that this is
sketchy as hell but it's not proven it's
just sketchy as hell I'd say all right
you're gonna have to live with it better
fix it next time that's what I would do
which I hate like I hate that that's how
I would decide
but that's what I do
because I think the judges try to take a
you know a larger view of social
disruption and I don't think I would
probably wouldn't disrupt the system
for this
like it's an edge case I mean you could
certainly make an argument for it
certainly
but I think a judge is going to go the
other way
uh what are the real smart lawyers say
that's a good question
why does defense keep asking Witnesses
if they have evidence of intent
because intent matters
um
Barnes was laughing it up
so what would you assume about Trump's
claims of the election being rigged if
you found out
that this election we don't know if it's
rigged but the votes weren't counted at
the precinct level
and it got overturned because of that
I have a feeling that Kerry lake is
going to prove Trump right without
proving he's right
in other words your brain if if Kerry
Lake prevails and let's say she actually
goes all the way and becomes Governor
totally possible if she prevails what
are you going to think about Trump's
claims of election fraud
you're gonna totally believe them
because it would be hard to believe that
Maricopa only acted in this election and
only against Kerry Lake it'd be hard to
believe that
uh cernovich says it's different the
Trump situation versus like yes so I'm
agreeing that these are different
situations so her proving her case does
not prove trumps what I'm saying is in
your brain it will
in your brain it will totally prove it
it will in mine right you know if Kerry
Lake prevails even though it's different
evidence and different case from Trump
that would be enough for me to say oh
Trump's probably right
probably right
I I would I would just go completely to
that side if Carrie Lake wins if she
doesn't win and doesn't prove any any
impropriety then I'm going to say well
Trump's had a long time to make his case
and he hasn't done it
but if she wins even though it's all
different from Trump I agree with that
my brain won't let me release on that my
brain will say all right
if if every time somebody says I suspect
something and you look into it and you
find it
I'm just going to look at that pattern
and say well
I doubt that's a coincidence that every
time there's a complaint you find the
actual crime there
uh Mass mail-in leads to custody issues
which leads to fraud in both cases is
the case
okay I see what you're saying there
yeah the chain of custody stuff has been
proven as a problem
but ignored
yeah
I think that's what's going to happen
again
uh all right this is a long live stream
and I don't even know if it's a good one
because I'm talking about some topics
you've heard about too many times so
um YouTube I'm gonna say goodbye I'm
gonna go talk to the locals people
privately
and thanks for joining
