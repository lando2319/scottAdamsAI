[Music]
good morning everybody
and what a bunch of champions you are
yeah you are
now it may be that you haven't won any
actual competitions
but that's only because you haven't
tried imagine if you tried
wow the things you could do
and
i don't think that i'm going out on a
limb here by saying
you're better looking than ever
and today we're going to have an amazing
live stream
or recorded session as you prefer
and all you need to take this to the
next level
to the dopamine level that well people
only dreamed about
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
a tanker chelsea stein a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine hit of the day it's the thing
that makes everything better it's called
that's right the simultaneous sip go
oh i felt
i felt i was starting to get some
cooties
and that just cleared it all up
um
i have some
news about a study
it says that uh drinking coffee can cure
covered
cures covered
there was only one person in the study
group that was me
and i've never had covet
so
i guess we got some proof there
well here's a uh
a real story there was a truck
that was loaded uh
with a lot of copies of rogue to soros
and do you know why i said
there was a truck that was filled with
copies of rogue
thesaurus
thesaurus
because i don't know the plural of
thesaurus
so i'm going to do the same thing that
this tweet did
i don't want to say
to sore i
but it because it feels like that's what
it should be and i don't want to say to
sources
because that just sounds like
something's going on with your mouth
like you're eating candy
uh whether when they drop in the road
what the taurus
the the swords
so that doesn't even sound like it's a
word
so let's just say there were thousands
of copies of
rogue
r-o-g-e-t
anyway here's the tweet a truck loaded
with thousands of copies of rogue gets
to saurus spilled its load
leaving new york witnesses uh oh in new
york
uh witnesses were stunned startled
aghast stupefied confused shock rattled
paralyzed as would bewildered surprised
dumbfounded flabbergasted confounded
astonished and numbed
excellent tweet from a user named doc
good work doc
but
was it tesori
i think it was
well i told you that i was going to
introduce a
a regular black character in the dilbert
universe
now of course there have been characters
of color in the dilbert universe before
but within the
main cluster of the regulars
there was a shook
who was born in india
but that was it
so
and i always wanted to make the cast
look more like
the readers
and so i added this uh new black
character i think it's next week that it
runs
starting monday i believe
and it's a dave
his name will be dave
and of course the hard thing about
having a black character if you're a
white author is how do you do it
respectfully
but also
comically because those those two things
don't fit
how can you be respectful
at the same time
as being humorous you kind of can't do
it really so you have to find some kind
of a
a personality characteristic
that you can give
your character
that will keep you on that let's say
dangerous fence but without falling off
now this is something that i would not
have dared to do
earlier in my career
because the odds of me getting canceled
for this
pretty good what evidence do i have that
there's a good chance i'll be getting
cancelled
for trying to make my comic strip more
diverse
in a respectful way
yes i will get canceled for that already
a substantial newspaper chain has said
they won't run the comic
so it's already been it's already been
uh
censored i guess you'd say now by
private industry not by government but
yeah one one newspaper chain now you may
not notice that because there's a chain
that owns mostly smaller newspapers
but
i don't know if that will be the last
newspaper chain that cancels this one
so we'll see
now the approach i took was to have the
dilbert characters and dilbert's boss
deal with the new character
uh the way real people would deal with
the situation
so it's just that that's all it is so
it's pretty innocent there's nothing
there that
i would say i didn't put anything there
that i thought would even be
cancelable
you know because it has to run in
newspapers so it's not going to be that
provocative
um we'll see this would be a good test
case
if it turns out that i get
you know cancelled because of this
i don't mind going down that way
that would be sort of a good way to
retire
yeah i'm at that point in my career
where if somebody offered me enough
money to buy dilbert the ip
i would say well
if it's enough i would retire tomorrow
but i won't i won't stop doing this
but i can easily stop doing the comic
all right
um did you see the video of jim acosta
trying to accost
what are the odds of that
that his name is jim acosta
and part of his job is accosting people
is that is that a coincidence that's
weird
but he was a accosting he was jim
acosting
uh marjorie taylor green
and he was asking her why did she
say something in a tweet
and it doesn't even matter what the
content is
because the story is not about the
content
so he makes an accusation then she
pushes back
and she basically says
if you're saying that you'd like me to
answer for what i said in a tweet show
me the tweet
i want to see the exact words of the
full tweet and then i'll respond to it
and he tries to
just
essentially explain the tweet again she
says no
no
i you know and then basically she goes
right after him for his fake news
approach
and she goes no you're going to show me
the actual tweet the full tweet or else
we're not going to talk about it
and he fumbles around with this phone
all right all right i'll just show you
the tweet and then he should that he
comes up with an article
about the tweet
and she says no
no
not an article about the tweet
the tweet the full tweet
nothing cut out the entire tweet just
read it to me and then i'll answer your
question
he couldn't do it
because when he did find the tweet it
very clearly didn't say what he was
asking her to respond to it very clearly
was a you know she hedged something just
the way you would want something hedged
and
to watch her bust him
like so
so clearly to show how
um
yeah just i mean really the story was
supposed to be about her poorly
answering the question right
that was supposed to be the story the
story was that the way he asked the
question is the story and then her
response would be no comment or that's
what you expect in these
kinds of interviews but instead she
basically just pushed him up against the
wall
made made her made him prove to the
world that he was shooting blanks and
that he was just full of
and then she moved on and i have to say
i had not really been following her much
at all and i know she said a bunch of
provocative things that i if i looked
into them i probably would not agree
with
i don't even know what she said but uh
horrible provocative things i'm told
so let's just assume i wouldn't agree
with that stuff whatever it is i just
don't know what it is
but
i have to admit i kind of get it now
like i was trying to understand why she
was popular at all
you know because i try to understand
that about everybody like why why is
this person more popular and then i saw
that
and what it was was pure power
she actually just knows how to wield
power
now
is that
is that good well it depends if you
agree with her you know if you don't
agree with her i guess that's that's bad
but
but to watch her
just dissect this guy while the cameras
were rolling was actually a treat like i
i enjoyed it in a in a way that i'm not
proud of right a little dopamine hit
and i thought wow she actually she
actually does have the goods i can i can
see how she got elected even though i
don't align with the reviews i'm pretty
sure
all right
can you believe
that we're still talking about the uh
drinking bleach
hoax and aaron rupar brought that up
again so he's talking about it again on
twitter
and but this time this time enough
people have been trained
about how to respond to that hoax that
you all have links
so people started sending in links to
the company that was actually
injecting a disinfectant into the lungs
the injection method was like a
ventilator goes down the trachea
and the
and the disinfectant was uv light
exactly what trump said
it was injected into the lungs
in this case they were injecting it into
the trachea
but the the talk was about you know
extending it
so there was talk about extending it and
trump was talking
hypothetically like he was speculating
could you
in theory inject it into the lungs
because it was already being injected
into a trachea so
you know a little bit of a
tweak and maybe you can get some kind of
a
device all the way into the lungs so
that was actually being talked about
and
so what happens when
when aaron rupar is presented
with what would be
in theory one of the most embarrassing
fact checks ever because he's he's
talked about this publicly before
so it would be kind of a kind of a bad
fact check the effect check in public
with a source
and and i even uh tweeted at him a a
wall street journal article
by i think he was the president or one
of the founders
of that technology
who said that he knew that the president
was talking about their technology
so it's the guy's actual company
and he confirms that yes
they can inject light down into the
at least into the trachea and then yes
that's what the president was talking
about he recognized it immediately
now
uh i recognized it immediately too
because i've been tweeting about that
very technology
you know right before
and right before the president talked
about it
so
we know exactly where it came from the
idea
it came from that technology that was
being trialled at cedars-sinai i don't
think it worked out by the way but it
was being trialled
and
so what what would happen if you were
confronted with this completely
unambiguous
evidence
well at first aaron when rupaul went
with the
he said he tweeted injected uh
is the cute
he said injected is the key word
basically big difference he said
injected so he was trying to make the
case that it couldn't be talking about
light
if he would use the word injected
but then you look at the technology and
you see that it's literally ejected
and i guess the
the the youtube
videos that this company had up on
youtube
were taken down
do you know why
i don't think they do because it was an
actual trial
it was a legitimate trial
to try to
uh
the only reason i could think that it
was taken down is that it would make
it would make the hoax be more obvious
because if you could just link to the
video people would say oh
that does look exactly like injecting a
disinfectant
that happens to be uv light
yeah that i think that's exactly example
of the censorship
that elon musk talks about
so it's kind of amazing so
after
after the injected part was debunked and
after the
the fact that it was obviously he was
talking about light
that got debunked by just showing the
full transcript instead of the edited
part you could tell that trump was
always talking about light
aaron rupar just goes silent
and you have to wonder what's going on
did did he get his mind changed
or
or or does the brain not allow you to
see that final piece of evidence the the
part that would have changed the mind
does the brain just prevent you from
changing your mind cognitive dissonance
and so i'm actually genuinely curious
if i could talk to him in person and i'd
say okay
all right so now that you've been down
this well
and you know exactly that he always
talked about light he said light he
never said bleach
he said injected but that's actually
what was being discussed
now that you've walked him down that
what would he say
now do you believe that he he know he
knew all along and he's just lying
because he doesn't really act like it
he doesn't really act like he's lying
he acts like he believed that the
president actually said that
but you know it could be an act i i
can't really read people's minds so i'm
actually curious
does he still actually believe
that the president suggested injecting a
disinfectant like a liquid disinfectant
yeah
and then then when other people in the
uh the comments
uh hear the debunk which is
devastatingly completely
you know 100 effective debunk
they say well
that can be true because the president
said he was just being sarcastic
why would he do that
to which i say
well how did it work out the first time
he talked about it
it didn't work out
why would he do the same thing that
didn't work out twice
so he mentioned something that was a
real technology
they should have been fine it should
have actually shown that he was ahead of
ahead of the
journalists because he would have known
something they didn't know at that time
so he should have worked out fine it
should have been a case of him knowing
something people didn't know
instead it turned out to this big
embarrassing thing
so i would imagine he would not want to
do exactly what he did before because
you know what the the journalist would
say
even if he said no i was talking about
light technology
they would say he's doubling down
that's what they'd say they wouldn't say
oh he's talking about this real
technology
no they'd say he's doubling down
on injecting
bleach
there's no way to win
so if he knew there was no way to win
and i think that would have been the
right instinct
he could have just said i was just
joking to just try to make it go away
so there's a perfectly reasonable reason
he would try to make it go away because
there's no way to win
as long as the media was going to say
anything they wanted
the best he could do is just make less
of it just say i was kidding make it go
away
that's not the way i would have handled
it probably
i think i would have made a run at
defending it
but who knows that's that's why i'm not
president
um
good observation from uh
twitter user jason andrews
who notes that elon musk's uh recent
tweeting now that he
he's uh going to own the company it
looks like
um
is what i used to call the or still do
the new ceo move
so the new ceo move is whatever the new
ceo does in the first weeks because that
defines who they are
your first impression tells everybody
who you are and then that lasts
so you don't always have to be
an outrageous version of that person
you could just set an example
do something a little theatrical that
says who you are and then
that defines you for the rest of your
term
and it does look like musk is either
intentionally or not but it's working
out that way he's doing the new ceo move
with his tweets because he's very
clearly laying out
his free speech
position he's very clearly laying out
that he's never going to take unserious
he's never going to take things that
don't matter seriously
like he just laughs at things
that are like dumb criticisms and stuff
so the fact that he thinks it's funny
that people are criticizing him in such
a poor way
he's actually rating their criticisms
i think he gave
he said he would give the washington
post criticisms of him
a bad review on yelp it just wasn't done
very well
and and he just laughs at the whole
thing while he goes ahead and changes
the world
and
i thought yeah that's that's uh
that's exactly what's going on and if i
were to add something to that
here's what i would add
so right now he's getting some heat
for being uh too aligned with the
political right
but
he says he's not he says he's where he
always was
but the left moved left and then there's
a big debate on twitter did that really
happen or did the right move right and
the left move left and you know
everybody's got their opinions i'm not
sure i care too much about that
i think it's fair that they're
you know we hear from more extreme
people on the left and the right
so that part's true
but here's what i would do
if i were the new ceo if i were the musk
and well i don't think you'll be ceo but
let's say owner
i would do this
i would uh
i would say in public
what the biggest hoaxes were
on the left and the right
i would just explain
because if he says that people will
listen if i say it they just don't have
to follow me on twitter
they just block me but if he says that
they they just sort of have to listen
because you can't not listen to him he's
got the trump magic now if he talks
everybody's going to hear it
so anything he says
can break that
that bubble
and almost nobody else can
he has a unique bubble bursting position
in the world right now uh that gives him
all kinds of power is sort of like the
jim manchin thing is it jim
what what is mansion's first name
senator manchin
it's like the mansion thing
joe i'm sorry joe manchin joe mansion
it's like that
i don't think joe mentioned woke up and
said oh i want to be the swing vote and
then i'll control everything but that's
how it worked out
right
and i don't think elon musk
woke up and said oh i'm going to be the
one person in the world
who can be heard by the left and the
right
but he is
you know i don't think that was a plan
at all i think it was just purely
accidental he was just sort of being
himself
and he suddenly finds himself the only
person who can he can pierce both
bubbles
and so it would be fun to see him do it
have him pierce both bubbles because
that would really tell you who he is
if he's really for free speech
and he's against
misinformation
then i think he should give
us a little free speech
his own
and tell us what he thinks was a hoax
and what wasn't
but
it's got to be on both sides
and i was wondering okay
you know i'm so in my own bubble this is
this is like a
this is a brain check for your for
ourselves so do what i'm doing right now
if if you uh
if you like this way of maintaining your
uh maybe any semblance of rational
thought
just consider how much of a bubble you
might be in
right because i'm doing that right now
and and here's where i hit the wall of
my bubble
and i didn't realize i was running
really hard into a wall until i hit it
so i went to
i started making a mental list of all
the hoaxes on the left i'm like all
right the fine people hoax the the you
know the drinking bleach
and i you know you can come up come up
with like
eight to ten hoaxes they're gigantic
laptop
russian collusion you just go on and on
with all those hoaxes
but then i said all right all right but
just to be fair
clearly there are just as many on the
other side
so i started to make my list
of outright hoaxes now we're not talking
about lies
we're not talking about lies or just
being wrong
i'm talking about something that was
clearly a hoax
right something that even the people
reporting it they knew it wasn't true
or at least someone
right and i started to make my list and
i couldn't really think of anything
recently
you can think of things but you have to
go back to like yeah weapons of mass
destruction and
you know
uh
pizzagates sort of a
special case that's not exactly a
republican thing
um but
but help me out here
what would be let's say in last
let's say since the beginning of trump's
rise
what would be
from the beginning of trump on what
would be some examples of hoaxes
like major fake news that that lived for
a long time
that was uh something perpetrated by the
right
q anon
i know it was q q no
q anon feels like a
just a subgroup it doesn't really feel
like that's the right does it
do do you think of q being associated
with the right
i mean they are
but it feels
it feels a lot more like it's a
subgroup
oh uh okay there's one the uh
dominion voting machines and the
venezuelan
venezuelan dictator
okay that's a good one
obama birth certificate that's old
yeah i'm looking for something that sort
of happened
from the beginning of the trump
2015-2016 era
yeah so the kraken is a good example we
got that one i i guess we could throw q
in there
but
q is so many things like so many topics
that one's a little it's a weird one
oh yeah
pizzagate was during okay all right i'll
give you a piece of gate
uh the wall
um
well part i mean you'd have to be more
specific about the wall
um
all right so
there you have it so here here's what i
would uh recommend i would love to hear
somebody ask
elon musk
um what he thought of maybe maybe show
up with a list
because you'll you'll probably do a
bunch of podcasts don't you think
you know the high high impact uh podcast
uh and by the way elon musk if you're
listening to this live stream and why
wouldn't you i'm a dog
um
i invite you
to uh
do an interview
i'm not sure how i do that i'll find you
somehow i'll bring my ipad we'll work it
out
anyway
um
we can talk about the simulation
so that's what i do i'd love to see him
debunk the left and the right
and
then you know where he stands because
here's the thing if if somebody is
willing to put up 44 billion dollars
i guess it's
you know credit but you know what i mean
if somebody's willing to go this far
into the twitter thing because of free
speech don't you think he has a point of
view
of what things besides the hunter's
laptop which he's already talked about
don't you think he has a mental list
of what things were fake news
and wouldn't you like to hear that list
because what it what if he thinks things
that are true were fake
that'd be scary
right
so what it what if he told you what he
believed was true and false and you
listened to it you said
uh
is he believing a lot of things that
aren't true
because that would be scary as hell
or how about the opposite how about
there are things that you are positive
or true and elon musk says
now i looked into that there's no way
that's true and you're going to say to
yourself wait what
i was positive that was true
what's that going to do to you
it would be awesome just to see what
happens
there's a graph going around twitter
about
democrats versus republicans and
trusting
scientists or trusting the scientific
community and it showed that right
around 2016 what was happening about
then
democrats
zoomed up in how much they trust the
scientific community
at the same time that the republicans
you know went to the
lowest levels of how much they've
trusted the scientific community so so
there's this giant gap that just formed
about the time that trump was elected
so
what how do you explain that
what would be could you put it in like
one one sentence
how do you explain it
russia no not russia
because i'm not talking about experts
i'm talking about scientific community
um yeah somebody says it's not
restricted to just the scientific
community so
i would say that mainly what happened is
that the way the
um scientific community
uh treated trump
and the way the
fake news
treated all of it
was such that the democrats were
brainwashed by their own media
to think that the science was always
right
because that could mean that trump was
more wrong
so they had to build up science
to make that contrast with those those
ignorant trump supporters
i think that's all that happened so when
i tell you that the news assigns
opinions
here it is
it
did you wonder if that was a hyperbole
when i you know i've been saying for
years that people don't form opinions
the opinions are assigned
they're assigned by the news
the news tells you okay you're a
democrat here's what you think they
don't say it directly
but pretty directly
i mean you can't miss the you can't miss
what they're saying
and so
uh yeah there's a there's a genetic
component here but mostly
um people are just being fed their
opinions
and that's just the starkest example as
soon as the news told people the
scientific community was more awesome
than they'd ever imagined they believed
it and when the people watching other
news
were told that the experts were all live
they believed that
so they were both assigned their
individual
opinions now is one of them right
yes
one of them is more right than the other
meaning that somebody
we either should be trusting them more
or should be trusting them less but i
doubt it's exactly the same
i i feel like
you know there should be a lot more or a
lot less but it'd be hard to argue that
it should just stay the same
well
you've heard about this new
disinformation board
that biden administration is going to
have
and i have to agree with dana perino who
said this on the five
did they not ask anybody for an opinion
before they rolled this out
was there not one person who leaned a
little bit to the right
who could have told them that
the disinformation board would be
instantly instantly and universally
labeled
the new ministry of truth from 1984.
how did they not see that coming
it was the most obvious thing that could
have happened right and i don't think it
was like it's not like one person
thought of it and said hey
hey
this is reminding me of that obscure
book 1984
and that new ministry of truth thing
and
i i mean seriously
probably a million people had exactly
the same idea when they saw ministry of
truth oh my god it's finally here i had
no idea that things had gotten so
bad when i saw this story that
the thing that
i kept shaking my head over is
is this real
like i'm trying to imagine how the
meeting went like you can't even wrap
your head around
this is actually real
actually
greatly
and as other people have asked
how is this going to work
what exactly do they do
are they going to fact check us because
that's not going to work
because they're you know partisans
so what is it how's it going to work
but uh you know and a lot of people are
uh giving a lot of grief to the person
who was hired to be the head of this
disinformation board
because apparently she has been
let's say associated with some
disinformation herself as well as
uh
bad singing
now actually she sings pretty well but
apparently she's like
singing show tunes
with political words
uh so she's definitely not
she's not one to be embarrassed
she she apparently handles embarrassment
well because she's quite a ham
i like that part about her actually
but
i don't think she's going to last
because of all the
the bad press she's getting
but there is a report that the biden
administration is going to hire someone
else to replace her already
they're looking at the amber turd
to be the new minister of truth
and one of the spokespeople explained it
this way
quote if america is going to the
bed
we wanted someone with experience
so amber turd would be
kind of perfect for that
so
we'll see if that happens or is it fake
news
you never know
you never know
well um speaking of amber turd
um the liar and blackmailer according to
what we hear in
the media
according to the trial
she sought a plush payoff
from johnny depp in exchange for
basically not blackmailing him
uh no or well actually just was
blackmail in exchange for
not going public with their troubles
now
let me ask you this
how in the world does she ever get work
again
after this
like what what director would say
i think i'll take a chance on this
i am i don't see any problem
i mean
there probably are other actresses
are there not other other women who can
pull off a leading role or something
so
it makes you wonder
now
i've said that
amber turd is not
she's not like somebody who's got some
personality problems
she's probably in this category of the
borderline personality disorder
vulnerable narcissist
hysterical whatever there's a bunch of
words for it
but these people are monsters they will
do anything to anybody they have no no
conscious whatsoever and
the speculation from the experts
is that they're not born that way
but that there's some kind of early
trauma
some some kind of trauma that turned
them into
essentially monsters
and
i'm gonna i'm just gonna go on record as
doubting that to be true
i do not believe
that the people who fall into these
categories the amber turd-like people i
don't believe that trauma is what caused
them to be like that
i do believe they had trauma
in many cases
because almost everybody did
have you met somebody who didn't have
any trauma
i haven't so the first thing is doesn't
everybody have trauma
now if you say but it's a special kind i
say yeah even that special kind you know
the
the sexual
um abuse of all kinds you know every
category thereof
but unfortunately isn't that two out of
three women or higher or four out of
five is that there's some there's some
like scary outrageous number
of ordinary women who have had
insanely bad experiences
in that domain
but they don't all turn into this kind
of person
and here's what i think i think the
early trauma story is actually just
another lie by the people who are
who only lie
so the people who have this
personality checklist the amber turned
checklist if i called that
they are liars
and so what if what if all the people
who are liars and accuse other people
and and part of their checklist of
behaviors is blaming other people for
whatever they're accused of
so they're always blamers of other
people don't you think that they went in
and talked to their psychiatrist at one
point and said
uh yeah i did i did all these terrible
things
you know why am i like this and the
psychiatrist just said well
tell me about your early life and then
they tell them about the abuse because
there almost always is some
and then the psychiatrist says
every time i talk to somebody with this
personality type they've got this abuse
very strong correlation so it's probably
the abuse that's causing them to be like
that
i don't think so
i don't think so i'm not buying any of
that i think that they are like that and
that
it's nice to have an excuse
a way to blame it on somebody else so to
me it looks like just more of who they
are
everything they do is doing horrible
things and blaming other people for it
that's all they do
all day long
they're doing horrible things and
blaming other people for it
this is just another one of those
that's all it is and to imagine that
you've discovered some great correlation
when it's basically something that's
happened unfortunately to just about
every female
and do you think that
people are more likely to do this if
they're attractive
do you think people are more likely to
get away with the amber turd-like
behavior
if they're attractive
yes
yes
now here
this will get me canceled but i think
you can handle it
if they are attractive are they more
likely to have been victimized by men at
some point in their past
yes
so there's your correlation
your correlation is that attractive
people tend to
be more amber turn-like because they can
get away with it
nobody else could get away with it this
is my big dog small dog
breeding
example
have you noticed that small dogs don't
behave
like that's a thing it's hard to train a
small dog
relative to a big dog do you know why
why is it why is it easy to train a big
dog but hard to train a small dog
because if a big dog misbehaves you kill
it
you don't let it breathe
you're not gonna let some big ass
dangerous dog
create more big ass dangerous dogs so
probably throughout history if you had a
big dog and it was a problem you killed
it
right
so big dogs have probably been bred
to be human friendly
where small dogs didn't really need it
right small dog bites your ankle you're
like ah
i mean you wouldn't even think
not to let it breed and you wouldn't
think to kill it you think ah
right
so
um
in the same way i think that uh
these narcissists are kind of kind of
bred because if you were
if you were a man
and you acted the way amber turd acted
i think you'd be in jail already right
am i wrong
a man would be in jail for doing half of
the stuff that she's done
um so i think it you get the attractive
ones or the ones who seem to be drawn to
this but it's only because they could
get away with it that's it that's the
whole thing
all right here's another story that
doesn't sound real
i i swear to god this next thing is not
a joke
if you haven't heard this story yet
you're gonna swear i'm making this up
the fda on monday
uh approved rem deserver
for children 28 days and older
does that sound real
like do i even need to get into the
details of that like i'm not the one who
tells you that remnant is either good or
bad but
i do know the pandemic's over
and i do know that young kids weren't at
much risk before and they're certainly
not now
and i do know that rem deserver was at
one point
a proven approved dish and then less
approved
because there were some dangers there
were some questions about the efficacy
versus the risk
how in the world does this get approved
and and even if even if the numbers
support it
like
it just doesn't sound real
it just sounds you know what it sounds
like
it sounds like we either we're in a
simulation and this is how we're finding
out
because the the reality is just so
stupid
that you just say okay okay i know this
is this has got to be a prank
this is either a scripted situation
or the the code is glitching because
there's a
you know maybe there's a
some kind of capacity problem so they're
just reusing
dumb ideas or something
but i mean this doesn't even look real
am i wrong like when you hear this story
rem deserve here for little kids
now
maybe i guess i'm not seeing much
agreement so maybe you don't agree with
that all right rasmussen had a poll
talking about uh
musk taking over twitter
here's a key number 43 of those surveyed
said they're more likely to use twitter
now than musk owns it
while only 19 said they're less likely
did elon musk just make one of the best
investments ever
that the only thing he needed to
increase the number of users
substantially was to be the owner
and then tweet a bunch of stuff about
free speech and then suddenly
massively people would come onto the
platform
is that all it took
did he literally just tweet himself
another
uh half a trillion dollars
i i feel like he did
i feel like he just tweeted himself up
another well he paid 44 billion
i think it'll double in value but by the
way
you know i currently
own twitter until the sale goes in i
guess i own some stock so i guess that
doesn't matter at this point because
whatever happens to my stock is gonna is
independent of anything i say or do
but wow
62 percent of american adults also
according to rasmussen
believe musk purchase will make twitter
better
okay
uh and only 13 think musk's purchase of
twitter will make it worse
well 12 percent uh don't think it'll
make much difference let's say 13
so the people who think it would be
better
if you take them out see that would
leave the people who don't know if it
would be better or think it will be
worse so say the 13 percent think it
would be worse
twelve percent think
may not won't make much difference so
if you were to add the thirteen and the
twelve uh that's a
it's a thirteen and twelve that's a it's
twenty-five twenty-five percent so about
25
25
25
25
exactly the number you get everything
wrong on every poll
of course i don't tell you the ones
where the 25 thing doesn't work
but it's so funny how often it does
if you're just catching up to this i
always make fun of the fact that 25
of the people answering any poll
will get obviously the wrong answer
just like obviously the wrong answer
and here it is
how in the world is elon musk going to
make twitter worse
and how in the world is it not going be
how in the world would it stay the same
you'd really have to be uninformed to
think it's gonna stay the same or get
worse
like
yeah the only way i can imagine that is
if the internal sabotage is so great
that there's nothing left for elon to
take over
meanwhile the gdp
fell 1.4 percent
uh
that's uh not good
not good
i think it's almost time for me to
recontact my liberal friend who i just
couldn't stand speaking to during the
entire trump administration
because he finally got the ideal
candidate he wanted he got his joe biden
and
he got his
he got what he wanted
higher crime higher taxes higher
inflation falling gross domestic product
possible
nuclear war with russia
so
debacle getting out of afghanistan so he
got what he wanted and i'm thinking
you see
is he almost primed that i could have a
conversation with him
about
the pro and con
of trump versus biden
do you think he's ready
no no of course he's not
i'm just kidding
of course he's not
not even close
well uh trump got on truth social so
it's his own uh
his own network
but uh everybody was waiting for him to
tweet and he did and his first tweet was
all in caps i'm back and then hashtag
kaffi
now uh and that thrilled his people and
i guess that's what part of what drove
truth social
uh
high up on the list because you knew
trump was gonna tweet pretty soon
so
um i have i have now tweeted untruth
um i have
thousands of followers following me
already
and
so we'll see what happens with that i
have to say the interface is pretty good
the
the
truth interface
um pretty clean pretty smooth they did
actually it's a good job i mean it's
obviously derivative of twitter but in a
good way it's smooth and it works so
that's on the uh on the apple still
waiting for the uh the android version
all right
um
here's another tipping point potential
for ukraine and russia so i've told you
that the russian ukraine thing is going
to be a war of tipping points but we
don't know one which which one will tip
because there's so many tipping points
that are near
such as
which military runs out of food
they're both close
to something that looks like they could
run out of food does one run out first
that could be a tipping point same with
the ammunition same with fuel
if any of them ran out of any of those
three things food fuel ammunition
then that's a tipping point and it's
over
how about a number of
drones or number of tanks there's some
number of drones that will kill some
number of tanks that that too would be a
tipping point
right how many tanks could russia lose
before they say okay
we just can't do anything here
right
if they lost 25 that's probably not
enough
but suppose they lost 50 of all their
tanks
is there any number that would makes
them say okay
okay
it seems that we can't keep any tanks
anywhere near the front they just blow
up because those you know darn drones or
whatever it is the ukrainians are using
so there are a number of things
that could be the tipping point uh
ukraine running out of shoulder mounted
missiles
if ukraine runs out of shoulder mounted
missiles
or they run out of drones
it's probably over
and i and i gotta think that they're
always close to that point
of not having enough of them or running
out
so here's another one that i had not
considered apparently russia is still
selling plenty of fuel
albeit at a great discount but even at a
great discount they're still making a
lot of money
so russia's economy is doing uh
surprisingly well but there's a new
wrinkle they
in order for russia to trade their oil
to sell it
they need uh go in between people you
know the brokers basically who are the
middlemen
middle people
the middle they
who make sure that the russian oil finds
the right market and they also handle
the sketchy stuff
so there's some brokers in this market
who's kind of specialize on the
dangerous countries and the dangerous
providers
but even they have decided to back out
even before sanctions would have caused
them to do it anyway
so now they're not going to have middle
people to sell their oil
now as was pointed out to me uh gregory
markles on
uh on twitter
that as long as russia has uh oil
and there are tankers
and there are countries who want that
oil
probably
you don't need that middlemen as much as
maybe you thought you did
but i ask you this
how much would the lack of
these traders or middle people
have to degrade the
the russian oil trade before there was a
tipping point
because remember nobody thinks that the
oil that russia's oil exports will go to
zero
nobody thinks that but suppose it went
down 10 percent
well i think that they could probably
hold on right
suppose it went down
20
could russia stay in business and still
fund their military and and be
you know solvent
if um
if their oil export went down 20
i don't know
there's somewhere there's a tipping
point
is it 40
my
my just economic let's say
general
knowledge says that if their exports
went down 40
just because the efficiency of these
traders was lost
because that could make a big difference
they may be doing things like
guaranteeing that contracts get
fulfilled and that sort of thing if you
take out those guarantees
it's just like a it's a free-for-all
so i don't know does the process even
work
at all
when you take out the people who are
guaranteeing both sides of the
transaction i'm guessing i'm guessing
that they have it gives you some
assurance that the transaction can
happen to have these middle people
so
um
this one might be one to watch
might be one to watch
so i do think there's a tipping point
what do you think about the fact that
the us by giving
33 billion dollars in need or whatever
it is to
ukraine
that's the current
move by the administration
how does how does putin not take that as
war and
and how has it not been war up to now
it's we're in this weird pretend
situation where we pretend the us and
russia are not already or
in a practical way
yeah proxy war
to me it's just mind-boggling that we
can keep up that pretense
we might as well just say we're at war
but we don't want to go nuclear so we're
just going to push each other and see
who see you can push the farthest push
the most without going nuclear
so none of that's good
but
is it weird that we're not more worried
about a nuclear war
or is it that we still think that uh
putin is rational
even if he's made some bad decisions
he's still rational
and there's no way that would be
rational to go nuclear
i can't imagine because he has a path
now to survive but if he goes nuclear i
can't imagine he would
have a path to survive
all right that ladies and gentlemen
is a conclusion of my poorly prepared
remarks
i think you would agree
this has been a highlight of your day
a highlight of
possibly human
endeavors since the beginning of time
i don't want to go on the limb it might
be hyperbole it might not be i don't
know might not be
but
if you think
that this is the best experience you've
ever had and you're on youtube hit that
subscribe button
because
i never tell you to do that all right i
will i will tell you a joke i wasn't
going to do this but i saw them in the
comments
uh amber turd
um
given that she was complaining about
johnny depp
uh is part of the meepoo movement
yes the meepoo movement
i did not make that one up i read it in
the comments
and um i hope that we'll be done
with these
with these bad jokes
one of your best i think this was one of
my best live streams thank you for
noticing i was going to tell you if you
didn't know
and i'm going to give you uh one
hypnotic suggestion before you leave
are you ready
now now you have to you have to do this
willingly
because it doesn't work unless you you
like the suggestion
in other words it has to be compatible
with something you wanted anyway
you ready
you're gonna have a really good weekend
there you go
and uh
let me know how it was
i'll talk to you tomorrow well
you can let me know on monday but i'll
talk to you tomorrow anyway
