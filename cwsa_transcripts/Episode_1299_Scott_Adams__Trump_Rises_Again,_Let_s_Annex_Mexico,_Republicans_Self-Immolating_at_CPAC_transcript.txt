hey everybody
come on in come on in
it's the first time i've talked this
morning i think i like it
this is going to be one of the best yeah
it really is
you think i'm exaggerating no one of the
best
coffees with scott adams of the entire
day
and if you want to enjoy it to his
maximum potential
and why would you settle for anything
less really all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker jealous
or steiner canteen jugger flask of
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes absolutely everything better
it's called the simultaneous set button
watch it happen
right now with your help go
ah well i promised all of you
that i would read the book 1984 which
i'd never read before
but one feels as though you get the idea
you don't really feel like you have to
read that book because you know so much
about
the idea but so many people said scott
scott
you have to read it i know you think
that it's not going to help
but you have to read it trust me so i
got a copy of it and i started reading
it
i haven't gotten very far but let me
tell you
uh before i give you a you know a view
of the larger
book oh my god he can write well
so the part i didn't see coming is just
that he's just such a good writer
i didn't know that that was going to be
so striking but
my god he's just good at writing
so i'm only you know this much into the
book i'll tell you if it changes my mind
anything
what i'm expecting is it's just going to
be a fun
sci-fi read and it'll be stuff that i
generally had been thinking before
the fact that it was prophetic does that
mean anything
i don't know if that means anything but
yes he was probably prophetic
i think we should all make a decision as
a
as a nation that we should just
judge each other by the worst
people who say they're part of our group
so whatever your group is your group
could be
your ethnicity your religion could be
your political affiliation
it doesn't matter what it is but
i think instead of pretending we're
judging each
other individually when we're not it's
sort of obvious we're not
why can't we just be more open about it
and just say you know i'm going to judge
you
by by the quality of strangers
you've never met who voluntarily joined
whatever group you're in
or are just in it because of their
ethnicity
we should just not pretend that we're
judging in
people individually because we're not we
stopped doing that a while ago
we do judge people by the worst people
who voluntarily decided that they're
part of your group
you know you you woke up in the morning
you thought hey i'm just a good democrat
and then a democrat goes on a
murder spree you're like well i guess
i guess i'm just like that just accept
it
just accept it those of you who are
coming in late and saying where is the
simultaneous sip
that's what you get for being late i
mean
it's the same time every day do you have
any excuse for missing
the simultaneous said no no you don't
there's no excuse timeliness it's next
to godliness
all right um you know what i always say
about
accusations of sexual harassment
it's the second one to get you the first
accusation
for some famous person let's say
governor cuomo just to pick a random
example
if you have one accuser and you've had a
long
history of public life and being in
charge
etc and only one accuser
people say to themselves what are the
odds that this person who's accused of
this behavior
only did it once or only one person came
forward
after all these years it's always that
second one to get you
and it looks like uh governor cuomo uh
has a second one
now will it end with the second one
what are the odds there are only two
now i have to say that if you were going
to rank
the badness of what he did you know on
the on the one to
ten scale where ten is like you know a
violent
sex crime you know whatever whatever ten
is pedophilia
whatever you wanna put at ten um
cuomo is down sort of in that you know
mid-range where
people get fired for that behavior
probably should
but you know he's not killing anybody
so watching this all uh come about
and and again based on my statement
somebody will take that out of context
and say
why are you minimizing it comparing it
to murder isn't really
minimizing is it wouldn't that just be
an accurate statement of
you know where it lives on the scale of
badness but still bad enough to get
fired in today's world
uh but will cuomo be fired or will the
will the democrats gather around him now
the bigger story what we're saying is
do you think this is about cuomo no
do you think it's about the victims or
the alleged victims
no no it's not
uh it's about 2024. so when you see the
people who are the presumptive
you know maybe frontrunners for 2024
you're watching one by one they're all
being taken down and assassinated by the
the opposite press so you're seeing
cuomo being taken down
by uh by anybody who doesn't want to see
him
as president because he had such a
strong base there from the coronavirus
for a while
that'll look like wow he would just have
to he'd just have to want to be
president
and he just walk right into the job but
the media has taken him down
with the help of the accusers and of
course
uh probably the longest string of
gigantic mistakes
we've seen from any politician in a long
time
think about what you thought of cuomo in
the early days of the pandemic
because i was one of the people who
praised him
and you know i was trying to be
independent of party affiliation and
just say
hey he's doing a pretty good job in
these public
hearings about coronavirus but it turns
out that might have been the only thing
he was doing a good job at
when he wasn't allegedly sexually
harassing people
and uh sending people to their death
in nursing homes because of the
coronavirus and then
apparently covering it up allegedly so
he's had the worst
probably the worst year of any
politician
of any time and
he's still in office could do you think
a
do you think a republican would have
lasted this long
i don't know i don't know so we'll see
but when you see josh hawley getting
targeted to be taken down
that's because he has 2024 potential etc
but um as of today and based on what
we're seeing in the polls and what we're
seeing from cpac
and what mitch mcconnell is saying about
trump etc
it doesn't look like the the republican
side has any mystery left
the the reporting is that trump is going
to walk right up to the line
but not cross it at his speech today of
looking like he's running for 2024.
now i don't think he'd do it unless he
meant it i don't i
i think he's way beyond bluffing you
know i don't think it's a bluff
so if if you see that trump act serious
about running in 2024 i would take it
seriously
and apparently the republican party has
decided that if he does run
that's it right i mean they'll probably
be a primary challenge
but it looks like he could just walk
into the job
so so um
first of all i'm happy that he's in the
news again so i have something to talk
about
that really that really helps um
but it does make all of the republican
potential challengers irrelevant now
so when we're talking about rand paul
and josh hawley
and matt gates and anybody else running
for president
none of that matters as long as trump is
in the mix
none of them have a chance of getting
nominated but
would trump have a chance of winning
well what is what is the prediction i
remind you of
every single day my prediction i remind
you of
every day is that the longer trump is
out of office
the better he'll look the better he will
look
and the reason is that biden will have
to address
one by one each of the same things that
trump was criticized for
and he's going to have to do better
or he'll or you know presumably
democrats would lose the white house
now has he now my my take on this has
always been that
trump had actually done as well as you
can do
on a lot of things that he was
criticized for and
while we would all like a lot of things
to be better everything from health care
to
children in cages you know who's in
favor of children in cages
nobody right so we we looked at those
problems and say
their problems because they're hard to
solve
so if biden walks in and he solves them
i think he or the democrats should get
reelected wouldn't you
wouldn't you say if if biden came in and
then just solved a bunch of problems
that trump
couldn't solve then i think the
democrats have a really good argument
for the white house again
but if biden walks in and runs into a
wall
so to speak and he can't solve any of
the problems that trump
also struggled with such as immigration
is sort of a
not something you solve or don't solve
it's something you're
sort of working on forever but
yeah they're now that they're overflow
facilities somebody says
they're not kids in cages anymore so
problem solved
so i would say that biden is a real
liability
for keeping the white house unless he
actually solves
some problems that that trump couldn't
and
everything we're seeing is him making it
worse
it looks like biden's making it worse on
the border
so far we'll have to see how it develops
but at the moment
the smart money says he's making it
worse looks like he's making it worse
on jobs you know with the pipeline etc
so there's a whole bunch of places that
it does look like
biden is just opening up the door to the
white house for the republicans
and for trump to come back in
all right here's a
thing that i would have called maybe
not suspicious before you know if you
if you're a trusting person you have to
get screwed a number of times before you
stop being trusting
and with social media shadow banning and
that sort of thing i don't think we can
trust
that if if there are two explanations
for a thing
with social media i don't think you can
trust the
the one that's innocent usually i tell
you to trust the innocent explanation
because it's usually right
but i don't know that we're in that
world now and here's the the specific
question
so i was watching my youtube traffic for
doing what i'm doing now it's on both
youtube and periscope
at the moment but the youtube traffic
you know they have really good stats you
can tr
you can track things at about the time
in 2020
when the trump administration was making
the most noise
about some kind of
regulation for the social media
platforms and noise about suppression of
conservative voices
something happened to my traffic you're
right in the in
the beginning of the summer of last year
and it just went crazy
so that's when the trump administration
was threatening the social media
platforms
my twitter feed my my uh
my youtube traffic just went through the
roof
now as soon as biden won
um my traffic fell off like a lot
a lot now is it just because
it's not the election season now
if you would ask me you know i don't
know two years ago why did things get
quieter
after trump lost the election
i would have said well obviously there's
just more and there's just less energy
out there
people who are watching me came to see
what i said about trump he's not there
it's obvious
it's obvious why the traffic went up
before the election
obvious and it's obvious why it went
down after the election
but i don't know if we can make that
assumption anymore
because i think the social media
platforms
lack the transparency which would allow
you to say that the obvious answer is
the obvious answer that it's just you
know
a normal pattern because of the election
it doesn't feel like that
it feels like maybe it was the trump
administration
pressure that changed the controls
and as soon as biden's back in office
the controls went back on
that's what it feels like all right now
can i say that the evidence demonstrates
that clearly
no no because the other alternative that
it's just a natural
you know because of the election cycle
and there's nothing else to explain
is explains it perfectly
but while you have these two
explanations and non-transparency it's
sort of like the election problem right
as long as you have uh any limits on
transparency
we're way beyond the world in which you
can assume good intentions
um i i think it's a good trend that
women are getting more involved in mass
violence
uh you know that a number of women were
injured and
and were a vital part of the uh assault
on the capitol
i think 26 women have been identified as
you know people of interest by the by
law enforcement
and where two two women died maybe
at least one but i noted also the antifa
and black lives matter protests also
have lots of women in them
and those can get a little violent too i
don't know how much of the women doing
the violence how much the men we did see
we did see women and antifa you know
breaking windows and stuff
so we know that they do some stuff
setting fires
so um i feel as though
the violence this this mass violence
like the capital
assault and the riots during the summer
they've all taken on this sort of
lifestyle feel
because let me tell you this and i'm
trying to say this
i'm trying to say this in the
least sexist way
if you're really trying to take over a
country
you leave the women home sorry
sorry if the capital assault had been an
actual military takeover
the women don't go right
uh and there's no reason they can't
of course women can carry weapons women
are in the military there's
there's no reason they can't be there
it's not it's not logically
or practically you know
undoable certainly doable but
i feel as if when it's when you're
serious about it
the women don't go they can
right and they would be capable in many
cases
but i feel like that's a big tell that
there's some
there's something more lifestyle about
this and less
killy about it you know what you know
what i'm saying
because as a culture there are some
things that are somewhat predictable
even if you don't like them and one is
that
when the serious killing starts the men
push the women away
right if the men were there to do
serious killing
they would have prevented the women from
attending they would have just kept
saying you can't go beyond this point
because after this point there's going
to be some serious killing
you you stay there so i don't think i
think that's yet
another obvious signal that the at least
the bulk of the people who were at the
capitol
were not planning it to be violent
because they would have
pushed the women out of the building
they would have physically removed the
women
if they were planning to be that violent
now that's not an absolute right you
can't say that for sure
but every time you see one of these
indications of what people are thinking
it's worth throwing it on the mix but it
might be apophenia
that ability that phenomenon where we
see patterns where there are no patterns
all right david
boxenhorn on twitter made a comment that
i love for its uh
optimism he said this on twitter he said
for decades the world benefited from
technologies
spun off from world war ii then the cold
war
will a new family of mrna vaccines
wipe out the last remaining serious
infectious diseases
and give us early protection from the
next pandemic
on betting yes now the specific examples
in an article that
david boxenhorn tweeted
was about how they're looking at the
same technology the the base technology
for the mrna stuff
and by the way i've heard this called a
a platform or a technology
and i don't know enough about it but
that it's interesting that they see it
as a
a platform meaning that you could do a
lot of things on top of the platform and
one of them might be malaria
so there's real good indication that you
could use the same technology
not the same not the same uh vaccination
but it's the same technology
to take care of malaria malaria is like
a big deal
if you're in the wrong part of the world
and
and maybe even as david box and horn
notes
maybe even targeted cancers so there
might be
a cancer solution here a malaria
solution
and a pandemic solution that come out of
this pandemic
and i think that this is more likely yes
than now
so i'm going to agree with david here
that
i feel as if there are massive just
massive social and technological
benefits coming out of the pandemic
you know everything from changing how we
do everything right commute buy things
shop
we do our food i'm just everything but
this is one of the big ones
here's another good twitter comment from
christopher hill
uh another person you should follow
david box and horn you should follow him
and christopher hill and he says
and i never thought about this this is a
good point you said lockdowns largely
rob us
of our everyday experiences with the
other group
meaning you know people on the left and
people on the right politically
at least i mean it means every other
kind of group as well
how many leftists were kept in check
because a conservative would stop and
fix their standard their stranded car
took one year to go full nazi
like things move fast right um
now this example of course is just you
know
uh it's not like this affected every
person on the left
so i wouldn't call it be leftist being
kept in check
but i think the point is a good one
if you commuted to work or you had your
normal
social life you would have had probably
a lot more accidental contact with
people in different political
persuasions
and many of those contacts would have
gone well
in other words you know it isn't
somebody necessarily
stopping to change your tire for you but
it might just be people being nice
people
and you say to yourself huh that
republican there
disagree with them totally but i got to
say nice person
you know in person very nice and
likewise the republicans said you know
this uh blue-haired transgender person
i had i had some you know feelings about
first but
when you get to know him great great
person
so how often do we see counter examples
of what the other side is in all their
differentness and their weirdness
and and have it counteracted by our
personal experience
hey my personal experiences these people
are great
people are people but as soon as you're
living in that twitter world and you're
socially isolating with your family
maybe all you get is one set of
experiences for
a year what's that do to you i mean it's
a good point
it's sort of a an unknown is this a big
deal
it could be it could be a big deal we
won't know maybe
ever i ask you this question
about border with mexico so the biden
administration is going soft
i think it's fair to say soft would be
not even really an opinion it seems like
that matches the
the news going soft on
immigration enforcement or a lot softer
so a lot of the a lot of the folks who
would have been eligible
or targeted for deportation under trump
are no longer targeted
so they have to be pretty serious
criminals to get
uh deported now
but beyond that uh there may be more of
an open imitation
open invitation to come on over because
you know you won't be put
put in cages maybe we'll see oh
or uh you might be able to stay and you
know just not show up for your court
case and that's fine
so under under biden we do assume that
there will be
an increase in immigration of some kind
we're waiting to see what that looks
like
but here's my question shouldn't we at
least be
talking about annexing
mexico making it some some kind of a
affiliated organization i'm not sure
americans would want to increase their
taxes to you know take care of the
social programs in mexico
but i feel like we could have some kind
of annexation
now you say to yourself oh wait a minute
that's uh that's about as illegal as
anything could be
to which i say that would be true if
mexico were
like a regular government but mexico is
effectively a narco government it's it's
a criminal organization
for all practical purposes because the
the elected government can't do anything
without the
without the narco um drug
cartels approving otherwise they
would get killed so given that it's a
criminal organization
and uh biden just opened the doors
said hey come on in with your criminal
organizations
how do we control the badness coming in
unless you can either have some direct
control over mexico
by annexing it or you close the border
aren't those your only two choices so
trump was going for the
you know leave mexico alone close the
border
and you know just have a controlled
situation
biden is more porous border not closing
it
or not opening it but it's porous by
design
we should at least throw it in the mix
now if we throw it in the mix and people
and smart people say
well that's not practical there's no way
to do it okay
but i feel like it has to be in the mix
if you're opening the border
if you're going to be tight on border
then no you don't need to talk about it
all
but i don't see how an open-ish open-ish
border can possibly work unless we can
control what's happening on the other
side
so it has to be in the conversation i'm
i'm starting
i'm stopping well short of saying we
should annex
mexico i'm not saying that i feel like
you should be in the conversation
as an integrated strategy because
because just
having a porous border is a half
strategy it just
sort of makes the united states evolve
into sort of a
mexico-ish more situation
if that's what you want at least do it
intentionally if you're not doing that
intentionally
let's talk about what we could do
intentionally um
have you noticed that there are two
situations when you have a disagreement
with somebody
number one they're they're hallucinating
a world that doesn't exist because they
don't have enough
information so people who are low on
information
literally hallucinate a world that
doesn't exist
because their lack of information causes
them to piece together this view of
reality that's
artificial doesn't isn't real so what if
you
if you approach this person who is under
informed
and you give them information and it's
good it's accurate
does that person take that information
and say oh
wow you filled in a whole bunch of holes
for me didn't know about that
so now i'm going to alter my world view
with this new information
no no you you can observe that that
doesn't happen
the person will be triggered into
cognitive dissonance
and cognitive dissonance is just another
kind of hallucination
so it's just a different hallucination
the first hallucination is
is triggered by lack of knowledge the
second hallucination
is triggered by accurate knowledge
it just doesn't match what they thought
they thought before
there are only two situations not having
enough knowledge
and then having enough knowledge
both of them cause you to hallucinate
now i've been telling you since the
beginning i have this background in
hypnosis and hypnotists are taught
among other things that everything is a
hallucination in other words everything
is a subjective interpretation
of something there might be some base
reality but it's not available to us
you know we don't know what it is i mean
we can we can get
clues to the process of science you know
over time
but our day-to-day you know what's the
world who am i
what's going to happen today what are
the forces that are operating
it's all illusions you only have two
ways to get to those illusions
but there are only two paths and they
both lead to illusion
so uh once it's one thing to
intellectually know this is true
intellectually you can say yeah i see
what you're saying scott yeah
you know we're not that accurate with
our our world view
but there's this whole path going from
yeah i know it
intellectually to actually seeing it
meaning that you're walking down the
street and you don't think any of it's
real
i mean that's that's a whole different
level
of understanding your world as
subjective
now you have to treat it as real because
if the truck is coming you don't want to
work
walk in front of it but uh there's a lot
of interpretation going on here is what
i'm saying
all right and the best place you can see
this
if you haven't tried it yourself i was
doing this yesterday with a
somebody on twitter i consider a very
rational person
so you start to know people on twitter
that you don't know personally
if you watch anybody's responses and
there's one individual and i won't name
him
but he's really good at responses
and i see him responding to lots of
different tweets in my feed
and he does a good job and he often
disagrees with me or the people he's
responding to
but he does it really well so
it's not a name that you've heard before
all right so i'm talking about somebody
whose name i've never mentioned
so if you think you can guess who it is
don't it's just somebody
you probably haven't experienced and i
was watching him
uh doubt the find people hoax
and then somebody showed him the full
transcript and pointed to where in the
transcript
you can see trump says without prompting
that the racist should be condemned now
the transcript is 100 percent clear
information
that trump always talked about his
assumption that there were non-racist
there and they were the fine people the
people who were the racists were the not
fine people
clear as could be so what happens when a
completely rational person
is introduced with this new knowledge
they go down the well
i call it the cognitive dissonance well
and watching it happen in real time
you have to try it you need to try it at
home
the first thing they'll do is deny that
there were any fine people there and
then i usually add
i interviewed them and they denounced
the races
and they uh just liked the statues and
then
a little further down the well the
person will say but they couldn't have
been
fine people because they were marching
with racists
who marches with racists now that's the
first hallucination
there's no evidence that everybody was
marching
that's just nobody's ever reported that
it's never been asserted it's a complete
hallucination that all the people there
were marching
in fact there were just different groups
some were marching
the police actually wouldn't let people
who got there
after a certain point even get anywhere
near the marchers
so they were physically separated so
that's the first hallucination you get
that every time
and then it goes down to yes but if you
support statues
then by definition you must be a racist
and they must have been lying to you
scott when you interviewed them
personally
to which i say something like 20
of african americans support keeping the
statues
are we done here i don't know why they
support them
i haven't asked them but it's fairly
consistent right
over 20 percent of black citizens
who should be in my opinion a little bit
offended by that
at least a little bit if not a lot and
i'm anti-statute by the way because i
think they're impolite
and that to me that's the end of the
conversation
why would you do impolite things in
public right
i mean it's legal but that doesn't mean
it's a good idea
so for me the entire statute of
conversation comes down to
is that polite to put something up there
that
so many so many citizens of this country
are offended by
i mean you can do it and i get that it
has a historical
you know meaning and free speech is
important yada yada
but it's kind of impolite and if you
need to argue beyond that
you know all the way to history and
stuff like that those are all
true statements i wouldn't even give you
any pushback on that
no pushback at all i'm just saying why
would you choose impolite
like how does that make anything better
well
you don't even need to get political
about this even a little bit
i don't see any politics to it
it's just it's rude it's just impolite
now it wasn't always rude right things
change but i think you have to allow
that people's sensibilities change over
time
all right um speaking of cpac
uh malcolm flex also on twitter made
this comment
he said that talking about cpac he says
making masking a hill to die on is a
self-replicating
l meaning loss for conservatives
many conservatives don't have any
political capital or willpower to
enforce
not masking could have just hammered on
fouchy's inconsistencies and double
masking idiocy
good analysis by malcolm flex
i assume that's just his twitter name um
i would agree with this it is one thing
to say
that you you as a let's say republican
is one thing to say that you're
anti-mask and you think other people
should be etc
but it's not something you're going to
win right
so pushing against something you're not
really going to win
you have to you have to ask yourself if
that's worth doing but more importantly
it's just this giant red flag that says
don't vote for me in 2024.
you know the cpac is part not partly
it's
it's primarily about the base right but
it's widely reported
so whatever they do this sends a
political message about who
republicans are is going to come out of
cpec
and the message the republicans sent is
that their anti-mask
now of course republicans vote for
republicans
but you need just a few people on the
other team to vote for you if you want
to be president
you got to get a few how many how many
democrats are republicans going to get
to vote for them by being anti-mask
none it's two democrats
it looks anti-science so
it's one thing to fire up your base with
your anti-mass stuff
but it's such a bad look if you're
trying to
attract any votes from the other side
so i'd say politically it's a disaster
and i would agree with
malcolm flex's take but
in terms of your personal opinion it's
fine
yeah now i know you want to argue with
me about the science
the science and the freedom of the mass
i'm not talking about any of that those
are all separate conversations i'm
talking about
only the politics all right the way you
look
and the way you present yourself matters
right if you want your person to be in
charge you need them to
put a gut put on a good show the show is
part of politics
right the the forum is in many ways more
important than the function
that's how politics works so i think
it's terrible politics
no matter what you think about the
science or the freedom of it those are
just separate conversations
um on cnn there's a
ques no msnbc there was a
opinion piece saying why did the capital
let's say the capital law enforcement
people why did they prepare extensively
for the black lives matter protests
about
george floyd but they did not prepare
extensively for the capital
assault by the trump supporters and the
implication not implication the direct
accusation is that it was
racism do you buy that do you think it
was racism because i guess in both cases
they did not have uh you know
valid intel to say that either one of
them would cause
violence you know excess violence that
would require a
massive presence there's always a little
so
if neither the blm protests for george
floyd
nor the capital protests
were meant or at least predicted to
become
big violent events always a little bit
of violence
if they weren't predicted but one of
them you prepared for and one you didn't
isn't that racism did you only think
that the blm
protests would get violent because there
would be a lot of black people there
that's a good that's a fair question
isn't it
is that a fair question no
no that's not a fair question because
there was enough history with black
lives matter
slash antifa protest
to assume that things could get out of
control at least looting wise
what was the track record of
trump-related
gatherings zero violence
or whatever is trivial right so if you
were making your assumption based on
track record
you would prepare differently for those
two things wouldn't you
i would i wouldn't have called it racist
do you think if there of course there
are not if
but do you think that the black law
enforcement people
who you you should assume would be less
racist against black people
is that a fair assumption that the black
law enforcement people
probably agreed with this same standard
that they hadn't seen trump supporters
get violent before
they'd seen black lives matter and
antifa
sort of combined protests definitely get
out of control
why wouldn't you incorporate that in
your planning i don't i don't understand
why that would not be an
obvious thing to incorporate past
pattern
seems obvious
senator chris murphy tweeted and you
gotta see
the comments on this tweet it's it's on
my feed
he tweeted i'm a progressive democrat
but i'm friends with republicans
i frequent businesses owned by
republicans i roof for sports teams full
of republicans
i've devoted my life to politics but i'm
careful to not let my politics
consume me i appreciate this that's a
good statement
that's a good statement of how to keep
your politics and your personal life
separate and be good to everybody and it
calls for unity
man you should expect that the comments
wouldn't the comments on that be pretty
good huh huh
i mean you'd expect people in the
comments especially the democrats to say
yeah
yeah let's have some unity let's work
together
but no instead democrats flooded into
this democrat's tweet
to tell them that this is different and
you cannot befriend republicans
because it would be i'm putting my own
spin on this but
effectively they're saying this is
different republicans are nazis
and you don't make friends with nazis
that's the world we live in and i got to
tell you if you don't read the comments
yourself you won't even believe that
there are people out there who believe
that
now what got us here
what caused this situation this is
clearly the fake news
the fake news plus social media you know
extending it this is a fake news problem
a hundred percent a fake news problem
and we're letting
them do that to this country the fake
news is just
ripping the country apart we just let it
happen
because you know fourth estate yeah very
valuable
got to have that you know that news
business
but we lost our news business we don't
have a really good news business
not in the way we used to if we ever did
i don't know
so let's score one for fake news
destroying the country there's a
study of a drug called fluvoxamine
which is used to treat stuff like ocd
and social anxiety and depression and
apparently
in trials it lowered the number of
people who die
of covet so it's a completely unrelated
use
because it's not used it's not meant for
anything like covet
but because it uh helps regulate the
body's
inflammatory response
it it took the death rate
to zero zero
in a small trial right now you could
certainly
complain about the statistical power of
what they did
but it was big enough that you'd
certainly expect
at least one person to die at least one
because in the control group several did
and that's exactly what you'd expect
now could it be that six people dying in
the control group and
zero in the other group maybe that's a
little
underpowered statistically i don't know
i i mean i don't know enough about this
trial or statistics to say that
but it feels like six and zero
probably is meaningful right so
who knows we might have an existing drug
which means
that it would be easier to get it into
the system get it through you wouldn't
need to get it through fda necessarily
because it's already approved
that could lower the death rate to
zero maybe
so it's called uh what's it called uh
fluvo fluvoxamine
fluvoxamine um
so the george floyd trial speaking of
george floyd is coming i don't know when
but there's a report that minneapolis
the city is paying social
influencers as uh
jonathan turley said in a tweet to
spread an approved narrative
during the floyd trial and there's quite
a bit of money in it so they're actually
paying people who are not part of the
government
to send the approved narrative
to the world now i have two two thoughts
in this number one
as a communication strategy it's pretty
good because apparently
if you can get to say some big twitter
accounts
they can spread the news more
efficiently than say the news could
because not everybody watches the news
but if you get the right social
influencers
they can get all these nooks and
crannies of people who are not following
mainstream stuff so as a as a
communication strategy i like it
but can you see any reason
that the government would need to
control
control the news on this story now
one must always be careful that you are
not the one who is experiencing
cognitive dissonance and or confirmation
bias
the reason those things exist and are
widespread
is that if it's happening to you you're
the only one who can't tell
other people might be able to tell that
you're hallucinating but when it happens
to you
by definition they are your own
hallucinations so you can't tell
you think it's real what is your take on
the george floyd thing
and what's going to happen at the trial
i don't know if i'm so if i'm suffering
from confirmation bias and cognitive
dissonance
on this story but i've seen all the
video
i've seen all the reporting and my
opinion is
and i could be in cognitive dissonance
and i could be experiencing confirmation
bias
very possible very possible right don't
rule that out
but my strong impression which could be
totally wrong is that there isn't any
chance that the
the cop involved the main cop who is
kneeling on the neck will get convicted
of anything murder-ish
do you think so did you see anything
that would suggest he would be convicted
of murder
that wasn't obviously fake news right
because we know that he had enough
fentanyl in him
to make that at least a likely cause of
death
if you're on the jury and somebody tells
you
well yes he did have drugs in him that
probably were going to kill him any
minute
but really it was the knee on the neck
that killed him
what kind of vote do you do do you vote
that guy guilty
if there are two causes of death one you
know would kill him for sure
and the other one it's hard to imagine
it could kill him but
sort of looked like it on the video but
it's hard to imagine how it would
but one of them definitely would kill
him how in the world
do you get 12 people on a jury to
convict that guy
now he may be guilty of you know any
number of lesser
police procedure violations i wouldn't
be surprised
if everything he did was a violation of
police procedure
i wouldn't know you know would you
um but murder i don't think there's any
chance
so what we're seeing here is that the
state
in this case the minneapolis
it probably knows
that that something illegitimate
is happening and they need to manage how
we think about it
interesting isn't it yeah it looks like
he was overcharged
and that's gonna cause a problem
um
saw a lot of uh talk people were asking
me about christy gnome
governor gnome and that she was a star
at the cpac and
maybe she'll run for president but i
will reiterate as long as trump
looks like he's going to run and he does
it doesn't matter what any of the other
republicans
are doing or saying but i'll give you my
take on christy gnome as a
let's say as a star power republican
i can see it i can see it she definitely
has that
x factor thing that makes people you
know want to pay attention
if we pretend her her physicality has
nothing to do with it
we're just being stupid because
obviously it does
you know if i say anything on this topic
somebody in the comments will say
scott's in love with
christy gnome and then i have to block
you because you're just in high school
and i'd like
adults to be here but you can't ignore
it as
it's just an obvious factor you know
people's
physicality just matters it matters
you know she has probably the most
well-developed arms i've ever seen on a
human being
it matters it matters right
but she's a little low energy
that's that's what i got from her speech
a little
her wattage is a little lower
than maybe it would take to get elected
now maybe she can
raise that wattage with some practice
and effort i don't know
but i would say maybe not quite the
energy
needed but she'd be a strong candidate i
mean certainly she'd have
if trump were not in the race
she'd be pretty strong because i can't
think of a negative against her
uh except the democrats wouldn't like
her mask policy but i don't know
i think she could survive that because
the state did okay
relatively speaking yeah applause was
high
and uh republicans like her but none of
it's relevant as long as
trump is likely to be in the race
nobody has a chance against him all
right
so governor cuomo apparently is going to
appoint a judge to look at the
allegations sexual
harassment allegations against him but
he picked somebody who's an insider
somebody who has a you know enough of a
connection to cuomo
that nobody in the world would trust the
result if it came out good for him
so the fixes in on that um
and watching cnn have to cover the story
because at this point
even they're covering it is
the story within the story it's better
than the story
uh over in portland direct action the
rioters are still
still rioting and they were
shouting slogans and graffitiing things
like no kids in cages
so and they spray-painted ice
field office so i guess biden did not
stop the uh
protests about the kids in cages but
we'll see if that goes anywhere
um
how in the world does cuomo get to pick
a judge to look into his malfeasance
yeah yeah how in the world um
obviously it looks like an inside job
but we'll we'll find out what happens
and i i will leave you on this following
thought if we had
a real leader in this country
here's something that real leader would
be telling us
hey country here are the statistics
for private schools that stayed open
in the same general area as the public
schools that did not
and here are the virus outcomes for
those private schools and their families
and now you've got something to look at
so when you're deciding to open the
public schools you can
look at the private ones and say how'd
they do and that would be
not a perfect analogy because the
private schools might have more
resources
might have richer kids so you've got a
different infection level etc
but it would tell you something they
would tell you something important
so for example if it told you that the
private schools had lots of infections
well then you should keep your public
schools closed
maybe right depending on the level
but where is the leader just telling us
that statistic
because it's our biggest question isn't
it it affects everything from the
economy
to your mental health to your just
everything
it's the biggest question putting kids
back in school and the biggest
data point would be one we have i would
imagine
or we could get which is private schools
how'd they do and also some public
schools that did remain open or have
you know partially opened how'd they do
wouldn't your leader
if you had one just tell you that
statistic
or tell you what's wrong with it or
maybe we need to collect more or
something there might be some
context that's important but why are we
not being told that
i feel as if i could be a better
president on day one
let me tell you how i would be president
or governor if you imagine me
running california i would do it the
same way
when that when people said to me okay
scott you're running for office
what's your opinion on policy x
and i would say the same thing for every
policy i'll tell you what
when i'm elected i'll have the best uh
proponents of each strategy for each
policy
debate debate in public with me as the
host
i will cut them off and stop them when
they're saying ridiculous things
and i will let you the public watch me
interrogate both sides and come to a
decision
right in front of you and i'll iterate
it so you might even see my
my opinion evolve as i've pushed back
and got more information
so i won't tell you what any of my
policies will be
i'll tell you what my system will be and
you can watch it in real time
you just watch it who would you vote for
i've told you before that i could get
elected president or governor
that's how that's how now you say to me
but scott
what about your personal life and all
all those things you
did or they'll say you did or those
statements you made
on social media 20 years ago or they
they sounded sexist when you said them
because they're out of context of course
that there weren't actually any sexist
remarks but out of context you could
imagine that they were
what about all that won't they take you
down well here's what i would do with
all that i would say just assume it's
all true
just assume that whatever bad thing you
think i did or said
just assume it's all true and if i'm
still not the best candidate
even if you think all that's true don't
vote for me
i'd still get elected because i would
just say
i'm not going to i'm not going to waste
time on that if you want to believe it's
true
go ahead i still have the only system
that makes sense
yeah i'm running against a i'm
running against a
if i've said some bad things on social
media
count that against me but did i mention
i'm running against a
i'm running against a i said some
bad things you think but of course
they're just taken out of context
throw it all in there just say it's all
true
of course it's not true but just say it
is
i'm still the best candidate it's not
even close
it's not close right now you said that's
perot's strategy
but um he didn't implement it right
he he did not say i'm going to argue it
in public
he was more about the data and you know
not being political and stuff and that
was good
as far as it went but he didn't have the
persuasion skills that i do
and if he did he probably would have
been president but running as a third
party doesn't work
if i ran for office i would run as
what what would i run as
let me ask you if i ran for major office
what party would i run as
i just want to say what you think
somebody says independent
wrong so it's definitely not independent
because you wouldn't get elected there
would be no point
all right i'm just looking at your
answers most are saying democrats some
are saying republican
some are saying republican republican
left a bernie
wig party libertarian realist
no i would the only ones that make sense
are democrat and republican
because that's the only way you can get
elected in this country i mean
realistically
uh at least for president so i'd have to
be one of those
which one would i run on just think in
terms of strategy
i would run as a democrat i would run as
a democrat
do you know why
same reason trump ran as a republican to
fix republicans
trump actually fixed he fixed the
republican party
by giving it you know an identity that
could win at least in 2016.
and a set of policies that even though
the other team hated them
they were at least clear clear and
simple leadership
even if you don't like it it was clear
and simple and it was definitely
leadership
definitely leadership even if you didn't
like it
so the democrats don't have that person
they don't have anybody to tell them
they're messed up
because and that's what trump did trump
was as
critical no that's not true but he was
very critical of standard republicans
you know you're not seeing as much of
that they're a little bit the
progressives
you know getting on biden a little bit
but um
if i ran as a republican i would get
only republican votes
would you agree if i ran as a republican
the best i could do is to get only
republican votes
if i ran as a democrat and knowing that
i have said as many good things as i
have about trump's
you know process his system his
persuasion
his way of achieving things don't you
think i could get
some republicans
of course i could absolutely i could get
some republicans
how many independents could i get
most of them i would sweep the
independence
so all i would need to do is run as a
democrat because i genuinely have
democrat
let's say
objectives i have democrat objectives
but i have a republican leaning
approach to how to get there systems
transparency and systems i would tell
you that the election system needs to be
transparent and it isn't
and that would be a top priority to fix
it
now if i looked into it and found out
it's actually quite transparent and fine
the way it is i'll tell you
but i'd look into it right in front of
you
i would look into it right in front of
you i would call the experts in and i
would say
is our election system fair one would
say yes
one would say not so sure and then i'd
ask the one who said yes
what percentage of the entire process of
an election from
from getting a ballot to the final count
what what percentage of that total
process is
transparent now what would they say
10 only the things we audit
90 i have no idea i have no idea how
transparent it is
neither do you i know it's not
transparent to me
but i wonder if experts do know it's
more transparent we just don't know it
so imagine this proposition
i don't care about republicans i don't
care about democrats
i'd run as a democrat i would do every
discussion publicly and i would iterate
them not just once
because you do it once and you end up
with a bunch of questions you've got to
do a second time to get the questions
answered
maybe a third time maybe you do it six
times a year
per topic but it's the only way to do it
and having closed door meetings
where the citizens don't know what i'm
saying to either my staff
or to or to let's say a foreign leader
i'm not sure we need those do we
now you say to yourself what about all
our secrets and secret negotiations and
stuff
i feel maybe you could do that without
the president being in the room
right you know maybe a secretary of
state does that
maybe maybe your generals do that behind
the scenes if there's any
if there's any stuff that that the
public genuinely should not see
and there is maybe the president should
be the one
you know uh actively doing that
in a meeting so
i believe that proposition would make me
president
or governor i would just have to present
it
and say look you if you want to know how
how i approached problems i wrote three
books
just look at my books that doesn't mean
i'm smarter than you
it just means you'll know exactly how i
would approach a problem
i do a b testing lots of lots of
transparency
i would make sure that i challenge
people's positions in public
so you could see it and then i would
make decisions
that gave us the best system
loving the republicans with the best
objective
loving the democrats so the best
objective is that everybody in the
united states has
adequate affordable health care does
anybody disagree with that
i know there's some people who disagree
that the government should be involved
that's a fair statement but does anybody
disagree
with if there if you had a way to do it
that worked for everybody wouldn't you
like to have everybody have high quality
affordable insurance
for health care of course so i would
give the best system that would get you
the closest to it
knowing that there are good ways to do
it and bad ways to do it but i'd take
the system that got you the closest
and i would do it in public right in
front of you
uh am i bored you know i'm bored by the
news
because the news got uninteresting when
trump left but
i have to say can i do a little poll
here with my viewers
um with the with trump mostly off the
stage although today he'll be back at
the stage at cpac
but with trump mostly out of the news
you would agree that the news got
completely boring right right
because he was really the energy that
made everything fun to talk about even
if you didn't like it
so so there's that
but here's the second part and here's
the question i want to ask
so i guess these questions will get
mixed up i won't know which one you're
asking you're answering
don't you also feel more relaxed
because i feel as though some amazing
pressure has been lifted from me
that while if you gave me a choice i
would say yeah i kind of like
the trump energy and if you said who
would i like to be president
biden or trump i would pick trump
but if i'm being honest my
my mental health is way better
is anybody having this experience that
their mental health is better
because that there's amount of
conflict that trump brings just with his
energy
that's just always there it's like this
baseline
baseline tension right
and i'm looking at now your answer is
coming in somebody's saying yes to both
so good i know that the answers now are
to the second question
so some people are saying they're more
scared i i would argue that that's
a fake news effect
if you're if you're more afraid under
biden
uh as in it's like the end of the end of
the republic
sort of thing i don't think there's
anything like that going on
but the most likely outcome of a biden
presidency
is it's kind of like not that different
from the last one
that's the most likely outcome is it's
just not that different in ways that
affect you personally
now there'll be differences lots of
differences
but they won't necessarily make this not
america when he's done with it right
i'm not nearly as worried about the the
big outcomes now remember
democrats were just as afraid of trump
just look at their experience when
you're trying to determine if you're
overreacting
or you're accurately seeing the future
democrats
thought trump would be rounding people
into
prison camps by now all right that's
what they thought
and they were way off why would your
assumption about how bad things are
going to be
under biden be any more crazy
than the democrats were about trump
just ask yourself that question it
doesn't mean you're wrong
i'm not saying that because you're you
are seeing a
number of trends that look like a
decrease in freedom
in a number of ways that looks real
that looks real but i don't think it's
the end of the world
um i also was noting the other day the
number of personalities that i
either interacted with or would read
every day
during 2016 and how many of them are off
of social media now
that list got really big
kind of creeping up on you didn't it
it's like
one person a week sort of disappears and
you hear that story and you say well you
know i hate that
freedom of speech is being suppressed
but that thing they said
was pretty bad and you say to yourself
okay
i don't i don't want to die on this hill
because this one person their specific
case
they did do something kind of bad so i'm
not going to get involved with that one
because i don't want that to be
you know part of my reputation and then
there's another one
and then you say to yourself this is a
lot like that other one
it's a special case again do i want to
get involved in a special case
but you know as you're noting in the
comments
it does seem to be sliding in that
direction
so we should be definitely worried about
freedom of speech
now i would argue that i am an excellent
edge
case i would say
that i'm very careful about
saying what is alleged versus what we
know to be true
so in theory my voice should be safe
freedom of speech etc because i'm not
pushing
um inaccurate information and if
somebody
and if i did accidentally of course i
have it accidentally
so everybody everybody who does what i
do occasionally says something that's
not
true you can't avoid that but
if you correct it then you're just like
the rest of the media
it's only when you keep pressing that
that falsehood that you get in trouble
so if you see me actually removed from
social media
things have definitely gone too far
then things definitely have gone too far
because i don't cross the line
now if everybody who does cross that
line
gets taken off of social media but i
don't
was there a slippery slope
this is the case i've been making
forever if if i get taken off
well when never saying anything that's
uh untrue unless i've added it's an
allegation
which is always fair if i get taken off
then things went too far and i think
you'd all agree that
that would be unambiguous at that point
and and i'm definitely getting
demonetized and
it it seems obvious that twitter is
unfollowing people for me
automatically if i ask in the comments
you'll see dozens and dozens of people
who say they were unfollowed for me
automatically
just in the last few weeks no matter
when you ask it'll be
dozens of people who will say yeah it
just happened
so we know that's happening but if i'm
actually
taken off as opposed to
slowly suppressed on a business which is
what's happening
right now my my entire
monetized value for doing what i'm doing
it's now decreasing to the point where
it will cost me money
to do this it will actually just cost me
money i'll have to pay
to do this i will be demonetized pretty
soon and
you're just watching the graph it's only
a few weeks away where i'll actually be
paying
to have freedom of speech instead of the
model which
if you have enough if you have enough
viewers
and advertising in theory your voice
should get stronger
as people enjoy it and etc
and then somebody says is it worth it
well i don't know if that matters
i don't know if that matters when you
say is it worth it
there are two ways to look at that one
is it worth it to me
and the answer is no no it's not
my personal life my my fortune
my reputation are all much worse
unambiguously and i know that right that
was a conscious decision
nothing snuck up on me nothing happened
that i didn't see coming
right it was all transparent and obvious
so somebody says what's my motivation
well uh
i'll tell you that uh some intelligence
entities have wondered the same thing
because people wonder if i'm being paid
by somebody i'm not
i'm not and my motivation is as simple
as this
it's biological when you are when you
are being
compatible with your biological self
as as the self that got created by
evolution over
hundreds of thousands of years or
millions
um i believe that's when you feel the
best
so i'm going to say that again because
there's some few of you are going to
hear this and it will completely change
your life
this is like a big concept but i'm not
going to spend a lot of time
so only a few of you are going to maybe
catch on to this
when you are when you're true to your
biological self
you feel fulfilled and your life is
better
that means for example for many people
it means having kids
right that doesn't mean everybody would
be fulfilled by kids plenty of you are
not
but that is biologically compatible with
how you evolved and
most people i would say i would say the
majority
would feel that biological compatibility
and even though it's really hard to have
kids it's hard
you still feel more fulfilled and glad
you didn't
and i would say that in general not just
with kids
but whenever you're you're aligned with
your biological
truth your life feels better
right and here's another biological
truth
that you can't avoid
and it's sort of the spider-man truth
with great power comes great
responsibility
biologically you know you you would like
that to be true
philosophically oh if you have great
power
philosophically and intellectually we'd
like you to use it for good
right but it's way beyond that it's
biological
when when you have taken care of your
own needs
which largely i have you
your most biologically activated
uh instinct is to take care of more
people
to broaden your your uh universe of
people you're directly helping
and since i've managed to take care of
myself and largely
people in my circle you know the people
personally close to me
my biological instinct is to take that
to the next level
biologically this is compatible with me
that's why it feels so good
right it actually feels good like i i'm
i'm a fulfilled person if i feel that
you got something out of this
and that it was good for the larger good
so i would like to tell you how i'm
going to rebrand
these live streams so they used to be
sort of a
trump-oriented you know energy fund and
and that was great but while trump is
not in office i'm going to
change my focus to the following
self-improvement meaning i'm going to
build your talent stack
but i'm going to do it through a frame
of talking about world events especially
politics
and that will give you something
meaningful and current that we can be
talking about
but the intention is to build your
talent stack of how to look at this
stuff
and how to connect it and in general how
to make your life
more effective and this is a good
example
so this this advice i'm giving you now
about how to try to find your biological
compatibility to have a fulfilling life
for some of you not most of you but for
some of you
maybe five percent maybe 10 this is
completely life-altering
because it's a filter that if you use it
it's incredible
right and this filter says take care of
yourself first
because we don't want other people to
take care of you then it's ruining their
lives take care of yourself
then expand it you know your family your
your
your business et cetera just expand it
so that's going to be the mode talk
about the headlines but build your
talent stack
in ways you won't even know is happening
all right you won't even know you're
getting smarter
you won't even know you're getting more
effective it's just going to happen
because you're going to you're going to
be exposed to new ideas
and some of them will stick all right
somebody said they had a 15 year old
their 15 year old read my books
let me tell you something if you have a
15 year old
who you can get to read even one of my
books completely
you have a prodigy there
you have something special all right and
i'll bet you know that
right i know you know that because in
the comments
tell me how many of you could get a
teenager to read one of my books
really how many of you could pull that
off
ten percent no not ten percent five
percent
oh wow a couple people saying they they
pulled that off
are you kidding i'm seeing i'm
what uh
okay most people are saying or maybe
half
half are saying no way holy cow
a bunch of you actually pulled that off
i am so impressed with your children if
not your parenting
you know my my instinct is not to give
you credit for good parenting
although that's really good parenting
but
you have to have a kid who's willing to
do that and i'm not sure the parenting
gets you to that point
i think there's something about the kid
if you've got a kid who can
who can absorb this kind of material as
a teenager
if i could buy stock in those kids i
would buy stock
i mean i would literally literally i
would invest
if i had a way to buy a if i could buy
an index
fund if there was some way to legally do
this an
index fund of people who would uh who
are capable
of reading any kind of self-improvement
book whether it's mine or somebody
else's
if they're even capable of doing that as
a teenager
i want to put all my money on them
because if you don't think you can
change your whole life
by studying it up in other words
studying how to be effective
reading self-help books from a variety
of people if you don't think you can
completely change your life
just by reading the guides about how to
do it you're wrong
i was doing this as a kid when i was in
my teens
i was voraciously absorbing
uh success stories of famous people
so wherever i saw a story about uh this
person became
successful i would read every detail and
i'd be looking for the
looking for the commonalities all right
all right compare this success story to
this success story what's in common
okay okay now how about this new one and
i'd always be looking for the pattern
because i believed there was a pattern
and i believed
that if i could find it i could build a
strategy around it
to guarantee that i would be successful
and that
that lifetime of looking for that
pattern became
my book had failed almost everything and
still win big that's where
systems versus goals came from it's
where a b testing came from it's where
learning to
uh get over a failure and shame came
from all of those are based on looking
at the
success stories of other people which is
a lifelong passion of mine too
to do that so
if you've got a 15 year old kid who can
do that
oh my god oh my god
the potential they have because if you
could get every kid
to just read my book and i'm not even
going to say
that mine is like the best book in the
world i think it is actually
for this kind of thing but if you could
get
teenagers to read this kind of book in
school
it would completely life-altering i mean
in gigantic ways
it would be huge it would change
civilization
but we don't do it all right that's all
for now we'll talk to you
later all right youtubers
uh might need you to run just to take on
china yeah you know i think enough
people
are uh are wise to china at this point
that i don't know
that i would be the best choice for that
but i would definitely be hard
on china in a way that
oh my god my son was like that too scott
as a kid good
um what is uh let's here's a good
question
what is trump's tension the same as
friction
well it is a form of friction a friction
in your mind it's not the kind of
friction i usually talk about
but uh trump just um he just raises
everybody's emotions good and bad
it's a knack i mean he has a knack for
raising people's emotions
so that's all i'm talking about just the
raising of emotions
somebody says uh they think i would
really enjoy being a father
uh on some level of course
now i have to tell you that when i
uh got divorced from my first wife i
said to myself
um that i don't belong i don't belong to
that family unit anymore and i
i consciously and explicitly
donated myself to the world meaning that
i decided to turn my my efforts outward
and
try to make the world a better place
explicitly that was a
direct specific promise to myself
that i i was now owned by the world
and that was my new responsibility
whereas my golden age you're
you're right in it you're in it
the the changes that the pandemic are
bringing
will be the triggers for the golden age
it's it's what uh will change our health
care
it will change what we think about
everything
and just almost everything got rethought
and that will lead to
a level of innovation and improvement
and everything from health care to
you name it commuting business how we
work
everything that the golden age is almost
guaranteed
at this point because of the pandemic
this is a time of great clarity that is
an interesting comment
i was going to say something about that
myself there is something about the
pandemic
maybe it's maybe or maybe it's just i
don't know maybe it's trump
but there's something about this time
in which people's illusions are
are evaporating more so than i've ever
seen before
now we still have plenty of illusions
like hoaxes and stuff it's dominating
our
dominates the news there's more hoaxes
than real news
but i feel as though at the same time
there's this weird clarity
that that is forming about a lot of
stuff
uh and i don't know what's gonna win the
the
greater new fake news hoaxes or the
greater clarity
about the fact that we're being
manipulated by the
movers and you know the power people
um i don't talk about bitcoin
just because it's outside of my
expertise level
and there's not much to say about it
that's interesting actually
sometimes it goes up that's that's why
you need to say
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
