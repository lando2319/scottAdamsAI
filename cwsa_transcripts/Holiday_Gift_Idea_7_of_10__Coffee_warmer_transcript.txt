all right here's another gift idea on
the low end it's a Mr Coffee coffee
warmer all it does is get warm and your
coffee sits on it now I find that the
big mugs I use for my uh live stream are
a little bit wider than the heating
place but it still works enough heat
comes up I think it's better if your cup
was small enough to fit on there you can
see it's a little beat up but that's
just because I use it so much yeah you
don't need this brand there's probably a
bunch of them that are in the same
category now I'm not a gour
gouron uh I'm not a foodie so I'm not
super U super picky about the taste of
my coffee I do like it warm though so
this really does make a
difference
