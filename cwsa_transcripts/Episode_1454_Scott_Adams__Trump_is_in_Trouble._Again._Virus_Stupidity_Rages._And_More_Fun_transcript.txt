all right here we are
good morning everybody it's the best
time of the day again
yeah sometimes you think to yourself
well
i don't know if it's going to be the
best time but today totally
and all you need is a copper margarita
glass a tank jealous died a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid not
your second favorite liquid that would
be
insanity and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day may the week
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
yes jostendorff this is the dilbert guy
but don't hold that against me uh you
say conscious is good
but pointing out hypocrisy isn't
pointing out
yeah you can point out somebody asked me
a question about hypocrisy versus
contrast
hypocrisy never convinces anybody
because if you say say to somebody hey
you blamed me for doing x but
you did x last year are they going to
stop blaming you
it's never worked in the history of the
world but contrast works
they're just different things to answer
your question
well uh the new york times is in the
news
twice today both for fake news
now i'm not saying it's fake news
i'll uh let you judge but if you're the
new york times
and you yourself are in the news twice
and both times is for spreading
potentially fake news that's not a good
day
washington post getting a little
pushback too i'll tell you about that
so the new york times had this headline
breaking news i think this was yesterday
the delta variant
is as contagious as chickenpox and may
be spread by vaccinated people as easily
as the unvaccinated
and internal cdc report said
so that's pretty bad new york times
paper of record
telling us this new variant is as
contagious as chickenpox and may spread
just as easily if you're vaccinated
wow pretty bad isn't it
all right here's what uh a spokesperson
for the biden administration whose
spokesperson on the the covet stuff i
guess
ben wakana not from wakanda but wakana
he said vaccinated people do not
transmit the virus at the same rate as
unvaccinated people
and if you fail to include that context
you're doing it wrong
that's right the biden administration
just called out the new york times for
fake news
and really really big fake news this is
the kind of fake news that kills people
let me say that again this is the kind
of fake news that kills people
because it's reporting that whether you
get vaccinated or not
the difference is less than you thought
it would be
because you can still get it and still
transmit it
now it turns out that that's just not
true
the what does seem to be true is that
you could have the same amount of virus
in you in your nose and your mouth
but apparently the rate of actually
transmitting it to other people is not
even close
if you're vaccinated you don't transmit
it but how is that possible
how is it possible that you could be
vaccinated
have the same amount of virus in your
nose and your mouth which is
presumably where it gets out and you
don't
you don't spread it but the person right
next to you who is unvaccinated
with exactly the same amount of virus is
spreading it
how do you explain any of that well i
asked this question on
twitter just moments ago i haven't seen
the answer yet
but i asked this one of the things we
know about people who have coveted
symptoms is that they don't know their
lungs are degrading and so people just
breathe
deeper and harder to compensate for the
fact that their lungs aren't as
efficient
but they don't necessarily know they're
doing it so
here's the question if you're vaccinated
you've got a bunch of virus in you
but it's giving you no symptoms
presumably your breathing would be the
same as normal
but the person right next to you who has
no vaccination
they have the same amount of virus but
presumably
if they're if their lungs are affected
they might be breathing
40 percent harder than you are and not
even know it
because apparently that's a real thing
people don't know they're compensating
so i would think that how hard you
breathe
has some effect i don't know if that's
the whole story or any of the story but
we do need to know why a vaccinated
person wouldn't spread it as much as a
vaccine as
unvaccinated uh retracted study from
india using a vaccine we don't
permit yeah so then
one part of the study was from india
looking at an
indian vaccination that we don't even
allow in the united states
so that doesn't count and that i guess
in in the one cluster and where was it
province town or something zero people
died
which is pretty important right
zero people right that should be the
story
the story should be there was breakout
and nobody died that seems pretty
important
all right so that's the first thing that
the new york times
reported in a way that's misleading i'm
not going to say they get a fact wrong
i'll say that they reported it in in a
way that's so misleading it's basically
fake news
according to the biden administration
now i don't think the biden
administration
calls out the new york times unless they
really mean it
right because it's sort of a friendly
publication so they must they must be
pretty serious about it
well the other news is that there's some
handwritten notes
from the time of the january 6th event
in which
trump allegedly told attorney general
rosen quote according to some
handwritten notes at the time
just say the election was corrupt and
leave the rest to me
so the interpretation is that trump was
trying to get his department of justice
to claim without the benefit of any
evidence
that the election was corrupt and that
quote he would do the rest
sounds pretty bad doesn't it it's right
here in the new york times
sounds pretty bad but as
uh margot cleveland and i think other
people this just uh
somebody i saw on twitter uh have noted
that there's some ambiguity about what
he meant
surprise somebody talking about a
conversation with trump and there's some
ambiguity about what he said or what he
meant
surprise right and what is the ambiguity
the ambiguity is it looks like
what trump was saying was conditional
meaning look into the allegations if you
believe the allegations
are credible then call the election
corrupt
and that's all you need to do now
is that illegal is it illegal for the
president to say
if you find a problem say it publicly
what's the problem with that if you see
a problem say it publicly and then i'll
handle the rest
but the fake news leaves out the
conditional part
because that's a little ambiguous from
the notes was it conditional on them
finding something
or do you think just just ask yourself
how likely this is
do you think it's likely that trump
asked somebody who could clearly talk to
the press
somebody who would write their own
memoir someday somebody who was
connected to
tons of people who would talk do you
think that trump
said to somebody who would clearly leak
it someday
i'd like you to lie about the election
and say it was corrupt
do you think he did that to me that
sounds
insanely unlikely
you know trump got this far not by
telling people
who could talk about it later to do
illegal
i just don't think he does that there's
no history of that
now there might be history of you know
people doing things
sketchily that maybe you know god knows
what what has ever happened
or whoever's done what but is there any
history
of trump telling somebody to do
something illegal
i think no i think no and the in the
imagine
to imagine that a sitting president
would tell somebody who definitely
is going to tell other people to do
something that illegal
or i don't know maybe it's more
unethical than on legal illegal i don't
know what law would
specifically be broken by that but it's
just so
unlikely you you would have to start
with the assumption
that trump is you know reckless and
crazy
and lost his mind for him to to have
said that
so i'm going to say that in all
likelihood that's fake news
and i guess the washington post was part
of that fake news
triad too so uh
or duo
yes and now uh now apparently congress
is going to get trump's tax returns
you want to make a prediction about
what's in trump's
tax returns in the comments
let's see your predictions give me your
predictions for trump's
tax returns and i want to see
uh i'm seeing i'll just read your
predictions nothing nothing
nothing of consequence nothing illegal
nothing nothing nothing um
nope there we go
one of you got it right it's going to be
two movies on one screen
guaranteed it doesn't matter what's
actually in the taxes
i think we all know that that's not
going to make a difference what will
matter
is what the people say is in the taxes
and most of the public won't read the
taxes themselves because they wouldn't
know what they're seeing anyway
so some part of the press will say we
found the smoking gun
of horrible horrible behavior who knows
what that is
but they're going to say they found it
the people on the right
the people who would support trump are
going to say no you didn't we're looking
at the same tax returns there's nothing
there
you know or there's nothing clear there
might be something that's ambiguous
but there's no clear indication of
anything that's a problem
do you want to bet against me does
anybody want to take the
the opposite bet and bet that uh
they will have a clear outcome no
there isn't the slightest chance we'll
have a clear outcome here's how you can
predict this
you can predict it because it's a
complicated subject
that's it if it's complicated you know
the public can't check it themselves
so the press could just say any freaking
thing they want about it and people will
say
well i'm not going to check the tax
returns myself
but the daily beast said there's
something bad in there so
what are you going to do yes
as as james is saying here the
appearance of impropriety
you're going to get all kinds of stories
about what if
but what if this this indication of
revenue
is connected to something bad there's no
evidence of it
but what if what if this is telling us
something bad or
or how about this this raises a red flag
there's no evidence of anything bad but
it raised the flag
there's a flag so i feel like it's going
to be endless
uh options for the the anti-trumpers to
just run stories of
you know generalities and vagueness and
innuendo and accusation so
right if the irs hasn't found a problem
yet
you know an illegal problem and
apparently there's no suggestion that
they have
what are the odds or is the problem
there what are the odds and if there is
a problem it's usually
something that the accounting firm takes
care of
um
what if trump paid little or no taxes
are isn't that baked in
would you want a president who did not
take advantage of the tax laws the way
they're written
not really right would you want a
president who paid millions of
dollars extra in taxes that were not
necessary
if that president had simply followed
the existing laws
of taxes and took the advice of
accountants
so if he paid no taxes it's just going
to look like he knows what he's doing
and he has good accountants
i just don't think that's going to hurt
him i mean they'll make something of it
but it won't
it won't be a difference all right let's
talk about
hospital risk why are we not seeing
evening reporting on how impacted our
hospitals are
and where they're headed why is that
is it because it's hard to gather it
would be hard but not
without you know i think you could check
the top 10
you know hospitals and top 10
metropolitan areas you'd have a pretty
good idea what's going on
so why don't we see that reported
is it because that's no longer a
goal do we not have a worry
about the hospitals because i feel as if
once you have half the country
vaccinated and it's mostly the people
who get the sickest are the vaccinated
ones
do we have any risk is there any risk
going forward
that the coronavirus will crash our
hospitals for more than you know say a
week or something
i feel like there's no risk is there or
so small that
it's just not a national problem
so i don't know the answer that but if
there's anybody who could
put some numbers on that and tell me
where we're headed
because i feel like the public should
know that it's a pretty important thing
just skipping topics here for a moment i
guess iran used a drone to attack
some israeli billionaires uh tanker in
the gulf
and it's in retaliation for something
that israel did militarily against
iranian assets
and i'm thinking to myself they really
pick
just the right targets don't they
because it wasn't
it wasn't an israeli flag ship
but it belonged to an israeli
billionaire
so how much is israel going to retaliate
for something that wasn't really against
israel's country and there were there
weren't any
israeli citizens on the ship probably
that certainly none got killed
so it's just the right amount of
provocation
and iran must be running out of
things they can attack that will not
invite full-scale retaliation
it's like they have to do something
we've got to do something
nothing would make any difference do you
think israel is going to change their
policies
because a tanker got hit with a drone
no so is it just for show or is it just
for internal politics or
i don't know why they're bothering to do
it doesn't seem to be helping
well there's an er doctor alex busco
wrote an
article i think this was in cnn and
he notes that uh you know he works in er
and he says 40 of americans still remain
unvaccinated
but 99.2 percent of um
deaths are among the unvaccinated 99.2
percent
are unvaccinated so
um and apparently people in er
when they're you know close to death's
door
because i've heard this in another story
so this is two anecdotal
reports don't put too much weight on
anecdotal stuff
but i've seen two reports of doctors who
say
that dying patients ask for the vaccine
and they don't understand that the
vaccine is to prevent it
not not to fix it although i think it's
being tested to fix it isn't it
but that seems like it wouldn't work i
don't know just guessing
um so do you think it's true
that there are people who think they can
wait until they're at death's door to
get the vaccine
and that that's why they're waiting is
there anybody out there who says you
know
i don't want to get the vaccination just
in case
but i'll get the vaccination after i'm
sick and then i'll be fine
i doubt it i mean but so this doctor
says
a quote um
basically he was complaining about the
massive ignorance of his own patients
uh he actually used that word ignorance
he goes many of my patients
exhibit stunning levels of ignorance
when it comes to this disease and the
vaccine
if you looked at a chart of
people who say they don't want to get
the vaccine even if it's
proven to be safe what percentage of the
public
um doesn't want to get the vaccine
well if you look at republicans at least
back in december so this is
several months old now but back in
december
42 of republicans said they wouldn't get
the vaccination
even if everything looked good um
rural americans 35 said no black
adults said 35 said no
but among vast other groups
uh white and hispanic adult males etc
it's about 25 percent of the country
so uh if you take out republicans and
uh black adults and rural
about 25 of what's left don't want the
vaccination
now is that the way to measure this
do you think it's fair to try to figure
out how many black people don't want the
vaccination
versus how many republicans versus how
many anything else does that seem fair
that that's the way we're slicing this
because the way you decide to categorize
things is going to
help you with your decision making right
so if you categorize things wrong
maybe you don't make the right decisions
here's how i do it
by education level
yeah think about it suppose instead of
saying how many republicans or
black people got vaccinated or wanted to
you simply reported it by
education level what do you think would
happen
do you think you would find somebody
says that
do iq trouble with iq is that you can't
get to it
you know people don't know their iqs etc
so you can use education level as a
rough proxy for iq
which it is it's a rough proxy so
suppose the only the only reporting
was how informed you are or how educated
you are
suppose let me ask this of those of you
who
decide to get unvaccinated first of all
while i'm doing this
could you tell me in the comments how
many of you watching this have decided
to not get
vaccinated so i just want to see
you know how many people who are
watching this now are in that category
okay so watch watch the comments go by
you'll see quite a few people
who are not getting vaccinated so this
is a question to you
um question to you if you knew
that the most educated and high iq
people
were getting vaccinated would it change
your opinion
if you knew the smartest most informed
people
were getting vaccinated
now most of you are saying no nope nope
nope nope nope
nope nope so why is that can you explain
i know it's hard in the comments because
the comments are short but
could you explain why you would not be
influenced
by all the smartest people getting the
vaccination
i'm not saying you should i'm just
looking i'm just wondering about your
thinking
so i'm not trying to influence you i'm
curious
that's not how we make decisions right
you don't want to look at the smart
people to make your decisions
now can you give me an example in
history
where the the least smart people made
the best decisions
all right um and that's a by the way
that's a serious question i don't even
know the answer to it
usually i ask questions where i kind of
know the answer
but i'm not leaving the witness this
time give me an example
let's say in the united states and the
past
20 years so united states past 20 years
how many decisions
did the smartest people get wrong while
this
well the dumbest people got it right
can you give me some examples somebody
says iraq
i don't know that the data would show
that
would it i don't know about
uh hunter biden selling art i don't know
the war in iraq
i don't know that that's ever been
studied have we ever looked at the
difference between
i uh education level and support for the
war in iraq
i doubt we've seen that um
war on drugs huh
that would be interesting are you saying
that the dumb people
not the dumb people but the are you
saying that this
the most educated people thought the war
on drugs was good
i don't know that the evidence would
suggest that
climate change well climate change is a
tricky one
because it assumes that you know the
right answer
and we don't you know i i think with
climate change you still have to play
the odds
you know it's not it's not a yes no
situation you have to play the odds on
that one
so i don't think you use that one
wokeness
oh that's a pretty good example yeah the
the wokeness would be an example where
the
the high education people think it's a
good idea
and it's obviously not
but i don't know if the i don't know if
research would back that up
anyway uh if rasmussen or somebody wants
to do a poll
to show us if the most educated and
informed
people are getting vaccinated more than
other people would be interested to know
now i'm not saying you should make your
decision based on that
but wouldn't you want to know i'd want
to know
food pyramid and trans fats no that's
just an example of smart people being
wrong
that's not a that's not an example of
all the dumb people knew that
that the pyramid was wrong teachers
unions
and i don't see that point yeah
all right so that that's just my point i
just put that out there
when do you believe the experts and when
do you believe the smart people who are
well informed
and when do you side with the dumb
people
you know do you do you ever feel uh
exposed and
maybe a little bit uh well let's put it
this way
if you take the same side as the most
educated and well-informed people
and you're wrong because you know you
could be wrong
um at least you don't look dumb because
at least you're on the side of all the
smart people and
you know you don't get them all right so
that's not the most embarrassing thing
but suppose the smart people were on one
side
and the dumb people were on another side
of whatever the issue is
and you sided with the dumb people and
you knew it
you knew it and then it turns out that
the dumb people were wrong
as you might expect dumb people to be
you know more often than not
so how would you feel about that if you
sided with the dumb people you knew you
were doing it
and then they turned out to be wrong
yeah i'm seeing lots of lots of examples
encounter
somebody says religion again
you're assuming you know the right
answer i guess the problem is that a lot
of these issues we don't know for sure
or agree on what was the right issue so
you'd have to have
a topic where somehow we all agreed what
was the right issue in the end
i don't know if there are any so there
are two lawsuits
very similar happening now in hollywood
so
gerard butler is suing his producers for
his movies olympia
olympus has fallen for 10 million
dollars because he had a deal where he
would get money at the
um based on the profits of the movie
on top of his pay for being in it and
they allegedly the hollywood accounting
is making it look like he has no profits
when in fact there are lots of profits
but they're giving him none so he's sue
again at the same time
black widow star johansson
is doing something similar because her
movie would give her
lots of money from the box office but
because of coved they streamed it
instead
and the streaming revenue was not in
their contract
in the same way so because it got
streamed she got cut out of she says
a whole bunch of money that would have
come her way now
here's my take on both of them they have
really bad lawyers
because what kind of a bad lawyer
lets a contract go out that says that
the producers of the studio could make
money
in some way and then then she doesn't
the star
if the whole point was that she's going
to share in the prophets
you've got to have a bad lawyer to say
you my star will share in the prophets
but only certain ones
that's crazy that's like the worst
lawyering i've ever heard
the lawyer should say that my client
will share in the profits
no matter how they are generated that's
it
no matter how they're generated if you
didn't put that in there
yeah or agents right the agents and the
agents and the lawyers are sort of the
same thing
in a sense um
and then with gerard butler let me tell
you how this went when i
negotiated my dilbert tv contract so i
was working with
one of the top lawyers in the industry
very experienced
top lawyer who knows how everything
works and when i got to the point where
i was negotiating the
money i would make on the extra profits
my lawyer basically said it doesn't
matter what you put in there you're not
getting a penny
that's what my lawyer told me it doesn't
matter what you're right there
they're they're going to game the
accounting so you don't get anything
so you should you should make your deal
with the assumption that there's no
money at the end
even if your contract says there's money
at the end because
they will find a way to rig the
accounting to take
to make it look like there was no profit
when in fact there was lots
now that's exactly what's happening the
the dilbert animated show
from years ago still runs on a number of
platforms
and how much profit do i get zero zero
do you think that it really has made
zero money
no of course not it's making tons of
money uh
you know i mean not tons but it's making
money
so the difference between my lawyer and
their lawyers is my lawyer told me my
lawyer said you're not going to get any
of this money even though your contract
clearly says so
it's never going to happen because
they're crooks you didn't use those
words
but he made it very clear that you're
dealing you're dealing with a criminal
enterprise basically
yeah again those were not my lawyers
words but you made it very clear this
is basically a criminal enterprise and
don't go into it
unless you understand that you will get
an initial check and that's your money
basically you're done
the rest the rest is just a con game
basically
so uh but there are people like robert
downey jr who did make
lots of money on the profits of the
movie so how do you explain the fact
that robert
downey jr makes it work but gerard
butler
and johansen scarlett johansson did not
and the answer is maybe better lawyer
number one maybe better lawyer but
number two
they can't make uh iron man movies
without iron man
they can make movies without scarlett
johansson
if they wanted to replace gerard butler
in the olympus's fallen
franchise or make something like it with
a different name or something
i feel like you could make those movies
without gerard butler
just you know put somebody else there
and i think you could make movies
without
scarlett johansson in you know black
widow type movies
but you can't really make iron man
without robert
dowdy junior kenya
uh i like the comment somebody's saying
doctor who
if you watch the series doctor who
british series
they replace the star every every year
or two so that the star never has any
power
which is pretty clever it's a up
thing to do
right i don't know if that's the reason
they do it there may be some other
reason
but the doctor who series that's been on
forever
they replace the main star every year
or every two or something and that way
the star is never
powerful enough to take too much of the
profits pretty clever
all right right um
so dave rubin who got
i guess limited on twitter they limit
the account
uh for saying that the i think
essentially for saying that
the vaccinations weren't quite what we
hoped they would be
and therefore we should rethink our
strategy because we have new information
now does that sound provocative
because it's not is pretty much what the
cdc says
hey we've got new information darn it
the vaccinations are not
as good as we'd hoped people can still
get it and spread it and
you might need a booster and all that so
basically what dave rubin says was
exactly what the cdc says he just used
different words
and so he got suspended but here's the
good news
twitter uh twitter reviewed it
and said it was a mistake twitter said
they made a mistake and they reversed
the
suspension now how do you feel about
that
do you feel and i think dave may have
had this feeling it's like
why does it always happen to the people
who have one set of views
is it happening to anybody else or is it
always
people with a certain perspective who
are the ones who get even the temporary
accidental mistake uh you know stuff
well it probably has to do with who's
talking about what topic more than
anything else
but i'm gonna say i give twitter
a uh i don't want to give it a grade
but i would say twitter did the right
thing
i don't think i can get mad about
somebody who makes a mistake corrects it
tells you they've made a mistake it's
just a different thing
to me i'm never going to treat those the
same as you know
some real big problem that lasts but
um you do have to wonder about why it
seems to happen to the same people all
the time
all right here's a a tricky persuasion
thing that's happening to us
all that it just grates me
when i feel myself being manipulated by
the powers it be
it's just a bad feeling here's what i
mean
the news treats everything that trump
did around january 6
and everything he said about the
election they treat it as
him causing a certain set of problems
and
you know did he want to overthrow the
government and everything
and there's a whole bunch of assumptions
you make that are all based
on one one fact
the assumption that he's wrong
right all of the reporting about january
6
and trump's claims they sort of start
with the assumption that he's wrong
has that been demonstrated because while
it is completely true
that no court has found any widespread
fraud
and i'm not i've i'm not aware of any
reporting
from any credible source that would say
there was any widespread fraud
but that has to do with the quality of
the reporting
and what kinds of cases would make it to
the court and
what do courts do in the first place
like what kind of things do they rule on
and so the only thing we know for sure
is we don't know
because it's an unauditable election
apparently
even the auditors can't get you know
record the electronic records and
so they can't get access to the routers
i think in arizona
so there's a bunch of stuff they can't
check and we don't have any evidence
that the audit produced or did not
produce any you know
great surprises
so it feels very manipulative
that the assumption is trump is wrong
as opposed to the assumption is that he
can't prove his case
those are really really different
aren't they an assumption that there was
no fraud
is really different from an assumption
that we don't know how to check for it
because guess what we don't know how to
check for it if you can't get access to
the routers
and apparently that matters to find out
if there's any
access to them i guess if you don't have
access to the routers
you don't have access to say chain of
custody because they don't exist
or something you can't really audit can
you
so it just bugs the enemy
that trump is assumed to be wrong
as opposed to has gone too far in making
his case because he can't know one way
or the other
very different
i saw some pushback on fox news
because they reported this that in
washington dc
i think it might have been i don't know
this week or yesterday or something
there were four cova deaths but 11
homicides
now fox news was being mocked by
a twitter user for reporting it that way
is that unfair to me that just feels
like useful context
how is it and i guess this is
you know mind-boggling so
fox news adds context to a story
that is true like its true context
and i would like to know the relative
size of things
i feel like this is a plus it's not the
whole story
and obviously you have to you have to
look at the rates of increase right
if the rate of increase of homicide is
20
or 40 percent it's pretty alarming
but it's not like a virus right the
virus can
go to the moon whereas homicide up 20
is horrible but you know looking at it
today
snapchat can be misleading
so i think you know if they wanted to
add a little extra context they would
have to say
uh very much like uh when we're afraid
of aids in the early days it wasn't how
many people had it
it was how many people you were afraid
were going to get it whereas with
homicide
it's really about how many happened it's
not so much about where you think the
rate is going to go in the future
so it's a little bit applest oranges but
still that context was good so i think
fox fox was completely
justified in showing that all right
so here's some some numbers
so that you can evaluate your
vaccination decision
here are some things that i think we
know and give me a fact check on this
okay
so whenever i give you coveted numbers
there should be a little
recording that plays in your head that
says but these numbers could be
completely off everything from god knows
what
so according to this er doctor alex
busco
in cnn i assume cnn would have
fact-checked this
and not let it in an opinion article if
it's wrong
but you said uh there's no that the
vaccinations have saved an estimated 275
000 lives in the u.s alone
does that sound about right let's just
take the range
let's say it was a hundred thousand
might have been five hundred thousand
you know what whatever
but do you think do you think that
that's a responsible estimate
given you know it doesn't have to be
exact but is that a responsible estimate
do you think it's in that range 275
000 american lives saved what do you
think
because that would be less than one
percent of the public
and that's where the death rate is
all right so i see a lot of yeses a lot
of yeses
but i do see some no's it feels right
i would say you know if you told me the
real number was a hundred thousand i
would say yeah
you know a hundred thousand three
hundred
i don't think we're good at estimating
things
but that might be you know order of
magnitude somewhere in that
range now how many people died from the
shot itself
the vaccination itself well we don't
know because it's hard to get those
numbers
but the vares database has 6200 people
who
seem to have died soon after getting the
vaccination
which doesn't mean it caused it it just
means it was a vaccination
and then somebody died soon after and
there's a question
maybe it caused it you don't know so
6200 maybes but
how many of the maybes do you think you
could actually count
maybe half what's your guess
of the people who simply coincidentally
died after the vaccination
do you think maybe half of them would
have died anyway
what'd you guess it was twelve thousand
they
they knocked it down to sixty two
hundred uh
with different estimates et cetera so
let's say it's you know somewhere under
ten thousand
would you buy the fact that there are 10
times as many people
who were saved by the vaccination
as there were killed by the shot
would it would anybody buy that there
are at least
10 times more people saved than
could that might have been killed and we
don't even know if there are any could
have been zero
because of the way that you measure this
okay
so i'm seeing some people say correct
all right
so i'm not telling you to get a
vaccination right because everybody's
your risks are different you know if
you're 15 it's different than if you're
60 right
so there's nothing i'm going to say here
that goes to your personal risk or your
decision
can we be clear on that because i know
you keep thinking i'm trying to secretly
persuade you if giving you accurate
information or updated information
has the effect of persuading you
that's on you i'm just telling you the
information
and information generally is not
persuasive in the
in the manipulative way if you do it
right if you keep it in context
so that's what we know but that's not
the only variable right if the only
variable
was how many people have died that it's
ten to one
would you agree with that would you
agree that if there was no other
no other consideration there's a ten to
one advantage
statistically at least i mean it could
be forty to one
right the the range is anywhere from
like ten to one to a hundred to one
but at least ten to one advantage of
getting the vaccination
based on what we know right now that's
not about complications it's not about
what happens down the road that's the
next question
now how many people who
don't get vaccinated but do get the
virus how many of them get
long-haul covet well i've seen estimates
of 25
which i don't believe but i think it's
at least
10 to 20 percent probably and we don't
know if any of that's permanent
so of the of the long hauls the people
who don't get
vaccinated maybe 10 to 20 percent of
them have some problems
but how many people would have long-haul
problem from the vaccination
what if you do get vaccinated and
although you didn't die or have a
long-term problem how many of those
people
do get some problem down the line and
the answer is you don't know
you don't know that's a complete unknown
if you believe that that unknown is a
big number
well then you have a reason not to get
vaccinated
but you would have to believe it's a
pretty big number because
if 10 to 20 are getting long-haul
problems
without the vaccination that vaccination
would have to be a
just a bastard to make it worth
not worth the risk can you agree
that the long-haul risk is really pretty
freaking big
in the context of these kinds of things
10 to 20
that's a really big number for people
with long haul that you don't know if
it's permanent
for some of them but do you think that
you're ever going to get to the point
where you'd get
10 to 20 percent of the people who were
vaccinated
who will have some kind of a bad outcome
some
somewhere down the line what do you
think
it's completely unestimatable isn't it
but
let's use your your life experience
this is very dangerous right what i'm
doing now is completely irresponsible
but
i'm telling you that so so you put it in
context
use your life experience and just
focus on one question which one
is more risk the vaccination far down
the line
doesn't kill you right away for sure but
far down the line
versus the the the unvaccinated covent
itself
you don't know because there's no data
but just feel it what's it feel like
which one feels like the bigger risk
boy you got quiet there's lots of
comments
but they're suddenly not on point are
they
all right i'm looking at your reason so
people saying
the vaccine is more risk there's no data
no idea hands down
the jab is more risk more risk than
and how do you determine that well i'll
ask you that in a second
all right so you see a lot of people who
are quite certain of the risk
with no
i saw something in the comments there
[Laughter]
you know who you are clever bastard
um
sorry that was funny so
so here we are what do you think of the
fact that people with no data
have certainty about something
what does that tell you people with no
data
because you don't know if the
vaccination will cause a problem in the
future no data
and you also don't know if long covet is
a real long-term problem or
really just a short-term one don't know
but how
but explain this to me explain what
would cause your sense of certainty
when you quite i think you would all
readily admit
there's no data so there's no
information
by which to make a decision none
whatsoever
and yet you have achieved certainty
among two choices of which you have zero
information
explain that now i'm not saying that
you're wrong
i'm only questioning what got you to a
point of confidence
and certainty with no information
because there's something in your life
experience that got you there right
right examine examine your own reasons
somebody said intuition i think you're
you're close to it
there's a feeling you have a feeling
right
and it's based on your life experience
you might call that feeling intuition
right it might be a question of trust
your life experience gives you a certain
amount of trust in the experts
the medical experts and your life
experience gives you a certain amount of
well instinct let's say about what
having a virus would do to you in the
long run
this particular virus yeah i'm saying
dunning krueger and you're not wrong
um if you knew educated people believe
in critical race theory
would you believe it well i think
critical race theory has
way more to do with how it's being
taught than whether it's a good idea or
not but i see your point
that's that's a pretty good example of
what we talked about earlier
um how do people override failure from
life experience i
read my book kind of failed almost
everything and still went big
backstabbed scott
well who stabbed you in the back
so do you know did you see what happened
in the
in the comments as soon as i asked the
question
how did you achieve certainty in your
vaccination decision when you had zero
there's zero data how did you do that
and everybody just changed the subject
do you realize
how many of you had an epiphany
typically in a conversation like this
something like five to ten percent of
you just said oh
did anybody have that experience has
anybody just in the last
like five minutes did anybody say
oh i just made i arrived at
certainty
with no information whatsoever anybody
now i'd expect that the vast majority
you were just
hardening your current decisions
so i'm seeing all no's so far
there's no certainty it looks like
there's
nobody here who would say that they're
somebody says the big fu says
poor scott just doesn't get it
get what um i guarantee that whoever
said that
that scott doesn't get it i guarantee
that whatever you would say after that
to explain that is something that
everybody gets
you're gonna say some dumb thing
like it's about freedom
scott no you idiot everybody
knows it's about freedom and choice
you jerk right
let me just insult one of my watchers
here
you're idiot if you think i
don't get it right
put a reason tell me something i don't
know in the comments
but if you're thinking well hold on hold
on i've got a request
i've been getting quite a few requests
uh for somebody
that you call dale
um and i'd like dale to come on and
explain to me what i don't understand
scott you don't get it you don't get it
you don't understand it's about personal
choice
yeah i understand that i say it all the
time in fact every single day
i've said it's about personal choice
every single
 day well what you don't
understand
is that these have not been fda approved
you don't understand you don't get it
they haven't been fda approved
i know that and i know what it implies i
know what it applies for risk
i incorporate that in all of my decision
making
well but you don't get that the vares
database
says people are dying from the
vaccination you don't get it you just
i'll get it
i just talked about it i gave you the
number
and i compared it to the estimate which
i don't believe
of how many people were saved by it but
it's in that range somewhere probably
you just don't get it you just don't get
it okay but what
what exactly don't i get is there some
fact i don't know
you don't get it yeah just don't get it
you're trying to manipulate us
you don't get it
all right now i don't know how many of
you wanted dale to come back
but there you go
so i remind you again that i love
disagreement
if i've got a fact wrong blah blah blah
just tell me
that this show is not about being right
all the time you know even though i
arrogantly
act like i'm right all the time that's
just part of the show and you should
understand that
right it just makes it more fun if i
show more certainty than i
than i deserve um
but i try to tell you when i'm doing
that
scott can never be wrong i'll tell you
the there are two things
that i spend a lot of time on number one
is telling you how wrong i was i spent a
lot of time
talking in public about how wrong i was
and mistakes i made i wrote a whole book
about my mistakes probably nobody
has ever talked more about
the things they've up than i have
so i spend half of my time talking about
all the mistakes i've made and where i
was wrong
and i spend the other half my time
dealing with trolls who say
why can't you ever admit you're wrong
is i i live in this absurd world
where my critics accuse me of exactly
the opposite of whatever is happening
like there's no correlation between what
i'm being criticized for i said this on
twitter the other day
and oh i gotta run sorry gotta go
oops
