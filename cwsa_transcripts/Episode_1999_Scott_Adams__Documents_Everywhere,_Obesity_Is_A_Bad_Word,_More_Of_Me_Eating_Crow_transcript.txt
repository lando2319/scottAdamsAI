oh
oh shoot
oh I don't know what to do now
I found a classified item
in my drawer
um I need to call the FBI immediately
hello FBI yeah I I know I feel stupid
now I found a classified item
it was an it was in my drawer I don't
know who put it there
probably my assistant I assumed my
assistant assistants are terrible with
classified information I I didn't even
know it was there really
so I thought I would
what the hell
you're busy
oh well what's taking you so long
bribing taking bribes from oligarchs
yeah that can take a lot of time out of
your schedule all right well I guess
I'll just handle it myself
okay all right and you have a good day
too
why is my phone yelling at me
well if you'd like to take today's
classified top secret experience up to
levels you've never known before
this is how you do it all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker Chelsea
style and a canteen jug or flask of a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
is called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
do you see behind me
two white boards
is there anything that can be better
than coffee with Scott Adams and two
white boards
yes
three or more white boards
it's a trick question
all right there is so much news today
I'm just going to run through the run
through the important stories
I'm going to start at the top with the
most important stories and then we'll
work down
toward the end
I will be eating crow for all of my
wrongness about the Pandemic those of
you who like to watch me be wrong
this would you should wait till the end
but the important stories first
and nothing more important than this one
a w root beer has announced that its
mascot Rudy the great root bear
um who formerly wore a shirt but no
pants
and they announced that uh their bear
might be polarizing polarizing
it's a bear
the bear might be polarizing uh if you
had no pants
and so now they're going to put pants on
their bear
thank God
you know I woke up this morning I'm like
no
pantsless mascots must be fixed
now you know this made me think
I've seen a lot of videos of bears in
the wild haven't you
and like sometimes you'll see the the
Grizzlies
the Grizzlies will be standing up and
they're like how big is a grizzly it's
like eight feet tall right
when it stands up it's like ah like this
you know what I've never seen
is a bear's package you know the boy
bears
now
because they're standing like this and
they're big old you know bears
I feel like if I were in the woods
and one of these grizzly bears attacked
me like I'd have two reactions you know
when I saw the bear and the bear went
like this my first reaction will would
be oh no I'm gonna die
and then my second reaction would be
whoa you really packing
like that's how I imagined it would go
because I just figured Grizzlies
they got game I don't know I just assume
that another important story
60 minutes and Leslie Stahl was uh
interviewing I guess some a woman who's
going to be in charge of the new
government's dietary guidelines
um who says that obesity is mostly
genetic
genetic and that you won't lose weight
just by eating less and exercising
so you know at first I thought well that
seems contrary to all common sense and
all science but then I thought oh wait a
minute Scott back up
it's coming from the government
so now I believe it
all right next story
which is also related
I I saw a tweet saying that obesity is
like the new n-word for the the people
who are
who are large
now I remind you that we do not do fat
shaming
don't do fast Jamie because as I often
say if I liked food as much as other
people I might weigh more
that that's my entire analysis so
therefore
I I don't fat shame because I would be
one
if I liked food more than I do I just
don't I'm just not crazy about food you
know I don't like sleep so much not big
on food I do them because I have to
uh but I saw a tweet from uh
Dr Anita B Eden PhD
who says obesity is the n-word
and
or her uh her alleged profile
says that she's a fat affirming
dietitian with a PhD in body positive
medicine
and she's the author of snacks over
scales
and health at every Happy Meal
she's a feminist Ally and her pronouns
are she and her
now
here's the funny part
I I literally couldn't tell
if it was a parody for a few minutes
like I had to spend some time looking at
it I thought
Anita be eaten
I need to be eaten
okay probably not real
but the the only take away from this is
that the difference between complete
parity
and reality is so thin now it's so thin
that you can really get away with parody
like crazy because people can't tell
they genuinely can't tell when you're
kidding
so I mean the fact that people can't
tell when you're kidding
I mean that opens a big opportunity for
somebody like me
but you know I would never take care
take advantage of that
um did you know that China has more than
the tick tock app oh they have way more
than that they have an app called WeChat
now it's mostly used in China I think
but there are 19 million users of WeChat
in the United States I think mostly
Chinese Americans or or people with a
more direct connection to China but it
does all kinds of things like payments
and you know it's just like a universal
app kind of thing uh
but apparently there are 19 million
American users and China can monitor all
their data and they basically know
everything about them
that's not too scary is it
but speaking of apps from China I saw on
the Wall Street Journal that the Biden
Administration is considering
so watch out watch out everybody they're
considering
and when when they're considering
that's that's something that's something
so they're considering doing something
about data safety with tick tock
what
uh so the Wall Street Journal apparently
along with the Biden Administration are
unaware
that the risk with Tick Tock has very
little to do with the data
I mean that's important you know they
should control the data but they're
missing the whole story
that Tick Tock and WeChat are literally
well mostly Tick Tock is literally
literally
literally right you're going to think
this is not really the right use of the
word literally but no literally used
actually as literally
should be used
Tick Tock is a user interface for the
Chinese government to control American
Minds
literally
it's literally an interface
it literally controls American Minds
it's not a metaphor
it's not an analogy it's not it reminds
me of just literally an interface to
control American lions no problem the
the Biden Administration but at least
they're considering
they're giving a strong consideration
boy they're considering it so hard smoke
is coming out of their brains
they're considering so hard dealing with
something that isn't the issue
the data also important but
not nearly in the top one percent with
the user interface for controlling
brains no problem just let that issue go
um
Amazon has announced its its Prime
members are going to have some kind of
amazing deal on generics
so for five dollars a month for generics
so it's going to be like super cheap
generics through Amazon and it's most of
the big stuff
and uh I got all excited about this I
thought wow oh this could be good uh
it's not active in my state California
or Texas
why would something not be legal in
California and Texas
what what do those two even have in
common that they would have the same
opinion on this
I'm missing the reason why
just money but why would it be different
for
for you know a red and a blue State I
don't even just population
I don't know I don't understand this
story so maybe somebody could work that
out but
um
so if you're on Medicare
or Medicaid you can't use it and if
you're in California or Texas you can't
use it does any of that make sense to
you no this would be a good case of our
government it looks like they're not
really serving urges in this case but I
I'm available to hear a better argument
maybe I'm missing something
but just to me it just looks like the
government's just getting in the way of
a good thing
am I wrong
no it wasn't accidental to answer your
question on locals
um but sometimes I don't give reasons
sometimes it's just personal
for blocking all right so here's my take
on that uh just the day before I heard
this I saw a tweet by I believe it was
Doc Anarchy on Twitter warning against
taking generic drugs uh now the argument
is that the generics have uh less
quality control
would you agree
I don't know if that's the case often or
usually or always I've heard this is
something I've heard but I've you know I
don't know how I would validate it
and I think it depends right and but
would you know in advance which which
meds
it depended
yeah I don't know uh I would say that
I suppose if you take the generics first
and you don't get a good result maybe
try the name brand is that the way to
play it you know depending if it's life
and death I suppose if it's life and
death I might take the name brand first
but let's say it's something like blood
pressure
in the short run it's not really life of
death so if in the short run it didn't
work
maybe you try the other thing
all right
um
Matt Gates continues to say the most
interesting things and do the most
interesting things in Congress here's a
little I'm gonna I'm just gonna read to
you
uh several things that Matt gase has
said recently
all right so not in the same day but
just different tweets just recently I
want you to pick up the pattern here
and the pattern I'm looking for well I
guess I'm priming you for the pattern so
you don't have to look for it the
pattern is
he seems to say exactly what you want
him to say
and he seems to be focusing on the
priorities
that are apparently exactly the ones you
would want him to focus on
and what's weird about it is that it
stands out
isn't that weird
that he's simply doing his job
and like stands out
like why does that stand out let me just
read the things he said recently and you
see if you can you see it maybe in case
it's my imagination right so just in no
order these are things he said either on
a podcast or in his own tweets quote our
FBI is corrupted by political interest
domestically and compromised by Foreign
interests financially
how important is that
like right at the top right that's
really really important to us
and he just says it directly there's
there's no hedging here like the part
you don't want to hear is all the weird
hedging no this is just a fact now
and he just puts it right out there
directly
here's another one I'm not here for the
document drama
I think having people in the National
Security apparatus trying to shape the
presidential field is not a good thing
regardless of your political persuasion
so he doesn't care about the documents
okay I'm totally on board I think we
enjoy the documents as a political
conversation but I don't think anybody
thinks they're important so I agree with
them and then he they says that by
having the National Security apparatus
shape our presidential field yes
yeah what's more important than that yes
that's like right at the top of things
you should be caring about who else is
talking about it
that's the question
uh then Matt Gates asked we are now
funding Ukraine's government in our own
why should Ukraine get less oversight
because the money that goes to Ukraine
just goes into a black box of corruption
and the money that we spend in America
we at least try to figure out where it
went
is that a good point
yes it's probably the only good point
about Ukraine
it's the only point we should all agree
on you know you could disagree whether
you should be there or not or how you're
handling it but should there be any
disagreement
on we should know exactly where our
money goes now how important is it well
it's trillion well not trillions yet but
there's billions and billions of dollars
yeah really really important thank you
Matt gates for pointing that out
uh another one
those who perpetrated the Russia
occlusion hoax on American people were
in fact taking corrupt cash from Russia
so that's the new story about the FBI
agent who was doing that
how important is that
really really really important
really important
so I get so do you see it
I'm not imagining right that Matt Gates
is accurately picking up the most
important things mostly to his base but
I would argue they should be important
to everybody
um I don't know he's continuing to
impress with what I guess you could call
a comeback but since the charges were
dropped in that whole case
there's really nothing to come back from
so he's doing great and somehow he's
managed to continue to be a
full-throated supporter of trump and it
doesn't seem to be hurting him
somehow he's pulling this all off of
that you're gonna have to keep an eye on
that
because when you see that much skill
it usually predicts
all right
uh oh let's see he also said
that's why Jim Jordan and I will hold
hearings bring whistleblowers forward
and demand answers to determine How Deep
The Rock goes talking about the
intelligence agencies and FBI
of course
uh and then and then here's also Bill
Gates I think he said this on Tim cast
we had bills that broke bills you know
legislation we had bills that broke up
big Tech we were we were waiting for
them to come to the floor
then on the dip you know because the Big
Tap
big dip the Big Tap big tech stocks went
down because Congress was you know going
to scrutinyson and then he says that
when they went down Paul Pelosi bought a
bunch of those stocks
and then those bills never went to the
floor
Nancy Pelosi
now how important is that really really
important like really really really
important
uh so again he's just all the right
things now apparently Senator Hawley has
introduced the Pelosi Act
which is would uh would disallow
members of Congress from Trading
individual stocks now they could still
invest they would just buy you know
um mutual funds and stuff like that
there are a few ways they can do it they
just wouldn't be making their own
decisions on individual stocks
so uh who knows if that will get passed
it would be embarrassing to vote against
it how could you vote against that
really
could you you're a member of Congress
and you would vote for allowing yourself
to have a special information and buy
stocks who could vote for that
I'm sure the Democrats will find some
reason to to object but it's going to be
hilarious to hear that reason
all right here's what the Pelosi act
stands for so you know they always make
the ACT it's not just because it's about
Pelosi it's it's
you know a generic thing so the Pelosi
stands for preventing elected leaders
from owning Securities and Investments
Pelosi
I I can't I can't give them a compliment
for how they're governing the country
can't do it
but their ability to make up clever uh
clever names for legislation
unparalleled
unparalleled
yeah
so good job there
um
here's something that I need a fact
check on
so you all know Robert F Kennedy Jr
right
everybody knows Robert F Kennedy
very active in the vaccination
conversations both prior to covet and
and throughout
and he tweeted uh tweeted at me today I
didn't realize he follows me on Twitter
but he tweeted at me today and he was
telling me that at Children's HD and
hashtag the defender I don't know what
they are they must be Twitter entities
as a more robust and rigorous
fact-checking operation than any Legacy
news provider remember I was telling you
that what we need
is some kind of independent fact checker
for medical recommendations you know
somebody who can say well that used to
be a good pill but you know there's a
new study that says you shouldn't take
it you know that that sort of thing so a
consumer can get a medical
recommendation then just check it
against somebody who's good at research
not necessarily a doctor just somebody
who's good at research
and so anyway so uh
that's who Robert F Kennedy Jr
recommends the children's Children's HD
I don't know what that is and and
hashtag the defender
but then he goes on
he says let me know if we ever Heir oh
he must be involved with this so he goes
let me know if we ever Heir so I guess
he has some involvement in those
entities or one of them and uh we will
apologize and correct
and then here's the part that just
totally threw me this is his last
sentence of the Tweet he says he's
tweeting to me he says thanks Scott for
inspiring me to give surgery for my
spasmodic dysphonia
what
now I know I recommended it and I I
tried to get that message to him a few
different ways but I wasn't sure that he
had the same well I know that he doesn't
have exactly the same form of uh
spasmodic dysphodia that's a voice
disorder
um
as I had but there are two flavors and I
thought he might have the other flavor
and I wasn't sure if there was a surgery
for that one but apparently there is now
what I don't know is if he's still
recovering from it or because we haven't
heard him speak well in public yet right
is that true
we have not heard him speak well in
public
which means he may be actually
recovering right now has anybody seen
him in public recently
because and then I did a quick Google
search I didn't see anything about it
oh he was on Tucker and sounds better
and he was on Tucker last week and did
he sound better
oh really
well I'm gonna have to look that up that
would be amazing
I I hope this is I hope that I actually
helped you know I've told you before
that the weirdest thing about my life
is how many medical cures uh I've been
behind
you know that I've literally caused
people to heal in a variety of ways now
one of them is I was promoting uh the
surgical solution for what had been an
incurable problem for forever
and anybody who got that surgery and got
fixed
if they heard it for me then you know
then it helped
and there are a number of other
you know diseases and stuff that I've
helped with directly and indirectly
all right the menu movie okay
so uh good luck to Robert F Kennedy Jr
on his voice travels if if his
experience is like mine
I'm shy bladder for example if his
experiences like mine the recovery
period lasts a long time
so your your voice will be better fairly
quickly but then it just continues
improving as you
you know as your vocal mechanism heals
to its perfect state
so I think it took me years actually
years from my voice to normalize
but it did
all right Rasmussen uh poll says that
the GOP is just creeping the Democrats
on these three issues energy immigration
and spending
those seem like pretty big issues don't
they
energy immigration and spending the
public by majority not not just the
plurality but by an actual solid
majority which means the independence
and Democrats a little bit are crossing
over so here are the numbers uh 53
percent of likely U.S voters trust
Republicans more than more to handle
immigration
so Republicans on immigration 53 percent
only 36 percent trust Democrats and then
you know there's the people in between
that's a huge difference
the the Republicans just have a solid
winning position on immigration
now I'll say it again
if Trump comes in and just says the same
things he used to say about immigration
he will give away all of the advantage
am I right
if he just acts the way he always acts
it says the same things he always says
he will give away all of the advantage
all he needs to do is just play it we
need to control the border and then we
need to separate the question of who
comes in
just one little change
just separate the question of who comes
in
from the management of the physical
border you just do that you own the
topic
such a small change and one that Trump
would not disagree with do you think
Trump would disagree
with separating the physical security
which he wants
from the decision of how much to open
the door no he said that directly right
he said the big beautiful door
so that you can let people in but you do
it you know reasonably and logically
so I think you know I mean this is just
like a huge Super Highway for a
republican to just walk into the office
at this point yeah so energy of course
uh
you know the Republicans are better on
energy let's say uh
oh 48 trust Republicans so it's not over
50 but only 40 trust Democrats again
it's a pretty big difference between 40
and 48.
and
and then on environmental policy 43
percent trust Republicans and exactly
the same trust Democrats
hmm
what about crime and Homeland defense
that's not the subject of this this poll
do you think that Republicans Or
democrats would win with the general
public on crime oh spending this is the
third one sorry
and somewhere there's something about
spending
uh 50 trust Republicans more on spending
and only 35 percent trust uh Democrats
thank you and so what about crime and
Homeland defense you know National
Defense don't you think Republicans win
that too
like I haven't seen the numbers recently
but I think so right
so this would mean that Republicans are
better on
uh fiscal things I think you could call
that the economy
fiscal handling
uh energy
the environment
immigration
crime and Homeland defense
and the election is still going to be
close
thank goodness for uh mailing voting huh
because it doesn't look like we would
have a two-party system anymore if we
didn't have uh interesting election
mechanisms
I don't think it would even be close
the polling shows that you couldn't win
as a Democrat today
am I wrong
because here's the other thing
here here's the thing that the
Republicans did
brilliantly
here's something they did brilliantly
they got they got abortion over with
right they got it over with so they they
took a hit the Republicans took a huge
hit
by you know uh changing pushing it back
to the States but now there's pushed
back to the States
that's done it's pushed back to the
States it's completely a state issue now
so if you just wait a bit longer
nobody's going to be voting because of
Roe versus Wade for the at the federal
level they'll definitely vote at the
state level but at the federal level the
Republicans have I think
you know this is a psychology question
so you can't know for sure
but I think the Republicans have removed
their biggest negative issue
by dealing with it fast basically they
rip the Band-Aid off
you know what Republicans are good at
ripping the Band-Aid off
am I right
if you had if you had to pick somebody
to rip the Band-Aid off and just take
the pain and get on with it just take
the pain do it now
just just eat the now and get on
with it it's always going to be
Republican I know it's a general a gross
generalization but it does seem to be
built into the philosophy
all right uh Pence has documents so
ex vice president Pence
uh discovered some classified documents
in his home
but apparently it's all taped shot and
it's maybe one box let me put it in a
safe and he did all the right things so
uh Pence
I I'm going to say it for the millionth
time
because I love it when somebody just
does all the right things and then they
just keep doing it
Pence
is probably the most reasonable
grounded
Patriot
of all time like the fact that he stays
in his Lane and just like Masters he
Masters his domain I know that's a funny
reference but he's sort of a master of
his domain and like even the thing that
we laugh to him the most that he
wouldn't go to lunch with a woman unless
his wife was there totally right
totally Pence was so right about that
the pens rule don't don't do something
with a woman who's not your wife totally
right like but nobody's been more right
than that ever in the history of
rightness
simple
okay well he's playing the odds right I
think
all right well we have to talk about
mass shootings you know I've told you
that I don't like to talk about the
individual shootings and crime I don't
like to give them attention and uh I
don't have much to offer right because
it's always the same argument it's just
a different shooting
but I'm going to make one alarming
prediction we see already that the
number of mass shootings is starting to
really hockey stick up
right everybody
sees it now like the number of mass
shootings is just climbing
that is not going to stop
do you know why
do you know why the number of mass
shootings is going to Skyrocket
not because of gun ownership
not because of gun ownership I mean you
it requires gun ownership it wouldn't
happen without it but it's not the
reason it's going to Skyrocket
all right I'm just going to say the same
thing that I said on Twitter
men know
men now
women don't know what's happening
women are completely confused do you
know why women are confused
because they don't give a about men
that's the whole reason women don't care
anything about men what they think what
they feel what their situation in
society is and how it's basically going
to crap you have an entire gender
who don't have any hope
they don't think they're going to date
because Tinder took away their dating
options because only only the top 10
date
you can't date
so if you can't date
you can't get married
you can't afford getting married
you can't have a kid
and if you did you would be the third
class citizen in the marriage you would
be less important than the wife less
important to the kids less important
than the dog
and that's what men have to look forward
to men have what they what they have
looked to look forward to is putting a
lot of investment in something that
won't pay off
there's no longer a path for men now
that might be true for women as well I
don't know because the same way that
women don't have a full appreciation for
men men don't have a full appreciation
for women and vice versa and whites and
blacks and everybody else young and old
actually young and old is the only one
where I think the old can still have
some appreciation for the young because
at least they used to be young
so that might be the one the one time
that somebody can understand the other
category
is old people can sometimes understand
young people but not totally
so
everything that I see suggests that the
number of men who have no hope and just
want to do something exciting before
they die
are going to do this
and that doesn't explain all of them you
know some of them are just a beef at
work and some of them are crazy people
and all that but I think you're going to
see like the bottom
10 percent of men who just don't have
any hope but they do have access to guns
and they're just going to make
themselves important because Society has
made them unimportant
so
let me ask you that so my take is that
nobody cares about men and they know it
we all know it
and that they don't have hope anymore
because Society has changed women don't
really need men
and women have stopped wanting to have
babies
and men can't afford to be you know the
sole breadwinner
so
are you all buying this
I you know what's interesting I don't
see anybody pushing back
I see no pushback
right
now
uh I'm going to go further and say that
men generally understand this
women probably only understand it
because they're hearing it and it sort
of makes sense when you hear it but did
you know this how many of you women
understood that the situation for men is
beyond dire
you know Dyer is where you just you know
you're you're uncomfortable and you know
it's serious we're we're all the way to
men are just going to kill themselves
and as many people as they can kill at
the same time
because they don't give
a darn
see how see how well I did that was
totally a place where I would have sworn
if this were not 2023 I totally would
have let loose a whole tirade of
horrible words but I did not I held back
I held back it wasn't easy
all right so mass shooting you should
expect them to Skyrocket and expect that
nobody will do anything about it because
uh
nobody cares about men
they'll just go after the guns
here's a simulation alert so you know
the Schiff and swallow got kicked off
the Intel committee McCarthy did uh
pretty awesome job talking to reporters
in public and telling him why he kicked
those two people off and I think most
most republican-leaning people looked at
that and said yep that is what we wanted
that's that is exactly why we want you
to be in charge if you're happy with
McCarthy if you are that's why
that he gave the right answer he
basically said you know they're they're
available for other committees
we're not saying that they can't be in
Congress that's not up to us we're just
saying this one specific thing requires
somebody who are not gigantic liars and
those two proof that they lied to the
country about
about classified information they didn't
just lie in general which would be you
know everybody in Congress
they lied about the stuff that only they
could see now that was more uh Schiff I
don't know what the swallow thing is now
the swallow well spy thing I'm going to
go with Matt Gates on that that maybe
we're making too much of that because
that happened a long time ago and it
wasn't when he was in Congress
so you can use your own judgment about
that the only thing I'd like to add to
this conversation and I haven't heard
anybody do it
is that we make fun of small welfare
allegedly having gas on camera that
didn't really happen but it's a funny
story
um and we of course we make fun of Chef
because his last name reminds us of
something
so what are the odds that we're in this
simulation and the two people in the
headlines are literally Schiff and fart
yeah Schiff and fart the two guys that
got kicked off the intelligence
committee
chef and fork
come on is that funny
no
okay
well moving on that's all I had for that
that's all I had but
that's my only commentary
um
so Ukraine is interesting in the sense
that it feels like the US is at War but
we're doing War the way war will be
fought in the future
which with which is we'll use our
technology
and we'll get people who
are you know more local to the problem
to do the fighting and dying
so it feels to me like the United States
is at war with Russia and we're just
using Ukraine as as a cut out now
ukrainians think they're at war with
Russia but from my perspective it just
looks like we're at war with Russia and
we're just doing it in this semi-clever
way so that Russia doesn't treat it like
exactly like a war with the United
States it's like a deniable War that's
obviously a war it's a weird little
thing like we're all pretending it's one
thing when it's obviously another thing
but even Andrew Yang was saying he's a
tweeted today he was glad the U.S is
going to send Abram's tanks to Ukraine
and then I guess the Germans are also
going to send their leopard two tanks
and I don't know a ton about tanks but
I'm guessing
tanks are mostly offensive weapons right
is that true
tanks are mostly offensive weapons
which would suggest that Ukraine's
getting ready for an offensive
so is Ukraine going to go into Crimea
I feel like I feel like Ukraine's
Ukraine's best play would be to make a
move into Crimea suck all of Russia's
resources out of the disputed areas
then you know then you can take over the
disputed areas because they'll just have
conscripts and and crap there and then
also when in in Crimean you're done
so if they can bring the depleted
Russian forces into Crimea because they
would have to go right there's no way
that Russia would you know allow Crimea
to not be perfectly defended because he
can't lose Crimea but it looks like
Ukraine is getting ready for a headshot
the headshot is Crimea right if Putin
loses Crimea like just loses it
that's pretty bad on his end like that
would be hard for him to even stay in
office without people really questioning
his abilities at that point
so you say the 30 to 50 tanks without
air superiority would be meaningless
Yeah by themselves sure
but it would help so here's the question
uh you're missing the pollen role that's
coming unbelievable
unbelievable if there's one thing that
you're disappointed in me it's that I
haven't seen that one person on Twitter
who told you something you believe and
that's unbelievable that I'm missing
that
now I don't I make uh
let me let me say as clearly as possible
wow that sounded like
cringe on prayer let me be as clear as
possible
I don't know what's going to happen in
Ukraine
how would I know
I'm just saying you know as as Observers
it looks like that's what they're
clearing up to do now whatever's
happening in Poland and Belarus and all
that there's probably a hundred things
that I'm not taking into account but on
the surface
it looks like they're going to threaten
Crimea the drain drain Russia into
Crimea and then they'll they'll have a
better situation when the the snow goes
away that's what I think
and then maybe Russia is planning its
own advance
so I would I would say after the snow
melts
uh it's a free-for-all would you agree
with that after the snow melts there's
no way to know if Russia or CR or
Ukraine will have the advantage because
they're both gearing up and we don't
know who's gearing up better there's no
way to know so all hell is going to
break loose
but it's unpredictable after this
so if it sounded like I predicted
something I didn't
all right
um I'm gonna eat some more Crow today
for those of you who like to see me be
wrong
um
here's what I think of proper apology
should include
It's never enough to just apologize is
it
an apology should come with you know you
know the harm you did
you know first the apology that you
acknowledge the harm you did
but then you've got to do the third
thing and the third thing is the hard
thing
the third thing is you have to create a
plan so you don't do it again or at
least you have to tell people what
you're going to do differently so you
will not make that same mistake again so
I did a deep dive
on the people who got the pandemic stuff
right
and I learned
much more about where I got it wrong
and with your Indulgence I would like to
take some moment to beat myself up
for missing some really obvious signals
really obvious signals that you did not
miss
all right so
this is what I've learned so I've talked
to quite a few people about how they got
the right answer when I got all the
wrong answers
and here's
what I learned
so this this was roughly the decision
tree
that we were dealing with
so the question was so the young people
and the old people I think we all agree
have a different risk factor
so in the but individually it was the
same same layout just different risk
factors so you would look at the risk of
the shot itself
and when they did they said oh that is
greater than the risk of covet death
which is practically nothing
would you all agree so far the risk of
dying of covid even really early on well
before the Vex vaccination so-called
vaccinations were available we really
knew that for most people
the risk of death was vanishingly small
agree
so in that case the risk of the shot
would certainly for the young people
would be greater than the risk of dying
of covet
and then and then then that's the end of
the conversation
so it's just the risk of the shot
versus the risk of the cover death and
then if that's bigger you're done
so a lot of people correctly looked at
the data they did their own research and
they looked at the numbers even even the
farman numbers when they looked at them
they said holy cow the risk of the shot
for young people
is definitely bigger than the risk of
dying from the covet itself so I would
be crazy to get the shot
because that's a higher risk than the
covet and then and then they were done
it's all you need to know and I'll tell
you how they how they determine this
risk in a minute
is there anything I'm leaving out
I don't think so so but then there's a
second part of the analysis uh that when
I say young I mean people under 65.
the people under 65
said their risk of getting the shot was
greater than the risk of covet
and therefore I made a mistake
so even though I'm in the 65 and older
category
because the young people did the
research they felt that the risk of the
shot is greater than risk of covet
I made a big mistake by getting a shot
now that wasn't obvious to me before
because I thought these were different
risk profiles
but after talking to a lot of people
they're quite clear on it that when they
analyze their own risk
and then they compared what they did to
what I did I made the wrong decision
so
I'm learning from that
now before we go on is there anything on
here I've not discussed yet
because I learned that there's this
other box that I thought was real
that I learned is not even real
did you know that
a lot of people knew the risk of long
covet
way before the medical community
and they just said no I know this risk
now I thought it was unknown
now let's also do a definition my
definition of long covid would include
several months of feeling like crap
not necessarily you know years I mean it
could be years but my definition was
months now if you're a young person and
you got long covered
probably you would kick it in you know a
few days is no big deal don't you think
like the young people just like brush
off the cover because they never they
don't get sick they don't get that sick
in the first place
so you'd expect if they don't get that
sick their risk of long covet is
probably zero now if you're an older
person let's say you're over 65.
let me tell you one of my own just like
a personal medical
criteria
if I get any kind of major medical
problem
whether it's covid or I break my leg
do you know what happens to you when
you're 65
and you lose let's say several months of
good health
do you know what happens
I'll tell you what I think happens I
think you never recover
like never
as in you don't recover now I say you
don't recover I mean you'll never get
back to your Fitness
the fitness level before because it's
just too hard to crawl back when you're
a certain age
so I've always been concerned that my
health which is very good at my current
age is very good I've always and I had
my blood done it's just perfect
everything's good and I was concerned I
was always concerned that if some major
problem happened
um that it would take me a year or more
to recover now I'll give you an example
when during the pandemic I had to take
prednisone to get ready for some sinus
surgery
now because of the pandemic my surgery
was delayed
so they put me on Prednisone the second
time
and then I got delayed and then they put
me on a third time you should never be
on three doses of Prednisone like long
doses in one year because getting off it
is really really hard like you feel
terrible for a long time now the
prednisone problem alone
probably took nine months out of my life
because for months and months it I could
barely exercise and you know barely get
up to where I am now now at the moment
I'm back up to my Peak everything's good
but it took me maybe a year
to get back
I was concerned that if I got long
covered and just had a normal you know
week-long terrible covet
that what would happen is that I would
lose a year of quality life
and maybe you would never get back to
where it was so remember when a young
person gets long covered that's not
really much of a problem they'd probably
just shake it off but
if a long if a older person got it that
would be a criteria now what I learned
was I'm the only person on this live
stream who cares about long covet to me
that was the biggest variable
but what I learned is you can just
ignore it because you don't know anybody
who had this problem
I hadn't thought of that but if you
don't know anybody personally who has
had long covert
or you think it's just ordinary people
get sick and then it takes a while to
recover then you wouldn't worry about
this but I was just watching Joe
Scarborough yesterday Joe Scarborough
said that at least Mika his wife was on
this who's on the show said that he took
like three months to recover from his
most recent covet and that was just
Omicron
I don't know how old Joe Scarborough is
but he lost three months of his life
three months of quality living he lost
to one infection now I thought but of
course you can't trust the government
that if the if the shots did nothing but
decrease how much you suffered
it would probably decrease your long
covet because the long covet probably
comes from how bad your original
infection is I just assume they're
connected but I don't have I don't have
any
science for that all right so what I
learned here is that as long as you
think young people know people should be
treated the same and as long as you
ignore what I think is the biggest risk
because none of us believe that the risk
of dying if you're youngish and healthy
was worth considering
so I think we all discounted the risk of
dying if we were generally young enough
and healthy enough and even I'm young
enough you know even at 65
I'm young enough to think that the risk
of dying was basically zero
but I didn't know about this one so I
didn't do the right thing
which is uh to Discount my biggest risk
so I should have said my biggest risk
was actually zero and then I would have
gotten the right answer now here's how I
would have done it
I'll tell you this Crow tastes good
you know this girl
so
we start with science and there was lots
of science around the covid and about
the the vaccination and the science was
doing all the randomized controlled
trials and then meta-analysis and the
data they did the observational studies
in the peer review and that part
that part we all appreciate
the science doesn't get the right answer
every time
but at least it's a process that we
respect would you agree you know it's we
we're crawling toward the truth usually
through a lot of wrongness until you get
to the truth so the science isn't about
being totally right the first try it's
it's a process
and there were at least three different
ways that people you know departed from
science to make their decision
the dumbest people
um listened to the government and big
Pharma and the news and said well that
sounds right
if if these three entities which have
lied to us consistently forever if they
say it's okay
I'm taking it and then they got the
wrong answer
right so they believed people now a lot
of people thought I was in this group
but I wasn't in that group I was in this
group
um
I thought I didn't understand anything
about the science and didn't have a way
to really understand it
so I used my penis to make my decision
and my penis said if I get the
vaccination
I can go on a trip to Santorini
later to Bora Bora
with a beautiful woman
instead of being locked down
with covet now so I used my penis
and my penis
I don't like to admit this
my penis has a terrible track record
for decisions I don't know about yours
and I know many of you don't have a
penis so I'm just speaking to those who
do is your penis smart
because my penis doesn't know anything
like I keep expecting it to like make
good decisions and I'm like hey
what do you think we should do about
taxes
nothing
basically won't even help me on my taxes
so this was a big complicated you know
medical decision
I delegated my penis my penis got it
wrong and that's on me
that's on me
so shoot me
but the people who are correct
use a much better and more rational
decision-making process
they they looked at all the science and
they said to themselves that's not
enough we must use our personal research
and assessment to find out you know what
this really means we've got to look
deeper we've got to look at the not just
the mainstream we've got to look at the
you know the critics we got to look at
the bigger world and I want to be
um
complimentary about this group
because I know I've been harsh in the
past
I want to be very clear
that in order to do good personal
research and assessment of this what
seems like a very complicated area
the people who did this right were not
just experts
they were not just
people who were like data analysts they
were not just doctors they were not just
researchers these were Ordinary People
Blue Collar people
people with every kind of education and
they were fully qualified
every one of them to look at this
complicated stuff that that you know to
me I just couldn't figure out anything I
didn't know which was a bigger risk but
if you did your personal research
and you ignored long covet that was
important you would get the correct
answer
now I like to show both sides of every
argument that always gets me in trouble
so
I'd like to point out that there are
some critics
of this approach
I'm not one of them so don't put this on
me please
right this is clearly the approach that
got the right answer it is rational
and
compare it to the alternatives
what what should I am I going to am I
going to recommend that you stop using
your rational analysis and use your
penis
half of you don't even have one how is
that going to work
you can't make a decision with a vagina
stupid
but you know sometimes the penis gets it
right
but still it's not it's not recommended
right and nobody's going to recommend
you listen to the government inform it
in the news
those are your other choices
so I think you would join me in saying
don't use your
penis or vagina to make a decision don't
listen to the government big Pharma news
because they're professional Liars do a
rational process be you a scientist
data analyst or just somebody who's a
smart person who's doing the work do
your personal research and assessment to
get the correct answer and we see that
they did
they did in fact but it has to be said
there are some critics
there would be some people who would
disagree with this
um
we'll just use some examples of people
who disagree
Isaac Newton
Isaac Newton wouldn't want to see this
because Isaac Newton would say wait a
minute
I invented science
so that you wouldn't do this
because that's what we were doing before
so I invented science because this would
be
sort of adding a subjective layer on top
of the science
so Isaac Newton wouldn't like this
but can we agree that Isaac Newton
he pooped in a hole and he was you know
he was in the 1600s and we don't really
need to listen to an old dead guy all
right so we can discount Isaac Newton I
think what about uh does anybody else
would disagree Carl Sagan Carl Sagan
wouldn't like this at all because he
would like this part but I think he he
would probably have some complaints
about
non-scientists doing their own deep
research he might say
oh Scott that's that's
taking the entire benefit of Science and
discarding it like it didn't count but
Carl Sagan is dead
are you going to listen to a dead guy
I mean how smart is he died anyway
so
well let's talk about uh I saw Jimmy
Dore was talking about my analysis and
he he says that uh not only am I you
know just the Dilbert guy
but he is very annoyed at my arrogance
on this topic
my arrogance
do I say American
I don't say American do I I'm eating I'm
eating humble Crow as hard as I can
I told you you're all right and I got it
wrong I told you I have great regret
because I'm not a pure blood
but Jimmy Dore had some good criticisms
and I'd like to address on his show he
talked quite a bit about me and my
opinions on this
and
uh the first thing when I when I saw the
show I said to myself
wow Jimmy Dore is not doing too well but
you know age catches up with all of us
now I hadn't seen a Jimmy Dore show in a
while and it looked like
he had sort of aged
and when I listened to it I thought oh
God
can somebody stop me before I start
sounding like an old man
who's lost it because somebody you know
I thought somebody needed to talk to him
and I was trying to figure out how old
he was and I thought
just just based on listening to him I
thought um
high 70s
he looked like he's in kind of good
shape you know maybe he takes care of
himself but I thought he's probably 75
76 something like that and you know you
have to I think forgive people for being
a little a little less
quick
when they reached that age
yeah he was he was pretty old so I
looked up his actual age
he's 57.
so that was shocking I thought he I
thought he was closer to 75.
yeah that's what I thought
because you know I'm 65 and I thought
well I'm losing the step
but uh he looked like he lost a lot of
steps you'd have to see it to know what
I'm talking about
but
he also uh he criticized me for calling
the uh the pure Bloods
uh anti-vaxxers and I'd like to clarify
if you will allow me to clarify when I
use the term anti-vaxxer I'm not talking
about all vaccinations
it's always in the context of covet I've
never talked about vaccinations in
general
ever
and in fact a lot of people said Scott
Scott don't throw us into the anti-vaxx
category because we're only concerned
with a the the coveted one
and in fact our kids are vaccinated with
irregular vaccinations but they've been
tested in the normal way
so
um I wasn't aware of this but were you
aware that the normal childhood
vaccinations have been tested
because I thought they weren't
have they been tested childhood
vaccinations
because I thought they would I thought
they were only tested individually
but the way we give them is that
collectively right we give like a
combined shop but that's never been
tested has it the combined shot or did
they only test them individually
they tested some yeah so I don't know
much about the ordinary vaccination
story
but I was unaware that they've tested
them the way they're given I they were
tested individually but I don't think
they were tested the way they're given
you know all at once yeah I think that's
RFK Junior's point I think Trump made
that point as well
so there are a lot of people who are
happy with uh an untested vaccination
for their children but they make a
distinction because the MRNA is unknown
so they they're more comfortable with
the unknown of the combined childhood
vaccination than the unknown of the MRNA
so that seems reasonable
um
and yes and we'll get to some of your
points I see you can go by all right so
the first thing you need to know is that
when I talk about the anti-vaxxers
some are taking that as I was uh
I was making it an insult
but I'm not
to me the anti-vaccineers were the
people that didn't want to take the
coveted vaccine vaccination and got the
right answer
and if I had been talking about all the
other people
I would have included the fact
that there's some question about whether
the childhood vaccinations have been
tested the way they should be tested you
know all together instead of
individually
so I'm not anti I'm not against
anti-vaxxers does that make sense if his
effort sounded like I was
why would I be
it doesn't even make sense that I would
be
all right um
what else did he say oh and then on the
Jimmy Dore show they speculated that the
reason I was so Pro lockdown and
pro-vaccination
according to them not according to
anything I actually did or said but it's
because of my hatred for Trump
I'll just leave that there for a moment
yeah so after they had analyzed me
completely
uh their bottom line was that it could
be the reason I'm so wrong is my hatred
of trump and that that spread over into
me disliking uh my entire audience
so
um but he's only 57. he's Jimmy doors
will be 57 very surprising
all right um
now a lot of you said that the way you
did your analysis and your personal
research and assessment was not just
about the science some of you were good
at that but they were good at not
trusting the people who were withholding
information and making money and all
that but I think that argument
is one I've always agreed with right so
the people who said all the people who
are making the vaccination can't be
trusted the government can't be trusted
nobody can be trusted I was always on
that page I was only questioning the
long covet and
apparently you knew that it wasn't a
problem for me
because it wasn't a problem for young
people
um
no mandatory shots right yeah I've never
been in favor of any mandatory shots
that's for sure
yeah yeah I actually led a anti-mask
uh movement but uh Jimmy Dore knows
better
he knows what I was really thinking and
doing
but anyway
I would like to push back on uh Jimmy's
uh oh and then there are also a number
of people who wanted me to say that when
I said that the the unvaxed people won
that they they want me to clarify that
nobody won
all right so the people who did not give
axed do not want to be labeled as
winners because that would make them
seem small as if you know they didn't
care about the people who were
who were injured but of course they do
care about them and so I won't call it
one I'll just say they were right is
that better
now oh yeah Alex Barrison Alex Berenson
offered to talk to me
to uh to explain to me how he got the
right answer and I didn't
now
uh the last thing I'd like to deal with
is Jimmy Dore
thinks that I'm arrogant
in general I think but on this topic I
would like to defend myself against that
charge
does this look arrogant
does this seem arrogant
now
here's my argument
if I were going to be arrogant
I would act a little differently
well would you mind if I showed you just
like a fictional version of what I would
look like if I were acting arrogant
because then you can contrast it to the
way I am acting so so I like if with
your permission I'm going to model what
it would have looked like had I been
arrogant
okay
you ready this is me doing an impression
of Scott if he were arrogant
well you looked at the science and then
you did your own research
um
some people would say there's a step
missing
[Music]
in which
the psychology
mattered I can't reach it on
I'm strapped into my
unto my
thing here
but some would say that the people who
understand persuasion would know that
this is nothing but confirmation bias
and so the people who said they did this
and then you know trusted their gut
instinct if I were arrogant I would say
well you've just described the exact
reason that science was invented
science was invented
so you wouldn't do this
that was to prevent you from doing this
and this
because these are not science
science is the solution
to doing this this would be the problem
not the solution this would be
everything wrong
according to somebody who understood
psychology
now that would be arrogant
that would be messed up
and that's why I don't do that
instead
I say the people who got the correct
answer it's obvious that they use the
right process and
that's the end of the story and if they
ignore the biggest risk of long covet
it's not because I know how to do things
right
and I include all the risks that would
be arrogant
instead I learned from the people who
got it right and I try to improve my
game
so don't let me be like that because
that would be arrogant
no more arrogance we won't do that
anymore and that ladies and gentlemen
brings me to the end of my program for
YouTube I'm going to talk to the locals
people for a minute
bye for now
