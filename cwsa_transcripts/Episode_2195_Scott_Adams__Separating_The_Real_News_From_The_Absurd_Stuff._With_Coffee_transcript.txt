from
good morning everybody
it's time for coffee with Scott Adams
the greatest thing that's ever happened
a little bit late but you know that's
the way the day is going
if you'd like to take your experience up
to the levels that nobody's ever seen
before all you need is a cup of my girl
glass of tanker chalices die in a
canteen Jugger flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
go
ah
have I ever taught you my trick about
how to use a bad day
does anybody remember that
it is one of the best techniques
you'll ever learn
it goes like this if your day already
sucks
you should do the tasks that you don't
want to do that would ruin your day
so I didn't get enough sleep last night
so I note that I'm in a really crappy
mood
so I'm going to take care of some
 that needed to be taken
care of today
because I have no patience no patience
left whatsoever I'm at the absolute end
of my patience so I'm going to get some
stuff done today
that would be really ugly under normal
circumstances but I'm going to enjoy it
it's the best tip if you need to do some
 and it's really ugly
just match it with a bad day you'll
actually be fine you'll enjoy it
so I'm going to enjoy my day but not
everybody else will
um Maui's on fire
did you ever think about moving to an
island
I think about this all the time I think
you know
I I could work anywhere I could be on an
island and
but every time I think about living on
an island
there's a hurricane or a wildfire or an
alligator attack or something and that
and mentally I can't get past the idea
that I could be on an island in the
middle of the
Pacific or wherever and
and I couldn't get off the island and my
9-1-1 was down that's that's what's
happening in Maui this is Maui right now
they don't have phone service or 9-1-1
and the Island's on fire
I mean in terms of square footage it's
not that much but
all right
I don't know I just I can't uh I can't
convince myself that it's safe to be on
an island more than you know two weeks
which is great
prisoner Island a whole different
situation all right so today's theme
is everything is corrupt everywhere and
everybody's lying
although I feel like that's usually the
theme
it's not that different
um
so
here's some stories on that and we'll
try to figure out which ones are true
and which ones are false all right
so true and false
let me ask you on locals can you really
not tell when I'm already private
do you have do you have no way to tell
you can't tell
all right
do me a favor
after the first two or three times you
tell me that you want me to go private
don't do it anymore
because I just I'm looking at them and
they're just distractions after that I
know you're trying to help
I know you're trying to help but
remember I'm in a bad mood
it's not helping
it's hurting
right it makes me just want to turn it
off
it's the first one fine if it looks like
I didn't see it just let it go just let
it go it's not helping me it's hurting
me okay
um
so the New York Post is reporting that
uh
the bag of cocaine that was found in The
West Wing
belonged to somebody in the Biden family
orbit
and the president apparently knows who
it is all right without reading the
story true or false
does that sound like real news or fake
news
uh without even reading the details of
the story
uh I'm gonna say fake news
yeah if I had to bet on it
I'd say fake news because what does it
mean to be in the Biden family orbit
uh seriously
all right let me get let me take care of
this business right now I told you I I'm
gonna I'm just gonna take care of
everything that that's
uh all right enough of that
um
so yeah that's probably fake news the
the problem is that the Biden family
orbit is too big of a category
don't you think
isn't everybody who goes into the White
House and would be in a if you're in a
uh a non-normal part of the White House
you're going to have some connection to
the Biden family or orbit or something
so I don't know I think that's a that
just doesn't feel real
all right uh Jamie Raskin representative
Democrat
um he's saying that Hunter was trying to
divert money to accounts of family
members but that didn't involve Joe
Is that real news or fake news
that uh that the money coming from
Ukraine and China didn't go into Joe's
accounts it went into family members
yeah that's that's probably technically
true but also intentionally misleading
um
so I'm gonna say that was not true
here's a beauty
how many of you heard this one
that after a Vice President Biden uh
helped pressure the ukrainians to get
rid of the prosecutor
um
I gotta turn this off
uh that the new prosecutor that the
ukrainians got
was somehow connected to the bidens
the next person who got the job had ties
to Hunter Biden
I'm gonna go with true
but be careful about ties too one of the
things the uh the news always does
is they can find a tie to anything do
you know how many times I've been tied
to things
just imagine as a public figure
how many times have I been associated
with
tied to connected with
working with talk to communicated with
one said something too included in a
tweet retweeted
that's what the news does so the news
likes to slime You by association
what are the odds that the high-powered
Hunter Machine
didn't also have connections to lots of
other high-powered people they probably
did but this one seems so suspicious
I'm going to go probably true
anybody agree
probably true there's a there's a tie
now
how important that tie is who knows but
it's certainly alarming probably true
here's a Newsweek headline
by Max Abrams
does Ukraine have compromat compromats
on Joe Biden it's his opinion piece does
Ukraine have compliments in other words
does Ukraine have some black male
material
on Joe Biden
well I read the article to find out the
details of why this would be suggested
and after several minutes of reading the
article talking about Trump I got bored
and never really got to anything about
Joe Biden and compromat I don't know if
it's in the article
I only know it's in the title and I know
I got really really bored before I got
to the part about Biden
so let's judge this without reading it
because I don't think it made any
difference it's just an opinion piece
um
I would always say it's interesting
it's only interesting in the sense that
it's a Newsweek headline
this is a headline in Newsweek
which suggests that at least there's a
worthy question it's a worthy enough
question to be headlined
um I would say
it's probably the most important
question right now
and there's a weird lack of interest in
it what would be more important than
knowing if Ukraine owned the U.S
president in the context of an ongoing
War
what's the second most important thing
after that
you know in terms of questions that we
don't understand the answer to I feel
like that's
yeah right at the top
right at the top and the total lack of
Interest
um have you seen uh CNN or even
I I haven't even seen Fox News
say how do we know there's no blackmail
potential going on there
I suppose there's always blackmail
potential but more than usual in this
case
well we'll see
um
there's a story about the Mitch
McConnell and his wife
Elena ciao
now his wife has connections to a big
Chinese shipping company I think her
father owns it
and there's suggestion that the
McConnells have made money with their
high level connections to China
now this one's a tough one
if you ask me is anything illegal
happening here I would say I'm not aware
of it
but I also heard Devin Archer talk about
Hunter Daniels operation and I couldn't
really tell that anything was illegal
about that
it might be but I mean it's not it's not
obviously drippingly clearly true
it looks like Canada Hunter was probably
smart enough to set up a structure where
there would be some gray area and if you
ever got in trouble he could get out
so is the Mitch McConnell situation one
of those legal but gray areas where
there's you know influence and
connections and probably it did help
some people but is it illegal is it
illegal to know people is it illegal to
give a better deal to somebody that you
know
it will might not be ethical might not
be ideal it might not be what you want
your leaders to be involved in but it
might not be illegal
so I would say this is in the category
of probably true
that the McConnell's benefited
financially
uh but if you're married to if you're if
you're fully disclosed that you're
married to somebody who's got a
disconnection to the Chinese government
I feel like that's about as much
disclosure as you need
because wouldn't you make every
assumption that you needed to make about
his marriage and his connection to China
I mean you would you would just assume
that there's some influence
but it is transparent and it's not
illegal to marry somebody who grew up in
China
so
this was a real weird one
because he's probably legal
probably
but I don't like it right it just it
just raises too many questions and you
know maybe it made sense when he was
operating at the top of his game
but now he's just you know he's turned
to Feinstein fetterman he was just a
zombie walking around there
so I'm not sure it makes sense at the
moment
yeah maybe you were getting enough
benefit from his high level of good work
some would say that you know you you
could ignore that there might be a
connection that's a problem
but if he's completely you know out of
it
and there's a problem
maybe it's time to look for a safer
situation somebody who doesn't have that
connection
so but nothing illegal obviously as far
as I could tell
but I don't like it all right how about
this story most of you saw if you if
you're on Twitter
which I call X
the Gateway pundit reported this
headline and you're going to tell me if
you think it's true or false now we have
proof and it's in capital letters folks
capital letters now we have proof it's a
uh the Gateway pundit exclusive
so the other thing you know need to know
is that the other entities are not
reporting this
massive 2020 voter fraud uncovered
in Michigan including estimated 800 000
ballot applications sent to a non-to
non-qualified voters bags of prepaid
gift cards guns and silencers burner
phones and democrat-funded organization
with multiple temporary facilities in
several States
true or false
is there really obvious and gigantic
voter fraud from 2020 with lots of
details and numbers and it's proved
true or false
is a Fox news reporting it did you see a
big Fox news story on the same story
let's check
let's call it the
Fox News
site
and so this is one of my techniques
if something is got at least got
evidence
Fox News is going to cover it
uh let's see
uh more about their it doesn't look like
it
all right so I'm looking for uh
Michigan 2020
nope
nope nope looks like they don't cover it
so so this would indicate that
um
that Fox News is not convinced because I
think you would agree
since it's not a story about voting
machines it's a story about an
individual
and an organization so if they thought
it was even a little bit true they'd
probably report it don't you think
how about
um Breitbart
breitbarts
what do you think
um actually can somebody look for that
while I'm doing there check Breitbart
see if they're reporting is true
um
I'll tell you one thing about the story
the headline the details in the headline
are not in the body of the story
the 800 000 ballot applications it's in
the headline
it's not in the story now that's what
CNN said when they fact checked it so
Fox News is silent on it
CNN fact checked it and said the story
doesn't even have the headline the
headline in the story don't even match
now do you think the CNN is good as
spotting situations where the story
doesn't match the headline
it's it's basically their business model
how many times have I sat here in
exactly this place and said all right
here's the headline on CNN and it
doesn't match the story it's a very
common thing it's not just CNN by the
way
so all right so I got a confirmation the
story about this alleged proven massive
voter fraud is not even on Breitbart
just not there
so the only one that carried it was
debunking it so CNN mentioned it
debunked it Fox News silent Breitbart
silent
all right so I'll ask this question
again now knowing that the the explosive
details part is not in the body of the
story
what do you say true story or fake story
fake news or real news
I'm going to go with
probably fake
I'll give this uh 80 percent
at least 80 fake
twenty percent who knows anything is
possible now let me be clear
remember my position from the very first
day that the 2020 election got some
questions
from day one I told you that whether or
not there was any fraud
which I had no way of knowing
there would be plenty of reports of
fraud
and that at least at the very least 95
of the reports will be fake the very
least how'd I do
how is my estimate that 95 of the
reports would be untrue and clearly be
easy to prove untrue whereas that says
nothing about whether or not there was
fraught
right so given that I have the smartest
audience in all of politics
I think you guys can handle the fact
that we don't know if there's any fraud
we do know that 95 percent of the the
attacks were unsuccessful
all right
next story uh this one is weird because
I can't tell if it's old or new but
Marjorie Taylor green representative
green says that they've got now more
evidence
or new evidence that the bidens got paid
20 million dollars they've got new bank
statements show money coming from Russia
Kazakhstan and of course Ukraine
and as MTG points out Biden doesn't sell
the Biden's don't sell any kind of
product or service
so that's a pretty sketchy situation now
is anybody having the same issue I am
with this story
I can't tell if this is the same story
that just gets retold every few days
or are they really finding new evidence
of a new and different 20 million
dollars
which is it
a whole new 20 million or the same
millions that they were looking at
before and now they have more evidence
I can't tell
does anybody know the answer to that
if you don't uh somebody says same and
somebody says new there's my point
right so the the claim is that there's
20 million dollars paid from these three
countries and their bank statements to
show it
so summer say noon some are saying it's
new and old so so I think I made my
point
we can't tell when there's a report of
new corruption because there's so much
you know past and existing stories
there's so many fake news stories about
corruption but also probably some real
ones there the field of news became so
dense in the last week that I can't tell
what's true
I don't know is this an old story or a
news story I don't know they all look
the same
I almost feel like it's intentional
because yesterday last night before I
went to bed I was just scrolling through
the news and it all had the same nature
which is there was a big Scandal it was
kind of complicated has something to do
with the bidens I'm not sure if I've
ever seen it before
and I was just flooded with him until I
was losing my sense
of what had already been debunked
what was new
what was old and what was important
there's so much of it that all of it
seemed unimportant in my brain
does anybody have that feeling
if you had one like really powerful
story about the bidens and only one
your brain would say well that's
important and every time somebody
brought up Biden you'd say well but that
one thing
that one thing is really big looks like
it's true
but there are now so many
varied stories about Biden bad behavior
you know in some Biden family member or
Biden that I'm not even sure I can sort
them out anymore my brain has decided
that they can't be important
even though my rational brain says of
course they are and not only are they
important there's a lot of stuff that
looks important there
but my brain can't handle it so my brain
is saying oh blah blah blah Biden every
day that's all I need to know there's
people saying blah blah blah blah and
then my brain says it's too much to
think about
so I think I'll just think about my own
day I won't think about that
are you having anything like that that
feeling
now maybe I get more of it because I'm
actually looking for the headlines and
looking for patterns and stuff but I
feel overwhelmed
by the quantity of accusations such that
none of them seem important in my mind
and I want to be very clear about this
nuance
my rational brain my rational brain
knows it's critically important
critically critically important I mean
maybe the most important thing that's
happening you don't even know if the
Ukraine war is legitimate in the sense
that somebody thought it was a good idea
it might just be a cover-up it could be
I mean these are really really big
questions but they're so big and so many
that I'm going to forget about them as
soon as we're done here if I didn't have
them written down
I couldn't even list them in an hour
because just too much my brain's full I
don't know if this is intentional do you
is it just because it's the political
season just a coincidence or is it some
kind of op like are we being played
somehow to be just exhausted on on all
these charges until they don't seem
important
I don't know just a question
here's another one
um Michael schellenberger is following
up we already knew the White House was
pressuring Facebook to censor the
vaccine Skeptics
but apparently they had several ways
they did it they'd uh there was
something that needed to be negotiated
with Europe that Facebook needed so they
it was vitally important that they made
the government happy Facebook was
thought they might be retaliated against
that's bad then they have that what is
it the rule 230 protection
that the government could rescind so
that's always an implied threat over the
social platforms
but the newest report is that the White
House was under pressure from
and just
see if you're outraged mind has any room
for this
right your brain is full of outrage see
if there's even room for it
the White House was under pressure from
the news media
that's the report
that the New York Times and maybe others
were pressuring Facebook
to the sensor
now I don't know how much that pressure
mattered
so but when I hear it like my head wants
to explode but there are so many things
in my head that makes it want to explode
I've discounted them all including this
one
in an hour I will remember this
I will not remember the story in an hour
but it looks like it's kind of important
I don't know if it's you know if there's
any details I don't know about it but
it's too much
all right here's one
Portland jury finds antifa militants not
libel in the Andy no attack
now
I wasn't on the jury
but haven't we seen videos that clearly
show these people attacking us
am I imagining that
did I imagine it was clearly on video
and there's no question about who the
individuals were and there doesn't seem
to be any question about what they did
does this look like jury nullification
to you
kind of does doesn't it it looks like
the jury just decided to ignore the law
do you know that the defense attorney uh
proudly said she was a member of antifa
how many of the people the jury were
sympathetic to antifa or thought they
they would be hurt if they didn't vote a
certain way
how many of them were just afraid of the
defendants or the defendants
organizations no no but we do know it
doesn't look like the justice system
works
I would say our justice system is just
fundamentally broken at this point from
top to bottom from presidents to
Andy now it looks like it's broken from
top to bottom
I hate to say that
but the evidence is
sort of mounting
all right um
there's a
Democrat politician in D.C
uh uh a young black man who looked
looked pretty it looked pretty sharp I'd
have to say I'm going to give him a
gonna give him a good grades for uh
doing what he's doing which is uh Treyon
white is his name
and he's calling on the National Guard
to help address the rampant of violent
crime in the nation's capital now I
don't know if there's anything else this
D.C councilman has done that you don't
like so you know don't jump on me if
there's some other thing in this past
that you don't like I don't know that
there is but
I love the fact that he lives there
and he says it's an emergency and we
gotta treat it like an emergency
I like it but it also tells you that you
know the defunding the police and the
prosecutors they're too liberal to know
that have destroyed D.C
I mean didn't didn't Trump say it's
turned into a basically a garbage pit
so is DC the only city that's dying
no San Francisco reports that Nordstrom
is closed their two locations yet Target
is locked up all their products Whole
Foods getting into town
um
so uh
X might be the only company left after a
while but I would add this to the story
I think the story might be a little
alarmist in the sense that Nordstrom
closed in my town a long time ago
so you know I live in a high-end suburb
of San Francisco
and uh our Nordstrom went out of
business
I know a year ago
and I think this is more to do with
retail
I think Nordstrom just wasn't
supportable and I think that Target
uh Target needs to be an online company
why do you go into the store to buy
anything at Target
well like what would even be the purpose
of going into a store
unless you had to pay cash I guess
but uh so maybe it's because of San
Francisco and the crime but maybe these
businesses were not viable anyway I
don't I don't think I don't think
Nordstrom was viable in the long run but
of course the Looting had to take a toll
all right there was a big electric bus
company that was going to be change in
the world and saving us from climate
change I guess and it was attempted by
Kamala Harris and Biden and now they're
in a business and
some are saying it was a pump and numb
scheme and was never real and all the
top Democrats were involved and money's
missing and it was basically every
accusation you imagine but the other
possibility is
startups go out of business
what do you think do you think that this
bus company was always just a play
it was just a scam from the start or do
you think it was a startup and it just
didn't work out
don't know
don't know my my guess yeah there you go
my guess is both
because if you've been involved with any
kind of a business startup
there is always that scammy phase
there's that phase where you know the
the startup is is wondering well we
can't exactly do what we claimed
but I'm pretty sure we can if we get a
little bit more money we're like really
close
so I feel like the the distinction
between scam and optimism
is actually too overlapping to to call
it out
if we didn't have people over promising
and saying they can do things they can't
do
we wouldn't do nearly as many things as
we do
so while you don't like it when people
lie to you
it does kind of drive the economy
you know the the optimism is what formed
the company brought in money the
optimism is what caused them to pay
their vendors and think they were in
business so it did create a bunch of
Economic Opportunity
even in failing
so we weirdly we have an economy that is
mostly failure and it works fine because
most companies go out of business most
eventually so it's a big old failure
driven economy and because of the free
market it works you don't need too many
things to succeed big before the average
looks pretty good so I don't know I I
guess I wouldn't assume corruption here
except that we live in a world where
everything seems to be corrupt at the
moment
uh zubi you I'm sure you all follow
zooby on x
he uh tweeted but I call it posting
because it's not really Twitter uh that
what were those other 80 of Twitter
staff doing
do you remember when all the smart
Democrats said that uh musk was he must
have been just the worst manager
I mean musk must have made such a big
management mistake to get rid of 80
percent of his staff because how could a
company possibly function without 80 of
its people suddenly
turns out the answer is it can innovate
faster
am I right is the Innovation at Twitter
greater or less
what would you say
I believe I've seen more changes on
Twitter now X than any time in the past
it was the greatest Innovative search
do you know why
there was a great Innovative surge
well several reasons you know Elon of
course is a driver of innovation so
that's automatic
um but I think that getting rid of 80
percent of the staff was a big big part
of what could make Twitter or X innovate
faster
hey have you ever worked at a big
company
here's a big company
engineer comes in makes presentation to
the boss boss says why don't you
socialize that with marketing and sales
and you know five other departments talk
talk to the lawyers and then you do that
and what happens
every one of those entities tells you
you can't do it and they have a
different reason well that's probably a
legal problem
well we can't Market that well we can't
sell that well we're busy with other
things well the budget the budget isn't
there for that well you'd better you
know submit your budget with all the
others so basically eighty percent would
create a bureaucracy that would limit
the effectiveness of the 20 who do the
real work that's every big company
now I suppose you you insert an Elon
Musk into the thing and Elon says if
you've got a big important question
ask me
now I'm just imagining that's probably
what happens now now you're the engineer
you come up with your good idea the old
way is you have to satisfy the other 80
of the staff that are already gone
and that wasn't going to work by the way
I've been in this situation exactly a
number of times I can tell you the other
parts of the company are only there to
stop you from doing what you want to do
they're only there to stop you
so now you take that same idea that all
of those organizations would have said
no or later or get in line to and you're
taking the Elon you say this is a great
idea you've got some risk but what do
you think
now what does Elon say oh you better
check with marketing that doesn't even
said no he says yeah let's try that if
it doesn't work we'll reverse it
right just try it if it doesn't work
we'll say we tried it didn't work and
then we'll turn it back to the way it
was
which he's actually done a few times I
believe
now compare that level of efficiency
where you get to talk to not only one of
the smartest business people in the
world
but he gives you an answer right while
you're talking to him and then you go
off and do it
there's no way that old Twitter could
have competed with a model where the
engineer can talk to the smartest
business person in the world and get an
answer and then go off and implement
like that that probably just doesn't
exist almost anywhere except at X
so that's uh Elon for the win on that uh
ESG continues to die
so there's a group called s p Global
they used to give out scores ESG scores
and they've decided uh their debt rating
agency but in addition to the debt
rating they would give these ESG scores
and they decided not to do it anymore
because it was
that's right
a big ratings agency one of the main
ones that rated you for ESG decided it
was all and they're not going
to do it anymore it's just not part of
their business now
now they didn't use the word
but did they need to
I I think the the essence of it was the
ESG rating was not correlating to
Performance
or anything useful
just wasn't correlated with anything and
the the scores seem to be maybe
political or stupid or I don't know
subjective or something so the whole
thing just seemed stupid I guess and
they decided not to be part of it
well let's look on the other side of
that Best Buy is implementing a
management program training program that
is not available to white people
and says so in direct writing yeah you
can apply for this if you're you know
this this is this but white people not
on the list
um
it took about a minute and a half before
somebody tweeted me that a picture of
the CEO
who is a woman a woman so Best Buy is
run by a woman
and uh they implemented a no no white
people program for management
um if you're a white person would you
ever shop at Best Buy again
if you could avoid it I won't
I'm not going to shop there again I'm
totally done with them because there's
nothing I don't believe Best Buy has a
single thing I can't buy somewhere else
can you think of anything name one thing
I can't order from Amazon
I can't think of anything
so does Amazon have a program where they
exclude white people
do that
do you think Jeff Bezos has a program
that excludes white people
I don't know
but I'd put a somebody says yes maybe
but I haven't heard about it so
um yeah
they're dead to me I would I would avoid
them like the plague
and you you there has to be a penalty
for this am I right
I'm completely against boycotts for sort
of ordinary political reasons but this
isn't an ordinary political reason this
is straight up racism
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna give my
money to a company this overtly racist
against me
like why would I do that well under what
circumstance would I ever give them
money again
well if they fire their CEO and reverse
and reverse the program I will be there
tomorrow
so Best Buy if you want my money
um
it's available
but you could have to fire your CEO and
you're gonna have to get rid of this
program that would be my minimum
requirement
not that you need to do anything for me
but I don't need to do anything for you
as well so we could agree agree on that
well Trump made what I would consider
a rare campaign mistake
um say what you will about Trump's you
know management of the country
but as a campaigner most people agree
that
he's sort of in a category of his own
he can get attention and he can move the
needle leak and persuade I mean he's got
the whole set of tools but here's one
you're not going to agree with me until
I give you my reasons and you will all
agree with me immediately
so he quite humorously made fun of Chris
Christie's weight at a rally
so what he he said I'm not going to call
him a fat slob or something fat pig fat
pig so he was pretending like somebody
in the audience said it and he was
pointing to the audience member but we
don't know if anybody really was in the
audience saying that he might have been
just acting it out but he did the I'm
not going to say it yeah but you're
saying he's a fat pig I'm not going to
say it
um
all right here's my here's my take
number one
was it funny
answer was it funny
absolutely yeah a lot of well people
left so if you say no
it means it wasn't funny to you
which is valid because it's subjective
right so humor is not objective so those
of you saying it was funny you're right
those of you who say it wasn't funny
you're right too
because there's no standard for funny if
it was funny to you it's funny if it's
not funny to you it's not funny that's
the whole story
however strategically
you should never say something if you're
running for office
that would have the following quality
nobody is going to vote for you because
of it
but some people
might change their vote because of it
two-thirds
of Trump's voters are overweight
two-thirds
two-thirds of Trump's voters are pretty
overweight
and he just made fun of being overweight
in public
now others would point out that he's got
a weight problem to his own I get it I
get it but that's not going to be really
where people focus
so I'm going to teach you something that
I learned as a Cartoonist
I would often think you know here's a
joke that's really my my audience is
gonna love this joke it is a little mean
to some group and because I used to make
fun of people who had extra weight
I've changed that opinion because I
don't believe in Free Will and I don't
believe that people
uh
are overweight by choice I think it's
just their brain can't handle sugar
basically I think that's basically the
whole thing so I can maintain my weight
fairly well
because I don't love sugar
I just I'm just not addicted to it if I
were I'd weigh 400 pounds and I wouldn't
hate myself I just say I just I'm
addicted what can I do
so I don't do fast shaming but here's
what I learned never do a joke that 99
of the people will love if one percent
will stop following you
that never makes sense and this is a
this is probably a 95 to 5 situation
I would bet you five percent of the
people who are the news about Trump
making fun of Christie's weight just
said to themselves
I did like you and I was gonna I was
gonna get up and I was gonna vote for
you I still kind of like your politics
but you know what
I'm gonna eat breakfast instead of
voting
the I would say that this is uh clearly
a mistake
because there's would you agree with the
following statement zero people decided
to vote for Trump because he mocked
somebody for their weight do you agree
with that part just the first part that
he gained no new voters
agree now would you agree with the
second part that there might be some
sliver of people
who were turned off Enough by that
because it's personal it's very personal
very personal let me let me give you uh
my take of it if he had my if he had
made fun of
some other immutable characteristic and
I happen to have it I wouldn't be too
happy about it
I I wouldn't say well it was really
funny
I'd probably say you know I think I need
somebody with better judgment and I
would talk myself out of it
yeah weight weight is not immutable
unless you believe uh weight is not
immutable if you believe in free will
so if you believe in Superstition it's
not immutable if you believe that Free
Will is an illusion then whatever nature
your brain is guarantees that you will
act a certain way
and mine's luckily
luckily my brain seems to be different
so I'm not attracted to massive eating
but I could easily imagine I would be
right it's easy to imagine
Scott you sound a bit too PC
really
now
um
PC would
my entire opinion is based on science
right
I don't even think it's his opinion
and math
so the the math of it is that you don't
gain anybody but you might lose somebody
there's no there's no part of my opinion
in that
which part of that is an opinion that's
just math and it's obvious and it's
observable
all right now the part where I'm not
giving people a hard time for weight
is because I don't believe in Free Will
which is longer longer discussion
but it's not it's not based on PC it's
based on science either there's free
will or there's not if science showed me
there is free will
then I would change my opinion is that
PC or is that just kind of going where
the the argument seems to go
all right that's such a NPC comment to
say that somebody's like to this or to
that
sometimes we have a variety of opinions
well Bill Maher continues to make news
almost every single day at least in the
political right for bashing the team
that you imagined he used to be on Riz
on there for being too woke
but I guess on his uh
his uh what's it called uh his little
podcast where he talks to one person
what's that called Bill Mars Club random
um on Club Brandon we had Riley Gaines
the woman who competed against Leah
Thomas
and finally
all all the news there's been about Leah
Thomas all the news about Riley Gaines I
mean at least if you're following right
leading news it's just been the news
continuously and it took all of that for
Bill Maher to ask the only question I
was actually interested in
which is how big is Leah Thomas's dick
now
under normal conditions that question
would not have a news related
element it would just be kind of
gratuitous
but part of the complaint and here here
I'm going to describe the complaint
if you imagine I'm taking sides then
you're probably imagining it I'm just
describing it right these are people's
opinions and they get to have their
opinions
so the women who are in the changing
room with trans athlete Leah Thomas
said the report is that many of them
were uncomfortable because Leah Thomas
is what they would say an intact male
body
meaning that there's a penis there
now if you were a woman and you were
uncomfortable with that situation
completely normal and understandable
would it matter to you
how big the penis is
because it was actually part of the
story I think it was Riley Gaines who
was saying that Leah Thomas was
six foot four
and proportional
so impressive I guess
and uh I actually think it's part of the
story
does anybody disagree
because the story is about how people
feel
it's a story about how people feel
you don't think that the the women would
feel different
if Leah had a micro penis
versus a big old
sausage you don't think it makes a
difference how people feel about it yeah
now logically you know that shouldn't
you shouldn't be making any laws based
on the size of a penis
so you know there's nothing you can do
about it but I think it's actually a
legitimate question so weirdly I'm just
going to give Bill Maher credit for
asking a actually useful
a question that tells us a little bit
more about the situation
now again
did I did I express an opinion did
anybody hear an opinion in that
because I was trying to do it without an
opinion coming through
because my take on all this is that
my opinion should be worthless
it's clearly bad for the the women who
are competing against the trans athletes
nobody nobody's questioning that
it is clearly good for the trans
athletes who are benefiting from this
access so you've got one group that's
benefited one group that feels injured
and they both they both have their
arguments they live in a few free
country they get to you know press the
arguments these things get settled by
power
so to imagine that you know the argument
about what's right or wrong coming from
me
should have any weight on this
I think not I think that women as a
group
are going to collectively reverse this
and I correct me if I'm wrong but
haven't there been a number of notable
reverses
are the women not winning at this point
because it seems to me that I've heard
more about trans athletes being banned
lately just last few weeks then being
included
am I wrong about that haven't there been
some high-level bands but not any new
high-level new access
so I so to me it looks like a a power
struggle
which both sides always put in terms of
what's right or wrong
um I don't feel like I'm the judge of
what's right or wrong
I can tell you that there's a victim in
this case or a victim in that case but
since there's always something that's
imperfect
this is my job to tell you what should
and should not be I don't know I did see
there was what league was it
uh
if you if you want the the real person
answer the real person if it were my
daughter
I would back my daughter
are you okay with that
if it were my daughter of course I'd say
get that get that Leah Thompson or Leah
Thomas out of there I would just say if
it's bothering my daughter I don't like
it
would be as simple as that so don't
worry that I don't have opinions
I was just trying to tell the story
without it because I don't think my
opinion should be in the story I feel
like I don't add anything
right
if you put me in the story I could very
easily have an opinion but I'm not in
the story
all right
I was I was questioning whether I was
going to talk about this but I've
decided to do it
I saw a
Mike cernovich tweet about Sam Harris
and included a clip in which he was
talking about Trump in January 6 and the
insurrection
I guess he imagined he saw and sort of
it's asked this
and I spent a long time deciding whether
I'd retweet it
or whether it was too far like is this
unfair
and here's what you decide
so this is Mike Sturtevant she said is
Sam Harris in early stage of dementia
did he have a concussion or maybe his
alcoholism caught up with him what and
then Mike says anyone familiar with
alcoholics sees the red flags here
so I look so I watched the video and I
thought to myself really
am I going to see that in the video
and
here's the problem if you're primed for
it you can definitely see it
but don't let that influence you if
you're primed for it as in you just read
the tweet and then you listen to them
you can very easily tell yourself wait a
minute there is something wrong
right but don't let that fool you
because that's because of the priming
right so I do not make I do not make the
accusation
so I'm I'm removing myself from the
accusation
however
is it an unfair question
is it unfair if somebody acts in a way
that should be identified with maybe not
reason but some other mechanism
is it unfair to call that out
that's why that's why I couldn't decide
whether to tweet it
because subjectively and in my biased
way because I was very biased by the
Tweet itself
I felt like I could see it
and
when I listen to him talk I thought to
myself
You couldn't possibly be that smart
and think that there was not a orderly
transfer of power on January 6. or a
peaceful transfer there was in fact
I mean the worst case scenario the
biggest risk is it might have been you
know a few days later
there was never any risk of a non uh of
a uh
non or there's never any risk that it
wouldn't be a largely peaceful transfer
of power like every other time
but he seems to be in this world in
which that was a real thing
and so the question is am I crazy
and could I rule it out no so I cannot
rule out that he's the only sane person
in the world
you can't rule it out
Sam Harris might be the only one who
makes sense and all the rest of us are
in weird bias
situation totally possible which is
weird but if you don't acknowledge that
that's possible
you you'll get in trouble later maybe
this time it's about Sam maybe next time
it's about us I don't know we're not
going to know the difference
but
um so I'm not I'm not going to back
the the speculations about his mental
decline but I'll tell you I see it
my impression and from what I can tell
from other people online it looks like
mental decline it does actually look
like it I wouldn't put it on any one
cause if I if I had to gun to head if I
had to put a cause I would just say
standard Trump derangement syndrome
it's just that he got more more
attention about his Trump opinions than
other people so in theory
you know if you were an independent
thinker and you got a lot of pushback on
something you thought was a good take
you probably triple down
because you were confident you had the
right take on it so it would look to us
like mental decline it would look like
he's drunk it would actually look like
he's drunk and it does
but it could be
the things you can't rule out or just
standard Trump derangement syndrome
because it affects everybody at every
intelligence level intelligence won't
help you a bit and
uh it could be that you're the you and I
are the ones with the problems maybe
he's not the one with the problem maybe
he's the only one with the right take
absolutely possible can't be ruled out
all right
uh DeSantis
he was tweeting that today drug cartels
are responsible for killing more
Americans than any other group or
country yet we sit back and do nothing
all right all right DeSantis you're
talking my language now let's see what
else you got here as president all right
here it comes I will authorize use of
deadly force I like it against drug
smugglers yes yes cutting through the
border wall
what
deadly force against drug smugglers
cutting through the border wall
that's it
that's it
the biggest problem in the United States
and he's only going to use Force against
the ones he catches cutting through the
wall
just the cutters
this is so weak
that it's embarrassing
it's actually embarrassing
what what's wrong with him
what is wrong with DeSantis
I don't understand this because here's
let me give you a hypothesis all right I
have a hypothesis
you might remember that let's say a year
ago
every time this answers made news as a
governor I said something that sounded
the same every time oh my God that's a
good idea oh my God he's good at getting
the headlines in a productive way oh my
God it's like one right move after
another for his base right you could
argue whether there are good moves or
bad but politically and for his base
they were all genius they're they were
just right on right on right on every
time
now
he moves from Governor making one
political home run after another for his
base right the others don't like it and
then he moves into the campaign
and it feels like he lost all that magic
now do you think that one person can go
from you know the governor domain to the
presidential domain and lose their skill
how do you lose your skill
just changing that domain I don't think
the presidential race is that different
because in both cases you say things
that your base would like
and you try to say it first or best you
try to do something about it it's all
the same game politically but why did he
suddenly become bad at it when he was
not just only good
he was about the best I've ever seen I
mean he was crazy
what would be a good hypothesis for that
change and don't say alcoholism or Trump
derangement syndrome
uh there you go Q staff exit my
hypothesis is this
whoever was advising him in the
governor's race
was way above average
way above average as in you haven't even
seen that kind of operation before
I have some suspicions who it might have
been
because there aren't that many people in
the country who are that capable and I'm
not going to tell you because I don't
have any proof I have no proof at all so
based just on the capability
there's probably one person
and I'm not going to tell you ever who
it is but there is one person who has
that capability
who could have been advising him in the
governorship
and would have quite potentially
switched to Trump
so no not not geldini not nothing to do
with um a nothing to do with any uh
academics right nothing with an academic
but uh does anybody see that same effect
no Matt Gates would have been Trump from
the start
that gase was always pro-trump so that's
not a case of him leaving and going
anywhere but does anybody see that the
the skill level just fell off
as if a major as if a major advisor like
the best one
switched
doesn't it seem like that
that's what I think
so now this is pure speculation it's
just based on observation of the skill
level dropping off suddenly I feel like
that was
had to be a key advisor
yeah
all right
oh you think he's playing to the donors
instead of the base
now it doesn't look like that to me it
looks like a capability falloff
all right
um how about the Ukraine
counter-offensive huh
Ukraine counter-offensive it's just
tearing up the Russian lines uh getting
a little quiet about that aren't they
can we stop pretending there's a war
because there isn't a war
it is a negotiation
and it's waiting for Trump
if you see it any other way what
evidence would there be to support your
point
how do you support your point if you
think this is a war because you think
Ukraine is going to break down the
Russian lines and defeat the Russian
army and Putin's gonna surrender
or you think the Russians have only been
joking around and as soon as they go as
soon as they get serious they're going
to run through those Ukrainian lines and
take Kiev
no that's all ridiculous
it's ridiculous the situation there is
only for the benefit of people selling
you know arms and other Goods
and it's just a holding pattern
we're just waiting for Trump
and nothing should change this situation
because the Democrats apparently are
benefiting from it
there's somebody making money a lot of
money you know the money that's going to
Ukraine isn't all going into bullets
right a lot of it's being siphoned off
because it always is that's an easy easy
statement to say
so you got the Democrats and they're
siphoning off group they don't want to
wrap up the war
and you got
you you've got the Russians that can't
possibly end the war because it would
look like a defeat
so there isn't anything there's nothing
happening that could change this from a
bloody negotiation into an actual War
this is not a war
the war is over
right and every time that the the news
refuses to report that the war has been
over for a while
it's bloody
but it's a negotiation
now you could you could get you know
real conceptual and say every war is a
negotiation but no it isn't
no it isn't not like this this is pure
negotiation this is not a little bit of
War
this is just a negotiation because there
is no reasonable chance that the
situation is going to change before
Trump gets in office
that's my take what do you think
is my take useful and or
so if we reframe this as a negotiation
that's our best situation the U.S should
reframe it as a negotiation
which also is very positive for a
republican candidate
am I right because I don't hear I don't
hear the Democrats saying hey let's
negotiate this war have you heard any
maybe some have but Biden doesn't talk
like that does he when it was last time
Biden said negotiate
I don't believe I've heard that
so the Democrats aren't even on that
wavelength so if you if you define it as
a negotiation
then you can see the mismatch between
the Biden you know unwilling to even
consider that and several I think
several Republicans
do me a fact check on this aren't there
several Republicans besides Trump
ramaswamy uh who are saying they can
wrap this up pretty quickly
within negotiation
am I am I wrong that so so Trump and
Vivek
give me a fact check of this they're
both clear
about we'll wind this down right away
this is a negotiation
I think so there might be other
um did RFK say the same
I think RFK Jr is pretty close to that
as well yeah
yeah
it looks like Russia will keep some of
that territory I don't see any way
around it all right ladies and gentlemen
is there any topic I have not covered
um
uh Marin County armed car break-in I
haven't seen that
so I don't know what's going in on in
Niger I guess the rebels have taken over
but since I have no opinion about
whether the rebels are better or worse
than the government they took over
I don't have an opinion on Niger
and I don't believe it's the sort of
thing
where I would ever get a good opinion
it sounds like something we'll never
know
all right
um Victoria Newlin you know I've I've
been avoiding the Victoria Newland stuff
because there's a whole lot of mind
reading you have to do
somebody's disagreeing with me sorry
Scott it's a bloody stalemate Russia
doesn't want to escalate to Nato
involvement and recruiting seems to me
um
a bloody stalemate is that disagreeing
with me so when you agree with me
completely this is just a writing tip
don't start it with sorry Scott
right when you're completely agreeing
uh better that would be better left for
when there's a disagreement that follows
the sorry Scott
but when you're agreeing with me
completely maybe yes Scott
do that yes Scott
and then agree with me it's just better
form
um
uh the Alabama fight all right
so there's a big fight on the dock in
Alabama I don't care why do I care about
that
you're you're trying to make me care
because there were black participants in
the fight in the state I don't live in
I don't care
what why is that news
so people got in the fight apparently
there was a reason for the fight
something about a you know a boat dock
or something dispute but why do we care
about that why is that news
right be be careful of trying to make
news the anecdotes you know take take
Vivek as your guide
Vivek said on an interview recently you
would mock us if we used anecdotes for
science
don't use your anecdotes about a fight
to make some policy decision it was a
fight
no big deal
all right
um and may I suggest
that if you lived near a place where
such fights might break out
you should consider relocating
I feel like location is 80 of success
what is this looking at this uh a
pedophile shot and killed two FBI agents
haven't seen this covered at all
yeah because I don't care
I don't care there are some things that
are not covered
because we don't care
now I'm not saying I don't care about
the tragic deaths of two Law Officers of
course of course I care but you know a
million people died yesterday I'm not
I'm not doing a awake for all of them
so
a pedophile who shoots some FBI people
that sounds like a horrible tragic thing
but it's not really a story in the
country is it
is there any bigger message there I
don't think so bad person shot some good
people
that's the story
all right
um I'm seeing prods I'm being prompted
to talk about black on black crime why
why would I talk about that
I would get away from it if you live
near it you should move
that's the only thing I'm going to say
about it because if you haven't figured
out what are you going to do about it
what are you going to do about black on
black crime the Democrats want fewer
police
let them live in the city the way that
they want to if they'd like to live in a
city under those conditions
it's a free country
and you know I here's what I think I
think we should take all of our
attention that we're putting on you know
the average of this group versus this
group oh this group has bad stats
forget about all of that
forget about all of it and just create a
system that allows everybody to move
easily
if you lived in an inner city and it was
full of crime doesn't matter what your
color ethnicity is
you might want to get out of there but
it might not be easy because if you're
in an inner city there's there's a
reason and it may be that you know
there's no jobs you don't know where to
go you wouldn't be comfortable someplace
else Etc I feel like
the best thing you could do is create a
way that people who just want to stay
out of trouble and go to school
that those families can be moved out of
any environment that would stop that
from happening
but once you move the good people who
want to succeed from the bad people who
want to be criminals
if you're not going to arrest the
criminals you just have to get out of
there you just have to get away
Rogan said that Obama is the greatest
president I'd have to see the context of
that
um
would we be able to oh so what's the
latest on LK 99 I saw some mocking
references to it as if it's been proven
not to be real did that happen
because I was sort of looking for the
story and couldn't find it
lots of uncertainty
so at the the current feeling of
superconductivity is not real
is it leading not real
damn it
yeah you could feel it couldn't you
you know I I went at this with maximum
optimism because I I just like to be
optimistic you know whenever you have a
chance
yeah rather than worrying about bad
things that never happened
I'd rather talk about good things that
aren't going to happen
at least your you know your brain is
with the good slings
so well who's surprised
is anybody surprised
I thought it went further than it should
have before
before the questions were raised
yeah strange magnetic properties are
they useful are the strange magnetic
properties useful for anything
is it some other kind of
potentially
all right well I'm going to be
completely uh I'm going to go negative
on LK 99.
so I'm going to adjust my current
thinking just based on this to probably
not
probably not
which is very disappointing because I
had
add some optimism there
all right what else am I missing
anything else yeah so it means cold
fusion won't be so easy
Etc
um if you report about leotards to to
hear about yours as well
all right
pedophile is a thought crime not if they
do it
it's the zero resistance
but does it have zero resistance
is it not super conductive but has zero
resistance I think that's not possible
Right
yeah
am I positive or negative about
magnetism good one dad joke
it has small resistance does have less
resistance than normal
maybe that would be useful I don't know
uh frictionless is possible somebody
says
you know I would say that my journey
into denying reality started with
magnets
when I was a little kid I could not
understand how a magnet could be
possible
and it was the first thing that
suggested that I don't understand
reality itself like you know what what
I'm looking at right in front of me
may not be real
now that's my current view as as a older
adult but I think it was the weirdness
of magnets
that made me lose all trust that what
I'm seeing could be understood by my
brain
whatever magnets are doing
your brain is not capable of
understanding it likewise with gravity
so gravity is folded or bent in space
and time is not real but space time is
how does your brain handle that and
non-locality you know spooky action at a
distance how's your brain handle that
the only way my brain can understand
those things
wrong just study Physics uh I I'm going
to challenge you on that somebody said
wrong just study Physics
and once you study Physics then then all
these spooky things are explained right
now if you believe that
you've really been brainwashed physics
replaces understanding with words and
formulas
sometimes those words and formulas work
in the sense that they're predictive and
they're useful but there's nothing like
understanding of physics
physics is 100 not understood
a hundred percent
there's not even one percent understood
they only know what works
that's it
and they only know that because they can
repeat it
that's it there's no there's nothing
like
understanding of physics
do you believe there is
just because somebody can put words
around it right let me let me prove to
you that I'm as smart as Einstein watch
watch
there's no time there's only space time
and gravity is really about the bent
space
how about that
there I put words on physics so
therefore I understand physics right as
well as Einstein he used the same words
oh I'll do it again watch this
E equals m c squared boom boom
I know that those letters when you put
an equal
and then you put things on either side I
know how to pronounce it
so therefore I understand some Physics
no nobody understands any physics
but they do know sometimes what works
and what doesn't
that's all they know
we don't know the why of anything
all of the why questions are sort of
imaginary
all right
um
what would Define understanding
well
um that's a good question but let me
answer it indirectly because it's the
best I can do
what are the odds that your brain
evolved to understand reality
so it's not it's not that there's
something to understand and your brain
isn't keeping up I think that your brain
was never meant to give you a picture of
reality in the first place
so your question is sort of like
um
why can't a toothbrush be a rocket ship
or something
it's like
it's not meant for that
you know I don't I could give you a long
explanation of why you know an astronaut
would not fit inside a toothbrush
or I could just say it's the wrong
question
I don't need to get into the details
all right
um
that is not physics
boy if there's one thing you can
guarantee that the people who who are
under the illusion that they understand
physics
they will be quite quite prickly when I
tell them that they don't
all right that's all I have for now I'm
going to talk to you later I'm going to
see what's what and I will talk to you
tomorrow YouTube thanks for joining
