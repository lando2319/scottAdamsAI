oh
well well well
good morning everybody
and you'd be as happy as i am right now
if you had just seen a meme of joe
biden's dog
i'm not even gonna describe it
just suffice to say
that if you get a chance to google a
meme
that's probably labeled something like
joe biden's dog you've gotta
[Laughter]
oh my goodness what a day
oh so
all right i'll just show it to you
uh so over on the on the locals platform
the commenters can put in images as well
so you can't see this on youtube but
here you go
here's a
joe biden's dog
[Laughter]
i don't know why that's so funny but it
is
yeah i usually don't like jokes like
that i don't i don't like bathroom humor
but when it's done
no one they're funny they're funny
all right how would you like to take it
up a notch
and i know you would and all you need is
a copper mug or a glass a tanker chelsea
stein a can't eat jug or flask a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day i think makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip it's
going to happen now and watch what it
does for your antibodies watch this
go
yeah you can feel it can't you you're
getting healthier right now
now i know there's a lot of talk about
whether you'll need a booster
because the coffee the coffee will
protect you for a while
but like most good things it wears off
every three months you need another
simultaneous sip i recommend daily
yeah i recommend daily but the minimum
is once every three months you need a
booster
just like the vaccination all right
let's get my comments back here i lost
them there we go
all right i don't even know where to
start
are you following the ashley biden's
diary story
ashley biden's diary
now
we don't know what's true yet right
we're in the fog of war stage but the
things that we think we know are true is
that allegedly there's an ashley biden
diary that somebody stole
and they ended up allegedly in the
possession of
project veritas
now the fbi apparently has raided
people associated with project veritas
to try to get back
the ashley biden's diary which we don't
know is real or not
that's right the fbi raided to get back
a diary
that we the public don't know if it's
real a real diary or not
what do you think
what do you think
well i think if the fbi goes to raid to
get it back
it's probably a real diary
probably a real diary
now among the things in this alleged
diary
uh
and i believe have you all seen it am i
just telling you something you've
already seen or is there somebody here
who doesn't know this story yet
all right
well
i'm going to tell you some tidbits from
it
that
again
it's allegedly real
and the fbi allegedly raided to
allegedly get it
so you know it's leaning toward it might
be real
ashley asks can you tell us about the
ashley
the ashley
thing yes well
here's what it says among other things
so she's got some uh
she has some let's say
suspicions about her own life that she
may have been sexually abused by
somebody she's not she's not saying her
father
but that she may have had some sexual
abuse that's repressed or something
now
that part sounds pretty sketchy
but she also alleges that she took
showers with her father
until she was inappropriately old she
thinks
inappropriately old for taking a shower
with your father
now she doesn't mention what age that is
well
if i were to ask you
what age is appropriate to stop taking
showers with your father
i would like to get your opinion
i'm and i'm seeing uh in the comments
from two to
six
six seems a little old doesn't it
i'm seeing eight ten
ten years old
really
there's somebody here who thinks that a
ten-year-old girl can take a shower with
her father
you know i respect that there are
different cultural norms but that one
surprises me
i'm seeing four
two to three
i'm seeing some nevers
so yeah i think i would be
maybe a little closer to that never a
category of myself
yeah
colin says never stopped
never stopped
she's 35 still going
all right so we don't know how much of
this story is true
and uh i would especially caution you
that things like a reference to how old
she was when she was taking showers with
her father remember
these are really sketchy memories i'll
give you the larger context
the larger context
is that she has some memory problems
am i right
so i'm going to do what i think i would
do if this kind of allegation were
against trump okay
we're gonna try to play this fair
and if we're playing a fair the first
thing we have to say is that the diary
itself if it's real
number one we don't know if it's real
number two if it's real the larger
context says she has
deep problems with her memory
right that's the context she has deep
problems she admits
with her memory of things which seemed a
little sketchy in her past
if you say in the same context as this
claim it's like right on you know it's
the next page
of the diary allegedly if you say that
you have trouble
trusting your memories
and then you say that
you have to put that in the same context
of the person who's saying it doesn't
know if it really happened
and when i say really happened
i mean at the age she imagines
right because it may have started it may
have stopped actually younger than she
remembers for example so in other words
let's say
and i'm not i'm not alleging this is
true i'm just saying so that you can
think of how
how these stories can be wrong in the
fog of war
imagine if she really stopped at two but
she has a memory of stopping of four
and believes that four was way too old
just guessing speculating
but that would explain it and remember
the whole context is she can't trust her
memories from that time
so
i would say that we don't have any kind
of a
smoking gun it's just an interesting
story
definitely a red flag
definitely a red flag when you put it in
the context of other
joe biden strange behaviors around
children
but
definitely not
some kind of a kill shot or anything it
doesn't look like that
all right uh but certainly a red flag
all
right
now what do you think of the what do you
think of the if it's true
that the fbi was looking for it
what does the fbi have to do with that
is it just because it's a presidential
thing
how does the fbi get authority to even
be involved
they probably found it somehow but it
makes you wonder how
all right um
as
someone pointed out to me on twitter
biden got infrastructure deal done and
trump could not is that fair
is it fair to say that biden got
infrastructure done and trump
did not
that's fair
it's literally true
but i would add some
context one of the ways he got it done
is by using a trump technique
i'm pretty sure that the
infrastructure bill
passed as large as it is
in part because it started out as
sounding like 3.5 trillion
it was a gigantic first offer
which allowed him to get probably more
for infrastructure than he would have
otherwise
and maybe even it made it possible i
don't know it's hard to know but
if trump had done this started with a
big number and then negotiated down to
still a big number but smaller i would
have said yeah that's what he always
does
that's good technique
start huge
negotiate down because in truth
biden made us think a trillion dollars
wasn't really that much
right
in your mind
in the past year
can you confirm this for me i'll say
it's true for me
and then you can say it's true for you
or not
that in my mind a trillion dollars went
from an ungodly amount of money you
can't even imagine to well okay i guess
we're talking trillions now
right how many of you normalized
trillion
i would say i did
now if you didn't i'm not you know it's
not a universal
but i'll bet a lot of people did
i bet a lot of people did now and even
if you swear you didn't i'll bet you did
a little bit
all right so i mean it's up to you to
tell me how you feel i can't tell you
how you feel but if i had to guess
a little bit i'll bet each of you moved
a little bit on that even if it doesn't
feel like it
uh but then i would add yet further
context which is uh biden's the one who
got us out of afghanistan but that had
just to do with the timing of it right
if trump had been reelected trump would
have gotten us out of afghanistan
probably in a different way
but some of it's just timing right it
was just time for infrastructure
but you know we we put off
infrastructure as long as we could and
then it was just time so i think whoever
was president would have gotten it done
it was just times
but the way we credit or um
or criticize presidents is what happens
while they're in office
if you're going to use the standard that
i would have used i would have used the
same standard if it had been trump um
biden got it done
so you can like it or hate it and that's
fair but he got it done
and that's can't be ignored
all right
here's the scariest story of the day
turns out we don't have a
commander-in-chief
have you noticed
you think you do because you got this
whole president situation
abided
but here's why i say we don't have a
commander-in-chief
i would say the biggest problem at the
moment in the country it's arguable but
i would say the biggest immediate
problem is the supply chain problem
would you agree
would you agree that that's the biggest
immediate problem even if you think
inflation and debt and climate change
are the bigger problems
nuclear war but immediately
like like right right now
the supply chain is the biggest problem
would you agree
all right let's just say it's a big
problem
so you would expect that the president
of the united states
would have a good handle on
the biggest problem in the united states
at the moment
pretty fundamental assumption right if
it's the biggest domestic problem the
president should understand it and be
all over it
and yeah have we noticed that he doesn't
seem to be involved in any way
right
governors are involved and citizens are
involved and even i'm involved
i i've been working on it you know
mostly as boosting message i mean that's
all i can do but i've been working on it
what's biden been doing have you heard
anything i haven't heard he'd done
anything now we know why
now we know why biden hasn't done
anything he doesn't understand the
problem in his own words
he said the problem was and and by the
way he condescendedly said that the
public wouldn't understand the supply
chain problem
he goes are you kidding the the public
would never understand the supply chain
problem too complicated
and then he explained it he said it's
because uh
plants factories basically close because
of covet
two things that biden said at the same
time it's too complicated for the public
to understand
and here's the reason because a lot of
plants
when i say plants that's a misleading
word i mean factories manufacturing
facilities he said a lot of them closed
during the pandemic that's it
now
does baiden really believe
that the general public can't understand
that statement
that factories closed during the
pandemic and that's why we're behind
he didn't think people could understand
that
he said that out loud
at the same time
i'm not putting two conversations
together this was the same conversation
too complicated for the public to
understand
and it's because factories closed during
the pandemic temporarily
he said both of those things at the same
time
here's what else he's a hundred percent
wrong that's not the problem
that's not the problem
the problem is we don't have enough
chassis to move empties because we gotta
the problem is actually closer to the
opposite
the problem is there are more goods
ordered and coming in then we can handle
biden says the problem is we're not
making enough stuff
exactly the opposite of the problem
exactly the opposite of the problem
and do you know what this means
tell me in the comments what this means
like you do the implication
uh he's 100 wrong about the problem and
the public even knows it for the most
part
even the public understands it better
than he does
we have no leadership it's worse than
that
let me say a statement that will just
chill you
he's never been briefed
he's never been briefed on the problem
just just take a moment just take a
moment to
think about that
no matter how much you say about his
mental capability and i say plenty
the truth is that when he appears in
public
he does say coherent things a lot of the
time
most of the time right you know we make
a big deal when he's a little incoherent
sometimes but sometimes that's taken out
of context etc he's mostly very coherent
in public we don't know about behind
closed doors
he hasn't been briefed
he would totally
his capabilities would suggest totally
that he if he had ever been briefed on
this problem he could reproduce it
does anybody disagree
if he had been briefed
because he does it on every other topic
on every other topic such as
the 450 000
you know alleged payment to the uh
immigrants
he explains clearly and succinctly oh i
was talking about the dollar amount
being bs
not about the fact we're dealing with
them and here's why and here's the
thinking
completely cogent right
but on this topic
he's not just babbling
he's never heard about this topic
literally
he's never been briefed i think we can
conclude that with some certainty
because if he's been briefed
and he still doesn't understand it
then he has to be removed immediately
because it's not that hard
you know we got backed up
not enough chassis to move the empties
that's basically the story right you
don't think he could remember that for a
day
even in his degraded state he could
remember that for a day could have put
it on a little note card a little bit of
note card oh here's the problem not
enough chassis
here's what we're doing about it
i don't think we have a
commander-in-chief
and i don't think we know who's in
charge because nobody briefed him
you somebody needs to ask this direct
question
peter ducey would be a good choice
here's the question
mr president you said the supply chain
is a problem caused by
pandemic closing factories
there are no experts who believe that to
be the case
have you even been
have you been
briefed
on the problem
and who briefed you
asked that question peter ducey and it's
the end of the biden administration
if that question is asked in public
mr biden it's clear that you don't
understand anything about the supply
chain because you think it has to do
with factories
and it doesn't
who briefed you on this
who briefed you on it
ask that question it's the end of the
biden administration
and i don't think he'll get asked but
that would end it wouldn't it because
that's the one that shows you he doesn't
have a grasp or he's not even being
filled in
on stuff
um
there is more than one supply chain
problem that's true
that's true
but the the emergency one is the one
we're worried about now there is a
larger we need to train more truckers
and
stuff like that but that's not the
immediate problem
all right
that's pretty scary no
commander-in-chief
or if we have one we don't know who it
is
now as uh adam dopamine pointed out on
twitter today
there's another announcement referring
to the biden administration as the biden
harris administration
and adam dopamine on twitter not his
real name
asked this question
when before
have we talked routinely about the
administration with the vice president's
name on it
is that common
now when you're running for office
you're talking about trump pence but did
anybody talk about the trump pence
administration
when they're just routinely talking
about them
i think you only talked about them in
the context of running for election
right
so is this the catalyst on the roof is
this them getting us used to the fact
that
it's really a team and if kamla makes
the decisions tomorrow
but biden did today that's fine because
it's all the same team it feels like
they're softening you up right
it does
um
now here's some good news remember when
trump was president and uh it felt
embarrassing because other leaders of
other countries were mocking our
president even somewhat openly
and it felt bad and we're like ah i hate
it because
other leaders are mocking our president
well here's the good news we fixed that
we fixed that because you don't see
biden get openly mocked by other leaders
now of course the reason for that is
that he's mentally disabled and the
other leaders are being polite
but on the other hand you have to admit
it worked
it's not the way i would have played it
but it worked
they don't mock him anymore
so we've got
that always look for the good news
my favorite story which is probably fake
news but i'm going to treat it like it's
real
because here's how you treat news that
you think might be fake news
does it agree with you
if it agrees with you go ahead and use
it standard standard procedure
if it's funny
go ahead and imagine it's true
because and by the way
i would like to give this advice to you
should i ever be the subject
of another hit piece you know sort of
the
um
you know sort of the bar stool approach
so i'm assuming that somebody's going to
come after me hard
again when elections crank up you know
just as they did in the i don't know if
you remember this but bloomberg
did a pretty brutal hit piece on me
when uh i was talking saying good things
about trump when he was running the
first time
and i would expect somebody to take
another run at me just to you know quiet
my voice
but hasn't happened yet but here's my
advice to you can i give you some advice
should you hear horrible things about me
in the future
you won't know if they're true or false
i mean you might have a suspicion one
way or the other but you won't know i
mean basically i'll be the only one who
knows if it's true or false
so here's my
advice
if it's funny
just believe it
or if it agrees with your with whatever
opinion you already had then go ahead
and believe it
chances are 60 chance or higher it's not
true
but if it makes you feel good i give you
uh i give you my blessing if it's funny
go ahead and believe it
so if you hear something like that the
richard gere
stuff you know
you know that richard gere
famously
an actor all right many of you if you're
too young you don't know
but a famous actor and the rumor was
that he wants and by the way i don't
think i don't think this is true but for
a long time the rumor was that he had to
go to the emergency room because a
gerbil
was
stuck up his rectum
in some kind of alleged sex play and he
had to get it out
now
i may have said this before in public
but i've never liked richard
richard gere so much
as i did when he didn't deny that rumor
i've never loved an actor more honestly
the rumor was he put a gerbil up his
butt for sex reasons
and he didn't deny it now i may be wrong
about that maybe somewhere he did but he
sort of simply just didn't address it
now i love that
i love that because i don't think it
happened but he let you think it would
happen because he let you enjoy it
now richard gere studies zen right
that's sort of his
philosophical nature and i feel like
i feel like that was the perfect zen
response
if you want to believe it
go ahead
and so i would like to be as big a man
as
uh richard gere should this ever happen
to me
if you want to believe it whatever it is
yeah in the future
go ahead
if you like it
if it entertains you go ahead
you have my blessing
all right but uh here's the story the
independent uh
publication i think it's a uk
publication
uh they started their article with this
this is good this is good writing
this is good writing right here
boris johnson may have uh hailed joe
biden as quote a big breath of fresh air
but it appears that events at the uh the
climate summit conference in glasgow may
have given the duchess of cornwall on
some level grounds to disagree
that's right so
biden was called a big breath of fresh
air but the story is that
apparently when he was meeting kamala
the duchess he uh felt he farted
uh so long and so long and loud
it was impossible to ignore
and apparently she can't stop talking
about it
um and what i love is that uh the
president's alleged fart
was classified not only by its uh
audible volume but by its length
yeah so now we've got a sense of how
loud it was but also how long it lasted
and i don't know if you know but that is
uh two of the most important uh
variables in a fart
how loud and how long does it last now
there are other ones you know there's
of course there's the the whole uh short
consideration so there's much more to
this topic but i think that two
important things are the the the volume
loudness
loudness volume loudness volume stop it
stop it the loudness volume is all i'm
talking about
and uh
and the length
so apparently those were impressive
and uh
on twitter a twitter user called
becoming alert
has suggested that because of the
situation they might need to rename
air force one
to air force two
i'll just let that sit there for a while
yes they might have to rename air force
one to air force two
okay you have to give me that one i mean
not me it's not my joke but
that's pretty funny
as dad jokes go that's pretty funny come
on
admit you know you liked it air force
too
excuse me allergies
all right
so again i don't know if this happened
but it's pretty funny
um
so glenn greenwald is reminding us again
in a tweet he said the last two dog
indictments
doj indictments
uh the first was uh hillary's lawyer and
i don't know if you call it hillary's
lawyer and then of christopher steele's
main source
uh shows that the clinton campaign
funded and fed to the fbi a gigantic
batch of lies in the 2016 election which
the vast bulk of the media spent three
years ratifying and spreading
now
is it my imagination or is this story
too big
for our brains
to
process because i feel like that's
what's happening
i feel like the democrats in particular
spend so much time you know believing in
russia russian collusion
that when the facts come out that the
story was literally the opposite
that hillary seemed to have some russian
connection
at least through the russian american
guy who was born in russia
and
even the lawyer had some connections to
russia and i guess and they did this
disinformation campaign and the media
which is obviously
illegitimate
spent years saying it was true
the story is so big
that i don't think our your brain can
handle it
not yours
but i think the brains of the democrats
because they're normal not be i'm not
saying democrats have small brains or
something i'm saying that a normal brain
put in the situation that the democrats
are in now
i don't think they can see this
i think it's invisible
i think that cognitive dissonance
really creates like a
like a blind spot
where this is actually invisible
similar to the many hoaxes i'll talk
about that in a moment when when you
find out something you believe to be
true is just completely opposite
your brain can't really spend time on it
anymore you just have to sort of act
like it didn't happen and walk away i
feel like this is such a big
mind effort
that the democrats can't wrap their head
around the fact that it wasn't just not
true
it was opposite
it was opposite and that the worst thing
we've ever seen in this country i would
imagine
certainly worse than watergate
let me ask you this
joking aside
is this worse than watergate
no joke give me give me your honest
answer no take the politics out for a
moment if you can it's impossible but
just
if you're just going to be absolutely as
unbiased as possible
is this worse than watergate
yeah it's not even close is it
right
i mean usually i ask a question like
this i'm going to get a little
disagreement but this isn't even close
and how much attention did watergate get
a lot more than this
the news is going to treat this like it
didn't happen i mean the same people who
spread the lies up until now are just
going to act like it didn't happen and
they are
successfully
they are
successfully
successfully making the story go away
biggest story
i know biggest story in years in my
opinion what's bigger than this
what pulling out of afghanistan maybe i
don't know barely pandemic
pandemic's pretty big news but i don't
know if it's as big as this
this seems pretty big
all right
um i finished watching uh tucker
carlson's series the patriot purge how
many of you have also watched
the tucker carlson special the patriot
purge three parts
all right now i recommended it to you
based on just the half of the first part
because it was mind-blowing and it is
mind-blowing and i recommend it but i'll
give you my full review of it
and then
might make your viewing more fun
number one um it is not it doesn't seem
like it was intended to be
an unbiased approach
can i say that
[Laughter]
can i say that it doesn't look like
there was an attempt to make it an
unbiased approach it's a biased
right-leaning approach to it now if you
look at that and then compare it to the
rest of the news you might be able to
triangulate what's true but it's not
trying to show you both sides it really
isn't so be aware
that it will paint the uh
the january 6th event
as
sort of uh
sounds a little bit more like a stroll
in the park by the time you're done i'm
exaggerating here but i think
it starts out by saying that the story
was exaggerated in the other direction
and it makes a credible case for it
which is that the media was calling it a
deadly day deadly attacks etc but
literally nobody died
on the
police or
you know government side there was one
protester was killed
in in
circumstances that a lot of people have
questions about
but that was the only death
and the media pretended that there was a
uh a pl um
i don't know what it was a capital
police or police officer but they
pretended that he was uh injured and
died later of his injuries and none of
that happened he seemed to die from
unrelated reasons but not long after
but he wasn't hit by a
a fire extinguisher and he wasn't bear
sprayed so that part we do know
so
um
so tucker does make the case that it was
exaggerated to how bad it was
but here's my
pushback on that
in my opinion if a unpredictable and
here's here's the key word unpredictable
i'm not saying they were dangerous
and i'm not saying they were not
dangerous because that you don't know
when you're in the middle of it you
don't really know
right
so it was unpredictable and if an
unpredictable mob who are pretty angry
gets inside the building where our
elected officials are
in my opinion you can start shooting
now i don't think that i think it's a
tragedy that um was that uh ashley was
that her name
was shot
while protesting
so um you could argue all day long
whether the shooter made the right
decision or not
because it's a very specific situation
but i'd say in general
if an unpredictable angry crowd gets
inside the building with your elected
leaders you can start shooting
i'm okay with that
right now i think that it was maybe
misunderstanding maybe it wasn't that
dangerous who knows
but if you get an unpredictable crowd
inside my government building and my
government officials are are cowering
and hiding inside yeah you can start
shooting
i'm okay with that
now
just my opinion i know i know many of
you disagree and uh i'll allow that you
can have some disagreement on this one
the the other thing that uh the tucker's
special patriot purge did really well is
back up
a prediction that i made
and got mocked for do you remember my
prediction before the election that if
biden won
republicans would be hunted
it's confirmed
now not every republican in every way
not yet
but it's pretty clear and i think tucker
makes this case really well
that
the people who have been locked up do
not seem to be anything but political
prisoners
that means they were hunted they were
literally looked for by facial
recognition and every other means they
were hunted down people who were there
for peaceful reasons
were not accused of any violence
whatsoever
were hunted down
and
don't you think that this is part of a
larger demonization of trump supporters
to make it easier to arrest any trump
supporter without a reason
keep in mind that the allegation i don't
know if this is true but sound
incredible that even right now
there are people in jail for non-violent
crimes like in solitary confinement and
stuff i mean some pretty bad stuff
happened to those protesters who were
not accused of a violent crime many of
them
now they were certainly in the wrong
place at the wrong time
but um
i would say that the
how many would give me this
so this is a judgment call right
so would you say that my prediction that
republicans would be hunted
has been borne out
obviously not every republican is being
haunted right
uh on locals lots of yeses
let's see over on youtube what do you
think
did that did that prediction bear out
seeing some yeses true yes yeah mostly
yes's now
keep in mind how much i was mocked for
that
didn't that sound crazy
i mean even even people who were you
know right leaning or independent
said you know you've gone too far
they're not going to be hunted literally
hunted and jailed
literally
haunted and jailed
that that's happening right now
and
apparently we're okay with it because
we're letting it stand
i don't think we'll be okay with it on
2022 or 2024.
i feel like
it's game over
i think democrats are going to have a
defeat like
nobody's ever seen
at this point unless something really
big changes and of course something
really big always does change
so that's the trouble with predicting
but
at the moment
it's going to be a blowout
2022.
it's it's gonna be it's gonna be
just
it's just gonna be big
i think
that's what it looks like unless
something changes
all right let's see what else is going
on uh
so part of part of what makes this uh
january 6th thing so bad is that once
you
sort of create the standard that if
somebody is adjacent to white
supremacists or adjacent to a crime
that's close enough
because that's really what happened with
these people who were basically
trespassers and protesters
they were adjacent
to worse behavior
they weren't there for that behavior
they didn't approve of it but they were
in the vicinity
they were in the vicinity that was
enough to go to jail and get
uh you know basically mentally destroyed
in jail
so
um that is a really dangerous thing now
let me give you some context you ready
um for my audience
it is very important
that at least you see both sides to the
extent that i know both sides
i want you to put this in context
the things you're thinking that the
democrats are doing
you know looking toward
some kind of totalitarian
communist situation
[Music]
putting republicans in jail etc how much
does that sound
like what the left thought trump was
going to do
it's pretty similar right
don't you think that the the left was so
sure that trump was gonna round do you
remember they actually believed he was
gonna round up lgbtq people and put him
in camps
that was literally something that they
talked about
trump's the most
pro-lgbtq president of all time
i mean biden i think beats him but but
up until that point he was the most
pro-lgbtq president of all time i think
correct me if i'm wrong but he never had
any thoughts about that category and
they were negative that i'm aware of
he's not even blamed of like that one
time he said something insensitive
nothing
and and yet we were sure that some
portion of the country was sure they
were going to be rounded up
well i would say that the actual
rounding up of these uh patriots who
were at the january 6th
goes way way further
than anything that trump did although
you know they're going to argue kids in
cages and stuff like that
which of course is part hoax
anyway just keep in mind that uh
everything that you imagine is your
worst fear about the biden
administration
was similarly believed
by democrats about trump and they were
completely wrong
right i mean at this point you can say
they were completely wrong because none
of it ever materialized nothing nothing
that matched their deepest fears
about what a trump could do in office
none of it
ended up being even close to anything
that happened
am i am i wrong i don't think so
all right i would say
at this point that the trump
administration is largely defined by
three great hoaxes
but i'm going to add add some
the the hoaxes that define his
administration are first the russia
collusion hoax
which we now know was engineered by the
democrats
the fine people hoax
which was engineered by the democrats
and and their press and the drinking
bleach oaks which was engineered by the
democrats and the press
so
if you think about it they came up with
a hoax
that would fit every category of what a
president does
so the russia collusion hoax
sort of made him you know an unfit
commander-in-chief if you would believe
the hoax the fine people hoax would make
him you know a racist and the
drinking bleach oaks would make him the
worst president for a pandemic
so they come up with a hoax that matches
each of his job descriptions it's not a
coincidence
there's no coincidence here now here's
some more i would say that the january 6
insurrection is a hoax
based on some real stuff
but a hoax
is anybody who would disagree with my
characterization
of january 6 as an actual insurrection
where they actually intended to take
over the country and hold territory
you'd agree that was a hoax right
at this point there were real people
doing real bad things and they need to
be punished
the legal system will take care of that
but that was a hoax right
so that hoax is the one to keep him keep
trump out of office that's the point of
it
um but there was also the kids in cages
hoax about
about
immigration
now if you're saying wait a minute that
wasn't a hoax he actually put kids in
the cages yes
yes he did
exactly like obama did
following obama's the obama
administration rules which required it
now it looked worse because the volume
went up you know the number of people
came across but the hoax part is to
imagine that it was
it was trump's plan
it wasn't he was just following the law
the obama law
um
and by the way i'm not not in favor of
putting kids in cages in case you
wondered
here's another one how about the hoax
that the courts have ruled there was no
election flaw at fraud
that's a big one
the latest hoax
the courts have all ruled even
bill maher believes this one
i would love to i would love to have a
conversation with bill maher in which i
just went i just run down the hoaxes
and see how many of the hoaxes he
believes because i'll bet he believes
half
and and i like to use him as one of my
examples i have like three people i use
in all my examples because they fit
everything
but bill maher is really well informed
bill maher is very well informed and
i'll bet
it's just a guess
i'll bet he believes at least half of
the hoaxes
anybody want to take that back i bet if
i talk to him personally
it would be great to do it on camera
i'll bet you believe half of them
and
and that's a well-informed person
that that's how deep this goes that's a
well-informed person
um
and then of course the mocter reporter's
disability
now how many of you you know that was a
hoax right the one where um he allegedly
mocked a reporter's disability by doing
an impression
i think most of the people on the right
have seen the compilation where he does
that same
the same impression he does with a
variety of people who are clearly not
physically disabled
it's just something he does when he
thinks somebody's being stupid he goes
like that
right i mean if you've seen the
compilation clip you know it's a hoax if
you haven't you think it's definitely
true
why wouldn't you
so the number of hoaxes that defined the
trump administration is incredible
i mean this is really incredible
now certainly there are hoaxes about
biden as well but
um
but
i guess we we live in the world of
hoaxes
all right speaking of hoaxes
how many of you believe the following
statements all right so i'm looking for
a yes or no and i'm going to give you a
statement about the pandemic and you're
going to test
whether you have fallen for a hoax
yeah not so funny now is it
because it because you're wondering oh
crap
i hope this isn't me
all right so here's my question and
we'll find out who fell for it
how many of you believe
that a vaccinated person on average not
an individual but on average how many
people believe that vaccinated people
spread the virus as much as
unvaccinated people go
how many believe that vaccinated people
spread as effectively as unvaccinated
vaccinated and unvaccinated
i'm seeing yeses and no's
so do you know which one is the hoax and
which one is true
i'm seeing lots of no's
joe blow says i believe it
i say yeses and yeses and no's all right
here's the answer
how do how do you spread a virus that
you don't have
that's the answer
people are vaccinated they clear the
virus much faster that's not in dispute
if you
if two people get the virus at the same
time
the the viral uh the peak viral load is
pretty similar
but the person who's vaccinated clears
it quickly and is much less likely to
get it in the first place
much less likely
so
even though the peak viral load is the
same for a short period
the person who's vaccinated doesn't
spend much time in that condition
compared to the unvaccinated person
now if you're doubting
somebody saying wrong in all caps
i can't tell if that's oh i was gonna i
was gonna hide you but that might have
been a joke so this is where you can't
tell if parity and
reality emerged so somebody said in all
caps wrong
and i can't tell if that's a joke
i mean i don't know
it might be
um
so anyway so some of you are still
disagreeing now if the science changes i
will change my opinion as well
but
as of now i don't think anybody in
science doubts the two facts
that you're less likely to get it if
you're vaccinated and you are
less likely to have it for a long period
which means
that you're way less likely to infect
somebody if you're vaccinated
you can still do it though all right
and now they're talking about having to
get vaccinated every three months
uh let me ask you this if the government
says you have to get a booster every
three months
too far right
too far
that's just not going to happen
telling me to get two vaccinations was a
stretch
but you know it's an emergency so we got
it done telling me to get two
vaccinations plus a booster
is already
stretching my willingness to comply
but i probably will because you know in
for a penny
so you know i'll probably double down i
haven't decided yet but i'll probably
double down with a booster
now
so i'm i'm a compliant
wouldn't you say even to a fault i'm a
compliant citizen
would you agree
that i'm a compliant citizen because i
got the vaccinations pretty much the way
i was told to do
let me say this
i'm not going to get a booster every
three months
i'm not come on
especially as the
therapeutics are coming online i'm not
going to get a boo let me just say it as
clear as i can if if the government is
listening
i'm pretty compliant
i'm just the kind of citizen you want
right i say the pledge of allegiance
i don't kneel for the flag
i get my vaccinations
i'm not gonna get a vaccination
every three months forever
can i say this as clearly as possible
i'm a compliant citizen
but no
no i'm not going to get a vaccination
every three months
no
no
no
hard no
 you no
that's the that's the lowest no you'll
ever get from me
all right you can't get more no than
this
this is a hard no
so if our government decides that's
going to be the new standard
it's over
it's over
meaning that their ability to lead us
will just be done
just done
because i will not be led
that poorly
i can put up with a lot of poor
leadership
we all can because it's a messy system
right sometimes they're just guessing
but they're guessing on our behalf
and but this wouldn't be guessing this
would just be too far just too far
and i don't even care if the science
supports it
do you
let's say the science supported it
and you even believed it i'm not going
to get a vaccination every three months
just not going to happen
not in the context of having
therapeutics if we didn't have any
therapeutics
maybe
maybe i might be scared into it i guess
but not with
the therapeutics no
all right
um
thomas massey had a interesting question
see if you agree um representative
massey tweeted if the vaccinated are uh
more likely to have asymptomatic
covet
in other words you wouldn't know if you
had it if you were vaccinated more
likely than not
when they catch covet why doesn't biden
mandate
require testing them weekly instead of
testing the unvaccinated
interesting
it's kind of a good question isn't it
now there is an answer there is an
answer to it was kind of a good question
because
uh his point being that if you are
unvaccinated you'll immediately
fairly soon know if you've got symptoms
and then of course you can get tested
but if you are vaccinated and you can
still get it
you have the most reason to test
am i right
if you're vaccinated your reasons to get
tested are higher
than your reasons if you're unvaccinated
because you wouldn't know if you had it
now that's not
it's one of those points that just makes
you think so i'm going to
because massey is one of your smarter
members of congress right so sometimes i
think he's just making you think
about the logic of it right now i do
think that there's you know
there's a reason blah blah blah
i'm not going to give you my math reason
because you won't agree with it anyway i
think it could be defended
but it's a good question
it's a perfectly good question
i think the answer would be either test
everybody or why are you bothering
all right
bill maher was dumping on the children
is climate change
uh
the only the only issue where children
are in charge
can you think of another one
and am i wrong that children are in
charge of climate change
you know through let's say uh
uh tunnberg greta tunberg now she's no
longer technically a child
but her followers are mostly children
and i think children are driving things
right you know hey stop leaving this
burning planet for us
blah blah but it also looks like our
solutions are from children
sometimes
because if climate change were the risk
people are saying
and adults were in charge what would
they be talking about
if climate change were run the if the
topic
were being managed by adults
what would be the main thing that they'd
be talking about
nuclear energy right
adults
no you need nuclear energy why are the
children and why is climate change not
talking more about nuclear power
do you know why
because children are afraid of it
that's why i mean adults do to some
extent if they're not informed about the
newer technologies but
you you can see the signs that children
are in charge
because they don't talk about the
solution
they're afraid of the solution
nuclear
so
we certainly need to get children not in
charge of our
major issues
no matter how major you think that is
and the children are shaming us into
action because they
they believe it because they've been
brainwashed they're the least
rational creatures and they're in charge
of our what they would say and many
would say is our biggest issue
so am i wrong
that the issue that democrats at least
would say is the biggest issue to the
planet
the children are in charge of it
is that wrong
because it looks that way to me remember
i always tell you that we we misread
where power comes from you know we think
that the elected officials have power
not really
they only have power to to help us on
the ones where we can't decide because
the public is
is uh
divided but climate change is just
clearly the children are in charge
somehow we put them in charge and their
fears are making our decisions
driven by fear
children's fear
and somehow we drifted into the
situation and accept it
now let me change everything are you
ready
nothing we talked about matters
that's that's the headline to the next
topic
nothing i've talked about in the news
will matter
there's something bigger coming
it's going to make everything you talked
about
suddenly not matter nearly as much
this is remember i told you there are
some things that
i hear before you hear
here's the one i was waiting for not the
one
but one
so here's something really really big
that i knew about before you
just because i got to hear about it
personally
so sam altman
famous uh investor i think you still
have a y combinator
so if you if you don't know the name sam
altman just google it so you can
understand the story just google sam
altman what you need to know is when it
comes to you know startups and investing
one of the smartest people in the planet
and
one of the more successful ones right
so insanely smart
successful and in exactly the right
place to tell you this
he's invested in and plans to invest
more in a company named helion
which uh
plans to
make net
electricity from fusion in 2024.
now some of you know what that means
let me say it again
one of the one of the most
believable
incredible people in the area of what's
coming
especially somebody who's invested a lot
of money in it
and has been working in this area for
seven years
just told you in a tweet
that they're going to have net
electricity meaning that they will make
more electricity than they will use
energy
from fusion
in 2024
that changes everything
do you realize what this changes
if he's right
and remember
high credibility here
if he's right
everything's going to be different
now you can't even i mean it's almost
impossible to understand how different
this will be
now for if anybody's new to this fusion
would be the safe
safe cheap
form of nuclear
that wouldn't melt down it can't
um and he says further he says this is
what sam says
with the long-term goal of electricity
for one cent per kilowatt hour
electricity might cost
one cent per kilowatt hour can somebody
tell me what your cost of energy is per
kilowatt hour where you live
if there's if there's somebody here who
has a
um
i'm seeing numbers like 13 25
11.
probably depends where you are right
all right this is gigantic
this is gigantic
now do you think that this fusion model
should it work
do you think it will be reproducible
yep
because i don't imagine that that sam
altman would fund something that you
could only make one of them
right he's not going to do that so
obviously they're building a model that
you can reproduce
this changes everything
now
here's why i knew about this before you
did so i actually heard it from sam
alban
got to
hang with him a little bit
a few years ago and he told me about his
investment in this and told me
he said the following statement then
he said it's been reduced to an
engineering problem
maybe you've heard me say that before
but that's where i heard it
it's been reduced to an engineering
problem
they solved the science
the science is already solved
they just have to iterate until they
figure it out
and we know how to do that
we know how to iterate
and so they are
he's iterating to success and he thinks
2024
do you think he would have tweeted this
unless he was pretty confident
i don't know
i mean
i think you'd have to be pretty
confident to tweet this
so again when you hear some a story
that's this big i think your automatic
response should be
well i don't know
right
if you just doubted every big story
about fusion for the last
30 years you would have been right every
time
but
this one's a little bit different
let me say let me put it in a different
context if elon musk had told you
that
you might have fusion in two years
because it looks good would you believe
it
if elon musk told you that
would you believe it if he told you it
was an engineering problem
had been reduced to an engineering
problem we think we can have in two
years would you believe them
some yeses some knows yeah you know i
always i never criticized the skeptics
because doubting stuff usually turns out
to be right
right but uh
so sam altman you should mentally put in
the same category of credible
futurists if you will
as scott adams also invested excellent
question
how come only one person asked me if i
invested in that
isn't that the most logical question the
answer is no
not so i don't have any financial
interest in it
let me tell you what things i do have
financial interest in because that's a
good question
i recently invested in regeneron
recently
so i haven't made any money on it
because you know the smart people got in
a long time ago
i will also tell you
that uh long before you knew regeneron
was saving lives
i already knew that
and i heard it through i can't tell you
how i heard it but
or or why i heard it
but um
if i had invested when i first heard it
pretty that would have been pretty good
um and i don't know if regeneron can
still be a good investment so i'm not
recommending it by the way because the
therapeutics that are coming out will be
a direct competition so the question is
are you going to get both
or do you not need as much now so i
don't know
but so i don't recommend that as an
investment but you should know if i say
good things about regeneron you should
know that i also put a small amount of
money behind it i've also invested in
israel
index fund so if israel's economy in
general does well i do well because it's
a start-up nation and well-educated and
i think they have their security
situation under control
so that's why
uh
what else bitcoin
so i own bitcoin so if i say good things
about bitcoin you should
factor that in
just trying to think of investments
might have some
political element to them
i don't have any coffee investments
don't have any gold
i don't believe in gold
as an investment
i've got some yeah i have ethereum too
uh i don't have a reason to talk about
eth too much but i have some of that
those are the only coins i have just uh
eth and wham my own coin
um
you have m oh yes yes amazon that's a
good point
so i've also invested in amazon i bought
all the tech stocks when they they
dumped the pandemic so by amazon
microsoft
tesla
twitter
i have twitter stock now
[Music]
something else
well let's see
how's twitter stock doing since you
bought it um i think it nearly doubled
since i bought it
i don't want any netflix i should have i
don't own any facebook
uh oh an apple yeah i
i i didn't own a lot of apple stock
originally i bought a little bit of
apple stock but now it's like a major
part of my portfolio because i just held
it
yeah one hub didn't do so well
uh how do you feel about musk dumping
stock i don't know that he's dumping
stock
he's probably just diversified
oh and i yes and i uh own i own equity
in the locals platform that is correct
and i see i see tesla as an energy play
that's adam adam townsend's
observation
um
unrealized profits
didn't you start with locals what do you
mean
don't know what that question means i'm
an investor in locals
small investor
um do i own rumble now
uh you know i don't think anything
happened stock wise i'm not i'm not
close to that actually i should pay more
attention
um yeah i'm an original investor in
locals that's correct
all right
uh did you sell your ether now
you know once i realized that selling
crypto has the same tax
um tax implications as other investments
i just thought i'll just hold it and see
what happens
so the only reason i have crypto is just
as a diversification thing
there is a dilbert nft there's two of
them
look for go to open seas
and then you can find them
they're both for sale one of them for 21
million dollars
last i checked
the taxman will always get you yeah
who has the best locals channel i don't
want to
call
favorites um
well the metaverse makes the bubble
worse
i don't know i don't know that that
would make anything worse
oh the bubble you mean like the
knowledge bubble yeah actually it would
a lesson on the technicalities of doing
an nft oh
yeah maybe
i don't know if enough people would care
about that though
that was bill gates uh toilet project
i don't know
i think he made some great uh
technical technical leaps there
uh scott do you support people resigning
from work ah that's just personal
decisions
to allow audio to continue on live
streams when turning off a mobile screen
um i don't know if that's what locals
controls
is that not um something on your own
phone or your device
i don't i don't know if that can be
modified
uh brett weinstein said weinstein said
he'd be interested in talking to me
well um yeah he's i think he's mentioned
that as well
no he didn't mention that to me that was
i'm thinking of somebody else
um
at the moment i'm not not going to do
too many appearances i'm just overworked
time to feed the kids
do you have any new ideas that will
utilize when tokens yes but nothing to
announce so there is there is something
happening there but don't get too
excited about it
cats doing well
so what
syringes laced with fentanyl killed
caucasians and houston concert i don't
think that's true
all right
i think i would treat that as not true
um do i want to invest in a marijuana
tech startup no not really
yeah youtube premium allows background
audio
but i don't know how they do that
we need visualizations to debunk hoaxes
what app on my phone do i use the most
twitter by far
um
why no gold
the trouble with gold is that
it seemed to me there would be a day
when the psychology of gold just
disappeared
now gold will always have a you know
industrial use
but
uh i feel like and maybe crypto is what
will make it happen if you had a choice
of owning
crypto
especially bitcoin
or eth or eth if you had a choice of
them versus gold
that's no longer a close call is it
because they're both psychology-based
assets but one is
clearly got momentum and one looks like
it's the past
why would there be 11 heart attacks uh
and a vaccine mandated concert
well i don't think there were heart
attacks they were crushed weren't they
if crypto fails gold is back that's true
but that's
uh
read their reports before commenting on
houston
um i'm i'm gonna say that the odds that
fentanyl was killing people in houston
are very low
very low
not impossible
but if i had to make a bet on it without
without reading any of the news
i would bet against that pretty heavily
[Music]
seizures on video
so it looks like there'll be more we
find out
so i'm seeing people saying the syringe
story is true is there other people
think the syringe story is true
um someone was injecting people at the
concert
interesting
i am ignoring the long history of gold
because i think history changes with
crypto
is early reporting fog of war
victims had to be revived with narcan
you know it sounds like to me it sounds
like more like there were some bad pills
at the concert
because it would only take one batch of
uh fake xanax
you know you get the counterfeit xanax
and it's got fentanyl if somebody had
one batch of pills that had too much
fentanyl in it
that would kill
that would kill all the people who died
i'm not saying that happened i'm saying
that would be the
the the odds of somebody was using a
syringe when they could have handed down
counterfeit pills
you wouldn't use a syringe if you could
use pills
um
yeah i i'm
okay i already convinced one of you that
uh the more likely explanation is if if
fentanyl is part of the the story and it
might be
it might be part of the story if
fentanyl is part of the story
probably got into them through pills
and maybe there was somebody with a
syringe also maybe not
but i feel like maybe two stories got
conflated there
the theme of the concert was praising
lucifer is that true
i don't think so
yeah high temperatures dehydration
getting crushed
how's your asthma these days about the
same
poor crowd control
scott forgot his pills today
all right
that's all for now and i will talk to
you all tomorrow
you
