good morning everybody
and welcome to the best thing
that's ever happened
probably in your life and
maybe in the whole wide world
it's called coffee with scott adams the
best thing in the world
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
before we get to the content that is
king
content is king
well what you need is a simultaneous sip
and all you need for that is a copper
margarita glass of tank or gel style
canteen joker flash vessel of any kind
fill it with your
favorite beverage
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
cassandra we love you too it's called
the simultaneous sip it's the dopamine
of the day
it's gonna make everything better watch
go
oh yeah
oh yeah
well here's my first
mystery of the day
um could we have some music
mystery of the day
this is a low production outfit so you
got to take what you can get here's my
mystery of the day
i keep hearing from people on twitter
that they live in a state in which
they've just ignored the pandemic and
everything was fine
is that true
and if it is true
why didn't i know it until now
i don't think it's true
but it might be true-ish
so the the states which were suggested
were georgia south carolina
florida is a special case because we all
watch their transition from
doing stuff to doing stuff differently
but is it true that in georgia or south
carolina
they just basically ignored the pandemic
and everything was fine
is that true
people are saying yes
and now i'm not confused by let's say
wyoming or montana or south dakota right
if south dakota ignored the pandemic and
everything was fine
i would say well that makes sense
south dakota
wasn't wasn't much population there
but how in the world could georgia
with its uh corpulent uh population
how in the world can they just
sail through the pandemic without their
hospitals getting crashed
i don't know the answer by the way
usually when i ask these questions
i've got some sense of an answer before
i ask the question i legitimately don't
know the answer to this
like honest to god i don't know
if there are major estates that just
ignored the pandemic and did fine
i doubt it
but remember what i said at the
beginning of the pandemic is that you
would never be able to
tell which leaders made the right
decisions
which is a wild crazy prediction isn't
it and i said that specifically you
wouldn't be able to compare any two
countries
and learn something
you'd think you were every time you did
one of those comparisons you'd say ah
sweden this and
uk that
but every time somebody tries to copy
somebody other somebody else's technique
they don't seem to get the same result
so leadership and even
you know what processes were used were
way less predictive than they should
have been
you know the experts will still say that
all that clearly worked and there's data
to show it worked
and there's data to show that mass and
distancing and restrictions all
work and vaccinations
but it worked in the sense of you know
decreasing how bad things were
but
if that's true
why isn't everybody doing the same thing
like you know if we know exactly what
worked and what didn't
why are some people just not doing that
and getting a good result or are they or
are they not
it was just a mystery
if anybody can figure that out for me
let me know
so i i was pointing to
the new twitter rules on what you can
and cannot do
and i think that these rules are
so interesting
that i'm going to run through them
because i think your hair will catch on
fire with some of these okay
these are the new twitter rules new in
november i guess
claims to specific groups or people
or other demographically identifiable
entity identity are more or less prone
to be infected or to develop adverse
symptoms on the basis of their
membership in that group
you can't say that
now isn't that the
the official government opinion
correct me if i'm wrong
but isn't the official
government opinion
that black americans are having worse
outcomes
am i wrong about that
did that change
now i i won't get kicked off for saying
that i'm not sure what the truth is
so i'll tell you about this as long as
you're clearly stating an opinion
you're safe
you can't just say something's true
as a fact
and then you know
if it's wrong according to twitter
so
i feel as though this
i don't even understand this rule
because this is the official
science is it isn't it
i have to add that isn't it so i
wouldn't get banned
right if i said the official science
says that black people have worse
outcomes
if i were to say that which i'm not
because i don't want to get banned
i have to throw in
some doubt
like it's an opinion
what am i missing here
clearly aren't i missing something
why why could they say this is banned
all right here's another one
false information about widely accepted
testing methodologies
such as that
pcr tests are unable to detect virus
how many of you believe that it's true
that the pcr tests do not detect a virus
accurately or that they they're
detecting too much stuff or whatever
how many of you believe
pcr tests are
not accurate
in the comments how many of you believe
that's true that they're not accurate
if you were to say that
as a fact
you would be kicked off of twitter
now here's my belief
my belief is that twitter is correct
do i know how would i i haven't it's not
like i'm the scientist who tested the
pcr
test how would i know
but my belief which is different than
many of yours
is that whatever you were reading that
said that the pcr tests are
uh bogus and behind a fake pandemic i
think that's just misinterpreted stuff
i believe i could be wrong
but i do believe that pcr tests are
accurate so i'll give twitter that one
but i could be wrong
um how about this
falsehood you could get kicked off
twitter for this too false or misleading
information about preventative measures
that one can take to avoid infection
such as claims that face masks cause
hypoxia
if you said face masks cause cause
hypoxia
twitter would have a problem with that
by the way this doesn't mean an
automatic ban i think you get worn first
or something
um and you also can't say that face
masks
cause bacteria bacterial or bacterial
pneumonia
and you cannot say these are just
examples
and you can cannot say that
masks don't reduce transmission
you can say it i guess as an opinion but
not as a fact
is your head exploding yet
it doesn't get any better let me keep
going
you can't make false or misleading
information
or you can't uh tweet it suggesting that
unapproved treatments can be curative
so you can't you can't tweet the iframe
ectin
can be curative
not that it is
just that it can
is that the same as could be
i don't know that word is a little
ambiguous can
does that mean you can't tweet that it's
possible
or that you can't tweet that it's a fact
that it works it's a little unclear
um
now the lack of clarity in here of
course is alarming because you know
humans will be involved making judgments
and god knows how good those judgments
will be
but you can't say that vitamin d would
take care of everything i guess
so
yeah i know some of you are not on
twitter but the point is that this is a
major communication platform
and uh
um here's something else you can't say
on twitter the vaccines will cause you
to be sick
comma spread the virus
comma or would be more harmful than
getting coven 19.
you're not allowed to say
that the vaccination is more harmful
than getting covert
are you okay with that
in every case
do you think that
this is a safe thing to say for
everybody in every situation that just a
blanket statement
that uh in every case the shot
is safer than the coronavirus itself
which by the way could be true it could
be true
uh i know it makes you uncomfortable i
don't know you know how much of a
problem that one is all right
um how about
so here's the ambiguity in the sentence
that people i think are misinterpreting
it says the vaccines will cause you to
spread the virus
so you can't say the vaccines will cause
you to spread the virus
but
i think you can say that people who are
vaccinated can spread the virus
right because that's the official word
but i think that's been misinterpreted
as
saying you can't say that people with
vaccinations spread the virus i think
you can still say that because that's
the official thing
but it's not the vaccines that are
causing the spread
so again the wording of this is so
important a little ambiguity causes a
big problem
you can't
you can't uh tweet
any claims that vaccines will alter
genetic code
will alter genetic code you can't do
that
um what do you think of that
do we know that
is it a fact
or
just the current of thinking
all viruses alter genetic code simply
says yeah i think this one seems like a
little bit of a problem because i think
it it depends on what you mean by
altered
are there lots of things that damage dna
if something damages dna is that
altering it and aren't there lots of
things that damage dna
it's not just viruses is it
do viruses damage dna does a vaccine
damage
dna
i don't know any of that but
anyway be careful that
um
here's something else you can't say
false or misleading claims that people
who have received the vaccine
can spread or shed the virus to
unvaccinated people
this is literally the official
the official government opinion you
can't say on twitter
let me read it again
am i reading this wrong
you can't make on twitter
false or misleading claims that people
who have received the vaccine
can spread or shed the virus
to unvaccinated people
what
yeah this is a confirmed fact let's test
it down
we'll see if i get a warning or
well i'm not on twitter now so i guess
that doesn't count
um
i feel like that's just
there's just something wrong with that
right
either either the
guideline is written poorly
or i don't know how to read suddenly
or
you're not allowed to say what the
government says is true
as a fact you can't say it as a fact
that's weird
i mean there's just something wrong here
right um
what you're allowed to do
uh let's say
okay oh you can't also do uh
you you can
you can't make strong or misleading
assertions the fact all right here are
some things you are allowed to do so
twitter specifically says they're not
going to give you trouble for this
uh personal anecdotes or first-person
accounts
so you're allowed to say
you know my cousin got the vaccination
and x happened to my cousin
what would be
the most misleading kind of information
that you could ever have
what would be the single most misleading
information you could ever have on the
pandemic
anecdotal information
now even though it's true
it's so misleading because people think
the anecdote you know represents the
whole
so it turns out that the least valuable
data
first person accounts
are allowed
now i think they should be allowed you
know free speech
blah blah and they're true
i mean if something's true when you talk
about it that's got to be allowed i
guess
but it is the least useful thing
but it's allowed
you're also allowed to have public
debate
um
about you know the advancement and
things changing and blah blah all right
so
um
i guess everybody's concern is that the
rules have enough ambiguity
that
they could be used to ban anybody for
anything
if they were talking about you know the
pandemic
so i saw um i think
at least two people tweeting things they
should have gotten them a warning or a
ban just this morning just to me
these are people who just tweeted at me
specifically
with totally bannable content already
i mean i i i assume they're not going to
be too tough on enforcement here
right
uh so here's the of the day
that uh john heilman who works for msnbc
i think
msnbc
um
he's concerned that uh there are 30
million people this is quote
uh 30 million people right now who are
ready to take up arms
uh quote to restore donald trump in
office
and he says that's not hyperbolic at all
those are the facts
now he says those are the facts i
believe that's based on
some kind of
survey
about the number of people who
thought that you know under certain
circumstances they might have to take up
arms to
reclaim the country or take it over or
something
now i don't doubt
that somewhere there is such a statistic
in which
people on the right
are warning of an armed insurrection
under certain conditions
would you agree with that
that's probably true people said it in a
survey
but of course they would be defining
what the certain situation is right
or are
it's not like they're going to do it
because they don't like the design of
the flag
you know there's not like 30 million
people are going to
storm the capital be with their weapons
because they don't like you know
trans policy or something
so the idea that these 30 million people
are like on the edge of being activated
because they don't like the election or
something
nothing could be nothing could be
further from the truth
nothing and here's here's what i think
the left doesn't understand about the
right
and i want to see if you can fact check
me on this because this is an opinion
but i want to see if you have the same
impression
people on the right
talk about taking up arms against the
government
like people on the left
talk about getting tattoos
it's it's just something they say
[Laughter]
it doesn't mean anybody's going to do it
it's just it's just sort of this
continuous warning against our own
government wouldn't you say
if this were to happen
it's a good thing we have the second
amendment
say conservatives all the time it's just
sort of a general warning
so that so that it's always in the
atmosphere
because you don't want anybody to forget
that there are
30 million or whatever armed americans
who are willing to
try to protect and they're probably in
their way of thinking protect the
country
of course they are of course there are
30 million people who would take up arms
in the right situation
yeah in the right situation with 30
million americans take up arms 100
million would
in the right situation
maybe 150 million
in the right situation let's say a you
know a land attack against the united
states yeah you'd have a hundred million
americans with a gun in their hand in 24
hours
so
i think the left
of course the right gives them this
opportunity by
the way they they use rhetoric
but i think you really have to
understand it's just the way the right
talks
can will you give me a yes or no on that
those of you who spend most of your time
or are identified with the right
it's just the way they talk
and now it's turned into this
30 million people with weapons trying to
take over the country nothing like
that's happened
like
if you were to make a list of all the
things that are possible
that would just be dead last
i mean anything's possible right
but in terms of likelihood just dead
last
dead last it's a total misreading of the
right
um but i would say that if your last
name is
heil man
it's safer to be associated with the
left
because they're not going to make hitler
jokes about you so much
all right uh
there's a story about mark meadows and
he had a powerpoint that he
apparently touched it he didn't make it
but he
he sent it to some people
he's not even sure where it came from
it's this long powerpoint presentation
around this is around the january 5th
and it had some ideas for stalling the
certification of the vote and
you know getting pence to do this or
that that's
unconstitutional
now
mark meadows says
somebody gave it to me and i showed it
to some other people but you know it
wasn't anything i was taking seriously
it's not like he had considered the plan
or anything
i don't know if he considered the plan
but the fact that it was on a powerpoint
had nothing to do with mark meadows he
didn't make it
so
that you know the fake news is blowing
that into some kind of a mark meadows
powerpoint about overthrowing the
government
when in fact he's just a guy who saw a
powerpoint
that's pretty much it january 5th was
the day that this was happening
ahead of the january 6th protests
so
uh i did get the the dates correct
all right here are my
uh best and worst of the year awards my
roundup
okay
here comes the roundup
number one best brainwashing play of the
year
the best brainwashing play of the year
is i tweeted this that um one of the
best applications of mass brainwashing
in modern times actually is the idea
that the january six protesters wanted
something other than
a fair and transparent election result
the the fact that
some gigantic percentage of the country
has been brainwashed to believe that
that was an insurrection
as opposed to protecting the existing
system
which is exactly what they asked for let
us protect the existing system by making
damn sure that this election was not
rigged because it kind of looks like it
might have been
right
that is so far
from the way this is being you know
presented as a some kind of insurrection
so far away from that
but if you're just going to
look at the effectiveness of the
brainwashing it was really good
it was really strong so the brainwashing
play of the year
is that january 6 was an insurrection
biggest hypocrites of the year
the teachers unions
for promoting a critical race theory
as if the teachers unions themselves
were not the main cause of systemic
racism
the the the beauty of this hypocrisy is
is
almost breathtaking
the teachers use being the cause of
systemic racism in the sense that they
are the reason that there's not enough
competition in schools and they're the
reason that you can't get a good
education if you're
black and in a bad part of the country
so
they are systemic
they're the embodiment of systemic
racism but they would have you believe
that they're teaching it
or that they promote teaching it it just
doesn't mention themselves as one of the
topics
hypocrites of the year all right
most racist event of the year ago
most racist events see if you get the
same answer as i did
what's the most racist thing that
happened
yeah is jesse
jesse smollette
now i don't know what the other
possibilities would be if we're just
looking at the year 2021
i'm going to talk about kyle we'll get
to joy reid
yeah
but
um i think that the whole jessie
smollette thing has got to be the winner
and that of course was racist against
white people
white conservatives
uh the political play of the year
the most clever
jesus i just saw the most disturbing
meme i've ever seen in my life
the people on locals know what i'm
talking about but just just be glad you
didn't see that one over there on
youtube
oh that was disturbing uh anyway the
political play of the year is the texas
abortion
uh tweaks
allowing private citizens to sue the
doctors i guess so
i didn't see that coming
and i would say that in terms of just
cleverness
that was the play of the year but
it was so clever that it looks like
gavin newsom is going to use a similar
concept
to put more constrictions on assault
rifles and ghost gun makers
so
it's like a brand new play
that i guess hadn't been used
and uh
that's the political play of the year
worked for both sides
what is the biggest crime of the year
biggest crime of the year
presumed
in parentheses biggest crime of the year
presumed not proven
presumed go
suv attack now
uh bingor
maxwell
uh
uyghurs
jizzlane
uh oh australian concentration camps
well i was trying to focus this on more
american stuff
but
i'm going to say the biggest crime of
the year is whoever was behind
limiting the rapid testing
of the cheap rapid testing in the united
states we don't know who it was or
or even if there was a person behind it
but all indications are that there's
some gigantic crime involved because
incompetence wouldn't really explain it
so there has to be some kind of criminal
activity behind that
so i think that's the biggest crime of
the year based on death count
because even the uyghurs are not being
killed at this at the rate of the
pandemic
and i think that having rapid testing
early
makes less difference now but if we had
it early
probably would have taken a big bite out
of things maybe let us get back to
normal a lot faster
best persuader of the year
who is the most persuasive and
successful
has to be successful the best persuader
of the year go
elon musk
i'm not going to say him but that would
have been a good answer
desantis very good
yeah
i appreciate it if you say me but that's
not what i'm looking for
um
cernovich is always toward the top
joe biden elon musk the answer is
michael schellenberger
michael schellenberger
for
convincing i think
congress to be pro-nuclear
and i i think he's the primary reason
that this is happening
so that's one of the biggest most
important things that's ever happened
and essentially this the form of
persuasion was
reframing things more accurately and
that's the primary way he he persuades
he just teaches them that they have some
older ideas
that they're not updated
so essentially by convincing
all of congress at this point i think
most of it
convincing them that what they used to
think about nuclear power is a little
outdated
and if they were simply current they
would have a different opinion
he brought them current
and now everybody's pro-nuclear you know
the the climate change fear certainly
helped but i think it was shellenberger
it did that and now he's focusing on san
francisco and bad management there and
specifically the thing we call the
homeless problem which is really a drug
problem
because the reason that they're homeless
is they like to do drugs
and they can't do it if they check into
some kind of
managed facility
so
once schellenberger is done persuading
people that they're
not up to date on the information about
this topic and then he brings them up to
date which is what he's doing with his
books and you know continuous
communication on this
uh i think he's gonna turn this one too
and it looks to me like he may have
solved or he's
he's on the way to i don't want to say
single-handedly because lots of people
help but being the most important
character
solving two of the biggest problems in
the country and it might happen he might
get all of that done in like a five year
period
i mean unbelievable really
just incredible
all right uh worst politician of the
year ago
who is politically the worst politician
of the year
that is right kamala harris
this one's not even uh close
all right who's the best politician of
the year
best politician of the year you don't
have to agree with their politics
they were just the best politician
desantis by a mile
yeah there's nobody close right
like who's who's really second
to desantis you know trump is sort of a
uh
omnipresent
character
mansion special case
yeah mansion's a special case because he
just accidentally got all that power by
being flexible but i think desantis wins
hands down for just politicking now
that's different from effectiveness and
whether you like his policies
but just as a politician wow
i'm actually one of the best
i would say desantis had one of the best
years
of any politician
ever
that i can think of can you
can you think of any politician who ever
had a better year
just as being a politician i can't think
of one
um
how about the uh most transparent
 of the year this is i don't
know if this is the biggest one of the
year but it's what i saw today
so it just you know got to me today
so this is a little hyperbole for me but
the most transparent of the
year
boris johnson talking about the omicron
just i think yesterday
and he said
that uh one person has died with omicron
they've died with it
uh does anybody see any transparent
there's one person who died
with it
not because of it
with it
all right now he throws that in there
as if we're not going to notice the the
width part all right but it gets worse
that wasn't even the part i was going to
go to right i'm just building up to it
i'm literally just building up to it
he said that we should
i'm paraphrasing a little bit but this
is pretty close
we should ignore the mildness of the
omicron
meaning the fact that it's not killing
anybody that we know of
and that
i'll tell you later that
there's not any case of a bad outcome
this is another tweet i saw today that
there's no case of any bad outcome from
omicron not even the hospitalization
much less a death
not even a bad hop a hospitalization
are you hearing that that says of you
know some information that got tweeted
around today you see that on my twitter
feed if you want to see the source
but here's what boris johnson said about
this and in the face of it being so mild
he said we should ignore the mildness of
the omicron again i'm paraphrasing not
exact words we should ignore the
mildness of it the omicron and focus on
its pace of infection
what
no the mildness is why we should be
happy about the pace of infection
i want more infection not less if it's
true that it's super mild
and so far it's looking that way right
so you could you could see that he's
trying to keep people panicked so they
can control them in terms of their
mitigation strategies
but here's what he should have said if
he was being even a little bit honest
you know we might find some surprises
from this omicron that's more dangerous
than we think
at the moment it looks like it's going
to get us out of the pandemic
but don't relax yet
because i'd give it a good two weeks
before we feel confident about that
when the omicron reaches 75
as you know new infections
then we probably need to rethink our
entire strategy that
would be a good leader statement
not we should ignore the mildness and
focus on his pace of infection you
 idiot you idiot
that is so transparent can you
give us the mild respect of not lying so
obviously to our faces
a little bit of respect please boris
johnson
you know the brits i always think the
brits are sort of
leading us all in politeness
in terms of you know
public discourse
but seriously a little bit of respect
please
a little bit of respect this is not
respectful
it forget the fact that it's
forget the fact that it's you know
closer to a lie than an actual honest
statement
this is disrespectful
this is just flat out disrespectful
and i don't think we can let that you
can't let that pass without mention
right
lying to us cleverly
even you know if it's for our own good
or whatever
maybe you know i'll look at that a
little bit differently but don't
disrespect us by lying obviously
no obviously
all right
here's the uh
most shocking story but not really of
the year
so the this the quality had to be two
things it had to be shocking and at the
same time you knew it was going to
happen
or something like it
here's the shocking story but not really
the pfizer asked for 75 years to produce
data concerning the pfizer and bio blah
blah blah vaccine
that is freaking shocking
but not really
not really
right yeah the the russian collusion
hoax
uh
you could argue that that was the
biggest um
revealed hoax of the year
but probably the biggest hoax of the
last five years but it's the biggest
revealed hoax of the year i'll give it
that
all right how about uh the biggest mass
murderer of the year
here we'll go international
biggest mass murderer
and i'm looking for a person's name
biggest mass murderer of the year
yeah
yeah president
xi of china
not even close
because you've got the coronavirus you
could argue you know whether that should
be on the list or not under
she but certainly fentanyl
the fentanyl is all you need to know
about the biggest mass murder whatever
they're doing with the uyghurs whatever
they're doing with the dissonance and
taking their organs out and selling them
you put it all together and president xi
biggest mass murderer of the year
but a special mention
to whoever stopped the rapid testing in
america because that may have been i
don't know that could have killed a
hundred thousand people
it's hard to know but i'd say whoever
was the stopper of the rapid tests or
who whatever group or people
may have killed a hundred thousand
americans
but that's not even close to what she
has done not even close
all right
most inspirational event of the year
most inspirational what made you feel
the best
the most inspirational thing kyle
rittenhouse interesting
that did feel good
uh i have to go with uh elon musk's uh
space flight
now bezos gets
sort of a you know sort of an also ran
credit
and you know
so does
richard branson sir richard branson
but i think elon musk
set the standard for this
and i got to tell you that
uh it was the one time this year that i
just got tingles
like that that just made me feel good
about everything
so most inspirational events of the year
and of course elon musk is times person
of the year and i like that pick
uh what is the best news of the year the
best good news now the rocket launch is
inspirational but you know it's the
beginning of a long process of what we
hope to be good news of space
conquest
but
best news of the year
somebody's saying omicron
that's on my list
that's third on my list is omicron is
the best news of the year so far
i mean we think
it's a little too early
here are the other ones
co2 emissions have been flat for 10
years
did you all know that
i believe that's true the co2 admin
emissions from humans
have been flat for 10 years now
that's a big deal
uh but also advancements in fusion and
the turnaround and opinions on nuclear
energy i think the the nuclear and the
fusion stories even though fusion is you
know not commercialized yet
we know it can be now
now this may be the flying car of all
flying cars and it never gets
commercialized but i think the right
people are telling us it's an
engineering problem now as opposed to an
invention problem
so i think we're
i think we can say with confidence at
this point
that fusion will be here
five years ten years twenty i don't know
but it's coming i think it's coming
now i'm i'm an optimist so could be
wrong about that all right what is the
best
disappeared story of the year the best
disappeared story
a story that
should have been
a lot of candidates right waukesha
you've got the uh
biden's
uh hunter binds laptop
um russia collusion
disappeared from half of the half of the
coverage so you've got yeah you've got
gallane
you've got
the written house the fact that he shot
white people
instead of black people
yeah there's a lot of
competition but i think the waukesha one
is the most
blatant
so i think i'll i think i'll put
waukesha first
um
all right
what is the biggest analytical mistake
of the year
biggest analytical mistake of the year
not by any one person but by people
what would you say
biggest analytical mistake of the year
bitcoin somebody says
vaccines work
uh no that's not what i'm going for
global warming now that's not really of
this year
rigged elections no inflation no
uh i'm going to say comparing countries
during the pandemic
i think the biggest analytical mistake
is to think that you can compare two
countries and
know something
now at the beginning of this live stream
i said
can we compare those other states
because that's a little bit better
comparison
because because at least states within
the united states is a little easier to
find a comparable
like you could find something that's a
little bit like georgia
such as south carolina you can find
something that's a little bit like
montana
such as south dakota perhaps
but you know if you're comparing a
european country or america to sweden
there's just too many different
variables involved there so i would say
that
comparing any countries and thinking
that that told you something was the
biggest analytical mistake of the year
and
last year too
all right
vex mandates um oh actually yeah
yeah but i'm not sure that's an
analytical mistake i i think that's a
government is the wrong tool for the job
mistake
you know let me return to a point i used
used to say a lot
the government is the wrong tool
for deciding when to get back to normal
a government is a good tool for let's
say
defending the country you know you want
somebody in charge of the military
centralized professional group
so governments are pretty good for that
but what they're not good at is deciding
which
which citizens will live and die
right
because you can't get reelected if you
decide that some citizens are just going
to die
but that's what we have to do
to get back to normal so it's not a
government
kind of thing they could do unless
they're a dictator if you're a dictator
you can just say oh it's time
everybody dropped the mandates but if
you're a democracy and you've got to get
reelected
you can't say all right we're going to
throw old people under the bus
everybody go back to normal
yeah yeah yeah a lot of old people will
die
because of the extra risk of this but
yeah we're just going to make this
reasonable decision
the old people they've they had a good
run
so we'll just let the old people die
government can't do that
not not anything in a democratic
republic kind of situation because they
have to get reelected what happens if
you if you're the one who kills all the
old people
what happened to
andrew cuomo
for letting the you know the nursing
homes be unprotected
so the problem is that the government
just can't make the decision and i will
tell you over and over again
in at least in the united states
and you know this would be different in
australia apparently but in the united
states the people will decide when it's
over
the people will decide and the fact that
it's not over means that the people have
not decided
now the people are somewhat brainwashed
by their leaders so we have to work
through that
but don't lose sight of where the power
is
the the government's only power on the
pan that makes the brainwash you
which they're doing pretty well
[Laughter]
but you have the actual functional power
you just have to get enough of you
meaning the public on the same same side
at the same time but that'll happen
right i mean it's inevitable
so the the slippery slope here is that
the public
will regain full control
if it needs to
to take that control away from the
the government
all right
facebook is uh being sued by uh john
stossel
for i guess they said they did a fact
check on some of his
climate change information and they said
it was false and misleading and so they
um
they i don't know what they did they i
don't know if they banned it or labeled
it whatever they did
but uh stossel is suing them
because he claims that the facts about
climate change that he presented were
true
and you know there's enough
science behind them that they're
pro-science he's on the side of science
and
here was facebook's defense
that their fact checks are mere
statements of opinion rather than
factual assertions
so if facebook's opinion
is different than your actual facts
you're in trouble
and they say it directly
this this is very clear they're saying
that their fact checking is quote
from their lawyers mere statements of
opinion rather than factual assertions
so if their mere statement of opinion
disagrees with your actual science
as apparently was the case with john
stossel that their mere opinion
disagreed with his actual science
that john stossel is the one who has to
pay for that
i mean pay in the sense of having his
content uh
you know
gated
so
um
from a legal perspective i think this
was the only way they could go right
you know in terms of a legal strategy
they kind of had to do this didn't they
because how could they defend that
they're the keeper of facts
you can't
it's indefensible to say we we do know
the facts nobody can say that
not in our world
so we'll see let's keep an eye on this
this is interesting it says some
precedence maybe
now i sat in a tweet and people were
confused by us i'll explain it
that
republicans are attracted to
self-correcting systems where democrats
are drawn to self-destructive systems
and that doesn't make sense until you
hear some examples
all right here's a self-correcting
system
the free market
see what i mean
if there's if there's a problem
in the economy a shortage of something
the free market will eventually fix it
by
attracting other people to provide the
product so republicans very in favor of
a self-correcting system called free
markets
likewise a democracy democracy itself
the the constitution
the constitution is a self-correcting
system is it not
because it says oh when there's a
problem
here's the process to fix it it could be
the court system could be another
election
but it's is clearly spelled out in the
constitution
that the systems are self-correcting and
it even tells you how gives you the
exact details of how these systems
will be self-correcting and
self-balancing and
and all that so those are
self-correcting systems
uh i would say religion is a weirdly a
self-correcting system too because you
could be sinning like crazy
get to your deathbed and
accept jesus
and you're all good you've corrected
so that works in some cases now compare
that to
um
systems favored by democrats
like a critical race theory
critical race theory is a
self-destructive system
because if you teach that people are you
know victims of other people in their
country
it's pretty predictable that it's going
to rip apart the fabric of america
that's a self-destructive system you can
see it from a mile away
it doesn't have any self-correcting
elements to it
right it is devoid of any element that
could be self-correcting it's a one-way
trip
someplace you don't want to go how about
full socialism you know not not the kind
where we pay taxes so that other people
can have health cares
you know in some level but if you want
full socialism as many would like it
again you get rid of human motivation
and human motivation is the key to the
self-correcting part
if you ignore human motivation you don't
have any kind of a system that can
self-correct
it just goes where it goes which is in
the toilet
about reparations
now no matter what you think of
reparations
is it going to make anything better
even if you think it's called for
even if you think it's fair
even if you can make a perfectly good
argument for it
it kind of
just begs for more reparations doesn't
it
like when are you done
i don't think there's any
self-correcting
element built into it because the moment
you said yeah let's do some
reparations for people who are no longer
alive now this is different by the way
than reparations for a japanese
internment which i was completely in
favor of
the people who got the japanese
internment
uh reparations were still alive
these people were in the freaking camps
right i knew quite a few people who were
actually
literally in those camps because i was
had a relationship with a
japanese-american woman for years
and her older brother
so i actually was in a long-term
relationship with somebody whose older
brother was in the camps the the
japanese internment camp because he was
much older
i mean think about that that's my
lifetime
my lifetime
yeah i was in a room full of people a
number of times
you know at the holiday events in a room
full of people where
most of the people in the room had been
in japanese internment camps in the
united states
in my lifetime
i mean that's just that's just
mind-blowing
um but yeah reparations in that case but
if you start doing it for for uh uh
ancient
ills no matter how bad those ills were
slavery was you know the baddest of the
bad
uh it's just it's a one-way trip
so i would look at that every time you
see a difference between the democrats
and the republicans look for that
self-correcting element
you consistently find it in the
in the right-leaning systems
um
all right
how many of our national problems could
have been solved by having rapid tests
that were cheap early
now some some say wouldn't have made any
difference because europe you know great
britain has rapid tests for free as many
as you want
and it isn't making that much difference
but i think it would have made a
difference if we did it earlier
you know
right
um
so
i think the following problems were
exacerbated by not having rapid tests
the budget
would you agree
that you know we
because of the shutdowns we had to give
you know direct payments to people etc
so if it's a big gap but if the rapid
tests have been available earlier
could we have evolved
a budget blow up
could we have therefore controlled their
inflation better
therefore would we have had to supply
supply chain problems probably ask
because it would still be in other
places
would we have the same crime pandemic
health care problems you know there was
a whole snowball effect
snowball effect so i think the the lack
of that
instant testing or the rapid testing was
a much more gigantic problem
than just the fact that it would have
been nice to have better testing
i'm looking at a
comment from michael myers here
he says pair the self-correcting framing
with grievance filter framing
so to
i guess that would be one way to say it
that the democrats have grievance filter
uh
uh government creates backwards
legislation to make it self-replicating
okay that's a little bit too complicated
for me
but i like where you're going with that
dr funk juice you sent me a message i'll
check that out
all right
yeah you know the trouble with the
grievance filter is
so here's a persuasion tip
if if you want to say that the systems
are better on the right than the left i
wouldn't use that framing of calling it
a grievance filter even though it is
because as soon as you say that that's
sort of fighting words
that's that's a little bit of a
you know as soon as you label a
grievance filter you've
you've sort of departed reason and
you're into
partisan talk
i i think you can take all of that out
of there by saying that some systems
have a self-correcting element built in
and some do not
because there's there's no um
there's no emotion in that statement
you're looking at it like it's a machine
you're engineering a system you you're
not talking about it
with hyperbole and
you know and all of your partisan stuff
just say one has self-correcting nature
one doesn't why would you ever want a
system without a self-correcting
element
all right
um
the best beam of the year best meme of
the year had to be let's go brandon
wouldn't you say
um
what about russia
all right i think this was my best live
stream of all time um maybe the best
live stream anybody's ever done anywhere
in the history of the world
um oh i to answer one more question for
you i think
and to give you a key learning here lots
of times when things don't make sense
it's because of insurance
this is one of the best filters to have
on reality if you understand how
insurance drives business decisions as
in if you do this you can't get any
insurance
that's a big problem
insurance kind of drives a lot of the
business processes you just don't see it
directly and somebody asked us why why
do you have to wear masks on planes
when there are some other so many other
places like restaurants that people just
take them off to eat
and this seems to be not a big problem i
mean i'm not hearing about a bunch of
restaurants causing spikes and
infections here's why i think liability
and insurance and why a restaurant would
be different than a plane if you take a
12 hour plane ride
and you get covered
you're going to think it's because of
the plane ride am i right
you're gonna say somebody on that plane
gave me covet and you're probably gonna
be right and you might even be able to
find out who had it you know you could
find out who on the plane
in some cases they can track it down and
say oh it's the person sitting right
behind you which they've actually done
and
but you can't really do that in a
restaurant can you
because people who eat in restaurants
might eat in several restaurants
and you would be it would be impossible
to identify the specific persons who
gave you anything because you wouldn't
even know if you got it in the
restaurant right
so suing a restaurant would be next to
impossible because you wouldn't really
be able to demonstrate that the
restaurant did something that caused you
to get
the virus you wouldn't even know where
you got it
but
if you take a long enough plane ride
you're going to have a much better idea
where you got it
and that's a liability
so
i believe that airplane um
ceos
uh the the people running these
companies have decided that they have a
very special case where you could
identify
that if they'd done something
differently you would have a different
outcome meaning that if somebody got it
on the plane and masks were not required
somebody would do a lawsuit
and say you know i wouldn't have died or
my relative wouldn't have died
if you had required
masks and i don't think restaurants have
that
that risk
so i think
that the insurance filter is the reason
that airplanes in particular have to
have the strictest basically they have
to do everything
you got to be vaccinated
you know ideally vaccinated and have a
test
and wear a mask
and be six feet apart and you know you
just have to do it all
is there anybody with enough business
experience
that can validate my assumption here
anybody
you can sign waivers
good call
right yeah they could they could make
you sign waivers
but i don't know that signing waivers
i'm not a lawyer but i don't think
signing waivers
protects you against
an obvious error
right if you do something that's
obviously unsafe
you still get sued even if waivers are
signed right
if if it looks like a mistake that you
could have easily corrected
you know it's one thing to sign a waiver
for a dangerous sport
because you know that's a voluntary
thing etc but flying is a little closer
to a public
necessity um
my business loans would be called if i
lost my insurance that's right so it's
not just the insurance problem
it's that if you have any loans out that
are protecting the lender the lender is
going to call the loan as soon as you
lose your insurance so that's the thing
too all right so i don't know if
insurance is the full reason that
airplanes are different than every place
else but that would be the logical place
just because you could identify where
you got the infection so that's just a
guess and keep that filter the insurance
filter it's really useful
really so stefan says yes correct
i think that's right all right that's
all for now talk to you tomorrow
