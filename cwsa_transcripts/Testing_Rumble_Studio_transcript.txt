well hello people I'm testing the new
Rumble
studio so this is just a technology test
if you have a minute to uh put it in a
comment um tell me where you watching me
from if you're
commenting are you watching me on X or
locals or
Rumble uh I see your
tests hello hello
everybody
Crawley I know which one you're
on so let me know which one are you
seeing it on so you should be seeing it
on four different platforms all from one
laptop is there anybody who's having any
sound problems or any other
problems how is the Sound by the way
sound okay I'm not using a microphone
I'm just using a new laptop Mac
laptop all right well people are not too
talkative cat wants coffee though hey
Cat Gregory
Hines Dr Hines
hello so which which platforms are
working right now is uh is the xplatform
working all right locals is Great Sound
is
great no sound issue
um all right good sounds is good I'm
seeing people on
Rumble uh YouTube okay I sees me on
YouTube so YouTube is working I see
Rumble oh the icons are different so I
can see if your locals I guess I could
have told that all right so we got those
working I don't see
X is the X platform working working
looks like it's not or maybe they don't
have comments let me
check going to go look for myself on the
xplatform
now yeah let's see if it's uh streaming
sound is
good let's see
am I Live Well there I am sure
enough so it looks like when you comment
on X it doesn't come through it just
stays on X so I think what's happening
is people are
commenting but um you're watching an x
on the
Firefox sounds great does it sound as
good as when I use my
microphone
because the new laptops probably have a
really good microphone built in might be
as good as the uh clip
on disgrace landscaper good to see
you locals Works Rumble works oh my God
it's all
working do you realize I'm streaming on
four separate platforms right now and
it's all
working that's that's pretty
amazing I wasn't really expecting it to
work
work all right so all we're doing is
doing a little technology test what I'm
trying to do is see if I can upgrade my
equipment see if that makes any
difference with the glitches but also I
can add the X um platform and Rumble at
the same time so I'm going to go from
two platforms to
four if this works so I'll incorporate
this into my morning show tomorrow if my
test
works
all right so the one thing it doesn't do
is Advance the comments on its own I
have to do
that I look like a taller skinnier maor
James Keenan you know I wish I had a
nickel for every time somebody said
that all right we're going to do a chat
delay
test I'm going to give you a number and
you have to repeat the number in the in
the comments so then I'll know how long
it took you to repeat the number
all right so you just write write a
three-digit number that I'll give you in
a moment and I'll tell you how long it
took before it showed up all right get
ready to type the three number digit
is 111 111 go
11 how fast will it show
up not there
yet
111 there we go all right so Rumble has
it um YouTube has it Rumble was first I
think Rumble and YouTube were tie X
won't
show and locals has it all all right so
there is a little bit of a
delay but it doesn't seem too bad does
it 34 second
delay uh you saw it before I set it oh
that's interesting so there's a little
video caching going on
too no ads with the brave browser
okay so you actually saw the number
before I said
it interesting so I guess what's
happening is that uh my video is delayed
the same amount as the
comments so what's that going to do to
me so I'm going to have to get used to
the fact that the comments are delayed I
guess
or are they I'm a little
confused the YouTube delay is
longer that's not a
surprise now we're just doing a
technology test so I'm te I'm testing
the uh new Rumble Studio
software if we are locals should we move
to rumble no if you move to rumble the
only thing you'll see is the morning
video uh but if you stay on locals you
get the comic and you get robots read
news and you get the calendar and you
get any other posts and the and also the
man cave at
night you're 100% with Dr
funus
it may be less delayed when we are
locals only yes it will be so when I do
locals only I'll just do locals I won't
use the
studio huge variation with just
locals Beverly I see
it and we can't reply to other comments
oh that's
interesting you can't reply to other
comments H so that is a downgrade isn't
it there's not as much of that in the
morning there's more of that in the
evening hey Dr Funk juice DJ Dr Funk
juu Biden took all of your money
okay can I start and stop streams to
different platforms at different times
oh there's a good question the answer
is
um let me
look I don't see that
option it looks like I could
probably let's
see no it doesn't look like
it uh on Rumble is should be real coffee
with Scott
Adams yeah yeah so I'd have a problem
because I wouldn't be able to do the
pre-ocs
comments I don't think there's a way to
reply to
comments well actually let me do this if
you're on locals and you reply to
somebody on locals will I see the
reply do me a favor if you're on locals
just reply to anybody's comment on
locals and say you're replying
delay seems to be too
much YouTube
there internet in the kitchen of
course uh yeah that wouldn't be
acceptable I'm going to have to figure
out a way
to I'm replying all right so Crawley I'm
seeing you
reply but it doesn't match it to what
you're replying
to so it doesn't show the original just
the
reply looks and sounds good from where
you are
good reply to
replay reply to
replay what does that mean
reply to
replay so on locals you're
replying do I make a wish on a shooting
star not usually so rumble's 15 seconds
out of
YouTube and Rumble is 18 ahead of
x 15 seconds seconds is too long 15
seconds is way too long isn't
it um but there might be a way for me to
change
that yeah I won't know who you're
talking to if you reply on locals that's
true
so
um 324 on YouTube
Rumble and locals are synced that makes
sense seeing me
double can you count
321 and then we'll see the
delay will that
work wait I don't understand how that's
going to
work
it's working better than you
thought your YouTube and Rumble are
about a half a second
behind huh yeah the picture quality
should be better because the front
camera is is good and the processor is
good so everything should be a little
higher quality except for the
delay let me see if I
can gu I think I do have a way to add
things
later pause stream and redirect viewers
to rumble oh that's
interesting I could redirect all the
users to rumble if I
want Studio add new theme no that
doesn't do
anything all right so it doesn't look
like
start screen
sharing manage
participants oh show you your phone
clock and you'll tell me the
difference all
right
uh how come it only looks like that
I don't have
seconds I only have only have minutes so
it's not going to help is
it all
right here we
go well when I did the number thing that
that should have
worked so let's do
this when you respond I'll I'll now that
I know that I can tell which uh service
you're on I'm going to give you a number
another
number and you I'll give you another
number and see how long it takes before
it shows up all right so in the comments
write the number I tell you and then
I'll see how long it takes to show up
the number is 300 go
300 how long before it shows
up one two three four
five
six seven eight all right so a seconds
for
rumble about to say for
locals still don't have
YouTube we should see it in four
seconds YouTube should come online yep
there it
is yep so YouTube is about 15 seconds
behind that's
unacceptable locals is
current then I just have to figure out
how to get locals on
here first before I go live with
everybody
else all right I'm going to try to get
rid of
one it says there are zero people in
locals on X but that's not
real
all
right yeah that's not
real all right ladies and gentlemen
we're just doing a technology test here
to see if I can stream on all of these
services so you know what I think I'm
going to
do
locals I think what I'll do
is um I might start the Stream on my
phone or or an i iPad before I I go
live so I probably have to use a
separate device to talk to you before
and
after probably more talking before than
after YouTube needs the lag to edit
comments YouTube is 5 Seconds beond
Rumble for the viewers but not the chat
okay we're all in live chat including
locals
yeah so I could do my phone to talk to
you and then I could go live so I could
do that I wish I didn't need two devices
though do use Trump as a screen to take
out
dtz did the I don't know what you're
talking about
turn off Rumble and leave I don't see a
way to turn off
Rumble so I'm looking at my
screen
