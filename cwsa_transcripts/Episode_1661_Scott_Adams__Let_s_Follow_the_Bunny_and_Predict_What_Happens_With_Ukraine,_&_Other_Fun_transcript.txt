good morning everybody
and congratulations
on arriving at the best place in the
world at the best time even if you're
watching this recorded it is the best
time still
i don't know how that works but i didn't
take a lot of physics in high school
however one thing i do know and every
scientist will agree
the simultaneous sip will make your day
better and all you need is a copper mug
or a glass a tanker chelsea stein a
canteen juggle flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite
beverage
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better
except ukraine
and it happens now go
i'm seeing a disturbing note on locals
that somebody already drank their coffee
prematurely
we'll have to talk about that yeah
unauthorized sipping
now actually you're always authorized to
sip without me
but don't over sip
if you overstep there will be nothing in
your vessel
it's a problem
all right the most important story of
the day this comes from the omicron
olympics
there was a finland skier who suffered a
frozen penis
that's right uh he was a finnish
skier he suffered a frozen penis
you might say he was finished
now
what was not included in the story is
what you should do
if you're the first person to come
across someone who has a frozen penis
so let's say it's up to you to do first
aid
and you're the first person on the scene
now
you're going to have to find some way
to warm the penis
of the person who needs the first aid
some kind of
warm uh i don't know
place or
cavity
someplace that you know would be nice
and warm
now
here's my advice
if you're the first person on the scene
to treat somebody with a frozen penis
you should immediately say i'll go get
help
that's what you should say i'll go get
help
because you don't want to be the first
person on the scene when there's one
only one way to treat it if you know
what i mean if you know what i mean wink
well i went into
my local
grocery store yesterday
of course masks in california are now
optional
for adults in most situations unless
it's a medical or senior care or
something
and i walked right into my grocery store
with my
maskless face as as i have for weeks but
now it's legal
guess how many people
in california northern california
wore a mask
optionally
how many customers not not talking about
the staff the staff were mostly in masks
but how many do you think
wore a mask
didn't need to
the answer is eighty to ninety percent
it took me a long time to find even one
other person without a mask
obviously republican
i hate to say that that the masculist
people were obviously republican
because you know that
that imagines some stereotype
but if i may
the massless people were
obviously republican
don't ask me
how i know
what a republican looks like but you
know what a republican looks like you
kind of do you kind of do you know you
do
and they were the only masculist ones
well truth social uh platform is uh
getting closer to launching i guess the
beta is up this is president trump's
new social media platform
and
i asked myself well what could go wrong
well yeah what could go wrong with
this
how could it go wrong and then i saw a
tweet from dean uh
obadila
obadiah
he often appears on cnn uh and he's sort
of a user designated you know pit bull
to go after republicans and trump and
here's what dean obadiah says and his
tweet
the fbi needs to thank trump for helping
gather the personal information of white
mass and other right-wing terrorists
with his new social media platform at
truth social
um
[Laughter]
um
are you gonna sign up
i think he talked me out of it
i don't know this is a pretty good
reason not to do it
honestly
i mean i wanted to succeed
and i was i'm very
spring-loaded to sign up i already have
the app downloaded i just you know
waiting for it to go live i have beta
invitations i just haven't used any
somebody says don't be afraid
but let me ask you this
if you know that trump supporters are
literally being tracked and rounded up
do you want yourself on that list
it's actually a real question i i think
that this dean obadiah guy
did actually a tremendous job of
of you know
pissing in the punch bowl
and that's actually that is a scary
scary tweet
honestly
they have your stuff already yeah that's
probably true for people like me
yes um wow
so
yeah that's going to be a problem now
obviously
uh other alternative
platforms have not been huge successes
or as big as they could have been
but
this might because i think you can't
ignore trump
am i wrong
you you could maybe not use an
alternative you know to twitter or
something
but it's hard to ignore trump if he
becomes the main story in the elections
see you'd kind of almost have to have an
account
and so i asked myself wouldn't the
wouldn't the press have to have an
account
just to track him
you think so right like if you were a
member of the press you'd almost have to
join
even if you didn't use it every day just
to look at stuff that people talk about
yeah
so we'll see how this goes
maybe you'll get a little bit of people
on the left
so lieutenant
texas lieutenant governor dan patrick
he's got this idea for
blocking tenure
in public universities and colleges
in an attempt to stop the teaching of
critical race theory
and i asked myself
can you do that
with legislation
can you tell an entity even if it's a
public school
can you tell a public university or
college
to not have tenure
now i'm seeing people say yes
i suppose you can make a law
about anything as long as this con the
law is constitutional but this feels
like this feels like a weird overreach
doesn't it
it feels like an overage coming from the
republicans
because i feel like the republican party
it should be more about
you know leave leave everybody alone and
let them work it out
but this this would be sort of a direct
meddling in the way they do business
i'm not sure how i feel about it
i get that it might work i get that it
might work
but i don't know that this is a way to
do it exactly what do you think of it
i don't i don't think we should have
tenure
so
you know i'm against tenure but i don't
know that i don't know that the
government is the way to do it to get
rid of tenure
you know it's
but here's a uh interesting question
if i do say so myself
wouldn't you say that the education of
our youth is so connected to homeland
security that you can't afford to do it
wrong
right would you all agree with that we
can't afford to educate our kids wrong
because it's just the entire you know
security of the country in the future
depends on it
so
in that case
could the government say you know
we have to fix the biggest problem which
is teachers unions
and
tenure so could the government say
in order to fix education we're going to
get rid of teachers unions and tenure
could they do that
would that
would that pass all constitutional tests
i don't know
i don't i don't know if it would
it feels like it might
i don't see an obvious problem with it
but uh
i i think that would be the way to go
after
improving the schools is to just
directly say there are two problems with
schools that make them anti-competitive
it's tenure
and it's the school
it's the school i'm sorry the teachers
unions and so just get rid of them
there's no reason not to do that right i
mean in terms of constitutionally you
could do it
well i don't know if if dan patrick can
actually do this ten-year thing
in texas it does open up a
question about using that technique more
often i just don't know if that's a good
idea for republicans
well we have a hero story i think this
was on cnn a professor of african and
latin american studies
who had been a professor at george
washington university for a long time
taking advantage of her
her background she wrote extensively
about africa and latin america and so
that was sort of her her thing she was
an expert on that and
of course it probably helped that she
was
identifying as african and latin
american
turns out she was none of those things
she was just a
white woman
who had pretended all of her life to be
a black
and slash latina
now
this is not the first time we've heard
this story is it
am i right
we've heard a few stories of white
people trying to pass as black
why is it that nobody tries to pass as
white anymore
now people have said this before but
this story
gives me an opportunity to say it again
there's only one thing you need to know
about this country
that people will pretend to be black for
financial advantage
that's it if you wanted to unpack
everything else you need to know about
the united states
you could just tell them that one fact
and if you uncoil that it would tell you
everything about the united states it's
just the one fact
that pretending to be
a disadvantaged racial minority is a
huge economic benefit
i'm not wrong
pretending to be the most disadvantaged
minority
would guaranteed guaranteed
be a huge economic benefit for you if
you played it right
doesn't work the other way does it
are you hearing any stories recently
about the black person passing as white
to get a job
that's not happening anywhere
not in the united states
nobody's pretending to be white to get a
job that would work
so
it's easy to get lost in the detail you
know who's teaching crt and who's
kneeling for the national anthem and
what are cops doing to minority
people etc those are all important you
know interesting questions
but if you wanted to just summarize the
whole thing
if you wanted just one one story or one
fact that would tell you everything you
needed to know about the rest
is that pretending to be a disadvantaged
minority
is the best economic plan you could ever
have
and nobody disagrees with that which is
weird you know if i said that and other
people said scott
oh you're crazy
you're crazy scott
that will never work well of course it
works it works really well
it works great everybody's ever tried
this says it works there are very few
things that work as well as that
actually
anyway
apparently i saw a tweet by ian miles
jung
saying that the ottawa police are going
after local businesses that supported
the truckers
there's a coffee shop that served coffee
to the truckers
and the officials are closing them down
for serving coffee to the truckers
now
i'm no
military strategist
but let me just
put this out there
if it turns out that putin invades
ukraine
and if it turns out that the cover
or the the diversion of that allows
president xi and china
to attack taiwan
i think that would be the time to make a
move for the united states to invade
canada and try to free their citizens
because
i do see a cry for help if you know what
i mean now i don't know how much
stinger missile you know anti-aircraft
and anti-tank weaponry canada has
they probably have a little
but no second amendment right
so i feel like we could
maybe not control the entire of canada
because most of it is just
you know
snow and
a moose here and there but there's this
little this little corner of canada
where pretty much 90 of all the
population lives is sort of the valuable
part
we could just take over that
just
just take over the populated part leave
the rest you know for the for the
mice the mice what's the plural of moose
mises the nice
the mooses
mooses
i need a fact check on this
uh
is
moose is plural as well as singular
well i'll be damned did you know that
that moose is both singular and plural
so you could say look at that moose
or you could say look at all those moose
hey there's moose in the backyard
just one oh hundreds
well
if we didn't have enough reason to
attack canada
we should at least attack
for the benefit of giving them
proper
plural words
because apparently canada doesn't have a
plural for moose
and i think they need one
so if we could just bring them a plural
for moose
and freedom
but not coffee
not coffee if you bring coffee to
anybody in canada you could be closed
down but i think we can invade
i think we can uh give them a plural for
moose and i think
we could have a beer with them
and it would probably be the uh the
least violent war of all times
something tells me the canadians would
just sort of welcome you in you know
like if the american army appeared on
the border
the canadians would be like hey come on
in have a beer
and the americans would be like what
yeah come on in you have a beer
and we'd be like
okay
and we'd you sort of conquer canada but
nobody would really know it happened
it would be more like a conceptual thing
we'd end up partying because we like
canadians
so we'd end up partying and drinking
beer
and complaining about the lack of a
plural for moose
and then we'd go home but
i think we could bring some freedom
while we're there
so just think about it
60 minutes had a
program about the alleged secret sonic
or maybe microwave
weapon that has been scrambling the
brains of
people all over the globe
and i ask you why is 60 minutes doing a
story of that now
why would 60 minutes do a story on the
secret sonic weapon
now
what would it what would be happening
now that would make that a story
because it's a little bit sort of maybe
anti-russian isn't it
is that a coincidence now i don't know
if the story ever
tried to pin the blame on anybody
but
remember originally
when we talked about it the speculation
was it was some kind of russian
weapon and there's no evidence of that
whatsoever
and i think it's a ridiculous hypothesis
but i wonder is it a coincidence that
this
vaguely but not really proven russian
connection to a thing that may not even
exist in reality at all
is it a coincidence that happened right
now
just when russia is poised to attack it
doesn't feel like it
does it feel like a coincidence to you
i mean it could be coincidences do
happen right
well i just put that out there but the
uh their bottom line was there seemed to
be
a thousand incidents that have been
reported
but they don't have any idea what the
you know what the cause is basically
it's a whole story that says we don't
know what the story is there's just
something or or not
um
so as uh jack possabic uh reports uh
carmel harris is doing a tremendous job
starting off in her
in her assignment to uh be the lead on
this ukraine business
and if you want to hear some inspiring
words
this is what our own vice president
harris said
when she was asked
will sanctions deter putin so jack
busabek was tweeting about this and
komlihera said and i quote
and
if if anybody here needs to be inspired
if you're feeling down a little bit
i want you to listen to the
inspirational words of our vice
president and watch how this makes you
feel i think it'll pick you up a little
bit
and so vice president harris said when
asked will sanctions deter poon
she said within the context then of the
fact that
that window is still opening although
open
although is absolutely narrowing but
within the context of a diplomatic path
still being
open i'm sorry there's a tear came to my
eye i've never been so inspired
it's beautiful it's beautiful
well
so putin uh is apparently doing some
kind of a
uh reality tv show right now in which
his security council
is meeting with him to decide the uh
fate of ukraine
and it's
televised
now i haven't i haven't seen the feed
i've only seen the reports of it is
anybody watching that
and i don't know if it's easy to watch
with the translations and what yeah i
think i think in real time putin is
videotaping a live session of his
security council now of course it's all
it's all fake right because everybody
knows to say what putin wants them to
say
but
uh
we may be finding out the future of
europe
with a reality tv show
that could actually be in real life like
no exaggeration it's a reality tv show
and it will determine the fate of europe
now it's not a real real reality show
because we already know the the outcome
all right um
i saw this great article on also cnn by
matthew schmidt
as we're trying to figure out
what might putin do and why might he do
it the why is the why is the interesting
part
because i guess maybe there's so many
reasons that that why doesn't make sense
because it's really a bag of good
reasons that are all individually good
and collectively even better
so but let's
let's see what we can
learn that we didn't already know so
this is from matthew schmidt he says
first of all there are a lot of
ukrainians living in russia
a lot of ukrainians live in russia
people have ukrainian
you know
background i guess
how
how happy would ukrainians living in
russia be if russia turns his guns on
ukrainians
they're relatives
it's a civil war
among people who know each other
that feels like the least popular thing
anybody could do
could you imagine
you know the president united states
attacking
florida
well everybody has a friend in florida
is there anybody here who doesn't have a
friend in florida
or a family member in the comments tell
me how many of you have at least a
friend or a family member in florida
just to pick a random state
a lot right
how many russians have a friend in
ukraine
i don't know
i don't know but it's a lot
right
i i remember uh
when kim jong-un was was threatening to
nuke uh the united states
and some smart people were saying he
won't nuke uh
his his friend uh
what's his friend not trump uh
basketball player
who's the basketball player who's
friends with
rodman yeah
so somebody said he's not going to nuke
his friend
dennis rodman
and you think about that and that's
actually a pretty good reason
it's actually a pretty good reason
that you know even even if kim jong-un
had some
wild crazy plans would he nuke his
friend
the guy he invites over all the time
i don't know
it's actually a perfectly good question
i don't know that he would
would you would you nuke your friend
it's pretty hard to do
so that's a factor that uh you know
putin has some domestic
stuff he has to worry about
the other thing is as matthew schmidt
points out ukraine might have way more
effective weapons than the russians
think
who told you that
that's what i've been saying for a
number of days
now i don't know
that ukraine has much more effective
weapons what i know is that nobody knows
i know i don't think putin knows
for example putin wouldn't know how many
anti-tank missiles they have and you
wouldn't know how many stingers they
have right
and he wouldn't know where they are
necessarily he might know some of that
but he's not going to know the you know
the bigger picture
so
um
and so the technology and the training
are way different than anything russia
has ever encountered with their modern
army
so russia has never moved against
anybody who had this kind of weaponry
what's going to happen
when was the last time the russian army
took got a like a serious bloody nose
like somebody actually
made him retreat
i don't know maybe never and well i mean
since world war ii or something
uh well afghanistan was sort of a low
slow bleed i'm talking about a an actual
army moving in and just getting its ass
kicked
and having to retreat
like on the battlefield like not even
being able to go forward
that could actually happen
i i think the ukraine ukrainians might
have enough
weaponry to you know block
an armored
armored movement i don't know we'll see
so putin has to deal with the fact that
there's a huge unknown about the level
of resistance
and
here's here's the big question for me
do you think is profitable
do you think that putin has judged that
that if things go the way he wants them
to go
that russia will make more money
or
be worth more
and
here's my question
if we can come up with a economic
forecast for climate change
think about how complicated that is
coming up with an economic forecast for
climate change now of course i always
say that that's basically impossible too
many variables
you know too long a time frame
but we still do it
and we do it for persuasion purposes
don't we it's not exactly to know what's
going to happen
it's more because it's persuasive to put
a price tag on things
why is there no price tag on this war
not for the united states and not for
nato
because we sort of have to do what we
have to do
but it's an optional war for putin isn't
it it's an optional war so why isn't
somebody said if you do this
you'll lose this amount of money because
there'll be sanctions put on so you can
calculate that
now you can't calculate anything
accurately but again
does it matter
we still do it for climate change we we
do inaccurate predictions for lots of
things
because it at least tells you what the
scary parts look like potentially
so
wouldn't you like to see our economist
say all right let's let's do the the
pluses and the minuses here
so putin's going to spend x amount of
money directly on the military
so you could probably estimate that
don't you think
you know because we've got the satellite
so we've got some rough estimate
of what wars cost
so i think we could put a number on that
then you could say what will happen with
the sanctions
you could put a number on that might be
a range but it'd still be a number
what would happen with
um russia's future sales of uh
of of gas especially
well you could probably put a number on
that because of let's say fewer
pipelines in case they get closed down
et cetera
now you could also you'd also have to
put i think a value on ukraine as an
asset
so it's not just his expenses you know
what's it cost to keep the army running
you know how much did you lose from your
oil sales it's not just that he's also
acquiring an asset
so you'd have to take the entire value
of ukraine
right and add it to russia
now i don't know what's what's the value
of the entire gdp of ukraine i don't
know let's say it's
a trillion dollars
who knows
let's say it's a trillion dollars
he gets a trillion dollars
right if you don't own ukraine and then
you do
you gained a trillion dollars
but
is it an asset
that is a cash positive or cash negative
it's a valuable asset but does it
produce more cash
than it uses because it's going to be
expensive to hold it
and occupying army is really expensive
so
why don't we produce that number
because there are two possibilities i
can think of that you know are likely to
come out of that one possibility is that
it's wildly unprofitable
wouldn't you like to know that
and wouldn't you like to remind putin of
that
and wouldn't you like his oligarchs who
do have
some control
over things allegedly we i don't know
exactly how that works but you think the
oligarchs
need to be a little bit happy
for putin to be safe would you buy that
even though putin is strongly in control
don't you think he sort of needs to keep
the oligarchs on his side so they don't
gang up against him i think so
so
supposedly the west came up with an
economic
um projection
as said the gdp of russia
will lose x trillions of dollars
and you oligarchs are likely to see your
fortunes go down by 20 percent
now some oligarchs will make money you
some some won't write because it's never
it's never even
but suppose you said to the oligarchs
well this looks like a twenty to fifty
percent hit to your uh assets
and your income
and there's no upside
because that might be that might be the
case
or
it could go it could go grossly the
other way
you could do the economic analysis and
find out that it's a no-brainer
that that putin really really comes out
ahead if he gets ukraine in which case
war is guaranteed
now i tweeted yesterday a map and this
is a few years old but i think it still
worked a map of all the pipelines
from russia
that cross through ukraine
i kind of had this simple idea in my
mind there were one or two pipelines
it turns out ukraine is just
crisscrossed
with pipelines
ukraine is practically a pipeline itself
there's so many russian pipelines in
different you know cobweb ways through
the country to get to different places
so once you see the map
that russia russia is completely
dependent
on ukraine as its distribution
once you see that map
you know putin's going to take ukraine
until i saw the map i actually thought
he wouldn't do it
and then i saw the map i was like oh
that's way too big of a strategic risk
to have your pipelines in other people's
country there's no way he's going to put
up with that in the long run
for business purposes which are also
strategic
oh yeah on locals somebody's publishing
the uh the map right now
so if you get a chance google that once
you see the map of the pipelines you
know that you know that putin's going to
take ukraine
because for purely business reasons
you can't have your competitors
or enemies
control that much of your distribution
you just can't do that
so i think from an economic perspective
this is a no-brainer for putin and he
could put a trillion dollars into this
and come out ahead
what do you think if i put a price tag
on it of a trillion dollars
do you think he comes out ahead
because i think he does
i think he does without running any
numbers
i think he would make more than a
trillion dollars in the long term
but he would also protect himself from
an extreme downside
which is the pipelines get attacked and
destroyed
yeah ukraine is also a breadbasket and
that's going to matter as well right
so at this point
if you follow the money
it does seem to me that it's inevitable
that russia will have to control ukraine
one way or another
either indirectly or directly
and then i ask this question which
military which military and or other
kinds of uh businesses
would gain if there's an attack
so if russia attacks we expect
energy prices to spike
and although there won't be more energy
produced you know quickly in the short
run
all the energy that's there
the companies that produced it
get to charge more
for doing the same job
so they make a windfall profit
for anybody who's competing with russia
as an energy source
what about the companies that make the
the big tankers that carry the natural
gas
well if the pipelines from russia are at
risk there's going to be have to have to
be a lot of shipping in in the short run
shipping in of gas
probably american gas and from other
places
uh the lpg and who makes
who makes a profit from that
are you concerned that they're gigantic
energy companies that would make a huge
profit if war breaks out
because don't those gigantic energy
companies have a lot of influence on the
government
because lobbyists
it's starting to look
i'm not i'm not going to say this as a
fact
it's looking like we're inviting them in
and what would it look like if biden
really wanted them to attack
suppose he wanted it
what would that look like
well it would look like this the first
thing you do is assign vice president
harris to the job of preventing it
am i right
if you're russia and you see that
tijeras has been assigned to prevent war
what would you think about the united
states's uh
interest in avoiding war
i'm not joking you would think they're
not serious about it am i right
because you could think of a lot of
people you could send to to do this job
that russia would take seriously
but this is the only one they would
so it's almost as if we're signaling to
them we want you to invade
here's another hint
why do we insist on applying the
sanctions after invasion
when ukraine itself is saying uh could
you put those sanctions on now and maybe
it will deter them
and we say no no no it's after the
invasion we'll put them on when it's too
late
doesn't that sound a lot like maybe we
want them to invade
because if you have the option of
preventing it
and you don't do it
while you have the option
that kind of means you want them to
evade
am i going too far with that
here's another one
don't negotiate with russia seriously
when you've heard of the back and forth
between russia and the united states
does it sound like we did that seriously
because it doesn't to me
we should have at least said you know
your security your security concerns are
valid
how can we work together so that we're
less afraid of you and you're less
afraid of us
but i don't even think the conversation
happened now it could be that there's so
much distrust it was a waste of time
maybe
but
if you're if you're putting together the
hints right so harris is in charge of
stopping the war which looks like we're
not trying
we're going to apply the sanctions after
invasion
which looks like we're not trying to
avoid it
um we're we're not even negotiating
seriously in my opinion i think you'd
have to be in the room to know for sure
but it doesn't look serious
like nobody's even suggested any kind of
accommodation for anything
and then we're actively creating these
alternative channels for delivering gas
to europe
aren't we
to me it looks like we want them to
invade
so that we can
essentially clamp down on russia as a
provider of energy
and how much does the united states love
ukraine
as an independent country
i feel like ukraine is just an expensive
pain in the ass
and would we be worse off if russia
owned the whole thing outright
i mean i'm not saying i want that to
happen
but if you're doing the cold
calculations of war
you have to ask yourself
does it make any difference
now part of the reason i understand
strategically is that russia doesn't
want missiles and missile defenses right
on their doorstep but does any of that
stuff matter anymore
can't can't russia destroy us and we can
destroy them if we wanted to there's
nothing anybody could do to stop any of
that is there
so i'm not even sure that any of that
missiles on the doorstep made any
difference really
you don't want
russia to be desperate
that's true
all right
colonel jack jacobs was on a
show i don't don't know which new show
was
but he was saying that uh suppose you
were russia and you just wanted to make
a trillion dollars without working
how would you do it
you would buy a stock in a bunch of
energy companies just on the stock
market
and then you would threaten war with
ukraine
and then the value of those stock
energy companies would go up
and then you sell it
and then you say oh we're pulling back
and then the end the energy prices go
down
but you've already sold so you buy them
again and then you threaten again and
then the energy prices go up
and you sell it again
and
you can short the dow
and go long
long means buying and short means you
make money if it goes down
you could actually if you were russia
you could actually invest in the stock
market and then make it move the way you
want by where you put your army
so r so russia could have extracted a
trillion dollars out of our system
just by threatening
they may have already paid for the war
that's right
if there's no evidence that they did
this by the way but if they did this if
they invested
before they moved their military assets
in other words having insider
information because only they knew what
they were going to do
they may have already paid for the war
they may have made a trillion dollars in
stock gains already
paid for the war
possible
i mean it's unlikely but
it's weird that it's possible
all right
um
and that
is what i wanted to say today
so
given the follow the money scenario
and given that we haven't done an
economic
cost and by the way this is more
evidence that we want them to attack
if we didn't want them to attack don't
you think the united states would have
created a financial
estimate of how expensive it would be
because it's obvious isn't it
i mean i don't think we've ever done it
for any other war
but as soon as i say it it's kind of
obvious isn't it am i wrong am i wrong
that that's just an obvious play
just do the math
tell russia how expensive it's going to
be
now i'm seeing some people say that the
money doesn't
matter and that there are other other
issues
but i would argue this if the other
issue is
national defense
the money makes more difference than
anything
you know being profitable is definitely
the thing that keeps you the safest just
being profitable
but could there be other things such as
national pride or
that sort of thing yes
but i'll bet they don't overcome the
economic things you know the reason that
follow the money
is so predictive
is because it always works
you know if follow the money didn't
always work it wouldn't be the most
common thing that people say
right well i suppose it could be but you
know it does work
and i believe that and as i've often
said follow the money works even if the
people
who are making the decisions aren't
thinking that way
people automatically go where the money
goes
even if their brain is saying well i'm
doing this for national pride or some
other reason
they still go where the money goes
and it's not a coincidence
money is just too powerful it just drags
you wherever it is
boo the cat i'm taking her into the vet
again she's not doing well
but so this week i'll take her in again
uh have i noticed tons of ads for green
technology not really
but i'll look for it
did you see the um gulfstream that
arrived in ottawa and then flew to
washington dc
well i don't know what you're implying
by that i saw a story about that but i
didn't know what the implication was
supposed to be
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen is all i
have to say about the news
today um
how does the fear frame filter work on
ukraine
well
if i were going to try to stop
a war
i would be using fear persuasion
to scare the soul the russian soldiers
themselves because they don't know what
kind of a
killing field they're walking into
so you want to you want to lower the
morale of the russian troops
which you don't imagine would be that
high to begin with because they're
attacking other russians basically you
know in the the ukraine russia thing is
such a brother cousin situation that
they've
how could you have good let me ask you
this
if a civil war broke out in the united
states and again i'll just pick a state
and uh you know let's say florida was
the breakaway state
how much morale would u.s troops have to
go in and shoot floridians
am i right
like you're a soldier in the u.s army
and you've been ordered to go shoot
citizens in florida
are you going to do it even if they're a
breakaway
revolutionary state are you going to do
it i don't think so
so i think that putin has a real morale
problem
and i think you can make it worse
by using fear persuasion so to first of
all
tell the russian soldiers if you can get
to him and by the way
can you get to him
do you suspect that even though russia
controls information you know
aggressively do you suspect that the
average soldier
just can't get information from the
outside world
because maybe they can't
maybe they can't
well if they can it seems like we could
get to them i would imagine there's some
way to do it but
they should they should have images in
the in their heads of just being mowed
down when they cross the border
that they should think of it like the
normandy landing
like it's just going to be bullets the
arrow will be thick with bullets
from ukrainian guns
and they should think about that long
and hard and they should think that even
if they survived all they got to do was
kill their own cousins
right
all right the bad news is you might get
killed or disabled for life
but
that's if you fail
if you're successful you get to kill
people you didn't want to kill who they
were basically your family members
i can't imagine that morel would be any
lower
but if we could lower it some more that
might be useful
yeah russian soldiers are not allowed to
have smartphones i would assume that's
the case but it doesn't mean they don't
know anybody who has one
there's there's got to be information
coming in from other sources
maybe not well enough to change anything
wouldn't a ukraine invasion help china
would it
china is very anti-war
uh because it's just never good for
business i i feel as if china would be
opposed to that war although you can
imagine it would give them cover for
taiwan it would keep us busy
you know keep two armies it would make a
lot of military poorer i guess
because they'd spend a lot of money
there uh yeah i mean
i i feel as though china's
policy of non-involvement in this stuff
is kind of brilliant
it's kind of brilliant
um
maybe putin is really standing up to
china i don't see that happening
get off the weed
yeah the belton road right china needs
to be friends with everybody to build
out their belt and road so china's
takeover the world strategy is commerce
to make everybody dependent on them for
commerce
which is a good strategy
all right that's all i got left i will
say goodbye to you on youtube
and
we'll talk to you later
