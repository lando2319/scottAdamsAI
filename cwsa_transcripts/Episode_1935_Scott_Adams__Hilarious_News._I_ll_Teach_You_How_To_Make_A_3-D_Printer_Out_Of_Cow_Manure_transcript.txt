welcome to the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
there is no finer thing that has ever
happened in the history of humankind and
before
in fact many of the animals had no
sipping from coffee cups whatsoever so
we can feel sorry for them but let's not
bring that Downer into our thinking
instead let's raise it up because the
news is funny and fun today well most of
it we're going to ignore the bad stuff
but if you'd like to take it up for
uh an experience that might be the peak
experience of your entire life all you
need is a cup or a mug or a glass of
tanker Chelsea stand they can't teen
Joker flaska vessel of any Cayenne fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing that makes everything better
everything
it's called the simultaneous
go
yeah yeah that was good
well the most important story of the day
is that so folks in India have figured
out how to use cow dung
to make uh plaster and Bricks
and if you say to yourself well
that doesn't sound like a good idea I
don't want my house made of cow dung you
would be wrong because it turns out that
if you mix it with some ordinary
materials
not only does it become solid and good
for building and has been used for I
guess it's been used for many years in
some parts of the world but better than
that apparently it's a superior
insulation you can actually lower the
indoor temperature by seven degrees just
by using these cow dung bricks pretty
good right
now have you ever seen a 3D printer that
builds houses have you ever seen a video
of that they'll bring in usually like a
big platform that they put you know
around where the house will be and then
the 3D printer moves along the you know
the arms and it just builds the walls up
as you go
I'm thinking this might be an
opportunity to build a 3D printer and a
cows
so all you do is you strap a feedback to
the cow's your mouth
and then you would lift the cow up on
some kind of a you know support thing
and you would just hover it over the
part of the wall
where you want to you know build the
next part of the wall and the cat would
just you know eat and then they'll do
its business but you got to have it
lined up just right
so the cowardung comes right into a
little form that would form a brick and
then I guess you probably Tamp it down a
little bit but I think you could
actually build
3D printer out of a cow
it wouldn't be fast
but it would get the job done just the
sort of thing you need for a third world
country
3D printer
yeah you want one I know you want one
well speaking of cow let's talk
about Adam Schiff
now I just want to put a mental picture
can we do a little mental
little mental activity here you'll do a
little mental exercise I want you all
play along I'm going to give you two
images
imagine the two images separately
and then I'm going to ask you to in your
mind merge the two images you know like
if you're a cross-eyed there'll be two
separate images and then I'm going to
ask you to bring them together in your
mind all right first one is a full moon
just get a picture of the Moon with all
of this you know crevices and craters
and stuff like a really good Moon
picture now separately separately split
screen your brain and over on the right
imagine your dog's ass
but you're looking at it from like ass
level you know directly from the back so
now now imagine the dog's ass on on one
side now imagine the moon on the other
side now in your mind merge the moon and
the dog's ass
and what does it look like
Adam Schiff
yeah if you if you merge a moon
and a dog's ass
take a look at Adam Schiff
yeah it's not funny now but wait till
you look at them the next time you see
Adam Schiff ask yourself if he doesn't
look like the combination of a moon and
a dog's ass
he does
I'm just saying
which is not deeply important to my
point but I thought it was necessary
um so it turns out that McCarthy now
that he's uh you know speaker of the
house or will be he's going to remove
from committees uh Adam Schiff and
swalwell and Omar so Omar is getting
kicked for being anti-semitic says
McCarthy uh Adam Schiff has been removed
for being a confirmed liar
and it's funny because I think it is
confirmed
because he said some things in public
and then when he was put under oath
according to McCarthy when he was put
under oath he said no no I didn't see
any evidence in that in that skiff at
all
or something like that and then swalwell
I think McCarthy's point which is clever
if he swallow would not be able to get
security clearance in the private sector
because of his you know his association
with a Chinese spy
so that the private sector wouldn't be
able to even give him security clearance
so McCarthy says
if if the private sector wouldn't give
him security clearance
why is the government doing it
now remember this point
when we get to a story I'm going to talk
about uh
uh with Brett Weinstein all right so now
doesn't it seem to you as if giving
security clearance
uh to swallow
sounds exactly like the opposite of what
you would do if you were trying to do a
good job for your country
doesn't it
sounds like why would you even consider
that like that's not even the top of
thousand things you would do if you
actually wanted to protect your country
so it looks like a little bit like
opposite of what would be smart right
just just remember this is one example
of something that looks that just looks
opposite of what's smart
and maybe there's a reason for that
we'll talk about that a little bit
all right and so I'm I'm fully in favor
of removing these folks from the
Committees I guess that's what happens
when you're in power you get to do that
and I think I think the reasons the
reasons stated are completely solid
would you agree
because I wouldn't I wouldn't
necessarily be on board with this if he
were making up reasons right if all if
the only argument was we don't want
these darn Democrats on our committee
then I'd say whoa that's that's not how
this works you you probably should have
a Democrat on your committee but the
problem with these characters is not
that they're too Democrat
they did some pretty specific things
that
you know you should consider them for
being disqualified
so good job for her McCarthy on taking
care of that you know directly and not
not messing around with that
another favorite story apparently a
prankster
pretended to be Francis macron the head
of France and he actually got a phone
call through to uh the head of Poland
and he had a long conversation with him
pretending to be the president of France
now the actual conversation is not
terribly important like they were
talking about uh Warwick you know
whether he wanted war with Russia and
stuff so it's got a ridiculous
conversation but here's here's my here's
the best part of the story
uh how do you get through to the
president of Poland
how'd he do that
no you want to know how he pulled that
off
can anybody do that
can I could I could I uh place a call
from my own phone
maybe it was a I don't know was it a
block number or a private number or
something so maybe he called into the
switchboard
probably called into the switchboard and
said hello are you in president macron
can you forward me to the president of
Poland
and then like somebody forwarded him to
the president like how exactly did that
happen don't you feel like you need a
little extra information on this story
how do you get through and could
somebody do that to Biden
like is it is this a poll and specific
thing because why would you even think
to try it
like who would even think that that that
could work
like I wouldn't even try that prank
yeah I wouldn't do it anyway but I
wouldn't think there was any chance it
would work now if you said getting
through to a senator
or a representative I would say yeah you
could probably do that I'll bet you
could get through to a member of
Congress
but the president the sitting president
you could just call the president
what's going on here
all right well that's hilarious no
matter what the real story is
uh here's another funny story and so one
of the competitors to Twitter I guess is
a site called Mastodon
and apparently a lot of journalists and
left-leaning people you know said oh we
can't handle this Twitter under Elon
Musk we're all going to escape we're
going to go over to Mastodon
so how do you think that's working out
for them over at Mastodon
there is a hilarious story on the Fox
News site now of course Fox
you know likes to dunk on on the left so
there's a little bit of dunking going on
so I'm not going to claim that this is
you know an unbiased reporting or
anything but it is funny
so I'm just going to tell you about it
because it's funny all right this is
from Fox News site so it says that
Mastodon it's a alternative to Twitter
so it's where all these Lefty
journalists are going but here's here's
what's happened according to them as
more journalists moved on to the site
however there were more reports of
blocking attacking and outright Banning
of users over political issues
so they they went there and turns out
every place is going to be the same but
here's here's the best part in one case
former slate podcaster now you'd have to
know slate is very left-leaning right so
this is a lefty podcaster Mike peska was
suspended from the popular Mastodon
server for a verified journalist
there's some technical thing that you
get
mastodon has a weird architecture so
forget about the details but he got in
trouble on the site and got negative
consequences because he pointed to he
linked to a story in the New York Times
and the New York Times story was on the
negative consequences according to the
reporting of puberty blockers on
children
and although it was in the New York
Times
and he was a left-leaning journalist
pointing to a left-leaning paper of
record for the left
he got in trouble from somebody who was
even farther left transgender blogger
Parker Malloy attacked peska and
complained that the quote anti-trans
content in the New York Times was not
removed from the network from Macedon uh
and then according to the New York Times
Pesco was soon informed that quote he
had been suspended for referring to miss
Malloy as a quote activist which was
dismissive
he got kicked off a mastodon
for calling an activist an activist
oh come on that's funny
but so the left realized that if if they
go someplace that is mostly just
themselves
that they don't become peaceful they
attack each other
do you know who knew that would happen
everybody on the right
a hundred percent of people on the right
know that they can't turn off the uh you
can't turn off the victim at Attack Mode
right
so the people on the left have an
operating system
that is the way you win is to frame
yourself as the biggest victim
that doesn't go away just because the
Republicans are somewhere else you can't
turn that off that they will
suddenly go from We're victims of
Republicans do well I guess we're
victims of these guys too I guess we're
just victims of these these activists
who are more activists than we are
they're a little bit more left than us
that are attacking us
so maybe just maybe the people who left
Twitter for Macedon learned a valuable
lesson about human nature
it doesn't change when you change when
you change platforms your human nature
still the same
so I think the left is going to need to
be near Republicans
do you know why
is the left
need to be near Republicans
well one protection
who's going to protect them
and two so they have some reason to be
evil and mean and victims and it makes
more sense to them because they they
have an other to blame
all right
stabi if you saw this coming
um have you ever seen an example where a
joke
turns into reality
and you watch it in slow motion as it's
happening and you're saying well that's
not really going to go from a joke
to actually something happening in the
real world
and then
slowly it does and the whole time you're
like
am I really watching that here's an
example
uh art there's an article by Ross Barkin
uh MSN so MSN ran this story and I guess
it was in the intelligent Intelligencer
uh originally
and the option is uh
Democrats have some solid options if
Biden doesn't run in 2024.
so if it's not Biden those Democrats
that they have a strong bench
and uh the person who has called out as
one of the strongest on the Democrat
bench was John fetterman
John Federman
is being talked about as your next
president
now
that started as a joke right
I I'm probably not the first or only
person who said it as a joke
but fetterman could beat Trump
fedman could be any any Republican do
you know why
because if fetterman runs
there won't be anything to talk about on
the candidate you'll just talk about
policies
because they'll just say well he'll just
rubber stamp Democrat policies so the
Democrats say kind of doesn't matter who
it is
you might as well have somebody who
doesn't have like a lot of baggage
except the most obvious baggage and
apparently that didn't stop him from
becoming a senator
so if they know that that doesn't matter
just run the guy who's more like he's
like a brand ambassador he's not even
like a politician right
right
he's more like a a symbol of their
policies and that's all they need
they could actually win
with it with they won with Joe Biden
hiding in the basement
all they have to do is take fetterman
and hide him in the basement
there's no reason to think that won't
work in the actual real world even the
Democrats know that would work
that would really work
like how could that be more absurd
I don't know there's nothing you say
about that that can like take it to the
exaggeration level it's the ultimate
exaggeration like just by itself this
could not be crazier
now of course the argument
there there was a little bit of meat on
the argument that he appealed to I guess
uh white male voters or something you
know blue-collar workers so that makes
sense and then the argument is that he
would be recovered from his stroke so
you know it's not going to be like the
senate race and that's a fair statement
he might actually recover from his broke
and he might appeal to a certain segment
that would give Trump some trouble
it's it's actually in the realm of
something that could happen
well
um if you're trying to keep up on the
Dilbert website that's been down since
Friday
when I tell you uh it got hacked
I don't know the details I mean I assume
they know it got hacked but I'm not even
sure that's true
uh apparently it's just like removed
from the DNS it's like it didn't exist
and the last I knew the the admins were
locked out from some key functions so it
might not even be fixable
and when I say not fixable I mean they
might have to start from scratch as in
you can't even do a backup
right because in order to access the
backup you'd have to have access to all
the you know parts of the system and
they don't
so they might have to just erase it just
erase the whole thing and start
over
[Laughter]
now
I don't know if that has anything to do
with me
because I'm at this moment I'm the only
controversial artist because the other
Comics were affected too it wasn't just
Dilbert it was a range of I don't know
100 different Comics that are all part
of the same
syndication process so
yeah I don't I doubt it was because of
ESG or anything like that I doubt it I
feel like it was probably just general
 I'm not necessarily aimed at me
does anybody think it was aimed at me
let's let's test your conspiracy
theorizing because I don't I don't think
it was aimed at me
yeah I'm getting a lot of yeses I won't
dismiss that right so so I won't tell
you you're crazy
because if you think it was aimed at me
that's not crazy
it just would be sort of an indirect way
to do it
because you know the site will be down
for a few days cost me it's going to
cost me a quarter of my income for the
month
right so it's really expensive quarter
of my income from that Source just that
source
it's pretty expensive
so we'll see
uh you know the trouble is it wouldn't
stop me from talking about ESG or
anything else
so it's not going to stop me so it
wouldn't be really an effective way to
go about it
all right
um
let's see
I'm not going to talk about mass
shootings everybody okay with that
I just want to get let me just uh
take the temperature in the room you're
all okay with that right I just want to
make sure everybody's on the same page
I was just not going to talk about the
mass shootings just period
um
and if you want to know about that stuff
there's there are new sources for that
it's just not going to be part of what I
do
all right
um
there's a new Ivermectin news
I forgot to just won't die it's like
it's like every day there's some new
thing so now there's a doctor lawsuit
against the FDA saying that the FDA
prevented them from using it off label
which is separate from saying whether it
worked or it didn't work so this is not
a conversation about whether Ivermectin
works or doesn't work it's all your
conversation about whether doctors
should have the right to take a chance
if they think the risk reward you know
situation looks right
and the FDA recommended against it but
now the fda's defenses we didn't tell
you you couldn't use it
we we just recommended against it
does that feel like a good argument to
you
because
wouldn't a doctor be totally chilled out
um you'd be frozen out of the process if
you thought the FDA said don't do it
because if something goes wrong
and it could go wrong two different ways
it could go wrong because you gave
somebody Ivermectin and something bad
happened and then if they Sue it's not
just an ordinary case of off-label use
it would be a case of off-label use when
the FDA told you directly don't do it
so it's going to look like it has some
extra responsibility right so to me I
think the doctors have the better
argument
I think the doctors have the better
argument I do believe I I do agree with
the FDA that the way they worded it was
not a legal requirement
they worded it as a strong
recommendation
I don't think that's strong that's not a
good argument because they're the FDA
right the FDA isn't like a Twitter user
who's just got an opinion their opinion
moves things
and it had to have a chilling effect on
the doctors
so we'll see how that goes uh I don't
like to see anybody get sued if they
were doing their best so maybe you know
maybe this is not good maybe everybody
was just doing their best and got it
wrong I don't know there's still a lot
of questions of that we'll talk about
that a little more
have you heard of a thing called
grounding
where you walk Barefoot on
Outdoors on dirt and grass is supposed
to immediately fix your blood pressure
and your system and everything
all right well there's there's a video
going around
and I'm going to test your critical
thinking skills right so we're going to
test if you can analyze the news
properly
and if you have the right analytical
tools to see a news story for what it is
so there's a video go around where
there's a doctor giving a demonstration
on video of grounding he's got an
elderly patient
and he takes her blood and then shows
you on the screen the the red blood
cells and he says well they're all
bunched up
kind of kind of looking inactive and
bunched up they says after 10 minutes of
walking Outdoors we're gonna we're gonna
test her blood again and they test it
again and it's like way different like
the red blood cells are looking all
active and vital and they're not on top
of each other it really looks like they
they do a good job for you
so he's so he uses this to demonstrate
that 10 minutes of walking around
Barefoot Outdoors
changed her situation
now
how many problems do you see with this
I'll do the easy ones for you and then
we'll see if you get the hard ones the
easy one is this why would you trust a
video on on Twitter about anything
don't don't trust a video on Twitter of
a doctor doing a demonstration
the the other things you see on Twitter
of the doctors that have all this uh
these arteries that are all blocked have
you seen those videos and they're
showing like doctors actually taking
coagulated stuff out of deceased
people's arteries
should you believe that one there are
lots and lots of them should you leave
those no no everything that's a doctor
giving a demonstration on video
zero credibility
zero credibility so that's your first
test if you thought that because it was
a real doctor
and I'm sure it is a real doctor and
that the doctor believed what they were
doing I think he does can't tell
and then you saw it on video
that gives you zero credibility
right if you're if you're being a an
adult
sophisticated consumer of medical news
that should be that should be rated at
zero
now that doesn't mean there's nothing to
the process I'm just saying that video
on Twitter is your lowest level of
credibility in the world because there's
going to be video on both sides of
everything
how are you going to pick all right
here's some more things that are wrong
with it
did they control for the uh yeah right
it wasn't a it wasn't of course a
randomized control test but let's just
do the obvious stuff
what were the other things that could
have caused the differences in the
slides
number one
she walked outside in the sun
don't we already know that being in the
sun changes your metabolism
I don't know if it changes in that
particular way but you haven't
controlled for Sun
isn't that kind of big and temperature
you haven't controlled for temperature
you haven't controlled for any
difference in somebody mentioned
hydration
uh what if she had a big drink of water
before she went outside
could change apparently that can change
it too
somebody somebody told me that uh they
could get that same effect by how they
showed the sample and whether I think
it's whether you squeeze the glass
plates on the blood sample enough if you
don't squeeze them they look like blood
cells are stacked up if you squeeze them
you can see them separate
so I don't know if there's anything to
that but apparently the way you decide
to prepare the slide could give you a
different result
all right what what about the fact that
she was walking versus sitting
don't you think that walking around also
changes your Chemistry in a positive way
we already know that
don't you think that walking changed her
breathing
we already know that walking around
lowers your blood pressure
walking around is the number one thing
that's recommended for lowering your
blood pressure just by itself with shoes
so if she goes and walks around without
shoes she's already doing the number one
thing that is recommended for lowering
your blood pressure
and then what's the Barefoot got to do
with anything
right
now yeah and then there's a good point
we were not designed for a setting if
all you did is measure somebody had been
sitting versus somebody who'd been
standing and walking there should be a
difference
what about that that being in a doctor's
office and makes you automatically tense
and probably changes your Chemistry you
walk outside you're comfortable here's
another one
the video of the woman walking outside
showed looked like a female assistant or
maybe a family member who was if I
remember correctly I think they were
maybe one was holding the arm of the
other you know keeping her up
human touch
human touch changes your oxytocin
immediately
is this a woman who hadn't been touched
by because she was an elderly woman is
this a woman who hadn't really been
touched by any anybody all day and she
finally had some human contact
I don't know there's so many things
going on Placebo placebo effect do you
think that the woman knew she was part
of a study
of course she did There's No Control
so literally
how many how many reasons did I give you
yeah sample size of one how many uh
reasons did I give you not to trust this
video
six
eight I didn't count them all
the Hawthorne effect yeah
right so uh ask yourself ask yourself
how many of those you spotted yourself I
didn't get them all some other people
noted a few that I missed uh and just
tell yourself that this is a good
exercise
like the if you could do what I just did
your ability to consume news and know
what is or what isn't would be
really good
um this is so this is a good exercise
my personal opinion is I don't know that
there's any science to this so-called
grounding thing or walking around
Barefoot I don't know
I don't want to get my feet dirty so
probably won't try it
and maybe I will when it's warmer
all right there's a new evidence that
shows that the obese the fatter you are
the more you spread covet
is there anybody who didn't already
assume that was true
anybody
didn't you all sort of just intuitively
think that the bigger you are the more
you're going to spread coveted
and and I would add uh taller as well
because I think if your lung capacity is
bigger
and especially if you're overweight
maybe you have to maybe your breathing
is a little labored
wouldn't there be a higher volume of
just air coming out of a bigger human
right and and if you were overweight I
don't know if there's more chance you'd
have it but there's more chance you'd
give it
so I'm going to confess something that
I've been doing since the pandemic
I have intentionally avoided being close
to large people
large in all the senses not just uh
weight but large like if somebody's six
foot six I kept my distance
for that exact reason and if I was
around a kid
I'd think well you know there's not much
air coming out of a kid
so you know I don't want to get into the
argument of you know the whole thing was
nothing to be afraid of and why are you
afraid of big people you coward and did
you believe all the all the bad things
that people told you the government I
don't want to get into that I'm just
saying that as I was in the fog of war
and I was assessing my personal risks
without the benefit of good data
I said to myself well the easiest thing
I could do is just not be close to
really big people who breathe a lot it
turns out that was right now I might not
have been right for the right reason you
know they they didn't say specifically
it's because of the larger you know lung
capacity
I don't know why but you know I guess my
my sense common sense if you want to
call that doesn't really exist but uh
at least my instincts took me in the
right direction is there anybody anybody
who did the same is there anybody who
felt less comfortable
around big people
anybody else have that
I'm seeing a bunch of yeses okay so it
wasn't just me
yeah
a bunch of yeses okay
interesting
yeah
all right
um
we'll be finding out new things forever
I think
all right here's uh notes from the
simulation
there's a clinic then 2017 I guess the
Secretary of Levine
uh it's a some kind of a gender Clinic
where they do the top and bottom
surgeries on people and secretary Levine
s in 2017 asked the uh the co-founder
um
for literature to support gender
confirmation surgery protocols and
minors
so secretary Levine you know wondered if
um
there were there was some data to
recommend it I guess
and uh the response was a quote hi
Rachel I'm not aware of existing
literature but it is certainly happening
in other words the person doing the
surgeries or in charge of facility doing
it
confirmed that it was happening but was
not aware of any
um
supporting science
all right now here's the thing
I had have you noticed that I haven't
weighed in on this topic
is that been like really obvious to you
that I've avoided this because most of
you are all over it right
now you know that I'm more trans
friendly than just about every one of
you
don't you so just just establishing the
base
yeah I'm way more trans and lb gtq
friendly than maybe my audience
now
here's my problem with the gender
reassignment surgeries for minors
how do you square
parental rights
with your opinion of what's better for
somebody else's kid
now if you ask me are all those parents
hold on hold on if you ask me are those
parents making a good decision for their
children I'd say you could almost be
sure
that some of them are not
I don't know what percentage would you
agree with that statement
if there are a lot of people involved
and it's a human decision and people are
all different there certainly are cases
where it's good for the child in my
opinion and certainly cases where it's
bad for the child now I'm going to
Define Good Very narrowly good meaning
that that child will grow up to an adult
and be glad all of their life that they
made the decision now that's different
from your opinion of what's good for
them you might have an opinion that well
no they just think they're happy but
they would have been much happier or
some other way but that's that's your
opinion people get to have their own
opinion of what work for them and what
makes them happy so your opinion of
somebody else's happiness irrelevant
right it's only their opinion so what do
you agree with the following statement
that although we don't know what
percentage goes either way
clearly there are people who where the
parents are making a mistake and clearly
there are cases where that child will
grow up and be glad their parents
supported it
would you agree that in both cases that
but we don't know if it's one percent
and 99 or 99 and one percent I don't
have any data to suggest which way it
leans even
right
so
I have a I have an ethical sort of moral
block here
because I have a really really strong
feeling that I don't want the government
telling a parent what to do with their
own children
and I know you agree with me on that
generally speaking you agree
but you do make the exception for most
of you do for abortion don't you that
would be a case where you say whoa whoa
parent doesn't get to decide that
all right you can decide what haircut
your kid gets but you can't decide to
eliminate them you know according to the
conservative view of what a fetus is
so
so where do you draw the line
right how many parents are causing
permanent damage to their kids every day
just through normal stuff
how many alcoholic parents are there
Lots do you think they should have their
kids taken away
you can make an argument for it
how many how many parents are let's say
toxic narcissists who are just like
destroying the mental health of their
kids
a lot a lot do you think their kids
should be taken away
how many have mental health problems and
they're making their kids crazy
should they be taken away
now these are not ex I wouldn't say
these are analogies
I would say this is a consistency test
and if you say this is a different
situation
then that would be a good argument you
could say well all those other examples
you know they're they're different in
some way
but are they are they different
that in all the cases I'm giving the
parents are making a bad decision
hypothetically I'm not saying that it's
a bad decision to you know get the
surgery I'm saying that in some cases it
might be so in other cases it might be a
bad decision to not put the kid up for
adoption
don't you think there are parents who
really should put their kid up for
adoption because they're just ruining
the kid
of course
but do you get to make that decision
it's tough it's tough I I think you lose
no matter which way you go
you just have to decide which way to
lose and that's the only decision you
get so you can lose by knowing that
maybe some children got surgeries that
they will regret that would be losing
you know even if it's not you or your
kid
you still feel it because we're all
responsible for the kids right you'd all
agree with that wouldn't you
that we're not all responsible for every
adult necessarily but we're kind of all
responsible for the kids
not as responsible as the parents but
you know the the backup is just
automatic right
if a kid is homeless
pretty much any parent would say oh well
come here for tonight at least
so we're all the parents of the kids if
their parents don't get it right
but where do you make where do you take
the decision away from the parents I
think that you couldn't have that
standard
so it's a tough one there's no right
answer for this I don't think
all right um
there is a trial did you know that that
The Oath Keepers a so-called uh
right-wing militia group
which is probably accurate probably
right-wing militia group is
pretty close I'm not sure if they would
call themselves that but anyway there's
several of them being they're in a
criminal trial and I guess it's going to
the jury now
and so far the evidence against them
as their defense attorney says
no evidence was provided that they
planned to storm the capital
no evidence that they plan to breach the
Rotunda
and no evidence that they plan to stop
or delay this certification of the
elections
they just had a whole they had a whole
trial in which there was no evidence of
either intent
planning or actually doing
I think they did probably enter the
Rotunda but not in terms of any kind of
a plan
this is actually going to the jury
how does it even go to the jury
how does the judge not say
um you know
you didn't actually show any evidence
now I know this is the defense saying
there's no evidence
but I believe the case is being made
like
sort of you know like uh there's enough
suggestion
well I think you need evidence don't you
there there's no person who testified to
it
the prosecution had zero human Witnesses
and zero documentation
now maybe I'm wrong I may be you know
maybe I don't have some details right
but that's what the defense attorney
says the defense attorney says there's
no human or written evidence
for the allegations none
there's only sort of indirect suggestion
that these are the kind of people and a
thing happened well you put the kind of
people with the thing probably the kind
of people intended to do the thing
that's basically the that's their
argument
now they'll probably still get convicted
don't you think
if they do you're convicted
Trump's elected
I think Trump just gets elected because
there will be people who want Trump
elected just to pardon the January 6
people
and that's not a bad argument
if you said to me you're a single issue
voter I say fentanyl first but secondly
would be pardons
because I think I think the January 6
was the biggest
the response to January 6 is the biggest
threat to democracy I've ever seen
January 6 itself looks like a threat to
the other side because they still
believe the following two things
imagine believing this
imagine believing that Republicans stage
insurrections without bringing out their
weapons
but my favorite
that that I'm the only one who's ever
said this correct me if I'm wrong tell
me if you've ever heard anybody else say
this
we know from the messages the text
messages on January 6 that for sure
Don Jr was not aware of any plans for an
insurrection
who believes
that Trump planned an Insurrection and
Don Jr didn't know about it
I mean really
there's somebody who actually believes
that now the only way that that that I
think that we could get to this point is
that nobody asked that obvious question
there is no scenario in our reality in
which father Trump
throws a coup of the United States and
Don Jr didn't get wind of it
I mean seriously oh Dan bongino said
that okay
yeah bongino is usually on he's on the
good stuff
but
but shouldn't that be the whole argument
but here's what's happening I don't know
if you notice do you remember how the
Russia collusion thing morphed it
started down as I I think uh I think
Trump and Putin probably colluded maybe
during that time when you know they told
The Interpreter to leave or whatever it
was uh maybe they've colluded and really
Putin is is running Trump as president
so that's how it started do you remember
how it ended
it ended with all of those allegations
are true because something totally
different is true
that manafort did some things on his own
they were sketchy had nothing to do with
the original claim and the Russian troll
Farm did some insignificant ads so small
that could not have possibly made any
difference and some of them were
anti-trump and some of them were
anti-hillary mostly anti-hillary
that's it and and still still the uh the
Democrats say it was proven
the Russia collusion was proven they
allowed themselves to drift from Trump
was involved to completely other people
were involved in other things
uh-uh right
that's happening with the January 6th
stuff
already the January 6th stuff has
evolved from
Trump planned with the with all these
bad people he planned an actual
overthrow of the country
that has already been was debunked
largely by the January 6 hearings
themselves but now it's all the way and
tell me if you've seen it yet it's all
the way to he could have done more to
stop it
have you seen it yet
and and they're going to turn he could
have done more to stop at and to I told
you he planned an insurrection
and they're not even close
because everybody involved could have
done more to stop it
somebody said to me you know I I gave
this argument on online well let me let
me actually take you through
um
a Twitter exchange because I think you
can see the whole thing here
all right um
uh
so what this started this way so a Molly
hubby way noted that Larry O'Connor had
made this point on the radio I guess
that uh one of the things that's going
to happen by uh
Twitter
de-platforming one of the things that
happened when Twitter de-platformed
Trump is that you didn't get to be
reminded what his last two tweets were
Trump's last tweets were calling for uh
peace and no violence
and when you take those out of the
public record
because otherwise they would have just
sat there and we would look at them
every day and and you would forget maybe
the timing of it but you say
um I don't get it here it is in his own
words
be peaceful
so isn't that the end of it you know
exactly what he was promoting it's right
here
he said it and he wrote it don't do
anything dangerous in effect
so that would be an important argument
the other side now he's reinstated
and since he was reinstated I had that
same reaction maybe some of you did the
same reaction was whoa I forgot that it
was so obvious that his last tweets were
were where you would want them to be you
know don't be in don't do anything
dangerous
so
so that's that's the thing
um
and then I saw a Twitter user Michael
Stein I guess he's uh on the anti-trump
side of things he said the trouble is
that by the time that Trump tweeted that
it was already too late
to which I say
that's not really the point
the point is that it shows his his frame
of mind
right
the the point is not that he didn't do
as soon enough or good enough
the entire January 6th thing is that he
intended it and this shows clearly that
it was not his intention because he said
it loudly in the middle of the event
if in the middle of the event you say
don't do any don't do any violent stuff
that's your state of mind
it couldn't possibly be that he was
telling people to stand down at the same
time he wanted them to ratchet it up
that wouldn't make sense
so
uh that didn't make sense
um
so then after I said to uh this Twitter
user that it shows his state of mind and
that's that's really the whole argument
um
and then then I noticed that it's
basically this the same path that the
rush collusion took
um and then Michael Stein comes back do
you remember how the Charlottesville uh
fine people hoax once you debunked it
that Trump called you know Nazis fine
people and it's easy to debunk you just
play the whole quote instead of the
edited one it's that easy
do the people say oh I was totally wrong
about this important thing I revised my
opinion when it's totally debunked nope
they go down this well of related things
that what about this what about this and
and until you've removed all their
objections so now I'm seeing the um the
same kind of well happen so then on
Twitter Michael Stein said you know why
didn't Trump call out the National Guard
so we're already we've gone from he
planned an insurrection
to he didn't do enough
and then a specific why didn't he call
out the National Guard and the answer is
why
he tried right yeah it was Authority and
now and here's the context every leader
every leader who had any ability to make
it better that day they all up
that every one of them operated below
their you know the ability which we wish
they had shown so Pelosi didn't do
enough mayor Bowser didn't do enough
Trump didn't do enough
now
why did Trump did not do enough well
something about Authority but I also
suspect he didn't know exactly how bad
it was
like you may have had an opinion that
people were getting roughed up but it
was it was worse than that and I'm not
sure when he knew what right or how or
if he processed it it was really that
bad so those things we don't know
anyway
um so Michael points out that there's so
many indications that Trump was
you know really planning something bad
that day so many how can you ignore all
the the dry Tinder brush around it I
mean it's all if you look at any one
thing sure you could argue that one
thing but if you look at the totality of
the evidence it's very damning for Trump
to which I said
you can't tell the difference between
confirmation and a pile of
of evidence
nobody can I can't you can't scientists
can't
sometimes the law can't I mean if you
have enough time maybe you can sort it
out but from our perspective
a hundred facts that look like well none
of them are confirming anything but
they're all sort of suggestive of this
thing doesn't mean anything
it doesn't mean anything because once
you're convinced something is true you
will see all the evidence in the world
to support your opinion even if it's not
true
so how true something is is unrelated to
how much evidence there is
that that's the part that your head has
trouble holding on
the amount of evidence for a thing is
not related to whether it's true
the quality of evidence is
if you had just one high quality piece
of evidence that's all it take but if
you had
50 reasons
but none of the 50 were like nails it
doesn't mean anything
50 reasons suggesting something doesn't
have any value because you would see 50
reasons in your imagination even if they
didn't exist
um which is which is tough to really
live your life that way and actually
understand that all right I saw a
fascinating debate by uh Brett uh
Weinstein on his Dark Horse podcast
there was some critic who was uh
uh complaining that he had he had sort
of gone too far
and I'll do a bad job of characterizing
both of their opinions but the the thing
that Brad had suggested
is that we should hold as at least a
hypothesis
and this is the important word
hypothesis
and I'll tell you what his hypothesis in
a moment but
it don't make the mistake as critic did
of taking the word hypothesis and then
trying to turn it into but you're saying
and then Brett has to keep correcting
him no
I'm not saying that's proven
saying it's a hypothesis that's you know
worthy of consideration so here's the
hypothesis that Brett says a reasonable
person could agree with
his critic says a reasonable person
could not agree with that because there
are better alternatives
that are much more likely right so
here's what Brett suggested
that there's enough evidence that the
government is doing things obviously the
opposite of what would be good
and that includes uh vaccinating kids
according to Brett vaccinating kids the
evidence shows that's a bad idea
according to Brett and requiring
vaccinations of service people that ends
up just lowering our Readiness but
doesn't seem to get you anything in
return because they're the last people
that need vaccinations they're healthy
and Young
so
so that and other you know I think
there's there are more examples of that
so Brett says how do you explain the
government doing what is clearly and
obviously the opposite of smart
or good for the country
and he says that the one of the things
you can't rule out as a hypothesis is
since our our government is for sale
meaning that if you donate enough you
figure out how to benefit somebody
behind the scenes you you know basically
there's lots of way money influences our
process and nobody nobody disagrees with
that right nobody would disagree with
the notion that money distorts our
process now here's the only thing that
Brett added to the conversation and he
got pushed back from it can you rule out
that some of that money is coming from
external let's say non-friendly sources
unnamed he didn't name any specific ones
except by example and that can we rule
out that they're intentionally
influencing us to do all the wrong
things
to which I say I think that's completely
reasonable and that follows the thing
I've told you forever
that if something can be gained
if something can be gamed you know if
you can hack a system it will be so long
as there's lots of people involved
enough time has passed so people can you
know operate their schemes and there's a
big game there's a big upside to it now
as he points out imagine spending you
know
uh a million dollars
to change how America thinks and and
cause it to decrease its military
Readiness versus how much you'd have to
spend to improve your own military
Readiness to compete with the United
States
one of them is really cheap
why in the world would a adversary such
as China and that's just an example
that's not a specific accusation why
would an adversary
want to spend a hundred billion dollars
building weapons when they could spend
one million dollars buying our Congress
because it wouldn't be that expensive
right
so his critic
responded this way and said no
although it's in I think he allowed that
anything's possible like you can't rule
it down but he said it's far more likely
that what you're seeing with these
things such as required vaccinations for
service people that has more to do with
bureaucracy and inertia and people not
wanting to admit they were wrong and
there's plenty of evidence of the
government especially the military and
this was a good point he goes the
military is literally famous for doing
the least smart thing consistently
I suppose if you he was in the military
I suppose if you were in the military it
really feels that way all right so now
compare these two theories
one
people are uh you know don't want to
admit they're wrong
so they're sticking with their old
recommendations of stuff even though the
data has changed uh the bureaucracy
there's
um and he used the his credit used the
example
that some things in the military don't
get fixed if nobody can get a promotion
for fixing it
and that there are cases where that's
that's clearly the case it's just not
anybody's job
and if they did it wouldn't be
necessarily the thing that got him
promoted
so there's just no incentive to fix
stuff in some cases
that's that's not a bad argument is it
it's not a bad argument now I'm gonna I
think that Brett has the stronger
argument although you can't rank you
know which one's more likely I think
that's a little that gets more to their
opinions and I'll let them have their
opinions on that I don't know how to
rank those but I think that Brett's
point is the stronger one
that if there's an open channel to
influence our government it's
inexpensive and easy to access which it
appears to be it appears easy to access
any country would notice that our
government's for sale
probably all governments are for sale
and why wouldn't they why would they not
be trying to influence us that way
I think that's a strong point
if they're not doing it already you'd
expect that they do it later the best
argument I can give
here's my best argument for why foreign
countries are not necessarily
influencing domestic policy here's the
counter argument
that there's too much domestic money
influencing it the way they want it
say for example
that China wanted us to
drill for Less oil
which would make sense because it would
hurt us
um
they would be competing if they were
trying to bribe our government
hypothetically they would be competing
with bribes from our own energy
companies
don't you think American energy
companies could do a better job of
bribing Americans than a hypothetical uh
Chinese
attempt
yeah
so and then climate change same thing
even if there are external forces trying
to do propaganda
probably are domestic people have the
most money and the most access
so so basically it's a competition of
bribers
and my guess is that foreign bribers are
at a great disadvantage compared to
compared to domestic bribers
so I don't see this this loot I don't
see our system as something that's
trying to be you know a democratic you
know Republic Fair system and there's a
little bit of
Chinese or some other country
influencing it I see it as a competition
of money
which is such a big competition of money
that unless you're Michael Jordan of
money you're going to be in the minor
leagues
because you know the the big boys are
playing the money game and even China
can't compete now you say to me Scott
China has more money than Exxon
like they have more money so of course
they can compete but
they can't compete at that level without
getting caught
am I right
like you could compete at the level of
you know slipping twenty thousand
dollars to a congress person
but maybe that's not enough because
maybe they're getting more from Exxon
but if you said all right screw it we're
going to compete with Exxon I'll give a
million dollars to each politician well
now you're going to get caught
right as some dollar amount your odds of
getting away away with it shrink
dramatically
so it could be
that because our own money influence is
so strong
that that's what keeps the foreigners
from playing
which would be weird weird and wonderful
at the same time
I just speculate
um
there's a video of Obama uh talking
about rigged elections in 2008
and
if I do where my phone was I used to
have a phone I was going to play that
video but the essence of it is that in
2008 Obama was talking to some friendly
crowd and he was he was saying directly
that both Democrats and Republicans have
rigged elections in the past
and that it's hard to trust the party
that's running the election
out loud it even said I'm from Chicago
the clear indication was I know from the
inside that elections are rigged
now who's rigging the elections in
Chicago is it the Republicans
no
Obama said directly Democrats have
rigged elections
he said it directly
now that doesn't mean any future you
know after 2008 it doesn't mean any
future election was rigged but the the
fact that you know we were prevented
from talking about it and acting like
only Republicans say stuff like this
it's that the amount of gaslighting and
I this was brought to my attention by uh
Adam MD Adam dopamine you know him on
Twitter
um
yeah he tweeted this he goes Once Upon a
Time voter fraud was a given which is
exactly right
once upon a time we all assumed there
was some voter fraud we just didn't know
how much but didn't you just all assume
it was just a given
right did anybody think that Chicago was
running or Philadelphia were running
totally legit elections ever
and I'm not saying it's just Democrats
yeah I'm going to agree with Obama that
whoever is running the election they
might have a little incentive to
change things in their favor
so and then Adam said then the media gas
lit half the country into thinking
elections were the only thing in America
that were not corruptable
that might be a little of my influence
there
just just think about the fact that for
the last few years the the public has
been gaslit into believing that only the
elections work well
everything else is broken and we all
agree with that yeah everything else is
broken
but not those elections
if you think those elections are not
Totally Secure well maybe you have a
mental problem when maybe you should be
kicked off of all social media you
troublemaker
anyway
there's an article in publication called
Common Sense by Jeffrey Kane
who referred to uh tiktok as digital
Fentanyl
I like that I think the digital fentyl
is catching on have you seen it
um I think I coined that did I coin that
yeah maybe other people did too that's
the sort of thing maybe more than one
person thought of it but uh digital
fentanyl that's what it is
and
um what's interesting about this is that
it was re retweeted by Paul Graham
now do you know who Paul Graham is
um
one of the most probably one of the most
uh let's say well-respected Minds in
Silicon Valley
so famous investor type
but also Beyond being an investor
considered just one of the smart people
who understands how the world works and
he retweeted that
so he retweeted uh
calling Tick Tock digital
Fentanyl now let's go deeper
who would you trust to know if Tick Tock
were dangerous
if you trust me I appreciate it but I'm
not sure I'm the person that's the
expert on this
if Paul Graham tells you it's that Tick
Tock is digital Fentanyl
you better freaking believe it
better believe it right because he's
somebody who actually knows what he's
talking about like he knows everything
from AI to social media platforms to
software to influence like he can see
the field
if he's retweeting that Tick Tock is
digital fentanyl why the is it
still allowed to be
you know infecting our kids why the
I mean
like I said there's nobody on the other
side
how long do we have to go before
everybody notices nobody's on the other
side
there's nobody in public anyway saying I
gotta keep this Tick Tock it's no danger
nobody
now I told you uh I was a little
disappointed that our our Congress
people and senators were although they
were appropriately against Tick Tock
being available they would concentrate
on the data privacy angle and I thought
they should really be focusing a little
bit more on the persuasion angle
now that's what the Paul Graham retweet
was on a piece that didn't influence it
did talk about the the influence angle
so you see how important this is it's
like one of the smartest most trusted
people in technology
just says this is being used for
propaganda
or at least has the potential to right
sunovich too but you know cernovich has
the same problem I do
like if you were going to listen to
somebody on this topic of tick tock
would you listen to Mike cernovich
me or Paul Graham now as much as I think
sort of it's just amazing you know I
think he's a National Treasure and I
think I'm pretty awesome on days neither
of us should have any credibility
compared to a Paul Graham right so just
understand some people have way higher
credibility for this kind of
you know topic
so
um anyway I did send a DM to Senator Tom
Cotton and I just you know I sort of
challenged him on the fact that we
should be highlighting the propaganda
element and not just the data security
element
and he uh
he he tweeted this the same day
so Senator Tom Cotton tweeted tick
tock's threat isn't just data privacy
and surveillance it can also be a
massive propaganda tool for the Chinese
Communist Party
now
every once in a while I love my country
and this is one of those times
because
I'm going to tell you a story that
happened a long time ago
so this is when I was in my 20s I this
is before I did Dilbert
so I was just a guy in the cubicle
and I had a problem with a big National
a federal bureaucracy
and it was a big problem like really big
problem
and I wrote to my senator who was a
Senator Pete Wilson at the time and I
asked him if he could fix it you know
could he do something to fix this other
entity and here's the thing that just
blew my mind
I got I got an answer from the Senator's
office I don't know if you know maybe
the senator didn't see it himself but it
was is office answered and sad you know
we forwarded your message and and it
showed the letter in which they
challenged the big entity
why why the hell are you doing what
you're doing
within I think just days
the big entity changed their change
their policy
that was the first time
I changed like a national policy
just by asking
I just asked
and and I made a good point I I
supported my point I gave the evidence
and a senator of the United States
looked at little cubicle dwelling me and
said huh that's a good point I'll better
I'm going to ask that question now I
here's the thing that I have to
emphasize
this issue was not like
of national concern
it was a little more my concern and you
know maybe there were another million
people who cared about it
I changed the government with just one
good suggestion now that has never left
me
that has never left me and by the way I
did the same thing in college
in college two of my friends our
freshman year we looked at the system in
our dormitory they had like a resident
assistant
and we said why do we have these adults
in our dorm you know these grown-ups why
don't we do that ourselves and we'll
have like jobs it will be paid to manage
our own dorm
so we came up with this crazy idea that
the students would run the dorm and we
wouldn't use Professional Security or
professional resident assistants or
professional even maintenance we would
even do the cleaning ourselves
so we took this weird Stoner idea to the
administration and they said uh
well you know that's a big idea
uh if you can get enough people in your
dorm who are going to live there next
year to agree with you
then we'll consider it so we did a
petition
took it back to him
we drew out exactly what we had in mind
and this included me getting a job so I
would get it so part of part of our plan
was each of us would get our own single
rooms which were like gold having a
single room in a dormitory
is really rare if you could pull that
off so so our plan was that we would get
paid
for being the managers of the dorm
so we get paid and we get private rooms
and that was really why we were doing it
and but we also had a good idea the idea
was legitimately a good idea and the
administration said okay
and for two years three actually I had a
private room two of those years I think
I was being paid
and
it was my first example that if you made
a good if you made a good recommendation
you could get anything
and I thought to myself is this
extendable can you just make a
reasonable recommendation to somebody in
power and that if you do it well they'll
actually change something
so so by the time I was in my 20s
I thought it wasn't crazy to write to a
senator and ask them to change like a
major policy
and it worked I wrote to a senator
got a personal response and it changed
the policy
incredible
and so when I when I messaged Senator
cotton
again because the pattern the pattern is
pretty obvious and repeating did I think
that he would look at a suggestion from
a citizen
and that it would change you know and at
least the communication about an
important thing and I thought yes
I thought yes that's a real thing that
happens in the real world if you make a
good case
you can get anything done
yeah I told you during the pandemic when
Trump was looking for suggestions
of executive orders I happen to have a
little special knowledge that Telehealth
was being blocked because you couldn't
be a doctor across the state lines and
if you're on the phone you might be in a
different state so I suggested we'll get
rid of that rule especially during the
pandemic because everybody wants maximum
health care by video and he did
that was it uh as soon as people saw the
idea
the chief of staff took it to the
president the president looked out and
said yeah that looks like a perfectly
reasonable
pandemic executive order
two weeks later there's an executive
order and Telehealth is born now I think
some of it got reversed because it timed
out so we have to work through that but
um yeah Biden I think Biden reversed it
because that's the the AMA wants to
protect its doctors I think that's what
that is
so
uh
here's your lesson
don't assume
that the most powerful people in the
world won't respond to your suggestion
if it's a good one right bad suggestions
don't work but if you can learn to
communicate clearly and say this is what
I want this is why I want it here's my
backup you know to support it if you can
learn to do that you can run the whole
country
because let me ask you this who is in
charge here's your mind Bender who is in
charge of all those things I influenced
well you'd say the president was in
charge of the executive orders you say
the the you know the big organization
was in charge but were they were they in
charge
because I changed them
I personally
changed all of those things
so who was in charge
what are the greatest lessons of success
is to figure out who's in charge
and let me give you another reframe so
this will be in my upcoming book as well
um in the old days if I walked into a
room and met somebody I'd say to myself
that person is influencing how I feel
how many of you feel that way you meet
somebody you go into a room and you say
oh these people or this person is now
changing how I feel
I'm feeling
you know uh dumb or nervous or something
they're affecting me
but here's something I learned in
college also
when I smoked marijuana
people acted nice to me and when I
didn't they didn't act as nice
and for years I couldn't figure out why
and I thought it was because the
marijuana made me see the world
differently I thought okay that's just
I'm That's Just an Illusion because when
I'm high
just everything looks better so I I just
remember people being nicer but it's not
really happening
it's just an illusion
eventually as I learned more and more
about how the world is wired I realized
I was causing all those people to act
the way they acted when I came with my
relaxed happy Stoner look they
immediately copied me and they became
relaxed and happy and easy to deal with
when I came with my and
this might surprise some of you
but
I can be pretty intense does that
surprise anybody
does anybody like blown away that I can
be kind of scary and intense
I'm a little intense right so if I've
got something on my mind like I'm
working through something that matters
to me and you run into me you'll you'll
think you just ran into a serial killer
like who's planning his next his next
victim or something like I'm pretty
intense and I don't do it intentionally
it's just when I'm I'm deeply on
something
then humans become a little less
important for a while so
once I realized that they weren't
affecting me so much as I was affecting
them then I said wait here's the reframe
every time I walk into a room I say to
myself
well how do I want to affect these
people
try it
watch how that totally changes your
experience of life because I'll bet you
walk into a room and say oh these people
are affecting me
uh what are they doing to me now
uh they're making me feel sad right I
don't do that anymore
now part of it is because being famous
helps you to get into this you know
frame of mind but when I walk into a
room I know I'm changing those people
and I have to decide how
so I say well I think I'll make you
friendly
and then I make them friendly I go I
think I'll get you out of that bad mood
and then I do it I say I think I'm going
to make you like me make somebody like
me
I changed the people in the room they
don't change me
now are they changing me of course it's
just that I choose to ignore that frame
entirely because if I'm actively trying
to change them which is actually what
I'm thinking I'm actively thinking I
would like you to like me I'd like you
to laugh I'd like you to do something
with me later I'd like you to agree with
me I'd like you to respect me and then I
do the things that make you do those
things and it works every time
basically every time
yeah it's like doesn't doesn't ever not
work
all right here's another reframe
this also will be from the book
does anybody have social anxiety
you go to a gathering and you're like oh
there's people there I'm gonna have to
talk to people I don't like
all right I'm going to reframe it away
from you
if you go if you have social anxiety you
go to an event and you say to yourself
oh God these people are affecting me I'm
like I'm sweating those people are doing
this to me they're affecting me
all you have to do is learn the few like
a five minute lesson on how to make
conversation
if you learn the five minute lesson on
how to make conversation and primarily
it's about asking reasonable questions
and listening more than you talk that's
the whole technique right everybody will
like you everybody will like you if you
do that it's just this is the Dale
Carnegie process
if you learn the technique
hey how you doing my name is Scott
so uh you know do you work here where do
you live you have a family it's just
basic questions the sound they sound
like they're too too nosy but in fact
people like to be able to talk about
themselves because it it is them all
right here's the reframe
next time you walk into a room
don't do it unless you've learned the
lessons of how to ask questions
and introduce yourself so that's your
basic you have you know how to start a
conversation
and you know how to introduce yourself
now when you walk into the room
you are saving people
you're saving them you see somebody
who's not talking to somebody what do
you think is going through their head
oh oh everybody sees me not
talking to anybody oh God do they notice
I'm not even talking to anybody oh
I need to talk to somebody and you say
to yourself I can save that person
you go over and introduce themselves now
you saved them they have somebody to
talk to and if you ask them to talk
about themselves they're double saved
they're saved twice now they have
somebody to talk to and you made it easy
oh God you just solved my problem yeah
yeah I'll tell you where I work that's
easy
right and then you have to also learn
how to uh make an excuse to leave
one that I like to use if if you don't
have to go to the bathroom you don't
need to refresh your drink and those are
automatics I use those a lot here's what
you just say directly because you're
probably there to mingle
so I say hey it's been great talking to
you I'm going to do a little more
mingling
a hundred percent of people are okay
with that because they're probably there
for the same reason do a little mingling
so just say hey it's great to meet you
you maybe exchange phone numbers if it
went well and you say uh you know I'm
going to do a little more mingling and
I'll catch up with you later
right
so now I just solved your biggest social
problem
the moment you realize that was the
smallest number of skills you're you're
the CPR person you're like okay there's
one struggling I'll go save that one
yeah there's one I can save them
somebody comes into your little group of
three
and you see that it's like a shy person
who's trying to get into the group
be the one who opens up
right instead of being the one who keeps
talking because you don't know what to
do open up your body
and even even sometimes if there's a
little Gap introduce yourself to the new
person
you know don't continue the conversation
like they didn't exist introduce
yourself to the new person because you
saved them
have you ever come up to a group of
people talking and they don't they don't
acknowledge your existence
you have right it's awful Isn't it it's
the worst feeling it's like you don't
exist
right so you can instantly change
yourself from the person who's one of
them
to the person who's saving one of them
just go save them
yeah
here's another trick for uh social
interaction
pick out the highest functioning social
operator
might be an organizer but usually you
can pick out
and it's usually female
there's usually a dominant female like
connector
it depends on the group of course could
be male but if you find the dominant
person who's like the real social
connector
go right to that person
because the moment you meet that person
what did they do
what does that person do
they immediately introduce you to the
three people standing next to her and
then they say I gotta mingle I'll see
you later and they're off and then
you've got three people that you now met
that you can now connect with again if
you if you find yourself alone Etc
now
how much did that help
it's my opinion that a simple reframe
like that
can change probably I don't know 20 to
50 percent of the people just
immediately just immediately
yeah you won't believe how much it works
until you do it
right and let me let me make a another
case for why this will work
suppose I told you uh I'd like to pay
you to go to a social event
so you don't you're not there because
you want to I'm just going to pay you
and I'd like you to get as many business
cards as you can
and nothing else matters I'm just going
to pay you get as many business cards
would you feel as embarrassed
if you knew you were being paid to just
sort of do a job
and the answer is no because you feel
like oh I'm just doing a job like
there's no there's not many much Social
pressure
because the only thing you're trying to
do is get business cards you're just
doing a job
it's very easy to reframe a awkward
situation into
just mechanical
so I reframed you from the victim into
the savior
and it was easy all you needed to do was
have a little bit of skill that all the
victims don't yet have which is how to
ask questions how to enter how to
introduce yourself
and how to uh you know leave basically
all right
I hope that helped
here's uh the weirdest thing do you you
remember that uh Kanye or yay as we like
to call them now
um he got dropped by a number of apparel
makers he was working with and one of
them was uh balenciago
and the weirdest thing happened this
week
with Balenciaga and I don't even know
how to explain it
right because if it is what it looks
like
it blows my mind
what it looks like is that they had an
ad
with little kids holding
teddy bears
they were dressed in like BDSM
like leather
like very sexualized
now
if that's all it was
I could imagine saying to myself okay
maybe I'm imagining you know just
because there there's leather on a teddy
bear yeah maybe maybe it was just an
unfortunate style choice
and then the internet sleuths they
zoomed in on some other stuff in the
scene
and and there's a document on the table
that appears real
that was a a legal decision
um allowing pedophiles to I don't know
talk in public or something like that so
basically they had pedophile related
documentation in the ad
so if you had the the the leather sexual
bear to the little kid to what could not
have been an accident if it's real if
it's real maybe it got photoshopped in I
don't know but if it's real
is actually pedophiles
operating in the open
but could it be real
I'm I'm not there yet
I'm not there
because the problem is the Scott
Alexander problem do you see it
the Scott Alexander problem
um
Theory says if you see a story that
blows your mind like you say to yourself
my God how could this be happening
the answer is it isn't almost always
so maybe 95 percent of the time when you
see a story this extraordinary you find
out later it's not true
right so start with the Assumption
there's a 95 chance there's something
about this story that's just totally not
true if I had to pick
I would pick that document on the table
as the not true part
I I know people are saying that it's
been confirmed and maybe it's true
so let me be very clear it could be
exactly what it looked like
yeah it could be exactly what it looks
like
because it looks exactly like it is
but be aware if you're if you're going
to be a sophisticated consumer be aware
that there are lots of things that look
just like this meaning an extraordinary
story we say how could How could a dog
build a spaceship that's impossible
and then later you find out that no dog
built a spaceship it was exactly what
you thought it was impossible
so most of the time this kind of story
turns out false which is not to say
that this one is false there's it looks
like something's going on
right
Jay I'm not disagreeing with you
I'm just saying
you know don't don't let your head
explode if you find out it's not true
right
you've used that one before
um
handwritten letters of maybe
why is it related to this story uh why
is it that Elon Musk takes over Twitter
and immediately he can get rid of the uh
the pedophile hashtags
when apparently they've been operating
in the open for years
how do you explain that
how do you explain
that Elon Musk can make the pedophiles
go away
like effortlessly
well maybe there was some effort
but it hadn't happened before
now again remember earlier I was saying
that if you believe something's true
you'll be you'll be buried in evidence
that you're right
this this looks like that right
if you're starting if you're believing
that there's a big pedophile problem
if that's your starting point you will
see it everywhere
that doesn't mean it's true
I'm sure there's a pedophile problem but
the size of it and whether it's in each
story you see is what's in the question
all right
if I had to guess you know it's easy
it's easy to say you know it's Jack
Dorsey a blah blah
if I had to guess
I don't think Jack Dorsey had uh as much
operating control over the details of
Twitter as one imagines remember he was
running two companies
so he probably had you know a whole
bunch of people doing the the nuts and
bolts at Twitter and maybe he may have
been told they couldn't do anything
about it
you could easily imagine this scenario
where you know I'm just speculating here
you can imagine where Jack said get rid
of that pedo stuff
and then they came back and said oh we
tried really hard
there's just nothing we can do
and then you know maybe you tried a few
more times and then they kept coming
back yeah you know they they they're so
slippery we can't get them or there's
some reason we can't do whatever and
then Elon comes in and just fires you
know all those people
that is easy it might be just that he
fired the right people it could be
nothing but that that's possible
so
uh the other possibility is that you
know nothing is true in the news
um Charles Haywood I don't know who he
is but on Twitter he did
uh sort of a back of the envelope uh
estimate that Twitter should be
extremely
profitable almost immediately
and the argument goes like this
he looked into their financials and the
vast majority of their expenses are
people
and he just he just reduced them by 75
or something
and if you just do the basic math
how much money did they make and here
you'd have to assume that some of the
advertising comes back just because
advertisers go to where there are people
and you'd have to assume that maybe the
Eight dollar thing also is good
so just with those you know minor
Revenue changes if you make an
assumption that 80 percent of their
costs was personnel and then you take
you know 50 to 75 percent of that cost
away
you're instantly profitable
and not just a little bit
uh you know this the um Charles
Haywood's estimate is that they would
have one of the best profit margins in
all of Technology
it would be like right away
and then it would just start spewing
cash forever
now I'm not going to go so far as to say
that's true
but I have to say
my own math sense was already there
like in in my own head I was still
thinking well it's got to be mostly
people expense and
I mean to me
I was I was leaning in that direction
that he may have already solved for
profitability it might already be done
and he may have actually made it more
efficient by getting rid of all the uh
the dead wood and keeping the superstars
now of course he says he's keeping the
good people but you know that's
subjective
um I guess the Stormy Daniels campaign
violation thing is being renewed
does that tell you that they've run out
of material
if you're Reviving The Stormy Daniels
case
that sort of tells me you don't have
anything when I tell you that Trump is
the best vetted president of all time
is this
is this and I'm not I'm not going to
defend anything he did with Stormy
Daniels it probably was exactly what you
saw but if that's all they have that's
all they have
my God
could be could be a case of just
everybody's doing everything they can
and that's just what one person had
all right
um
I read an article in a something called
the conversation it's a publication uh
by Beth Daly
and she wrote that there might be a way
to test that we live in a simulation
now does that sound like something I've
said before I don't know who Beth is but
the way she writes one suspect she may
have been exposed to some of my material
but I don't know maybe maybe just people
think the same way
um
but here's a little uh tour of how this
simulation came about
this is from Beth's story which is quite
good actually I recommend it
I tweeted it so you can find it in my
Twitter feed so she says in 1989
the legendary physicist John Archibald
wheeler so he had this idea that the
Universe wasn't just matter
that there was something about the way
we think about it or observe the
universe the interaction of the matter
and of course
you know Quantum uh
quantum theory blah blah blah supports
that so as early as the 80s people were
saying hey maybe reality is not just
stuff maybe there's something about the
way we think about this stuff that
interacts with the stuff so there's
something that's thought plus matter or
maybe it's all thought or something
then by 2003
Nick Bostrom from Oxford University uh
he came up with a simulation hypothesis
that's highly probable that we're a
simulation because someday there will be
lots of them and what are the odds that
were the original
all right let's get rid of you we got we
gotta call a couple of here one
 God
boom anybody else
foreign
come on there's another one here I know
you're here I'm Gonna Get You
all right we'll catch you later all
right so
so then all right that's 2003 so the
simulation idea came about then uh
then there was a suggestion later that
we could be a giant quantum computer and
then as the story goes in 2016 I think
maybe it's the first time that must set
it I don't know when he started thinking
it but he concluded that we're most
likely a simulation so from 1989 to 2016
people have been doodling about this now
what's left out
my book in the 90s
in which I predicted
that the nature of reality would be
completely revised in our lifetime which
is what we're watching the simulation
Theory I didn't you know mentioned it in
specifics but it is what I predicted
that there's something about our
consciousness
and the interaction with the material
that's the real this is the real thing
all right
um
now here's a hypothesis of how you could
test that we're in a simulation
so there's a physicist late physicist
John Barrow
he argued that if we're if we're a
computation or we're software
that the um that if we're software there
would be necessarily little uh little
verbs and Imperfections and that the
little imperfections would build up over
time and that the programmer if there
was one would have to correct the
simulation every now and then because it
would build up errors and then it would
be like a software like a software
reboot and that we would notice it
that there would be a period of time
where for example the laws of physics
stopped working for a minute
would that be funny like just for like a
minute the laws of physics stop working
now I guess we'd still have gravity
right we wouldn't fly into space but
that would be one thing to look for
um
but I'm wondering if the pandemic
doesn't satisfy that
yeah or the great reset I feel like we
are in the middle of some kind of a
software update if we're a simulation
this is definitely a software update
because everything is changing right
literally everything
the way we think about everything the
way we do everything is all different it
does feel like a software update
all right
ladies and gentlemen I believe I've
improved your life and informed you
um probably the best live stream you've
ever seen in your whole life being
experience really
um how was it for you
that's just how I think it was for you
yeah
how many people are going to try that
reframe for your social anxiety
to walk into the room as the solution
and not the problem
you're going to be amazed
you're going to be amazed at well it
works
all right
someone's enjoying a cigarette
now yes
makes perfect sense
no tomorrow's not Thanksgiving is it it
better not be
yeah best show ever I think so I think I
hit all the notes and uh well I'm
leaving you better off so I'm going to
go do some other things
and uh you're all awesome
and you're probably wondering am I going
to do a live stream on Thanksgiving
what's the answer
am I going to do a live stream on
Thanksgiving
of course
would I let you down
oh no no we're definitely gonna be same
time same place but tomorrow's just a
regular day so I'll see you then too
