and see how we do we can try it with the
right date this
time do you know how many times I have
to write the date I have to write the
date five times every
morning the only one I had to type was
the one I got
wrong of course well now that you're all
here how would you like to do a
show I think you'd love it
well welcome to coffee with Scott Adams
the highlight of human civilization if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
all you need for that is a CER muger
glass a terer chel and Stein a canteen
jger flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the dopamine
head of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous zip wow what a show it's
going to be
go oh that's so
good looks like I'm only seeing comments
from oh there we go YouTube
comments everything's working just the
way it's supposed to all right here's
some uh quick hits before we get to all
the political stuff that you want to
talk
about um if you're not
watching the uh the show of uh Prince of
fakes bri. a br y. a he's uh sort of
publicly developing a sex toy that's
going to work with AI so you can swipe
left until you get the you get the AI
personality of your choice I guess male
or
female and then there's a device which I
won't describe in great detail but just
say it's uh it's meant for your your fun
bits so you can uh have a conversation
with the AI while you're uh getting
stimulated now here's what's funny about
it as soon as I bring up this topic most
of you just went
nuts I don't even have to see you to
know half of you just want I can't
handle it there's a sex toy and it's
going to have ai and it's going to
replace people and that's the fun part
of the story the fun part of the story
is watching the public reaction to one
individual who has the skills to create
not only the sextoy but the AI interface
such that he might be able he might be
replacing human
reproduction now if you don't think that
this has a genuine possibility of
destroying
humankind you're missing the show
because it does it actually could be a
replacement for like human
sex it could now not for everybody of
course but for the 80% of people who are
not exactly optimizing their sex
life this could be quite a quite a uh a
risk to civilization
itself anyway you have to watch the uh
the just freaked out comments and uh you
have to watch all of the comments to the
comments because Brian is
hilarious in how he is dealing with the
comments so you got to watch that show
all right there's a report from
University of Sydney that AI can write a
poem and edit your video and and now it
can make you funnier do you think that
AI can now make you funnier they did a
test of a caption contest where they had
the AI help people write captions for uh
cartoons and then they had them graded
and the ones where AI helped were
better now here's what's missing from
that do you know how an average Aver
person does in a caption contest where
you're adding the funny caption to a a
comic the average person on a scale of 1
to 10 is producing something like a one
or a two let's say 10 is commercial
grade humor the average person can do a
one or a two if you add the ai ai is
good with word play it'll give you a
word play dad joke that's definitely
better than a one or a two it might be
all the way up to a
five might be a five and a 10 but it is
nowhere near Commercial gr humor um and
in my experience I've played with a
bunch of AIS just to see what they know
about humor they don't even know how it
works if you ask them to even describe
why something's funny you get the worst
descriptions you've ever seen so it
doesn't it's not even close on
humor all right here's some more things
that maybe you could have just asked me
but science is confirming that
loneliness can kill and middle-aged
Americans are particularly vulnerable
why do you think middle-aged Americans
are the
loneliest versus let's say
Europe do you think it's
density is it is it just that we have
the option of living alone so we take it
whereas if you didn't have the option
you know you had to have roommates or
you had to live with your family or you
had to live with your parents or
something I feel like it's because we
have the
option oh maybe divorce yeah maybe
divorce as well yeah probably divorce
I'll throw that in as well we have
different Norms about divorce here it's
probably that
yep but uh I would say that loneliness
does in fact qualify as one of our
biggest health problems along with our
food supply being completely
poisoned and I don't know that anybody
has an idea for dealing with it so let
me tell you here's how you deal with
loneliness and it's the only way you
create natural ways that people can be
in groups to do group
activities nothing else Works once
you're an adult you don't just make
friends hey you seem
nice let's be friends and we can hang
out that almost never happens in the
real world what does happen is you join
a uh a botch League and then you get to
know some of the other botchy players
and then you say hey I got a botchy
Court come over and play you know
practice of my place and then you can do
something but you have to have at least
some activity in common or it just
doesn't work for adults the number way
number one way that adults make friends
is the parents of their children's
friends that's like the number one way
and that works great by the way so if
you don't have that going for you it's
hard to make friends
so more activities we need something
that would get normal people out of the
house and in any kind of a group doing
any kind of a
thing uh more evidence that weight
training improves your anxiety and
depression in old people how how many
times do you have to see a
study that shows that exercise is better
than uh therapy and meds it's just every
time now you know I always tell you
don't don't believe studies because
studies are sort of a coin flip but if
all of the studies are in the same
direction and it's been years well that
probably does mean something so I'm
pretty sure that weight training does
improve anxiety and depression and by
the way my biggest BS filter is that if
science claims something but you don't
observe it in person it's probably not
real but you do observe it anybody who's
ever done weight training knows they
feel better when they're done do you
agree is that observably obviously true
to all of you that when you do exercise
or weight training your mental state is
just immediately
improved it's kind of obvious now how
many of you have had this
experience there be somebody in your
circle who says I'm very depressed and
I'm thinking of getting professional
help and then you say you know before
you do that and that might be necessary
I don't want to poo poo the professional
help
but before you do that would you
consider doing the thing that works
every time which is
exercise well I'm thinking of you know
this or that therapist I feel like you
didn't even hear the sentence I just
said did you hear me say that if you
just exercise you might get more
benefits than that thing that you're
planning so I'm looking for a
recommendation now I feel like you
didn't even hear the words that came out
of my voice out of my mouth
have you had that conversation where
people can't even hear
it so I think there must be something
about being in that situation where you
also can't hear obvious Solutions not
complete Solutions but something that
would
help anyway just an observation people
can't hear that
advice here's another one should have
asked Scott they did a study of weight
loss for obese women that were not very
active and they said uh some of them eat
a big breakfast they all ate big
breakfast breakfasts but some of them uh
ate a lot of carbs and some of them a
lot of carbs and protein and the others
did a strict low carb diet what do you
think was
better
um the big breakfast high in protein and
carbs or the strict low carb
diet they could have asked me
because if you do protein first you
always do
better so here's what I wrote in my book
out of failed almost everything and
still wi big that's now second edition
you can get it is
that what matters with
diets is whether you can stick to them
and everything else doesn't matter it's
it's also true with
exercise if you say what matters with
exercises that I do it and what matters
with the diet is that whichever one I
pick I can I can make it work so it's
the psychological part that we get wrong
not the how to do
it right you you could figure out how to
exercise it's not the hardest thing in
the world you could figure out how to
eat right but the doing it the
motivation the actual the mental part is
the hard part so that's the part I teach
and how to failed almost everything and
still went big I teach you how to beat
the mental part and then the physical
part becomes almost trivial if you get
the mental part right
but here's what I tell you if you can't
do anything else right if you're hungry
look for a protein that's my trick so
that's the mental trick if you're hungry
look for protein if you think that
hungry means whatever you put in your
mouth satisfies your hunger you won't do
well because carbs tend to be more
available so if you just convince
yourself the hunger equals
protein or good fats you know like a
good avocado is good too you'll just do
better just protein first protein
protein protein if you can afford it of
course um here's another one maybe you
should have asked me turns out they did
a big study about uh gender dysphoria in
young people and turns out that the
puberty blockers and hormone treatments
for gender transition is not uh is not
backed up by any kind of quantitative
science whatsoever in ter terms of
whether the people are happier after
it's done how many people are surprised
by
that could have asked me and by the way
if the science had said the
opposite you would still handle it the
same
way you get that right so so there
apparently there's no strong evidence or
not even weak evidence that uh that
these early interventions for the gender
dysphoria uh is likely to turn out well
but suppose they did have
evidence suppose hypothetically just as
a mental experiment suppose the science
indicated that 2third of the kids who
wanted to transition as
kids uh were glad they
did now that's not the case but just
imagine if it were the case would that
be a strong case to transition
children
no no no that absolutely would not be
strong case to transition children if
onethird of them would be worse off and
children can't make
decisions it just makes sense to wait
you know because you can't make that
decision for them that's that's the hard
part so I think even if the science were
the other way still would make sense to
wait now I get that you know there's
some argument if you started early You'
get a better outcome but I don't think
that's a strong enough argument
so you could have just asked me about
every one of these things about the
weight training I would have told you
about the diety protein I would have
told you about maybe it's not a good
idea to transition kids I would have
told you that and about the AI that can
write humor uh I would have told you
that that's fake and it can't write
humor so there are four scientific
studies that literally literally you
could just asked
me now I think you could have asked most
of you as
well yeah how many of you are surprised
by any of
that no none of you right I'll bet there
was not one thing I said that you didn't
also know before the
science all
right here's the funniest story uh so
the California Senate Judiciary
Committee so now they've approved a
bill um so I guess this has to be voted
for but it would be ail to create uh
some kind of uh mechanism to figure out
which descendants of slavery live in
California because they want the black
residents of California who are but only
the ones descended from some kind of
slave situation in
America um they want them to be eligible
for reparations but first we have to
figure out if they can be identified so
the first thing they're going to do is
see if they can use a genetic kind of uh
process to check the genes of uh
Californians to find out who's eligible
now here's the fun
part it's the
math are you ready for this this will be
the this will be the funniest thing
you've heard today if you has everybody
heard this story yet it's going to be
the funniest thing you hear today you
ready California has about 6.5% black
residents suppose half of them can prove
that they're descended from
slaves so you'd have you know
3.25 but there are 72% uh White Citizens
in
California how many of the White
Citizens will show up having DNA that
connects back to slavery as in they have
a relative who was a descended from
slaves and the answer is it doesn't have
to be a very large percentage
because it's being uh that percentage
would be against the
72% of citizens who are white so there
is a very good possibility not yet
confirmed that there will be more white
people in California who would get
reparations for slavery
legitimately legitimately because they
would actually be descended from slaves
uh that there would be numerically more
of them than the number of black
citizens who could also prove that they
were descended from slaves
so is that perfect or is that
perfect does it seem like I'm totally in
control of the simulation at this point
does it look to you like reality is
starting to conform to what I would have
written as a
joke it's a little too on the nose isn't
it I I think it's reality I think I mean
I've lost all sense of reality but I
think it's real but what could be more
perfect than that now this this is the
beauty of the go go study
it I can tell you as a person whose job
it was in Corporate America to go study
stuff that was what I did it's like hey
we don't know if we want to do this
financial thing go study it we don't
know if we want to replace this you know
Network equipment go study
it it's
as soon as you you go study stuff you
you get a lot of
surprises and and this is one of them
now I would not have predicted this
specific surprise but I would have
predicted surprises meaning that as soon
as you started studying it it doesn't
look like what you think it is so here's
the other
surprise if they did a legitimate
calculation they would have to net it
out because you would have to net out
other things that were you know
advantages to Black Americans you'd have
to compare it to you know the people who
were not slaves who stayed in Africa if
you did an actual analysis of what is
Ed I'm not even sure which way it would
go you might find that descendants of
slaves owe money to white
Americans if you actually did the math
now if you did it correctly now I don't
think there's any intention to do it
correctly but if you did it correctly it
might be opposite of what you think
don't
know well Mark Zuckerberg is not going
to be legally responsible for kids being
hooked on Instagram I guess there are 25
cases along those lines and uh it's all
uh dismissed because it's not a standard
that America accepts that the CEO is
going to be personally responsible for
that sort of thing so it's more like it
was dismissed not because the kids did
not get addicted
so that wasn't the
question all right I got to see what
this little image
says
Okay
um so anyway that's
happening all right here here's another
funny story so where was this an axios I
think um that there's an insect
Armageddon coming from climate change so
the uh research surveyed so this is a CL
climate change alarm
story now I want you to see if you think
that the alarm is changing
nature here's what we used to worry
about climate change is going to drown
us all now that's pretty
scary climate change is already killing
the polar bears well I don't know if
that'll affect me directly but they're
big old mammals and it bothers me when
mammals are dying so that's scary the
hurricanes are going to kill us all from
the climate change but turns out the
Hurricanes aren't any worse than
there um and the we won't be able to
grow food but doesn't seem to be a
problem yet so they're looking for new
problems to scare us and researchers at
the University of Colorado uh
Boulder um they studied 12 ant species
and they found that the ants in Gregory
Canyon um have uh some of them have
moved on to other environments because
they say it was too warm probably
climate
change so we went from you're all going
to drown and your food supply be fried
and the polar bears are already dying
and you're next
to we're now concerned that some
subspecies of ants will
relocate oh no oh oh
no I I I wasn't worried about climate
change until you told me that some of
these several species of ants might
relocate
no no not relocating ants
no the climate uh the climate narrative
has completely
collapsed now I don't know if everybody
knows it yet but I'm telling it
completely collapsed and it was the uh
the pandemic that did it you know I've
said it before but I'll I'll keep
reminding you the public argument in
other words the part that the public
understood was that all the climate
scientists were on the same
side that's all we had because we don't
do the science and I can't check the
science I don't know how to check the
science so it's all we had and now we
know that that's ridiculous and was
never a real reason and that the experts
can absolutely all be on the same side
very easily as long as that's where the
money
is on my uh my locals Community where
you have to be a subscriber to see the
good stuff I did a uh what I call a
micro lesson I've got over 200 micro
lessons two minutes I teach you
something or reframe that you didn't
know so they're all they're all designed
to make your life better like just watch
it for 2 minutes and then you go oh I
got a new life skill so one of the life
skills is how to explain to somebody uh
why those climate models are a
BS now if you look at a climate model
you if you visualize it you know there
are dozens if not hundreds of climate
models and you know that they like to
draw it in a in sort of a wide band
there's like well all the models conform
to sort of this band and they all seem
to be hockey sticking up and there's so
many models that are in the same you
know
range and they'll show that the problem
is going to be in the future much worse
so therefore it's believable because
they're all in the same range and you
might call that range the the
probability zone or the probability band
you know the the place that probably
were going to be within that that band
here's another way to think of that band
that's the paycheck band if you created
a climate model that did not fall within
that band that they've already decided
is the narrative you couldn't get paid
and it turns out that it's expensive to
build and maintain a climate model it's
not something you could do in an
afternoon and once you build it you have
to tweak it forever because the data is
always changing you're getting smarter
you found out something your model
didn't hindcast anymore something like
that so you're always it's like an
expensive thing so in order to get a
budget to maintain your climate model
you've got to make sure that your model
is within that narrow band
otherwise you don't get a
paycheck there is nothing scientific
about that they simply told all the
scientists make sure your data is in
this narrow band or you can't get paid
and they all know it so if you have if
the only conclusions are the ones you
can get paid for how do you expect
anybody to produce a model that's
outside that
band that can never happen in the real
world in the real world they all have to
be inside that narrow band or else they
discard the model so if somebody came up
with one if they found a way to fund one
and it didn't fit the model and they
produced it what would happen they would
be mocked down of climate science
because their model is not within the
narrow band that everybody is sure is
the true one you just can't you can't
you can't get out of that
band now you might say but Scott you're
no climate scientist so why are you even
weighing in on this climate stuff to
which I say I'm an economist I my
background is economics I have a MBA so
I know business and economics and I know
that if you describe this situation
where the only way you could get paid
just to make sure that your data with
within this narrow band and then you
also knew because you studied economics
that you can make a projection fit
anything you want just keep tweaking
things until it fits uh oh
it was just a little alarm sounded got a
low battery somewhere I
think all right you're going to hear
that again at about 15 seconds
beep so anyway that's why climate models
are BS
um so it looks like Maine is going to be
the latest to join this interstate
effort I wasn't paying much attention to
that would say that the state would give
all of its um electoral votes in a
presidential election would give them
all to whoever got the most votes in the
whole country so basically it would be
doing away with the electoral system
without doing away with it so they' keep
it but they'd make it irrelevant by just
giving all the votes whoever won the
popular vote in the country now you can
tell that the only purpose of this is to
put Democrats in charge forever right
because there there are more of them and
the only way Republicans ever win
is if they they win in the key
Battleground places so they're trying to
take the one advantage that Republicans
have to ever win they're trying to add
10 million people to the voting roles
mostly Democrats the the
migrants and uh changing the rules at
the same time so I remind you that we
don't have and we haven't lived in
anything like a republic or a Democratic
Republic or a Democratic federal
republic whatever we're called for a
long long time it's all about the rules
so whoever changes the rules counts the
votes decides who can run who can be in
the primary those are the things that
decide who the president we we're a long
way away from the voters will deciding
the presidency and and I think we should
stop teaching it to kids
really I think we should stop lying to
children and say we have we have this
system where people vote and you know
your vote matters your vote doesn't
matter your vote doesn't matter at all
all that matters is which rules get
implemented before the vote if it's
one-sided rules you can tell who's going
to win if the other set of rules you can
tell who's the other's going to win it's
the rules so whoever controls the rules
decides who's in power and that's not
you all right
um so there's some effort to prevent uh
new residents from
voting um
and obviously that's the reason for the
bringing in all the uh illegal people is
to affect the
election all
right nearly two-thirds of American
voters believe the situation along the
border is an invasion
64% oh my God anyway we already knew
that
um let's see so Rasmus did a poll and
asked uh would you cheat to
win uh in the 2024 election so voters
were asked would you cheat to win 28%
said
yes
28% uh now it wasn't actually wasn't
that different between the Democrats and
the Republicans so don't get all
cocky it was about a quarter roughly a
quarter
um yeah roughly a quarter with
sheet now given
that um all of Democrats believe that
Trump is Hiller because they been told
that do you think that one in four being
willing to
cheat so let's say they're
willing so so they're able so they have
the opportunity if if one in four were
willing to cheat that would be enough
people willing to cheat who are running
elections which you agree if it's true
that one and four would be willing to
cheat certainly the people who handle
the actual security for an
election probably one and four there's
no reason to think that the people
managing the elections have a you know
lower rate of being willing to cheat so
if you had a system in which one in four
told you they'd be willing to cheat and
then you also knew they had the
opportunity because we have elections
that can't be fully audited
so they have the willingness and the
opportunity but do they have the the
motivation well yes they do because the
news has been telling them that Trump is
Hitler and then on the Republican side
they look at Biden and he looks like
he's Hitler so you got two groups that
both think the other one is a fascist
you know dictator Hitler of course they
have a reason so they get the
motivation they have said they're
willing in enough numbers and they
certainly have the
opportunity if they're managing
elections so do you think there's any
chance that elections are
fair if a quarter of the people
involved would be willing to cheat and
they've got the best reason ever we're
stopping
Hiller and you see them acting like this
in person you know like the uh the CEO
of NPR who's getting a lot of heat this
week if you look at her
posts it does look like she'd be willing
to cheat because she would believe that
she was saving the
country if I thought I could save the
country I'd cheat wouldn't you if you
thought you were literally saving the
country I'd cheat because I'd rather
save the country of
course so to to imagine that our
elections are fair is it's kind of
laughable in 2024
you know which is not to say that I have
specific information about any cheating
I
don't I
[Music]
don't um well here's one of my themes
today which is maybe some limits have
been reached limits of patience for
example uh John Cougar melan Camp was
giving a Show recently and uh he managed
to say something Pro Biden and was
unable to finish the show because he got
booed off the stage and ended up just
quitting he he just walked
off so
apparently some kind of limit has been
reached with the public where if you go
on stage in public and act like
everybody's on the same page and hey you
know Biden's the greatest and Trump is
the devil then you're not going to
finish your show you you have to go home
after that he had to go
home yeah so the uh apparently the
Republicans and maybe Independents in
the audience said no we came here for
music if you're going to give us that go
home and then he had to go home they
sent him home basically
good there's a story about RFK Jr who
said that uh some Trump allies asked him
to be VP now the word he used was not
allies but the headline says allies he
said
Emissary so that some Trump emissaries
were feeling him out of being about
being Trump's vice president let me tell
you how to interpret that it wasn't
trump it wasn't Trump you have to
understand
that if if somebody says it was his
allies or his
emissaries it wasn't
Trump now what I call I call this the
fantasy politics season here are two
things that are pure fantasy politics
Michelle Obama is going to replace Biden
is never going to happen in the real
 world ever but we can't stop
talking about it because it's fantasy
politics wouldn't that be interesting
RFK Jr as the VP for a republican is the
same thing that's Pure Fantasy politics
there isn't any chance that Trump would
have considered a rep a Democrat for a
vice president zero chance that's Pure
Fantasy so if in fact some emissaries or
some allies were feeling RFK Jr out
about it they they may have acted like
it was more serious than it really was
because if they could get him to say yes
then they could go to Trump and say you
know it's not hypothetical he would say
yes so I think the Allies were trying to
make something happen that I can't
believe I can't believe for a
second that Trump would have taken
seriously because it would have been a
huge mistake you agree right it would be
a gigantic mistake to just put a
Democrat on as a vice president I mean
it's just it's just fantasy politics
it's not things that could happen in the
real world so no I don't think there's
any evidence whatsoever that Trump was
flirting with RFK Jr as vice president
now if you said would he flirt with him
as an attorney
general or as some kind of role to fix
our food supply I say yes because I
think those people I think they have a
sufficient level of respect
for each other that if the if the fit
was right yes I think so I I'm not
predicting
it but you could imagine him having a
role in the administration but not VP
that would be
crazy uh axio says us is on the rate to
see the lowest levels of violent crimes
and homicides since Obama was an office
that's
axios does anybody believe that do you
believe that violent crime is for some
reason taking a a
plunge well it might be but do we
believe any statistics or is it more
likely they change the way they're
recording the statistics or something
like that you know the other possibility
is I wonder if all the the people who
were shootable already got killed do you
ever wonder about that like let's say
murder just became way more
common wouldn't you fairly quickly reach
the limit of the number of people who
are worth
shooting like what if you just run out
of people who are worth murdering
because you know most of the murder is
people who know each
other like you probably know somebody
you'd be willing to kill but you know
just
one like if I if I said to you I I know
you're against murder but let's just say
hypothetically you had a magic button
and you could make just one person die
and nobody would know it was you it just
you just have to pick one person who's
so bad in your personal Circle you just
think that's better off the world's
better off as they're dead would you
push the button well some of you would
and I actually wonder if all the people
were worth killing already already got
killed for example a lot of people who
get killed are themselves just monsters
you know they people who have killed
other people they've H other people and
then you they went too far and somebody
killed them
so iway it's just a question whether the
the stats are wrong could it be
something that happened with policing
this
different um or could it be that
everybody worth killing just got killed
so you ran out of people who are worth
killing
anyway uh where I live in my County
there's a DA called Pamela price who's
one of these Soros funded prosecutors a
black woman and uh I I've never seen
anything political in my town until this
meaning that you rarely are going to see
like a a campaign sign in anybody's
lawn you know I I don't know why but
where I live it's just a very
non-political place there's there's not
going to be any um nobody's going to be
protesting in town there aren't going to
be any parades for political
reasons uh it's just very non-political
place but the only thing I've seen a lot
of is people collecting signatures to
get rid of the uh the
da that I've seen a lot and I've signed
it so I've signed that petition so
they're they're working like all the
grocery stores every time you go in a
grocery store somebody's there asking
you to get rid of Pema
price so it looks like they're they're
getting close to reaching a a number
where they can recall her that might
actually happen so it looks like people
have reached a limit
well here's something that we can't
limit the fisa thing is moving along to
the Senate and as you know there will be
no Provisions saying that um the
intelligence people have to get a
warrant to look into ordinary Americans
so now you have lost all 100% of your
privacy 100% of your privacy now
officially gone because the intelligence
people can look into anything you're
doing with then a warrant
they just have to have some
reason that you talk to somebody from
another country how often do you talk to
somebody from another
country it kind of happens a
lot if you talk about politics or if
you're doing anything that matters in
the world it probably is affecting other
countries and you've got some ongoing
conversation how hard would it be for
the intelligence people to say okay you
talk to somebody another country and
it's just sort of some business person
but oh hello we can make a connection
between that business person who is just
ordinary business and uh they've got a
brother-in-law who's part of the the
Communist
party so you got the Communist Party you
got the brother-in-law you got this guy
in another country that's good enough to
watch the guy in the other country oh
well if you're making a phone call with
an American we have to see both sides
and then they can get anything they want
on you so basically all privacy now
completely gone so the government can
look at whatever they want without
without a warrant now you could argue
that you never had any privacy because
it's easy to get a war which would be a
pretty good argument but now don't even
have that little tiny little Safeguard
they can just do whatever they want
apparently so there's
that there's a company that can make you
into your own digital clone fairly
easily deac Chopra who is 77 he has
already got a little clone and
apparently for some uh monthly fee
there's a company
called Deli that will let you create
your first your own digital clone now
I'm not sure if I will create mine using
this particular app but as you know it
has long been my plan long before AI was
practical for I know decades I've been
telling you that as soon as it gets here
going to create a digital version of
myself so I'll look into this one but
this might be it so what I imagine in
maybe a year is if you go to dilbert.com
instead of having to read all the text
about where my work is and where you can
find it you could just call it my bot
say hey
Scott where can I find your comic oh
well you can look at it on the uh the
xplatform if you subscribe to me or the
locals platform it's Scott items. locals
or you could buy my books reframe your
brain and it will just answer all your
questions maybe even look for reprints
you want a license and everything else
so one year or less um I should have
that up and
running well of course Trump's in that
stormy Stormy Daniels uh paying paying
to shutter up case that's so confusing
that uh V did a video was 2 minutes and
40 seconds explaining the complic ations
of that trial and why it's all Bs and
lawfare now if you saw it and it's easy
to find just for look for V and uh his
video on law fair and stormmy Daniels
it'll pop right up here's why I would
recommend you watch it it's a
complicated
situation which V explains perfectly
like really summarizes it just perfectly
but that's not why you should watch
it you should watch it because I'm
pretty sure now I don't know this for
sure I think he did it with one
take watch it again just watch it again
and ask yourself did he do that with one
take without notes because it doesn't
look like he's reading it I think he did
that with one take you have to see
it like we're not used to this
like we we just don't see this one take
for that it's
crazy it's just crazy I don't think he I
don't think he stumbled over a word 2
minutes and 41 seconds of talking about
a super complicated thing off the top of
his head incredible anyway you got see
it Elon Musk also weighed in and said it
was you know obviously Corruption of
justice and lawfare
and of course that makes
news um and then Jack babek reminds us
that in
2022 Hillary Clinton quietly settled a
campaign Finance violation about the the
steel dossier and who funded it and
whether was quote Legal Services she
paid a fine and was never
arrested and Jack says that's the same
thing Trump is on trial for
now so you got V saying this is a
Corruption of the system you got Elon
musk saying this is an obvious
Corruption of Justice you've got Hillary
Clinton who wasn't arrested for some
version of the same
crime and even Rachel mat asked this
question of her audience uh why are we
still talking about something about the
2016
election why why is that even a thing
it's not about the 2020 election it's
not about
2024 the Stormy Daniels thing is about
2016
why are we caring about
that well um as Eric abinanti responded
to Rachel mow on X it's because the left
is blatantly weaponizing the justice
system to take out their top opponent
the only reason it's a thing is because
it's bad for Trump do you think Rachel
madow doesn't know that that the only
reason it exists is because it's bad for
Trump and that the corrupt the system is
completely corrupt
well it gets better so they're picking
the jurors for this trial and the jurors
are being asked you know if they're
biased or if they could be
impartial apparently 50 prospective
jurors were dismissed for saying they
can't be fair and impartial about Trump
but eventually they will find people who
said they can be fair and impartial
about Trump in other words the only
people on the jury will be
Liars I'm not making that up because
obviously nobody's impartial about Trump
can we all agree on that literally
nobody unless they haven't been paying
attention and then they're too stupid to
be on a jury if somebody doesn't have a
strong opinion about Trump you don't
want them anywhere near a jury because
they're so lame that they can't
you know probably find their way home so
you either have the stupidest people in
the world or the biggest liar
and that's our system of justice and by
the way they're doing it right in front
of you right in front of you do do you
think any of you
believe that they're going to find
impartial jurors nobody believes that
nobody believes that not a single
citizen of the United States not a
Democrat not a republican nobody and yet
they're going to do it
anyway what's up with that it's exactly
what it looks like it's complete
corruption and it's so
blatant that they can do it right in
front of you now um a lot of people are
saying and I think I agree with it so
far that uh it's all good for Trump
because every day he's in trial on what
is obviously corruption yeah not on his
part but obvious corruption on the part
of the Department of Justice that it
should help
him but I don't think we have really an
election that elects who the people want
to elect I mean it's obvious that we're
we're pretty far from that
standard but uh yeah we'll have a jury
of idiots and liars and they'll come up
with something uh Politico is reporting
that uh uh a number of the defendants
the January 6 defendants there are 350
of them that are in jail for something
like uh
obstructing justice and uh interfering
with
some documents or
something now there's one judge a trump
appointed judge who's who basically
threw out some cases so there are
currently people in
jail while there are people other people
who were accused of exactly the same
thing and the judge threw it out as
BS basically I think he probably just
said it's a
protest now the Supreme Court's taking
it on as they should because if the
Lower Court judges can't even decide if
it's a crime or not a crime well that's
perfect job for the Supreme
Court and I didn't realize just how much
they had to torture the law to make any
of this illegal so apparently it came
out of some Enron
law the Enron
law was specifically about Enron
destroying records so they wanted it to
be illegal to destroy records that are
part of an official proceeding such as
as a court
case
so does it sound like the January 6
people were destroying
[Music]
records um to interfere with an official
proceeding no they were not destroying
any
records so they had to stretch it from
the original intention which of
destroying evidence to Simply
interfering with an official
proceeding because I guess the language
of the law is Broad enough that they
thought they could get away with that so
so were people who were protesting
interfering with an official
proceeding well yes they were they were
intentionally trying to interfere with
the professional proceeding but they
were specifically trying to improve
it which somehow gets left out of the
conversation yes they did want to
interfere with it to make sure that the
system was working not to break the
system they wanted to delay to make sure
that the the count was accurate and they
just said hey two days and then at the
same time Trump was organizing the
so-called fake
electors
but what do we know if Trump's lawyers
go to jail for the fake elector scheme
what can you determine from that number
one that a court said it was illegal to
try to organize these fake electors
number two the lawyers went to jail for
it or not jail Eastman Eastman got
disbarred or something so if the lawyers
get in trouble for it what does that
tell you about
Trump let me connect the dots for you if
the lawyers got in trouble for it it
means that Trump was operating under
legal
advice under legal advice that's why the
lawyers are in
trouble so how how in the world does the
principal get in trouble for following
the advice of
lawyers and what and how can you say
that that's uh interfering with an
official proceeding if the lawyers
thought it was
legal there there's no indication that
Trump thought it was
illegal because it all came from his
lawyers he didn't make up any of it it
was all stuff his lawyers said you know
I think we could maybe make this
work so the fact that the lawyer ERS are
in trouble tells you Trump should not be
because it means it was a
lawyer organized concept and he just
said
yes
so um so apparently this law is complete
BS that they stretched it from some
Enron thing into into a slightly
delaying a process to improve it so they
went from destroying records that would
be NE necessary in a court case very bad
to protesting and using your first
amendment but too aggressively you know
the trespassing was over the line
and to improve a process publicly
transparently they wanted to
transparently and publicly improve a
process that appeared to them to be
broken at the
moment and they're going to they're
going to try to torture that until you
should be in jail and they are in jail
so what's going to happen if the Supreme
Court rules that all of these people who
are in jail
for um these charges these obstruction
of justice charges what happens if they
all get
freed what does that do to the
narrative well as uh Politico points out
that's not necessarily going to mean
Trump is off the
hook because Trump um or was part of
organizing these fake
electors whereas the protesters didn't
organize any fake electors so this Enron
rule about you know falsifying documents
and stuff they're going to torture that
thing into falsifying and destroying
documents as the same as getting a fake
slate of
electors which by the way we know from
the documentation at the time was to
preserve their legal challenge
it was just to preserve the legal
challenge basically just the legal
strategy so I don't think that's that's
such a
thin such a thin
charge it seems to me if the 350 people
get out even though they're not exactly
in the same situation as Trump that the
whole obstruction of justice thing is
going to look like BS for Trump too that
the that the the
glow from the Supreme Court kicking out
the other
cases should should end up giving Trump
a little
Advantage um yeah so right now we're
watching protesters uh block Bridges you
know the the anti-israel protesters but
the people who are blocking bridges are
they um are they stopping some kind of a
legal
process are they stopping a legal legal
process or just
traffic so they're probably okay because
it's just
traffic but suppose suppose you were a
suppose it was a Republicans who were
doing it do you think they could torture
the law to turn it into a crime sure
they'll say somebody on that bridge was
going to a
official to some official event and you
stop them from doing it so you stop the
government for working so you got to go
to jail you obstructed Justice somehow I
know I feel like they could torture
anything into anything at this
point so speaking of those people on the
on the bridges um did you see that Tom
Cotton Senator Tom Cotton said that the
citizens should take matters into their
own hands and don't wait for the
police basically he was in favor of uh
getting out of your car and dragging
people out of the road now I would stop
he didn't say violence he did not say
violence people sort of read that
between the lines but he didn't say that
he said take matters into your own hands
I think take matters into your own hands
should be limited to physically dragging
them out of the
way which I agree with does it seem to
you that some kind of limit has been
reached yes I think the Supreme Court's
going to find the limit on the
obstruction of justice stuff and reverse
it I think Tom con is telling people to
take matters into their own hands I
think maybe they will I don't know
you're seeing some stories in the Press
of people taking matters into their own
hands more than you expected maybe
that's a thing and uh generally
everywhere you look there's something
like a limit that's been
reached now I'll say it again because as
part of our fantasy
politics Democrats like to talk about
the day that Trump goes to jail so that
that's their fantasy
politics and I want to say as clearly as
possible because Clarity really helps
you know the one thing that can get you
in serious trouble is not understanding
the room like if you do something you
don't think it's going to cause a
revolution but then it does because you
didn't understand the room let me
explain the
room Trump in court is very very
bothersome like his supporters don't
like it at all but so far they can
handle it meaning they think he'll
probably
Prevail so they don't need to get
involved but if Trump goes to jail for
one
day all bets are
off now I never I never recommend
violence of course so don't do anything
violent or illegal but I'm just saying
that the social contract will be gone at
that
point and in my opinion it should be at
that point all options are on the table
I don't recommend violence but all
options would be on the table so if the
Democrats want to push it to the
breaking
point that's the breaking point and I
want to be as clear as possible about
that one day in
jail is going to make me feel like you
put me in
jail if you put Trump through the legal
process it feels like that's about
Trump if you put him in jail for one day
one hour one hour that's
personal because I know they're going to
do it to
me and I would say that I would pull out
um I would I would remove all controls
at that point at that point there
wouldn't be anything I wouldn't be
willing to do the social contract would
be gone I don't recommend violence I'm
just saying that whatever you thought
was the limit on other people's
behavior 1 hour in jail the limit will
be gone and I can't predict what happens
after that if you want if you want that
situation complete
unpredictability put him in jail for one
hour you're not going to like
it you're definitely not going to like
it but again no
violence all right uh there's an NGO in
Mexico that's handing out flyers to tell
people that they need to to vote for Joe
Biden once they come to this country
illegally so that uh more illegal people
can be led into the country like
them so yeah it's exactly what you
thought that the migration situation is
a political process and
uh I think we're done with
it I think we've reached the limit you
know what else we've reached the limit
to I feel there's a very high chance
that the election will be RI
and really obviously and really right in
front of
us I'm not sure we're going to be able
to put up with it this time I mean there
was a protest last time that turned into
you know the Insurrection
but I don't think you want to do it this
time I I feel like this time things
would go differently and I don't think
that people would be dumb enough to
attack the capital or anything like that
but don't do it right in front of us
don't make it obvious I
mean I think the limit has been
reached so ran is talking about they
have some secret weapon unspecified
which is just a good thing to say if you
think you're going to get attacked we
don't know if Israel yet is going to
make a direct attack on Iran but there's
a lot of talk about
that and some say that secret weapon
could be a a nuclear dirty bomb
well here's what I know for sure if Iran
ever used a nuclear dirty bomb
anywhere I'm pretty sure we'd have to
put him out of
business would you
agree like that would be a a limit that
would be the limit the limit is if you
if you nuke anything you can't be a
country anymore at least with the
leadership they have so I I love the
Iranian
people um if you're lucky enough to know
any you know anybody who was born and
raised in Iran I think you'd agree with
me amazing people amazing people just
the the nicest warmest friendliest smart
usually well educated you know looking
to make a difference kind of people so
the Iranian people are amazing and I
definitely don't want to get in a fight
with them but their
leadership might make themselves a
Target if they did a dirty bomb
um so here's what here's what I think
the Israel's options are now now I
remind you that I don't support
Israel um because the ADL has labeled me
a holocaust
denier obviously I'm not a holocaust
denier but the ADL of course is not uh
directly reporting to Israel they're a
separate American entity uh however
that's not my problem because Israel
could turn them off if they want to they
would just have to disavow them and it'd
be hard for them to raise money so given
that the ADL is um a a uh an enemy of
mine um I I can't support Israel while
the ads after me is that
fair and and trust me I understand that
they're separate
entities but I don't care that's not my
problem so anyway so I'm not supporting
Israel I'm just dis
describing their
options uh option one there will never
be a better time to do a decapitation
strike on
Iran I'm not recommending
it I'm not recommending it I'm saying if
they ever wanted to there'll never be a
better chance because they've got a free
punch right now it's a free punch if
they go too far this would be the only
time they could come back from that
because too doesn't look the same as it
did before October 7th does
it what you would have considered as
going too far on October
6 would not look like too far
today so and if time goes by and let's
say things
normalized it would be impossible to
take out their leadership and think you
could get away with it but in the
context of having them funding October
7th everybody assumes it seems obvious
um and the ongoing attacks Hezbollah you
know continues to send missiles and
that's Iranian backed and Hamas is not
giving up the hostages Iran Iranian
backed and then Iran did that massive
missile and drone attack on Israel which
fortunately was mostly thwarted but
under that context Israel can take out
the um the leadership of
Iran and probably no other time that
could have been
possible so if they don't do it I doubt
they'll ever get another chance because
everything that's happening now is just
so unique it just doesn't it's not
likely they'll ever get another shot so
again not recommending it but if it
happened don't be surprised and it would
be the only time they could get away
with
it uh also they could get away with it
because Biden is so
weak um again that's more of an
impression
uh it might be that the Biden
Administration is plenty tough and I
don't know you maybe they're playing it
right I don't know but he's perceived
his
weak and probably perceived as a lame
duck in the sense that it doesn't look
like he would win if you're if you're
outside the country you probably think
he's not going to
win so if you got a weak president and
uh then the other fact is that Israel in
my opinion has already spent their
Holocaust chip
so what they're doing in Gaza will
forever be called by their enemies as a
genocide and that just essentially
kneecaps the whole Holocaust narrative
that has been so useful up to now now if
you going to give away your biggest
asset the Holocaust narrative you want
to make sure you got your money's
worth and so far I don't think they have
if if the only thing they've done
is uh get aggressive super aggressive
with
Gaza then they spent their chip and I
don't know if they got anything back and
if they rebuild Gaza the way it was then
they gave it away for nothing they got
nothing they'll just recreate the
problem so you don't spend your greatest
asset and get nothing the only thing
that would be worth that expense was
would be to take um Iran out as a risk
in the future yeah I don't mean destroy
the country that would be very very bad
but a leadership decapitation strike
maybe um or if they don't do that here
would be the other way to go if you
wanted to go psychological rather than
kinetic I think Israel should say look
the the reason we have this problem is
Iran if Iran were not funding all these
entities none of this would be happening
so Iran owns the uh the people who have
been displaced the Gaza residents just
say here's the deal Iran you can feed
them all you want and we'll open up the
corridor so Iran if you want to feed
them you you broke Gaza we didn't break
it we just did what we had to do but you
but you did things that were
optional Israel did what it had to do
because everybody knows self-defense is
legitimate
right
um but Iran didn't have to do with they
did which is funding the militants ETC
so Iran is the one that broke it they're
the one that broke Gaza so I think they
should take all of the
residents uh into Iran
proper they they should open the door
and say all right we ruined your country
Gaza so now you can live here and we'll
keep you alive until you you get
settled so I think that's what Israel
should do they should demand that Iran
take their IES and all the families and
everybody that they everybody whose life
they destroyed by funding Hamas so the
trouble is is Israel is
allowing they're allowing this situation
to be reframed as Israel destroyed
Gaza that's not exactly what's
happening Iran destroyed Gaza by funding
a situation which guaranteed Gaza would
be
destroyed Israel is just doing their
part they're they're doing the autom a
atic part well if you do this to us it's
kind of automatic that this is going to
happen so I think they can make the case
that uh ran should be feeding and
clothing and doing the health care for
everybody who's displaced and they
should be the permanent settlement for
all of
them and that that would be the fair and
only thing that could
work the only thing that wouldn't work
is rebuilding Gaza and repopulating it
like it used to
be that's the only you can't
do and and by the way everybody's
pretending like that's the only thing
that will happen like the International
Community is still pretending this like
this is like fantasy politics
again uh I saw Bill Amman this was a
while ago a few weeks ago he said you
know maybe Gaza could become the real
model City that's rebuilt and the Gaza
residents are are put back in and not
only do they go back but it's a better
situation it's like a model you know
amazing City you built with modern
wonders and stuff to which I
say that's fantasy Israel's never going
to let the the uh their enemies
repopulate who who thinks that's going
to happen so so there's this whole
fantasy you know belief about this two
State situation none of that's going to
happen that's like Michelle Obama being
president and RFK Jr being selected to
be vice president for Trump this is Pure
Fantasy yeah there they're not going to
rebuild Gaza the way it was so you got
to find something else there's a story
that says uh that Larry Fink the CEO of
Black Rock uh quote melted down on some
kind of uh earnings call and it was over
ESG and I guess black rocks losing money
because people are pulling their funds
because of
ESG specifically let's see who did it
specifically um there was the the Texas
permanent School fund pulled 8 and a
half billion from their management that
kind of hurts imagine having one entity
pull over8 billion out of your fund over
over
ESG so now the report was that Larry fin
quote melted down but I heard an audio
of it and it didn't sound all that melty
down to me he did
sound stressed but I wouldn't go all the
way to melt it down he he was just being
quite uh let's say assertive in his
opinion he wasn't too happy about it but
melted down n melted down is a whole
different standard I wouldn't I wouldn't
say he melted
down RFK Jr explains to us why uh NATO
is so hell bent on
expansion now you remember follow the
money explains
everything and do you remember when you
were confused about why why do we need
NATO to be every country when Russia
it's like the main thing they don't want
like Russia says there's just one thing
we definitely don't want just don't grow
NATO okay and we can make everything
else work just that one thing just one
thing don't increase NATO
so of course we're increasing NATO like
crazy and it turns out that there's a
financial reason for that are you
surprised here's the financial reason as
described by RFK Jr which immediately
made sense to me like all the everything
fell in place when you hear this for the
first time you're going to say to
yourself are you kidding me if
you've never heard this yet or I'm going
to tell you in a moment if you've never
heard this before and I never had
it's the first time I heard it was this
morning your head is going to explode
you ready for
this RFK Jr tells us that if a country
goes NATO the first thing that country
has to do is buy only NATO type
weapons because NATO needs to be
interoperable do you see it yet do you
know who sells all the NATO approved
weapons the United States
th this is all about building a weapons
building
entity and having a good reason for lots
of weapons well it's right on the border
there with Russia so of course they need
lots of weapons but they don't need our
weapons well if we make them NATO they
need our
weapons it it was always about selling
them
weapons that's all it
is you know and then the arguments about
you know Putin wanting to roll over
Europe probably all complete
probably and then Black Rock of course
uh and others will get the big contracts
to
rebuild so Ukraine is not just one thing
obviously the CIA wanted it to help them
conquer Russia and the energy people
wanted the fight so they could take
Russia's energy business and the weapons
people wanted them to be NATO so they
could sell NATO weapons
let me say something with uh no
ambiguity
whatsoever America is the bad guy are
you all aware of
that you know you know we are the bad
guy right like we're really bad like
we're so bad it's almost incalculable we
might be the worst country that ever
lived well Hitler and Stalin and Ma did
pretty bad maybe not worse than them or
I'll give you a pole pot too but we're
in the top 10 I mean the the the we
do to other countries just for
money is completely morally and
ethically bankrupt we're we're probably
the most morally and ethically bankrupt
country in the history of all
countries but does it work kind of you
know kind of as long as we have the
biggest military we can get rid of all
we can do all kinds of stuff
so
anyway um remember I predicted uh right
after Trump lost in
2020 uh I predicted that Trump would
look better every day he was out of
office and I saw Fox News was reporting
on a poll that uh people who remember
the years in office of Trump versus
Biden 42% remember Trump's years in
office as you know basically good mostly
good but only 25% think
uh Biden is mostly
good 25%
H 25% of the public thinks that Biden's
years are mostly good I think all 25%
are on
MSNBC did did you see Morning Joe Go
full mental illness about Trump
today oh my God that guy's got some
mental problems that he he's trying to
trying to sell us his professional
job anyway um
meanwhile axios has a scoop that
treasury secretary Janet Yellen is
preparing fresh sanctions on Iran
huh sanctions on Iran who does that
remind me of what leader wanted to build
a wall and have sanctions on
Iran H well it seems that uh Trump was
right about everything and now sanctions
on Iran looks like a good idea suddenly
doesn't it how about those sanctions on
Iran and maybe we should build a
wall Trump right on
everything
um then as you know the uh Republicans
are talking about how they have to have
more observers during election
night um so the Republicans think that
they need more lawyers and observers to
make sure that you have full
transparency for the election it's a
good idea don't you
think what would be your what what kind
of complaint could anybody have about
that could you even imagine what the
complaint would be like why would you
why would anybody complain about having
extra observers so that way you don't
have to wonder if the election was
rigged right what wasn't it terrible
that all the Republicans said hey I
think that election was rigged well you
could do away with with most of that by
making sure that everywhere there's a
Democrat there's also a
republican I'll tell you if you told me
there was a republican watching every
step of the process at the same time as
a Democrat I would say you know what a
lot of people say there's this system is
rigged but if you just tell me there's a
Republican and a Democrat watching every
vote I'm going to think maybe that
system
worked but apparently that was not the
case
apparently there there's quite a bit of
pressure to make sure that that there
are no Republicans watching who would
say such a crazy crazy thing that would
obviously oun you as a scoundrel and
obviously oun you as somebody who had
every intention of rigging an election
who in the world would be against
transparency and having both a Democrat
and a republican looking at every step
of the way who could possibly be against
that Mark Elias lawyer for the Democrats
said
for those who can't believe it yes the
right-wing groups are suing for the
right to harass election workers and
voters that's right Mark Elias the guy
famous for getting all the rules changes
that probably got Biden in elected in
the first place is saying that
transparency is really just Republicans
wanting to
hassle and harass the election
workers now could we have a show of
hands because I know there are a lot of
Republicans watching the stream how many
of you wake up in the morning and say to
yourselves you know there's one thing I
like even more than fair elections with
great
transparency I'd love to go down to an
election and just harass a Democrat on
Election
Day because I can I'm going to sue
somebody in fact I want to harass
somebody so badly that I'm going to sue
for the right to harass people
now is that the weakest lawyer argument
you've ever heard that transparency is
the same thing as
harassing he's actually trying to sell
that but more importantly he's trying to
sell that there should not be
transparency he he's the guy who knows
where all the bodies are
buried I'll bet you Mark Elias knows if
there's anything that say imperfect
about the
elections he would be the one who
knows probably more than any single
person in the world he'd probably
know and he thinks that lack of
transparency would be the better way to
go at least based on his comments it
seems that way aren't they telling us
directly they plan to
cheat how do you interpret this other
than we very much want to cheat and we
would hate it if you're
watching I I don't even have another way
to think of it like I I try to show you
both sides of things there's no both
sides of this one what is the both sides
of transparency lack of transparency no
the opposite of transparency is not
harassing
Democrats the opposite of transparency
is non-transparency
but he's trying to sell us that the
opposite of transparency is harassing
that is not that is not an argument
that's not even a good try but got
nothing else so let me ask you this why
when does a lawyer
lie when does a lawyer
lie now I know you're going to say when
their mouth is
moving funny but that's not what I'm
going for when does a lawyer
LIE there's only one there's only one
situation in which a lawyer
Lies when the truth doesn't
work when the truth doesn't work because
if the truth
worked why would you lie about it
because you want you want something that
works so a lawyer would have never have
a reason to lie when the truth
Works am I right is is Mark Elias
telling you the truth that this is about
harassing Democrats
does that sound like the truth to
you and if it's not the
truth why would a lawyer
lie only one
reason if he's lying and it looks looks
like an obvious lie to us but we can't
read his mind but if he's lying there's
only one
reason because the truth would be bad
for
him there's no other reason
right yeah had to say what his lips are
moving you had to say it all right
ladies and gentlemen that gives us the
conclusion of today's amazing show I'm
going to say goodbye to the platforms of
Facebook Rumble and X I'm going to stick
