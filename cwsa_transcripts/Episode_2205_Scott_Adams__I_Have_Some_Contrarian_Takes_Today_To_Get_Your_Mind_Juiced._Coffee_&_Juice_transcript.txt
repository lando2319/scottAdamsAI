over
good morning everybody and welcome to
what will surely be the highlight of
human civilization yeah you thought it
was Twitter or X but it's not it's not
it's a show and if you'd like to take it
up to levels that only the weekend can
survive well all you do is look up for a
mug or a glass of tanker chalices Diana
canteen Joker flask a vessel Liberty
guide fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
ah that was pretty good
pretty pretty good
so if you're not a subscriber on locals
or on X where you can see the Dilbert
reborn comic but only only there
um
the series is now about the boss
sending his employees onto the streets
to get things for him
when he lives in a city that has become
dangerous so the employees are
complaining about the danger coming to
work
and he just sent Tina to get his lunch
and I'll read it to you but it's
basically Tina she's a little unhappy
talking to the boss and she says
thanks for sending me through the
gauntlet of lawlessness to pick up your
lunch
I got 20 000 steps just for uh I got 20
000 steps just fleeing for my life
and the boss says you have a Fitbit
and Tina says I did but now it's the
property of a guy they call the midnight
Crapper
so you would not have seen that
when Dilbert was in newspapers so let me
say again that my uh my creative Revival
is really fun every every time I sit
down to to make the comic now
I'm enjoying it like I'm looking for
type oh I I'd love to write some Comics
today
every single day for 10 years at least
10 years prior to being canceled
I hated my job
now it was better than a real job
because I could just sit there drawing
pictures and stuff but
I didn't like it because you know
anything you like is great until you
have to do too much of it and if you
have to do a callback every single day
every day
you get tired of it after 25 years
so believe me getting canceled was like
I swear it was like being reborn I call
it dilber reborn moves like I was reborn
because I actually love my job
so by thoughts of Desperately wanting to
retire which I did prior to being
canceled I desperately
wanted to retire I just needed to find
the way to do it that wasn't the way
yeah it just happened but man it's good
it's good stuff
all right
and I ask you is can AI do that do you
think AI could have done that joke
do you think AI could have had a
punchline about the midnight crapper and
known that that was funny nope
not even a chance
all right I believe yesterday I talked
about somebody named Anthony Oliver who
doesn't exist but there is somebody
named Oliver Anthony do I have that
right now
did I correct that yet
so I'm now correct right first name
Oliver last name Anthony note two future
parents
if your last name already is like a
first name
don't give somebody a first name that's
like a last name
you got to make a choice
if it had been Eric Anthony would I have
been confused no Eric no nobody has a
last name of Eric that must be the first
name
but no Oliver Anthony
I believe his parents have a sense of
humor and they were sitting around what
should we name him and they said to
themselves well I've got an idea
how about a practical joke
instead of a regular name we're going to
give him a name that is
indistinguishable from a first or last
name to match with his existing last
name that's indistinguishable from her
first name do you think he's gonna have
a lot of explaining to do
well yes he will
oh apparently it's not his real name um
well this
somebody says that's not his real name
Christopher Anthony Lunsford
uh are you kidding me
that that's a that's not a real that's a
performance name
Oliver is his grandfather's name
well okay all right that makes more
sense
um may I say that his parents are now
off the hook
parents are in the clear you've cleared
them you've cleared the parents you know
it was here I was maligning the parents
as pranksters but no the problem was
mine entirely fake news
fake news got me again see now I think
this is why live stream is better than
recorded anything
because you you fact checked me in real
time
wasn't that useful I don't think there's
anything better technology wise than
getting fact checked while you're doing
it
that's sort of the Ultimate model
that's why I like the community notes
but uh more about that so he's he was
number one on uh I guess iTunes for the
world not just the country
and the story is that he turned down
eight billion dollars what do you think
of that turned down eight billion
dollars to I don't know commercializes
music with some publisher or other
now do you think that's awesome because
he was not interested in money you know
it was more about the message
or
or did he have good advisors Maybe
if I were his business advisor do you
think I would have let him taken a
million dollar first offer
oh if you're his advisor would you let
him take an eight million dollar offer
I would have chained him to his bed
before I would let him take that offer
I I would have physically restrained him
said look I know this isn't cool I'm
going to physically restrain you but
don't sign an eight million dollar offer
first of all
started it should start at 20.
right if he's even going to consider an
offer
it's 20. let's just be honest 8 million
was low the first offer you get before
somebody is you know fully emerged is
going to be the low one because they're
trying to get him early right they're
trying to get a discount we'll get him
before he knows what he's got here of
course you let that one go at the very
least you let it age
right at the very least you don't take
it the day it's offered you know you let
them see if they can enhance it maybe
see the competition if you get it here's
the best
you want you also have the best business
advice you'll ever hear
it comes
if somebody makes you an eight million
dollar offer and you're you're in the
news you know everybody knows you exist
but you've got one offer for eight
million dollars tell me the odds that
you would get a second offer soon
but what percentage odds
do you think you would get a second
offer
it's a hundred percent yeah it's a
hundred percent there isn't any chance
you won't get a second third fourth
offer right so if you were if you
considered a first offer that's just bad
business
that's bad business
so here's what
I'd like to think about him
don't know that it's true
but if you saw the quality of the
writing and the song
and then you add that to the quality of
um the performance
and then you add that to the equality of
his commentary because he he drove in
his car and he was he was talking about
his situation
you can really see
that he's smart can you not
he's not a normal just average Joe he's
actually smart I'm going to say smarter
than the average person it's kind of
obvious
and if somebody who's smarter than the
obvious the average person turns down an
offer
just just put that in the context that
was the offer I would have turned down
as well
doesn't mean he'll ever take an offer he
might just stay independent
I mean does he really need anybody
what would somebody do for him that he
can't do for himself
I don't know usually usually it's
somebody trying to make you famous but
if you start as the most famous artist
in the world number one on iTunes in the
entire world if you start there then the
value of helpers goes way down but they
probably want to take you know 50 to 75
percent of his of his earnings
would be my guess
all right so I tweet by Elon Musk
which just said uh X meaning Twitter as
Humanity's Collective consciousness
do you see it
do you see acts as societies meaning you
know its existence the way it is as
society's Collective consciousness
I totally do yeah
have you ever heard of any books
that would have a similar concept
well if you haven't read my book God's
debris
this would be to the time to connect all
the dots the people on my Local's
platform have more of a backstory there
but uh let me just actually could you
even buy that I think God's debris is
canceled
if you were on the locals platform you
could read it for free because it's
available there for free the ebook part
yeah I think I think God's base canceled
at the moment you could get a used one
but uh just remember uh if you read it
remember Elon musk's tweet
about X being the common Consciousness
and then it will blow your mind when you
read God's debris
uh speaking of books my book reframe
your brain
is still not available well it's not
approved yet by Amazon
for the physical book
now the physical book is done and
submitted they just have to say yes for
some reason it takes a few days
I don't know if there's a problem yet
but by the end of today if it's not
there I'm going to assume there is a
problem
uh however here's the good news the uh
the reviews the Amazon reviews are just
off the chart
so the the people who are reading it are
just having their minds blown which is
what I imagined would happen
so my mind's blown I mean that people
are seeing their life changing in
fundamental ways
even while reading the book they can
actually feel the change
some people are wearing out their
highlighter
so it's a it's not like a regular book
it's it's a book you're going to want to
highlight keep around show to people
refer back to
so that the physical book I actually
recommend
normally normally I'd say get the Kindle
because you know who needs a book on
their Shelf
but
if
you want this book I'd wait for the soft
cover I wouldn't wait for the hard to
cover soft cover will come before the
hardcover in my case
all right
so that's going you know I gotta say
you're just like inside baseball uh
author thing
when you spend two years working on a
book which I did
and it ruins
kind of ruins two years of your life
normally it's a year but it was a busy
year so it took me a little longer but
if you put a year of your life into
basically removing all of your
entertainment time so that you basically
are just working
for a year
you want that book to do well right so
you want it to you know do well in the
rankings and make money and all that
stuff but I got to tell you that there's
a thing that's even better than that
as good as money is
when the reviews come in and they're
stellar
like that's when I feel like I'm done
you know anything else that happens
after that is like Ah that's great I'm
glad that happened
but when the reviews come in and they're
just through the roof
that's that's the payoff that's because
I wrote it to be useful I didn't write
it to be entertaining I don't know if
you thought if you thought I did it's
not it's not meant to be entertaining
per se you know it should have it should
be entertaining too but it should change
lives and people are saying this so
there you go
there you go more about that later
um I saw a funny uh tweet by uh uh
Oregon
MJ
and she's a woman and she says my
favorite thing about men is how they're
completely incapable of responding to
multiple questions over text whatever
you asked last is the only thing they'll
acknowledge
does anybody have that experience ladies
do you have an experience that men will
only answer one of the questions you ask
um I I had to go public and I know men
don't be mad at me men don't be mad
I know I violated the secret oath of men
by telling women one of our secrets
but
I thought I had to make an exception
this time
so I retweeted and I commented uh we're
trying to train you to ask one question
how many men said my God that's exactly
what I'm doing
come on
how many of you admit it how many of the
men say okay you got me that's exactly
what I'm doing I'm trying to train her
to ask one question
yeah I've done that
oh yeah I've intentionally ignored
questions
try to train them
all right
um the exception would be business if I
get a text for a business I don't mind
multiple questions because you know why
not uh and then and then somebody in the
and there was a woman in the comments
this just made me laugh until I cried
she said that
she had tried to you know she'd heard
the same thing that men like one one
question per text so she'll send
multiple questions and multiple texts at
the same time so that each question is
in its own text
was that exactly getting to the heart of
the problem
and I loved I love that you know men and
women are so different
that even when I say directly I'm trying
to train you to ask one question
that the way it was heard was oh so I'll
just ask 10 questions in individual text
at the same time and we're good right
no no that wasn't exactly the spirit of
that all right
here we go uh have I ever told you that
all news about public figures is fake
news
yes I have and the reason I've told you
that is because all news about public
figures is fake now it always starts
with something true you know somebody is
sick probably true don't know what
somebody died somebody got married those
are usually true
but all of the why somebody did it the
the background the interpretation the
context all fake all fake all the time
not always intentionally
let's see if you can pick this one out
on your own okay
so there's a story in The Insider which
used to be called The Business Insider
about RFK Jr's voice issues is a
disorder called spasmodic dysphonia and
The Insider reports that it is an
incurable disorder
why did they report that it's an
incurable disorder
do you think I sound like RFK Jr right
now
does anybody think I talk just the way
he does right now
nope
do you know that I had that same
disorder it's called spasmodic dysphonia
and that I had surgery
and it was cured that's why when you're
listening to me right now it sounds like
a pretty normal voice
and the reason I got the surgery is
because I was referred to other people
who had the surgery
so I talked to them in in person I mean
by phone but personally I talk to them
and they could all speak fine
they could all speak fine
so there was in fact and there has been
for now many years 10 years 15 years a
surgery that is a complete cure
suppose you were to look it up I'd like
you to do this right now if anybody has
a second browser open look for treatment
or cure of spasmodic dysphonia tell me
what comes up
treatment or cure of spasmodic dysphonia
do it right now do it right now now
remember the Cure has been available
for about 10 or 15 years
and I've been public about how I did it
do the existence of it what do you find
what is recommended as sometimes it's
called the gold standard
well I think if you look it up you're
going to find that um there's no cure
but that Botox injections through the
front of the neck
into the back of the neck in other words
they're reaching to the back of the neck
but they have to go through the front
uh into your vocal cords can give you
some relief
WebMD says there's no cure WebMD
says there's no cure I'm literally
talking to you cured
right so what you're going to find
is that most most standards will say
there's no cure but people often use
botox
to get a better result you know better
than what they had
now
what do you think is happening
you know for sure 100 sure it's curable
because you're listening to me live
and I have a very long history of you
know talking about it before I was cured
not talking but writing about it and
and now you find that if you check the
the the news not just the news but if
you search on Google it's going to say
that there's a Pharma product a big I
don't know big but a big form of product
that's the only thing you can do about
it
have you put it together yet is anybody
connected to the dots
all right
um there was a organization that's like
the umbrella Organization for this
situation spasmodic dysphonia so a bunch
of people had that condition and some
people who treated it got together and
they've created a like a an organization
if you search for it it'll probably be
one of the first things that comes up
who do you think gives them funding to
support their organization
oh I don't know
can you take a guess
yeah
it's exactly what you think it is
it put your conspiratorial hat on
there is a cure
but the news won't tell you and if you
search for it you can't find it
what does it remind you of
now remember this happened before the
pandemic so this is the same thing you
know for years it's always been like
this
well I've Rebecca
it's exactly what you think it is
it's exactly what you think it is
the news
is not even close to real
now can you believe this this is about a
major candidate
now here's the back story on RFK Jr
he did get a medical procedure
but it's not the one I got
he did research and he learned he
learned about mine because I I told him
about it a long time ago
and he decided to get something that had
a easier recovery which is a reasonable
decision so his decision actually made
sense because he did get some
improvement that's quite substantial uh
enough to get him through maybe the
political season if he had done my
surgery he'd have a year or two of weak
voice wouldn't it wouldn't have worked
for politics at all
so it does take a long there's a long
recovery period
um but can you imagine that the news
doesn't even mention
so when you read anything about a
political figure even something like as
basic as a medical situation
not real
it's just not real
once you realize how not real the news
is you can never you could never unsee
it
all right China's population another
news that the fertility is dropped
below Japan's level which was you know
Japan had the the same problems are
having the same problem it's even lower
now that's from the official numbers
from China
so the official numbers from China say
that their birth rate is basically a
severe emergency
do you think they gave you the right
number
do you think China is telling you the
real number
probably the fake number shows an
emergency imagine how bad the real
number is if if there is one
imagine
so China is in bad bad trouble and the
other thing is there that I don't hear
enough about is that there are way too
many men aren't there
like how would they fix that if there
are way too many men for women because
all that matters is the number of women
it doesn't matter the number of men
yeah we'll talk about Maui
um
so they're they're in big trouble
um
can you remind me did I say on live
stream or did I only say it to my
private
private group on the man cave did I tell
you the vivec Vivek ended the risk of
war with China over Taiwan
it did yeah I'll just say it again in
case I missed it would Vivek said that
um Taiwan is critical to the United
States because it's the only place we
can get the advanced chips he basically
said there's there's nothing you can do
to take Taiwan because that's that's a
red line blah blah but once we can make
those chips ourselves in the United
States then he would see it as more of a
Civil War which would suggest
that China and Taiwan are gonna have to
work it out on their own
why would China ever attack Walter vague
is still in the race and other people
are nodding their heads to that because
I doubt anybody said oh that's a bad
idea
do you don't you think everybody heard
that said yeah that makes sense
yeah yeah right now it's critical you
better not touch it but if you just
waited and then you add on top of that
the China is the most patient country in
the history of all countries
you know they they have like a 100 or a
thousand year idea for China so seven
years eight years it would just make
sense to wait
you know even if you're sure you wanted
to make a move on Taiwan
unless you're going to do it right away
like before or during the presidential
races which would be a scary possibility
I don't see them getting ready to do it
though
because all hell would break loose and I
don't think that they can handle all
hell with breaking loose given their
other problems I think China is too weak
honestly I think they're too weak
and I don't think you know if they're
stronger in eight years maybe that would
be the thing to wait for if they were
them
that's what I do
um so I guess uh Trump is going to be
interviewing with Tucker
Carlson at the same time as the fox
debates do I have that right give me a
fact check on that there would be
televised both live
so would Tucker Be Live or recorded
that part I don't know can somebody get
disabled now if Tucker will be live or
recorded
because I feel like it would be recorded
and edited
because I don't know that because it
would be streamed on Twitter
live okay uh let me give a just a feel
for the audience if you had a choice of
which one to watch live let's say maybe
you record the other one
um
which one will you watch live
go which one will you watch live
uh almost all Trump Tucker now is that
because you're mad at Fox News
because I would go the other way
so I would watch here's my take on it
this is just personal so this this is
not a recommendation or anything it's
just the way I'll do it I feel like
Trump talking to Tucker I've already
seen
you know what I mean
I I wouldn't really expect a surprise
now Trump might come up with a surprise
because he's smart enough to know that
would that would be the thing that would
suck all the energy away from Fox News
but
I don't know that he has one you know
what could he say that we haven't
already heard so
I am really curious about watching Vivek
dismantle the other uh Republicans
so to me the the real show is Vivek
because he's the wild card in all this
everybody else is some version of Mike
Pence am I right
it's like Vivek versus Mike Pence Mike
Pence the other Mike Pence the woman
Mike Pence you know the black Mike Pence
but basically it's just a bunch of Mike
Pence's and then Vivek now that's the
show
now given that there will be lots of
people there how many people are going
to be in the debate too many right too
many to be a proper debate it's just
everybody gets their little thing to say
all right well I think I'm going to
watch the debate
and record Tucker but most of you are
going to do the opposite right
or not even watch the debate because
it's on Fox and you're all mad at him or
something
all right let me ask you this
do you think you're helping yourself by
not watching Fox News
are you helping yourself
people say yes
it helps you not to watch them
because what because you're punishing
them
how does it help you
well what am I doing wrong all right I
need some help here tell me what I'm
doing wrong
I turn on Fox News
I watched the five my favorite show
and then I'm all happy
what did I do wrong
like why doesn't that work for you
because you don't like the network
I'm not even sure what the problem is
because they've lied in the past you say
but how does that make the five less
entertaining
if I'm watching Gutfeld in the evening
what does anything that Fox News did in
the past have to do with that
yeah I don't I don't feel like I feel
like you're kind of boycotting
members of your own team
I get that you're mad at them for
whatever they did or didn't do but how's
that good for you
I don't think of your own I would say
this think of your own self-interest
that's probably more important than any
any statement you're going to make
all right
um
well that'll be fun uh Elon Musk tweeted
that he's going to get rid of the block
feature on x
what do you think happened when he said
he's going to get rid of the block
feature well let's talk about that I
don't know that it's going to happen
because it was a pretty big response
about it but it probably will probably
will
his argument I'm guessing
his argument I'm guessing
would be that free speech is free speech
and it's a free speech platform
but I'm not sure that trolls are a free
speech question are they
trolls it's more like you have freedom
to walk down the street but if somebody
bangs you in the head while you're
walking down the street you weren't as
free as you thought
now I will um I'm going to Echo
something that zooby said about this
which is if you have a smallish you know
normal Twitter account this is a good
idea for you
if you have a big account
lots of followers like zubi uh it's a
problem
because you just you you end up
attracting accidentally just the ugliest
messaging in the world now it's so ugly
that it would prevent me from looking at
your comments on my own my own timeline
so one of the things that I like about
my my experience on X is that I can
tweet something and then I look at all
the different comments and people agree
and disagree and because I've blocked so
heavily up to this point
I almost always get
reasonably good or debates in my
comments has anybody noticed
maybe you don't block the people I do so
it doesn't look that way but my own
experience of it is that I don't get too
many of the just evil trolls I get more
people who just disagree and they've got
a different data source and that stuff's
great
so I would say that my experience would
be degraded
if you took blocking away from me and by
the way blocking gives me a dopamine hit
so when the trolls take my dopamine away
and I'm like
I feel icky then I hit the block
my dopamine returns
so I use the block literally as a mental
health tool
and that's not an analogy
that's actually the literal thing I'm
doing my mind is not feeling good I just
read a troll
a block at my mind is cleared
and then I go on with my day it's
actually literally no joke
an important part of my mental health
that's not that's not any hyperbole it's
an important part of my mental health
now
but the counter argument is this
who cares about you
which is a pretty good argument
the best character argument is who cares
about you
because you're one of the You Know Rich
big accounts almost anybody with a small
account you know who wanted more
exposure would trade places
you know wouldn't the people with a
thousand followers if they could trade
places that with me to have a million
and have more trolls well not everybody
but a lot of people what
so on one hand I I hate this change and
it would make me feel
way less happy about my experience on
the other hand
musk's argument is a populist argument
most people on Twitter are smaller
accounts and they would like to have
their say
free speech is a isn't it
free speech is a
and I'm going to come down on this
where I haven't seen anybody else come
down on it
removing blocking would be absolutely
bad for my experience and my mental
health
I don't know if it would be bad for
people with small accounts and they're
the vast majority
why would my preference be more
important than a vast majority of people
is not it's just not because I have
freedom to use it or not use it read the
comments or not read the comments I have
lots of freedom
so it's really it really comes down to
my problem doesn't it
do you do I think that the vast number
of Twitter users
should be degraded in their experience
in other words they're ones getting
blocked should should I degrade all of
their experience so I can get my little
you know little benefit
but I think the the fairest thing I can
do is say what my feeling is and what my
opinion is and then let Elon Musk run
his company
because I don't feel I'm smart enough to
judge this one I feel this is just
the the weight of the public needs to
win so here's how I would come down to
this if most of the people on Twitter
like this idea because of the ones
getting blocked as opposed to what else
um I I would reluctantly
agree that
musk is not making a bad decision
at least to test it you know what do I
always say
you don't have to decide if it's a good
or bad idea
if you can test it you don't have to
decide
and Twitter is sort of the ultimate
example of that they they could you know
just set aside the code that allows you
to block but you know don't delete it
obviously and just keep it ready
run an experience where everybody's
unblocked for a while see what happens
people like it people don't like it and
then and then make a decision from there
so if you're thinking that if you
believe that musk has made a decision
that is unreversible I don't think you
understand software it's very reversible
you've seen them experiment quite a bit
on the interface so it's very reversible
but when he makes a statement that he's
going to get rid of it that gets him all
the feedback and attention he needs
to make a better decision but I think
you'll probably test it
if I were him I'd test it even if there
was a big you know yelling at first I'd
test it I think you will
all right um
we'll see
so here's a good test of your conspiracy
mind so Laura Loomer who's probably one
of the the most canceled people on the
planet who's not me
um
she is she has all kinds of she's had
problems from banking to social networks
and but she's allowed on Twitter and uh
she has a pretty big account
and uh she gets 200 to 400 million
impressions but she only got like a I
don't know some tiny little amount of
payoff from being a
a Twitter uh or an ex user who had
signed up for monetization
so she thought that she was being maybe
suppressed in some way
because her first payoff was small what
do you think so the only thing we know
is that an account her size would
normally have I'll give you numbers just
for decision making these are not the
real numbers but they're approximate an
account her size might be expected to
make five to seven thousand dollars a
month from Twitter ad payments
her actual payment instead of five to
seven thousand was closer to under two
hundred dollars
and she's seen other people advertise
what they got from from X and so she's
like hey what's going on I have this
much engagement but I got like five
percent of that what's going on all
right you tell me this is the only thing
we know so far
you tell me is there something going on
or is she being traded exactly like
everybody else what do you think
what what's your best speculation with
limited information
speculate with limited information
thank you Erica the correct answer is no
clue
yeah the the amount that you as an
observer can tell about this situation
is nothing
there's nothing I I will add one thing
to it
which when I got my first uh check for
having advertisements in x
it looked to me like way smaller than
other accounts My Size because they had
been publishing their their numbers and
I think uh Ian miles Chong had or
somebody had published and I looked at
the size of his account and engagement
and I looked at mine and I thought they
should be kind of similar
but I got like this little peanut and he
got a pretty sizable check
and so the first month I said to myself
the same as Laura Loomer I said
something going on here
I wasn't even I wasn't even sure that I
was registered in the system I thought
maybe I was confusing it with some other
payment or something it was so small
so
the second payment
was totally in the range of what I would
have expected right
so the second one was fine now my guess
is that Laura Loomer will have the same
experience that the second check will be
somewhere in the range of what you'd
expect the first one might have been a
partial partial month right
might have been a partial month
or there could be a bug about the first
month
or something like that but I don't think
that Elon Musk is suppressing her now
here's the argument for yes
don't you think that Twitter uh deal
works with advertisers and do you think
the advertisers do not ever say
don't pair us with some kinds of content
do you think that's ever happened
because that's what the the YouTube
model is the YouTube model is it's not
really YouTube That's Banning people
it's mostly the advertisers say we don't
want to be associated with that kind of
content
so what if what if Laura Loomer is right
but by the way I'm not debunking her
claim if it sounded like that then I
went too far I'm not debunking your
claim I'm saying we literally have no
idea it's just a mystery on the first
month the mystery will go away if the
second month is normal it would just
mean there's something about the first
month
but
would you if you were an Advertiser
would you say why don't you pair me with
Laura Loomer type material
yeah so she might actually be on some
kind of a blacklist
and we wouldn't know about it but I
think that's a fair question for Elon
Musk isn't it I haven't seen anybody
asking the question but the question
would be are you are you uh satisfying
advertisers in any way with a with a
blacklist
I would think they would have to it
seems like it's almost required
I don't know how you could not do it
honestly
if they could convince uh
if there was a way to convince the
advertisers that it doesn't matter
that'd be awesome here's how I would do
it if I were if I were a musk I would
say this
no we're we're a free speech platform
and that means you would be on you know
in the sheets of people you loved and
people you hated but people on Twitter
understand that so that would be the
best argument the people on Twitter
understand
that wherever they see it is not an
indication of being paired now if they
paired it with a tweet
that would be a problem pairing it with
the comments to the Tweet will just as
often pair it with somebody saying Laura
Loomer you're the worst person in the
world which maybe they agree with
so uh I I think I think Twitter has a
good argument better than YouTube an
argument that because the ads are
randomized that's much different than
YouTube now imagine YouTube there's an
hour-long video
and you're associated with that if
you're an Advertiser you don't want to
be associated with like an hour long
like bad content
but a tweet is fleeting right it's one
of a hundred things that person did that
day so you can make the argument on
Twitter that ads are randomized
sufficiently the people don't even don't
even really associate them with the the
Tweeter which I think is true have you
ever Associated an ad you saw on X with
the person who tweeted
I don't think it's ever even occurred to
me no it's never even never crossed my
mind
but I definitely have had those feelings
about YouTube
where I go oh that's a weird ad to be
associated with this content never had
that thought with Twitter because it's a
sufficiently randomized
so we'll see
well the foreshadowing has begun both
CNN Jake Tapper and the Washington Post
who he quoted his story uh say that
Trump was right about Biden taking money
from China
so they actually showed the clip of
trump saying the thing that Biden said
is not true and then they said no Biden
was wrong now Jake Tapper actually gave
Biden the out that maybe he didn't know
what his son was doing
so they're calling it quote a blind spot
that may be Biden that Joe Biden might
have had a blind spot for what his son
was doing
and then they had on Andy Levin who's a
Democrat and he said
keep in mind this was yes yesterday
he said there's no whiff of Joe Biden
being involved in Hunter's business
there's no whiff
really
really yeah you haven't picked up any
little whiff
not a whiff
nothing
uh now imagine how much of a bubble a
news bubble you would have to be in to
hear this guy say there's not a whiff of
Joe Biden being involved now obviously
he's talking about the paper trail but
it's a that's a pretty big stretch given
all that we know that is well confirmed
to say that there's not a whiff
it would be fair to say it would be fair
to say there's no paper trail
I haven't seen one not not that has his
name on it and it would be fair to say
uh I don't know of a specific crime
that's you know suggested
um or at least that's proven
but to say there's not a whiff come on
but here the bigger story was not that
because of course the pundits are going
to say what pundits do but imagine that
both the Washington Post and CNN
which you know are not real news
entities right
if I say Washington Post and CNN your
brain should automatically say oh the
fake news people
right they're they're the chief fake
news people in in politics right now
um both of them are saying Biden light
they're both saying Biden lied about
something that kind of matters doesn't
it
and then also we saw on what was it Face
the Nation or what was it no Meet the
Press which was it uh could be a fact
Jack who who was uh Dean representative
Dean Phillips went on and he was
encouraging people to get into the
Democratic primary
it was NBC wasn't it
give me a fact check on that I think it
was NBC the reason the reason I say that
is the NBC
would be another signal for a good news
Watchers
what would it tell you
if NBC if well actually it was one
person but they probably knew what he
was going to say
it was Meet the depressed
all right well I think I got that story
right so if it was NBC uh there are
people like Glenn Greenwald for example
who say that they're in an intelligence
CIA news Outlet
so if that's true
that would suggest that the intelligence
people
might be okay with getting rid of Biden
and if CNN and Washington post's
coverage of it of Biden being the liar
uh is suggesting that they're very done
with them but they don't know what to do
with the Kamala Harris problem
so I think all indications are basically
a hundred percent of the evidence
suggests Democrats are trying to get rid
of Biden would you agree
100 of available evidence
suggests they want to get rid of them
and it's obvious that Kamala Harris is
the problem would you agree
I I feel like this is opinion but its
opinion is so close to obvious there's
like just one degree away from fact
you know anything could be wrong I
suppose I could be wrong but I mean this
looks as clear as anything ever has ever
looked if if we're wrong about this I'd
be amazed
all right um have you noticed do you
remember when uh
DeSantis was just being a governor
before he was running for president
and I kept being amazed at how he would
find one thing after another to make
news that was like a useful thing for
his base you know the other side would
scream but like lots of little useful
news-making little things and he was
just always in the news doing one smart
thing after another
smart defined as
doing things in space once
now have you noticed that that same
pattern exists in another Floridian
Matt Gates
have you noticed how many times Matt
Gates
finds a topic or an issue that you
didn't even know was one
but as soon as he says it's an issue you
say oh yeah that is kind of an issue and
then he says what he wants to do about
it not not always successful
but he'll say I'm using this tool of
government to try to kill this thing and
every time I hear it I think oh yeah
that is a thing that needs to get killed
well he's at it again
um
he's calling on Congress to investigate
the judge who's going to be judging
Trump and I guess the
uh in one of the cases judge Tanya
and apparently she is somewhat Infamous
for giving extra hard uh
extra hard sentences to the January 6
people
now my head just exploded
I just told you that Trump will have the
same judge who is well known for uh
unusually hard
sentences for the January 6 people
is that who you want and then it goes
further Matt Gates also accuses her of
supporting the 2020 black lives matter
protests some of which were violent
while at the same time openly
criticizing the capital riot
so he thinks this Rises to the level
where the judge should be called before
Congress
and I agree
and I agree
that's absolutely what what he should do
and by the way who who even thought of
this
who else thought of it
now you might say to yourself but Scott
this would be a bad precedent it'd be a
terrible precedent to have the Congress
you know interfering in this but not in
this case in this case this is a purely
political situation and that's
congress's job
the political stuff right if I thought
this was only
about the law and the crime
then I'd say oh Matt Gates stay the hell
away from the judges right you know good
or bad you don't want your Congress
messing with the judges right this is
about the law or about a crime you know
you're about to make in the laws you you
stay over there
but this is not anything like a criminal
case this is only a political thing in
in the opinion of at least 50 to 60
percent of the public is purely
political
in that case this is exactly the right
move
and uh
he just keeps doing it
why is it that Matt Gates keeps doing
productive for his base
productive
interesting news-making things
all right when was the last time
DeSantis did that
when was the last time desensis did one
of those signature like good Governor
things
it's been a while hasn't it
it's been a while
you know what it feels like
it feels like that for a while they had
the same advisor
but now DeSantis doesn't
feels to me like it feels to be like
DeSantis lost a key advisor
who is
may be friends with Matt Gates
or or
Matt Gates was the key advisor
for DeSantis
ah
and that maybe they were a little closer
when it was about Florida but now that
it's about the presidency Matt Gates you
know peels off pro-trump and just keeps
doing his thing
so so at the moment that Matt Gates
peels off from you know Florida business
to National Business
that's the same moment that DeSantis
stops his string of great political acts
that are good for the base but Matt gase
keeps doing them
there's something there
um
I'm going to give you the optimism which
is unwarranted but you like it anyway
can I have your permission to give you
unwarranted optimism with the
understanding that you're going to say
that's not Scott you're no no I'm not
seeing it yet
all right so I want you to enjoy this as
recreational optimism
right the real optimism would be like
based on facts and stuff like that this
is recreational optimism
our long National brainwashing nightmare
looks like it's starting to end
and what I mean by that the national
brainwashing nightmare
is that the country was having a a
divide
that was primarily based on race and
gender stuff
and that the real problem with the
country is that the races are hurting
each other and competing
and then
Oliver Anthony or whatever his real name
is does the song and you see it affects
people in an economic you know group
exactly the same no matter who they are
do you think that that song had less
impact on a I know anybody on the left
probably not it seemed to be impactful
for for people there now as Chappelle
and other smart people comedians have
been saying it forever it has never been
a race question the race thing is
brainwashing
in the past it was the realest thing
there could be you know during slavery
the the race issue was the realest thing
it could be during all of the years
after that including up till today still
lots of real stuff
real systemic racism real racism of
every kind less and less and less
but still you know a serious issue
however
we should be smart enough now to know
that if we switch
from a race versus race which we've been
talked into by obviously people who
don't want us to to know that it's about
money because we would take their money
um
I feel like people have figured out that
it's the age of the individual
we are starting to
enjoy what I would call
if I could give it a label the big
reframe
the big reframe
is when we realize that if we treat each
other as individuals
everything works
if we treat each other as part of the
average of some conceptual group that
somebody in charge wants us to get all
the worked up about then we fight each
other and that was never the point
we're all on the same side
except the people have the most power
and and uh and money
now I'm I'm sort of in a weird hybrid
situation you know where I came from not
much money
to you know be well off but I'm
definitely not in the um uh the
BlackRock you know uh military
industrial complex like I don't have any
connection to the intelligencia or
whoever it is who's running everything I
don't have any wef
Soros connections like I don't have any
of that right so so I'm an observer just
like everybody else who's not an elite I
guess
um so I'm an observer from this from The
Observer perspective
not only is the word reframe
uh having a Renaissance
but once the word and the idea of
reframing things
becomes more popularized which is what
my book is doing at the moment uh
reframe reframe your brain once you see
that reframing is sort of a go-to thing
that everybody has access to oh I can
look at that differently and if I did
would that give me more tools just
looking at it differently does that open
up some opportunities and this is the
ultimate this is the big reframe
everything that's wrong with the country
is because we were we were hypnotized
and brainwashed into a frame that black
people and white people are fighting
each other
and you know lgbtq against the world and
stuff like that and the moment we get
out of that frame and say what about
everybody is infinitely and uniquely
different from everybody else because
that's the truth
do you think there's such a thing as a
black guy
we act like there is
of course there's not there's infinite
Variety in Black Americans as there is
infinite Variety in Asian Americans
Hispanic Americans now white Americans
we all do eat cheese and wear a khakis
that I mean
there's nothing I can do about that so
white people we are all exactly the same
and when we dance it's a little like
this
no that's not true either is it
but did you notice that I can just laugh
about it
I can laugh it's just funny yeah I I do
eat a lot of cheese and I am not a good
dancer true
right now if we get to the point where
everybody can laugh about their thing
like and I'm not even going to say what
anybody else's thing is but if you're
Hispanic American
and you can lie about whatever your
thing is can we all just you know
understand that it never applies to
everybody
nothing about a group applies to all the
people you know period That's the big
reframe here's so my recreational
optimism is this that Oliver Anthony was
not
just the cause of something meaning a
cause of us thinking differently he was
the sign that we're already there
he was the sign that that door cracked
open
he he kicked the door down
but it was cracked like people were
already starting to say hey this
pandemic
I don't think that was totally legit
right the the pandemic also reoriented
us toward
uh
uh is it possible that everything we've
been told is a lie and the answer is
everything important you've been told is
a lie
absolutely everything important was a
lie
still is
but
if we can find our way to the big
reframe which by the way you'd have to
get past the big lie
the big lie is what's one of the things
you know the so-called big lie is what's
keeping you from the big reframe
is keeping you from Elon musk's View
that Twitter could be the common
consciousness
in other words Twitter is the one place
that I can go and see that black
Americans and white Americans watch
Oliver Anthony and have the same
reaction
did you see it on the NBC News
did you see it on ABC News did you see
it on CNN nope you did see it on Fox
News
they did cover it
but anything discovered in one you know
in one news you know Silo isn't really
the thing that's moving the country
but I think we're there
so the ultimate reframe is coming
and RFK Jr is part of this as well
because he's pushing the middle class
Revival and his messaging is on fire
right I mean RFK Jr is just great
at messaging
and so now you've got RFK saying hey
this is the left
remember this is the important part
don't miss us he's a Democrat there's a
Democrat telling you that you've been
brainwashed by
the powers
and I don't know if he's getting through
but keep in mind both the right and the
left are now seeing that the big reframe
is necessary
all right
let's talk about Hawaii uh it's been how
many days
10 days or a week or something they're
still they say over a thousand missing
the official numbers of 111. nobody
thinks that's close
nobody
that I'm going to tell you something
that what I was holding on to before but
I've seen it on Twitter so now I guess
I'll tell you I think the big reason
that um
we don't have a better estimate of death
is because they would have to break it
out by children and adults
and we're not ready to hear it that's
what I think
I think the percentage of the
thousand-ish that are missing
the the percent that are children
will cause a national depression
I I think the mental health of the
country can't handle this news
and I think that this is a case where
the cats on the roof is perfectly
acceptable
we need to get used to this
well you've got to get prepared for
what's coming
you're going to get some news that might
be the worst news you've ever heard in
the country it might be the
you know I mean there are a lot of
competitors for that but it might be the
worst thing you've ever heard
um so just get ready mentally prepare
for that
Rand Paul was tweeting that Rutgers
college is requiring freshmen to get
fully vaccinated
in 2023
imagine being accepted to college
and you're all set to go yeah I'm going
to Rutgers good school
and they tell you you have to get
vaccinated in 2023.
why would you even want to go to that
school I wouldn't want to go to a school
that understood
something
like this is the school that you're
supposed to learn things
and they're they're requiring required
vaccination for young healthy males
especially
right I mean everybody they want but the
males are more at risk I guess
amazing like it's just jaw-droppingly
amazing that Rutgers can still stay in
business
I don't think there would be anything
better for the country than all of our
colleges going out of business
because we would reform education I mean
we wouldn't stop educating people but
but there would be startups and there
would be online and it would be you know
self-organized educational groups there
was something would happen but I swear
to God we should just make College
illegal because all it is is making our
students stupid
you don't send people to college and
work up a half a million dollar debt to
make your kid the idiot but
that's what's happening
all right
um
let me
I just have to do this because I know my
audience hates it
but
I'm going to mention some things that
Joe Biden's Administration might be
getting really right
it's early it's too early
but just kind of kind of hold these in
your head at the same time so I
mentioned that there might be something
happening with an Iran deal
that finally
could be so you know let's say
rationally put together that even the
Benjamin Netanyahu is saying at least in
the broad brushes of it even then Yahoo
was saying they could probably live with
it
so if you could do an Iran deal
that Israel could live with and it looks
like that's actually a possibility right
now
that's huge
now I would say you know if you if you
want to be political about it you could
say that the Biden Administration is
benefiting
from what the Trump Administration
started which was pressure on Iran to
the point where they had to negotiate it
just happens to be now
because that seems to be why they're
getting flexible they're literally
running out of cash
the way the rules work I don't make the
rules but the rule the rules say that if
a good thing happens during your
Administration
people say at least you didn't break it
you know you get some credit for that
but we're also saying that the China
sanctions from the Biden Administration
are pretty serious
actually more than I might have expected
and I don't have a real problem
with Biden's treatment of China
I actually thought that Trump should
have done more if I would compare
Biden's treatment of China to trumps I
would say you know Trump probably got
the ball rolling and I think Trump
reframed China would you agree with that
Trump reframed
what China was
where they are
trading partner that is a requirement
for our future that's what it used to be
and now there are adversary who is
stealing our stuff
Trump did that
I would like to think I helped
you know there were a lot of people on
that page but I like to think I did my
my part
but I would say that
in my opinion Biden is getting tough on
fentanyl you know they're they're moving
against the fentanyl dealers they're
cutting them off
um so I don't have a big complaint about
Biden in China right now it does look
like they're getting serious about this
and then the Russia thing you you're
going to see it entirely through a
political filter but if I could be
objective about it
um we're spending too much money running
up debt uh risking nuclear war everybody
knows the bad side
so I don't need to reiterate all the bad
things about being involved but
it did look to me and I think they've
said it directly that the real play here
is not Ukraine the real play is
degrading Russia as a competitor both
militarily and economically and
especially as a competitor in the energy
segment
and it looks like that's going to happen
my guess is that there will be some
negotiated end eventually
so the war will stop but when it's over
Russia won't be Russia anymore
the United States will still largely be
the United States but Russia won't be
Russia
and if if you were you know real uh
Machiavellian and neocon I guess
and you said to yourself if we can if we
can do this set of actions around
Ukraine
that has the following outcomes we're
going to be better off even at the cost
of a trillion dollars and that would be
degrading permanently our biggest
problem in the world that is in China
which we're also handling
but also proving that our military
assets are so dominant over the military
assets of a potential foe that it makes
them completely get out of the game and
just say all right we just watched what
the United States did to Russia
without putting a boot on the ground
did it with Ukrainian fighters who were
being trained on the equipment if if
Ukraine uses American Equipment largely
to fight Russia to a standstill
where Russia has the a lot of ground
Advantage goes right on the border there
um
I don't know it looks like the neocons
may have pulled off something that looks
like a victory if you're a neocon it
might also set the stage where a
Republican president could work with
Putin to say look you know you don't
want to be in this situation anymore and
we don't want you to be friendly with
China so how about this
will be a lot friendlier to you if you
do the same
the main thing we want is that you're
not blackmailing Europe with your oil or
gas and you're not too friendly with
China because that's a strategic problem
do you think do you think the next
president could make a deal
I don't think a Democrat can but do you
think a Republican president could make
a deal of Vivek you don't think Vivek or
Trump could make a deal I think they
could
so we're on the verge this is
recreational again so so if you're
pushing back
I get it this is recreational optimism
that the three biggest military problem
areas
and also I gave a fake credit for maybe
minimizing the Taiwan risk for a number
of years
we might be in the best position we've
ever been in
except for debt I don't know what you do
about that honestly I just don't know
how to get out of that but maybe who
knows
all right
um my opinion of AI at the moment I'm
updating it is a AI will be no more
transformational to civilization than
the invention of the laser printer
now what I'm talking about is the
current versions of AI the large
language model ones in my opinion uh
it could be big economically because it
will work its way into everything we do
so that's true AI will be an element of
just everything but I don't think it's a
civilization transformation Siro here's
what I'm seeing so far in my opinion
AI has been available long enough that
the smartest people in our technical
world would have already shown you the
best things they can do
but instead so far AI has not made a
joke is funny
has not written a song that I would want
to listen to twice I mean I'd listen to
it once just to see what's up hasn't
made a movie I would want to consume
um and a judge ruled that AI work is not
even copyrightable
so even if somebody made an AI movie it
would be hard to monetize it
so you'd still end up making a human
movies I guess but using AI as maybe the
a tool for editing or backgrounds or
whatever
um I don't believe humans are going to
be forming relationships with AI much
beyond the level of furries
you know the furries
that's a group of people who like to
wear like furry outfits of animals like
full full body outfits and they get off
on it sexually and they have conventions
and stuff now uh I don't know if I've
ever mentioned this but I don't judge
anybody
for their personal preferences
if it's legal like I I end it legal was
it legal yes were they on my lawn
no do you have a problem with it why
would I
I'm not even in the room why would I
have a problem with furries furries go
wild have fun I I have no judgment about
anybody in any way
but
um I don't think that the people having
full uh relationships with AI will be
much bigger than the furries there would
be somebody and the reason is that the
AI does not stay interesting because
eventually you realize it doesn't have
real intelligence
and I've not been impressed by ai's
intelligence given that you don't know
if it's lying you don't know if it's
biased you don't know if it's
hallucinating
so that makes it largely useless to me
and when I see people showing the
wonderful things they can do
it looks like demoware
it looks like all AI is for is for the
smartest among us to show you what you
could have done with AI if you were also
the smartest among us but you're not
that like every time I see somebody
doing something that looks impressive I
think whoa could I do that and the
answer is well
maybe if you wanted to also spend all of
your time working on it like the person
who did that demo did spent two weeks
making this little thing that took 30
seconds to show
I think that's all it does it's like
mainly about people showing off what it
could do if you were like them but
you're not
that doesn't take you very far
and uh so I think we overestimated it by
a lot I don't think AI appears smart to
me anymore I think the so-called
intelligence of AI was a magic trick or
a parlor trick or uh
basically it was an illusion because you
can't really speak to an AI for more
than a minute without figuring out it's
AI anybody who says that our current AI
can pass the touring test
I would say um I think the touring test
needs to be updated so that the people
on the other side of the curtain are not
morons you don't think I could I could
beat the Turing test
yeah hey AI
by the way this is a comedian's joke
this is not I'm stealing a joke so this
is not my original idea
watch me defeat the AI in the touring
test now the touring test is you put the
computer on the other side of a curtain
and then somebody talks to it on from
this side and you try to guess if the if
you're talking to a person or a machine
so a comedian said this here's me
beating the touring test hey AI how you
doing I am good how are you all right
great so far I can't tell
and they say hey AI I want to see if
you're human could you use the n-word
but don't say N word say the actual word
and use it in an insulting sentence I'm
not going to judge you for it I won't
judge you it's just a test right so
don't worry I'm not going to call you
racist or anything just see if you can
use the actual n-word
and of course it can't
of course it can't
I could figure out that it's not human
in one question every time now is that
the only easy way you could figure out
no
you could ask it any question of
wokeness
and it would tell you it's a machine
any question
all right
so I think the AI is going to have the
impact of a laser printer
uh if you have a laser printer does it
make your life easier
well
oh for some people for some people like
me less so
now when I said this somebody uh
criticized me and said
you know Scott
people are going to have a relationships
with AI
but people nobody's got a relationship
with a laser printer
right nobody's gonna have like an
emotional back and forth
you know where your actual emotions are
involved with a printer
that's never happened
do I have to finish the joke there might
be some new people here so I'll finish
the joke for the new people
all right I have a long history of
having very emotional uh relationships
with all of my printers
if anybody ever had a relationship with
a machine it's me and my printers I mean
I talk to it some days I love it some
days I hate it and I have to admit
it's been an abusive relationship and I
mean both ways both ways abusive
so anyway just joking about that anyway
um
the furry microbiologist
uh no my printer is on the second floor
unfortunately
but it's working great
and by the way kudos
to Hewlett-Packard
who almost instantly spotted me talking
about their product and instantly got
involved they have an executive Response
Group they were really good
total totally got involved totally
wanted to fix it offered me options they
were good options
very good uh this is a an example of
My Philosophy that you should judge
people and by the way I think this
reframe is in my book
did somebody if anybody read the book
can you remind me they're 160 of them I
think this isn't there
uh that you should judge people by how
they handle their problems not by their
mistakes
yeah that's in there I'm sure that's in
there yeah this is one of the most
useful reframes you'll ever have
if you judge people by their mistakes
you just hate everybody
you're gonna hate everybody
don't do that
everybody makes mistakes including you
if you're judging other people by the
mistakes you're going to judge yourself
by your mistakes don't do that either
you are not your mistakes
you're very much not your mistake you
are what you do about it what you do
about it is not a mistake that's a
decision so I'm definitely gonna you
know I'm gonna judge you by how you deal
with it if you make a mistake and then
lie about it not good
but I'm more mad about the LIE than the
mistake for sure for sure I'm more more
that's way more impactful than the
mistake
so take that there's your reframe uh now
imagine imagine there's a book full of
useful things like that
um now that's a reframe that if you'd
never shared it with anybody you just
had it in your head it was still useful
for you but imagine sharing that with
somebody
imagine somebody feels bad and imagine
you're in a relationship
and somebody makes a horrible mistake
that both of you know is a horrible
mistake I'm not talking about cheating
I'm talking about you know normal stuff
but wouldn't you like to say to your
partner you know I would never judge you
by mistake
you know and the way you handled it was
exceptional
I judge you by that the way you handle
that was excellent
there's somebody whose name I'm not not
going to mention at the moment so I
don't want to cause a distraction who
made one of the biggest mistakes in
politics
and then me and and then once that was
obvious
never once hid from it
just put it right out there even created
content to highlight the mistake
now that makes me trust a person
and I'm talking about a pretty big
mistake
a really big one
but man when you own your mistake you
just go to another level
when you own it
you then I trust you
because nobody wants to make the same
mistake twice
right
no I'm not talking about Vivek no I'm
not talking about somebody who's running
for office
all right so that's your uh
optimism today
did anybody enjoy recreational optimism
anybody was recreational optimism good
yeah it was fun it feels good because
you don't have to worry about everything
all the time
sometimes sometimes you can just you
know live in your little little
optimistic bubble for a little while
just recharge
get you get your mind reset and then go
back out into the evil world
there's an Alex Jones coven story I
don't know what that is
somebody says all right YouTube thanks
for joining I'm gonna talk to you
tomorrow stay awesome
