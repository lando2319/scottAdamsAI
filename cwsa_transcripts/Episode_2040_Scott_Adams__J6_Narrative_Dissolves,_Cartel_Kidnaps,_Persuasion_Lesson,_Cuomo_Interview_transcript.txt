good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
private over there on the locals
platform where we do extra special
things behind the curtain and eventually
on March 13th it'll be the only place
you can see the new dilberts which will
be called Dilbert Reborn
it's at locals if you want to look for
it just look at my uh Twitter profile
for the link or
scottadams.locals.com
it's a subscription site
all right well if you'd like to take
your experience up and I promise you
today will be
not only entertaining you laugh you'll
cry
but probably only because of your own
problems nothing I'm going to say will
make you cry but you'll probably laugh
and you'll probably cry you know your
own stuff but have a good cry if you
like if you need it I mean I'm just
saying if you need it uh and you will
probably be educated in a way that well
it's hard to even describe
or as somebody we know says like
nobody's ever seen before
but first to take your experience up all
you need is a cup of mug or a glass of
tanker cello system the canteen joke a
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
young parallel pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous separate happens now go
ah
so good
well at the uh toward the second half of
this I will talk about my interview last
night with Chris Cuomo which was really
interesting and I'm going to talk about
the communication techniques
and the persuasion techniques that are
that you can see happening what I
attempted to do is move the frame
and then we'll talk about whether I did
that
that'll be later we'll talk about the
news first
um I tweeted just the other day that
having Vivic ramaswamy
uh in the in the primaries makes Trump a
better candidate
would anybody disagree with that at this
point because Trump came out saying he
wants to disband the Department of
Education which Vivek had said just the
other day
now once vivik said it you know I'm sort
of focused on it for a little while uh
Trump kind of had to play catch-up
didn't he you had to catch up
so he had to at least match it
and how happy are you about that
you know I I always tell you that I like
to look at things from a systems
perspective
the goal perspective would be I want
this one candidate to win that would be
a goal a system perspective is we are so
much better off with Vivek in the debate
you're not you know what nobody can say
anymore
Republicans are dumb
or Republicans are too old or yeah
they're they're not they're not reading
the room or like he he just eliminates a
whole bunch of arguments right or or
even that uh conservatives you know
won't back somebody who's a person of
color you know even though he's clearly
not making that a point of anything in
this campaign which is of course
brilliant which is of course why he's
you know gets attention because he's
brilliant
like wouldn't it be nice
to have somebody like in charge of the
country who you legitimately said well I
might not agree with everything but that
guy's brilliant like just once right now
this is the reason that I like Bill
Clinton
yeah I'm far less party-bound than maybe
my reputation would suggest
uh I like Bill Clinton because he was
freaking brilliant and I didn't care who
we banged on the side any more than I
care what Trump did or did not do with
Stormy Daniels
completely irrelevant you know give me
smart
give me capable
I'm good
um so good job for Vivek making things
just better you know no matter what
happens I think he made things better
and looks like that'll continue I would
like to announce a death
um I know that's it's a bummer but
sometimes things die and it should be uh
I think we should take a moment of
silence for it but here's what happened
uh you've probably heard this quote
uh quote it must be true because I saw
the video with my own eyes
well that absurd belief was born around
1951 with the Advent of video and uh it
had a long life but in recent years it
started struggling with a bad illness
and it finally died yesterday February 6
2023 and
R.I.P rest in peace it must be true
because I saw the video with my own eyes
yes that's how all hoaxes are created
making you think there's no other
interpretation than the one you saw in
the video if you learn nothing this year
learn that all video is a lie
all of it
all video is a lie
every time even if it's not edited wrong
it's still focusing your visual
persuasion on one point almost always to
the exclusion of whatever the other
point of view is because if you're
looking at it you're believing it if
you're hearing it you're like ah concept
concept Retreat to my team views I
didn't hear what you said but a video
is is establishing the argument right
all video lies
all video lives all the time it can't do
anything else I don't even know if
there's a possibility for it to not lie
I mean think about it it's always going
to focus you on one thing
at the exclusion or at least the
diminishment of the other things it's
always a lie
at least in you know in part
so yes we're talking about Tucker
Carlson got a hold of the January 6
footage
and his take and most of the people who
are looking at it from the right their
take seems to be that proves the January
6 videos that the so-called select
January 6 committee showed to the world
to build their case
we're a disgusting lie
and
um
although not illegal because I believe
Congress and people
do a fact check on me I believe Congress
is allowed in terms of it being legal
they're they're legally allowed to lie
to you as much as they want are they not
legally
am I right
yeah there's no law against it it's
actually so so we watched Congress
frame a bunch of American citizens
you might call them patriots
and I wouldn't argue with that
we saw our own Congress frame them
because they have this apparently some
kind of loophole
where they can destroy lives by lying in
public in a way that an ordinary citizen
you know couldn't possibly do the same
thing
now like I say it's not illegal
but if it were illegal what would the
penalty be
pretty serious jail time wouldn't it
now I don't think there's any practical
way to make it illegal so I understand
why it's not illegal because everybody's
lying all the time like you couldn't
even have a government if if you went to
jail for lying everybody'd be in jail so
I get why it's not illegal but if it
were illegal
this would have been 25 years in jail
right allowing what dozens or hundreds
how many people how many people went to
jail for effectively trespassing
a lot right if you send dozens or
hundreds of your own citizens to jail
and you know you're lying or at least
you know you're showing things out of
context
it's probably that's that should be like
a 25 years shelter
does anybody disagree with that
it's it's hard for me to think of
anything worse than that that that's you
know not actually murder or rape or
something right pedophilia I suppose
there are a few few things that are
worse but it's one of the worst things
I've ever seen
one of the worst things I've ever seen
unless
unless
does anybody have the suspicion
that you just went from one misleading
set of videos to another
did anybody say themselves
how do I know that Tucker's videos are
giving me the right story
ah
how quickly did you buy into the The
Narrative that the other narrative was
completely wrong
and that it was all a big ol op
pretty quickly right pretty quickly
because that's what agreed with your
preconceived notions didn't it
didn't it yeah you kind of expected
that you'd see that the narrative had
been false
so you saw what you expected
how much should you trust your own let's
say rational census if you see something
that totally agrees with what you
thought was going to be true
you want to be a little bit cautious
here's the here's the thing I'd like to
see
I'd like to see somebody who does not
agree with Tucker Carlson about anything
have access to the whole the whole
catalog give them a little time
and then give them a full a hearing
right this is the sort of thing where
you need to hear the other side so now
Tucker's shown a Counterpoint to the
January six people and I think that was
a huge service would you agree
this I think what Tucker Carlson is
doing somebody somebody said it maybe
cernovich said it that it's uh maybe one
of the most
useful
important things anybody ever did in
journalism it's like right at the top of
important things
in my opinion so so what Tucker's doing
is like real good work
real good work but you as a smart
consumer and I'll bet Tucker wouldn't
disagree with us I'll bet if you were
sitting here he'd say yeah that's true
which is until you hear what other
people say if they also have access to
the full catalog of the videos just see
if they can come up with a narrative
that makes his narrative weaker
I don't know if they can
let me tell you how every hoax was done
that fooled other people all right
here's how those hoaxes were done
here's a video
or a series of videos here's the video
how could you possibly interpret this
any other way
right that's how all the hoaxes are done
I I can't imagine any other way to
interpret this video there's only one
way to interpret this video
as long as they can get you to not
imagine any other way to interpret it
you won't you know you yeah you probably
just won't imagine that there's any
other possibility but I but I would say
imagine there might be
I kind of trust Tucker on this story
so my if I had to guess I don't think
anybody will be able to refute
his narrative in any important way like
there's always ways to pick at the edges
of anything but I don't think anybody's
going to take the heart out of his
narrative
but that's exactly what you say before
you get fooled I can't imagine anybody
doing that
right so I so I'm actually describing
myself in the same blind spot I'm
warning you not to be it it's almost
impossible to avoid it
all right so let's talk about some of
the details so it looks like the uh the
Horn Guy the the Q
Shaman right Q Anon Shaman they call
them
um the videos of him are so clearly
indicating he needs to be released from
prison like right now
like right right now now if somebody
else has other video that shows
something we didn't see maybe but he was
actually hanging out friendly in a
friendly way with a number of uh I don't
know guards or law enforcement what they
were one of them opened a door for him
it seemed like they enjoyed him
I mean they weren't smiling or anything
but it looked like they were either
amused certainly not threatened
certainly not threatened it was just a
guy in a fun outfit walking through a
hallway and they opened a door for him
and they were walking with him at one
point
yeah when you see that video
um again it's impossible to imagine
that what that one person was doing was
in any way a four-year criminal sentence
like I'm not entirely sure what he got
convicted of but wasn't it something
like
protesting or interfering with a
official proceedings or something
yeah and as somebody said I think it was
Tom fitton said on his spaces there can
be things that are technically illegal
that are not appropriate to to prosecute
would you agree that the world is full
of things that are technically illegal
but you do not get a better world by
Prosecuting them
now here's a perfect example of that did
he do things that were technically
illegal probably
is anything he did worth Prosecuting in
the sense that it would make the world a
better place would it would it prevent
him from doing it in the future
I don't think that's a risk
would it prevent anyone else from doing
something similar in the future
if it did I don't think it was worth
putting him in jail
right so you could be technically
you know breaking a law and still the
right thing is not to prosecute they're
probably infinite examples like that
all right uh
so the the general uh tone of the uh
Tucker's narrative I guess is that the
evidence shows uh something like a
patriotic protesters who clearly were
not looking to hurt anybody
everybody agrees there were dangerous
people there who definitely had some bad
ideas all of those people are condemned
if they go to jail I don't care
but that wasn't the character of the
crowd and it wasn't the it wasn't the
point of it it certainly wasn't a
insurrection
so the Insurrection narrative is
dissolving
and Tucker Carlson gets to be right
again
and every time he's right about this
I'll tell you what I'm talking about
every time he's right about this
it pisses me off
because for maybe a few years
I would I would just shake my head when
I heard him say it because it just
sounded so just like team play narrative
stuff and you'd always say that whatever
the Democrats are accusing you of you
can be sure that's what they're doing
themselves
here it is here it is
that they were literally trying to
um
do something just incredibly
uh disrupt disreputable it wasn't
illegal but certainly unethical
certainly on wise certainly bad for the
country right now it wasn't exactly what
what they're accusing people of but it
the accusations did seem like a cover-up
for their own behavior in a way
so I mean I hated when Tucker keeps
being right about that over and over
again
uh poor Josh Hawley
who is there was one video of him
seemingly you know skipping fast or
running or something which uh the
Democrats use to say that guy he
encouraged things and then he ran away
like a coward like a coward now I didn't
see the
um I couldn't see the video when I was
listening to it but apparently that was
debunked when you see the the greater
context
apparently it doesn't look weird or
cowardly if you see the context surprise
surprise a hoax it was a hoax within a
hoax so the you know the first hoax
being that it was an Insurrection
obviously it was a protest not an
Insurrection second host within a hoax
within the hoax was that Holly was
running like a I think that's what
people said
I only use that word because I think
that was actually a congress person to
use that word
um
and then that turned out to be a rupar
at it as we call it where you cut out
the context
have we ever seen this first is this the
first time we've seen a a hoax and then
a hoax within the hoax
have we gone to hoax squared
it's sort of like the Russian egg of
hoaxes oh what's inside here oh lovely
but what's inside here oh another hoax
but wait what's inside here oh
and repeat
all right so
what do you do about all that what do
you do about any of it do you think
anybody will pay
either politically or legally or
lawsuits I don't even think you'd sue
them right I think Congress is exempt
from being sued as far as I know
um
so here's a sort of a side issue uh
again Mike cernovich is going hard at
Trump
for having the opportunity to
preemptively pardon the non-violent
January sixes before he left office and
he didn't do it
which sort of it properly points out
uh
needs some explaining now that's that's
my take my take is it needs some
explaining because again I haven't heard
Trump's argument
can you imagine any argument that Trump
would make that would make you happy
like what what in the world could Trump
say that would make you satisfied having
not pardoned those people before he left
he can't think of one right
you can't even think of one all right
suppose he had one
suppose he had a good suppose he had a
reason that's not obvious
because I don't see any reason
I mean the only reason that's obvious
would be something like cowardice or not
caring those will be the obvious ones
but
what if there's another reason
don't you think there could be some
other explanation that's just not
obvious
let me give you one all right I'm going
to give you an explanation that I'm not
I'm not saying is the accurate one
all I'm doing is stretching your
imagination a little bit right this is
just an imagination stretcher not not a
claim of Truth
imagine being Trump
and you're being accused of running an
insurrection
it looks like Trump had a private Army
do you remember what people were saying
it's Trump's private Army and all the
Maga people basically are
insurrectionists and they don't love the
country they're definitely not Patriots
they're all criminals and they're
running a coup
and then he pardoned some
think about it
just put yourself in Trump's shoes he's
got to make a decision that's good for
himself
but also not damage the country
not damage the country
if you put me in that position and you
say Scott
the ethical thing to do the moral thing
to do is to Pardon those innocent people
right away
would you agree that the ethical and
moral thing to do was depart in those
innocent people before he left office I
would
that that would be the moral and ethical
thing to do
however
would it be good for the country
would it be good for the country
because it would confirm the false
narrative that he had formed a private
Army because if he just says I'm going
to ignore the law I'm going to ignore
the legal process
now keep in mind he also didn't know how
long they would be held or what they
would be charged with exactly right
do you do you think that Trump knew that
today they'd still be in jail for
basically nothing that matters nothing
that matters
no he couldn't have known how bad it
would be but even still I'm going to
agree hard with cernovich
this is a hard agreement
that he didn't put it this way but I
think you would agree with the following
statement that it was unethical
and immoral frankly immoral to not help
them when he knew that they were
just good Patriots
and I would have said the same thing if
I had a bunch of Democrats have been
picked up on sketching charges like in
the in both cases it would be immoral to
leave them there
but number one he could not have known
how bad it would get because he was only
in office what two more weeks
right but he could have suspected that
it would Harden The Narrative the
Republicans are nothing but an
insurrectionist party and the the Maga
movement has to be uprooted by its his
roots
but
playing it this way
again
John if you're coming in late this is
not spinning it this is just helping you
imagine that no matter who it is whether
it's Trump or Satan there might be
something more to the story
every time any of us have been fooled by
a news story and that's all of us I
remember the Covington kids thing fooled
me for a little less than a day but it
definitely fooled me we all have the
same blind spot you can't imagine
what you can't imagine
does that make sense
you you can't understand what you can't
imagine and it could be just there's
more to the story
the the look at the quality of this
comment Scott is a liar
I'm a liar
I've not even made a claim of fact
all I've made is a claim that you should
expand your uh your imagination you're
having a little trouble with this NPC
you can tell the NPCs there is like the
first level I can't get past
anyway so I do not defend uh Trump but
uh just as I try to be consistent with
every story
if you haven't heard the other side
if you haven't heard the other side you
do owe that to Trump
right you owe Trump his explanation
because I think there's a possibility
that he had to choose between destroying
the country and doing something clearly
unethical which is keeping them in jail
or immoral pick your pick your turn
with that choice
I know it might have been the choice
just saying
all right um
how about that lab League Theory
I haven't talked about that too much you
know the fact that now the the consensus
of the experts is it must have come from
the lab
um but it doesn't feel like news to me
like the news is that the government is
is no longer denying you the obvious
explanation
but but doesn't it feel like we've known
it for so long
that the fact that the government had
been lying or was useless in terms of
helping us understand
that feels like business as usual today
doesn't it like the fact that the the
government was lying or misleading once
again once again
I couldn't generate any outrage at all
I've been trying for days to generate
some outrage over the fact that we were
denied you know the obvious explanation
that came from the lab and I'm just it's
now just Baseline government
weaselness that I'm so freaking used to
it it didn't even register in my outrage
orb so I guess I need you know more I
need more to get me outraged I mean it's
an outrageous story I just I'm just so
used to it
here's a logic question
um
let's say there everybody knows there's
some excess deaths that are continuing
long after the pandemic Peak
and there's a lot of question about what
is causing the excess deaths
um
if the covet itself starts fizzling out
or at least the you know the most
dangerous forms of covert fizzle out
let's say the hospitalizations go to
practically nothing it looks like that
could happen in the next I don't know
six months or so
but let's say if the excess deaths
still continued climbing after the covet
itself
had gone away what would be the logical
Theory
somebody say vaccinations vaccinations
now that that was the theory I heard but
I want to test the logic with you
at some point
most adults are going to be vaccinated
most not you necessarily they'll have at
least two two boosters
most
and they will also have been exposed to
covet
so if you've got both the vaccination in
you and the covid
let's say one of those had a long-term
effect let's say both of them stay in
your body forever I'm not saying that's
true but let's say it did let's say the
spike protein stays in your body forever
unless and does bad stuff and let's say
that the covet maybe stays in your body
and does some bad stuff or maybe either
one of them weaken some key system in
your body
so that you don't die right away but
that excess death just stays up there
because people are just generally
weakened from one or the other or from
some you know third or fourth effect
do you think that
the decrease of covid
with the increase of excess deaths
or even the stings or even staying the
same excess deaths do you think that
narrows it down to the vaccinations
because
that would only make sense to me if the
only kind of harm was short-term harm
now most harm is short-term I think but
everything about this virus well not
everything a lot about this virus has
surprised us
so if you've got a surprising and
engineered virus is it possible that it
could be eating at your systems in a
slow way
and then either the vaccination or the
covet
because both of them have some long-term
at least hypothetical risk is it
possible that people could be dying at
greater numbers in the future
only because they had been so degraded
by one or both of those things or three
or four other things
so you can't you get because I think the
math still works
I believe the math Works to keep excess
deaths
um even if covid goes down
I think it does
but I wouldn't bet my life on it because
and by the way the the more likely
explanation
would be exactly exactly the theory that
it's the vaccinations
so
that's just sort of a logic question
whether there's any scenario in which
um
you could not narrow it down but it was
definitely definitely be a strong strong
signal that the vaccinations were a
problem we'll see and apparently we
won't know for sure for maybe until May
all right so I saw this from the ethical
skeptic tweets
um you're in about four Americans
kidnapped by a cartel in Mexico
um that's War
that's War
how many Americans need to be kidnapped
by a cartel in Mexico before its War
one one carful
yeah I think it was four people
somebody says two are dead
oh yeah I figured
no surprise and you were dead
um that's War
yep that's War
you you don't walk away from that that's
War
now do you think uh having Vivek
ramaswamy in the race now makes sense
yes because he said go into Mexico first
try to work with the Mexican Government
but if that doesn't work we take care of
it ourselves
Trump also said that Trump said it first
which I think also raises you know
vivek's bid so now you have two strong
candidates one of them the one who's
leading in the polls saying uh war with
Mexico
like actually invade just the cartels
not the government
yeah
so
uh these deaths should be the turning
point if we're a serious country
it should be the reason to vote uh
Republican
you know all of your other reasons to
not vote Republican don't care
don't care I'm a single issue voter if
we can't fix this one thing
like what's the point of a government
you can't do this one thing just give me
one thing and I'll vote for you
Marcia Blackburn Republican has an idea
on fentanyl she wants to increase
sanctions on China because that's the
source of the precursors I think we all
know that even if China shut down the
precursor business probably just moved
to China or else moved to Mexico or
someplace else some other country so I'm
definitely in favor of this plan but
it's not the end of fentanyl right it
might make a difference it might make a
big difference but it wouldn't be the
m-defense so her idea is to increase the
sanctions on China until they shut down
their business now the way China games
the system is they say we do make it
illegal and if anybody does it we do
pick them up and put them in jail but
the criminals simply change the formula
a little bit of the precursors and then
it doesn't technically trigger the the
law
so as long as the Chinese government
allows them to Tinker with the formula
every time the law is specified it's
like doing nothing
right China knows how to stop it so
that's why I'm in favor of of sanctions
but here's what doesn't work
uh doing the sanctions that you haven't
announced
like oh we're going to give you some
sanctions because you've done this I
don't like that
I like putting it on a schedule
I like
publishing a schedule all right
on this day we're going to do this if
the fentanyl's still coming in which it
will be on this day we're going to do
this additional thing on this day we're
going to do this additional thing and
just show them the menu and you see that
by the end it's full destruction
of their economy
now they can go as far down that list as
they want to
as long as we don't stop going
right at some point they're going to say
you know after three of the things on
this list I don't want to see number six
because this is starting to sting a
little bit right but I think the entire
the entire threat is useless unless it's
completely mapped out on the schedule
this is what we're going to do Tuesday
this is what we're going to do Wednesday
and then you got to do it right no
matter how how brutal it gets
the Matt Hancock story I don't know that
story
the Matt Hancock story
is that ring a belt with anybody
he's British
okay
um
anyway so that's the start
um have you heard about this is like the
worst story in Iran uh for I guess
[Music]
there's all these poisoning attacks in
girls schools over 50 schools and more
than 400 school girls in 21 provinces
across Iran have been poisoned
in school
like intentionally I guess it's obvious
that it's intentional but they don't
know who's doing it they assume you're
the best guess is some religious
extremist who doesn't like girls
education which is pretty good guess
but
I can't even imagine that
can you
it's like it defies imagination it's
like a level of evil that your brain
can't
I can't even rap inside around
so you know this is this is one thing
where I guess I can say I agree with the
Ayatollah the Ayatollah says if they
find who's doing it they're gonna
they're gonna execute them and
I hate to agree with Ayatollah
but yeah
that would be a big guess you need to
execute whoever that is wow
um president XI was getting a little
more appointed about the America no
surprise and he's he's saying directly
in his speeches that the U.S is hurting
China's economy
and I don't know how much is the U.S
hurting it with sanctions
and how much is just the natural
situation but here's some of the bad
economic news for China no surprise
China's exports fell seven percent yeah
in the January to February period
I don't know if that's a big deal could
be seasonal I don't know what that's
about uh extending a decline from
private previous months okay that's even
worse as Global demand weakened and
imports dropped 10 percent
uh China's exports the U.S plunged 15
percent
[Applause]
there we go
good work America
yeah China's exports the U.S plunged 15
now here's something that you wouldn't
necessarily know if you're not an
economist or you don't study this stuff
you don't have to take a hundred percent
of anything to destroy it
right the things have a Breaking Point
and you know you don't have to get down
to zero zero exports to America before
China's in serious trouble
15 sounds like a catastrophe to me
doesn't it to you
a 15 decline in the in exports the U.S
to me that sounds like a catastrophe
like it's not it's not a end of the
economy a catastrophe but what if it's
25 or 30 percent
you know if it's 30 percent
it's probably game over
and we're heading in that direction
now you know that's always hyperbole too
have I ever used any hyperbole before
is this the first time I think maybe
I've possibly done that before I have
like some vague memory where I've done
that before but no it doesn't mean the
child is going to collapse but it would
be it would be a serious adjustment
they'd have to make if they lost if if a
U.S exports declined 30 percent
15 is pretty big
all right who would like to hear about
my interview last night with Chris Cuomo
on news Nation only available uh
initially on your cable If They carried
it but now it's available on YouTube
so if you go to my pinned tweet
on YouTube today you'll get a link to
the full interview
and I wanted to talk about it but also
give you a little bit of a
sort of a lesson
would anybody like a Media communication
persuasion lesson
because it's coming up
all right
but first let's go to the Whiteboard
here here's my overview of what life is
like for me in the in the center of a
scandal
there appear to be two very two very
different worlds
there's a real world
like the one when I walk outside
and
everybody I see is kind and happy
and they have genuinely genuine good
feelings for other people
I don't know what your experience is in
life but I don't really run into any
ugly people in terms of attitude not
looks but almost everybody I encounter
in real life
is happy to talk to you if you're happy
to talk to them
they can easily like you very easily you
just have to be a nice person
uh the only problem with the real world
is you've got a few Cairns am I right
I'm using that sort of generically for
you know you always have some bad
characters and criminals and whatnot but
basically the the 99
experience of life if you don't count
that co-worker who's a psychopath
everybody has a co-worker who's a
psychopath right but you know not
counting that most of your interactions
are just with cool people having a good
time and it works across race age gender
uh religion sexual orientation yeah you
name it that's the real world
but we've we've been hypnotized into
thinking the screen world I call it the
screen world the thing that's only
happening on my screens
so I I'm in the middle of one of the
biggest
scandals dramas cancellation whatever
you call it and the in the entire
history of America
it's one of the big ones I don't know
what would be the biggest but I think
you'd agree my cancellation is one of
the biggest
I I have no real world feeling about it
like the the penalty went from the
screen world over to the real world and
I you know got canceled it so it affects
my economics
you know by incomes down 80 percent
if your income now goes down to 80 you
definitely feel it yeah no matter who
you are you definitely feel it
um but the screen world isn't any real
people
you know there are real people who
interact but everybody turns into their
worst self
in person people like to put on their
their best self why wouldn't you but on
the screen everybody turns into like a
monster
so you got mostly trolls uh boss
grifters narcissists white Knights click
oars peacocks the angry uninformed
they're my favorite we love the angry
uninformed uh and then political hacks
who are just working for collects of
attention or money
none of this is real
I didn't even get canceled in the real
world it's just that the cancellation
bled into a different world
like usually it doesn't jump yeah
usually you can keep the screen world in
the screen world but but it broke out of
its like uh it was like a portal from
Hell opened it was like
and and once once the portal from Hell
connected these two worlds
all hell broke loose all right I gotta
draw that
this has to be immortalized
if I can reach without pulling my
microphones off
yeah
this will be the
portal from hell
portal
from hell
right so that that's sort of the big
picture
portal from Hell take a good look at
that it's beautiful
I think you can tell from this that I'm
a professional cartoonist like I don't I
don't like to brag and stuff but I mean
look at this it's beautiful
can you tell that Karen looks like
exactly like a human female yeah yes you
can or possibly uh a stain on a napkin
it's one of those two things
I do them both very well
all right let's talk about uh here's the
big picture uh so last night I did one
hour for Chris Cuomo uh and boy do I
appreciate Chris Cuomo all right so I
think I told you before he was he was
one of the people who contacted me but a
lot of people contacted me for
interviews and comments I said no to
almost all of them
but when he contacted me it was clear he
had he had done his homework so he
actually understood the full context
amazing uh secondly he promised to give
me you know close to a full hour so that
I wouldn't be timed out before I made my
point
thank you that's exactly what this
required
so I said yes
and he delivered he totally delivered
now news Nation I was not totally
familiar with but I think they're trying
to I believe they're trying to frame
themselves as the
non-crazy news you know without the
super spin there's always a little bit
of bias in everything but I think
they're trying to find the middle
and I think they did I think they
actually found the middle of this story
so he asked he asked hard questions I'll
talk in more detail and I'll give you
some media lessons so he asked hard
questions
and by the way you can see the link to
the full thing in my pinned tweet on
Twitter
uh he pushed on the hard questions which
is what I wanted him to do because I
don't want to do interview with a
friendly like somebody who just agrees
with me
that that's not really going to move
anything talking to people who agree
with me
not really a good use of time
so uh I knew that he would push but I
also knew that he knew the full context
and I knew that he'd give me time to say
what I wanted to say and he delivered
all three
so
you know revise your CNN opinions of
Chris Cuomo because that was a solid
contribution to journalism I think
now
my uh my objective was to reframe things
and move the window
so those of you watched it can either
confirm or deny but those of you who
have not watched it and plan to if
you're interested to see these little uh
let's say communication techniques that
I'm going to talk about if you want to
see them in practice just watch the
video after I explain them
all right so the first thing that this
is like a media lesson to the first
thing you want to avoid if you find
yourself in the Scandal is going on a
show with a four minute hit
because they're just gonna yell at you
for three and a half minutes
you'll get half a minute to do something
that takes 10 minutes and then you'll
run out of time
so that's basically just you know uh
inviting you into a trap but if somebody
says I'll give you an hour and it'll be
live and the live part's very important
right that's what Chris Cuomo offered
was live you don't want it recorded
that's the 60 Minutes trick
right the 60 Minutes trick is to say oh
it's a it's a high respectable thing you
sure want to be on here and then they
can cut the video any way they want
you've seen a lot of people complain
about that right so the First Media
trick is don't go to anything that's
short
don't go to anything that's recorded
you get that right and you get a chance
right and then also this is important
you want to pick somebody that the
audience will think is going to go at
you hard
that's important if it's looks too
friendly then you lose all credibility
you want somebody who genuinely is going
to challenge you on whatever allegedly
you did wrong and and Cuomo did that
all right so here's what I want to do
number one I wanted to put my point of
view on record without the without any
of those limitations I just uh detailed
did I do that
did I accomplish
putting on video one full record of my
complete thinking
yes yes I was happy with the time you
gave me the questions he asked and he
gave me all the Time in the World to to
fill in a lot of context which made a
difference
um so I got my viewpoint on record
did you see anybody disagree with my
major reframes which were the point of
the entire offense right the as I
described I intentionally used hyperbole
to draw energy
toward me to make a point and to reframe
the race conversation
so my objective was just to put out the
idea into the universe that a lot of the
race related training from CRT to esge
to Dei they're all backwards
philosophies or backwards strategies
nobody in life goes forward by looking
backwards you can have small gains like
you can make somebody guilty and they'll
give you some money in the short run but
in the long term no person no individual
black white any other color no company
no organization can Thrive unless it's
focused forward
if you take a driver a driving lesson
they will teach you to make sure you
check your mirrors
always be aware of History don't forget
your history make sure you're really
clear on you know everything that
happened in black history Etc
but your focus has to be on the road am
I right I'm not ignoring my rear view
mirrors that would be bad driving I I'm
looking at my history I'm looking at
what's behind me but my focus is
straightforward now that was what that
was the main thing I wanted to get
across and that there is that there are
a set of tools
that can make any individual successful
as long as we work together to fix
schools which are completely broken at
the moment schools are broken for black
kids white kids they're just just broken
completely
and so that's the common ground
if you look forward you can say to
yourself hey
how can we work together to fix this
thing If You Look Backwards you just
argue about who owes who
I mean it just can't work
take my take my exact situation
what I offered was a set of success
tools because a lot of the audience
didn't know that I had more impact in
the field of personal success that's
what I write about and teach online Etc
so I have way more impact on the world
on that domain the audience was not
aware of that but here I am offering a
set of tools to make anybody more
successful
and would be especially useful to
anybody who's suffering from systemic
racism
because systemic racism is a real drag
on success
but if you learn the right tools of
success you can slice through it like a
hot steel through butter
is still a barrier
but if you have a hot rod to stick
through it that was not a sexual
reference it just sounded like it don't
stick your hot rod through butter
you can I just don't recommend it
um
so look at my exact situation
people are mad at me for what I said
in the future
are they mad at me for something I said
in the future no that's not possible are
they mad at first at me for something
I'm saying right now like in the present
nope nope they're mad at me for the past
now look what look what you miss if
that's your focus
if your focus is mad at me from the past
does that ignore the fact that I'm the
most persuasive person in the realm of
personal success and I've just told you
how to be personally successful in a way
that
is very likely to work for just about
everybody
I'm offering for free you don't have to
buy my book I'll tell you everything you
want for free
right now somebody's going to buy the
book because it's it's packaged in a way
but that's not the point in fact if you
tried to buy my book you couldn't
you couldn't buy my books and try
they're all banned at the moment so I
think they're out of stock yeah no so
it's not about selling the books I'd
love I'd love to sell some books I
usually do things for more than one
reason so if somebody bought my books
that'd be great but I will give it all
to you for free and I do it all the time
I how many times do I describe what's in
the book for free on live stream so if
you look at me as somebody who said
something you didn't like in the past
you would be blind to the fact that I
just opened up
you know this Trove of useful things
that I want to give you for free that
absolutely will change your life in a
positive way
now if that sounds absurd to anybody
who's new to me I'm going to do an
exercise that I often do
can I deliver that
the people who know me you've been
around can I deliver I'm giving you
tools that would make you more
successful based on your own experience
can I deliver
locals all say yes because they've
watched me the longest
YouTube the people who know me say yes
right this is a real asset
right as all you have to do is remove
your past blindness
stop looking at the rear view mirror and
look at me I'm standing in the road
right in front of your car with a big
barrel of cash
who sought
in in this entire drama
who was able to see me standing in the
front of the highway with a big barrel
of cash and it was for free it's free
cash
right now that was the frame that I was
trying to reframe I was trying to
reframe from looking at the past
to frame it as looking at the future
always works
if you have the right tools but also you
need to fix the systemic racism in the
schools because if you don't get schools
right nothing else Works basically I
mean it works it's pretty hard
all right so I believe I put into the
world the idea that you should stop uh
pursuing anything that's a backwards
looking strategy for success
now that's called The High Ground
maneuver which I've discussed as the
most powerful
persuasion technique
literally no one can disagree with
looking forward instead of backwards
because if you said it out loud you
would sound stupid
you would sound stupid if you said you
know I hear what you're saying Scott but
I really do like focusing on the past
nobody could even say that in public
because it sounds so stupid right and
yet everybody was doing it
not just black people everybody was
doing it everybody was focusing on the
past
and when you deal with me you're
focusing on the past too if all you can
 about is something I said in the
past recent past recent past
still passed
the recent past is still the past
yeah it's different
all right so
um that should act like an ear worm you
know how earworms are you hear music and
you can't get out of your head
the people who heard you should not
focus on the past
are going to have a hard time forgetting
that would you agree
it's a reframe that and this is how
reframes work one of the magic of
reframes is that a good one you only
have to hear once
such as alcohol as poison
just thinking of alcohol as poison is it
reframe that actually makes it easier to
stop drinking has been proven many times
so yeah a good reframe gets in your mind
and it can't get out and especially if
it's a high ground maneuver
zero people now you saw at the end of
the if you watch the Cuomo interview he
brought in a few guests to get a
Counterpoint which I thought was good
technique now you could argue that I
should have also been on to Counterpoint
the Counterpoint but at some point you
know at some point it becomes too much
so I was I was happy with that even even
not having a response to the responses
that was fair because you know it's the
real world
but did you see any of the people say
that you should have a backwards Focus
did anybody disagree with my primary
purpose and reframe I don't think so
right
so
here um here are the things that uh
that I think were not uh focused on
did and you saw I didn't see the guest
talk I only heard some quotes so you'll
have to fact check me on this did the
guests see it on later I guess was Dan
Abrams and
uh some of the Eric Dyson
and then another gentleman whose name I
can't remember anyway did any of them
accuse me of being a right-wing uh Maga
or a racist
did that did anyone say that no no
because once you heard the context that
no longer made sense
so was I successful at least in the
interview not in the world but in the
interview was I successful in reframing
myself as not a right wing crazy
yes or no
yes right so that that would be a big
success communication wise wouldn't it
because that would be an objective
um
remember how in the first days of my
Scandal everybody was focused on the
quality and usefulness of the pole the
Rasmussen Pole
by the end of me giving the context
was anybody still complaining about
depending on the poll knowing that I
didn't depend on the poll
I don't think they talked about it did
they
so that would be a successful
communication
um
how about their focus on you had to know
that there would be trouble yeah
everybody's been saying the same thing
you had to know you had to know and then
you suffered the consequence
did you see that I agreed with that and
have from the beginning you had to know
yeah of course I knew it was a risk it
was a calculated risk but why did you do
it if you had to know well I was using
hyperbole but you had to know yes I had
to know that's why I did it
I knew that it would cause trouble
that's the reason I did it but you had
to know it would cause trouble
okay how many times do I have to say I
knew it would cause trouble
before you'll agree with me I knew it
would cause trouble that's why I did it
okay I hear you but
you had to know it caused trouble
yeah I don't know if you noticed that a
lot of the conversations are starting to
take that form
but
um yeah did you notice that
right
so
but then there was uh why am I
complaining remember people kept saying
why are you complaining because you knew
there was you know the risk
and I say when did I complain
I've described
but I've never complained once
I I think they accepted that because
they have no I mean there's no
counterfactual nobody seemed to complain
I haven't complained privately
believe it or not I mean you there's no
way to know that but even privately I
have not complained
because I'm not I'm not processing it as
a complaint
do you know why I don't process it as a
complaint
guess why
why do I not process what I'm doing as a
well why don't I feel like I should
complain do you know why
because I'm not looking at the past
I'm looking at the future and you know
what the future kicked up
the future just kicked up me as the most
prominent voice on an important trend
and
put me exactly where I wanted to be
if you would ask me in advance Scott
this is going to cost you
uh here's the number
it's going to cost you this many dollars
but you get to be exactly where you are
now would you take the deal
yep
yeah I would
I would
now I know that doesn't make sense to a
normal person
and I've never claimed I'm normal so I
get that you wouldn't make the choice I
get that
but I'm pretty comfortable with it
pretty comfortable
all right what else um
I made the claim and Chris allowed me to
interrupt him
um
to make this point because for a moment
it looked like we were going to go to
break or something before I made an
important point I claim that everyone
who understood the context agreed with
me
uh but for a minute it looked like maybe
that point was getting lost and there
was some um let's say disagreement that
quote everybody agreed with me and then
I got a chance this is why you won an
hour right this is exactly why
offering me an hour is exactly the right
thing to do
uh so I interrupted him because I had
time right if I didn't have time I
couldn't have done it but I had time to
interrupt and say no I just want to
clarify it's only the people who've seen
the context who are okay with it
and I got I got to like really focus on
that
um in the end uh I think Chris Cuomo
disagreed with me being canceled
um I couldn't hear at that point but I
think that happened right
if you saw it
would you would you call that a
let's say a communication goal achieved
because if if the host actually says you
shouldn't be
canceled after hearing the whole context
and really listening to it
that's it that's about as good as it
gets right now I never wanted him to to
agree
with the the way I said it I never asked
them to agree with the hyperbole because
the whole point of the hyperbole is that
it makes you mad
now if you saw it there was a point
where he asked a really good question
and I think it was based on a caller's
uh concern
um you know what do you say to the
caller who was hurt
like her feelings were hurt by you know
my my statements
and
under many normal circumstances that
would be a normal apology situation but
I would I think I would hold an apology
for this world
anybody in this world the real one who
wants an apology I'd probably give it to
him
I'd probably give it to him and I
wouldn't even I don't think I'd hesitate
if somebody was standing in front of me
and said
you know hey you made me feel bad I'd
probably say something like this well
I'm sorry it made you feel bad but I had
a I had a purpose in mind and all change
is painful
I hope you can get over it and hey how
about let's not focus on the past I've
got some really good tools for you that
would make you more successful are you
interested
so
um
let's see what else so when the uh
oh let me say that there I did have a
blind spot which I think explains a lot
uh here's my blind spot which I think
fills in the biggest mystery because
when people said you had to know it
would happen
that sounds uh that sounds incomplete
because I uh
you know I say I was surprised that it
was that big
and people say how can you possibly be
surprised that the reaction was that big
and
that's a
wouldn't you like to know that why was I
surprised that the reaction was that big
doesn't that seem like a blind spot
because I was surprised I was genuinely
surprised I knew there'd be a reaction
that was a point
all right here's why
it is impossible
to sit here and talk to
um
two computer screens
and feel my impact on the world
you can't feel it is there's a total
illusion when you're famous that you're
not famous
did you know that
I speculate that what one of the reasons
that somebody like uh Michael Jordan
talks about himself with a third party
like Michael Jordan would never do that
or Michael Jordan isn't going to let you
lose the game in the last second like
like he's a different person
it's because you're you know public
person and you're a real person or
completely different
um so did I underestimate my own let's
say
uh
I won't say importance did I
underestimate
my impact on other people's minds
and I think I did or influence maybe
yeah reach reach maybe so I
underestimated my reach and my influence
now the reach of course was accelerated
by the fact that as I talked about on
the show and I didn't see anybody
disagree that we've monetized outrage
so I definitely underestimated the
effectiveness of the monetization of
outrage because I didn't think they
would get to my choke points right I did
think some newspapers might bail out
that was a risk but I didn't think
they'd get to my actual distributor
if you can turn the distributor off then
all the newspapers turn off at the same
time which is what happened and the same
with my books yeah it's not like they
have to cancel a book they went after
the publisher and the publisher had my
entire backlog of books plus the new one
so with one cancellation they can get my
whole catalog of books so that that's
what happened now I didn't that was not
something I saw coming
so if you want to call me Dom or say I
have a blind spot because I didn't
realize that people cared enough about
my opinion I mean honestly I didn't
think people cared enough about my
opinion I really didn't that was sort of
a surprise but I'm not sure they cared
about the opinion so much as the outrage
machine is so well oiled and everybody
gets a Payday uh click click click click
click click everybody gets a Payday so I
think I had not estimated how
efficiently the cancellation machine is
in February 2023. so that's on me
would you agree
that's on me
so because one of the things that people
want to say is you're not taking
responsibility no I'm trying to take it
as hard as possible
I'm trying I'm trying to take as much
responsibility as I could possibly can
if there's anything I'm leaving out
remind me and I'll take that
responsibility too I'm a hundred percent
responsibility
for what I did
now I'm not responsible for the fact
that we have a backwards looking world
and you know there's a cancellation
Machinery that operates efficiently
that's for other people to work on
but I'm completely responsible for any
risk management decision I make if it
goes wrong
and then other people just don't know
how to do uh statistics
uh well let me get to this point so one
of the guests uh who came on they did a
little mind reading so one of the guests
had two complaints which he emphasized
on Twitter today uh he he's surprised
that I was baffled by the outcome that
was his words
I was baffled by the cancellation
have does that word fit anything that
happened
because what I thought happened was it
was a calculated risk and one of the one
of the outcomes was complete
cancellation of course it was it wasn't
my expectation
but of course it was an obvious risk and
and he read my mind and after all this
decided that I was baffled that I got
canceled
now baffled is one of those words you
use when you don't have an argument
if you don't have an argument you read
somebody's mind and then you
characterize it in a weird way and then
you criticize your own characterization
of the thing you mind read
that's called winning the conversation
for me if I could give somebody's only
best argument to be that they imagined I
was baffled
when the evidence suggests exactly the
opposite
but the way I did have I did have a
blind spot that's true but I wasn't
baffled that you know that was always a
possibility
then this other was uh
he says he disagrees that I said it was
the quote only way to fight racism
did I say anything like that
did anybody hear me say that getting
canceled was the only way to fight
racism
nothing like that
so when somebody has to literally make
up an opinion for you assign it to you
and then argue you shouldn't have that
opinion
who won the conversation
that that's me winning as hard as you
can win that's like
game over
all right
Dan Abrams argued and uh keep in mind
that he was an attorney right
so he's somebody who's really good at
arguing and breaking down logic and
stuff all right so the guy who's a
professional
logical communicator
had this to say he said I can't have it
both way both ways claiming that I was
using hyperbole but I was also taken out
of context
so he lawyered me and he said ah I found
a technical problem with the argument
you can't use hyperbole or say you used
hyperbole but also a completely
different excuse that you were taken out
of context
to which I say
the hyperbole was the specific sentence
the context is why I said it
yes Dan Abrams you can use Hyperbole and
be taken out of context there's
absolutely no conflict between those two
things they work together really well
yes hyperbole yes also take it out of
context
and that was his best I think that was
his best criticism
keep in mind that none of the points I
made were involved in the criticism
right the criticism is that you can't
have it both ways
when obviously you can
quite easily and it doesn't take much to
convince you it's true
that was the best he had
he's a lawyer
he's a smart guy he does this for a
living
well he does this for a living and that
was his best take
that that's all he had
can I win any harder than that
seriously would it be even possible to
win harder than that I don't think so
um and then there were some Professor
guy
who somebody said that he was doubting
that a qualified black applicant would
have an advantage in a big Corporation
in America that is desperate to increase
their diversity
did that actually happen
did he actually doubt the fact
that a qualified black employee would
have an advantage in Corporate America
I didn't know that anybody questioned
that
but if there are other people in Black
America who believe that's true think of
the opportunity they just opened up
imagine imagine if that's a common
opinion
and imagine some number of black
Americans watched the show
because there were a number of Collins
so I know he's got black Watchers
viewers
so imagine you're a black American and
you heard me say no if you get a good
education you're going to actually be at
the top of the hiring list imagine you'd
never heard that before
because I've actually heard other other
black Americans say that they said no
that's not true there's no favoritism in
Corporate America and and I have to
explain the long story of
it is so true it's like the truest thing
that's ever been true like there's no
gray area this is the truest of all true
things it just doesn't apply to small
companies
so I think that's where the confusion is
if your experiences with small companies
yeah they're probably pretty racist so
that would be a good strategy to not get
a job at the Korean supermarket right
have I ever advised a young black man to
get an education and you know while he's
working through school go work at the
Korean grocery store
I don't know if they're going to
discriminate
but I'd worry about it yeah go where go
where you have a a an advantage
in bias
because the world is going to give you

great strategy for black Americans but a
good way to do it is to get some
corporate experience and connections and
build up some money and stuff and then
start a business that's not a bad way to
do it so two ways to do it
