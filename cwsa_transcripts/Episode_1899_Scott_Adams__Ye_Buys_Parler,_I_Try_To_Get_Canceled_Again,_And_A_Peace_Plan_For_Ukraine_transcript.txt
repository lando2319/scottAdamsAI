foreign
good morning everybody
welcome to coffee with Scott Adams the
finest experience anybody's ever had yes
today
yes today
will be another Peak experience and all
you need to take it to its maximum
potential is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker chalister Steiner canteen sugar
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
thing to make say everything better
it's called simultaneous if it happens
now go
um
savor it
save red
that's good
well let's start with the fake news of
the day
fake news of the day fake news of the
day
uh did you see the story that Mark
Wahlberg is moving out of California
so he's going to move out of LA and move
to he hopes Nevada
now how did the news cover that story
did it cover it like he wants to get out
of California because California is a a
hell hole
sort of that's how they covered it
because that's the narrative right the
narrative is people moving out of
California because California is a hell
hole do you know why Mark Wahlberg is
moving out of California
well I don't know either but I did watch
a special of his just recently in which
he said it had something to do with tax
benefits for building a facility
yeah there was some kind of uh I looked
like he was negotiating with somebody in
Nevada
that he would build some kind of a
facility
maybe a studio like a like a new studio
or something but
he's waiting for tax breaks to do it
so really it's pretty much just a
business decision
I finally figured something out
that I've been wondering about for a
long time have you noticed how often
people will become famous in one thing
and then they just can't leave it alone
they they try to be successful in a in a
different Realm
and
and people get real upset about it
why is it why
why do people who make it in one Realm
try to succeed in a different realm
because you've seen me try to do it as
well why do we do that
why do people try to do that why would
you leave your lane
I'll tell you I'll tell you in my
situation
I had to find out what my limits were
I didn't know if I had limits because
when Dilbert started working out
everything worked like I wrote a book it
was a number one bestseller you know
just everything was working uh you know
I won the the cartoonist you know top
award for cartooning so for a while
there
everything I did not only worked but it
worked great
and I wondered
um now you say hubris and you're
completely wrong
right so your point would be the
opposite of my point so your point is
the traditional point that the people
succeed at one thing and then they give
full of themselves and say oh I'll bet I
can succeed at everything I'm not saying
that
very different
I'm saying that I actually didn't know
what my limits were so I had to find out
imagine if you thought you had a
superpower
but you didn't know how much of a
superpower isn't that the first thing
you'd have to find out
you'd have to find out like what else
can I do
I don't know I don't know what else I
could do the only way you could find out
is to try it
so I'll tell you what I learned
I learned that I'm a terrible business
owner
well just terrible just awful
and there's you know I'm very good at
um being an entrepreneur for myself
so if if I'm completely in charge of you
know the thing that makes money then I'm
fine
but I can't manage people
can't do it and I think the reason is
I can't buy into the level of evil that
it takes to do it you know because
managing people usually means getting
them to do something very unpleasant for
them
so that you will have a payoff
no I just can't get there I don't know
how to I don't know how to abuse other
people from my benefit
so I can never be a good business owner
because you have to manage people anyway
um then secondly why is it that people
this is my other
realization why is it that people get
mad
when people leave their Lane
such as Elon Musk talking about Ukraine
why do people get mad when people do it
I I have a theory here
jealousy is not quite right not envy and
not jealousy
but you're you're in the right ballpark
all right here's my spin on it
most of the people who complain about
somebody leaving their Lane have a
certain quality about themselves what is
it
it's not everybody who complains does
everybody complain when Elon Musk tries
to do something outside of his expertise
no not everybody now it's not a liberal
it has nothing to do with liberal
Republican nothing so it's not political
at least that's not where I'm going
some of it's political but that's not
where I'm going
it's not a lack of confidence
here's what it is
if you were a uh if you were a person
who believes you are capable
let's say you did well in school you
went to college you got a good degree
you look good you wear a suit you got
your hair you know whatever whatever you
think makes you you know look like you
should succeed
and you're not succeeding as much as you
thought you should
I think it's how people explain
it's how they explain why they're not
more successful
bear with me if everybody who succeeded
is succeeded in exactly one field and
could never leave their field
what would you be able to say about
yourself if you had done everything
right but you had not really succeeded
what would you say about yourself
you would say you didn't get lucky
you would say the other person got lucky
and you know it's luck because the
moment they tried to extend their skill
into another field it doesn't work
so if people can't leave their field you
can tell yourself they got lucky
because obviously if it's not luck you
could take that skill somewhere else and
succeed again right so it's just luck
and if you can explain your own own
existence as being just bad luck
well then your ego is intact
so I don't think it's jealousy I think
it's ego
I think it's how people people
understand themselves
so when people are criticizing people
for leaving their field
they're really saying I don't want you
to succeed in the second field
because if you do I've got some
explaining to do about why I haven't
succeeded in any
I think that's what it is
honestly I saw you
a European who is giving
um some criticism to David sacks
who on Twitter has been trying to be
helpful and suggest ways forward for the
Ukrainian war and to come up with some
peace plans so David Sachs who you
should know is a famous Tech investor
kind of person if you don't know his
name
you should
he's one of the names you should know if
you want to have an awareness of how
things work
right if you want to understand the
world
he would be in the list of 100 names you
should know
and here's what's interesting
we're watching people like David sacks
and uh
um Elon Musk and uh so who was the other
VC uh care member's name but some other
fairly well-known famous people talking
about what they would do or some
suggestions for ending the war in
Ukraine
all right and I saw a European mock
specifically uh Dave sacks uh I saw a
European say it was sort of an American
thing
that citizens would believe that they
could just wade into
like a nuclear confrontation and be
useful
now what do you think of that
some European guy I think he was
European but it was non-american
Sega is an American thing to imagine
that just an ordinary person can go like
change the world
and I think to myself well that's why
your country isn't doing so well
I don't even know what country he was
from but I can tell you they're not
doing so well
because
that's what we do over here
now I heard somebody else say that we're
sort of a problem-solving country
we're not just a problem-solving country
that's part of it and I believe that's a
huge part
we're in the most problem-solving
 who ever lived that that
is America we are problem solving
 we will solve a problem
like nobody's business we know how to
dissolve some problems
but we also have this characteristic
where we feel Unlimited
yeah not everybody not all the time but
there are enough of us
Americans who feel like we actually can
change the world
and so we try
and every once in a while it works
and that's what you get that's how you
get Apple Computers right
that that's how you get you know
starlink and Tesla and SpaceX
because we don't feel like we're limited
if if we think we have a something to
add we jump in
if your car is on fire we stop and pull
you out
we solve problems so
when I see people making fun of you know
David sacks for making a citizen
suggestion
I say I don't think you understand
what's happening right now
I would put David Sachs in the uh
internet dad category I don't know if
he'd want to be in that category but and
what I mean is people who have built
credibility in some Realm
and they're trying to use it
productively
to make the world a better place
because I honestly think that's
primarily what Elon musking is trying to
do
like long ago he made enough money I
think he's trying to fix the world and
when I watch you know David Sachs tweets
I don't see anything else
I don't see him trying to make money out
of Ukraine nothing he's just trying to
fix a problem
and so am I
so am I I mean I have a you know a
business model which allows me to
benefit the larger my audience is but
that's pretty standard stuff
I mean I wouldn't be doing it just for
the money it's not what I would do I
would do it because I think I maybe
maybe I could add something
so here's what I'm going to add this the
Ukraine war I don't think our
politicians can solve this one
it has that weird characteristic that
the politicians aren't going to be able
to get this done
so if we need to get to some kind of a
good end point
it's going to be the Internet ads
it's going to be the internet dads
so let me tell you what one of them says
and I'm not I'm not going to promote
this particular idea right because I
don't want Ukraine to be mad at me yet
they will be but not yet
yeah there is a day when Ukraine will be
mad at me but not yet so I'm just going
to say uh what David sacks ideas
for ending the war
um
so
um
he says uh concrete suggestion uh U.S
proposes an Armistice Armistice based on
February 23rd lines along with a
guarantee that Ukraine won't become part
of NATO
now
what are the February 23 third lines
does that mean uh
that Russia would give back everything
but Crimea
is that where February is that what that
is
that that's what that is right so the
suggestion again this is not mine so
Ukraine you can't be mad at me I'm just
talking
so the idea would be that you uh Russia
would keep
Crimea
which some would say is you know settled
a settled issue
but give back the disputed areas
and then Ukraine doesn't join NATO
now if you were an observer
who would you say won in that case who
would be the winner if that were the
peace plan
would you say that Russia won because it
keeps Ukraine and of NATO
and they keep Crimea but they were going
to keep that anyway probably
would you say that that would be a case
of Russia winning
or would you say that would be a bull
the the both of them had a little pain
which is sort of what you want for a
lasting peace you know a little bit of
pain
why are you so focused on Ukraine
uh could it be the 10 to 25 chance of
nuclear war
is that was that a serious question you
wonder why I'm focused on the Ukraine
like our entire civilization depends on
this
everything
so yeah I'm gonna
I'm gonna focus on that
so what do you think of that idea
well it doesn't matter what you think
about it does it
because you're Americans and you're not
you're not in it
so here's the uh but the rest of it gets
into more uh what happens if you don't
so here's the rest of uh Saks suggestion
if Moscow rejects that idea
because obviously that would be them
giving up some land that they control
right now if Moscow rejects War goes on
until the February 23rd line is reached
so there's an assumption here that
um Ukraine would eventually be able to
take back those disputed territories
anyway but maybe not Crimea
and then uh
he goes on even if Moscow rejects The
Proposal now keeping it on the table
creates an alternative to nuclear use if
they become desperate thereby reducing
the risk of nuclear war
now
do you see
that David sacks
a citizen
the citizen of America
that's all
not an elected person
he just protected you
from nuclear war
he just did that
like actually literally with a tweet he
protected you from nuclear war now not
completely not completely but he is high
enough visibility
high enough visibility that if enough
people retweet that and I retweeted it
some other people did if enough people
retweet it Russia will see
that there are some let's say prominent
voices
who have a plan that Putin might be able
to live with
this less than nuclear war
and that escape valve the fact that
there might be an escape valve that
prominent Americans would support
does give Putin a little bit of a back
door if he needs it it does take the
risk of nuclear Holocaust
down
now
why did he have to do that
why did David sacks have to reduce the
risk of nuclear war himself why do you
have to do it personally
because nobody else was
nobody else did
where is Biden's plan that would give
Putin an exit you know to escape from
nuclear war where's that
it's like the the reason that the
internet dads get involved
is because something needed to be done
it wasn't getting done
and here here David Sykes just protected
you from nuclear war
with a tweet
literally now I'm not saying you know he
reduced the odds of War I mean he didn't
reduce the the odds to zero
I'm saying it makes a difference now if
he if he if that message got extended
then Ukraine would hate it and they'd be
arguing about how terrible it is but it
would be an alternative
it it only has to exist
as a functional alternative that people
are talking about and he did that for
you he did that for you
so to whoever it was who was saying you
know this is about Americans that
Americans think that you know if you're
just a citizen you can just jump in and
you know make a difference he did it
already made a difference
that's a real difference
I feel it I mean I feel safer because a
prominent smart person in America
raised a potential peace plan
that I think I could see Putin maybe
sort of
less Resort taking that plan
I don't know I I think you're seeing
something amazing
happening that's not quite appreciated
but I'll try to help you try to help you
appreciate it
um
did you know that there's still
this is actually a real fact
like I can't even believe I'm gonna say
this
all right so it's uh what is it it's
October it's 2022.
and I'm just going to read you this fact
and I just shake your head and like you
your your head can hit the floor
I'm just going to read the fact
did you know that a lot of our voting
machines are still connected to the
internet by modems
not accidentally
not accidentally
that the normal way that they work is
they transmit their results by motive
and so
as of even today
even today
when the experts are very clear that
this is a hacking vulnerability
are there any experts who say that
there's no risk of having modems
attached to your voting machines I don't
believe so
I've never heard one I've never heard
any expert like a hacker expert I've
never heard one
say oh it's okay to connect to the
internet what could go wrong
now
I was under the impression
that this didn't exist
how could I have been under that
impression because I follow the news
pretty closely
pretty closely how many of you knew
that in a number of states in their
important states too
it's like several important states that
there's still
attached to the internet did you know
that
you know I I've seen reports or
allegations of that but I was pretty
sure that they stopped doing it like I
was sure that that was an old practice
that nobody would do that anymore
oh my God
now are you also watching the uh the uh
election denial what would you call it
the the flip
so somebody else called this out on
Twitter so this this is not this is not
my original thought but I wish it had
been it's a really good original thought
I don't I forget who said it first I
wish I remembered
oh was it certavich maybe might have
been cernovich but here's the flip
that now that the polls are suggesting a
potential big Republican win I'm not
sure I believe that yet but the polls
suggest there might be a republican wave
and what are the Democrats going to
start to talk about
election Integrity because if the
Republicans win
the Democrats will claim they will claim
the election was rigged
so I'm seeing people say it was my
service who pointed that out yeah you
have to see it developing now because
it's already developing
you can see it happening now
so suddenly the Democrats are going to
get all kinds of religion about how
vulnerable our our elections are so
watch for that
yeah I mean it's already happening but
uh
yeah I think you're right it was it must
have been a Mike cernovich tweet
um
so there's also a hacking story uh I
guess the Mexican Government got hacked
uh it's not clear who hacked them I
guess there's some hacker group taking
credit some Mexican hacker group but uh
they found among other things
uh
uh alleged connections between the
political class meaning the Mexican
politicians the ruling party and
organized crime in other words the
cartels
so now the hackers have evidence of
connection between the Mexican
Government
and the cartels
how often are you seeing now calls for
direct military intervention in Mexico
you're seeing that now right I saw it on
Fox News yesterday
um
there was a direct call for direct
military confrontation with the fentanyl
Labs just bomb them
now
who's the first person you heard say
that in the world
right and I've told you before that one
of the benefits I can provide
is that I'm not embarrassed by stuff
I'm not embarrassed by stuff so I can
say something like that
out loud and just test it out
Trump said it after I said it
yeah way after I said it
um and
and be because I've been able to say it
that allows other people to say it
because I didn't get canceled and nobody
called me crazy
oh oh actually people did call me crazy
but it wasn't that bad
and then we heard that Trump actually
floated the idea internally but he was
called crazy
but now it's in your head right now you
know that Trump floated the idea now
you've heard a few people talk about it
now suddenly an idea that was just
ridiculous
now what's it sound like
now it sounds almost inevitable doesn't
it
it is it is inevitable there is no
scenario where we don't attack Mexico
you know that right there there's no
scenario in which it doesn't happen
it's only a matter when
so we can you know do it later or sooner
but we're totally going to attack the
fentanyl facilities in Mexico that is
going to happen
so get ready for that
um
so let's talk about yay
so how many of you saw yay who is the
artist formerly known as Kanye how many
saw his full interview on the
the podcast uh drunk Champs
yeah did anybody see that
all right I watched it I guess it's been
yanked in a lot of places because wow
that he doubled down
you know I told you that after he made
his statements about
uh deathcon 3 for Jewish people
so the first thing we learned is that he
didn't mean death as in somebody dying
he meant deaf as in d f but he spelled
it wrong
you meant Defcon as in defensive that's
what he says I I yeah I'm not going to
make I will make no
defense
right so I want you so here's the
context of this conversation nothing I
say is intended to defend him he's on
his own
and he's doing fine
surprisingly I think he might actually
turn this around I'll tell you that why
in a minute now first of all is what he
said about Jewish people
appropriate
true
good
was it bigoted
was it racist
I'm going to say yes
big yes
yeah this is this is bigoted and racist
as you can get
now I wasn't entirely sure when I saw
the Tweet but when you see his extended
interview he is very clear
is very clear that he believes that
Jewish people have been blocking him and
black people in general at every turn
and although he would claim that this is
not about hate
because he would claim that black people
are Jewish also I don't know that
argument but let's go with it for now
um
but he does say very clearly
Jewish people
he doesn't say a few people who happen
to also be Jewish or something like that
he actually he's making a statement
about Jewish people
I will however give you this context
and I haven't seen anybody say it yet
the context with which he was super
bigoted and do you call it racist
is being is is being anti-Semitic
racist do we use that word is that a
2022
I'm not sure if that's a 2022 spin or
not is it
I mean I don't think it is but
it's in that category let's call it
bigoted let's go with bigoted
uh so here's here's my uh not a not a
defense
so I don't want anybody coming at me
later and saying you defended him
because he's on his own
yeah when you go this far out you're on
your own and we'll see if he can handle
it I don't know I don't know
but here's the here's the context I want
to give you
the context with which he said his super
bigoted stuff
was weirdly complementary
weirdly complementary
I'm going to give you an analogy
not as an argument
but just so you can see my point right
so I'm not trying to convince you of
anything analogies are not good for that
it's just so it'll illuminate my point a
little bit better
suppose uh
a white person went on television a
celebrity
and said that black people play
basketball really well
would he be canceled
would a would a white celebrity be
canceled for saying that black people
sure played basketball really well
you say yes seriously you think you
think you'd get canceled for saying
black people play basketball well
really
oh I don't think so oh this didn't work
out at all you were all supposed to
agree with me that that wouldn't be a
problem
I'll be damned
no the way you say it matters the way
you say it matters right if you got into
some like weird genetic things then
suddenly you're canceled all right now
keep in mind I'm not making a claim
I'm saying if there were a person like
that
would you say they're racist now
here's the first thing you should say
yes
that would be a racist statement
wouldn't it nobody would disagree with
the fact that it would be racist it's
literally talking about a difference in
a race that's as racist by definition as
you could be but it would be the kind of
thing that didn't make people too bad
would it
would a lot of black people be angry
if they do that a white celebrity said
black people play basketball pretty well
would they
they might just to get some attention
but nobody would take it seriously
wouldn't it because the context
you know you'd have to worry if that
conversation is going to go somewhere
else right you'd have to worry
if the conversation would go in a bad
Direction but if you limited just to
that statement
I think people say well that's totally
racist but we also don't mind that much
right now let's get back to Kanye
what did Kanye say about the
Jewish people who he says were blocking
him at every turn
did he say that they were dumb
no did he say they broke the laws
no
did they did he say that they were
actually unethically
not really
not really did he say they were being
immoral
I didn't hear anything like that
did he say that they were less than in
any way anybody else I didn't hear it in
fact everything I heard
was that he wanted to emulate
their strategy and success
and he thought black people should be
more like that
because there was something working in
that community and it wasn't working in
his community and he thinks maybe they
can learn from that and then maybe they
should fight as hard maybe they should
you know join together in some cases or
something
so will will yay be canceled well he was
I guess he's semi-cancel now
will he be canceled
for saying that the Jewish people mostly
in America I guess
have been very successful
and he wishes black people could rise to
that level of performance
because that's what I heard
now at the same time that's what I heard
it was really offensive
did everybody else have that the same
feeling like I had two brains going at
the same time one brain was
is sort of complementary
and the other brain is why is it
offending me
and I think the reason it offends me is
maybe the same reason you said people
would be offended if somebody said black
people play basketball well
it would be offensive because you don't
think the conversation is going to stop
there right
it's not about that
it's because you think the conversation
isn't going to stop you're going to like
don't bring that into other Realms
you're in trouble
now
here's the safe way to bring it into
other realms
here's what I always mock about white
people
the dumbest thing that what well I don't
know there'll be a lot of competition
for the dumbest thing but one of the
dumb things that white people do
is imagine that the successes of the
very few white people who really nailed
it
is somehow like we get some of the
credit for that I don't get any credit
for Steve Jobs
I don't get any credit for Elon Musk or
Bill Gates I don't get any credit look
because I got some pigment pigment in
common
what does it matter to me that I'm also
White
that though that those few people who
are not me
they're not me
well why do I get credit for them
doesn't make any sense at all
so even if you said oh there's this one
group that has you know let's say higher
math scores
well that doesn't change my math score
my math score doesn't change at all if
there's somebody who has my same
pigmentation who's really going to
calculus doesn't help me at all
now
here's another Point I've been dying to
make
I'm going to talk about the Dilbert
comic that's going to get me in a little
bit of
cancellation trouble
um when I when I talk about how my own
career
was
um
let's say limited by being a white male
and in two corporate careers I was told
directly that I couldn't be promoted
because I was white and male
now when people hear that they think oh
this reverse discrimination thing you're
talking a little look here's the thing
that they're all missing
who am I complaining about
who am I complaining about
am I did I say that black people are
discriminating against me for being
white that's never happened
in my entire life I can think of zero
cases where any black person ever
discriminated against me zero
I mean I can't think of Ellie
at all my whole life
do you know who is discriminating
against me when I was told I couldn't
get promoted because I was white and
male
white men rich white guys yeah Rich
white guys were discriminated against me
so
why can't I identify as black because I
hate rich white guys as much as anybody
else who might hate them
now of course what I became a rich white
guy
the first thing I did was try to
increase the diversity
I shouldn't even admit that but I've
been on both sides of the conversation
so I bet on the side of the conversation
where I would be denied opportunity
because I was white but I've also been
in the room
I've never admitted this before
I've also been in the room
with other white people discussing how
we got to get some non-white people
in this project or in this group or on
this team or on the startup or something
because it helps
so I've been I you know it's one less
thing you have to have to explain away
like do you want to start a company and
then it becomes a unicorn and after it
becomes a unicorn somebody says uh
every single person of these companies
to white male
this is not I don't need that trouble
so as soon as you're a rich white male
the first thing you do is look to
discriminate against poor white males
and you know I would love to tell you I
was above that impulse but it's just
self-interest it's pure self-interest
you know you're not really thinking in
terms of discriminating you're thinking
about what's good for yourself
right and what's good for myself is to
live in a world that's diverse and
nobody's complaining
so sometimes I try to make that world
for myself
yeah so if you imagine that there's
something wrong with me because I pursue
self-interest in a free market Society I
would say uh that's what the free market
is supposed to do
it's supposed to give me this playing
field and then say go pursue your
self-interest as hard as you can
and so I do
let's move along you're right
um
have you also noticed how this is also a
David Sachs observation the Ukraine is
Big eastern Ukraine it's not even all of
Ukraine just that little strip of
Ukraine on the East is the new
organizing principle of American foreign
policy now when I read the first
sentence I was like what
that's a big claim
that that little part of of Ukraine
that's our organizing principle for
American
for all of our American foreign policy
that's crazy and then it gives us
examples Venezuela becomes our friend
suddenly oh okay Saudi Arabia becomes an
enemy
Europe freezes Global South
starves and the us as a recession
all over a piece of real estate that has
never been a vital U.S interest
that sums it up pretty well
yeah we've changed our entire and I
would argue even Taiwan
the the
the risk of Taiwan you know being lost
to China probably has something to do
with Ukraine as well doesn't it I mean
suddenly everything's about one strip of
land in Ukraine that we don't give a
 about
honestly we don't care we really don't
uh
and then I saw this question on Twitter
explain how Ukraine could end in the
best the best case scenario for the
ending of the Ukraine conflict
what does that look like to you what's
the best case that you could imagine not
that nothing is likely I'm not saying
it's likely but what would be the best
case the most optimistic case
and I tried to answer that question I
think the best case would be Putin gets
removed in the coup but we get lucky
because remember this is the best case
not the most likely case just the best
case
that Putin gets removed in a you know an
internal coup gets replaced with a
leader who's more cautious
he doesn't have to be less
you know less I don't know Russia is
great he needs to be more cautious at
least for a while that would buy us
something
Ukraine stays mostly intact and nuclear
power gets a huge boost
because nobody wants to be beholden to
Russia so I think that the best case
scenario is that the American energy
companies maybe get a boost if we're
providing more to Europe
that could be nice
um
Russia becomes less of a thorn in our
side
um
I think there's an upside
I mean it doesn't look good because
we've spent all of our money
and all of the Ukrainian women moved to
the United States that marry American
men yeah
so lots of upside there
um
let's see
so this is like a small story but it's
like connected I'll talk about George
Floyd in a minute too
so uh Olivia Wilde actress and I guess
she's a film producer director now has a
new movie that's getting good reviews
but she goes to this uh Gala Academy
Museum Gala thing wearing a uh braless
see-through gown
and
I see that and I say to myself
2022 is the year when children have to
wonder about their mother's tits of
asking on the internet
well it's like the number of people who
have to worry about that now
and Katya was talking about that too he
was talking about Kim Kardashian
and he was complaining that his children
you know his children have to see his
40-something-year-old uh wife showing
her ass in a magazine because the
fashion industry sort of forces her to
do that
and I thought this is such a uh
this is such a 2022 problem of children
seeing their mother's ass on on
Instagram there are a number of
there's some accounts that I follow on
Instagram
that every now and then you'll you'll
see that they've you know well nevermind
you're gonna change the topic let's talk
about George Floyd so one of the things
that uh
yay said on his controversial interview
is that after watching uh Candace Owens
documentary about George Floyd he
believes that George Floyd died of
Fentanyl and not from what the coroner
concluded which was the knee on his
backslash neck
and of course there is a lot of pushback
on that because if there's one thing we
can trust is that a corridor
in the year 2022 when every single one
of our organization systems and leaders
are corrupt
one thing we can depend on is that that
coroner told us the truth
so
that's good now you might say to
yourself if he had if he had concluded
that fentanyl had been the cause of
death he would be murdered
and that's probably true
so it could be
if you were like a conspiracy theorist
you would say what would a person who
risks his life do in that situation
would he lie
to save his own life
um I know do people lie to save their
own life
is that something people do do you think
the jurors found
Chauvin guilty to save their own lives
no that doesn't happen never know
all right here's what I say
um
let me say this in the least offensive
way I can because what was going to come
out of my mouth was going to be pretty
bad let me reword that in my head and
now I'm ready
okay
if you tell me that the
coroner was correct
and that he accurately got the cause of
death which would also require that the
the verdict was correct
if you tell me that you could be right
you could be right it's entirely
possible that it's just what it looks
like the coroner is a professional did a
good job told us the truth jury got the
right answer totally possible
if you believe it because somebody told
you it's true
you're a idiot it's 20 22 people
you can't believe that the coroner told
you the truth
we don't live in that world
you know that right
a coroner lying would be the most
ordinary thing in our in our world and
the coroner lying in that situation
would be almost guaranteed
you get that right
it doesn't matter
regardless of what Floyd died from
the coroner could only give you one
cause of death
if the coroner had said fentanyl was the
cause of death which I believe his
original notes suggested it might be if
the coroner said that
it would have been chaos it wasn't
really an option
so
in a perfect world
the coroner only had there was only one
thing the coroner could conclude but
maybe it was also true
I'm not saying it wasn't true
I'm saying that would be a nice
coincidence if it were also true
yeah
so before you watch the documentary
remember what I told you about
documentaries
all documentaries are persuasive because
there are one argument without the other
side
so before you watch the Floyd
documentary here's an exercise you
should all do
you remember the documentary about
Michael Jackson allegedly being a child
abuser
if you watch that documentary you came
away thinking he's totally totally a
child abuser there's no doubt about it
just removed all doubt in your mind
and then watch the documentary that
debunks the documentary you just
believed
and you will find yourself totally
convinced that the first one was fake
and it has been successfully debunked
now is that my final answer no because
what I learned is that all documentaries
are persuasive
that's all I don't know what happened at
Neverland uh I don't think I could ever
know but I do know that both of those
documentaries were 100 persuasive
so when you watch Candace Owens
documentary
whatever whatever claim it makes you
will be persuaded you will be
but if you haven't seen whatever other
documentary you would tell the other
story
just be aware of that you know just just
be just be a uh let's say a
smart consumer of the news
um
I think this is hilarious that Katie
Hobbs refuses to debate Carrie Lake
running for a governor there in Arizona
and that Katie Hobbs won't even exactly
say why she refuses to debate her
I think I know why
I I don't really pay attention to the
state and stuff too much especially if
it's not my state
but uh if you spend one minute listening
to Carrie Lake talk on television and
then listen to one minute of Katie Hobbs
talking on television
it's pretty obvious why she doesn't want
to debate her
it would be a Slaughter it would just be
a Slaughter
so uh I think she's going to do the uh
the Joe Biden strategy of just
you know
I'm just not not showing up and hoping
that that's good enough
um
I'd like to uh bring up this topic again
and I'll tie this into something new
uh I was reminded by an article that 34
of white college applicants say they're
minorities to get to get accepted in
college
34 of white college applicants
lie and say they're minorities
and apparently it works every time do
you know why
because the rules are they can't doubt
you
the rules are you could identify as
anything you want
now I didn't make the rules
I did not make the rules
but if those are the rules
you should identify as whatever gets you
the most money because others are the
rules
now again
I don't believe in cheating
I Believe In following the rules but
those are the rules you can identify it
and by the way you don't need to give a
reason for your identification that's
also a rule
if I ident if somebody identifies as
whatever do I get to question their
decision
no no I do not I do not get to say in my
opinion you are not that thing that is
not part of the conversation so if those
are the rules
anybody who is identifying as something
that pays you less
why
I mean to be when I see this statistic
34 of white college applicants say
they're minorities
my brain translate that that into wow
that's a lot of white college applicants
who are idiots
only 34 percent were even smart enough
to apply for the way that they get free
money
how many people were
were not applying on the way to get free
money of course you should get the free
money
of course I may have told you this
before but when I applied to college
back in
the 70s
on one application
I said I was Native American
because I believe that the time
incorrectly like Elizabeth Warren I
believed I had a little bit that was
like the family rumor that we were part
native American so I was actually raised
thinking I was a little part maybe like
1 1 28th or something like that
but uh
so I applied once as a Native American
and I was inundated with scholarship
offers
I was offered a free ride to college
without filling out an application
let me say that again
I was offered
full scholarships to college
without filling out an application to
those colleges
now I decided that it would be unethical
to take an advantage that large
because I looked at him and thought uh
I don't want to get caught doing this
because in those days it wasn't allowed
in those days if you had identified as
the wrong thing you got caught you'd
probably get kicked out of college
so you know I was like oh this was a fun
experiment but I'm not actually going to
do this this would be a dumb crime
yes Hartwick was close to home that's
true
and
so I didn't do that but today it's
allowed so now the rules allow you to do
it and you could get caught and it
wouldn't make any difference at all
so do that
um
so this week I'm running a series in
Dilbert
that if this doesn't get me kicked off
of everything
I'll be surprised
let's go read this for you so it's a
series and it starts it starts out a
little bit tame
so you wouldn't know where this series
is going unless you were familiar with
the characters so read it to you first
and it'll tell you why
it's going to be trouble
all right so this is a Dilbert's boss
says to Dilbert as Dilbert's walking by
the office the boss says there's an
opening in management for a director of
AI research
and the boss says you're the only
employee with AI experience but I'm also
considering uh shook Tina and Dave
and then dilber says none of them are
even close to being qualified and the
boss says do you have any idea how
bigoted you sound
now what we would have to know is that
Ashok was born in India in the in the
Dilbert comic he's a indian-american
um
a Tina's woman she's a tech writer she's
not even working in technology and Dave
is the new character who's a black
character who identifies as white
because he's a prankster and he just
thinks it's funnier to identify his wife
so this uh here's the background this is
based on my exact experience now I've
changed the job titles but my experience
was this
my boss came to me and said you're the
obvious person most qualified
but
you're a white male
so I did not get that promotion so
Dilbert is going to be dealing with my
exact situation
and it's one that a lot of people are
dealing with in 2022. and in 2022 I can
get away with this
uh well I could get away with it I mean
I'm not going to go to jail but I expect
a lot more newspapers will cancel me
this week
I haven't heard yet
but probably
I would expect at least one more chain
to cancel me
and the the chain is just one decision
can take in hundreds of newspapers in
one decision
so this is continued I won't tell you
what the rest of the series is but uh
but we'll have some fun watching that
all right um
let's see what else
talked about George Floyd
I feel like there was one other thing we
oh parlor
there's so much news today it's all it's
all yay news so yay
uh announced this morning or parlor
announced that the social media company
parlor that's sort of like a Twitter
knockoff uh yay is buying parlor
so he's going to have his own social
media
today
what did I do I immediately went to my
parlor app and signed up
I think it was already signed up but I
hadn't used it
but so I renewed my thing so I'm going
to at least check out what he has to say
now it's kind of interesting because now
the conservative world
will be broken up into truth social and
parlor and also getter right now there
are three getter parlor and Truth
um so you're going to have a reverse Fox
News effect here
Fox News is the biggest news entity
because there's only one big entity that
talks about conservative stuff
and and then the left has to you know
share Their audience you know CNN and
MSNBC and stuff
uh but this is now the opposite so I
think the conservative voices will be
broken into smaller chunks whereas
Twitter may become the you know the the
blue
the blue thing or something oh Gab gab
is out there too
um
will yay rename parlor
ah
Maybe
Maybe
um
all right
I think that's about all I had to talk
about
have we solved all of our problems
all right here's what I think is going
to happen with the Ukraine nuclear
standoff
and I want I want to keep telling you
this almost every day
we will be going to the brink of nuclear
war
but that's unavoidable
right
and we will be go to the brink because
that's also the fastest way to peace
this is the fastest way to total
Destruction but also the only path to
peace because if we're not afraid of
actually dying meaning everybody
involved
they're not going to make any deal
because if you noticed that the people
doing the negotiating or not doing the
suffering
you know you know it would be a better
way to negotiate the end of a war
like dig some Ukrainian out of the
rubble
like of a of a destroyed residential
unit
you know dig them out of the bottom of
the rubble and that and then that would
be your negotiator
and then the Russians you'd be you take
the mother of one of the soldiers who
was just killed
so one Ukrainian who was dug out of the
rubble negotiating with one Russian
mother whose son just died in a stupid
war and have those sit down and come up
with a peace plan
do you know who can't make a piece flat
zielinski who's having the time of his
life
zelenski is having the time of his life
I mean it's horrible in lots of ways
true
but he's also More Alive than he's ever
been he's having the time of his life
he's like the celebrity of the world of
course he's enjoying it on some level
he probably hates it on a lot of levels
but I bet he's enjoying it on someone
how about Putin
well I think he still gets a you know a
massage and a hand job every day
probably every day
like I think he's eating Fine Food and
you know having a good time so our
problem is we keep asking the people who
are not suffering to negotiate
those are the wrong people
what kind of results are you going to
get if the people negotiating don't give
a whether it gets one way or the
other it's not going to make much
difference
so
um we're going to walk up to the brink
of War we will not have a nuclear war
um I wouldn't rule out a a
tactical Nuclear detonation
that could happen
I think it's unlikely
but we're not going to have nukes flying
into America and Moscow
that's not going to happen now what I
think will happen is the the two sides
will settle into a drone War and the
Drone war will be both Unstoppable and
um on
what's the word where you just can't put
up with it
so it will be both Unstoppable and on
intolerable thank you not one tolerable
It will be intolerable
and Unstoppable
now once you reach the point where it's
both intolerable
and Unstoppable on both sides
then you can negotiate
but it has to be both intolerable and
Unstoppable
and that's what drones will buy you so I
think drones are going to be
um they're going to Define future War
if you can't knock drones down and
apparently we can't
not well enough both sides can just
degrade each other until those disputed
regions are just garbage nobody's going
to want them anyway
except for the resources
yeah and it's inevitable that chemical
weapons will end up on drones
I think that's inevitable might not be a
state actor it might be a terrorist but
chemical weapons on drones
and it's going to be Fentanyl
because that's the easiest one to get
so that's what it's that's what's
happening or covet 19. yeah
so here's something that
um as we check our assumptions about
covid
there's an assumption that I used to
make that was Central to most of my
assumptions
that I believe has not been demonstrated
so so check this with me did we not
believe at one point that the amount of
infection you initially got would have a
big impact on your outcomes
we used to believe that right was it
wasn't that basic understanding
and I would say that the the top level
experience with masks especially shows
that that was not the case
to me it looks like the viral load thing
was always wrong and but now we know it
because if the viral load thing had been
true
I think you would have seen a difference
between the masked and unmasked places
now of course because it's data and it's
the internet it will take one minute for
somebody to put up uh what looks like
data to show that masks totally worked
in some place or another and we'll take
one more minute for somebody to debunk
that because nobody knows that mass
worked or didn't work it's just not
known
but I would think that we would have
seen a big effect if the plume theory
was even
half right
we would have seen it in the numbers I
think
wouldn't we
so I'm going to say that one of my
guiding assumptions
about what would work and what wouldn't
I was always against Mass mandates so in
case anybody's joining us now I've never
been in favor of mass mandates or
vaccine mandates or closed down mandates
except for the first two weeks first two
weeks was worth the shot we just didn't
know it was a bad idea at the time
um
but I I had assumed that if you did wear
a mask it would help you
because of the plume Theory
but now I think I have to release on
that don't it
do you like it when I admit I'm wrong
I you know I probably admit I'm wrong
more than anybody in the public eye I'll
bet nobody's ever admitted they're wrong
more than I have it's like a it's like a
continuous thing I do like I'm always
rolling out well I was wrong about that
now I was not wrong about not wanting
Mass to be mandated
because the bottom line is what do you
do about it right and what do you do
about it I think I was still right
which is the no Mass mandate but I was
definitely wrong on that assumption
because Common Sense tells me that a
bigger plume would be a bigger problem
but it didn't show up in the numbers
so I'm going to say that that was
probably wrong probably wrong
all right now Nissi is saying something
that's pissing me off
she says I'm glad you fessed up on the
masks no you that didn't happen I
don't know what you just saw
I fessed up on the mask I had a bad
assumption
probably
but I was always on the no mask mandate
side I literally was
I was an activist for you know
violating the masked mendings
so be very careful
be very careful
uh how many of you are following uh I
forget his name the there's a gentleman
who's a married man on Instagram
who he does these hilarious uh reels on
things he had to apologize to his wife
for
have you seen this things he apologized
to his wife for including
uh he couldn't hear her when she talks
to him from another room while he's
frying bacon
this is pretty funny breathing yeah you
breathe sometimes he faces her in bed
that's one of the complaints sometimes
you know he lays in bed facing her
can't have that
I totally understand that
oh yeah and uh
the wife is mad at him because she had a
dream where he cheated on her in the
dream
all right
uh
all right that's all I got for today
no doubt one of the finest things you've
ever experienced
the live stream to end all live streams
the best thing that's ever happened
uh people thought you were pushing masks
I was pushing an assumption see you can
see how people can't handle
any Nuance at all
yeah so you can't say well something has
some good elements to it but we
shouldn't do it
like nobody can handle well there's some
good parts to that but overall we
shouldn't do it nobody can handle that
uh
like peeing or fartings or pants
really you think you can you can piss
through your pants just as easily as you
can piss when you don't have pants
like your arguments were always stupid
my argument had a bad assumption
that was backed by science
it just happened to be wrong
but you know some of the people who
agree disagreed with me were not not
even backed by science
all right so that's all for now
you can't hear the being subtle but it's
still there
less blowing my mind
that the word subtle actually has a b in
it
it's very subtle
whoa
whoa
all right that's all for now talk to you
later
