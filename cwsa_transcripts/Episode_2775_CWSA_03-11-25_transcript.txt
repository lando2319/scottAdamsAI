here and I'm here we should probably do
a show let me get the comments
working then we'll be good to
[Music]
go good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a cuper muger a
glass a tanker chel a Stein a Cen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine end of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens right
now go
oh I love to see all those green
everything's
working
messages that's what I
like well if you are subscribing to the
dilber comic which you can only see if
you subscribe on X just look at my
profile for the button or if you're on
the locals Community you'd see that plus
a lot more you know that Dilbert's EXE
itive
team uh they lost a lot of money this
year the company did and they didn't
have any good ideas about how to fix it
so instead they're going to make Tik Tok
videos does that sound
familiar it might so yes Dilbert's
executive team is making cringeworthy
Tik Tock
videos well let's see if there are any
scientific studies that didn't need to
be done um let's see according to John
Hopkins medicine they did a worldwide
study and they found that uh if you have
chronic pain you're far more likely to
have depression and
anxiety
um I'm pretty sure 100% of the world
knew that before the study but if you
want to save time you could have asked
me uh Scott do you think that people who
are in continuous pain
are as happy as people who are not in
continuous pain and I would have said H
let me dig deep into the inner realm of
my
mind uh yeah yeah those people would be
less happy and I got it nailed it let's
see let's do another one according to
the spectator index there's a new
science it's published in the bmj that
says that uh
exercise um whether it's walking jogging
or strength training is an effective
treatment for
depression how could they have gotten
that answer without doing all that work
and spending that money and all that
time they could have asked me Scott does
exercising make people feel good yes but
what about if you were
depressed yes
yes every time you didn't need to do
that study all right let's do one
more according to uh study
finds uh a happy husband or wife could
be the cre key to a stress-free
life so it says your partner's happiness
can lower your stress levels oh let's
see would I have come up with the same
answer if your spouse is really happy
does that make you less happy or more
happy uh I'm going to say more happy
checking the science yes nailed it
nailed it again but then it goes on and
I can't even believe this it says that
the negative emotions don't have any
impact so you if your spouse is Happy it
makes you happy but if your spouse is
unhappy it doesn't affect you in any
way um no let me override the science on
this um um if your spouse is unhappy
will that have no effect on you or could
it make you unhappy too it makes you
unhappy I'm sorry I'm going to have to
override the science on this one science
is wrong Scott is right
again so you could pretty much ignore
most of Science and just just ask me
really I'm available just
ask well in other news one American News
is reporting that Michelle Obama here's
the least surprising thing you'll ever
hear is going to do a
podcast she's gonna start her own
podcast and it's with her brother Craig
Robinson which answers a lot of
questions number one uh
apparently Michelle Obama and her
brother are different people so all of
you all of those who said I think she is
her brother no they're different people
and you'll see in the uh you'll see when
the podcast but
um if if you were uh if you were looking
at speculation and it's only speculation
people that the Obama's marriage was not
doing well what would you look for well
if the marriage was doing well I would
look for the Obamas to be doing some
joint projects you know maybe some
Netflix stuff some other stuff but if
they're marriage was not doing well I
would look for Michelle Obama to do a
podcast with her
brother that that just screams marital
problems so I don't know maybe it's just
pattern recognition or something but if
you start a podcast with your
brother uh probably your marriage isn't
going as well as it could have
been well here's the most surprising and
good news I was not expecting
whatsoever um according to NPR Brian man
is writing about this um the fenel and
other drug deaths are way
down now who saw that coming it doesn't
have anything to do with Trump or
anything that Trump has done but uh
apparently there's a big difference and
uh it's happened I won't say suddenly
but just in the last year or so and I
was not aware of this at all but
apparently uh the fenel deaths are down
over
30% relative to the prior years over 30%
down in fental deaths now you might ask
why now the the speculation from the
actual addicts who I would consider the
the experts in this domain um if you're
not talking to the actual people who are
doing the fenel you probably don't know
what's going on you know the experts are
just observing but here's what the uh
the addict say um part of it is Naran so
that's the drug you administer if
somebody's having an overdose and it can
just bring him back to life uh one of
the
addicts one of the addicts I shouldn't
laugh but it is kind of funny said oh
yeah I've been Nan back to life several
times it doesn't stop him from doing it
but the Naran has saved his life at
least twice I think but the other thing
and I'd heard this before through um
just my own contacts that the the
addicts were simply learning how to do
Fentanyl more safely so in other words
uh it used to be that they thought well
if I injected this into my arm if it
were if it were a heroin I'd do this
much and then they would do the same
amount with fenel and they be dead so it
seems like the addicts have just gotten
smarter are the ones that survive so far
are smarter meaning that they smoke it
instead of inject it um and and pill
form is probably just as dangerous as
injecting it but if they smoke it and
I'm not recommending it by the way um
it's a little bit more of a controlled
dose and they've also just learned to do
less of it and then there's some some
indication that it's weaker that there
are weaker forms of fentanyl out there
so it might be some combination of all
those things but
30% not bad now it does complicate
things for Trump with his tariffs
because he's putting tariffs on Canada
and tariffs on uh Mexico and China
trying to reduce the uh the deaths but
what if they're going down by themselves
for completely unrelated reasons um is
Trump going to be able to sort that out
or will he just take credit and say well
thanks to my tariffs overdoses are down
30% it could go either
way could go either way but I have a
comment about um you've probably heard
people say you know why are you putting
a tariff on Canada because Canada only
found you know like a like a handful of
fenel at the Border in the last year
whereas Mexico's been caught with a lot
of it well do you know how that trick is
done so here's how the trick is done if
they only report what got
caught you don't know
anything because do you know what
percentage of automobiles get checked
and scanned with a high high tech
scanners to look for a
fenel of the res of the uh normal um
just regular cars it's about
5% both on the Canadian border and on
the Mexican border about
5% in commercial
trucks um I think it's around
20% but you can ship a lot of
fenel in you know the smallest car and a
glove compartment so you don't need a
truck so that means that 5% of the
potential vehicles that might have
Sentinel in them are ever
checked so does that mean that uh we
just do a more serious job on the
Mexican border of checking so you you
discover more and on the Canadian border
maybe there's less less rigor in the
checking you know still might be 5% but
maybe they're you know they're not
profiling the same or something like
that so I would not
assume that just because the amount of
fenel caught on the Canadian border is
very very low it's indeed very low that
doesn't mean that that that it's not
getting through in larger
amounts I do assume that more is a lot
more is coming through Mexico but just
never bu that there's not much coming
because we didn't catch much of it
that's that's not a thing the amount you
CAU is just not really directly related
you you could argue well
statistically if you know both of them
are checking 5% should be you know
should be
representative I don't think it works
that way because you don't know if the
checking at the Mexican border where
everybody assumes there's more of it is
more rigorous than at any other place so
but it could be I do assume that Canada
has far lower than uh than Mexico but it
might not be as low as people are
saying um here's some other good news
now I I guess I'll wait for a fact check
on this but uh of Tik Tok had a source
that says that egg prices dropped by 11%
recently and that they're now lower than
when Trump took
office do you think that's true do you
think eggs are actually lower now than
when Trump took
office because he you know I don't think
he's necessarily done anything that
would lower the price of eggs probably
just normal Market situation but then
we've got Easter coming where people buy
lots of eggs just to follow them so
there should be some gigantic surge in
demand that's going to happen any minute
now which presumably would push prices
up again I guess but uh it's good news
that it didn't go up a lot so we'll see
if this is a trend or just a little blip
or maybe not even maybe it's just bad
data we don't
know um according to Fox News Andrew
Mark Miller is writing there's a new
study that found that the Biden admin
stration spent $1.1
trillion on promoting
Dei
1.1 trillion dollar of your tax money
went to
Dei now I I think that number might be
you know not just the Dei portion of
things but maybe things that also had de
Dei in them so it might be a little
overstated but it's a big
number um and do you know what would
happen if if you spent over a trillion
dollars on
Dei it would make the price of eggs go
up
literally the price of
eggs probably is higher because of Dei
because if the government spends more
inflation is higher if inflation is
higher your eggs cost more
so trillion dollars is enough that it
would make a dent in pretty much every
price so yeah it's possible that Dei
made your eggs cost more very
possible anyway
um according to Doug Collins who I guess
is the Secretary of uh veterans
something something he just made a major
announcement he said that uh they found
they only checked 2% of the
contracts and after checking only 2% of
the contracts that are relative to
Veterans Affairs um they found $900
million in wasteful spending so nearly a
billion dollars and all they checked
were 2% of the contracts now it could be
that they knew which ones to look at you
know maybe it just jumped down at you
yeah these are the problem ones or it
could be that if they keep checking
they're going to find more billions I
don't know but what I like about it is
I think we I think Trump has created an
environment where his secretaries and
the the heads of everything we got that
troll is back if you have a way to kill
that troll on
Rumble um the the fart
troll I don't I don't know if it's just
somebody or what but it's same
one we see them all the time so if you
can figure out how to kill that troll
that'd be great
um so anyway the point is that um yeah
I'm just going to have to turn off these
comments see there we go so I can only I
can only see the comments from locals
now so
locals I can see you but Rumble I had to
turn you
off um so I like the the fact that uh if
you're a Republican and you're running
some big department if you don't come up
with an idea about how you you're going
to save a ton of money it's not going to
look like you're doing your job you know
there was that uh big well I don't know
if it's big but there was um at least
some friction between Elon Musk and Doge
and the cabinet heads and the cabinet
heads wanted to say we're the ones who
cut expenses with a scalpel so we've got
approve all the the cuts now I think
that makes
sense because it's easier to sell it to
the public if you say well you know
nothing got cut unless the head of the
department who knows what's going on
said it's okay to cut it but I like the
fact that if if they're not all doing
big cuts they're going to stand out as
maybe not doing their job in a
republican world so that's good good job
Doug Collins i' like to see all of your
peers say hey I could do that
too um according to the Federalist Beth
br br is writing that uh this this is
her headline uh after four-year nap New
York Times is going to start
factchecking the White House
again and part of the article is about
how
uh that Biden was treated as an old man
who told told stories but the stories
you know didn't necessarily fact check
and then you think oh that's okay he's
just an old man telling stories you know
you don't expect all the stories to fact
check but when Trump's in there they're
like oh we got a better fact check like
crazy but even the times is saying we're
not going to treat everything he says
like it's news so you don't have to fact
check every single thing that Trump does
all the time but uh
one of one of the things that the New
York Times did was they were still
calling the 2020 election deniers
participating in quote the big lie now
if he ever wanted to know what would it
be like to live in a like a Communist
dictatorship it would look like this
where questioning the legitimacy of an
election is called the big
lie that that only happens from
legitimate leadership right there
there's no way that you could consider
the New York Times a legitimate news
source if they repeat the big lie it's
the big lie as if anybody could know
whether an American election was rigged
or
not you wouldn't know it would just be
completely unknowable because the the
accusation is that it was done without
getting
caught so if it was done without getting
caught that's either true or it's not
true but it's definitely not something
that somebody else knows the real answer
to you know if somebody thinks it was
rigged maybe they don't have evidence
but you also don't have evidence that it
wasn't rigged because the accusation is
that you could get away with
it yeah anyway uh there's another uh
there's a brand new drunken KLA Harris
video she's appearing on stage as some
event and she's just plastered now
the the other big lie if I can borrow
that term was that uh Joe Biden's brain
was fine for four years and then as soon
as he's out of office suddenly all the
Insiders are like oh yeah he he was so
degraded we couldn't even have him talk
to people oh yeah we we had to give him
little note cards or we didn't even know
what to say so but we knew that right
every everybody who is not in the bag
for the Dem rats we knew it we could see
it in 2019 people like me and a lot of
other people were saying um you don't
see that because it's really obvious
that he's not all there and if you just
multiply that by four more years or just
you know you just projected four more
years there's no way that at the end of
Biden's term he's going to be even
barely functioning at all it was even
worse than we thought it wasn't even as
good good as I thought it
was but but we're doing the exact same
thing with KL Harris there's not any
question whether she's inebriated at
these various events it's so so obvious
and still the media is completely silent
about
it just completely silent the only place
you'll even see it mentioned is on
social media I don't think even the
major you know right leaning Networks
cover
it but am I wrong that it's super
obvious I mean how how can you miss it
so you look at my uh if you look at my X
feed if you want to see it there's no
real doubt that she's plastered now I
don't know if it's alcohol or something
else but she's plastered and there's no
doubt about
it um CNN's Harry enton he's the uh guy
who talks about the data and the polls
um you was talking about a CBS yugov um
survey that said 54% of Americans think
that elon's Doge project uh should
influence government spending so 54% of
people are in favor of
Doge doing what doge is doing now that's
slightly different from this specific
way they do it I suppose but in general
that's that's a pretty good majority 54
4% in America it's hard to get 54% to do
it you know to be on the same page of
anything and then 51% approve of Trump
trying to cut staff at government
agencies I'm surprised that's as low as
it is but there it is um and Harry enton
said of the results quote I was truly
surprised really how could you be truly
surprised that cost cutting in the
government is popular with the with the
public the only way that could surprise
you is if you got your news from the
fake
news am I right how in the world could
that be
surprising and he he looked like he was
genuinely surprised so his own
network apparently has skewed the news
to such an extent that even somebody who
works for the network was surprised
about the most obvious poll result you
could ever have which is yeah cutting
waste and
abuse generally we kind of like that
surprise
surprise
anyway um as you know uh you probably
know the X platform was attacked by
hackers some kind of a denial of service
thing where they just massively attack
um Elan musk said the IP addresses were
originating in Ukraine but um as you
know that doesn't mean Ukraine was or
anybody involved with Ukraine was uh
guilty of it it just means that that's
where the hackers ran their traffic
through um and you know the uh the
reader comments that that correct any
post onx well even Elon Musk got
corrected um and uh it said that the
attack was claimed by Pro Palestinian
cyber hacking group called Dark storm
team with ties to
Russia and then they explain this kind
of attack is launched from uh
compromised groups of computers known as
botnets the location of which has no
relevance to the attacker's location in
other words they're saying that even if
the IP addresses look like Ukraine
that's probably just a head fake by
whoever was really behind it
now here's my comment
why would a pro Palestinian cyber
hacking group with ties to Russia be
attacking Elon
musque they would do that
why because Trump's not helping the
Palestinians enough so they're going
after X does that seem like a real thing
or or what about the the ties with
Russia because because that phrase ties
with Russia that's doing a lot of work
ties with Russia do you think that Putin
would think it would be a good idea to
launch an attack on Elon Musk exactly
the same time that they're trying to
negotiate some some kind of deal for a
piece this doesn't make
sense so I'm going to call on
this um I don't know who did the attack
but the whole ties to Russia no uh I'm
sorry you know I I'm not the one who
thinks that Russia is good or that they
don't do bad things or that they don't
do hacking or they don't do cyber crimes
or that Putin is a great guy I'm not
saying any of that I'm just saying why
would they operate against their own
interests their own interest would be to
just stand down and see if you can get a
peace deal and you know maybe get your
economy back on on point so now
the this this is not ringing true
whatsoever well I think I think it's
fair to say that the color Revolution is
on um how many of you know what I'm
talking about when I say a color
Revolution now uh most of you probably
know what that means but for those of
you who don't I'll give you the just the
quickest little explanation when the
United States has used its uh CIA and
its us Aid fun
to try to destabilize or overthrow a
foreign government um it's often called
a color Revolution now that's because
some of the revolutions but not all of
them were associated with a color you
know like rose or orange or something
like that so the color revolutions have
certain
characteristics the first one is that
the US Aid type funding and the
NGS um are behind the street violence so
if you can get say a big Union in some
of country to protest and fill the
streets or some other pro-democracy
group um they're they're
artificial uh the same way the black
lives matter and antifa were artificial
because that was a color Revolution as
well in my opinion so right now you're
seeing the massive protests against
Tesla that's a color revolution in my
opinion you know B just based on what I
know about it because there it's not
Grassroots it's supported by obvious
propaganda in the media which is also
you know a characteristic of the color
revolutions so we always try to if we're
doing another country and trying to
destabilize them you you always have um
the media do this messaging that's
always repeated and the the you've seen
that uh almost all of the the anti-trump
media has said oh doge is using a should
use a
scalpel and uh not a chainsaw and they
all just repeat the same thing if you
were to go to any Democrat who's watched
the news they would they would just
repeat what the news said what do you
think of Doge well uh I think that he's
he's using a chainsaw instead of a
scalpel and that doesn't make any sense
so that's not a real opinion
that is an assigned opinion which is how
the color Revolution works so you first
you assign the opinion and then you
create a fake number of protesters who
are literally paid and you have them
create all this noise so it looks like
the it looks like the public is really
on the side of change even though it's
completely
artificial
um and uh so that's what we're seeing
we're we're
seeing it just looks like uh exactly
that um and then you know the old uh
Elon Musk is the co-president and trying
to you know create some wedge between
musk and and uh Trump it's all it's all
just color Revolution stuff it's not
news it's not fake news although it
could be fake it's
organized it's the same stuff that we do
to overthrow other countries it's just
being used internally against
Trump and once you understand that
everything looks different now
um I I believe Elon Musk blamed Reed
Hoffman for funding some of the bad
people who were doing the protests
against uh Tesla dealerships Etc and uh
then Reed Hoffman denied it on X and
then uh the independent researchers on X
said well not so fast Reed Hoffman
so let's see uh so he denied it let's
see kenoa the great said uh that Reed
Hoffman is a major funer of
indivisible uh a group actively funding
and organizing the antimos
demonstrations okay so kakoa the great
um one of the more uh productive and uh
successful say independent researchers
Independent News people um says yeah
here's here's the group funded it and
then they're funding that thing then
there's Laura lumer she did her own
research and she found that uh Reed
Hoffman was funding something called the
Hopewell fund which is associated with
something called 1630 fund which is
associated with the sunrise pack which
is associated with the sunrise
movement which is funding some of the
protests now that's the way we we hide
the funding in general all these NOS you
money goes to one and then they give
money with no auditing and no Trail to
another and that goes to another and
then it might go to a fourth and then
the bad thing happens um and then
uh and then others have pointed out the
ACT blue which is
the the group that collects small
donations for Democrats but it looks
like more of a money laundering
operation say many that there are five
groups who were funded by act blue that
are also responsible for the Tesla
protests so I don't know which if any of
these are the correct take but there at
least at least three different versions
of how money is coming from the top
Democrats you know the Soros the Reed
hofman Etc and going directly not
directly but through these indirect
connections going into these uh what you
would think would be real protests but
are completely fake
uh president Trump said that uh he's
going to he's planning to buy a Tesla
tomorrow just to support Elon because
the Tesla stock you know dropped quite a
bit based on that and
uh so Trump says he's going to buy a
Tesla um I might do the same if I the
only thing stopping me is it's a lot of
work to figure out which one I want but
uh short of that I might buy one as well
uh um I was going to anyway but it'd be
a good time to do
it
um so there's
that um you know I was reminded of the
assassination of Lincoln and he was
assassinated by John wils Booth do you
know what John wils
Booth's job was before he became a
presidential
assassin he worked in the theater he was
an actor
he was literally an
actor so nothing's
changed the Democrats are actors they're
basically theater
kids pretending to care about stuff the
the anti-tesla stuff is clearly just
actors paid actors and if you don't
understand that then everything's
confusing uh likewise the you know the
leadership in the the Democrat
World they seem me just like actors uh
when you watch the fact that they talk
about how the messaging is the only
thing they got wrong not the policies
when clearly the policies were unpopular
I mean just clearly every poll showed
that their policies were unpopular
Trump's policies were popular and still
they maintain because they're actors
they're theater kids they still maintain
it's just the way they did it so the
response was to create cringe videos
acting uh to do a bunch of similar
looking little uh douchebag videos where
they hold tiny microphones for no reason
acting it's all acting and I I really
don't think this is happening on the
other side I do not believe that the
Republicans are mostly acting I think
the Republicans have real
opinions they're consistent with what
their opinions have been forever
whereas the Democrats are saying stuff
like oh let's maybe we should just
change all of our opinions so we can get
back in power
what what if all of that stuff you were
talking about a year ago was ever
important wouldn't it still be important
at least to you nope nope we'll drop it
like a hot rock and we'll just pretend
something else is important oh Elon Musk
is a danger to the world that's what
we'll pretend today but it's all pretend
in other news representative Eli Crane
and uh this was a little bit
bipartisan um passed a bill at leased in
the house sen is tell us to pass
it that's aimed at cracking down on
Mexican cartel
tunnels now what is not mentioned in the
reporting
is um what are they going to do about
the tunnels weren't we already anti-
tunnel
if we discovered a tunnel didn't we
close it
up so I don't know if this means they're
getting some kind of new technology
maybe to monitor tunnels I always
wondered if you could put listening
devices in the ground you know every
half mile or so and that you would just
identify somebody digging a tunnel
because it'd have to be kind of loud
down there so maybe it's some kind of
high-tech thing for identifying tunnels
I don't know um but that got uh passed
the one person who voted against it the
vote was 402 to1 in the house and the
one person against it was rep
representative Rashida t
t Democrat now why in the
world would she be against the effort to
stop tunnels under the
Border like what what is even behind
that at least there are other Democrat
theater kids knew enough to stay away
from that
one anyway
[Music]
um what's this story um so apparently
there's some Ukrainian disinformation
organization that's uh according to Mike
Ben that's doxing us journalists and
calling for
firings so and calling for sanctions and
Criminal prosecutions against people in
the Trump related world uh but
the that's not too
surprising what's surprising is that
they're funded 42% of the funding of
that Ukrainian disinformation group
that's attacking the United States uh it
comes from the United States 42% of the
funding comes from the National
Endowment for
democracy so we're actually funding a
tax on ourselves
it just gets
worse now you might say well it's
actually you know Pro Ukrainian and
Democrats funding attack on Republicans
but it's kind of the United States
collecting taxes to attack itself
because Trump's the president he's
actually the leader of the country and
he won
convincingly so if we're funding
something that's attacking
that we're paying to attack
ourselves yeah it just sounds like
siblings I'm not touching you I'm not
touching
you meanwhile and this is just so
horrible it's hard to even mention but
uh an infow Wars reporter Jamie White
was brutally murdered on Sunday night um
outside his home in Austin and no
suspects have ID been identified now
I suppose there could be a variety of
reasons why something like that would
happen but in the context of a color
Revolution which we're in seeing a
brutal murder of somebody who is clearly
on the other side of the color
Revolution
um yeah we're we're not going to talk
about murder made he he was pretty
thoroughly
debunked
[Music]
um this is this is scary it makes you
wonder if there'll be any other violence
against uh Republican leaning
reporters so I hope uh I hope Alex Jones
and the rest of them have some good
security or at least they're they're
armed to the teeth and they're watching
their backs because that's some scary
stuff well let's talk about Fort
Knox so according to the uh post
millennial um
the Trump and uh Elon Musk have been
trying to get access to see if the gold
is still there in Fort
Knox now to me that's the whole
story why would the president of the
United States have to VI to get access
to for
Knox do you know what the correct
response should be you'd like to see the
golden four Knox why yes Mr President
what day would you like to come down you
you'd like to bring Mr musk of course
what day would you like to come down
we'll make sure that you get a good
tour but that's not
happening is anybody a little suspicious
about the fact that there's apparently
some kind of push back that the
president of the United States can't
look at the Gold just to make sure it's
there
um this can't possibly be just some kind
of bureaucratic problem right is this
exactly what it looks like like nothing
is real the whole world is just fake and
you know maybe there's some lead that's
spray painted gold in there I don't
know but uh apparently nobody's gotten a
good look at it in a long time and even
if you did get a good look at it could
you estimate its value by looking at it
if if they told you oh yeah we've got
186 billion in gold and then they show
you a room with a big pile of
gold would you know if the ones on the
inside of the pile are exactly the same
as the ones on the outside of the pile
would you know what $186 billion worth
of gold even looks like is
that a pile that's 10 feet tall and I 20
feet
wide 20 feet square 20 by 20 I mean how
big would that
be so even if you had access I don't
know if you could tell whether it's all
there um and it's not like you're going
to take a picture of it seems like that
wouldn't be
allowed well that's that's suspicious
that there's any push back whatsoever
but here's another one so John Solomon
of just the news is reporting that uh
Congress had um not too long ago
demanded that the treasury Department
provide access access to what What's
called the suspicious activity reports
for ACT blue now again act blue is the
Democrat organization that allegedly
collects small donations for Democrats
but uh it's being accused of far more
nefarious use of their money and and
also sources of their money but here's
the weird part apparently the Biden
Administration didn't fully comply so so
the first uh requests came from
Republicans but uh Biden gave them some
stuff but not all of it and they knew
they didn't get all of
it now they're trying
again and I think there might be some
question whether even under Trump the
treasury will give them this
information now is that a little
suspicious
that the treasury might be resistant to
giving uh people who have every right to
it people like comr and Jordan um if
they've asked for it they've gone
through the proper process and they have
all the security clearances and
everything
else is that really going to be denied
to them I think it will
be because everything seems to be
corrupt just
everything but what about those JFK
files
well Tucker Carlson was talking to um
Andrew
Cuomo Andrew no Chris guomo talking to
Chris guomo on his podcast and uh he
said this Tucker said someone who was
being discussed for a job in the Intel
world and a member of the Senate Intel
committee said uh you cannot hire this
person because this person will push for
the release of the JFK files and Chris
guomo said so why don't you expose that
person and Tucker says Tom
[Music]
Cotton wait
what what why would Tom Cotton care so
much about not releasing the JFK files
that he would try to get somebody who
might want to release them um not
considered for the
job that's a little sus isn't it so do
you believe you're ever going to see the
JFK files if Tom Cotton doesn't want you
to because he wouldn't be
alone so whatever it is that Tom Cotton
knows who would be on the Senate Intel
committee meaning that they know more
than you and I know what does he
know and as Tucker was speculating
there's probably not a single person
involved with let's say the CIA who
would still be alive
so what possible
reason would an American Senator have
for not wanting that to be
released and apparently Mike Pompeo was
pretty dead set on not releasing it too
what could be in those
files that are that
dangerous now I know what you're going
to say you're going to say it's
something about Israel but there's no
indication of that yeah soon as I said I
saw in the comments so the speculation
is that it's hard to imagine anything
that's
American that we couldn't show you
because suppose we found out the CIA did
it or the mafia did it or the mafia with
the CIA or the the Democrats under
Johnson you know there apparently there
are a lot of suspects don't you think we
could survive that pretty
easily right I mean we we know that
there's been terrible terrible Behavior
in our own government in the past but as
long as it's in the past and all those
people are dead we can usually handle
that yeah we we can handle a pretty big
dose of honesty about how bad America
was at one point but I'll tell you one
thing we couldn't
handle if we found out it was Israel
that would be a whole different game so
I can see why people are speculating
about it but as far as I know there's no
evidence for that particular uh
particular
Theory do do you think we're ever going
to see
it I don't I don't think we're ever
going to see the uh the JFK file so at
least if if we see something it won't be
complete or tell us anything we didn't
know but what about those Epstein
files what do you think would would
prevent the Epstein files from being
released
well hold on
I've got to turn something off
here here we go um
again people are saying you know if it's
just something about our government
don't you think we could handle it but
there's been much speculation that
Epstein worked for Israel now again I
don't have any specific information to
prove that or not prove it my theory is
that uh if he was a black male operation
which it looks like that he may have had
more than
one let's say uh interested country I
mean he might have been freelancing for
you know more than one country that's
possible so I'm not going to say it's
you know just some kind of Israel
operation I don't have any evidence of
that
but it would explain why we're not
seeing it so I'm going to say and then
cash Patel said he just said this I
think yesterday our team has been
working day and night to produce
documents for chairman grass and
chairman Jordan and this is only the
beginning to rebuild trust your FBI will
be opening the books at levels never
done before I say no I I think it's
 I don't think cash Patel has
the ability or the stomach to produce
the documents that would tell us
anything new I I think we might see some
unimportant
documents but no I I don't believe
whatever this force is that
that's keeping it hidden so far it's not
changing however strong that is whatever
whatever outside or inside internal
force it
is I don't think it got
weaker so no I don't think there's any
chance you're going to see anything that
makes a
difference um what about that January 6
pipe bomb documents well according to
Fox News now you know the story that
there was a suspicious pipe bomb that
looked like it was part of an OP to make
the um to make the protesters look like
they were more dangerous than they were
but it looks like the pipe bomb was
planted by a member of law enforcement
if you look at the videos and you look
at the context so we'd like to know more
about who put that fake pipe bomb there
and Fox News digital has learned that
the record shared by the FBI on that
topic included more than 400 pages on it
oh okay well that's good
um but
uh uh but I think that we don't we don't
yet know what's up with the pipe bomb do
you think you're going to find out the
real story of the pipe bombb I'm going
to say no no there's no evidence that
the public will ever see the real story
about the pipe
bomb I don't think we'll see the real
story about Fort Knox I don't think
we'll see the real story story about act
blue and the treasury I don't think
we'll see the real story about JFK I
don't think we'll see the real story of
abstein and I don't think we'll see the
real story about January 6 the pipe bomb
or anything
else I just don't think we live in that
world where it's even possible that we
would learn those things we might learn
some
 but I don't think we'll learn
the real
story anyway uh over in Saudi Arabia
there's some allegedly peace talks about
Ukraine Marco Rubio and Mike walzer over
there
and um at the same time you you know
that Russia launched a major attack on
Ukraine the other day and now Ukraine
has launched its biggest drone attack on
Moscow um and it was a lot there were
337 Ukrainian drones overnight went
toward Moscow and another city nearby I
guess a lot of them got sh down but a
lot of them got through three people
three people dead
and does that sound like uh Ukraine
wants to make some
peace now you could argue that both
Russia and Ukraine are just sort
of preparing for peace talks by making
sure that the alternative looks worse oh
look at this escalation you better get
some peace because it's just going to
get worse so maybe you know maybe maybe
it's they're trying to be productive in
the sense of you know making sure it's
not a one-sided conversation oh yeah if
you try to kill us we'll try to kill you
so it might be that or it might be
Ukraine just trying to tank the uh the
peace talks either one of those is
possible
um then uh here's some robot
news I'll just throw this in here for a
pallet cleanser before we get back to
some other stuff
um so there's you know every time I go
to social media and there's news about
robots uh it'll be a robot can do a new
thing like do a flip so now there's a
robot that can do a forward flip I don't
care what company it was uh and then
there's a robot that can walk smoother
instead of walking like a robot and I
don't care what company that was then
there's another company that makes
really good robot hands they're really
sensitive and have all kinds of deck it
I don't care what company that is and uh
then there's lots of robot demos where
we see a robot do one thing look it
could fold the
shirt and then that's sort of all you
see it do look it can take trays of
parts and move them onto
shelves and that's sort of all it
does
um I'm going to go out in the limb and
double down on my opinion
that our current version of AI isn't
capable of driving a robot and that no
matter how good the robot bodies get and
they're pretty impressive and the
batteries and everything else so I think
the robot bodies are going to be amazing
I don't think they're going to be able
to do generally whatever you want them
to do um now when I say whatever I mean
within the realm of even a domestic
robot I don't think you're going to get
a robot where you can say hey just go
empty the dishwasher or walk the dog or
uh feed the
dog and you know even if the robot could
know generally where the dog food is and
what it means to feed a dog I just don't
think our Cur
AI even even with normal assumptions
about rapid
Improvement I don't think it'll be able
to do it so I think what we're waiting
for with the robots is a version of AI
that can drive a robot
and it might be it might end up more
like the Elon Musk version where instead
of a large language
model they you know the Tesla
self-driving cars that are you have ai
for the
self-driving um they were trained on
infinite
video so I think the robots are going to
have to be trained on infinite video of
just showing everything a person can do
and a robot can do and and building it
up so that be a completely different
form of AI but there's some precedence
because the the Tesla cars you know are
trained on video so that could work but
I've got a feeling that you know it's
going to take massive amounts of
training and resources to get to that
first robot now I think Tesla is going
to do
it but I don't know if they're going to
do it in a year so we'll
see let's talk about the budget
um as you know our Congress is weak and
pathetic so instead of solving a budget
and reducing costs and all the things
that we think we paying them to do they
have been for years just doing these
continuing resolutions now the
continuing resolution is just well we'll
keep the budget the way it was and we'll
just kick that can down the road and
we'll try to do something permanent
later and then I think they just kick it
down the C kick it down the road a
little bit more next time but uh Thomas
Massie of course being the loan uh you
know Hawk on debt at least the one that
takes it seriously Rand Paul does as
well but uh Thomas Massie says he's not
going to support the continuing
resolution but there are people like
chip Roy and
uh um is it bersett who said the
continuing resolution isn't as bad as it
looks because what's different this time
is that there's actually a reduction in
the budget and the argument goes like
this because inflation is high if you
don't increase the budget it's a budget
cut now I get that I get that if you
don't increase the budget by the amount
of
inflation it is I mean that that's just
a fair statement it's a budget cut but
it's not a big
one and then secondly um my understand
understanding of the how the continuing
resolution which would be the same
budget we always have is related to doge
is that you can pass the budget to be
the same as it was but then you can
still claw back the money you know bid
at a time based on Doge and also there
are some entire projects and groups that
are completely cancelled so when Rubio
says um I cut
5200 usaid
projects that probably means that even
if there were funding they wouldn't be
able to spend it because there's nobody
left to spend it there there's just
nobody to write the check so it could be
that this isn't as bad as it looks
meaning that if doge is doing what it's
supposed to do um and we're not raising
the budget because each of the budget
groups of course they always want a
little bit
more you might be that it's just giving
time for Doge to do its thing but I'm
kind of with Massie and that I don't
trust it I feel like and and Massie
pointed out that the Supreme Court um
seems to have ruled against the ability
to cut as much in the way that Doge
wants to cut it so what we might see and
I hate to think this is that some of
those things you thought were cut sort
of magically
reconstitute based on lawfare uh well
just the law and based on the fact that
there's money that just would be
allocated not real money it would be
based on debt but you know what I mean
now
Trump not being happy that Thomas Massie
would vote against the continuing
resolution which Trump is in favor of um
says he he wants to primary Thomas
Massie boy you should see the comments
on social media to that Thomas Massie
has a pretty good following of people
who understand that even though he's the
lone voice
usually uh that you need
it yeah you just need it um people like
him because he's not controlled by APAC
he seems to be the only one people like
it because he's unflinching about debt
and insists that he was hired to do a
job and his job is not to run up the
budget
unnecessarily and if he's the only one
willing to do the job that he was hired
for well he's just going to stick to his
guns no matter what the consequences are
now there was a time when I hated that
my my first exposure to Thomas Massie I
think was this very thing during the
first Trump Administration where I heard
there was like this one this one jerk
who was keeping Trump from getting what
he needed and and I thought man you know
why can't that one guy you know what's
wrong with him but then I got to
understand that he's just he's just
operating on principal but it's more
than principal it's it's existential
risk if we keep spending like we're
spending he's the only one who's
identified if you do this you're dead
I'm not going to be part of that I'm not
going to be part of killing you I will
do whatever I can do to make sure I'm
not part of killing you even if it means
doing something unpopular so Trump says
he wants to try to primary him um I
think he's in such a safe area that he
couldn't be primar effectively but I
think Trump got this
wrong so even if you agree that the
continuing resolution should be approved
and you think that Doge would be enough
to claw back you know from the
continuing resolution level so it it
looks like there's progress even if you
think that which would be a reasonable
thing to think I don't I don't know if
it's guaranteed but it would be
reasonable to think you could get away
with
it um I just don't think picking a fight
with the most principled person in the
Congress is a just a good play so I
think this is just Trump not reading the
room right now I could be wrong you know
may maybe Trump is so influential that
he'll turn the whole world against
Thomas Massie but I'll tell you the the
initial re actions were whoa whoa whoa
no hard no you you don't go after Massie
because he's the only one saying what we
want people to say in Congress he's the
only one well Rand Paul too I'll give
Rand Paul some credit there so yeah so
I'm um so Mark me down as saying this is
a trump
mistake that's my take and and I feel
like you can't really be credible doing
what I'm doing talking about politics
unless you're willing to say okay I like
this part but I don't love this part if
you're not willing to do that you're
kind of
worthless so I don't like this part this
to me this looks like a trump
mistake um according to just the news
there are a whole bunch of attorney
generals 38 attorney generals in 38
States uh want to end Google search
Monopoly and they've got some kind of
plan to do that that involves divesting
Chrome from the rest of Google I don't
exactly know how that solves the
Monopoly on search correct me if I'm
wrong but any search any any uh browser
you use has the same access to Google
doesn't it is there something built into
Chrome that I've never used that sort of
forces me to use Google I'm not even
aware of
it but I think I think this was a good
idea before Perle lexity was launched
perplexity is an app um they have to pay
for it so it's you know monthly cost but
the perplexity app is so much better
than a Google search that if you use it
once you'll never use Google
again and you could just ask anybody
who's used it now here here's why if you
do a Google search you get all these
sponsored results and you have to Wade
through them and you get biased results
and you know you you don't you you
basically have to do a lot of work if
you're doing a Google search unless it's
the simplest question in the world but
perplexity you can just push one button
you can talk to it and it gives you
great results and um it's not like other
AI it it's somehow unlike the other AI
that hallucinates it doesn't hallucinate
it uh or did it
once I think there might have been one
time I this saw hallucination but
generally speaking it's very very good
and it's so much better as an interface
to search that honestly you just use it
once you'll never use Google again so I
think the free
market sort of was solving the problem
on its
own so I just don't think it's the
biggest thing in the world to divest
Google at this point you know I
understand the impulse but the free
market did a pretty good job
here uh there's a new book out and it
mentions Gavin Nome uh that he quote
bailed out the biggest utility in the
state I think they're talking about pg&
the uh electric utility and it says that
that he bailed out the utility
responsible for California wildfires
because the utility lines if they spark
and fall down it causes fires and
apparently it's caused some of our
biggest ones and uh that he bailed them
out meaning not holding them responsible
after collecting six figures and
donations uh for his
political uh campaigns I guess and
instead of blaming the utility who
directly and and we all understand were
directly involved in causing it um with
their with their lines going down
he uh he went after the oil and gas
companies over climate change claiming
that climate change was you know a big
driver of the
fires oh my God anyway so the book is
called uh let's
see uh it's called Fool's Gold the
radicals con artists and traditor who
killed the California Dream and now
threaten us all okay that's not the best
title for a book but it's by Susan Krab
tree and Jed McFatter
McFatter that's an unfortunate last name
I I hope he goes to the gym
because it's spelled MC F A TT
R man if you gained 10 pounds and your
last name was
McFatter I wouldn't go anywhere in
public like hey looks like you got a
little McFatter there that'd be
terrible uh anyway
so it doesn't seem to me like Gavin
Newsome could ever win the presidency
because this is a you it's a pretty big
charge I don't you know I can't I can't
judge how much of this is true it's just
something that these authors
have um then another news that I think
is fake According to some publication
called
wfdd Hamas is offering a truce with
Israel for 5 to 10
years and this is apparently according
to uh uh the U the US hostage
negotiator um he's the hostage Affairs
Envoy Adam bowler so allegedly he told
the Israeli public that that Hamas was
willing to lay down their arms for 5 to
10 years and not be involved in
governing Gaza uh while the US would
take part in ensuring that no Hamas
tunnels or militant activities would
crop up again uh my take on this I don't
believe any of
that I don't believe I don't believe
there's any agreement I don't believe
Hamas would do it I I don't even know if
if bowler even said it nothing about
that looks true to
me um in other
news the US Air Force has accepted its
first official combat drone according to
David zandi writing in new Alis now it's
not fully operational as in integrated
into their War fighting machine yet so
it's still sort of prototype and they're
still testing it out but apparently
there are two
essentially um drone Jets so they would
be unpiloted that could do the same work
as and maybe even more um because they
don't have to worry about protecting the
human um so it looks like our air force
will be a drone Air Force and that's
that's a real thing so by this time next
year it might be more likely that if we
were to do an attack somewhere it would
be drones um but they're big ones you
know not the little guys but the big big
drones would be the size of a jet just
wouldn't have a human in
it at the same time according to
interesting engineering capil kajal um
the US is launching its first naval ship
240 ton unmanned ship that's also Al a
drone so we're going to have a drone
Navy and a drone Air
Force really
soon um I guess that's no surprise to
anybody who's been paying attention but
um yeah it's going to be full drone
Warfare now if you predict
ahead what would happen if our main risk
were machines rather than people would
that make us more likely to launch an
attack
because we would be all like well we're
not going to lose any people you know we
we can just send a bunch of drones over
there and see what happens um it might
it might make us more likely to you know
wage war um on the other
hand and it also might make it more
likely that if we attack somebody with
our robots and there were no humans
involved although they would be
operating them from a distance that uh
that the bad guys whoever we attacked
would have to respond by a terrorist
attack on civilians in the United States
because if they're only attacking robots
they you know we'll just keep making
more robots
so it could be more dangerous to humans
but it would be civilians not military
people so there's that and then I guess
the country of Turkey is testing a some
kind of a you know laser thing thing to
shoot down drones so the whole uh drone
Warfare and the laser defense man that
stuff's happening fast and um it's going
to be a whole new world just one year
from
now all
right well that ladies and gentlemen is
all I had to talk about today thanks for
joining I'm going to talk to the people
on locals uh privately after I say
goodbye to YouTube and Rumble and and
thanks for joining everybody I'll see
you again tomorrow same time same
place locals coming at you
privately
yeah
