[Music]
hey everybody
come on in it's time for
coffee with scott adams the best part of
your
whole day i'm talking about the entire
24 hours
yeah this is it the best part
now i'm not saying the rest of your day
will be all downhill
i'm just saying this is the best part it
might get the rest of it
to a higher average than it would have
been and all you need
to participate all you need
is a
what copper mugger glass
tanker chalice or stein canteen jugger
flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i
like coffee and join me now for the
dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called this simultaneous sip and it
happens now
go
ah i can feel a new
therapeutic coming online
that seems to be effective against
coronavirus
yeah that's what i feel and it's all
because of the simultaneous step
i don't think that stuff happens on its
own
all right let's get into the news uh as
you know
the uh investigation on the russia
collusion stuff and how that all started
they interviewed this happened a few
days ago they interviewed brennan
and brennan was not a target
so they were not talking to him as a
target of the investigation
however smart people have clarified the
following
there's a reason you save some people
for last
do you know what that reason is the
reason you save
some people in an investigation the
reason you save them for last
is that you're trying to trap them into
lying
because you found out all the truth from
all the other people you've talked to
so if there's somebody that you've
decided
should be last that means you've decided
that they're in the target
zone shall we say but not technically
a target because in order to be a target
you'd have to have some evidence against
you
but the the interview with brennan
the whole point of it was to get
evidence against him apparently
or to find out if there was none i
suppose if you want to take the
positive view of it so
uh watch for the cleveland clever weasel
words
around john brennan because he might be
in trouble
if he said anything that was conflicting
with what they knew to be true
but we don't know that so we'll wait
here's a question i've had for the fake
news
i have to admit i've had a real problem
getting
interested in the post office
scandal or lack of scandal whatever it
is
and the reason is that i've mentioned
this before my father worked for the
post office for
i don't know 30 years or whatever it was
and
i've heard so many post office stories
in my life
i don't have room in my brain
for another post office story but for
the benefit of the public i clear down a
little space
i forgot a few things that happened in
fourth grade just to just make
make room for some more memories of the
post office
and i immediately came to this question
i've been watching the news and trying
to see how long it would take
for the news to inform me about the most
obvious question the one that should be
at the top of your mind the only one
that matters really
which is why do we think
that having fewer postal services
let's say whether it be post office
boxes that have been debunked
or removing the sorting devices which
has also been debunked
you know none of that was came about
recently
those were all long planned activities
because there's less mail in general
but um why is it
why is it that turnout only helps
that why is it that low turnout which is
what you might get
if you were intentionally trying to
degrade the post office
so that voting by mail wasn't so good
the first of all the first part of that
that if the
the mail service is not dependable
that will only affect democrats
so as i understand the argument from the
democrats
that if the the mail doesn't look
dependable and that's one of if not the
only way to man to
vote in your area that
you won't vote if you think the mail
is not completely dependable
even though voting would certainly help
no matter what because
at least there's a chance it would get
delivered
i would say even if there were massive
male fraud
even if that were true isn't there still
a 98
chance your vote gets you know your
focus counted
because massive you know imagine if
there was a
two percent fraud i don't think that's
even possible it's a gigantic number
but there's still a 98 chance your vote
gets counted
worst case and you're telling me that
democrats would look at that situation
and say
ah you know i was going to vote i was
totally going to vote
but now i see nc and then there's a 2
chance it might not go through or not
get counted
on time i guess i won't vote
but the republicans weirdly weirdly
they're watching the same news they may
be watching a different network
but that news is telling them also that
there might be some
risk that their mailed vote wouldn't get
counted
but for reasons that are not explained
by the fake news
the republicans have a different opinion
of it like 98
chance it'll be counted
if it gets counted that's good for me
why wouldn't i vote
if there's a 98 chance it helps
wouldn't you do something that had a 98
chance it helps
well apparently the thinking
i so want to swear but if i don't give
you warning to it
i don't think it's fair even though i do
it sometimes
trying to cut down but the
the belief is the democrats are so
stupid and this is their own opinion
by the way this is not my external
critical opinion of democrats i'm
describing their own opinion of their
own group
that if there's only a 98 chance that
something will make the world better
in their in their opinion you know a
vote for joe biden
and their view would make the world
better if they only have a 98
chance they're filling out a form
and dropping it in their own mailbox
which you can do
because the mail will be picked up from
your own mailbox if you have a mailbox
uh not if you don't and
i'm thinking are they calling their own
people
really stupid because i don't know how
else to interpret it
if the republicans think a 98 chance of
something good
is good enough to act and the democrats
think a 98
chance of a good outcome is not good
enough to act
on some average level you know it
doesn't affect every person of course
but on some average
isn't that democrats calling their own
voters
incredibly dumb it's almost as if
democrats don't know how to do risk
management
oh wait they don't
consistently it doesn't matter what
topic you're looking at
democrats seem to have the same blind
spot
that permeates the entire party which is
they can see
let's say the cost of something but not
the benefit
or they can see the benefit of something
but they can't see the cost
so they don't seem to be able to do the
most basic
risk management or even cost
benefit calculation and you you don't
see it any more clearly
than in this mailbox thing that their
own party believes a 98
chance of something working will not
motivate their own base
how do you explain that other than that
they think they are stupid
i mean seriously how do you explain it
without saying
the democrats believe their own people
are too stupid to know a 98
chance of something being good isn't
good enough to try
i don't know how to explain that what's
the alternative
other explanation for this
now the new york times had his story
that i may have tweeted i was going to
that or maybe i didn't that said
that even the experts say it's not clear
if voting by mail even if there was some
problem with it
meaning that people thought there was it
wasn't easy or something
the new york times says it's not clear
who that would help
because it used to be that the
republicans had the more
educated people they were more likely to
vote by mail
but now that group seems to have
migrated to the democrats
blah blah but um
but they didn't mention that there seem
to be more seniors
among the republicans who vote for trump
i think that's true
and so seniors would presumably be a
little more comfortable
with mailing something because they grew
up their whole life
mailing something but let me put let me
inject
a thought to you that might make you
laugh
you ready would you agree the democrats
skew younger i think you'd agree right
more
more 20-somethings are democrat i think
by far
i'm not positive the ratio but i think
it's it's unbalanced that the young
people are mostly democrat
now how many people under let's say
the age of 25 and this is going to make
you laugh
have ever mailed anything
think about it just think of the people
you know personally
just think of anybody you know between
18 is voting age right 18 and 25
how many people do you know under 25 who
have
ever ever put a stamp on something
if it needed a stamp and nailed it can
you think of anybody
the young people literally don't know
how to vote
i would think that trump would be all
over this vote by mail
because a big chunk of the democrat base
is going to say
um how do you mail something
do i need to buy a stamp uh
or do i need to put like two addresses
on it like one big one and then one
little one
or like how's this how does this mailing
thing
work can't we have an app for that
because they're they're smart
i'm not saying that you know they're not
smart enough to
figure stuff out but your comfort with
something will definitely depend
will definitely determine whether you do
more of it and i would think
young people would be uncomfortable with
mailing just because they don't do it
all right colleges
have completely exposed themselves and i
don't think there's any going back
because a number of them are doing this
bait and switch thing where they say
yeah yeah it's if you give us your full
tuition
we'll probably almost certainly have
classes in person
which is what you think you're paying
for but you know if something comes up
if you if you students don't follow the
rules and socially distance
well we might have to send you home and
then you'll do
online learning and we'll keep your
tuition
now what are the odds that there is any
college anywhere
that will be able to keep its students
from having parties
kind of zero kind of zero
because they're in college they're gonna
have parties they're not gonna wear
masks
and they're going to spread the
coronavirus so the college gets to say
well you know we did everything we could
but you you darn students party too hard
now
the coronavirus is spreading you're
going to have to go home and just pay us
the same same amount you're going to pay
anyway or
or don't get a college degree you know
it's up to you
so i feel like the last bit of
credibility in the college systems is
being drained out of it
and certainly this creates i think it's
creating a market opportunity for
every alternative form of education
that you couldn't have foreseen because
as long as colleges were still as
let's say a positive
looking in our minds as long as that was
like the
goal that if you could afford it and if
you could get in you wanted to go to
college
as long as we were all oriented toward
that that being the thing we all wanted
for for the kids that is um it was hard
to
create a market for an alternative but
now that the credibility of college has
just been demolished
suddenly the opportunity for
alternatives
alternative education pops up so you
might see the free market
fixing that that would be the ultimate
um
amazingly trump called out his own fda
for corruption yet
i think yesterday and
this is one of the coolest things i've
ever seen in government
you know if you ask when people say how
can you possibly support
the orange man who's bad i always look
for stuff like this
can you think of any other sitting
president who would accuse his own fda
of corruption
in a tweet now i'm using the word
corruption
but let me read the tweet and you can
you replace that with the word if you
think there's a word that
says it better so trump actually tweeted
this
the deep state or whoever over at the
fda is making it very difficult for drug
companies to get people
to get people in order to test the
vaccines and therapeutics in other words
to get volunteers to test
uh and trump goes on obviously they're
hoping to delay the answer until after
november
third must focus on speed and saving
lives and then he
he adds the head of the fda
and i'm thinking he's literally accusing
the fda
of killing tens of thousands of
americans to rig the election
or at least change the results of the
election now
before the president of the united
states
decided to throw his own fda
under the under the bus do you think he
had enough information to do that well
it's possible
you know you'd want to hear what the fda
side of the story is
is it possible that this is a little bit
hyperbole
that wouldn't be unusual is it possible
that the president is just using it as
sort of a political
you know talking point and maybe there's
not much of a problem at the fda
maybe maybe the fda being conservative
is exactly what you want them to be
because you don't want them approving
things that would be dangerous
you'd want them to sort of err on the
side of caution right
when you want that so i believe the fda
probably has an argument but
let me pile on a little bit with our
president
i've been mentioning now for some time
the
lack of the lack of ability
to use these cheap at-home
over-the-counter
test strips that apparently are easy to
produce
and do not require any kind of expensive
machine
to read the results you just sort of
look at it
it takes a few minutes and
um you don't have to send it anywhere
you just do it at home
might cost you 25 cents per test
could cost you a dollar per test but
basically you can make
a gazillion of them and everybody could
test like crazy
now they won't catch the first day or so
of an infection but nothing else will
either
because by the time you send a way to
attest to one of these
other kinds of tests it's been several
days
and you've already infected you know
half the world and
so if you can simply find people who
have a serious infection already it's
already been more than a day
get rid of all those people and by get
rid of them i mean quarantine
not get rid of them if you could just
find out
right away if you've had it for more
than a day
you would pretty much get rid of the
virus
in maybe three weeks basically and if it
popped up
you could smack it down in probably a
week as long as everybody had access to
these cheap strips
especially where there might be hot
spots so
i've said a number of times that if the
fda has a reason
that those can't be approved and i think
part of the restriction is the fda has a
reporting requirement
that anybody who tests positive or maybe
more than that
they have to report to the government
whereas these test trips if you did it
at home people would not be reporting to
the government
and therefore there might be some
reporting
deficiency there but that's not really
much of a reason
so here's my take the fda
failing to say yes or no on these test
strips
is such a gigantic red flag for
corruption
that you can't really ignore it anymore
if you see your president calling out
his own fda
for something that looks at least
political possibly incompetent
maybe fully corrupt because you know the
pharmaceutical companies
are the ones who will hire these fda
people after they're done with the fda
right that's how it works they don't
want anybody to be mad before they get
that big job offer
but on top of that the fact that they
won't give us a yes or no
and i'd be happy with a no if the fda
said hey a lot of people are asking us
about these
cheap over-the-counter strip paper strip
tests
we just want you to know that there is
some risk here that we're looking into
we'll get you an answer in a couple
weeks if i heard that
i'd say all right you're on top of it
that's exactly what i want my fda to do
i don't want them just to re you know
approve it because the social media says
we should
you know if a few experts on social
media are saying it's a good thing
you don't want the fda to just bend to
that right
you want to look into it so if they tell
me they've looked into it
and there are reasons i'll listen to
those reasons probably good ones
if they say give us two more weeks
because we really need to understand
this i'll say
very good very good fda i wish you were
i wish you were faster but two weeks
perfectly reasonable under the situation
i'd say that's a that's an fda who's
doing his job
if they were to approve it they say
we've looked into it the risk
reward it looks looks good this is an
unusual situation so we're gonna
break some rules and we're gonna we're
just gonna prove that and then i would
say
fda good job good job
looks like you made the right decision
so i can see at least
three situations in which your fda would
demonstrate that they are a credible
useful organization without corruption
of the type that
you would notice anyway but they didn't
do any of those
three things as far as i know i believe
they've chosen the fourth path
which is to not comment
now if they're not commenting on the
most important thing we can do
as far as we can tell you know without
full confirmation
that's got to be corruption and if it's
not corruption
they could just tell us what the delay
is we don't have to assume
corruption if they could just tell us
what it is
just inform us so without that
information i think you have to say that
the fda is no longer on your side
in the way that you would like them to
be you have to assume corruption
and i would assume that trump is right
about
something fishy going on over there now
again
i'm not saying they have to approve the
test strips they just have to
communicate
that's it it's a very low bar just
communicate
where are you on this question that's it
it's a very very easy thing to ask do
you think they're unaware that the
public
or at least some part of it the informed
part is asking about it
oh they know of course they know
there's no chance they don't know about
the topic
there's something going on
likewise some of you might remember
before i was talking about politics a
lot back in the obama days
when obama reversed himself on his
opinion about
dispensaries marijuana dispensaries in
california
and decided that he was going to put a
marijuana dispensary guy
in jail for 10 years and he'd reversed
himself
from his initial campaigning when he
said oh the federal government
isn't going to get into it and that he
reversed himself and they decided not
only to get into it
but to jail people from my state
who had a reasonable reason to believe
they could start a business
that was okay with the government
because the president said he wasn't
going to go after him and then he did
exactly like that i said this
if he gives us a reason i'll listen to
it
i might not agree with it but i'm going
to listen to a reason
if obama doesn't give you a reason for
this radical
change in opinion that is actually going
to send somebody to jail
for in the united states you have to
assume
that that obama is corrupt you have to
assume that he's been
bought off or bribed or coerced
by something that's not the benefit of
the
people all right he has never explained
that reversal never
you by the way if if you want to fact
check that if he did
and i missed it let me know but as far
as i know he never explained it
and there isn't any other reason other
than
somebody got to him there was either
money on the line there was
something political a job after the
presidency
there was something on the line and he
wasn't telling us
the fact that he didn't tell us i said
was grounds for impeachment
not his opinion on it that's not grounds
for impeachment
the fact that he wouldn't tell us why he
reversed it
and that reversing wasn't trivial it was
it meant
somebody going to jail for 10 years in
my state
right my state he was going to put
somebody in jail for 10 years
because he bait and switched them that's
impeachment
and all and by the way all he had to do
was say well i had a reason i changed my
mind
i was thinking this now i'm thinking
that it wouldn't have taken much and i
would say okay
i just disagree with you that's not
impeachment
but this fda thing is just like that
you gotta at least tell us you've got to
tell us what you're thinking
otherwise you have to assume that the
fda is corrupt
in a seriously a serious way
corrupt to the point of killing tens of
thousands of americans who didn't need
to die
probably for money probably for money
now that's that has to be your working
assumption
given the evidence of today your
president called them out
that's not proof right because the
president's failed the fact checking
before
that's not proof but the fact that they
don't mention these test strips
the longer they go the more you have to
assume it's just corrupt
i've got questions about portland i i
was enjoying watching the highlight
clips from the big game last night in
portland
that featured a number of uh right
leaning people the proud boys somebody
called trump's troops and who knows who
else was there
showed up to do a pro-police
thing which of course attracted all the
uh
antifa anarchists and of course it
turned into a little bit of street
fighting and
most of it was play acting with pepper
spray and shields and stuff
but there were some good highlights of a
hundred pound antifa person trying to
punch one of the proud boys
now let me ask you what do you think
happens when somebody who weighs a
hundred pounds
punches one of the proud boys now
if you've seen the proud voice they're
not small individuals
they're pretty big they're really big
yeah and i'm not going to promote them
or side with them i don't know exactly
what they believe in
so i'm not pro proud boys or pro anybody
else's life i don't know exactly what
their
what their deal is so i'm not pro or
anti i just don't know what their deal
is exactly
uh and i know that it's been misreported
the the proud boys especially
so i i don't know what's going on but
watching the video clip of the hundred
pound
antifa anarchist punch one of the
punch one of the uh the proud boys i
think they were proud boys
the guy who's getting punched basically
just waves away the punch
that like it's it's like this kind of a
punch and
and the first guy just waves it away he
just like he just swipes the guy's arb
away
basically but there was this 300 pounder
a proud boy who happened to be looking
over his his shoulder
and he saw the 100 pound guy throw throw
a punch at his buddy
and the 300 pound guy just turns around
and punches this guy
full force in the face and i think to
myself
and then and here's the funny part the
proud boys were way outnumbered
i don't know probably five to one inter
or more in terms of numbers
this proud boy just punches this guy in
the face so hard i've never even seen
the punch that hard
i mean he put all 300 pounds behind it
and uh it didn't start a bigger fight
that was the funny part because you'd
think if that happened it'd be like it'd
be on
it'd be like yeah you know full full-on
brawl
but but they watched this guy just take
out their friend
and i'm thinking i think that one guy
could have taken all of them because
he would you he just has to punch each
of them once in the face
and that's the end of that part of the
fight and i was
i was kind of hoping for some kind of a
jackie chan
kind of a you know uh enter the dragon
situation bruce lee
where where all of them would attack
this one guy
and it would have been a great video
so if you're appalled that i'm treating
this violence as a sport
be welcome you're welcome to your being
appalled but it is a sport
it has evolved into a sport
there are two teams they wear uniforms
they're trying to control territory
they're trying to score points
you know in terms of the public in terms
of you know politically
and the the police act as the referees
but they only whistle the really serious
stuff so that you know they're not
looking for the little fouls they're
looking for the big stuff
and everybody there volunteered
all of the combatants were there because
they wanted to
and this made me wonder how long will it
be
before the free market fixes this
situation
because now that it's evolved from a law
enforcement situation
into a sporting event in which the law
enforcement doesn't want to get
too deeply involved you know they'll
call a foul
and they'll you know do a little stuff
but basically it's no longer about the
police
as long as these right-wingers are
coming in i thought somebody's going to
come up with a vacation package
called fight club and it will be
specifically aimed at people who
just like fighting because for everybody
who doesn't want to fight
every every 10 people who would not want
to get in the fight
no matter what you know somebody that
for every 10
who are completely peaceful and they
won't even punch back if you punch them
first
there's at least one person who likes a
fight
i mean you know that right you know
people in your life
they prefer the fight
if the police are going to allow the
fighting it is effectively legal
once the free market senses an
opportunity
that is both legal and underserved
you would expect they might pop up so i
would not be surprised to see some kind
of
tour packages in which right wing people
are maybe given a little training given
their own shields and helmets and stuff
maybe a little mace
a little club baseball bat or something
and you just buy a package and you get
on a bus
so you're with lots of other people
you're not alone and you just get enough
people
that you have numbers so you're not
badly outnumbered
and you just go there and fight and
maybe not because you
want to change political events
maybe you just like it now by analogy
people go on safaris happens all the
time
people go on safaris and they hunt big
game
big game that wasn't bothering them do
the people who go on safaris do it
because they
they hate big animals no
no i don't understand what's in the head
of anybody who would do big game hunting
it's not my thing but you can see
that people like to go hurt stuff they
like to hurt big animals they might like
to get in a fight
there's got to be a big market for
people who would just want to go there
and fight
and in that way the free market would
eventually
solve the problem because the more
people who go there just to fight
eventually if that crowd grows big
enough
and i would say that the number would
need to be about one third
of the antifa people
as long if you got the people who came
there to fight
assuming that they're big people because
that's who goes to fight
you know the people who know they can
win um i think about one third
their size would be enough to clear out
all of antifa
or to make it a lot less fun all right
the bbc world i don't know if bbc
world is the same as they got a lot of
bbc's over there
and not what you're thinking but uh
the bbc let's call it the british
broadcasting
uh corporation they fact checked the
fine people hoax that joe biden did in
his speech
and they showed the transcript
specifically the part where the
president says
you know he's not talking about the
neo-nazis so even the bbc has now
fact checked it as false if you're
keeping track
the politifact did not give it a rating
but debunked it by showing the
transcript
so politifact has fact checked it is
false
they don't say it but they fact-checked
it as false wikipedia
unless it's been updated fact-checked it
is false
the bbc has fact checked it is false
breitbart has fact-checked it as faults
uh at least
some components of fox news greg guffeld
in particular
has fact checked it as false
but people are still clinging to it
because our fake news is
pretty darn effective
and here's the thing that i tweeted just
before i got on there
um a poll found that half of hispanics
were in favor of keeping confederate
statues
half half of hispanic americans were in
favor of keeping confederate statues
likewise something like 20 some percent
of black americans
were in favor of keeping confederate
statues
the people who find out that the fine
people hoax has been debunked
meaning that the president said i'm not
talking about those neo-nazis
and white nationalists they retreat down
what i call the
hoax funnel to this they say okay okay
maybe that's true he did he did
he did call them out specifically but
what about
all those other people who were marching
with them
you can't march with them and still be a
good person
to which i say i totally agree
i totally agree who would disagree with
that if if somebody was marching with
the neo-nazis obviously
obviously they're with them and
supporting them it doesn't mean that
they necessarily paid dues to be in
neo-nazi
it doesn't mean they identify themselves
as white supremacists
necessarily but i would agree fully
that if they were marching with him
they'd be bad people
they'd be bad people not find people at
all
however there is no reporting that any
of the people that
trump was referring to the so-called
fine people were marching
they were just there and i of course
have interviewed some people as i told
you
so i know that there were lots of just
milling around
some small part of them were marchers
they got all the attention
but mostly it was people that you didn't
know who was with who
it was just lots of people some of them
were for the town
from the town they just walked over to
find out what was going on
lots of different people for lots of
different reasons and
i would say to those who say yeah but
nobody is a fine person if they
um if they support confederate statues
because the statues are racist
to which i say joe biden has now called
half of hispanics uh shitty people
there's no other way to interpret it
because if half hispanics are in favor
of keeping the confederate statues
and joe biden says you can't be a fine
person
and the left says this you can't be a
fine person if you're on that side
he's basically called 50 of hispanic
americans not fine people
as well as twenty percent of african
americans
who support the statues so joe biden
please explain why you think that
hispanics and black people twenty
percent of black people and half of
hispanics
are shitty people i think you have to
explain that the president says they're
not
the president says they're fine people
joe biden says they're not effectively
by inference um so he's got to explain
that
president has a what he what he's
calling a big announcement on
therapeutics today oh god do i want to
hear that
now what do you expect is going to come
out of that
if the president has said there's a big
announcement presumably good news
on therapeutics what do you think is the
likely outcome
of this number one that therapeutic
is probably going to be a pharma product
do you agree it's going to be a pharma
product
meaning that there's somebody who's
going to make a lot of money probably
if it turns out there's a study on
hydroxychloroquine that it works
or some easily available drug and it
works
i'm going to be pretty surprised i think
it's going to be something
expensive so that's the first thing
second thing is
what is the anti-trump press going to do
if the science says it works what are
they going to do
i think they're going to say the science
says it doesn't work
what else could they do because they've
said that the president
you know can't get this done that you
know the world is falling apart
only joe biden can save us what if
what if this farm this therapeutic
actually is the big deal somebody says
probably vitamin d
i don't think so because vitamin d is
too
inexpensive something tells me
i don't think it's going to be rem
deserver because
i feel like we know i think we know that
and i don't think that would be worthy
of an announcement
it's going to be something that maybe
wasn't on your radar i don't know
exactly what it is
but watch watch the problem it causes
with the mainstream press when they
don't know how to say
it will kill you if it doesn't
it's going to be epic if that's what it
is
now the other possibility is it's not
such a bug a big deal
and the president likes attention so
he's making it a big deal but maybe it's
not a big deal you know we'll find out
but i also love that there's no leak
have you have you noticed that there's
no leak
why is there no leak about what this
announcement is going to be have you
ever heard of that
when was the last time we had something
like this where there's a big
announcement
the country cares and it's not already
leaked
how often does that happen not too much
right
so yeah i don't think it's
hydroxychloroquine uh
that would be the ultimate simulation
great
script if it were you know that would
assume that there's some
some trial that we don't know about that
went well but i don't know
i don't think that's going to be the
case anyway
we'll find out about that um
and let me say this about that
uh what oh there's also a story about
trump's sister she's in in her 80s
and she was recorded secretly by trump's
niece
mary uh so so mary trump is not looking
good
if you're secretly recording your
relatives
you've got some explaining to do um
but apparently the uh the sister of
trump
said that said of donald trump that he
has quote
no principles and you can't trust him
now does that ring true to you does it
ring true that he has no principles and
you can't trust him
because i think to myself i feel like i
know his principles
don't you so here are a few that seem
obvious to me
does the president like the constitution
is that a principle i think that obeying
the constitution is a principle
that playing by the same rules all
playing by the same rules that's a
principle right
how about america or patriotism
does the president have that as a
principle
yes very much so
how's that not a principle and he and he
always has nobody has suggested
that that trump's love of america the
flag the symbolism
the country even his critics have not
suggested that he only suddenly became
patriotic
all right he has a long history of
pro-america that's so clear
how's that not a principle that's pretty
clear
how about the sanctity of life now
i don't weigh in on this opinion so
don't you're not looking at my opinion
in any of this but the president has
said that the sanctity of life is
important
innocent life at least um and
he's anti-abortion how is that not a
how's that not a principle right
how can you possibly say that's not a
principle
how about the principle of free markets
and competition
and trying hard to win and fighting hard
to win
and never quitting are those principles
well they're i don't know character
principles
they're in there somewhere so here's
my way of interpreting what
trump's sister said first of all don't
believe disgruntled employees
and family members who have a beef you
can't really
get credibility from any of those groups
so that's that's the first thing but
here's how i see
the uh trump
i see he doesn't have artificial limits
meaning that
unless something is illegal or
impossible
it's on the table he says this all the
time
you know are you considering a nuclear
strike
never take it off the table right
are you going to question the result of
the election
i don't know we'll wait to see what
happens always keeps his options open
so do you want the person who closes
their options
because they've got some kind of
principles
that's exactly who i don't want for
president i don't want the one who says
there's nothing we can do because we
have this principle here's a principle
don't talk to dictators right
what would the pre what would president
trump's result with
north korea been if he had followed this
little stupid principle
that we don't talk to dictators it
wouldn't have gone well
but you know wherever north korea is
going you would have to admit the
temperature is down
and we're at far less risk of any kind
of war with north korea
it's way less because the president
violated that little principle
because he just didn't recognize it as
important and it wasn't
so you want the person who will do the
thing that other people
won't do let's say uh dealing with
dictators
in say china or russia let's take china
as my example
wouldn't you think that a principle
would be
you're either you're going to deal with
them
or you're going to completely shun them
wouldn't that be the principle it's like
okay
this country and this leader is bad so
we're just not going to deal with them
that'd be a principle or they're good
enough
they're imperfect so we're going to deal
with them and put up with the
imperfection
trump picks neither of those trump says
i'm going to respect the leaders
can be nice as possible i'm going to try
to get a good deal
once i've determined that that can't
happen then we decouple
that's what i want i want the one who
says there's no artificial principle
holding me back i do have these beliefs
in you know america the constitution
sanctity of life let's not have
unnecessary wars
is that good enough for me yes
yes that's good enough for me that's
about as principled as i want any
present president
i don't want him over principled that
person
doesn't have options i want the
president to have options
then how about this you can't trust him
well
you can make up your own mind about you
know
what he has or has not done and whether
you could trust him but wouldn't you say
that one of the outcomes of this
is that you also can't predict him
doesn't the president hold that out as
one of his superpowers
he does he says it explicitly that the
fact that he's unpredictable gives him
advantages
and it does so the fact that
he has a set of principles that are not
the same as somebody else
because his is you know constitution
america competition
fight hard win you know a sanctity of
life
respect the flag you know police are
important military is
important you know that's a lot of
principles
the fact that he doesn't have the ones
that hold you back and limit your
and limit your not only limit your
options but limit your unpredictability
i've said that there's no such thing as
a perfect or
or even a good president there's no such
thing as a good president
there are only presidents who and
sometimes it's just luck
are well suited for the tasks that
happen to come up
during the presidency i wanted
a president who could deal with with
china
boom got it i wanted a president who
could talk up the economy
and make sure that even even the
unemployed had the best chance of
getting a job
done i wanted a president who wouldn't
get us into a war
for somebody else's profit
done all right now
after those things are completed after
isis has been completed
do you know why president trump was able
to defeat isis
at least territorially when obama had a
little more trouble
it's this principle thing apparently
apparently obama had some kind of a
principle about the military he had to
check with the civilian
leadership before they made a move on
the battlefield and trump thought
well that's a bad principle why don't we
not do that
and why don't we let the military take
care of business and then they did
so be open-minded about
uh what kind of personality you need to
solve what kind of problems
i could easily believe that after two
terms of trump
that what the country needs more than a
third term of a trump person
might be something different it might be
that the
times have changed you might need you
know
you could easily imagine that the
situation changes and what you need is
an andrew yang
right because if the if the robots are
taking over
and technology is more important than
other things well you need somebody who
can understand that stuff
you can easily imagine a mark cuban
being the ideal president sometime in
the future
when the situation is is really requires
that kind of a
personality does that mean that mark
cuban would be the perfect president
right now it doesn't mean that it means
he might be the perfect president for
some
future set of situations trump
is really well suited for most of our
situations
i would say the coronavirus was not a
perfect fit because that required a lot
of empathy sympathy stuff
that he just doesn't do as well as some
empathy
empathy people do but i don't think it
changed much the
performance it just changed that empathy
part
um south korea reports almost 400 new
cases of covet on saturday
the highest single day increase since
march
remember i told you that all those
countries that might be gloating about
their early success
might have some surprises coming now
south korea to their credit is doing a
good job of
tamping it down and it probably won't
get out of hand
probably won't but if you're comparing
countries i would ask you
this isn't the right comparison
to imagine that the president of one of
these countries that's doing well
new zealand or south korea let's say
imagine that specific leader
the new zealand president just
transports into the united states
and is magically the president of the
united states
would that person be able to solve covet
in the united states
as quickly and easily as they could
solve it in little new zealand
or fairly well controlled south korea
if you can answer that question a you're
an idiot
because nobody knows you don't know how
somebody else would have done the job
you don't know there's no way to know
that could have done worse
could have done better you don't know
but
to imagine that we can compare ourselves
to other countries
uh is just really not
sophisticated thinking we can't
it's not possible now the news will the
pundits will
but it's not rational um
here's an update on the big fire in my
area i'm
i'm on the boundaries of the one of the
biggest fires in california
parts of the area i'm living are already
evacuating
or at least they're under an evacuation
warning i think
and it is 10 controlled as of this
morning
10 biggest fire heading right for my
town
10 controlled
not fun so we don't know where that's
going to go
but i do think that that 10 is
misleading
because i think they put up a stiff
resistance when it starts hitting houses
and they probably don't try to put up
too stiff a resistance when it's burning
through the
the forest and the the empty spaces so i
think we'll see a
good defense when it gets right up to my
gate we'll see um
a funny story that isn't funny for the
family but kellyanne
conway's daughter who's 15 and she's on
social media and she's saying that she
wants to be emancipated
because she can't stand being in the
family because her mom is
you know her mom is works for trump and
apparently
she sides with her her dad
against trump now if ever
and i i feel bad for i feel bad for
kellyanne she has to
to deal with this but there there's
something fantastic
about the family at the same time that
you know you wouldn't maybe you wouldn't
want this problem for yourself
but i do love the fact that there's no
soft spoken person in the family
well i don't know if they have other
kids but i love the fact
that they're all a certain way meaning
that
meaning that they're all fighters uh
you know if if if kellyanne conway's
daughter doesn't get like she'll
probably be one of the most successful
people ever if she wants to be
because she's a fighter i kind of like
that
anyways uh i have a theory
that is a crackpot theory you want to
hear it crackbot theory anybody
you like your crackpot theories goes
like this
the energy can't really ever disappear
it can move but it can't disappear now
uh i'm gonna be talking about energy in
the in the human sense
so have you been surprised that at least
until
uh last night with portland with this
little bit of
a few right-wing people showed up to do
battle with antifa
but i think they were doing it for fun
look more like entertainment
have you been surprised at how little
physical activity there has been from
republicans
and conservatives pushing back on the
you know antifa
and pushing back on really anything have
you noticed
i feel as if the republican energy
is going to come out on election day it
feels like there's a whole bunch of
republican energy
that's really really pent up not only
because we're locked
locked in our homes but every day you
turn
on and you watch this a city be
destroyed and you say to yourself
i want to do something about that but
hold hold
not yet hold
and i'm going to go with newt gingrich
on this who says
that he's predicting maybe a more
remarkable trump
uh landslide than we imagine he didn't
say landslide but i'll say big victory
and uh he uses this
this uh anecdote this was newt said this
uh you know we have the mayor of chicago
announcing that she's going to have the
police on her own personal street
because she wants her family to be safe
but good luck to the rest of the city
gingrich added well i think this stuff
sinks in at a level of reality that even
nbc news can't cover up
so new as a perfect way of putting
things often
and i think he really nailed it there
there's
there's something that conservatives are
holding in
and when it comes out
it's going to come out in filling out a
ballot
that's going to come out and voting
registering and
and i think that they're as i've said
before i think that the pollsters may
have some surprises
now i did see a tweet and i would not
put high credibility on this
nor would i say it's necessarily false
you can be the judge so there's a
tweet that says somebody had some a
doctor had some internal
polling from the democrats showing that
biden was only up
five in new york state
do you think that's true because if
biden is only up
five in new york state new york state's
in play
what now i i'm kind of skeptical
kind of skeptical but if you lived in
new york state and you watched new york
city
get destroyed by democrats would you be
immune to that
would you just say yeah moving on
or would you say that's pretty close to
home
i feel like and by the way i'm from
upstate new york
uh i feel like i know my upstate new
yorkers
and they would not they would not move
until it was time for the kill shot
and the kill shot is election day so i
think
that there are a lot of silent defectors
from the
the democratic side and that those
silent defectors
are storing their energy up it is all
going to come out on election day
that's just my theory stored energy
theory
all right um
that is all i wanted to talk about today
um somebody says in the in the comments
that the internal polling must be
disabled because the
washington post is testing out the
second
22nd amendment i thought it was the 25th
but maybe you're talking about something
else uh
all right well we'll keep on joe biden i
believe that the
flying people hoax would be enough to
take him out
but i think his own uh i think
i think it's happening so i i think
biden's going down
well i think the uh the mystery
will be if kamal harris tries to take
the top spot one way or the other
before actual election day possibly
yes we'll see all right
i will talk to you tomorrow
