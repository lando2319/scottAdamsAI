oh
good morning everybody and welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
to you it's called
coffee with scott adams and it gets
better every single time
it does really you don't believe it come
back tomorrow
you'll be amazed it's better better
tomorrow
and if you'd like to take it up to
really stratospheric levels the kind of
goodness that nobody has ever seen
before
all you need is that cup or a mug or a
glass of tanker chelsea steiner canteen
joker flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine of the day
it's called the simultaneous step but
it's going to happen now go
so good
i don't know
i can't be positive but i think that's
the best one ever
well
before i forget um an interesting thing
is happening on
twitter this this morning
so some people got for christmas and
adam dopamine is talking about this this
morning on twitter
um
talking about getting a uh oculus set
you know one of the
3d
fantasy metaverse kind of
tools
and let me tell you
you're going to be hearing this a lot
from people who
make the transition from real life to
the
metaverse you can't believe how good it
is
and and here's the weird thing
it's still primitive
did i ever tell you that the best way
you can tell something will be big
is if the bad version is popular
we are
in terms of the metaverse and virtual
worlds and
you know 3d
uh virtual realities and all that in
terms of virtual reality we're basically
at the fax machine level compared to the
internet
roughly speaking
and already people who have tried it and
you can see some of the comments this
morning people got
got vr equipment for christmas in many
cases
and people will tell you if you haven't
tried it yourself
you don't know what's coming
now i've told this story before but i
think this sums it up
um
several years ago now was maybe three
years ago i got a vr set imagine how
much better they are three years later
and
one of the virtual worlds had a cliff
and although i knew i was standing in a
room in my own home
and no danger could come to me
i couldn't i couldn't tell myself to
move my leg
to what would make me fall off the
virtual cliff
and it was the damnedest thing
i couldn't talk myself into it even
though i knew
it couldn't possibly be dangerous
because the thing the thing i'm trying
to
explain here
is that your brain and your body will
treat this as real
even though you know
it isn't
now that's the thing people don't get
if you don't get that knowing it's not
real doesn't matter
you're missing the biggest part of this
you will feel it like it's real
here's the weirdest part
if you do a ride
in virtual reality but in the actual
world you're just sitting in a chair and
your chair is not moving at all
tell me if some of you have done this so
you can confirm this
do you feel
like the motion even in your stomach
do you feel it
even though it's not happening
every person says yes
everyone
somebody says no
really then you haven't tried the right
if you're saying no you haven't tried
the right games
because if you don't do the right one
you're not going to get that effect
but the the ones that
are really make you feel the like a
roller coaster or a flying one you feel
it
you feel it like it's real
and
here's the bigger point of this
i've been told telling you since the
dawn of trump
that trump would change more than
politics
that he would change how we view reality
itself
and he did
specifically we saw that our sources of
trusted news
were
in a way we'd never seen before
that was trump trump did that and i
could see that coming from a mile away
that's why i predicted it before before
he was even elected i said whoa he's
changing reality he's not changing
he's not just changing politics
and then you add the metaverse
and then you add how we'll feel about
the virtual realities now now put those
two
put together the fact that nothing we
thought was true was true
which we're learning that all of our
news sources and experts and data are
all really biased and subjective
put that together with the fact that you
can experience a world as if it's real
within something you know isn't real
what's going to happen to our
understanding of reality itself
now ad on top of that the richest
and one of the smartest people in the
world
uh elon musk
is a
non-apologetic proponent of the
simulation being our actual experience
but now
now those are three separate things
right trump and fake news and learning
that all of our experts are full of
the metaverse
sort of just a cool technology that has
a lot of future
and then the idea of the simulation
all those three things are happening at
the same time it's not a coincidence
reality is about to get a reboot
we're going to have an awakening that
will be one of the great ones of
of history really
when you realize the limits of your own
rational abilities
everything will look different
everything will look different now i can
say that as someone who's made this
journey
from thinking i was a rational creature
and then thinking that other people were
irrational but at least i'd figured it
out
that was my my trip my trip was what is
wrong with all of these other people
why is it that i keep getting the right
answer and all the other people are
wrong all the time
and then
about the time i learned hypnosis and
started
studying about human psychology i
realized
wait a minute
maybe i'm wrong too
and then once you
once you're open to the possibility that
we're all wrong all the time
meaning that we're creating subjective
little worlds and just living within
them once you realize that
you can't go back
you can't go back
and i'll tell you a lot of people are
there already
so you know i'm not alone
i got i got a tweet this morning from
somebody who was
sort of risen to that level and can see
the whole field
and i had to ask him what his uh what
his background was
because he didn't have it in his bio and
i thought who the hell are you
there's something you know that other
people don't know i haven't gotten a
response yet
all right as part of this theme i did a
troll challenge today i like to do this
once in a while
to
demonstrate the weakness of our
subjective experience
and what i do is i i said in a tweet
name one thing you think
i believe that is different from what
you believe
and that's also true
and what of course happens is a whole
bunch of people imagining something that
they think i believe
and then writing it down and then i say
nope nope i don't believe that
or you left out some context so it
changed the meaning or something like
that and you can see that
dozens if not hundreds of people
immediately present themselves who have
undeniable
undeniable
hallucinations
about who i am and what i believe and
what i've done
and you can see it plainly because
because
i know my opinion
so when somebody says you believe x and
i say
no i believe y
i get that right every time you know why
because i actually know my opinion
i'm not guessing
everybody else is guessing
but i know it so even though you can't
fact check the other people i can
because i know what's happening in my
mind even if i'm wrong
again presumably i'm wrong a lot
um
all right yes
we're all irrational once you learn that
you'll be in good shape
now one of the things that people did
call me out on
on opinions that they disagree with
is i'll give you a few examples
one person trying to be funny
a troll said
when i said name one thing you think i
believe that's different from what you
believe a troll said dilbert is funny
the implication being that i think
dilbert is funny but bilbray is not
funny
and i actually addressed that one
because even as a troll they failed it
was like a failed troll because i don't
believe dilbert is funny
i mean even that assumption was wrong
what i believe
is that dilbert is created to appeal to
certain part of the public
and that group of the public likes it a
lot and laughs
and they like it they like it so much
they pay for it
that's all i know for sure
and i'm 100 sure that other people lots
of them
don't find it interesting at all
so when somebody says that i think
dilbert is funny i say
no that doesn't even make sense
nothing is
funny
nothing is funny all there is is
just
some people like some stuff that's it
uh here's another one
people people complained that i said
everybody's vaccination choice was based
on fear
but that the fears would be different
some people feared the vaccination some
people feared the covet some people
feared government control
etc
but others said no no no scott
our decisions were absolutely
rational
because we looked at the costs and the
benefits and we were never afraid
we never felt any fear
we just looked at the information as it
existed and made a call
now that's actually accurate
i would say that's a that's an accurate
push back to my point and i will only
offer this
this clarification
when i said everybody makes their
decision based on their fears
fear to me is a very large category
i'm not talking about the fear that
makes you quake into your shoes
although some people probably had that
about the virus
i'm talking about
the kind of fear
that says oh
i don't want to go to the dmv
i'm talking about the kind of fear that
says
oh
i have to see my in-laws for christmas i
like my in-laws but
you know talk about other people
so yeah you can say that's not fear
but when i'm talking about it i'm
talking about a
let's say a willingness to
uh
pick the path that's best for you
as opposed to uh the less good path and
so it was suggested on twitter and i
take this suggestion that a better way
to reframe my opinion so it would be
less confusing and more
more persuasive i suppose as well
is that instead of saying that everybody
made their decision based on fear
you could put it in a positive way
and the positive way would be we all
followed our own illusions of safety
meaning that
we all did a cost-benefit analysis
i didn't say we didn't
but we all had a different opinion
which i'll call an illusion because we
can't know right if we could know for
sure
the outcome of every person based on
every decision
well then it wouldn't be an illusion
but if you're just predicting based on
guesses and variables that we can't
measure
that's kind of an illusion
i may be overstating it for your
preferences but it seems that way to me
anyway so i'll reframe that and say that
uh everybody's decision about the
vaccination
was based on
an illusion about their own safety
and then i'll add more convenience
so it's based on an illusion about their
own safety
or convenience now the convenience part
is more objective if you had to do it to
travel or keep your job or
make your spouse happy or something
i'll give you that that wasn't
fear-based
except
will you give me that being afraid of
your spouse's response is a little bit
of fear
but it's not big fear it's like fear
with a little left
it's not big fear where some you know
there's a home invasion
that's the big fear capital left
but little fear
there's just you want to ignore or
you want to avoid right
let me
make this offer to you
apparently biden is going to be talking
to the governors today can you confirm
that i think i saw that so biden's going
to be talking to all governors today by
phone
and i think he's talking about covert
that's the topic
give me a confirmation that's happening
today all right i see a confirmation
now
this is when
i think we have to get serious about the
the idea that we should ask not what the
country can do for us and
ask what you can do for the country
because this is the point where i'm sure
i'm very confident that the governors
and biden want the restrictions to end
they just want to do it in a way that
they protect their jobs and presumably
the public as well
so
i think we need to help them right now
and i'm hoping
that the february one idea the idea that
we should have some kind of a target
that our government should
tell us about even if they adjust it
later based on data
but treat us like adults and say well we
get a shoe for february 1
but this assumes that the death the
death rate stays low and keeps dropping
would that be fair
so i hope the february 1 date got
through because this is exactly the time
that biden and the governors should get
together and say all right everybody
bless you for february 1.
all right
rasmussen has a new poll
says that uh biden is at his he's tied
for his low in approval at 40
so
how many of you think biden wants to
continue the restrictions
how many of you think that he actually
wants that because it'll be good for him
in the election or something
i'm seeing some people say yes yes
well so weigh this for me
if if biden could claim he ended
all the restrictions
wouldn't he get more votes
than if
he simply uh
kept the restrictions in but that gave
him some benefits with mail-in votes
which of those strategies is better
i feel like solving the biggest problem
in the world
is always the best strategy
isn't it
do you think that keeping the biggest
problem that we have in place
is how you get reelected when you could
you have the tools to remove it
i i have a feeling that claiming success
would be the smart play
so i i see your point
i see your point that you know there
might be some
mail-in or other advantage if he keeps
things locked down but i don't know if
there's enough lock down
if it's just the blue states that are
locked down at that point what's the
difference
the only ones locked down will be the
ones that he was going to win anyway
he's not going to win florida because
they're not locked down
all right
apparently also most americans according
to rasmussen poll side with jk rowling
that there are only two genders
now are you surprised that i don't talk
about this topic more
like every once in a while somebody
asked me scott
state your opinion how many genders are
there
well i'm not even sure this is a real
debate
because if you put people in the same
room i don't know that they would
disagree
except for what word to put on things
and i suppose the word you put on it can
you determine policy and stuff so it
does matter
but it's such a silly thing
because the people who say they're only
two genders because you know
if you can have a baby you're female and
if you can produce sperm i suppose
you're male
those are my own definitions i guess
so i would say that if you want to use
those definitions of biology then there
are exactly
two
sexes
and if you want to use a more socially
focused one
then people are all over the board about
what they prefer but that has nothing to
do with whether they can have babies or
not
that fear is holding you back scott
i don't know if i have any fear about
this topic
because uh
yeah but
generally you can always be safe if you
say as long as everybody's following the
law
they should have as much freedom
as they can get short of you know
bothering other people to the point of
ridiculous
so i think you can have both i think we
can say there are two genders if you're
talking about biology and still say but
socially
the way people think of themselves and
want to be treated let them have the
freedom to do that
which doesn't tell you anything about
what bathrooms they should use or what
sports they should play those are all
separate decisions
all right
um right
uh
best and worst predictions of 2021.
so here's a little progress report about
where we are in terms of our
ascent to a higher level of awareness
so this will be a little marker of how
close we are to
really understanding our
our inability to be
rational uh the prediction
one of the best predictions for 2021 is
also the worst prediction for 2021
which was my prediction that republicans
would be hunted
now i did a poll and of course there are
thousands of people who say oh yeah
they're definitely being haunted let me
give you five examples
but of course uh
politico just did an article that said
my same prediction
the one that thousands of people would
say well that's one of the best
predictions i've ever seen you nailed it
according to politico it's one of the
worst predictions because nothing like
that happened
now
what could be more
perfectly
let's say a perfect summary of where we
are as a
thinking species
the perfect summary is that we can't
tell the difference between the best
prediction and the worst
uh one of my favorite quotes from mark
twain is that people can't tell the
difference between good news and bad
the first time you hear that you say
that's not true
and then you keep seeing examples of it
we actually can't tell the difference
between good news and bad lots of times
lots of times you just can't tell
and we also don't know the difference
between something that's starting and
something that's finishing
to take the pandemic for example we
can't tell what's smart or dumb
so we don't know the best prediction
from the worst we don't know what's good
what's bad we don't know what's evil
what's good we don't know who's helping
who's hurting we don't know who's being
selfish we don't know who's being
generous
we don't do anything
that's where we are
but once you realize that you get to go
to the next level of awareness
all right here's a
trick i use to predict
things and you could use this too it
works every time if you want your
predictions to be accurate
predict something that's already
happening
and then you'll look like a genius
so
uh here's my prediction i said
prediction in 2022
big pharma will convince experts there
is a mental condition that one might
call over wokeness
and there will be a pill for it
that's my prediction
do you know why i'm confident in that
prediction
because it's already happening
it's already happening
you don't think that lots of people are
getting antidepressants
because of how they're dealing with
i'll call it social sensitivity
so i don't think it will this disease
will be called over wokeness but it
might be called
hyper-social sensitivity
if i told you there was a new condition
called
hypersensitivity to
social pressure or whatever
would you say that doesn't exist
or would you say oh that totally exists
and it's messing with people's minds
you would say it existed right
you might not think you have it
but you would say that oh other people
certainly have this problem
where they're so sensitive about you
know race and being insulted and
who's being put down and what's unfair
that has become an actual mental
disorder
now i don't think there'll be a new pill
for it i think they'll repurpose
existing pills
but yeah
you know they're going to give people
xanax and god knows what else for their
social oversensitivity does anybody want
to argue with that
because i'm pretty sure it's happening
right now
well let me ask the question
how many of you think is happening right
now
is there anybody you know
who has become
so woke that they had to seek therapy
and that they're on pills because of it
some kind of pill
over on locals the answers are yes yes
yes yes yes yes yes
yeah
so that's how you make a prediction with
high likelihood of being right you
simply predict what's already happening
it makes a lot easier
predicting what hasn't happened yet is
hard
i don't recommend it at all
all right
i made this following suggestion based
on all this that uh schools should teach
kids how to deal with criticism as an
actual lesson or a class
and specifically how to be free from you
know the embarrassment or shame or
social pressure of what everybody thinks
about you
because i think what social media did
is take the idea that was already a
problem which is what do other people
think of you
and turned it from one of those problems
you deal with into the biggest problem
now for kids the biggest problem is what
people think of them especially what
they say on some kind of digital media
about them
so i think that we need to give kids a
class and i think that class should be
called perhaps
everyone is someone else's weirdo
so that you would just get comfortable
with being weird
and when people made fun of you you
think
well what does it mean to me that a
weirdo is calling me weird
it doesn't mean anything
if there was somebody perfect who called
you weird you might feel bad about it
but there aren't any perfect people
there are only weirdos so if a weirdo
calls you weird
should that bother you now that would be
sort of what a lesson would look like
uh you could also call it the uh
the basket case theory the idea that
everybody's a a basket case or a weirdo
if you if you got to know him well
enough so here are some of the things i
would teach
i would teach kids how to develop a
talent stack
because if you're good at something
anything
then you know you can be good at
something
and that's really good as a protection
when you get criticized for other things
if you get criticized and you're not
good at anything
that's got to sting
but imagine you knew you were good at i
don't know a sport playing music
being kind to people
you know whatever it is but you know
you're good at something because you
practice more than other people and just
became good
uh i recommend that just as a protection
against criticism because you've got one
thing to hang on to at least
i saw this quote as i was thinking about
this on twitter
i don't know who said it first or if i
have the words right but it's something
like this you would care less about
what others thought of you
if you knew how little they think of you
at all
that's like one of the best things i've
ever learned
that you would care less about what
people think of you if you realize how
little they even think about you at all
you're not even meaningful
i'll tell you where i learned that i've
told this story before
years ago i had some laser work on my
face to get rid of some spider veins
and with the old laser treatments it
would make your face purple for weeks
like it would look like you had a
terrible accident or you lost a fight or
something or you got in an mma fight but
you've never been in one before
and
for the first few days i thought man i'm
not going to go out in public
because i don't want everybody looking
at me and judging me and wondering
what's up with me
and then finally i just got such cabin
fever i was like oh screw it i'm going
to go to the mall
i remember walking around the mall with
with a face that looked like
i just you know lost to
uh
you know an mma fight
and i would look at people to see how
they were being horrified by my
existence
nobody cared nobody even looked twice
nobody stared nobody asked me about it
nobody cared
and was that a special case
no
people don't care
i could have walked around naked
and except for it being illegal
people wouldn't care
they might talk about it but they
wouldn't care
right
so once you learn how little people
actually
care then their opinion about you should
be put in the same box that they have it
which is it's unimportant
it's the least important thing in their
life
don't make it important in your life
it didn't even matter to them
um
and then there of course there's the
dale carnegie method for learning how to
deal with shame and embarrassment
and the dale carnegie method essentially
just
makes you practice being embarrassed
so you do things you know will be
embarrassing such as
giving an embarrassing speech in front
of a crowd
which is one of the exercises
or doing something embarrassing in front
of a crowd doesn't have to be a speech
all right
so those are some of the things that
could be on the class on handling
criticism
machiavelli's underbelly a twitter
account
machiavelli's underbelly
ask this provocative question
if you think that following the money is
predictive this is my setup for the
question
he asked this question following the
money
how has china's economy fared relative
to the rest of the world
did they significantly benefit
financially from the pandemic relative
to the rest of the world or did it
seriously hurt their economy to the same
extent
so i assume that the intent of this is
to make us wonder if china did it
intentionally
and the idea is that if you follow the
money
and china somehow gained from it then
maybe they did
but if they did not gain from it well
then maybe it wasn't a plan that maybe
just got out somehow the virus
here's a better question that i added to
that
tweet in the comment
i said a better question would be this
when adjusted for risk
could china ever have reasonably
expected it was a good play to release a
pandemic
what do you think
if you go back in time
was there any reasonable way that china
could have said from a risk-reward
perspective because you don't know how
big the risk is right you assume it's
pretty big
but could china have reasonably
done this intentionally
if they thought through the size of the
risk
versus the size of the benefit
could could you imagine that follow the
money
would have brought them to the point
where they would release it
intentionally
and tom says can i read minds
no you can't read minds so i'm asking
you this
is there anybody that you could put in
that position who would have thought it
was a good idea
just any human
that you don't have to be chinese
you don't have to be a chinese
leadership
just any human would any human make that
decision
now
there are a lot of different humans so
somebody says yes hitler hitler right
so crazy people would
do you think that the government of
china
could be best described as rational
or uh crazy
what would best describe china's
leadership
many of whom are engineers by the way i
don't know if he knew that but they have
very
very high percentage of engineers in
leadership
well i don't think that china is run as
a crazy country
i think it's run as a country that is
laser focused on self-interest
and we can respect that
i mean you don't have to like it
but you can respect it
because people do operate on
self-interest
countries actually probably work well
that way operate on self-interest
but they are a very rational
decision-making country and you don't
see much irrational stuff happening to
you
it'd be hard to think of irrational
chinese policies there are cruel ones
there are ones you you know that you
don't like
but not irrational ones
if you
look at it through the lens of what's
just good for china
so i would say the follow the money
hypothesis
argues strongly against
not in any 100 percent away
but it argues strongly against
the idea that anybody would have done
this intentionally
there's nobody who understands economics
who would have done this intentionally
unless they were crazy
right so let me say that again there's
nobody who understood economics
who would have thought this was a good
play because the risk is
so big and so unsizable
yeah and of course they had to look at
economists they wouldn't have done this
without that
all right there's a moderate uh liberal
named michelle tandler who's realizing
that
maybe everything she believed about
progressives was wrong
meaning that if you want to be nice to
people progressive policies might get
you the wrong outcome
scott they did it for economics
did you miss the entire conversation
nobody would have done this for
economics
there's one there's one category i can
speak of with some confidence i do have
two degrees that are relevant to this
question
nobody would do it intentionally for
economics
now if you're not an economist
you should talk to one
because if you can find anybody
let me ask you this find somebody who's
got an mba from a good school
or a degree in economics and ask them if
it looked like a good financial play
for china to release a pandemic
you're not going to get anybody to say
that
you know but if you're talking to an
artist or something
they might say that
short term baby well the point is that
you couldn't calculate the short term or
the long term impact
all right
anyway this uh
this moderate liberal michelle chandler
did an interesting tweet thread
and she says uh here's what confuses me
about san francisco we have the most
liberal left-wing government and
population in the country we have a 13
billion dollar budget
and we have 80 000 people sleeping in
the rain this week
can someone please explain this to me
and then she goes on in the thread
talking about how
her uh prior impression that the
progressives would be better
for the underclass
appears to be wrong and that maybe some
you know i'm these are my own words now
to try to capture the theme of it but
there may be some tough love
more close to what the right would
suggest might be a little closer to the
the kindest thing you could do so if if
being kind to people is what you want
the progressives may have the wrong
solution now it does i don't know if
she's factored into this how many people
actually don't want to be in a home
because they want to do drugs instead
but
um
seeing her awaken like this is
interesting and you get toward the end
of the tweet thread and you find out
that she just she's reading
she's writing she's reading michael
schellenberger's new book san fran sicko
and which is a huge bestseller and so
you can see her being persuaded
in real time
you can actually watch her
being
transparent about her thought process
being modified by that book
did i tell you that michael
schellenberger is persuasive
you're seeing it everywhere
he's very persuasive
yeah
and uh part of his appeal is that you
can't tell what political side he's on
it's just unfathomable because he just
does things that make sense
and have some kind of data or scientific
backing
and you can't tell what he's up to
because it just looks like a bunch of
good ideas
backed by solid argument and data
let's see here's a thought big pharma is
creating an economic agenda to make all
humans forced to be consumers of their
products
how much more financial incentive do you
need
well that would be the pharma companies
but we're talking about china's
government
so if you're asking me
do i trust a big pharma i think big
pharma is should be a category in which
we assume guilt until proven innocence
for big pharma i think you should
approve
assume guilt
until proven innocent
whereas i wouldn't say that about most
things but i think the um given the size
of the risks
with any kind of medication and the
history of the industry
it would be irrational to think
otherwise and that's of course why you
do the randomized controlled trials
yeah the pandemic caused every strong
economy to shut down except china's but
it also turned people against china
so
as much as anything it will be the
reason that the united states starts to
migrate its manufacturing out of there
so
i don't think they could have known that
was a good idea
they would have known that was risky and
china is not the super risky country
right
china tends to not take risks
so does it make sense that the country
most famous for not taking risks
took the biggest risk anybody had ever
taken as a country
i mean maybe hitler took a bigger risk
but
special case
um yes in order to get rid of trump no i
don't think i don't think that was a big
enough
reason
why do you keep saying randomized
controlled trials are the only method
capable of demonstrating causality well
actually i don't say that because even
the randomized controlled trial doesn't
demonstrate causality
does it
check me on that
a randomized controlled trial doesn't
tell you causality right
does it
it tells you correlation doesn't it
and then you have to use your judgment
or something like it
to determine whether it was causal
or causality was involved
hasn't a randomized controlled trial
ever been duplicated
the answer is yes
but it's a funny question
um
trial is about causality no i know that
the point of a randomized controlled
trial
is to determine causality but it doesn't
do that it just gets you close right
yeah i guess all i'm arguing is it
doesn't it doesn't complete the distance
it just gets you close enough
that your judgment has to
suffice for the rest of it
all right
so that's all i got for today uh no
doubt the best show that's ever been
broadcast anywhere at any time
and
when does trump stop making news again
on being asked
i i think that no matter what whether he
runs for office or he creates a platform
to
influence politics
his instinct is to stay in the news and
he's good at it
scott plenty of people chose the option
they're more afraid of that is less
convenient
right
they did a cost-benefit analysis
everybody everybody did that
um
all right metaverse i talked about the
metaverse so i thank you for reminding
me but i said what i wanted to say about
that
um
yeah i just wanted to tie the metaverse
into the simulation and into the
virtual reality stuff
trump is compromised by big pharma you
know i doubt that
i doubt that
i feel like trump might be one of the
few people you could depend on not to be
compromised by big pharma
only because he's never had an
association with him before
that i'm aware of
and it would be obvious and i don't
think he's a fan and he's a skeptic
what's that in all caps there you're
yelling at me
um
would it be a good business move for a
big pharma to support omicron spread
well the problem is
you don't want to be the one who says
the omicron's safe
you know unless you're me right
unless you can handle the blowback
but i don't think if you're somebody
official like an expert you don't want
to go so far as to say it's safe
or even to recommend it instead of a
vaccination
that would that would be risky i think
what about the iodine iodine nose spray
solution discussed on joe rogan
well i don't know about that
but i do know that the idea of
spraying something into your nose to
kill the virus that's obviously there
that's been talked about a lot but i
don't know that um
unless you were doing it on the regular
wouldn't all the virus repopulate pretty
quickly
maybe that's a
question for a doctor
i'll ask that question when i talk to dr
drew i think i'm scheduled to talk to
him
tonight so look for that
and
i don't think it's bleach but it does
make sense that
clearing out your nose
would get rid of some virus i just don't
know if it lasts an hour
you know is it back in an hour
i don't know
so i use i use a mouthwash
several times a day
probably overuse it usually related to
my other habits but um
i wonder if i wonder if you did a test
of people who used just a regular
mouthwash five times a day
i bet their odds of covet
are lower or better outcomes because
their viral load was lower
is god the author of the simulation
um
you would only need god for the original
species
and after that
everything else would be people
so
even if there is a god for the
simulation
it's unlikely that you're in one of the
ones created by the god directly
why did they work so hard to withhold
ivermectin
you know
let me let me ask you in the comments i
just want to see where your heads are at
so before i give you my updated opinion
how many of you think that in the end we
will learn
that ivermectin would have worked
if we had gone gung-ho and done it early
and
all that how many think that it wouldn't
work
i'm saying uh mostly yeses
some knows but mostly yes's on locals
how about over here
on uh
youtube i'm seeing a
mix got real got real quiet on youtube
there for a minute
more no's and yeses
no actually about even
um
you're somebody i never saw this coming
scott likes masks in china
i don't know
what thing you were watching but
i'm gonna make you go away
goodbye
all right
so i'll give you my uh most current take
on ivermectin
um i don't rule it out
if you're
if anybody says to me there was a global
conspiracy
to
to suppress something that worked
because it was cheap and it let people
sell vaccines i would say there's
nothing about that
that's impossible
because there's a mechanism for it and
the mechanism would be
that the pharma companies would only
have to get to a few experts
which we know they can do and have done
and it's a routine thing you get to a
few experts
you have those few experts define what
is real and what is not and then
everybody else just falls in line
because
you know most countries were just
following the united states weren't they
so
remember one of my initial objections
was are you telling me that there's no
country anywhere
where they've tried it and then we could
know for sure if it worked nowhere
there's not one place that they tried it
and it worked
and then people come up with all the
places that it was tried and it didn't
work
but they believe it did including india
peru
there's a few more the people imagine
worked but if you actually look at the
current numbers there's no indication of
it
now that doesn't mean it doesn't work
i'm just saying that the country
examples were not real but they look
real a lot of people japan there's
another one that's not real
so all of the country ones are not real
but you'd have to do
if you want to test that for yourself
just uh google the country and
ivermectin and debunk
all the debunks pop right up and it's
just data
you just look at the data it's not there
now
my current take is although it is
completely possible
that big pharma suppressed ivermectin
and that it you know maybe it did work
totally possible
i think every day that goes by
that there isn't some rogue city country
county
that believes the same thing a lot of
you guys do
which is it definitely works and we're
being fooled
you don't think there was one hospital
one city
one county anywhere in the world
where somebody had the same opinion that
almost all of you have
which is that we're being fooled and it
probably works
i don't think that's possible
i think you could get 90
like you could suppress it 90
but given that most of you
think it's the suppression of
it
i think the majority of you said you
don't believe that it doesn't work
given that
i don't see any chance we could have
gotten to where we are
without at least one hospital using it
and saying hey
it's been two years and nobody's died
here
seriously not one hospital now there are
uh individual doctors who have tried it
but that's not a standard i would i
would use
because
you know 99 of the doctor's patients are
going to survive right
no matter what they do
as long as it's not dangerous
uh why are doctors still prescribing it
well the same reason they're prescribing
it for the same reason that i'd be
tempted to take it
because you don't know
there's plenty of studies that
you know are not quite as high quality
as you'd want
that indicate it might
and the risk is low
so there's no miscrea there's no mystery
about why doctors prescribe it
it's just risk management
but that doesn't tell you it works
yeah no one died is too high a standard
for it worked
yeah i mean you shouldn't take that as a
absolute no one
yeah all the stories you hear about
there's a country that solves their
problem with x none of them are true
if any country had solved their covet
problem by doing x
whatever x is
it'd be over
we'd just all be doing x by next week
and it'd be over
so no that didn't happen
scott people shouldn't be banned from
talking about it
yeah you know
i don't know if it worked though
because there's there's two questions i
would agree with you that free speech
requires that those things not be banned
what i'm not sure of is if it worked
from the perspective of the people who
banned it in other words did it make
it more likely that you would avoid it
and get
you know the more approved treatments i
don't know might have
that doesn't mean you should do it but
it might have worked
what is the vast survival rate better
than 99.8
the last numbers i saw is that the vast
survival rate
is something like 90 better than the
unvaxed once you get to that
but that's after you're already pretty
sick
i think i think that's how that works
how do we know that
well
data
which we don't trust
uh
blake jamison says you you disappoint me
more and more every day all right blake
let me give you a little test here of
your cognitive dissonance
i want blake blake jameson i challenge
you now
in your next comment
state what you think i believe
that you disagree with go
blake you're on
shouldn't take you long
if i miss blake's comment alert me to it
go
now the challenge is to say something
that's not obviously cognitive
dissonance which would be
you stating an opinion for me that i
clearly don't hold
see if you can do that
bet you can't
now there's a reason why you can't
did you just disappear or is there a
delay here
have you ever had the forgotten man no
why are most african countries and many
in eastern europe totally ignoring kovid
well they the lack of comorbidities
would be my guess so the the average age
in africa let's just pick africa
uh the average age is way younger than
normal the average weight way younger
the amount of time they spend in the
sunshine way more
uh so if everything was exactly the way
we expected
africa could look exactly the way it
looks without any
without any uh
mystery there at all
uh i missed blake's comment okay
let's go back like blink blink blink
blink blink
damn it where are you
all right uh you believe that your
thinking is above others
no blake
[Laughter]
i don't know how much more clear i could
be that we're all guessing
or how many more times i can say it
anyway
did i make my case when you see the
people who say stuff like you disappoint
me and you're wrong about everything
they almost never have a clear
understanding of what my opinion is
and starseed says sorry scott
he is right about that
so when i say that we're all just
guessing and making rational decisions
does that not cover everything
now
i did write a book on how to think well
which is very critically praised
so you if you're telling somebody that
they uh
that they're
not good at thinking
you should probably talk to somebody who
didn't just write a bestselling book on
how to think better
that would be a good start
so no do i do i think that i uh think
better than other people
i think that i think it
meaning that
you can see lots of examples of it for
example poor blake yeah let me not dunk
on him anymore all right that's all i
got for now and i will talk to you all
soon
