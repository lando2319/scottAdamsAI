morning everybody and welcome
to the highlighted civilization that's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never been luckier than you are
at this moment if you're here live and
if you're watching it recorded
second luckiest group of people in the
world because this is going to be
awesome every day it is and sometimes it
just keeps getting better and if you'd
like today to be amazing
all you need is a copper mugger a glass
of take your chalices die in a canteen
Joker flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
thing that makes everything better
there's a little bit of oxytocin in this
one yeah it's special and uh join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's
called the simultaneous app go
ah
I feel some of you were not simultaneous
with that
you'll need to work on your simultaneity
to get the most benefits from
all right well uh let's talk about the
news
uh Chris Christie is going to be running
for president
what to say about that
he's a running for president uh
and he is our and he's Chris Christie
and he's running for president
and if I ever mentioned he's running for
president and his name is Chris Christie
I feel as though everything else we say
about this is a waste of words isn't it
because
nobody's really expecting our president
Chris Christie are they
and I don't feel this time I don't feel
like he's running for vice president
in the past you might have said he might
be running for vice president really
he's not really running for vice
president
so what exactly is he doing
maybe his job is to take out some of uh
Trump's competitors
maybe his job is to take DeSantis out in
a debate
I don't know the whole thing seems
puzzling
does Chris Christie think he has a
chance
because it makes sense to run if you
think there's some publicity benefit
yeah you're selling a book if you're
selling a book that's a good idea
but I don't really see his play do you
what's the play
how in the world does that help him
exactly just make his speaking fees go
up because he ran for president again
I don't know I'm just confused by the
whole thing
have uh have any of you seen the uh
video of trump mocking Joe Biden for not
knowing where to walk after he's done
talking
it's some of Trump's best work
but now there's a there's a video I saw
in truth Dan scavino tweeted around that
shows a split screen
so you won't be able to see it well but
I just have to show you the Artistry of
this
so
is it playing
come on play do you think at least one
time you get up and say I'm running for
president uh where where am I going
where the hell if I go I want to get out
oh no over there
[Applause]
oh
so
there's one thing I'm going to say with
complete confidence
I don't know who the best president
would be
like you know let's have a little
humility we don't really know I mean
it's hard to predict who the best
president would be but there's one thing
I can say for sure
Trump would be the funniest
he's the funniest president
I mean Reagan was pretty funny
and I thought you know Clinton and Obama
could deliver a punch line okay but
Trump is genuinely hilarious
if you like that kind of thing
um
yeah anyway uh I like that
so Kerry lake at a uh an interesting
quote that was so trump-like
that it made news but so she was asked
about you know being a vice president if
she wanted to be a vice president
candidate with Trump and she said quote
I don't think he needs a vice president
if there's ever one president who still
who's so strong he doesn't need one it
would be him
foreign
that
just
just uh I'm going to read it again but
this time here uh Trump's own voice
right it's a Kerry Lake quote but this
is a pure trumpism no nobody but Trump
would have ever said this until Trump
existed and and now she's saying it but
here's my take I think she's pacing him
I think she's just acting exactly like
he acts so that she'll look like a
better choice for vice president can you
think of a better thing
if if you really wanted to be the vice
presidential pick could you think of a
better way to say it then he's the only
president who doesn't even need a vice
president he's so strong
it sounds like something that Trump
himself would say or put in the words of
his own doctor do you remember when his
doctor said he's like the strongest
person in the world or something
and you knew you knew that Trump wrote
it which is what made it funny it was
funny because it was obvious that Trump
wrote it himself
well this is that
it it's hilarious because it's so
ridiculous
but it's also hilarious because she
seems to be matching or pacing Trump
basically acting like him
to be more let's say compatible with
them it's pretty funny and also pretty
good pretty good technique
all right
so this this story is more of the uh
everything you thought was true was true
but if they wait long enough your
outrage is wearing off
have you noticed that the Democrats seem
to have that technique hey we think
you're I don't know whatever sacrificing
babies and Satanic rituals no or not oh
that is so ridiculous conspiracy there
is we're not doing that and then then
two years ago spy
and then somehow you find out every
benefit is true
but you started to wear out your rage
and started to wear off you're like yeah
we told you
well that was two two years ago yeah
well are they doing it still I don't
know I just can't get as angry about it
because it was so old
they just make you get used to anything
and that they do it over and over again
it's like oh yeah they really did do
that thing I guess they did try to well
okay yes they did try to overthrow the
government of the United States with you
know that laptop fake letter and the
Russia collusion but that was that was a
few years ago
and it didn't work out and I don't know
I just can't get mad about it like I
could have in the past
yeah
so here's something we found out along
those lines uh Elon Musk was weighing in
on this with in he was a
he was having the same reaction you're
gonna have which is one of the reasons
that the FBI says it won't release the
January 6 surveillance videos as it
would show quote too many undercover
government agents and informants
and so musk weighed in and said uh uh
this is insane how many were there I
mean just approximately
like uh are we talking dozens
we talk in
up to 10
are we talking thousands
hundreds
you know just give us a ballpark just
give us a sense of the general structure
there well then Michael zellenberger
responded with some source
uh they said it was 100 to 200.
informants or agents under basically
under government government people one
to two hundred
now when you hear a decimal like that do
you think it's more likely on the low
side or more likely on the high side
because two hundreds
twice as much as 100.
yeah I don't know
where will the information come from
there's only one place it could come
from right would have to come from a
government source
would a government source
want to lowball the number or eyeball
the number
if it came from a government Source
would they want to tell you the most it
was or would they find a way to sort of
minimize it by you know maybe counting
these people as not exactly undercover
oh yeah they were in Disguise but they
weren't you know technically undercover
you know they were lowballed probably if
it came from an official Source because
they wouldn't want you to think it was a
high number
um
if there were really
if there were really 200 undercover
people
and we're just finding that out
wouldn't that be enough to Pardon
everybody involved
now in the past I've said well not the
not the ones who did violence the ones
who did violence violence is violence
you just have to treat that separately
but now I'm starting to wonder if even
you should pardon them
because at some point it's not about the
it's not about the individuals at some
point it's about
the bigger picture and the bigger
picture is you can't do that
you just can't do that
yes they would be guilty and yes I think
the people did violence should be
punished in a you know just world
but we don't live in a just World
sometimes you live in a world where you
got to make a statement
and
one statement I wouldn't mind seeing
is if you're going to screw the citizens
that badly and then keep it a secret
they're they're all going free
they're just they're just all going free
which would be a terrible travesty to
the victims of their crimes
but I do it anyway because I think
there's a bigger play here
I think I I think this level of
wrongness needs to be met with a large
statement
to at least give us some chance of
remembering not to do it again
so I don't know I think it's walking
directly into the uh Trump re-election
campaign uh
and I think for fake also said he'd be
doing some pardoning so that would give
them some advantage
there's a question
is Biden lying or is this a case of
dementia so in a speech yesterday
probably or over the weekend
he said quote I doubt many people would
have said that two years after being
elected I'd be able to convince India
Australia Japan in the United States to
form an organization called the quad
which you know is to help keep World
stability
uh the GOP did a fact check on that and
said the quad was re-established in 2017
under President Trump
so the question is
does Biden not know that he was lying
is the fact check itself a lie because
it could be that the fact Jack is the
lie or
is it just dementia and he thinks he did
it but it's actually Trump's
accomplishment
although he wouldn't call it an
accomplishment because it's
re-establishing whoever established it
the first time probably gets whatever
credit
but if you're re-establishing it that's
you know a little less of an
accomplishment
all right well
are you disturbed by the fact that we
don't know
you know when when Trump says something
that doesn't pass the fact checking
it doesn't bother me that much
if you've noticed you've probably
noticed that I'm I'm less bothered by
him not passing the fact check than
other people are and the reason is that
he's somewhat transparent about his
hyperbole
right if he told you tomorrow the
problem with windmills is that they
uh they're like airplane propellers and
they might take off
or just something ridiculous you
wouldn't think he had dementia
would you
you think oh he just does that he just
exaggerates
tells you the story puts it into a
visual picture but yeah you know he's
embellishing and it's not meant to be
literal
so that part could bother you but at
least you figure he's in in control of
his faculties with Biden you actually
literally can't tell
I mean genuinely I don't know if he's
lying or genuinely I don't know if this
is just uh dementia
what do you think can you tell is it a
lie or dementia go tell me in the
comments lie or dementia no you can't
say both he could have both but what is
the reason for this
yeah it's it's like evenly split you're
evenly split there in the comments
yeah no both he can he can be both but
only one of them would explain this
right he's either knowingly lying or
he's not that's not a both situation
all right yeah
I don't know but the fact that you can't
tell would be an interesting uh campaign
theme
because people don't like Risk
especially older voters and they're the
ones who vote the most suppose you said
Joe Biden has dementia
and you're a Democrat what's your take
to that Joe bison has dementia they just
deny it right
they might even think it's true and they
still deny it
so just saying he has dementia
it's like any other political attack
it's just sort of weak and obvious and
ordinary but suppose instead you said
this
do you want to have a president where
you genuinely can't tell if he's lying
or if it's dementia
how'd that feel let me say it again just
feel it don't think it don't think it
just feel it
how would you feel having a president
where you genuinely can't tell if he's
lying or it's a product of dementia
yeah that's different isn't it
feel how different that is
because I put it in in the in a choice
as as soon as you accept that it's a
choice
I've made you think past the sale
right you've thought past the sale of
him being ordinary or being okay there's
something wrong so if you accept that
there's something wrong
you either accept that he's a liar which
puts which takes away his biggest
Advantage his own statement his biggest
advantage over Trump
right so he's either a liar or he has
dementia which is way worse than Trump
so he's either as bad as Trump which
takes away his main claim to being
better
or he's worse
and you can make people think right past
the sale to well it's one of those
things it's got to be one of those
things but but seriously it's actually a
real question too
how would you feel if you couldn't tell
he was lying or he had dementia
because the weird thing is we're used to
politicians lying
am I right
we're completely accustomed to
politicians lying and it doesn't bother
us in the same way as if he didn't know
if you know somebody's lying that gives
you some clarity about how to act oh
I'll call them a liar I'll check the
fact checking or vote for the other
person right gives you a very clear
statement of what to do but if you don't
know
if that's Dementia or lying
what do you do
what do you do
it's very confusing if if as a Persuader
and a leader
you're trying to get people to buy into
your message and your message is I'll
give you some certainty
is really helpful to make the voter feel
confused
I don't like being confused
I'd rather the the evil I know than this
big unknown I don't know will he started
nuclear war because he has dementia
I don't know but it's out there it's a
possibility
so
that's what I'd do if I were Trump
I'd go after that question
so the NAACP
has come out with an advisory for black
people
formal travel advisory now I didn't know
that the n a double c and double ACP
gave formal travel advisories but the
news says that they do
and as the news says that they do well
then I guess they do
and their travel advisories for Florida
saying that the state has become quote
hostile to Black Americans under Florida
Governor Ron desantis's leadership
on assuming they go on on a seeming
quest to silence African-American voices
the governor of the state of Florida
has shown that African-Americans are not
welcome in the State of Florida the
travel advisory reads
so you know what happened next right
I mean the world is very predictable
once the NAACP said that black people
should stay away from Florida
they were obviously canceled for being
racist and everybody was disgraced and
we're just about
wait I'm being told that none of that
happened
well that's confusing
well I thought that's what happens I
thought if you advised one group of
Americans to avoid another group of
Americans over racial reasons
well I thought you'd get canceled for
that but
well now I'm all confused about this
story
they didn't get canceled
I mean they just still they told black
people to keep the away from
Florida
and I don't I'm reading between the
lines but I helped me out here was the
NAACP saying that the black Americans
should not go to Florida because there
are black people there
that's not what they were saying right
I believe they were saying that the
black people in Florida would be okay
no danger for them
but the today Joe would come from the
non-black people
sort of the Ron DeSantis looking people
you know what I mean you know wink wink
the people who kind of look like Ron
DeSantis
yeah politicians wink wink leaders wink
wink
we're totally okay with this right
nobody's getting canceled
totally okay with it how is this
different from what I said
do you think I should double down now
would this be a good time to Double Down
I'm already a disgraced cartoonist
you want me to double down don't you
all right here it comes
question number one
if you're a white American
does it make sense to go where there's
high crime
would you be safer in a high crime
neighborhood or a low crime neighborhood
will you be safer in a low-crime
neighborhood wouldn't you
now
would low-income neighborhoods typically
be the ones with high crime
yes or no
yeah a low income neighborhood typically
is going to be higher crime
so if white Americans are looking at
low-income black population areas
would it be riskier
for them to go there in terms of crime
and the answer of course is yes
but not because of race
because low income high crime it would
be a dangerous place whether you're a
black American or a white American or
Asian American or anything else
so we would all agree that staying away
from high crime areas is a good idea
regardless of race right
now
can you name the most dangerous
poor area that is primarily White
can can you just name a couple because I
think this conversation needs some
examples to round out round it out name
some cities or areas where there's a lot
of crime they're noted for their high
crime but they're primarily a white area
can you think of one
I don't know Appalachia
so the thing is with Appalachia there's
not high density
so usually you need high density before
you get to the serious crime yeah well I
don't know of any but let's assume but
let's assume that the real issue there
is income okay
so low income comes with high crime
now what about
so would you say that it makes sense for
white Americans to say stay away from
areas that there's high crime
yes everybody would agree with that
because whether you're white or black
you should stay away from areas where
there's high crime
now what about
if you're a white American
and you're just having the job
and there are a lot of uh let's say it's
a blue collar job let's say you're in
the middle income
you're in the middle income you might
not have a college education but you got
a serious job maybe your union job that
sort of thing if you're if you're a
white person and you work with black
co-workers and black bosses
uh are your odds of being sued for being
a racist higher or lower
than if you're a white person working
with all white people
or I'll even a mix of Asian Americans
and white people
Indian Americans and white people
much higher
we but let's say we perceive it to be
higher
because if a bunch of white people are
working together they never
I Won't Say Never but it would be very
rare for white people
to sue other white people for racial
discrimination
right that'd be sort of a weird
situation so if you're white you have a
higher risk if your co-workers and maybe
your boss are black because you'd have a
risk of discrimination
that you wouldn't have otherwise
but what if you get into the high income
high education group
let's say you're in a college
environment
and you've got a number of colleagues
highly educated
very successful good incomes
are you as safe
in a mixed environment where you're a
white person you've got black colleagues
and white colleagues and Asian American
colleagues and Hispanic colleagues or
would you be safer
if they were all white
or all or a mix of everything except
African-American let's say
well I would say that your reputational
risk of being accused of being a racist
would be the highest in the high
education and high income group
would you agree because it's the the
high education you get the Ibrahim
candies you get the CRT people you get
the people who have been educated
formally educated to think that white
people are the cause of systemic racism
so that's how that's that's how their
education frames their reality
so there are three situations
in which white people have a higher risk
reputationally crime-wise being sued
and it's three different situations but
it's all three income groups among black
Americans
so you would have more danger to go into
a high crime low-income area of any kind
but in the United States we couldn't
even think of one that's mostly White
now that doesn't have to be a racial
reason it's just a correlation but
um
the the same advice holds whether you
were a black man or a white man you
wouldn't want to go into a high crime
area so that makes sense to stay away
from high crime areas regardless of the
racial composition
but you'd agree that within the middle
income you know Middle America
only black people accuse you of being
racist if you're white
so you have much higher risk and and
what is what is the risk if you were a
white person working with black
co-workers what is the what are the odds
that eventually you would be accused of
being a racist
incredibly incredibly accused
pretty high eighty percent maybe so
you'd be guessing
we'd all be guessing and it depends on
the situation no two situations or lying
Etc no people are alike so I'm not you
know just to be clear I'll insert this
in the middle
under all conditions you should judge
individually individual individuals as
individuals does everybody agree with
that
there's nobody who disagrees with that
in 2023 is there that on a one-on-one
basis whether it's for Romance
uh business customer boss
client
under every one of those situations
nobody can win with bigotry or
discrimination against individuals you
can never win because the person you
discriminate against loses and then you
lose access to you know 90 of the talent
and beauty of the country so it's not
good for the person doing the
discriminating it's not good for the
company if they work for a company it's
not good for the victim
it literally has no purpose like even
normal crime has a purpose well at least
the criminal maybe got away with
something right at least the criminal
got off better sometimes
but with regular one-on-one
discrimination of an individual
there's no winner
it doesn't pass the sniff test of being
just a reasonable thing to do
however
those categories are not
comprehensive in other words if you
added together all of your social
patterns they should be based on
individuals only
hiring business the the entire Commerce
world if you add that to your social
situation it doesn't cover every
situation
the one situation that's not covered by
all those judge everybody individually
is your legal and physical risk
when you're managing your physical risk
you're not judging individuals
you're you're judging larger
risks
so if you're a white person
associating with black Americans has
become super risky
in a way that it didn't used to be it
used to be that if you went to a high
crime area again it doesn't matter what
the race is you're in a high crime area
everybody knows that high crime areas
are high risk so that part nobody argues
with
but what's different is the middle class
has been weaponized against white people
and white males especially so if you
were a white male and you had a choice
of working with black co-workers or
white co-workers everything else being
equal
only one of those situations gives you
an 80 chance of being
at least threatened with a lawsuit you
you at least have to worry about the
threat of it
and if you're hanging around with
college educated
high-income mixed group of people you're
far more likely to be accused of being
part of the problem
so you have a reputational risk at the
high end you have a physical risk at the
low end and a lawsuit risk in the middle
so there you have it
and
by the way there's nobody in the world
who argues against what I just said
nobody
there is not a single person who
disagrees with one word of what I just
described
but I did get canceled for it
and by the way I didn't get canceled for
what I said
you know that right it wasn't what I
said
of course
it was that some people thought other
people would be offended so they had a
they had a business risk which they
managed and I've never criticized the
people who canceled me at least in terms
of the business decision
as a business decision they have to do
what they have to do but that's my point
my point was that I lived in a world in
which there was one group of people who
might cancel me
and another group
who might support it
uh and the two of them work together and
I got canceled so that that mostly was a
problem with the public and then the
business people had to just respond to
the public they did what they had to do
all right well you got really quiet
you got real quiet when I did this
did anybody disagree
I don't think I've ever seen so much
agreement at one point
all right
LSB doubling down
um teacher of the year an ex-teacher of
the year in California is uh been
arrested for allegedly having sex with a
16 year old boy
at Yucaipa High School
and
that can we just be honest about this
have we reached a point where we could
actually talk about that honestly
because I've got a free speech and you
don't why is that a crime
now I do agree that maybe she needs to
lose her job
fair enough
can we all can we all agree that you
know in terms of being a teacher that's
a pretty big line to cross right so you
cross that line you can't be a teacher
so I'm okay with that part
but
though you need at least a victim
now I realize that all victimless crimes
you know maybe they still need to be
illegal for the benefit of society
but can we stop pretending that a 16
year old boy
is injured for life
for hitting this teacher I mean not
hitting her but you know what I mean
can we just pretend can we just stop
we just have to stop being this stupid
this is so stupid
yeah get her out of the school
but jail that's just so crazy
so crazy
and by the way I do have a double
standard
so I would not say the same thing if the
genders were reversed you're on the same
page with that right this is totally I'm
not being
I'm not being equal in terms of the
genders this is completely a sexist
opinion but it's one that I'd
you know I'd bet my life on
if you had to Bet Your Life on one
opinion I would bet my life
on this opinion being a good one I bet
my life
yeah there's no there's no wiggle room
on this one
all right
um
so uh a local TV actor Ken Rosado
he got uh got in trouble I think he's
either fired or pulled off the air or
something because I'm a hot mic moment
he referred to his uh
his co-anchor by the c word
the c word
he used the c word and got caught in a
hot mic and it was immediately fired now
here's here's the good news about this
um you know he was a man his co-worker
was a woman and he used the c word and
boom gone but what I like about this
story is that it would have worked the
other way around too
if there's been a Hot Mo Mike moment and
the woman had called her a co-worker a
dick
she would have been fired immediately
and I think we all agree
wait what
oh she wouldn't be
oh she wouldn't be fired for calling her
co-worker a dick
what would be the question that you
would ask if you heard that story
it's a great question that would just
jump to your mind see she called her
co-worker a dick on the air what is
there any question that jumps to mind oh
yes yes you speak it because you had
Tourette's
probably there was some Pure or said
behaviors that collectively
brought her to the point where she would
say that word it was a dick and we would
like to know what those behaviors were
so that we could judge her in context
because certainly this acting out of
context it's very important to know what
was the whole situation so you know
who's really the bad one in this case
so let's read this story uh because
obviously it works that way too so why
did he call her the c word let's see
checking for that part of the story
checking checking checking checking
because that's not in the story
don't you think that's important
I mean
he didn't just use it because it was a
term of endearment
she did something
that a living breathing functioning
human
thought was so bad
that using that word in front of other
people in a in a business setting
felt right
at the moment when he used the word yeah
I'm sure he regrets it now but when he
used the word it felt right and you
don't want to know why
we have no curiosity
about why she may or may not have
allegedly done that would justify that
language
wow okay
all right I was laughing because I saw a
tweet by uh I think a maze
so it's a tweeter who goes by no not
amazed amuse
amuse is it a muse
I think it's abuse anyway
um
it referred to her the story about Obama
being banned from Russia we'll talk
about that but uh just the reference to
Obama
just a description of the story referred
to Obama as disgraced ex-president Obama
disgraced now that made me laugh because
I'm a disgraced cartoonist
and so I actually I had to look up
disgraced
because I I wasn't positive I knew what
it meant
you know it's sort of a not a word to
use that much
so disgrace the definition means you
used to have a good reputation
but then uh usually through your own
actions you have a bad reputation
but I thought about that and I thought
well wait a minute if I'm disgraced
that's a quality of the uh The Observer
not of me
think about it
what makes me disgraced
and my disgrace to myself
in in my own view of myself and my
disgraced not really
[Laughter]
not really never really it never even
occurred to me honestly the the thought
of feeling disgrace has never occurred
to me so it's a condition that exists
outside of me
and outside of Obama as well
so Obama you know just does what Obama
does and other people call him disgraced
I do what I do
and other people call me disgraced
should I care
it's a weird it's a weird insult if
somebody had said of me you
um let's say you don't work hard
that would bother me
because I do work hard
I'll be I'll be like ah you you got your
facts wrong but disgrace is purely is
purely a chemical reaction that's
happening in the brains of other people
how much should I care about the
chemical reaction happening in your
brain
not at all not all so disgrace always
makes me laugh and and
um
I've thought how I would introduce
myself in public should I ever be
invited to appear in public again which
I'm not sure what the odds of that are
but I would I would ask my person to
introduced me to refer to me as
disgraced cartoonist because I love the
fact as a Cartoonist that I had a good
reputation according to somebody else
and that it was destroyed through my own
actions
I I kind of like that
I know I'm supposed to feel bad about it
but I don't
because it just doesn't feel personal
it just doesn't feel like it's about me
it's like watching a story it has no
just doesn't connect with me at all
right
so Russia's banned I guess 500 Americans
for various things including some CNN
hosts who said things they didn't like
and my first question was if they banned
500 Americans
and I know I was on a top 10 Democratic
hit list
how do I find out if I'm on that list
did anybody say the list
because I I read stories about it with
no but with no list
wouldn't the most obvious thing you'd
include in the story a story about a
list you don't put the list
where can I go look up whether I've been
banned from Russia as if I would ever go
to Russia
right if you have my job
which is talking about the news and
talking about the war in Ukraine do you
think I would ever go to Russia
I mean seriously
that would be the most foolish thing I
could ever do in my life I mean my
electronics would be you know
completely corrupted
I mean I wouldn't be able to make a
private phone call
I mean I would just assumed I'd be
watched from the moment I landed you
know anybody was in the news is going to
get a pretty thorough going over if they
go to go to Russia same with China
I've had people ask me if I would visit
China you know sort of as a tourist
to which I say you don't understand
anything
you don't understand anything about the
world if you think I could go to China
are you serious
I also can't go to Mexico you know that
right
there's no way in hell I would take a
vacation in Mexico
given what I talk about in public
too dangerous yeah so
what I'd love to know if I'm on the list
um
so we heard that the
there's some news that says the FBI
was abusing access to a database that
apparently has lots of private
Communications from Americans now I
guess it was the Patriot Act that
allowed them to spy on foreign Nationals
but in the process of spying on the
foreigns if they talk to anybody who is
a citizen they could keep both sides of
the conversation so they had these ways
of capturing
legally capturing information that they
weren't supposed to be looking at unless
it was you know some terrorist reason I
guess but apparently there were a few
instances where the FBI accessed this
data on private data about Americans
when they were not allowed to
so that's pretty bad a few there's a few
let me see how many instances
um
oh only two two I'm sorry no not two it
was uh 28. 28 times the FBI access I'm
sorry I wasn't 28. 287 wow that's a lot
287 times the FBI accessed this private
information hold on it's not 287. no it
was not 287. it was 287
thousand times
it was 287
000 times
they accessed the data they weren't
supposed to access but if you're worried
about that it's okay it's okay calm down
calm down that's right because from the
time that we learned this
until now
the FBI fixed it they they improved
their training and their procedures and
now
now that's sort of uh it's old news you
know nobody's happy about it but there's
no reason to talk about it now it's been
two years the new the new system yeah
it's it's uh yeah yeah nothing to worry
about
even uh Elon Musk was
took note of that
um so yes the FBI has been quite abusive
it seems
now I asked this question if 287
thousand times the FBI have accessed
private data of citizens
do you know what I'm going to ask next
how do I find out if they have access my
data
do you think I've talked to any foreign
Nationals in the last few years
yes I have
yes I have do you think I've talked to
anybody that at least in my imagination
I could imagine that the uh
that Homeland Security would be tracking
yes I have
nobody dangerous you know we're talking
about you know upstanding citizens but
still citizens of other countries
do you think do you think they looked at
my personal data
because I've ever had a conversation
with somebody from another country
probably
and I don't and I can't find that out
can I
if I sued the government could I could I
find out if they looked at my data
I could foia the FBI data
is that a thing I could foil them huh
I could see it if I use a legal process
I wonder if anybody's doing that
because there must be people like me
who could say reasonably oh I have
talked to people from other countries
and that includes some politics
sometimes politics were involved so
yeah well now there's somebody said Tom
Fenton does foia all the time don't you
think Tom Finn by the way Tom if you if
you listen to this don't you think that
Tom Finn should do it for you to find
out if his information has been looked
at
because he would be he would be on the
short list with me
of you know a few hundred people that
you'd expect they would definitely want
to look at if they were doing it for
political reasons so if you assume that
that the thing you're worried about
is that they were doing it for purely
political reasons
I would want to know if they looked at
Tom fadden's personal information
wouldn't you
because don't you think he's had at
least one conversation for somebody who
was a citizen of another country in the
last few years probably
you know most high profile people do we
have international connections
so
that's pretty alarming
uh here's the news from Russia
uh either Russia has totally captured
Bak moot
or as Lewinski says no that didn't
happen
but at least we can go to CNN to confirm
and CNN says we can't confirm either
side
okay so we have no reporting out of back
moot
we have no idea
because it's basically a pile of rubble
at this point
but who cares who controls a pile of
rubble
Adam
uh so it was a whole lot of nothing
happening there
all right here's a little question that
AI helps me with because it's a good
search engine
I saw a opinion piece by CNN's Sanjay
Gupta
and he was talking about how hard it is
and it must be twice as hard for him
so imagine being a doctor
and he's got three teenage daughters
and they all use cell phones of course
and smartphones and as a doctor and
somebody who's really plugged into the
news he knows that smartphone use is not
good for his daughters
wouldn't you say
Shirlene I'm not reading his mind
obviously he writes articles about it
he's very aware of the risk to his
daughters do you think he uh banned
smartphones from his three daughters
because he's a doctor
he's very aware of the risks
so it's easy right
just ban them from your daughters of
course not
of course not because he's like every
other parent in the world
basically just trapped if you if you
didn't let your team have a smartphone
you couldn't live with the team
you couldn't live with them they would
never ever let you off the hook
unless you're like physically abusive or
something so there's no way to win in
this there's no winning play at all
so and of course you know that the
smartphones are associated with a huge
increase in mental health problems among
people
and so I asked myself this question
what is it that these what is it that
the smartphones do
that causes people to have mental health
problems what what's the primary
active ingredient some say addiction I'm
looking for something else they are
dopamine isolation
keep going
attention almost there desire
oxytocin cognitive Warfare social media
peer pressure
all right here's mine
I have I had a hypothesis which I
checked and then you can tell me how I
did my hypothesis is
that mental health we've we've evolved
as a species
so that our mental health has a lot to
do
with how we feel compared to the people
around us
for example
if there were no people around you
would you feel uh social anxiety
well now because there are no other
people
would you feel
jealousy well no because there'd be no
other people
would you feel body image issues
well only if the people around you were
all superstars and you weren't
which is unlikely
so here's what I think I think that the
the humans evolve to compare themselves
to their little tribe the people who
were immediately in their presence and
if you compare yourself to the people
immediately in your personal life how do
you come out
how do you look
if you only compared yourself to the
people you see in person
you look pretty good don't you
oh yeah baby you're looking pretty hot
today
oh yeah I I look handsome compared to
the people I hang out with
sorry
a big insult to the people I hang out
with I guess but
right but if I turn on Instagram I'm the
ugliest person I know
if I look on Twitter people are just
killing it with their great tweets and
their deep research and their smart
articles and they've got sub stacks and
you know they they're killing it
but if I look around the people around
me they're having more normal lives I
feel pretty good about myself
so I used Ai and I asked the following
question how much of mental health
involves comparing yourself to your
peers
right just think of the question how
much of all the mental health
problems there could be are directly
related to comparing yourself to your
peers here's what AI said
depression
anxiety low self-esteem jealousy body
image issues and social isolation
and I feel like that was a partial list
so
the main thing that the phone does is
make you compare yourself to other
people in a in a in a very unhealthy way
and all of these so mental health
problems according to AI these are
directly related to comparing yourself
to the wrong set of comparisons
now have you heard anybody say this
directly I don't know if I'm coming up
with something that's useful or maybe it
was obvious is it obvious to everybody
or did this add something
I can't tell I can't tell if this added
anything to what you already knew
it does add something so
it makes me wonder if there's anything
you could do with that insight
is there anything you could do to keep
the benefits of social media
by but also get rid of the comparison
problem
somehow I don't know
but they would give you something to
work with anyway
all right
um then I would also say what is the
point of life
here's another one if people have a
meaningful life would you say that
they're less likely to have mental
health problems is that fair to say you
have meaning in your life you wake up
you know what to do you know why you're
doing it and you get to work
yeah it's almost one of the best things
you can do for your mental health
if you if you didn't have a smartphone
what would you think is the purpose of
your life
go pre-smartphone what was the purpose
of your life
probably family children
you know take care of yourself so you
can take care of your community right
and and you naturally were focused on
those things why why was your focus just
naturally
on having a family and stuff
because that's what was around you
the things that were immediately around
you were families
right now introduce the smartphone
and all day long you're looking at
single people who are killing it all day
long
single people or married people who
acted like single people right there's a
whole uh
genre of women who often are married who
have Instagram pages that sure look like
they're single if you know what I mean
sure it looks like they're advertising
for another guy
um even though that's they wouldn't say
that's why they're doing it so the
smartphone changes your
um field of relevance your field of
relevance was almost entirely people
with families do you remember when you
grew up if there was an older adult who
was not married
people called it out
right they were they were the outliers
oh yeah this was unmarried that's 40
years old or whatever
but today the unmarried person who's
killing it has got a you know a million
followers on Instagram and it looks like
they're having a good life
and you probably see more of them than
you see in your real life because in
your real life you might have you know
several contacts a day
but on Instagram you can you can scroll
through and see a hundred different
lives and they're all killing it and
they're single
yeah the smartphone's killing you
destroying the country no doubt about it
I have spoken
now
since we don't know if I will still be
here tomorrow
saying the things that get People
canceled all the time oh only because
I'll probably get extra canceled
but it doesn't happen on the weekend did
you know that
if I say something provocative on a
weekend
nothing happens because it's all the
professionals who come to work on Monday
to say hello
who can we take off the chess board
today
oh
here's this person who says something
controversial
so I want to give you an update on my
scheme of
of registering as a Democrat
so I told you that after I got canceled
and I had virtually zero problem with
any conservatives or Republicans it was
entirely Democrats
uh
that I registered as a Democrat because
if the Democrats are going to Brand me
as a racist
I'm going to join their team
and I thought that it would shut up as
some of my critics because I reasoned
that my critics were so shallow that
they never cared what I said they only
cared I was on the other team or they
thought I was in the other team I wasn't
necessarily but so all I had to do was
join their team
and I've I've trotted it out when some
critics come after me on Twitter just to
see what happens you know I get the but
you're the you know you're the racist to
blah blah blah blah blah and then I just
say I'm a registered Democrat
the whole conversation takes a different
yeah then they become curious about that
then suddenly they forget about all
their accusations and now they're just
curious about that
it's actually really effective
now it's a hypnosis trick
the hypnosis trick is a distraction
basically you take them out of their
model and you bring them to another
frame where they don't have a strong an
argument so as soon as I say I just
registered as a Democrat I'm one of you
it just takes them out of their frame
they don't know what to do with it it's
like oh
well
what's that mean
because firstly I have to figure out
what it means and then they have to
figure out if they care then they have
to figure out if I'm really on their
side or not it Just changes the
conversation totally which is what I
wanted it to do
all right
do you think agencies know how we vote
Yes I think they do
I think you could tell how people vote
just by looking at their social media
don't you
so yeah everybody on social media it's
obvious who they vote for or at least
directionally is obvious who they vote
for
would I move to Mars uh only if the
United States continues to fall apart
which is a possibility
all right
um
they could be voting for me
yeah Daniel Penny broke his silence and
said it wasn't about race
did Daniel Penny really need to say it
wasn't about race
why do we even ask that question
I mean I realize that it's it's a good
thing he did like it's good for his
defense Etc but why was that even ever a
question
was the guy that he restrained doing
black stuff did he get restrained for
being black I don't recall that part of
the story I recall he was doing stuff
that people do if they're
dangerous and mentally challenged
I'm pretty sure he took that in person I
don't think he took that a black person
um
still getting compliments good
good
all right for the people who hate him it
is about race that's true but that's not
what he was answering to
did we go to the room does Russia really
say we didn't go to the Moon they don't
really say that do they
is that is that officially what Russia
says or just some Russians say that
I just saw a comment that says Russia
says we didn't go to the Moon
officially they're claiming that
are you saying that Putin has ever said
that
Putin's never said that right that we
didn't go to the Moon there's no way I
would have missed that if that had ever
been a news story I don't know how I
would not know that
yeah I need a source on that
other NASA equivalent did well that
doesn't count
finished my update about being a
registered Democrat well I think I did
so just being a registered Democrat
makes people lose the thread when
they're trying to criticize me because
you realize it's never about the
criticism the criticism is never the
point literally nobody cared about what
I said you know my my so-called rant
literally nobody cared
would you confirm that none of you cared
did you I didn't affect your life
did it right no so the way people act is
based on on whatever political message
they want to send so they use me as a
carrier vehicle if you will I was sort
of a truck that they could carry their
message
but it's not really about the truck
the truck was just any truck
they can put their message in it's never
about the truck
all right
um
is there any story I should have talked
about
you should be seeing the reframe book
um I'm hope I'm thinking August
that would be like a stretch goal
but the editing is nearing a climax
which is a very long tedious process I'm
hard to edit because I
I have sort of a just my flow of
Consciousness is hard to make sure you
get rid of all the overlaps and the
redundancies and stuff so it's pretty
hard for me to no it's too early to
reorder it's not listed on Amazon yet
but probably and if I had to guess
uh
uh it'd be end of June
if things go well end of June Maybe
for a reorder
all right
um
there's something going on in the
comments over on YouTube
somebody named Helena but I don't know
what it is
well thank you Bob
yeah you like my framing of is he lying
or is it dementia that's really strong
that is really strong persuasion oh
speaking of candidates
so my understanding is now that uh RFK
Jr and Jose ramaswamy have both come out
being pretty Pro uh Bitcoin
can you fact check me on that because
there's some big Bitcoin event going and
I think they both had some involvement
in that
so doesn't that really
Bitcoin is sort of that dividing line
between the old school politicians and
the new ones and it's funny that called
RFK a new one he's 69 what 60 what nine
so
but but at least in
um in terms of his mentality
RFK Jr he plays young doesn't he
he actually works for all ages which is
weird I've never seen that before it
might be a Kennedy thing but he seems to
work for a young and old because he's
got sort of young thinking but he's
chronologically senior citizen and he's
in great shape so that that makes him
look young as well
all right well I do love
I just love the the undercard fight for
the presidency because I think the
undercard is all the fun stuff right and
they're the ones with the interesting
ideas right now
all right
um
have I hypnotized you over the last five
years
well one thing I tell you all the time
is that we don't
we don't come up with our own opinions
on politics
your opinions are assigned to you by
your preferred media
if if your preferred media is me
then it would not be any coincidence
that you sometimes quote me or sound
like me because the the thing that
caused you to want to listen to me for
five years
was not because you disagreed with
everything I say so that there should be
the Venn diagram of your opinions in my
opinions should be pretty close
should be here's what I'm shooting for
I've never said this before by the way
I'm shooting for a
60 to 70 percent agreement with my
audience
I think most people are shooting for you
know 99.
because that's where you make the money
right Hannity has the business model
that makes money you say what your
audience wants to hear and you leave it
at that
and you just keep doing it for 25 years
and you live the Hannity lifestyle which
I'll bet is pretty good
I don't know what Hannity's net worth is
but
agree with your audience is a real good
business model CNN does the same thing
but they do it poorly apparently
the reason I go for 60 to 70 percent is
that I don't want you to leave without
value
because that's the sort of a personal
thing it's the same reason I don't like
to take an advance for writing a book
I don't like to get paid before I've
proven
value
if I give you value and then you give me
money for it yay that makes me happy but
if I get paid and then maybe the book
isn't good or it doesn't sell I'm not
happy with that
I mean I know I should be dancing in in
the streets because I got paid for not
doing good work
but I'm not happy with that I can't be
happy at all
so
I don't want I don't want to give I
don't want to do a show where you all
agree with me and then go just nod your
heads afterwards because that would not
that would not be adding value that
might actually be subtracting value
I would rather agree where it makes
sense
and then if we disagree at the very
least you're going to hear the best
argument on the other side
right now that's what I'm shooting for
I'm not saying that my argument will be
the best argument I'm saying what the
the point of it all is that you mostly
agree so that you don't mind spending
time here but when you disagree you're
going to hear a good argument from the
other side that's all whatever you do
with it is up to you but that's that's
the value I'm trying to present
jaleb says in all caps Scotty your
persuasion has never been weaker
and yet you're here aren't you
do you know what the number one rule of
persuasion is
jaleb
attention
and you just can't stop looking at me
and talking to me
and I didn't even know who you were
until just a moment ago
so
jaleb
now that you've learned the first rule
of persuasion and you can see that I'm
totally nailing it with you because you
just can't stop looking at me and
talking about me
I own you right now
so
how would you know
whether I've persuaded you or not
because you think all of your opinions
came from you
none of your opinions came from you
Caleb they all came from other people
and then if you liked them you kept them
so you don't think that I've influenced
you jaleb
I have
because you can't move your mind away
from me right now you're stuck
I've got you locked into a head grip
like a marine on a subway car
I hope it works out for you
all right that's all for now and uh
YouTube I'm gonna say bye for you and
I'll talk to you in the morning bye for
now best live streams
