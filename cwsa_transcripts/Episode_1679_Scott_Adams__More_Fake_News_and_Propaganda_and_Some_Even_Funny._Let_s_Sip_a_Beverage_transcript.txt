[Music]
good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight
of modern civilization
we're not so sure about the ancient
world but i have a feeling
given their lack of modern dentistry
it's probably better to live now than
then
and so that would make this the
highlight of all civilization in all
likelihood can't prove it but
i mean really common sense
would lead you to that conclusion
now
is there anything that you would like
more than the simultaneous sip don't
answer that question i can feel your
answer it's coming to me directly from
your thoughts and the answer is this is
what you need it's what you want and all
you need to participate is a copper
mugler glass attacker chelsea's time to
canteen joke the flash of athletic guide
color with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine
stream of all time
i'm going to open that faucet
you might start to feel your dopamine
start to surge in a little bit and by
the way if i keep telling you it's going
to do that it's going to do that it
really works do you feel it do you feel
the dopamine kicking in go
ah
wow
that was probably the best one of all
time
hold on hold on hold on
there's a party foul
um this is rather distressing i saw in
the comments
i almost hate to say this but somebody
prematurely sipped
would you raise your hand
the premature supper
make yourself known in the comments
i don't mean to embarrass you
and so
i think we should drink to you the
premature sipper
high achiever
high achiever
not only do we sip to you we salute you
for being ahead of it you might even get
in two sips to other people's one good
job to you we sip to you
you know that's what i've come to expect
from
my
audience high achievers
some of you were thinking oh one sip
would be great that would make my day
and then there's somebody out here is
like what if i get
what if i sneak in two sips
twice as good
i salute that thinking
well i just had a weird
situation
in the title i was writing to this live
stream
i tried to write
let us sip a beverage
let us sip a beverage
and then spell check
kicked in and maybe you know i was
actually talking to text
so the talk to text didn't work
perfectly
and instead of a beverage it changed it
to of
oof of beverage
and i looked at it and said and i
thought
lettuce sip of beverage
and i thought
i think it improved it
and then i started to wonder could i
write
shakespeare accidentally
by simply using voice to text and
mumbling a little bit
and then the voice to text would sort of
misinterpret a word here and there and
it would sound exactly like shakespeare
because here's what doesn't sound like
shakespeare
let us sip a beverage
right
you would know you would know
shakespeare didn't write that let us sip
a beverage
no that's not shakespeare but how about
this
let a sip of beverage
right
it's that simple
you could write shakespeare too just
mumble into your voice to text
one of the problems of having an
economics background
as some of you do and and i do
is that sometimes you can see ugly
truths that you wish you couldn't see
because if you know how things work
economically it's almost like you can
see the the gears of
civilization somewhat obvious to you
because follow the money pretty much
always works
but if you don't have a sense of you
know business models and that sort of
thing you might not be able to follow
them as easily
but once that's your filter you know
you've learned economics or business you
just see it everywhere
and
here's my problem with the news
is it possible that the news or the news
business
has ever been real news because
just correct me if i'm wrong
there was a time in our let's say
american history
when the big newspapers were owned by
billionaires
like hearst william randolph hearst
was the first newspaper involved in
actual
accurate news reporting
i don't think it was right
don't we know for a fact historically
that you were seeing the editorial
opinion of
the publisher
and i would assume that every other
publisher was the same
so
if you if you understand economics
you understand that
at some point in history the
you know the concentration of uh
publishing power
certainly was the hands of rich people
and why in the world would they give you
the news straight if they didn't need to
if they could give you a slanted version
of the news and completely get away with
it
there's no penalty
if they could do it why wouldn't they do
it
and the answer is of course they would
do it
and anybody with an economics degree
would understand that
they'll say they can do it
it would be greatly to their advantage
do they do it
yes
of course
but then what about in the let's say the
60s
just to pick an era you know was was
walter cronkite just straight news
in those days was was the news business
more of a you know lost leader at the
networks but they thought it was
their responsibility
you're getting ahead of me in the
comments
or was maybe the cia
and our government
directly involved in brainwashing the
public
for our own good i think they would have
said
to make us more consumers and to
make us uh you know hate hate the
communists and all that stuff
well i don't know if that's economics
predicts it
but can't you predict that if all you
needed to do was
let's say corrupt a few people
that would be easy to do
imagine the cia going to the head of any
news network in the 60s let's say
and they have lunch and the cia guy says
you know
the cia
has many ways to guarantee that you're
very profitable and successful for the
rest of your career
and the head of the network says what
they say yeah you know i can't give you
specific examples but trust me
you're going to see a lot of opportunity
you're going to get a lot of scoops
you're going to have you know access to
the good stuff
basically everything about your life
would be better
if you maybe cooperate with us and
if we tell you to put a slant on
something it's for the good of the
country and if it's for the good of the
country anyway
and it would make money for you
what's to complain about right you're a
patriot
now what publisher would not fall for
that
maybe a few but you have to assume that
that the news business has always been
corrupt
but just for different reasons
and now we have this uh click bait model
in which
the more fake the news the more
profitable
would you agree with that statement
that's not even that's not hyperbole
even a little bit
the more fake the news is
the more you go what
are you kidding me
that really happened and you're like
click click like a monkey getting a
pellet
or a chicken getting a pellet whoever
gets a pellet you know what i mean we
all like pellets
and
so for at least three different reasons
anybody with an economic degree would
say to themselves
i'm pretty sure the news has never been
real
moreover
it never can be
that's the bad news it's never been real
and it never can be
it never can be
what might be different is the influence
from
foreign entities
that part might be different
because they would have more ability to
penetrate
penetrate social media
than they would and fake put fake
stories here they would have more
ability to do that now than they would
have you know co-opting an american
billionaire to print a story that was
good for russia for example that
probably was pretty hard to do
am i real that's a good question
the answer is
no
all right so this brings me to you know
we've talked about the gel man amnesia
where if you're an expert on the story
yourself you know it's fake but if
somebody's not an expert they can't tell
looks pretty good to them
so
you're going to hear a number of stories
about me in the coming
in the coming days
but here's the filter you should put on
it
and by the way this is a filter that i
used successfully the other day
so the other day somebody said to me i
heard that you said
x
now x it doesn't matter what it was
but x was
wow
if somebody had actually said that and
so how this here's how i successfully
made that fake news go away
i said
given everything you know about me
in every interaction you've had with me
do you believe that that's something i
actually said
no no i'm not talking about my ex
no it's
i said is that something that you
actually believe i said
and the moment you put it in that frame
people say oh
no
no
because sometimes if you just say really
really
based on everything you know
that sounds like something that really
happened
right
so
here's uh we're going to use this uh
this filter a little bit right
here comes one there's a viral video
going around of a local tv station
where there was a reporter who was
standing on a intersection this just
this is a brand new thing
standing on an intersection and the
story is about how this intersection
is like the most dangerous intersection
in l.a
a lot of accidents there
as he's talking
behind him
there's a fairly serious uh vehicular
accident
two cars just
just duke it out behind him as he's
talking about this being the most
dangerous place
for a traffic thing
now
is it real
really
really
did that really happen
now it looks real
doesn't it and probably some there's
probably somebody here who saw it so
alive so it probably was real
if i had to bet on it
i would bet it would i'll bet it's real
but
could you be sure
so i'm going to say it's real
in my opinion
in my opinion but it could be wrong but
i think it was real
but here here's the thing i want you to
think about
how easily it could not have been real
am i right
because all it took was a reporter in
the foreground
and then a green screen
and a traffic accident in the background
it would be somewhat easy to think
no i don't think it was faked but think
how easy that would have been
would you have known
if you just saw it on social media
and nobody had vetted it you know it
wasn't like it was on cnn or something i
know i know
[Laughter]
but
you know i suspect it was real
but just keep that in mind that it's
hard to tell
and the really filter won't work every
time but it's pretty darn good now if
you'd like to take a little uh
um
let's say a vacation in the other
reality
so i think i know my live stream
audience pretty well because i've asked
you enough questions to get an idea
about who's watching
if you go over to huffington post
and read what they say about the
pandemic
it's like a whole different reality
and i'm going to give you the two
realities that within i think 24 hours
both of these realities
existed simultaneously
now if you think i'm going to tell you
which one i think is true
you're missing the point
all right i'm going to tell you that
there's two different realities
i don't know which one's true
i honestly don't i can't tell
i mean i have i could guess if you you
know gun to head i i could make a gas
but i can't tell so here's the here's
the huffington post reality
that masks definitely worked and that
the science has proved it and they
linked to a study
i'm not saying the study is good i'm not
saying mass work
i'm just saying what huffington post
says okay
so stay with me
and
um and the distancing works and the
vaccinations worked
and it and then in the huffington post
world
these are unquestionable statements of
fact
that don't require much explanation it's
just context before they tell you
something else
uh in a separate reality
at exactly the same time you know within
24 hours uh
there i just saw a tweet a thread from
dr uh rajiv bali
who's a medical doctor from the uk i
guess
and he talks about a very important
paper published in the landsat now if
you don't know the lancet
is a very
well established
respected publication in science
[Laughter]
[Music]
could you tell i was kidding
there's no such thing as a respected
publication in science
but
if you're going to make a short list of
ones that people say are respected
that would be on the list
so
i'm not going to tell you that because
it's in the landsat that means it's real
because that's not how the world works
i'm just telling you this in the landsat
so i told you what's in the huffington
post i didn't tell you it was real
it's just there
so here's what the headset says
basically i'll summarize the whole
thread
but it would uh purport to say that
you couldn't see any difference in the
country's
uh accent their total mortality
you couldn't see any effect of masks or
policy
the only thing that made a difference
was vaccinations
according to this study again this is
not scott saying it i know you're going
to say
i'm pushing vaccinations that's not what
i'm doing
blah blah blah i'm just saying what is
that so these are completely different
worlds
in one it's now been proven that mass
and distancing and policy made no
difference at all
but vaccinations did
and in the huffington post world at
least they agree on the vaccinations
that part they agree on but in their
world oh those mass totally worked
here's the science
i don't know
i don't know what's going on
all right
here's a trick for predicting the future
if there are two things that could
happen
and people are saying hey
i think things will go this way or it'll
go this way
predict
that will go a third way
whatever that is
because
you're probably going to
be just as likely right as the people
who are saying it's going to go one way
or the other
let me give you an example of this
don't the experts say
that
the only things that could happen in
ukraine
are that the ukrainian
resistance could hold out long enough
that maybe putin would his economy would
get squeezed to the point
where he'd just have to make a deal
that's one thing that could happen i
don't know that many people think that
will work
let me ask you do you think that will
work
you know do you think that's a strategy
first of all do you think it would work
that they could just hold on long enough
that the economic pain
causes putin to
get flexible
we're getting an audio hiccup
it looks on locals is getting a
audio problem
but i can't see that there's anything i
can do about that
um
sorry
well i don't know what to do about that
you can still uh sound as okay over on
youtube so
all right
um i don't have anything
yeah i don't have any bluetooth anything
on
you do
all right
so we'll just be talking to youtube
because we lost the sound on locals i
guess
so here's the here's the question is can
ukraine hold out long enough for the
economic stuff to work
i don't think so
well
let's get rid of this guy
hard user on this
[Music]
channel the trolls are out
the trolls are out
all right
um let me get to my point on ukraine i
think the
the possibility that has been ignored
uh the possibility that's been ignored
is that the ukrainian military could win
and
it's looking more and more like that
might be the case
here's why
let me ask you this question
what number of uh shoulder-mounted
weapons
high-tech american weapons from stingers
to anti-tank weapons
what number of shoulder-mounted weapons
could cause the ukrainian military to
win
is there a
is there is there any kind of situation
and
here's what i think
i believe that in theory there's some
number of shoulder mounted
high-tech stuff
that could cause the ukrainian
resistance to completely destroy
putin's
big equipment
and if they take out the big equipment
and they take out the supply lines
don't they win
am i wrong
and
um
right yeah the experienced hunter
it seems to me
that the ukrainians if they
somehow we still are able to get stuff
into ukraine so as long as we can still
get stuff into ukraine
there should be an endless amount of
shoulder
you know shoulder mounted weaponry
and in theory there's some number of
that
that would cause them to win the war
now how many are we sending and could we
reach that number
somebody says no you still have the air
campaign here's what i'm saying
if if the ukrainians on the ground
um
this is weird i put you in timeout hide
user on this channel
um
but am i crazy
uh am i crazy
to say that if the ukrainians had enough
shoulder-mounted high-tech equipment
they had they had supply chains that are
working
couldn't they win
because even even if russia had air
superiority
uh putin can't afford to lose his army
can he
because i think the uh the actual
russian conscripts would maybe just
surrender
oh the sound is working back on locals
okay
yay
welcome back
i hope on locals some of you went over
to youtube when you when you had
so the point if you missed it on locals
was
i think if the ukrainian resistance had
enough shoulder-mounted rockets
they could win the war outright they
could just win the war
they would need logistics
and
um
let's say targeting
and satellite stuff but i'll bet they
have that help
so if they have satellite and maybe
other kinds of aerial surveillance
if they can communicate
and they know how to use the weapons
because i don't know how hard it is to
train
isn't it just that isn't it just a
question of how many there are
i i'd like i'd like somebody to actually
answer this question
how many are there and how many would it
take to win outright
and if there's somebody who's an expert
who says it can't be done no matter how
many you have
i mean i would listen to that
but i think we've boiled it down to the
number of shoulder mounted weapons
yeah russia can drop vacuum vacuum bombs
anytime it wants to
but
i think if it loses its army on the
ground
they're going to have to make a deal
because what are they going to do
keep bombing and never and never send in
the military to because they have to
conquer it to hold it right
so yes they can do horrible things in
the air but
i think the ukrainians can
actually win the war
all right
people are unusually
bad today
all right so that's enough about that
but i think that's the uh totally
underrated question is what happens if
ukraine actually just wins outright
china is getting more coveted especially
in hong kong
what do you think is going to happen
over there do you think china is going
to successfully
contain
kovid that hasn't yet ravaged the
country
i i'm still i still feel like there's
something we don't understand
and i've never believed that their zero
policy was really why they had such low
infection rate there's just something
unexplained happening over there
maybe we'll find out
um
all right here's here's something that
if you were to google me you would find
you would believe that i said let's
let's put the really filter on this
have i ever done this one before
if you googled me you would see that i
had once
said that all men are rapists
that's what the internet says now do you
believe that
do you do you believe that
think of everything that you've ever
heard me say
and ask yourself
do you think that i would ever make a
sweeping statement
about all kinds all people do a certain
thing
would i ever do that
in fact i might be the least likely
person
who would say all people act alike
you know all people in the category act
alike
that's almost the most opposite of my
brand of anything there could be but on
the internet it says i said it
so it must be true all right here's
another one i'll bet some of you think
this one's true
years ago
if you look on the internet there's a
story that um
though the word okay i remember the word
that i went on to a
bulletin board you know posting site
called meta
meta something
and
and i pretended to be another person
and as a sock puppet
to promote myself
do you believe that happened
and then i got busted
trying to promote myself and calling
myself a genius online
well in all these stories there's always
something like it that happened
but if now that you've been sort of
educated by the last five years of fake
news
and you've seen that every story about a
celebrity is wrong
all of them sometimes the facts are
right but they're so out of context that
they they effectively reverse what it
was
now now that's actually just reported as
a fact
if somebody wrote a biography of my life
that would be written as a
fact but of course
the context is all missing which would
completely change what you thought about
the story
anyway
just keep that in mind alright here's
one
the daily beast oh my god the daily
beast got a scoop
you know you think the daily beast
has some fake news sometimes but not
always
sometimes they nail it and here's a
here's an exclusive that the daily beast
got my god
this is pretty damning
i don't know i i think you're going to
be blown away when you hear this
i'll read the headline it says from the
daily beast russian american national
elena branson was a indicted this week
for lobbying for pro-kremlin policies
while not registered as a foreign agent
she gave to one u.s politician
tulsi gabbard
holy crap this is quite an exclusive are
you telling me
that this russian agent
somehow gave money to uh you know she
was an american citizen by then so it
was legal
but she gave money to one politician
tulsi gabbard who has been accused of
being a little too pro-russian and now
smoking guns smoking gun
how much did she give god
this this story is just my jaw is
dropping
the total amount over multiple donations
wow
59.95
almost 60 dollars total
wow
um can we have a standing ovation for
the daily beast
uh for coming in with this exclusive
this exclusive
that a russian agent gave on multiple
occasions a total of when all of them
are added up
59.95
completely buying tulsi gabbard's
loyalty
and i didn't think she'd go that cheap
i didn't think she'd go that cheap
honestly
i thought tulsi would
be almost 500
if you're gonna buy
a major politician in this country
i did not know you could get one for
less than sixty dollars
it could have been a pandemic special
i i may have missed the special
but i would have expected to pay at
least five hundred dollars for tulsi's
total
loyalty to my country
and now i'm wondering if i were to offer
more could we buy her back
now that she's totally turned
to a russian propagandist
for that
59.95 they don't say if that's
after
how much does tulsi get to keep
yeah i guess it's not taxable so might
keep the whole thing wow
better than i thought
um
so that's in the news
so just when you think all the news is
fake
this one's not fake
this is some real news right here
a real 59
exclusive
well
do you know why the united states
government has decided to extend
the use of mandates of
mass on transportation like airplanes
and buses they're extending it to april
18th
and the reason they gave was
let me see if i can find the reason the
reason is
we in the government are a bunch of
 we don't care about the
public
or the science
and we think that tulsi gabbard has been
purchased for under sixty dollars
wow that's very specific
now here's something i didn't know uh
apparently the fine for refusing to wear
your mask on an airplane is three
thousand dollars
i might be willing to pay that if i
could get them to leave me alone
if i flew first class and this this is a
rich person thing so i yeah i get it i
get it
i get it
but still
you know there are a lot of things that
have to be started by the stupid rich
have you ever heard that
phrase
when i worked for the phone company
that's actually what we call that
segment
we call them the stupid rich
because you could sell overpriced things
to them first and then get the market
going
so so if the stupid rich didn't exist
then the rest of the market wouldn't you
know come along later that's how you
build the market by stupid rich people
so as as a member of the stupid rich
people club
what if i just flew first class to
hawaii just for an example
and i said would anybody mind
if i just
pay the fine
i'll just pay the 3 000 on top of my c
cost
and would you leave me alone for six
hours
what would they say
because they don't arrest you right
if the stated
if the stated penalty
just just bear with me here i'm getting
to a point you're gonna like if the
stated penalty is the three thousand
dollars
and if you agree to it politely say you
know i understand the penalty is three
thousand dollars
if it's okay with you
i don't want to get into any kind of an
encounter or anything because you know i
respect your need to do your job but
would you be okay
just taking my name and finding me the
three thousand dollars if it's okay with
me
now what would happen if enough rich
people
said you know
i'll pay three thousand dollars to not
have a mask for six hours
what happens if first class doesn't have
masks because they all just agreed to
pay the three thousand dollars
because they could afford it if they
wanted to
right
as soon as that happens
there's a revolution right
yeah i can't see any world
uh
i can't see any world in which
the uh
in which the rich could get away with
having no mask in exactly the same
airplane as the other people will have
to wear masks i just don't think it'll
last now the other hand if it's only
going to be another you know month or so
it's not worth the fight
but i wonder
yeah i wonder about these things
uh rasmussen says that uh did a poll and
found that 85 percent of the people say
they're following the ukraine war
closely
do you believe that
do you believe that 85 percent
of the public in the united states
is
is following the ukraine war closely
i don't think so
have you talked to anybody who isn't
watching this live stream lately
i don't know if anybody's following it
closely
all right
here's a question for you if the ukraine
war devolves into a supply chain war
which it might be
it might be devolving into a supply
chain war
who wins
now
there there's a completely reasonable
opinion that russia would win because
they have a border they've got so much
military control and so many
they've got a port i think pretty soon
if they don't have it already so you say
russia right
but
i feel that the further you get you know
toward kiev
the less that's true
and that they've got to have kev or they
don't win
and i feel like the ukrainian student
can just keep cutting off their supply
lines if they have enough
high-tech stuff
and i think that they will
so i think one of the surprises here is
that the supply chain war
might be
might be winnable by the ukrainian
resistance
now
i talk to you all the time about proof
that we're a simulation well i'd say
evidence not proof we can't prove it
but
i do believe that the math suggests
and the likelihood suggests
that we are some kind of simulation
i offer you the following evidence
that you live in the simulation
and it starts with this assumption
the assumption is
that there would be a purpose for
creating a simulation so in other words
we're not randomly created we would be
created for some benefit
for whoever created us
now what benefits would those be
one would be scientific let's say
researchy get some research
find out some information that you can't
find out in the real world because you
don't want to kill real people you'd
rather just simulate it like a simulated
war
right
a war game or a simulated war is how you
find out without actually killing
anybody what's going to happen
so wouldn't you imagine that one of the
most likely reasons a simulation would
be developed
is to test different
scenarios and see what happens
is it a coincidence
that our supply chains in in the world
or global supply chains have been tested
once by the pandemic
once by our trade war with china
and once by a real war now in the
ukraine
back to back to back
is it a coincidence that our supply
chain was the
the central player
in a lot of this
because even the vaccinations
were were a supply chain logistical
problem you know it wasn't just
how how easily you create them is how
easily you get them into people's arms
again
i'm not promoting vaccinations i'm just
talking about stuff
right
yeah and the trucker protest too exactly
the trucker protest was yet another
you could argue that that's the pandemic
though
now
again it's not proof
but every time i see something like
a continued assault on one problem
it makes me think we're we're in a
simulation and p and somebody's seeing
what happens to their supply chain
under a variety of situations
i feel like we're testing it for whoever
created us
weird huh
all right
uh what do you think should we buy
russian oil or stop buying russian oil
if we stop buying it
does that mean that our
prices for domestic oil go up
or don't we just buy it from somebody
else and then somebody else buys it from
russia
do you know what the word fungible means
we people who study economics we like to
use words like that so that we sound
smarter than other people
fungible
fungible just means
you can take there's a thing that you
can take anywhere and use it anywhere
and oil is fungible because it doesn't
matter where you buy it
or where you use it
like it can come from anywhere or it can
go anywhere it could be used anywhere
it's fungible
meaning it can just go anywhere
so
it shouldn't affect our prices that much
if at all
if we stop buying russian oil should it
unless it's the cheapest oil that's ever
been made
wouldn't the only thing that happened is
i know
some other country would buy russia's
oil and then we would buy the oil that
they were buying from somebody else or
something like that
yeah and it's a small percentage so i'm
not sure that
it makes any difference at the gas pump
whether we buy russian oil
so
i think the only difference or the only
point of it is to
demonize putin
it makes a point if the point we're
trying to make with all of the economic
sanctions is that you shouldn't do
business with russia
then we shouldn't do business with
russia
and i don't think the argument that our
will pay more at the pump
kind of doesn't quite track with the
fact that
oil is fungible
it shouldn't make any difference at all
i don't think we'd notice it
and if it made a difference it'd be so
small
thanks john
um
all right
and let me see what do you think of that
bio lab story
everything about the bio lab story looks
like misinformation to me
meaning that
i'm sure both sides are wrong
it seems to be a bull side situation
right
the the once one side says the us was
involved in
i don't know funding or creating
bio labs in ukraine to do dangerous
weaponized stuff
and another story is nothing like that
happened
no there's nothing like that
so which of those is true what do you
think
now both sides are saying that the other
one is just clearly
ignoring the obvious evidence
and
yeah so victoria nuland confirmed
that there are some kind of labs
but that's different than
confirming
the details of such
it's different than confirming
the worst of the the
suspicions um
yeah
i i think this is a fargo war story that
i'm gonna
i'm gonna treat gingerly
i would say that i i don't have an
opinion about what is more real here
but i definitely have a question
which is is it true that ukraine was
being used as basically the
the world's toilet
were we putting our nastiest most
dangerous stuff in ukraine just because
we could
is that what was happening
because
i don't think anybody comes out looking
good in this but
keep in mind that any story that looks
like it's russian propaganda
might be russian propaganda
do you know it sounds exactly like
russian propaganda
that the u.s put bio labs in ukraine
if i were going to write russian
propaganda i would say you know the
united states put dangerous weaponized
bio labs in ukraine
it doesn't mean we didn't do it
i'm just saying
that would be about as on the nose as
you could possibly get
basically
blaming the united states of
something close to your weapon of mass
destruction it would be an accidental
one i guess
yeah i know i i think everyone is lying
about this story
that's my take
everyone's lying
because whatever is the truth
nobody wants you to know it
that part i'm pretty sure there's nobody
who wants you to know the truth
because nobody has an interest in the
truth
if it's innocent somebody wants you to
think it's not if it's not somebody
wants to think you know
all right
um
that ladies and gentlemen
brings us to the conclusion of
the best live stream
that has ever ever happened
and
once again i would like to say that
um
i might have the only
different opinions about ukraine that
you ever hear
they might all be wrong
but i'm trying pretty hard to say
something different
is there is there anybody
is there anybody on the
in the tv punditry world
that drives you crazy because they only
say the talking points
and yet they're still on television
and you're like okay
that is all you did is just repeat the
news you added nothing
oh that's interesting
okay i'm
seeing some
names being suggested here
oh let's talk about uh jesse smullet
um i heard of
i heard a uh
i heard the video of the judge
dressing him down and basically
insulting him for all this
and i don't know what your opinion of
that is
probably if you didn't like jesse's
mullet and everything he did
you thought it was awesome that the
judge really
gave it to him verbally
but
i didn't i didn't have that feeling
i had a feeling that the legal system
did what the legal system did
and that's what it should do which is
decide if there's a penalty decide if
he's guilty it did that
i don't think i want my judge putting
his opinion into the record
i thought that was wholly inappropriate
i think you should be disbarred for that
honestly
now it's all legal and nobody gets
disbarred for that sort of thing so i
realize that's a ridiculous thing to ask
for but in terms of a
standard
i think the standard should be
that if your judge is going to give you
you know it'd be one thing if he had a
one sentence
opinion like i i wouldn't even care if
the judge says you know
i'm glad you got caught because you're a
horrible person
that's fine
but i just don't want to hear a whole
monologue
while we're paying taxes to support this
system i don't need i don't need the
judge's monologue on that
i don't know because you know i'm not
i'm not supporting what jesse smaller
did
i'm just saying that
let's let the punishment be the
punishment it just feels like it feels
like the judge is in creepy territory
when he does that it also makes it i
think it degrades the system too
because it makes it look like he was
biased the whole time
right i mean if if he has that kind of
opinion as soon as the verdict is over
he probably had a little bit of that
opinion while it was going on i don't
want to hear that
i i want to hear
here's the decision
boom
um
all right yeah it cost the city a lot
okay that's all for now and um
i'm pretty
pretty sure you've never had a better
experience at least today and tomorrow
even better
even better
