hey everybody
come on in it's time for a very special
afternoon
bonus coffee or no coffee with scott
adams
and that means you don't need to have a
beverage this time you could just join
in
without any kind of a beverage so it's
kind of special that way
well let me start out by saying
congratulations
president-elect biden according to the
vote
i don't think the vote is uh the
official vote will change too much
but we're going to talk about what might
happen
that might surprise you just maybe
because i like a good a good
story and i'm gonna give you one you
ready for it
so congratulations to president biden
and kamalaris
for hard-fought battle according to our
system you won
and i congratulate you for that um
but is it over oh is it over
that's what we're going to talk about
because there might be something coming
that you don't see and you're going to
want to stick around for that
oh yeah you are going to want to stick
around for that
but the big question is and i've been
seeing people ask this on
social media am i experiencing
cognitive dissonance and i would like to
explore that with you
and you can be the judges because the
nature of cognitive dissonance if i've
told you anything
is that the person who suffers from it
is the only
person who can't tell that they haven't
so the allegation is that i am suffering
right now because of the
election outcome from cognitive
dissonance
and i just won't let go of president
trump's
chances so you be the jury
i would tell you that there are two ways
you could spot this alleged
cognitive dissonance in me and that it
would be invisible to me
by definition because if i could see it
in myself
then i wouldn't have it all right number
one
you would look for a trigger the trigger
would be
something that i had experienced or
observed
that i knew to be true that violated my
sense of myself or this my sense of how
the world
should be did that happen is there
anything that has happened so far
that violated my
view of reality and the answer is
no not even close i thought trump would
win
but was there any any time i thought
that it was somehow an impossibility
that biden would get more votes
one way or another no so in my case
there's nothing that i've observed that
is different from my mental model
i did think that the polling was
terribly
you know wrong and sure enough even
though the result was slightly different
than i thought
the the polls were totally wrong so that
was
accurate in terms of what i expected
and of course anybody could win so i
don't believe i have a trigger
people who got triggered by trump
couldn't believe he could possibly get
elected in this
country it was too horrible to imagine
but i don't have any feeling like that
biden is the most sort of ordinary
politician in the world
it's not the biggest surprise in the
world that the democrats put up a big
fight
and that a lot of votes were cast
now the other thing is if so i would i
would argue that i do not have a trigger
because my world view has not been
violated but
is there evidence that i'm acting
irrationally which would be the
the other tell you kind of need both of
them
you need there to be a trigger something
that obviously violated somebody's
sense of reality but then also that
they're acting irrationally
because of it so i'm going to enter into
the irrational part
are you ready now
those of you who have been watching me
longer have a little better context
for this you know that i'm doing this
for fun
but it could be right and you know that
when i think of
the odds of things happening i don't
think in terms of this will happen
and this can't happen i typically think
in terms of the odds
i think it's a 90 chance this will
happen or
50 chance and i'm going to tell you a
story
of what i think will happen
based on the odds okay so what you
should be looking for
is anywhere where i've estimated the
odds in an irrational way
because if you agree with my estimate of
the odds and each of the
things i'm about to talk about you're
probably going to be pretty close to my
opinion
but if any of my estimates of the odds
are just way off and crazy
well that would suggest maybe i've got a
little bit of
confirmation bias a little bit of
cognitive dissonance going on
and that sort of thing let me let me say
as clearly as possible
it is not my opinion that the only way
that joe biden could have won
is if the as if the vote was faked
that's not the only way he could have
won
he could have also won it's possible
by getting more votes so
i would say that if i if i believe the
only way he could win
was just this one explanation that would
be a little cognitive
dissonancy right you know likewise when
the democrats said the only way trump
could have won
must have been russian interference well
if you thought
it was possible you might be a rational
person
if you thought it was the explanation
that's a little cognitive dissonancy but
if you just thought there were some you
know
chance of it that would be a little bit
different at least all right here are
the odds of
things according to me
and let's see if you disagree with any
of them
number one will anomalies be found
in the vote now when i say anomalies i
don't mean these little anecdotes of
i saw somebody fill some fill out some
ballots or
i saw somebody throw something away or
there was something in the trunk of the
the car of the you of the postal service
guy
i'm not talking about the the little
one-offs somebody saw something
if you added those all together they
probably don't add up too much
and i'm not talking about even
necessarily the stories of the big van
that bill pulls up with
with all the biden votes only because i
suspect that you're going to find out
that
nearly all of those stories are not true
okay
so do i sound crazy so far
when i say that nearly if not
every story that you're hearing in the
in the media about
fraud is either completely untrue
or smallish does that sound crazy
all right so but hold on this gets more
interesting
i swear now i would say there's a 100
chance that anomalies will be found
now would they be scientifically proven
in the long run
or are they things that look like
anomalies but have you know perfectly
good answers
it doesn't matter for the
for the point i'm going to make next it
doesn't matter
if the anomalies are alleged
and not real or alleged and real
because the point i'm going to make is
that it would be enough for political
purposes
for the for the republicans to say hey
can we do an audit let's say a digital
audit
of the entire digital database software
situation just to feel comfortable
that everything went the way it was
supposed to go what are the odds that
republicans will ask for a digital audit
what do you think i think there's a at
least a 90 percent chance because why
wouldn't they
why wouldn't they the democrats asked
for it
the democrats asked well not for a
digital audit but democrats
several times tried to reform the voting
system
and republicans said no i hear because
and again this is just an eye here
because they didn't want
trump's election to look like maybe
there was something wrong with the
voting system
it would make it less credible but now
that's not the situation
because the situation is that at least
officially it looks like
biden has won the presidency so would
would the democrats want to look into
the voting
system with a audit if their person won
of course not right so you would expect
the roles to reverse
because it's politics and you would
expect the republicans to say hey
let's audit this system because it might
change the result
at the same time you would expect
democrats would say
no no let's not audit that system uh
we'll
maybe do some reforms but that's for
later well you know let's not revisit
the past you know biden's the president
that's what you'd expect now here's the
fun part
suppose president trump takes advantage
of
a gift that the democrats gave to him
that he never asked for and here's the
gift
he is the king of of creating an asset
and of nothing in this case he would
just have to recognize
that the that the democrats accidentally
created a gigantic negotiating asset
for him that he didn't even try to get
on his own
and it goes like this democrats believe
he might not want to leave peacefully
right now who created that asset
because he actually has something to
negotiate with now
trump can say i will leave
peacefully but you got to do this one
thing for me
now i'm not telling you yet what that
one thing is
but would you agree that the the
democrats have
essentially brainwashed themselves into
believing it's a real thing
that trump would not leave the white
house
did trump do that i mean he didn't hurt
it
he probably contributed to it but i feel
like the democrats created that asset
out of nothing they created a belief
that was a little bit
crazy in my opinion but they believe it
that he won't leave the white house now
what are the odds that president trump
will not recognize that that asset has
been created and he can use it now
he's going to recognize it that's what
he does
he recognizes a free asset that's a
psychological
construct if he sees it here's what he
could ask for
and tell me if this sounds unreasonable
hey i know the republic really depends
on the
peaceful transfer of power as a patriot
i believe in the peaceful transfer of
power and i certainly want that to
happen
this time but you know what else the
republic requires
to support that peaceful transfer of
power it requires a credible election
and i'm going to ask you just for one
thing an audit
of the digital part of the election
that's all and when that order comes
back and it shows that i lost
or you know even if it changes a little
bit i'm sure i'll still lose
and then i will proceed with the
peaceful transfer of power
now is there anybody in the public i'm
talking to you
voters is there anybody who thinks it's
not a good idea
to audit a digital system is there
anybody
opposed to that democrats raise their
hands
in unison nope we don't want to audit
the system what's that do
that frees the electoral college
electorates to do whatever the hell they
want
because if the ru if the democrats don't
agree
to an audit of the system they're
basically telling you it's not a
credible system
now they might have other reasons for it
and
people some people will believe those
other reasons and they might even be
real
they might have totally factual
reasonable reasons why you can't or
shouldn't
audit the election that just happened
they might
but all it requires is the republican
legislatures
to say wait a minute you're not going to
comply with the most reasonable thing
any american could ever ask for
transparency in an election
what tell me what is a higher what is a
higher
principle my dog is making strange
noises if you hear them
what is a higher principle than
transparency in the election
it's the smallest thing i'm asking for
that's all i want and then you get
everything you want you get a president
biden
a peaceful transfer of power and my
congratulations
so if the democrats play
hardball and say we're not going to
allow an audit
it probably frees up the electoral
college
so that the those close estates could
say you know what
we're going to have to do what the
constitution was designed
to take care of which is have our smart
electors make a decision that could be
independent of the official vote
because we can't certify that the vote
was
credible so maybe we'll just go 50 50.
what would happen if the gop electors in
the electoral college
said in just the just the ones that are
close
they said look we honestly can't tell
who won in our state
because there's a little too much
non-transparency
we're just splitting down the middle
half for biden
half for trump where's that end up
depending on which states i suppose it
could go either way
now let's say instead that the democrats
call is bluff and they say you know
let's do this audit if it's the only way
to get
republicans on board and we want to you
know biden is the unifier
and if you're the unifier and you're
biden and you're a centrist
isn't it a pretty reasonable request
it's a pretty reasonable request
all it would take is for biden himself
to say you know
i want to get past this i want my
presidency to be as
credible and valid as possible so yeah
yeah i realize that a politician might
say no to this
but i'm just going to be regular joe i'm
just going to be
i'm going to level with you no malarkey
if you want to do an audit
go ahead what would happen
suppose the audit starts here's where we
get into some other
odds and see if you agree
or disagree with the odds i'm going to
put on this stuff
so if you've if you've done any uh
googling or you've spent time on youtube
looking at how
our election system works you will be
amazed and appalled when you hear
how the at least the digital part of it
is done
you will learn that it is done not by
our government
but by contracted private companies
private companies you will learn that in
several cases they are not american
companies
what that's right non-american companies
are handling important parts of our uh
counting our votes
and i believe at least one of them's in
spain one of them's and one of them's a
canadian company
etc now that by itself
that's you know that's not the biggest
problem in the world is it
because you would expect that there
would be transparency
but those companies also have
proprietary
systems proprietary software and so they
have never been audited
because nobody else can see their stuff
this is my understanding anyway
so let me ask you this what are the odds
that these digital systems that support
the vote what are the odds that they're
hackable
we'll talk about whether they have been
hacked separately
but just the question of is it possible
to hack them
such that the vote could be changed in a
database or as it's happening
without anybody knowing how many of you
think
it's impossible raise your hands
all right let me tell you a little bit
about hacking i'm no expert but
sometimes it helps that you've got a
little bit of a skill stack where you've
been around it
so i've been around a lot of software
development including
including my own companies and
one thing i can tell you for sure is
that most systems have at least some
weakness that could be hacked
that's generally true and probably these
two
but you don't even need to have a
digital way to hack it
that's not the way it's done for the big
stuff for the big stuff
such as throwing an election you bribe
an insider or blackmail them
how hard is it to bribe an insider to
get a change made in
any company turns out it's really easy
and there's plenty of evidence that has
happened in other big companies
they just find the person who's in
charge of it they're
maybe they're earning two hundred
thousand dollars a year
how would they like a million a lot of
people will take a million dollars to
flip a bit so if you say it can't be
hacked
that would only be because you don't
understand enough about the world
either the technology could be directly
hacked in some cases
even if it's hard but remember the
people who would be trying to hack it
would be governments we're not talking
about
a kid in the basement as good as that
kid in the basement might be at hacking
we're talking about the best hackers
who have ever existed on earth in each
of the major countries
probably every one of them took a run at
it right
so is it hackable i'd say the odds of
that are 100
is there anybody who disagrees with that
estimate of the odds
that just as a general concept it is a
hundred percent hackable
even if the hack involves bribing an
insider to do it
okay then the second chance is
um what are the odds that somebody did
succeed in hacking it
all right because that's a separate set
of odds i would say the odds that
somebody will eventually hack it
because it is hackable and the
you know the the upside gain of hacking
is so gigantic i mean it's billions or
trillions of dollars
the people would keep hammering at it
until they succeeded
so you'd presumably the intelligence
services of each of the major countries
would try to get an insider here or try
to get somebody close to the insiders or
try to get their own person on that job
or
try to hack it and they would just keep
hacking and hacking away
and eventually i would say the odds of
somebody hacking it
whoever could be domestic could be
foreign
but if you wait long enough the odds are
a hundred percent
because it's hackable guaranteed
they have the the highest incentive in
the world
to hack it and they wouldn't stop trying
nothing would stop them so eventually
they'll get it so the real question is
has it happened yet
it kind of comes down to that doesn't it
that's all it comes down to
because there's a 100 chance it will
happen
we just don't know if it happened yet
so given what i've just explained
do you think that the electoral college
electors
would feel complete confidence in the
system
if it were not um if it were not audited
given what you just heard do you think
an audited
an audit is just pretty much required
i do even if it doesn't change this
election don't you think they should
plug those holes and audit the heck out
of that thing
yeah even if it has nothing to do with
trump
nothing to do with biden what's more
important than this
what what else are you doing that's
important so
here's here's the weird strange
path that trump still has and
the summary of it is if you can create
enough doubt
and it doesn't look like that would be
hard to create that doubt
you could free the electoral the
electoral college
in a way that's never happened before do
you remember when uh chuck schumer said
uh everything's on the table now
everything's on the table now
well this is on the table if the
republicans decide to
fight with the same you know no holds
barred
chuck schumer thing they can without
violating any laws
the constitution gives them complete
freedom
to express as much doubt as they want
about the integrity of the election
system
so for those of you just joining let me
uh
let me frame this a little bit um
i'm not i'm not that you know that
japanese soldier
who's been on the island for 45 years
and doesn't know the war is over
i know what the vote was
i i know that that biden is going to get
more votes
in this you know this uh the election
so we know that and i accept that
according to our
system this is the time
when it is perfectly appropriate to
congratulate the winner
and try to you know get past any bad
feelings
it is nonetheless true that there's
still a path for
trump but i think you can also say
our system did what our system did we
got a result
we can probably live with it if we have
to
even if he didn't like it
somebody says no way we don't think
biden even had the popular vote
well um wouldn't you like it to have an
audit
now i don't know if a recount gets you
what you want
i don't know but if i were going to do
an audit
here is how i would do it and this is
just one example
and somebody who knows more about
databases than i do can answer this
is each transaction or or change to the
database
logged in some way would it be possible
to see the time
and the amount and some kind of a log of
everything that ever changed
in the vote does anybody know
is that a thing because i can imagine it
could be a thing i just don't know if
it's
you know if it's architected in a way we
could retrieve that
but let's say it's a thing let's say
there is the log of every change to the
database and it could be audited
here's what i would look for i would
look for situations in which
an exact amount of numbers was
subtracted from one column and added to
the other column and the same amount
at the same time because
there's a good chance that whoever if
somebody hacked it
there would be a good chance that they
would be dumb enough to do the switch
simultaneously
or maybe they'd have to because it'd be
discovered otherwise
and so all you'd have to do is find any
times where a big number
is exactly the same as you know a
subtraction and an addition at the same
time
now i don't even know if there should be
subtractions maybe if you find any
subtractions
i should tell you something too now i'm
not suggesting that that's exactly how
you would
find a problem i'm suggesting that
if you put enough attention into it the
odds of finding
something there are pretty good now
just so you know i'm not crazy and as my
final defense for not having cognitive
dissonance
is it not completely possible that if it
got audited
they would find that the only people who
hacked it were republicans
but they didn't hack it enough or you
know because you can't rule out the
possibility
that the system was rigged by some
republican who was just a good hacker
or republican friendly and they didn't
hack it enough
and biden just legitimately got a lot of
votes and it was more than the hack
can't rule that out right and if you're
not willing to be able to say that
as easily as i said it well you might be
in cognitive dissonance or denial
but don't be in any of those things the
country will be fine
and if you're worried about your taxes
they might go up
but probably not as much as baiden wants
to and here's why
it goes like this are you ready jake
tapper doesn't want his taxes raised
i use jake tapper as my example
of a media person who has a high income
who i'm guessing doesn't want to play
pay you know 65 or 70 percent of his
income in taxes probably doesn't so
i would think that the messaging on that
from all of the
rich media people will be a little less
supportive of that tax increase than
maybe what you thought when it was just
a campaign so maybe your taxes won't go
up under biden
as much as you know with the worst case
scenario
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
