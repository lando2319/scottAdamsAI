to the best damn thing that ever
happened to you it's called coffee with
scott adams
and not only is it the best thing that's
ever happened to you
but amazingly it gets better every time
yeah
it's surprising and if you want to take
it up another level all you need is a
copper mug or a glass a tinker gel is a
sign a canteen jug of flesh a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine to the day the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it do its magic now go
you're right i should have said beverage
not liquid
beverage
i appreciate the correction
well happy
mlk day
is everybody celebrating martin luther
king day in some
appropriate fashion
which would be
don't really know
maybe sleep extra so that you two can
have a dream
i don't know exactly what is the
traditional way to celebrate the holiday
but
maybe you do
rasmussen asked this question
appropriate to the day
do you believe that men and women of all
races have equal opportunity which of
course was martin luther king's dream
how many people do you think in the
rasmussen poll
agree that men and women at this moment
have equal opportunity
the answer is about a third
34
and i said to myself
what country are they living in
how in the world do one-third of the
country
think that we've solved uh that we have
equal opportunity
we're not even really close are we
if you if you talk to uh
you know
any black person that asks the question
do you have equal opportunity i'm pretty
sure they could give you some solid
examples of no
don't you think
now there are plenty of places where
things do work out and plenty of places
where it's actually an advantage say a
fortune 500 company might be actively
recruiting
minorities women lgbtq
so there are pockets of inequality
pretty much everywhere
so to imagine that there's equal
opportunity
i think is
weird
because there are clear places where
even white people are being
discriminated against
specifically the biden administration
saying that if you're white you might go
to the the back of the line for
therapeutics and vaccines
now um
yeah and as i said there would be a long
list of uh things that every minority
would say well here's our list and there
would be a lot on that list that's true
you'd agree with it
but here's i think the most productive
way to look at it
equality isn't something you could ever
achieve because nobody will agree what
it looks like
nobody knows what quality or what
equality looks like
we just argue about it it's a little bit
subjective
but here's here's a better frame
uh does do people have
equality of strategies
opportunity
feels like
we both have the same opportunity for
the same job for example
but i think equality of strategy makes
more sense
in other words can i find a strategy
that would leverage the fact
that i'm a white guy
probably i could probably find a way in
the united states to take advantage of
the fact that i'm a white guy
but if i were black
could i also find a strategy a different
strategy
that would give me an edge
for being black and the answer is yes
about women
yes lbgtq yes
yes so there's definitely um
a strategy
that's available for everybody it's a
different strategy though and maybe you
could argue they're not
quite as
awesome
um
one thousand dollar life i don't even
know what that means
weird comments today
anyway uh it's weird that people think
that we have equality we will never have
that but we certainly could have equal
strategies or at least strategies that
are good enough
[Music]
now here's a shocker
i don't know if many of you know this
this might be the first time you're
hearing it
but bernie sanders is not good at
economics
i know
i know i was surprised too but uh as
michael schellenberger points out
uh that
uh bernie sanders and
you know bill mckibben separately maybe
collectively
convinced new englanders that they
didn't need nuclear natural gas
and so now the region is getting 25 of
its electricity
by burning oil
and desperately importing liquefied
natural gas from the
caribbean by ship
now the problem of course is they're
having a cold snap
so
the problem with
a lot of the green energy sources with
the exception of nuclear which is green
is that the other ones are
not consistent they don't
you know they don't tell you exactly
what they're going to give you and when
and
so another example where bernie sanders
is amazingly
not good at economics
i know
i know
i i thought i'd start with the shocking
stuff
um
richard grinnell had an interesting
observation in the
dogs not barking category
and he tweeted this he said the
intelligence leaks the intelligence
leaks have stopped
have they
when was the last time you heard a story
about an intelligence leak
or
a white house insider
it completely stopped didn't it
i i can't think of any stories like that
and then he goes on he says and it
actually points to the partisan
credibility problem of the leakers
it does
and their allies in the media
he says remember when they return and
they will return they are domestic
enemies
well
you know i don't like that framing of
domestic enemy
uh because you know i get framed that
way as well
but
um
this observation is quite on point
suddenly
suddenly people don't leak
boy anything you wondered about the uh
you know the the deep state
i feel like it's answered by this alone
because the leaks are so damaging and if
it only happens to one party
you know that does tell you something
about who's running stuff
all right um
how many of you saw jordan peterson uh
interviewing brett uh weinstein and
heather uh
was it uh heather hair
on evolution
i would recommend it highly
it's like one of the most fast
am i pronouncing it right i was doing it
for memory
give me the proper pronunciation because
i know i'm getting getting both of their
names wrong
haying
haying okay
and his first name is heather
right
all right apologies to
all people whose names i say wrong
um
but i gotta say
that when you see jordan peterson and
brett and it is heather right
um
when you see them talking at
the level that they can talk about smart
stuff
it is actually just
it's kind of thrilling actually
and
i don't know if you'll have this exactly
the same uh
yeah i don't think i don't know if
you'll have exactly the same experience
but
um
there are two things that are remarkable
about all three of the participants
one is that they have deep knowledge of
their subject matter
but the other is that
you will not find better communicators
oh my god
because you know you've got the
university professor experience on top
of the subject matter
oh my god
can they form sentences on the fly
uh to to watch them put together a
coherent form of sentence let's say
a coherent structure of sentences
to give a complete answer to something
without a wasted word
it's
it's like
amazing
you know just as a writer i i couldn't
get over just how their their verbal
capability is just so stellar but on top
of that
they were talking about a missing part
in evolution i'm going to do a bad job
of explaining what they explained
but it does look like there might be
something closer to
intention
this is my own interpretation not theirs
something closer to intention that's
driving
um
evolution now one way that that
intention could be expressed
is in sexual preference as in
i'll make up my own example here so
don't don't blame them for anything i
say about it but
suppose you had a
giraffe who wanted to get to the taller
leaves
but it couldn't reach
with that giraffe if it were female
would the female giraffe look for a
mate with a taller neck
because the giraffe's intention
is to get up to those leaves but it
can't do it directly so does that just
get expressed in its sexual preference
and then future generations could reach
the leaves
no no i mean that's again this is not
coming directly
from
the experts i'm putting my
own sort of speculation into the mix
but what there does seem to be some
mystery about what's driving things and
i think that's
pretty pretty fascinating
all right february one is coming up only
two weeks feb 1 the public is done
that's the date that
we would love
for everybody to be free of masks now
usually when i say that i get a bunch of
people pouring in and say scott scott
scott
i've been done for a long time
i've not worn a mask in a long time and
if you cowards are still wearing masks
well that's on you
just don't get don't bring me into this
i stopped a long time ago to which i say
i don't think you live in my state
because you're not buying groceries
without your mask in my state
now you could try
but you're not going to get any
groceries that way
so i've got a feeling that all the brave
people who have bucked the system live
in states or local locals where they
didn't have any masks
but they bravely they bravely went where
they didn't need to have masks without
masks and i i salute you
but for those of us who are still in
oppressed regions and just trying to get
along until it's over
let me give you a report from my idiot
uh part of the country now i have to
admit
i do normally go through life thinking
that the people i live around
because i'm in the bay area silicon
valley
very high education levels here very
high education levels and i tend to
think that
the people around me are just a little
smarter than the average
i guess i'm biased by the jobs they have
and
the kinds of educations they have
however i'm here to report
that as of uh
the middle of january in 2022
something like half of my idiot
uh community
is wearing masks outdoors alone
in 2022
in mid-january
outdoors
alone
masks on about half of the idiot
public
i
it's just amazing
now
there are at least two things going on
one is you can get used to anything
you know i talk about this all the time
even things that are outrageous at first
you can
sort of just get used to them
which is not good you can get used to
things that are not good for you
and i feel like a lot of people just
don't even notice anymore
you know they leave the store or they
leave their house or whatever maybe they
had a reason to put it on the first
place
i feel like people just forget because i
have
i've actually just forgotten you know
like i'll walk from the supermarket to
my car
and i'll keep my mask on for another
five minutes while i'm unloading the
groceries
and it's not because
i'm in danger
i just i literally just forgot yeah
sometimes because it's cold
if you put your mask on when it's cold
it actually really helps
and so i've actually left my mask on if
i went outdoors and it was cold like oh
this mask is kind of helping but then
there's also the i think it's the social
signaling mostly
don't you
i think it's just social signaling
i don't think they're really afraid
but i don't know
maybe the brainwashing is and the fear
is so bad that they're actually afraid
outdoors
i don't know
you know people i think people got
spooked by the omicron like it can go
everywhere it'll get ya
well here's one observation the local
businesses are largely done with
mask mandates
is that true where you live
if you're a chain business you got to do
what corporate tells you and they're
still going to enforce it if i go into
the safe way they're going to enforce
masks but if you go into a
local owned business
who's telling you to put a mask on
anybody
[Laughter]
because all the local owned businesses
have people not wearing masks
with people who are
but
i've never seen a local business tell
somebody to put a mask on a view
i don't think i would
i don't think i will ever see a local
business do that
so if you're a local gym or you're a
local restaurant here it's
it's kind of optional at this point
so um the chains will be the hard ones
now my estimate is it would only take 10
percent non-compliance on masks to end
it wherever there are still mandates
would you agree with that estimate
if 10 of people just walked into
wherever you have to have a mask
without one
and just politely said oh oh okay you're
going to require me to get a mask but
make them come and talk to you
just be polite
and say oh i'll come back another time
when you don't require it
or
we'll say oh
i've got a mask in my pocket i'll put it
on
but just give them a little bit of
friction
if ten percent of their customers
consistently went maskless how soon
before the staff would give up
about an hour
it'd take about an hour
they would give up right away because
they got work to do right it's the last
thing they care about
let me ask you this
do you know anybody who masks at home
within their own house
do you know anybody who does that
i can't think of anybody who masks at
home i mean in the beginning of the
pandemic
you know service people would mask
but if somebody comes at my house that's
the first thing i tell them is you know
they're welcome to take off their mask
and that's been for a long time
and and how about your kids
are you are you kids not mixing with
other
kids after school
on weekends
and all those kids wearing masks at
their sleepovers
there's no masking going on unless
you're being watched
the public has completely stopped
masking
unless they're being watched
as soon as you get behind closed doors
the mask
gets ripped right off at least that's
the way it is here
now you there may be some masks places
that's different
all right
um
here are a couple of persuasion lessons
number one
debunks always sound more
persuasive than the original claim
would you all agree with that
if you if you're not an expert yourself
and so you hear somebody make a claim
but you really can't evaluate it you're
not an expert or you don't have the
information
and then you hear the debunk
doesn't the debunk
usually sound better than the claim
yeah not always right is this is a
usually situation but in terms of bias
you know not certainty but just in terms
of bias so i'm definitely not telling
you to believe all the debunks but
here's the problem
have you ever seen a debunk get debunked
and i think you have right
what happens when the debunk gets
debunked
does that make the first debunk
actually look weaker
than the new debunk is it turtles all
the way down
can you keep debunking the debunk and
then debunking the debunk of the debunk
forever and that the last thing you say
will be the most convincing
yes
turns out that's exactly what you can do
and the reason and that's probably the
the big reason
that in a jury trial
the defense
the defense gets to go last right
because it's just so well understood
that whoever goes last is going to have
an advantage in the same way that a
first impression is sticky
the last thing that somebody tells you
can be pretty sticky too so to make it
fair for the defendants the defense
always gets to go last
so when we're looking at these claims of
of anything in science or about the
pandemic or whatever you've got the
problem that the claim sounds good
on its surface
but then the debunk
well that sounds pretty good
but then the debunk of the debunk and
let me give you an example can we agree
i'd like to stipulate
would you well i guess i'm gonna have to
make my case
a number of people
were accusing me
of being in the pocket of big pharma
do you think i'm in the pocket of big
pharma
i you know i've disclosed my investments
but i suppose i haven't done it in
writing so you know maybe you could
doubt it so the only big pharma stock
that i've owned
was regeneron
and that was just for a few months and i
took my gains and got out so i've never
owned any of the vaccination companies
except as a component of an index fund
so it's you know a passive kind of
well not passive but it's just an in the
soup if you will
so
so i don't have you know any kind of
direct thing and nobody's paying me to
do it blah blah and also my business
model
rewards me for being wrong
as well as being right
if if i can teach you something by being
wrong it'd be good content so i really
don't have the incentive
to
lie or be biased that some people would
now that doesn't make me unbiased right
doesn't work that way so everybody's got
some bias i just don't have any of the
obvious ones
my bias is maybe consistency everybody
has a consistency bias everybody has an
ego bias
we all want to be right even though my
business model would reward me either
way
so
um
so let me i'm going to talk about the
topic that you love to hear about but i
don't care about the truth of it
i'm going to talk about the
how we how we process it right and the
topic is ivermectin but let me tell you
i don't care if it works
like i really care
how we figure out if it works
and i'm going to add something to what
you've heard before
but i'm not here to argue whether it
works
because i don't think it makes any
difference
same with masks
i'm way past
it'd be useful to argue whether they
work
because they're just going to go away
and you know i'm not worried about dying
of
of
of covet
so could we
i don't know if you can
come with me on this journey but i don't
want to talk about whether it works i
only want to talk about how we processed
it you know the knowledge and here's my
take on it
a little background first of all the
more skeptical you are the more gullible
you appear
to those who are less skeptical
that doesn't sound
immediately obvious why that's true
right
so my claim is that against all common
sense
that the most skeptical person
will appear to be the most gullible
to people who are less skeptical
now you'll need an example of that right
because that doesn't make sense on the
surface
all right here's an example um
i would say that you you the audience
correct me if i'm wrong would not trust
big pharma are we same page
i don't trust big pharma
you don't trust big pharma now
do you distrust them more than i do
well i would say that big pharma would
kill people
for money
and even maybe millions of people for
money
do you think you trust them less than
that
i think we all agree
that they would kill millions of people
for money
okay so am i so far on the same page
that on just that question
we're
roughly equally skeptical
right
i don't i don't believe what this the
big pharma tells us i don't believe any
of the data
i don't believe they have our interests
in mind and i do believe that they would
kill millions of people if they could
make a profit
you know they would they would persuade
themselves that they weren't really
doing that you know so easily could
happen
now
i would go one level deeper in my
skepticism than that
do you believe
that big pharma
which would be let's say typical of a
big company
there's no reason to believe that pharma
would be more efficient or better
managed
than any well-managed company in any
other industry
how many of you believe that big pharma
could exert so much control over
messaging and reality
that they could make something such as
ivermectin
disappear
from use almost completely
and
and coerce the entire
technical community
to disappear it
now here's an argument how that could
easily happen
if pharma only got to american
experts then other countries would
probably fall in line
because they they did take the lead from
america and a lot of stuff
so that makes sense
and it's also true that they could bribe
just a few people just a few experts
and that would be enough to convince the
other american experts who would just
parrot what the the first expert said
and then that would be enough to spread
everywhere
and then they could work with their
their vassals in social media and then
the news
and that if somebody did say hey i think
they're lying to us they could get
squashed down by
they could be disappeared by the
algorithms
and then the news would just not talk
about you know the alternative points of
view
so
would we would we be on the same page
skeptically
that big pharma would have all of those
tools available
they could control social media they
could control the news
they could control enough experts
to control american experts
to control
international experts
who would disagree with that
nobody right
now am i just as skeptical as you are so
far we're not done yet
but what we've talked about so far are
we equally skeptical
i think we are
all right
let me take you a little bit deeper
do you believe that a big entity like
that which would no doubt have many
witnesses to such a crime
a crime that would be in size
roughly the size of the holocaust
so if big pharma were suppressing
a
a cheap available cure
how big would the crime be i would say
roughly the size of the holocaust
let's say the holocaust is 6 million
souls
5 million have died from
covid so far
and if you imagine that it might have
taken some ramp up if ivecton or
something else worked
but there'll still be more deaths
let's say something in the neighborhood
of the holocaust
would be the size of the crime would you
agree with that so far
that now this is i'm not saying this is
true
i'm saying that if
there were this global conspiracy it
would be holocaust sized
do you believe
that there's nobody smart enough or
dumb enough
who would be aware of this evil who
wouldn't try to monetize it
because i don't
i'm a little more skeptical than you are
about this
i don't believe a company could be so
efficient
because remember i created the dilbert
comic
based on the observation the companies
are a hot mess
they can look efficient from the outside
but not on the inside
on the inside every company is a hot
mess
i will confirm that by every single
person who worked at any big company
there will be no disagreement of that
statement every big company is a hot
mess on the inside
now do you believe that in that soup of
different personalities
and hot mess you could not produce by
now
because some time has gone by
by now
you don't think that somebody who would
be aware of this
great ivermectin
conspiracy
you don't think even one of them would
have found a way to monetize their
knowledge
let me tell you how
go to my publisher
if anybody has that secret knowledge
go to my publisher or any major
publisher
and say i actually do have the inside
story
and i can prove it
that we suppressed divermecton while
knowing it worked
book deal
millions
millions
how about going on joe rogan's podcast
do you think joe rogan would book you as
a guest
if you had worked for one of the big
vaccine companies and you said you know
i was actually in the room
or merck or somebody else i was in the
room
and they did say we're going to hide
this thing and we do know it works but
we can make more money the other way
do you think joe rogan would book that
guest
of course
do you think i would talk about it
of course
do you think
tim poole would talk about it
of course do you think any of the three
people i mentioned are on the take
nope
i doubt it
i don't think so
i mean i'd be real surprised i'm pretty
sure i know myself so that's one out of
three
and i'd be real surprised about the
other two
so you you have an easy path for
somebody to become a savior
let me ask you this
of course you're worried about being
destroyed by big pharma right
if somebody if somebody came forward
you would be destroyed by big pharma
would you do it anyway
i would
you wouldn't do it all right would you
be so afraid of big pharma that you
wouldn't save millions of lives
be the hero of the pandemic
and make millions in speaking fees and
book deals
really now somebody mentioned uh
oxycontin
and how long their let's say their
bad behavior
went on
i would argue that they got to hide
because they did not have as much
scrutiny
if you're just another company with
another product
you can hide pretty well because you
don't have a lot of eyeballs on you but
and and the deaths would be in the ones
and twos and it would be hard to sum up
the deaths like it was hard to notice
that oxycontin was killing so many
people because nobody was keeping the
stats
but
can you imagine a holocaust sized crime
when everybody's looking for that exact
crime
so not only would do we know exactly who
the perpetrators would be
it would be the big pharma companies
but the entire world and all the experts
in it are looking at it and we're
looking at their data
under those conditions
do you think that any company could be
competent enough
to hide a
holocaust-sized crime
when
well let me ask this question i'll ask
you directly in the comments if you were
in the position to be the whistleblower
but the only downside is that the big
pharma would come after you
would you blow the whistle go
would you blow the whistle
or would you be afraid and let millions
of people die
you'd expect some people to say no i
wouldn't
and that's actually pretty reasonable in
terms of self-interest
i wouldn't criticize that at all but the
truth is humans are all over the map and
if you have enough witnesses you get
everything right
if you have enough witnesses you get
every outcome people who don't want to
talk people who do want to talk
so i think enough time has gone by
that i'm very skeptical any big company
could be this
ruthlessly efficient
without
and imagine they could get away with it
because remember the lesson of the
oxycontin story
is that they got caught
the lesson isn't that you could get away
with it forever
the lesson is best case scenario you can
get away with it temporarily
don't you think that if any executives
actually did what this accusation is
they would be killed
now when i say they would be killed i
don't mean they would be executed by the
state
i mean they would be treated um the way
a nazi
holocaust
prison guard would be treated
when the camp was liberated if you know
what i mean
i don't think they went on trial
if you know what i mean i think the
public would actually kill them
that so the risk of the
of the big pharma executives should they
have been involved in a holocaust size
crime which is exactly the accusation
that's the accusation that they were
involved in a holocaust-sized crime
we would kill them
am i right
the only way they could ever not be
killed by the public is if the legal
system
protected them first and you got them
into some kind of protective custody the
moment the public found out and we would
eventually
right there's no way you could hide this
crime for five years
10 years do you think
do you think this kind of crime could be
hidden for 10 years
i mean even though the oxycontin was
because nobody was looking for that
crime
somebody says yes
yes in the sense that it's possible but
no but with so much attention on this
topic i don't think it is
so
so i would say i'm more skeptical than
you on the
um
efficiency of big companies
but it's a subject it's a subjective
right you would say no no scott
i'm more skeptical than you
because i think they're so evil
but do you believe they're so efficient
i don't know that you do do you
really
really you think they're that efficient
i i believe that the people who have
worked for large companies would say no
oh actually let me do it let me do a
quick bowl
if i may
could we agree just for the you know the
collective entertainment of all of us
just the people who have experience in
large companies
do large companies have the skill to
pull off this size of a
holocaust crime
and get away with it in perpetuity
just the people who work for big
companies i see a wall of no's they are
not capable of doing it
right so if you don't have big company
experience look to the people who do
all right doesn't mean they're right i
mean that's not confirmation of anything
but i would take them seriously because
it's sort of a
you know a lot of people saying now that
that they're not that competent
and i would remember the
the difference is that everybody's
looking
if nobody's looking for the crime then
they they're all that competent any any
big company can get away with a crime
that nobody's looking for
all right
i came up with a new way to to describe
this thing i call it binary syndrome
which is where people who have opinions
that don't fit the two teams
they
they get to snap to guide
have you ever used software that has a
menu choice
called snap to guide
it means you you take an object you're
moving on your screen
you get it near a guideline and it goes
you know it just snaps to it so you
don't have to figure out exactly whether
it's lining up it just snaps to the
guide you put there
well that's what it feels like when
people see my opinions
if they if they can sniff
that my opinion has any kind of a sense
of leaning in one direction they snap to
guide
and then and then they're done
that's that's their entire thinking
process
snapped a guide
and so the binaries it creates that
binary syndrome and so you can get this
sort of thing
at exactly the same time
uh while i was tweeting to debunk a
debunk
somebody was online criticizing me for
never debunking that debunk
so i could actually be people will
accuse me of doing of not doing the
thing that i'm doing at exactly the same
time where they are
like right where they are i'm doing the
thing you're not doing the thing well
i'm doing the thing right now you don't
do the thing well look over here i'm
doing the thing and there's a like a
cognitive blindness it's just incredible
i'll give you an example of that exact
thing
but um on the plus side i noticed that
twitter has saved me a lot of time and
energy
because do you know how much energy it
takes to figure out your own priorities
and come up with your own opinion
it's hard
it's a lot of energy but you don't need
that anymore because i can just go on
twitter
and people will tell me what i'm
thinking and what my priorities are
for example today i learned from someone
else on twitter
that i'm not interested in the truth
and honestly i thought i was better than
that
i hoped i was interested in the truth
but until i read this tweet from a total
stranger who has access to my inner
thoughts
and now i know i'm not interested in the
truth
which is very disappointing and i
honestly i lowered my opinion of myself
when i learned this
because
it's amazing how you can be fooled but i
just don't have any interest in the
truth and thank you stranger for
straightening that out
for me it's disheartening it is
um
so here's my snap to grid problem i
believe that uh there are two camps
there's one camp says
ivermectin works
and it's being suppressed by big pharma
the other camp says ivermectin doesn't
work
and there's there's no suppression going
on whatsoever
my opinion is not one of those
my opinion is in all likelihood at least
based on you know incomplete data
there's no evidence that i'm convinced
ivermectin works
but
big pharma is trying to suppress it
so there are two reasons that big pharma
would want to suppress ivermectin
one reason is that it works
the other reason is that it doesn't work
let's see
now
um am i right
there was there would be two reasons to
suppress cyber meccan one because it
worked
and they didn't want to compete with it
and the other because it didn't work
and they didn't want to compete with it
do you see that
they would have two equally very
compelling reasons to kill ivermectin
one of their worked and one that it
didn't work because you'd be competing
with it whether it worked or not
and they didn't why would they want to
compete with it
so
just the fact that they're squelching it
doesn't tell you anything about whether
it works does it
i don't think it does you could confirm
that they're trying to stop it
maybe but that wouldn't tell you whether
it worked
so that's the first thing
and i know that's a
tough the other thing that i've been
hearing a lot is
the doctor who said they treated
one of them treated 500 patients this is
what i heard yesterday
with ivermectin and out of 500 patients
nearly every one of them recovered
almost 100
percent so that's that's pretty good and
then there was a
um
another doctor who treated 120 patients
or so with ivermectin
and every one of them had a good result
out of 120.
that's pretty convincing now the same
doctor reportedly uh treated himself
with ivermectin
when he got it and it didn't work at all
for him and it didn't work for any of
his friends and his close associates
when he tried it with them but for all
the people who took it and then left his
office and never reported back
worked perfectly
so that's what's called anecdotal
science and it's very compelling
now
i
i compared this to another trial i did a
trial on my own in which i tried praying
for all the people that those
doctors were treating and also all of
the other people in the world
who had covet
and i only did it for 24 hours i didn't
like it wasn't day after day so i just
would do one day of praying
that the people who were infected with
kovid would recover
and let me tell you how i did
and i'm proud of this
99 of the people i prayed for
full recovery
99
and
um i know what you're thinking you're
thinking that the natural recovery rate
is actually 99.7
so there is some indication that i
prayed to the wrong god because i i
believe i may have killed over a million
people
by incorrect praying so i only got a 99
effectiveness rate when doing nothing at
all would give you 99.7 apparently
but
still
i think you have to consider this as
part of the anecdotal science
now
i sent around a debunk on ivermectin
that was in the bbc
and then somebody sent me a debunk
of the bbc's debunk
but i also sent a fact check
that debunked ivormectin
and then somebody sent me
a debunk
of the fact check
well
what the hell am i going to do now
somebody said in the comments or i could
be an idiot
i never rule out that possibility
so how do you know if the debunk is
better or not well let me tell you
what the claims are and then the debunks
and i'm not going to claim that the
claim is right or that the debunk is
right
if you can allow me
to be divorced from what's true because
i don't think we can solve that
to just talk about how we process it
right
and
so suppose you heard that there were i
don't know 72 studies
some say 26 but a whole bunch of studies
there are dozens
of studies
that
collectively if you look at them
together they indicate that ivermectin
works
is that convincing
so there are some experts who have
actual credentials that say it works
there are people who use it who say it
works
and then there are dozens of studies
that say it works so that's the claim
it's pretty convincing would you would
you agree
if that's all you ever heard was those
things
that'd be pretty convincing
now then you say but the big pharma says
it doesn't work
and then you say of course they do
of course they say it doesn't work that
doesn't mean anything i'm still
convinced it worked because the people
who say it doesn't work they're not
credible but then the government says it
doesn't work you say wait a minute the
government always lies to us
that doesn't mean anything throw that
out still believe the claim
but what about the other experts
the other experts
say it doesn't work
they've been wrong
the rogues say it does work and they've
got really good credentials
not only that
but you've got all these studies that
say it works you've got doctors that use
it to say it works i believe the claim
is that where many of you are
did did i describe where many of your
where you are roughly
in your current thinking
probably some yeses and snows all right
so here's what the debunk looks like oh
and then part of the claim is and this
is a strong part of the claim that it
actually has worked
in places like
israel
in one
area within india utter pradesh and they
totally crushed it
um and some other places so then you
look at the debunk and let's look at
this utter pradesh place as a good
example because dr malone
um one of the proponents of fibromechan
uh
just tweeted
showing the that there was an actual
written guide and a little packet that
included ivermectin for that area
and he was he was asking for an apology
because he was he had made the claim
that
they got utter
that they got ivermectin in that region
and it crushed
and the data says that the deaths went
down to practically nothing
so here's what dr malone has has proven
um he's proven that
utter pradash did in fact give
ivermectin to its people
because there was an actual photo of the
kit that they got
that seemed pretty good evidence
and then the data
shows that the death rate from kovhan
went to basically zero
that's pretty convincing wouldn't you
say
anybody
are you convinced yet
i mean it's kind of adding up you've got
dozens of studies that say it works you
got
lots of doctors that say they used in
the works you've got some incredible
experts who say not only does it works
it you know in theory it's working in
the real world
here's the region we prove they're using
it and here's their data we proved that
their data that the death rate went to
zero how many of you are convinced
the claim is valid
based on
that
all right
so
if that's all you heard it's it's pretty
darn convincing
i'd have to say
but here's something you maybe you
didn't hear
now i'm not saying it's true
because this this is just the debunk
because somebody's going to debunk the
debunk you know that right
somebody will but here's the debunk and
see if it changes your mind
in utter pradesh during the time that
there were zero cova deaths
there were zero of any kind of deaths
in other words during the same time that
nobody died of
covet
nobody died of car accidents
or heart attacks
or murder
or anything
because
there was a data problem
with deaths
and so the number one best example of
ivermectin working
is very clearly not an example of it
working
because
it didn't cure
auto accidents
did it
and so the people who look at the data
say but all the other deaths are gone
too so obviously it's just a data
problem
so that's the strongest real world
example but you say wait wait there are
other places you know you got israel
but actually that's not the case so
there are a bunch of other examples that
are debunked the same way
that somebody claimed they used it but
if you look into it no no that didn't
happen what about japan
somebody sent me a tweet just yesterday
said that a very highly
highly respected cardiologist
said that there'd been a recommendation
by some you know medical group
and that metal group groups had used
iframecten and japan was using it with
great success
this was from an actual
respected cardiologist in japan who's
telling you his own experience
yes we use it
yes we beat the you know we
we got the kova deaths way down totally
working
convincing right
pretty convincing
well if that's all you heard
yeah that would be pretty darn
convincing
here's the part you didn't hear
but it's the debunk to it
the death rate in japan it's just
average
it's just average
it's average for the region
because all the asian countries are
beating all of the western countries
there may be some exceptions but
basically they're just average
so if japan is using it so successfully
why don't their numbers reflect it
they're doing just same as everybody
else and the other countries are not
reportedly using so does that tell you
that the japan thing was bs
i don't know because there might be a
debunk to the debunk
i just haven't heard it yet
then the bbc did its debunk and said
that
of the big uh trials of
of uh
ivermectin
that a third of them they could identify
obvious huge problems
one-third of the ones they checked out
of 26
i guess they're they're more than that
but they they checked 26 and they found
a third of them had like really big
problems and the kind of problems are
data was cut and pasted
so you can see that it's not even real
data i mean obviously not real data
so that that's how bad some of them were
but you say to yourself but scott there
were also randomized controlled trials
well apparently there was one high
quality randomized controlled trial
there were there were other trials that
had
quality problems but there was one
really good one
that said it didn't work
now
are you convinced
do you think a randomized controlled
trial is convincing
it's the highest standard in science
and there were and according to the bbc
there was only one of them and it said
it didn't work
and the ones that said it did work
have such at least a random you know a
third of them or so that were so
so obviously flawed you couldn't
possibly do a meta-analysis because it
would just be
taking an average of garbage
right now
was there a debunk
to the debunk
of course
so somebody sent me a uh
a video of uh let's see who's this
expert boom
probably wrote his name down here
somewhere
uh dr john campbell he does some videos
he's i think he's pro-ivecton and so he
looks at the bbc article which totally
debunked ivermectin
and then he
totally debunked the bbc article
now he didn't prove it was false
he questioned the
capability of the people
and the sources
because the sources weren't mentioned in
a number of cases and the and the people
involved were not
you know high authorities
so he basically said this is a
journalism
it's not science was he convincing
he was
yeah because the person who goes last
is always convincing
and if somebody were to debunk him
as i will right now
it might actually sound credible too
here's my debunk of him
he questioned the sources
and said that because he couldn't find
what they found
he questioned
it whenever you trigger somebody into
cognitive dissonance
they're going to come after your data
but
they're going to ignore the good
arguments and go after you personally
aren't they
he kind of went after them personally
but he also had a good point
that their data was unfindable
except there was one glaring exception
to that and i didn't see his whole video
yet but i think he didn't get to it
the article did claim that there was
only one good study a randomized
controlled trial and that it said
ivermectin didn't work
i don't know that he addressed that
and correct me if i'm wrong but the
debunk to him would be i think you
ignored their strongest point
and went after their credibility because
it would be easy i think
to determine that there was in fact one
good randomized controlled trial i think
he could find that
now if that didn't exist then the whole
bbc article is garbage of course
but
um right don't trust campbell don't
trust the bbc
don't trust anybody so keep in mind
that the major theme here is that the
last person sounds right and there's
always the last person you're never done
there's always going to be somebody
responding to the response
so if you think you can chase the
turtles all the way down
good luck i can't but i would tell you
that you might be nearing the end
when you find somebody ignoring
the best argument
and going after the credibility of the
debunkers
that would be a sign you may have
reached the final turtle but i don't
know that you could know for sure
just sort of keep that in mind
all right um
so like i said bottom line i don't think
it even matters if i ever met and works
at this point we're so done with
we're so done with everything we've got
two weeks
to get february one we're done working
for those of us in uh the horrible
states
like california where we still have
masks and mandates and stuff
and
uh
what you don't like my turtle analogies
i think it's
internal analogy was excellent
um
and then of course there will be lots of
people who are uh dunking on me
for being pro booster and when of course
i'm not
so watch for how many people are
criticizing me
uh for the opposite of my
personal opinion
or see how many people are
accusing the creator of dilbert
of being too gullible
and trusting of big corporations
to me that's the funniest thing that
came out of the pandemic
is that people assumed that i trusted
big corporations
that might be the silliest thing that's
happened out of all this
the only thing that i i trust is that
they weren't wrong every time
that's it
you know no matter how bad a big company
is
sometimes they make a product that works
it's not like every product every
company made doesn't work
you know so just because they're not
trustworthy doesn't mean
that they made a bad product it just
means it's very likely doesn't mean it
happened
all right
andrew says did you roll up your sleeve
for big pharma scott
well what did you do
uh andrew
um what i did was wait as long as
possible because i didn't trust their
vaccine
and ultimately i just did it so i could
fly
but you trusted the
chinese-engineered bioweapon
so you would trust the virus
which maybe don't know for sure
but it looks like it could have been
designed to hurt you
you would trust the thing that's
designed to hurt you
over the thing that was designed
to protect you
knowing that we don't know for sure
whether it was engineered
or whether the vaccine is more good than
bad in the long run we don't know that
in the short run it looks like
it's more good than bad for
certain people
and uh by the way on youtube if you
didn't catch my uh
professorial move last night
when i i taught you about the upgrade to
science
a new form of science sort of like the
new testament of science but look for
that it's the video i did right before
this one but last night
um
oh the fake hostage situation i don't i
don't think it's fake
but
it's also not important
all right
that is all i have to say today
and go niners and all that
and
uh you suppose that there's only one bio
weapon on the shelf no
uh
why did doctors
right land bane that i'm gonna ignore
your all caps
never aspire to be a lab rap
well here's your here's the thing
if the only choice was to get vaccinated
or not
i would have chose not
everybody get that
would you all agree with me if the only
variable was a vaccine or no vaccine
i would take no vaccine
fair
but if you add the variable that you
have a choice of two
two unknowns
one might be a chinese bio weapon
with long-term consequences we can't
anticipate
and the other one might be a vaccine
with long-term consequences we can't
anticipate
you didn't get a choice
of avoiding the experimental drug
did you
no you didn't
you got a choice of which experimental
drug or in which order you got them
i chose to get the protection before the
chinese engineered bioweapon
if you chose to get the bio weapon first
and then the protection
apparently that does have some benefits
but i don't think it's as good
just my guess
now i don't know that for sure but
neither do you so we're all guessing
all right
there's a double chance of the unknowns
that's true
yep two unknowns i do like the fact that
if i can do anything to reduce the
amount of impact
the alleged chinese engineered bio
weapon has on me
then i would do that that feels like the
better
it feels like the better play
with
the context of so many unknowns
all right
did you get the job before the
breakthrough cases were happening yes
yeah long before we knew that there were
breakthrough cases which wouldn't have
changed my mind i don't think
because i you know in
i i got it so i didn't die
you know at least that was the gamble
we're making i didn't get it so i
wouldn't transmit it
i got it to stay alive
so
it still seems to work for that
allegedly
allegedly
the erasure of choice
uh the erasure of choice yeah we're all
bothered by that
all right
that's all i got to say for today
um
do you feel remorse for helping big
pharma
why would i feel remorse
now how many of you think i i helped
them
by telling you that i wasn't going to
get vaccinated for six months
because i didn't trust the vaccinations
how many of you people know that
how many people know
that i waited for i think six months
specifically because i didn't trust them
which i said over and over and over
again i don't trust them i don't trust
them i don't trust them and then when i
did
i told you i didn't know it was the
right answer
and i
basically if i if i didn't have to fly i
might have made a different decision
so
how does that sound to you like
like i helped them
i'm not sure that they would have paid
me to wait six months telling saying
that i didn't
uh
jack herrera on train wreck
i said i felt free once i got vaccinated
right that was my subjective
opinion which still holds
now why would you have a problem with me
telling you what i feel subjectively
why is that threatening to you
that i got the feeling when i got it
because i was free of you know worrying
about
really anything but an inconvenience
after that
vax isn't mandated to fly it it was
mandated to fly to greece
so out of the country
um
i think it was mandated
to get through germany
to get to greece or something like that
but it was mandated somewhere along the
way
um
you did not have to fly that's correct i
could have gotten a divorce right away
you're right
i did have the option of not flying
i could have gotten a divorce you are
correct
so thanks for pointing that out all
right that's all you got the job the jab
and defended it
you got the job and defended it
what do words mean to you
if i say there's
you know their costs and their benefits
and in the end i just guessed
that sounds like it i defended it
that's a weird use of words but okay
okay
you know if you keep that up you're
going to be promoted to mascot
but that's all for now i'll talk to you
tomorrow
