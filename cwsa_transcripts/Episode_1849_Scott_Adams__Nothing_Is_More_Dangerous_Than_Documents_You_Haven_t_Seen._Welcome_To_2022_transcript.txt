good morning everybody
and congratulations for making here on
time if you did
for
coffee was god adams the highlight of
civilization certainly the highlight of
your life so far
although tomorrow looks good too
hey
does anybody want to take it up a notch
i know
i know it's possible and all you need is
a cover bugger a glass of tiger jealous
just either canteen jug or flask a
vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing makes
everything better
everything it's called the simultaneous
sip
it happens now
go
yeah yeah
i don't know if it was the notes of
chocolate in my coffee beans or the
simultaneity that made it so good but oh
it was extra good extra good
so
you know that i've been
mentioning
ai a lot and
machiavelli's underbelly a an account
you should all be following on twitter
uh apparently has asked ai to reproduce
my voice
so
here's i think that's ai doing a little
picture of me
i'm going to read a.i impersonating my
voice
now keep in mind
that we know ai can can speak smoothly
right
in the old days computers would be like
you are listening to a computer
but you know that if you talk to one of
your digital assistants it will speak in
full sentences that sound fluent
so this is not yet
fluid
it's not fluid it doesn't flow
but listen to this
ai
impersonate me and keep in mind
i've never said any of these
sentences
maybe i've said the words
but these sentences have never happened
anywhere except in ai
ready
your life is the sum of a remainder is
an unbalanced equation and you're into
the programming of the matrix you're the
eventuality of an anomaly which despite
my sincerest efforts i have been
honorable to eliminate
from
what is otherwise a harmony of
mathematical precision while it remains
a burden and essentially avoided is not
unexpected and it's not being a measure
of control which has led you unexhorably
here
all right so here's what a.i scott said
your life is the sum of a remainder of
an unbalanced equation
your life is a sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation
that either means something
or nothing
yeah kill it now if it means something
i'm a little bit worried
i hope that doesn't mean something don't
you
because what if what if your life is the
sum of a remainder of an unbalanced
equation what the hell does that mean
all right so
you could tell that it was sort of a
a drunk sounding version of me it uh he
talked like like it was
learning some words or something like
that
but you know that they can fix that part
right because it has been fixed and lots
of other applications
so
think about how easily this can create a
fake
audio of me
from this day forward i'm going to call
it
if you hear an audio
you can't trust it
from this day forward you can't trust
any audio you ever hear again
you got that
because the news is going to do this to
you for years the news is going to be
producing audios that you think are true
only to find out that they're not that
they're hoaxes you're gonna have a lot
of that coming
right a lot of it now even if it's
paired with a video
suppose it's paired with a video
nope
because you've seen the tom cruise deep
fakes they're really good
so you could you could match your audio
and your video pretty easily now
so from this point on you can't trust
anything you hear on audio or anything
you see on video
but thank god
thank god we can trust what we see in
documents
am i right
thank god we get to see all the
documents
well more on that in a minute
so i i'm always experimenting on social
media about how to make my critics shut
up
and i feel like i hit a home run
recently
on the critics shut up technique
so most of my critics lately
no matter what the topic is
they will rush into my mentions or rush
into my twitter feed
and they'll try to tell the world that i
got everything wrong about the pandemic
and vaccinations
if you follow me on twitter you've seen
that right it's almost every tweet it
seems like anything that gets any kind
of
attraction
somebody piles in and says i used to
like you until your bad takes about the
pandemic
right have you noticed that
so i i've been i tried arguing with
people it was like okay give me an
example of what i got wrong and then
that becomes changing the subject etc
and i couldn't really make them stop
so i put together and i read it to
yesterday the this goddamn's hoax quiz
so instead of
replying to their ridiculous claims
about me i simply publish a quiz
of all the hoaxes that people believe
about me
and i just make sure that theirs is on
the list
stops it cold
there's almost never even a comment
after i publish that the the tweet just
goes
totally dead
and i thought huh i guess this laundry
list thing works now in this case the
laundry list is all true
it's just a bunch of things that people
believe
about me that aren't true and when you
see them on a list
that must be what makes a difference
because if i simply said that thing you
think is not true
people just say oh it is true
because you said it and i'll go find
that tweet
but if i put it on a list of a bunch of
stuff that's not true
people just go away
so i guess the context made a difference
all right well there's a
study
do you believe studies
if i tell you that there's a study
what should be your first
impression
probably not
probably not true probably can't be
reproduced
but if you know your studies are
unreliable how you how should you
consume them
there's one good way to do it
if it agrees with what you already
believe to be true or you want it to be
true
act like it is
because it makes you feel good
so here's one i'm gonna read to you
that i don't know if this is true i have
no idea if this is true
but it makes me feel good so
if everybody's okay we're going to
pretend it's true okay
just pretend it's true
so the study says that homeschoolers
exhibit higher achievements on social
competency
indices than their counterparts
attending traditional schools
so the
the study purports to say that
homeschooling
doesn't hurt you socially and that they
might actually be ahead socially
what do you think
i i would say that that fits my
observation
my observation is that whenever i've met
a homeschooler there they have better
social skills
does anybody have the same experience
i think a hundred percent of the
homeschoolers i met have clearly
like it's just it just
it just jumps off them
it's not subtle is it
so that's the other thing it's not
subtle
you meet a homeschooler
all right let me ask you this
you meet a 12 year old homeschooler as
an adult
all right you're an adult let's say you
meet the family and then you're
introduced to the 12 year old
you tell me does that 12 year old make
contact
make eye contact and shake your hand
and greet you in an in a socially adult
way
probably
probably
yup the homeschooler is going to look
you in the eye shake your hand and maybe
even ask how are you doing
maybe
right
now what happens if some public school
kids come into your house
let's say with your kids
have you had this experience
one of your teen kids will bring
somebody back to the house you know
friend of theirs
when they walk through the kitchen and
you're standing in the kitchen
do they stop and say oh i'd like you to
i'd like to introduce you to my friends
and then you know you say oh this is
this is bob and
you know blah blah blah
you shake hands make eye contact has
that ever happened
well it has
it's not that it's never happened
but it's pretty unusual
you usually usually uh public school
kids will treat you like furniture
am i right
a public school educated teen
will treat an adult in their own house
i'm talking about me in my own house
they'll walk past me like i'm the
 furniture
has nothing to do with them being you
know good kids or bad kids it doesn't
have anything to do that it's just how
they're socialized
they're socialized that
i'm irrelevant
in my own house
right
so no that's not all of them
and and anytime that you know one of the
teens would bring somebody home
who would actually stop and say yes say
hi or even make eye contact that that
person would immediately be my favorite
you know favorite of the kids friends
right oh somebody made eye contact and
said hi
so
so i agree with that story so i'll act
like it's true
so this whole rob reiner thing
has some legs as a social media story
anyway so rob ryder has been trending
all morning on twitter
for being a dumbass
that's the worst reason to
to trend on twitter
don't say be head
do not say meathead
and don't do it
don't don't do it
because you know
it's only it's only the npcs who are
saying meathead now
don't do it
it's the most obvious thing you could
say
don't do it
all right
well here's what's uh interesting about
it
that that video was rupaard
the video i think
many of you saw it bill maher uh
interviewing
rob reiter and
and it usually ends with bill maher's
quip
that rob reiner must be watching msnbc
because rob reiner was not aware that
the hunter biden laptop story was
suppressed
by the intelligence organizations and
the media and that that's just a fact
that's not speculation
that's that's everybody knows that's
just a fact
and
and rob reiner didn't know it
now to me that would be one of the most
obvious things that you could know
if you were following the news on both
sides but here's the part that got cut
off
rob reiner said that he actually does
watch fox news
he does watch fox news and that that
part of his quote gets cut off so after
mars says well you're watching msnbc
he goes
i also watch fox news
now let me ask you a question
is it possible to watch fox news
for more than 30 seconds
without seeing a reference to the hunter
biden laptop being suppressed by the
media
how in the world can you watch fox news
for more than 30 seconds and not hear
that story because it gets brought into
every other story
well it looks like climate change is
you know heating up
well what about hunter buttons you know
hunter's a laptop i mean it's in every
story on every segment wall-to-wall
so it turns out that
not only is rob reiner
poorly informed
but he's quite a liar isn't he
that had to be a lie
because what does it mean to say you
watch fox news he saw a clip once
i think it means that he sees a clip
that they show and a context on fox on
cnn and msnbc to make fun of fox news
it's the same thing fox news does of the
other networks
so
what do you think happened with rob
reiner after the story
do you believe that he went back
and said wow there could be something
i'm missing here
and then looked into the hunter biden
laptop story
and then
um determined that he was wrong
about that and then maybe corrected it
probably not
here's another part of the story that
should just make you crazy
amy klobuchar was sitting right next to
rob reiner
and acted as if she wasn't quite you
know
up to speed on the hunter biden laptop
story being suppressed
now
now amy
amy amy amy if i could call you by your
first name now that sounds too sexist so
i'm going to go with klobuchar
senator klobuchar
less sexist
all right all right senator klobuchar
um
really
really
you you couldn't give us that
the the sides are you know the sides are
so rigorously formed
that you couldn't even say yes you know
rob you know that that is in the news
couldn't couldn't even give us a little
bit right
i mean that really hurts your
credibility doesn't it
now
things are so bad
that here's an actual question that was
asked of me
today
i want to get the exact language right
because it's
it matters
the exact language was
missing from my notes
but i was asked today
effectively
if it turned out
if
if it turned out
that the mar-a-lago documents
had uh the names and let's say ways to
identify
um
intelligence assets
which would be about the most dangerous
thing you could have right besides
military secrets the most dangerous
thing you could have would be some way
to identify our spies
and somebody said to me
scott
if it turns out
that that trump knowingly
had in his possession the identity of
spies
would you change your opinion about how
important this story is
now think about that somebody asked me
that question in all seriousness and i
think this was an actual not like a
crazy person
it was just a regular democrat
asked me this question in in public
if trump knowingly had
knowingly this and this is important if
he knowingly
had the names of our spies and boxes in
mar-a-lago
would i then change my opinion to this
is actually a big problem
and i said
yes
yes
of course that would be a big problem
now here's the weird thing
there's a real living person who thought
that that wouldn't bother me
that i would still just side with trump
no matter what he did
what
like how would you how would you ever
have that impression
that i would take his side
if he had done something
that was so blatantly illegal and
dangerous
the problem is that nobody believes this
stuff
right the the problem is not that i
support people who do bad things
the problem is
that the bad things are not demonstrated
to be true
that's the problem
if there's anything that's demonstrated
to be true
that happened while he was in office you
know that's relevant to the presidency
that would make a difference
i could definitely change my mind on
trump in a heartbeat
but i need some you know evidence
not just
not just somebody's speculation
here's the other fun that i'm having
today
is uh people trying to dunk on me by
saying
oh so you're saying that those documents
in mar-a-lago are not important
but what scott what did you say about
hillary's email gotcha
i gotcha
all right you're saying that the that
the trump documents are not that
important right
but what did you say about hillary
hillary's email
explain that explain your inconsistency
with hillary's email being so important
but the trump documents are not explain
that scott
and do you know how i explain it
i always said her documents weren't
important you can find no evidence that
i ever thought her emails was an issue
that i gave a about or that i ever
thought that she would go to jail for it
or that i thought that it should be
worthy of our attention
do i think that she should have had
unsecured email
probably not
did you hear the reason that she had an
unsecured email
this is a good test of your bubble
all right so those of you on the right
what reason did they give i'm not saying
it's true
but what reason did they give
for having their own email
the regular email didn't work
that was the reason the regular email
system there was some problem whether it
was old or inefficient or something it
just didn't work
so she just needed to send messages to
people and didn't have a way to do it
now is that true i don't know
but have you ever heard it
see this is a test of your bubble
had you ever heard
that that if she had used the official
email it was so broken that it barely
was useful
i don't know the details but there
wasn't really the option of using the
regular one if she wanted to be
efficient
now is that the real reason
i have no idea
maybe the real reason is to keep her
secrets
that'd be a perfectly reasonable reason
so i don't know the real part
but i never thought it was important i
never thought the email was a story was
important
so people are quite disappointed to find
out that i'm consistent
across the parties
all right um
what else is going on
so i did a uh poll on twitter
i ask people what do they think is the
biggest risk to the united states
and i think you can determine what is
the biggest risk to the united states
based on what stories
are getting the most attention
that's fair to say right the stories
getting the most attention are probably
the most important ones
so um
so i gave three choices on the poll the
biggest risk the united states climate
change was a choice but only three
percent said climate change was the
biggest risk
84 said china
china was the biggest risk
and 13 said documents
uh documents
i think that's the correct answer
documents
that you haven't seen
are the biggest risks to the united
states documents yes
um
uh the
oh so eric is telling me
i just got here uh the sum of the
remainder of an unbalanced equation
which is what the ai was saying on my
behalf is both syntactically perfect and
makes sense to a double engineer
be at a bit more new age hippie dippy
than you are
all right so it makes sense to an
engineer
okay
um so watch out for documents don't
worry about china so much it's the
documents
have you noticed that most of the news
is now about
information the public is not allowed to
see
when did that
happen didn't the news usually the news
was usually about stuff you can see
and now the news is all speculation
about things you can't see
so what examples do we have
how about the iran deal
have you seen the details of the iran
deal
that's like a major story i've never
seen the details i've never even seen a
summary
have you
so we have pretty strong opinions about
that iran deal
i don't know what's in it
so we're just speculating that how about
those big legislative victories those
big spending bills
did you know what was in the spending
bills that you're either very much for
or very much against
i don't
we're just sort of guessing
and some of the big things we do know
then there was a the hunter laptop story
which you know now we're seeing some
things that were actually in it but that
was suppressed
um
how about the the ray epps testimony and
we just have to speculate
what did ray up say to anybody who asked
them questions i don't know
just have to speculate
how about
the mar-a-lago documents
what's in there i don't know
i don't know but i have some strong
opinions about that stuff
well here's the basis for my strong
opinion
i think you'd actually have to be
batshit crazy
to believe that trump knowingly
knowingly
included dangerous secrets in those
in those documents
i suppose anything's possible
anything's possible but isn't it the
least likely possibility
of all the things that are possible
the least likely
is that trump knew there were dangerous
secrets
and
twisted some arms to get to get it in
those boxes
now given that trump did not pack the
boxes
do you think there was a gsa employee
who knew that some secret should not be
packed in those boxes for mar-a-lago but
did it anyway
do you think that happened
do you think a gsa employee
looked at some documents and said ooh
these are super secret dangerous and
then trump said oh i'll pack those
anyway and send them to mar-a-lago and
then the gsa person said oh okay i guess
if you're telling me to do it it's fine
which by the way would be
declassification
so it would be fine it would be it would
be fine in terms of being legal
but don't you think that gsa employee
would have talked to somebody
like right at that time um i know he can
declassify anything i get it
but he just declassified the names of
all of our cia agents
that
that never happened by the way
i'm just giving you a weird example
but do you think that the gsa person
would just say oh okay
i guess the nuclear codes are are okay
as if he could actually use the nuclear
codes if if you found them
but the whole story is ridiculous
there there is no you can't even
describe a scenario in which trump could
have done something wrong
can you
you actually can't even describe
an imaginary scenario where it was
physically possible for him to have done
anything wrong
physically possible
because
there's nobody who believes the gsa
employee would have just shoved some
nuclear codes i'm using nuclear codes as
a ridiculous example
we all we're all smart enough to know
that even if you had the nuclear codes
you couldn't launch
you all know that right
if i gave you the nuclear codes you
couldn't launch
but it's the funniest thing to say
because it sounds like it's dangerous
so but do you really believe a gsa
employee would just say all right i'll
put the dangerous stuff in this box
and wouldn't talk to a wouldn't talk to
a superior
it would not have already gone up the
line
i mean none of this story makes any
sense
first of all do you believe he was
standing in the room
directing what went in the box
not a chance not a chance there's not
the slightest chance that that trump
could tell you what's in those boxes
i mean maybe some things you know sort
of generally
so this whole story is just getting the
public to talk about things they haven't
seen
what about trump's taxes
how much have we talked about trump's
taxes
that we haven't seen
how about all those you know
russian deals we haven't seen how about
that whole
the mueller
report that we didn't get to see forever
how about the epstein client list
do you see the pattern
the news has become
making the public talk about things they
can't see
that's really dangerous
really dangerous
if the news would stick with things you
can see
i think we'd stay out of trouble
but as long as the news is willing to
give us our full dose of speculation
about things we can't see
how in the world could we ever be less
divided
because we're arguing about speculative
things they're not even real arguments
i'm having arguments with people like i
guess you could call it that about what
would happen in a imaginary scenario
okay
in the imaginary scenario that trump was
had nuclear secrets in his boxes in
mar-a-lago
what would happen then
well it's imaginary
so we've actually run out of real news
haven't we
we're out of news
there's no news
it's just imaginary stuff and the stuff
that's not imaginary
is computer models that are completely
non-credible
so what about the uh the computer models
projecting climate change 80 years in
the future
is that real
it's as real as those documents you're
guessing about so we're guessing about
financial and climate models
we're guessing about what's in documents
we're guessing what's in the legislation
we're guessing what's in the iranian
deal
we have no idea what's going on
somehow the public has been
uh
been trained to argue about things that
aren't even close to real
we're literally arguing about imaginary
problems and we know they're imaginary
because we literally say well if
like it's not like we're accidentally
arguing over imaginary things
we're doing it intentionally
[Laughter]
we'll start an argument over an
imaginary thing
and then we're then we say that we're
divided
are you really divided
if you're arguing about imaginary things
let me tell you the healthiest country
you could ever live in
they don't have any real stuff to talk
about
if the only problems are imaginary ones
you're in pretty good shape
let me say again
something that is the most obvious thing
in the world to me
but i believe is invisible to most of
you
it goes like this
we are so far from a civil war
we are so far away from that
there isn't even like a little seed of a
germ of a possibility of that
none
because ultimately we americans sort of
like each other
we do
and you know all the people who would
say ah let's
let's separate from all those
republicans
do you know what they all know
i don't think they'll say it out loud
but you know what everybody on the left
probably knows
a little bit of exaggeration here a
little bit of hyperbole but you know
what they know
that without the republicans they'd be
totally
they would be they wouldn't be safe
that so the left definitely doesn't want
to
divorce itself from not only
where it can get benefits but where it
can be protected
do you think the right really wants a
divorce
from the left well that's a little
dicier
because the right might say to
themselves well the left just costs us
money
you know and we could get rid of all of
the left and we would just have more
money and we'd be able to go to the
schools we want to and we wouldn't be
bothered anymore
so there's that
but
i do not see the uh patriots on the
right breaking up the republic
i just don't see it
and the people who talk about it it's
always talked about in the
sort of the same way that republicans
talk about the second amendment
protecting against your own government
you know republicans and conservatives
are always saying oh that's going to be
a revolution
well you know it's a good thing i
clean my guns
right it's just sort of the way they
talk
we're not anywhere near anything like
that
we are so not divided as a country it's
crazy
if you've lived through the 60s
you know that you're just seeing sort of
baseline stuff that we talk about it's a
lot like every generation says the next
generation is doomed
you know my generation was pretty good
but
this future generation i don't know
i think this is the one where it all
ends and then it never does
do you know why do you know why no
matter how pathetic the next generation
looks do you know why things will be
fine
even even though the youth look like
they're all destroyed by social media
and everything else do you know why
everything will be fine
because civilization never depended on
more than a few people
in these workers and you know
and population
but the people who make a difference
very few people
very few and those very few people are
probably just as functional as they ever
were maybe better who knows
so the very few people who ever moved
anything forward will still just keep
doing it
and the rest of us will be flailing like
we always do
so we're fine all right here's the
latest gas lighting
um
how many what would be your guess
of how many people in the voting public
let's say somebody who's smart enough to
vote in the united states
how many people who are smart enough to
vote
would also be able to define
an indictment versus a prosecution
how many could tell you the difference
publish your story on npcs
uh if i said yes i wouldn't ever get to
it
so the hardest thing to do
content
people are sending me content all day
long
so i tend not to agree with it
so i'm looking
maybe not more than a quarter is my
guess a quarter of the public would know
it
so now you see the trick right if only a
quarter of the public knows that an
intent
doesn't mean much of anything
you know you've heard the old saying
you can indict a ham sandwich
meaning that you just have to give
i guess the grand is it what is it
called the
what's it called the jury that decides
if you're indicted is called the
the grand jury
so when the grand jury indicts
the public doesn't understand that they
don't do it on proof
they do it on well there's definitely a
red flag there
there's a reason to look into it that's
all it is there's a reason to look into
it
so
when the news tells you that there's a
quote probable cause for the indictment
what does the uh what do 75 percent of
the voting public
make of that
the experts are telling you there was
probably probable cause
probably probable cause for an
indictment
what if you added all that together
probably
probable cause
for an indictment
if you add it all together it's nothing
it's literally nothing nothing it
doesn't add up to anything
it's simply an indication that you
should look into it
and in a political context
do you even trust that that the the flag
to look into it is legitimate
i don't
in a political process i assume that
anybody can get indicted by the other
side
and i think also you can get indicted by
somebody that your side appointed
because i think any judge is going to
say well
i don't want to treat this so
differently than i treated every other
thing
and i i allowed
you know some indictments go to go
forward for other stuff that were just
as weak
so
yeah so the fact that it's political
makes it more likely somebody will try
to get an indictment
but if they try the odds of success are
really good
so the gaslighting is to make it seem as
though
the probability of a probable cause to
support
an indictment
actually means something when it doesn't
really mean anything
um
how many of you have seen my
clip
that is the the clip that's taken out of
yesterday's livestream
in which i cried
about the documents
i think it's got over 200 000 views now
jack busabek
tweeted it and went viral
so it's got about 200 000 views
probably the most most viewed thing i've
done this year
um so here's a question for you
is it true that the fbi is leaking
information about the mar-a-lago
documents
can you confirm that is that actually
happening
has something leaked about the documents
the mar-a-lago documents
so we don't know if it's the fbi or the
doj right
i always
treat them the same
all right so there was some leaking
so if
if the fbi is not a secure place for
documents because they leak
i asked people in the poll what would be
a more secure place if you could put
those documents somewhere
where nobody could ever see them
and you wanted them to be really safe
how would you do it
so i asked a poll i said
i gave three choices for documents that
you would never see
three places you could put those
documents where you're guaranteed
that nobody would see them number one on
hunter's laptop
number two
on a cnn primetime show
and number three on andrew tayne's
social media
three places nobody will ever see those
secrets
if you happen to be on the locals
platform
you can see the third choice that i
originally had
which was
so awful
so awful i could not do it on regular
twitter
so awful
it's really quite awful
quite funny
but quite awful so only the people in
locals got to see that version
how do you think the
russian sanctions are working
how about those russian sanctions
are they working
um
well i got an update here on cnn
so it does look like their gdp might
have something like a four to six
percent decline projected
but that's less decline than experts
were saying before they were saying
eight to ten percent and now it's down
to maybe six percent
and even that's an estimate
but apparently because uh
the oil prices the energy prices are so
high
and they can sell energy to other places
such as asia
they've been doing fine so the ruble is
fine
uh if you go to moscow it looks like it
always looked there's just as much
traffic
but
russia's survival
depends on one factor
what is the one factor that russia's
economic survival depends on
go
oil price exactly take it take it
another level
go further oil price correct go further
go further
who who's the one person in the world
that could put
russia out of business
here's all it would take
for the united states to start pumping
more oil
that's it
if the united states pumps more oil
the price of oil drops
and then
russia has nothing because only the
price of oil is keeping russia in
business
and the only reason the price of oil is
high
well it's because
it's all the reasons but the one reason
that could be most easily tweaked
is american production
natural gas too so let's throw oil and
natural gas into the into the mix i'm
going to treat them like the same thing
for this conversation
right
so
this is interesting isn't it
on one hand the biden administration
completely failed with the sanctions
because they're not really hurting
russia
on the other hand
the biden administration did push them
right to the point
where the only thing keeping them in
business is our decision about how much
oil we pump
we do have them by the balls
except i don't know that biden would
ever be able to pull the trigger on that
now imagine for a while imagine
imagine a president trump coming back
into office
and the office he comes back into
has
putin solidly by the balls
i mean i'm talking about both hands
wrapped around his gonads as hard as
they could be wrapped
and the only thing you have to do
to snap his balls completely off
is to say let's let's drill for more oil
in america and more gas
that's it
basically
trump has
in his power
because at this point it looks like he
could win win the election again at this
point
putin is totally
unless something changes
now one thing that could change is that
russia could get involved in trying to
prevent
trump from coming to office
so will they
will russia get involved again trying to
prevent trump from getting elected
maybe maybe they'll release all of
hillary's emails who knows anything
could happen
but
and then the other question i have is
i'm trying to understand
the energy shortage that's coming in
europe that everybody says is coming
i don't understand the disconnect
between how we're talking about it
and what we're predicting
they don't seem the same right now
am i is it just me
because if what they're predicting
is true
there's no bigger problem
it's like the only thing we should be
talking about
we if it's true let me let me say it
another way
if it's true that europe is in as much
trouble as it looks like energy wise
and america is not creating more energy
for the benefit of europe
we need to
stage that insurrection
if we're not helping europe with a
problem of this magnitude
and we can
not only could we help them we'd make
money
we would actually make a profit
we'd make a profit
saving europe because we'd just be
selling energy
and then we're not going to do it
do you think that europe owes us
anything if we don't save europe do they
owe us anything in the future
nope
nope
i'm afraid not
if you think you want to ask europe for
a favor if you let if we let
let me be as clear as possible
if we intentionally we america
if the united states intentionally
allows europe to freeze and die this
winter
when we could
do something about
it we don't deserve anything
we we deserve nothing in return
europe should never do us a favor again
i mean that should want you forever
that's a big problem
right and
there's
you know
our relationship with europe is always
sort of a sibling situation
in my view like we fight like cats and
dogs about you know economic stuff and
whatever but ultimately
ultimately
we do have their backs
if we want them to have our back someday
and i think we do
i think we do want that
so just joe biden
um
i feel like europe should tell us
directly
if you don't help us this this winter
 off
i mean i'd like to see france and
germany and the uk i'd like to see
europe speak as one against the united
states in this case
i'd like to see the united states just
be put under the boot for this
we should be paying for this
like this this penalty needs to be on us
because we're if we let europe go down
and we can stop it
we suck
i mean we really as people
you know this this is a who you are
situation
right
this is not a strategy situation
it's not exactly a defense situation
it's not exactly an economic decision
this
is figuring out who you are
right do you wake up in the morning
let's say you're american if you do you
wake up in the morning and you're glad
to be an american
many of you are some of you not so much
but
how do i wake up in the morning if
russia is i'm sorry if europe is
freezing to death
in january
am i going to wake up in the morning and
say oh it's just another day
i don't think so
i think i think at that point we have to
take down our own government
what can i say without being banned from
social media
can i say that i think you would have to
seriously look to taking down your own
government
if it didn't help europe through an
emergency
i think it's that important
like this is
this is a survival
existential kind of thing and i'm not
talking about
survival
through the winter
because europe will survive you know
there might be deaths and way too many
of them based on
on energy shortages that's possible
but the the implications of not helping
in this situation are way bigger than
even the deaths that happen which could
be quite big
so
i really think we need to
remember who we are
i guess that's the best way to say it
so i would make an appeal to any
americans listening to this
it's time to figure out who you are
let's decide who we want to be
do you want to be the one who watches
europe freeze
because that's who you are right now
that's who you are
if you're an american you're an american
who's letting your allies freeze
to death
to death
and you could you could stop it
not only could you stop it it would not
be a sacrifice you would make a profit
and you're not going to do it
so let's decide if we just are
right
we we get to we get to reinvent
ourselves every now and then
if we don't do something a lot more than
we're doing
we we in america
we citizens of the united states are
 losers
and we don't deserve any of your
kindness in the future
that's what i think
so i don't want to be that person i'd
rather be the people who help their
allies
so joe biden
he maybe get a little flexible
maybe you need to get a little flexible
so we'll see what happens
and i guess the israel is a
kind of upset with joe biden
because there's some risk that the
united states and european allies will
make some kind of a deal with iran that
israel doesn't
like
and here's my question
is that even possible
how could the united states
and other european countries how could
they sign off on a deal with iran
that israel says is absolutely no good
could we do it
now
technically we could legally we could
but would we
because what would that do
it just guarantees that israel attacks
iran
doesn't it
because israel would have no choice at
that point they would have to just start
taking out the nuclear facilities
the generals they take out the
leadership
doesn't it guarantee a war with iran
i mean an israeli war with iran
and then we get dragged in because we're
always dragged in
so
it's very curious
and i don't know what the right answer
is by the way
but i don't see a situation where we
will make a deal if israel
has a really strong objection
what do you think
do you think the biden administration
would throw israel under a bus
which would be israel's point of view
the biden administration would say no
so you're saying obama did so biden
would
could be
could be
now how many of you believed that uh the
israeli
lobby and jewish americans controlled
the government
clearly not true right
if you thought that israel was
controlling the u.s government
it doesn't look like it at the moment
it looks like israel's kind of straining
to get something acceptable
so that that does that
that kind of hurts the narrative a
little bit
however i do believe that in the end we
won't do anything that israel objects to
in this case
one reason would be it would increase
the likelihood of a trump
return so if biden signs a bad iran deal
you're going to have to assume that
israel is going to be pushing for trump
to return
and i don't know what kind of resources
they have
would you be concerned if israel had a
strong preference about who becomes
president next
do you think they could influence that
of all the countries that could
influence our elections
you don't think israel could do it
better
than other countries
yeah i think they could do it better if
that was their desire
all right
i think that's about all i had to say
today
i'm sure it was all awesome
yes it was
why would they desire want
um
so that's usually all you need
concerned more about
kazarians okay
i'm being
i'm being schooled on how to pronounce
jack posabic's name
did i say pasabic i thought he said
possamic
all right
uh
so many factors involved right
play the robot's voice again
you you want to hear the robot's voice
again
who wants to hear the robot voice again
nobody
we'll find it
all right robot voice coming up
the remainder of an unbalanced equation
and you're into the programming of the
matrix you're the eventuality of an
anomaly which despite my sincerest
efforts i have been honorable to
eliminate
from
what is otherwise a harmony of
mathematical person
it could be the ai knows that i talk
nonsense
uh the robot's voice is a quote from the
matrix oh okay
uh did you read the permission script
machiavelli
no i didn't a permission script
i don't think i saw that
i did see that
machiavelli's underbelly
the twitter account
did try to have the ai create a dilbert
comic
but it lacked a punch line
so i think the only thing that a ai
can't do is figure out what a punch line
is
because the only reason that anybody
recognizes a punchline is that they can
feel it physically
well that's not true but generally a
good punch line is one that you feel
but the a i can't feel
so the only way you would know what a
good one is
is to ask people so it would have to a b
test every possibility
and also humor depends on our
things we've experienced
so if there's hum if there's a joke
about something that's on your mind it's
always funnier but ai doesn't have the
ability to know what's on your mind
at least not easily
jokes create tension then release it no
no they don't
yeah i've seen a lot of definitions of
what makes a joke but if you don't write
jokes for a living
they sound reasonable
it's stuff like it's tragedy plus time
or it's bad things happening to other
people
or it's something shocking and
surprising and none of those really get
to
what makes something funny
um
punchline checkers
did you know that the male taint is
getting shorter as their testosterone
levels decrease
are you saying that
people's genitalia and their butthole is
starting to get closer together are they
going to merge
will the lack of testosterone cause the
men to
have their buttholes and their genitalia
emerge until they have vaginas
i don't think it's true
oh you heard it on joe rogan well must
be true then it must be true
all right
all right here's something i said
privately today
but because i have a death wish i'm
going to say it publicly
i'm going to make a statement
and i just want to see your reaction to
it
now keep in mind
that i am aware that all statements that
are like
definitive everything is like this you
know all statements that are absolutes
or false
except for that one
maybe maybe that one too
but i'm going to make a statement of an
absolute just know it's hyperbole okay
there are no feminists in private
your reaction
privately
one woman and one man in a room no no
witnesses there are no feminists
look how many people are agreeing
now
[Laughter]
your comments are hilarious
because the the men are all agreeing
i don't know if the women are
but the men are all all agreed
all right
is it is anybody disagreeing
i don't think i saw a disagreement did i
i saw one okay
uh
that is so funny i thought i was going
to get all kinds of disagreement
no is it just because of the nature of
the audience
so so here's another one that
that i like to say this one will mess
you up too
you ready for this one
no woman
knows how women act
with men
they only know how they act
no woman
knows how other women act with men oh
they talk
and they talk about nasty things and
they really get down to
feelings and you know sex stuff sure
women talk about all the nasty details
and stuff
you know what they don't tell you
what really happens when they're alone
with a man
you're never gonna hear that
because everything becomes individual
then right
everything's on the table when you're
alone
all right uh
there are no feminists in the fire
somebody says there are no feminists in
the fire
oh they're male feminists that's true
right
there's more of a chance that the man
would be the feminist in a room with a
woman that's true
it's more likely that the man would say
something feminist
um
don't make me a sandwich
um
all right i'm not reading your comments
because some of them are just too funny
all right i didn't think i'd get away
with that
i did not think i'd get away with that i
thought i was going to be uh
you know attacked
but somehow i got away with saying that
there are no feminists in private
here's another one
you ready for this one
it's another one like that one
nobody's ever been offended
nobody's ever been offended
this never happened
everybody's sure somebody else is
yeah
even when i say i'm offended
it's not really offended
there might be just somebody i don't
want to associate with
or somebody has a view that i think
would be you know non-productive for a
politician i'm not really
offended but i'm always sure that
somebody else is
except i never meet that person
have you ever met anybody who was
actually offended
people will say they are
but not in private not private in
private nobody admits they're offended
in private and here's the reason
because being offended is weak
right
people don't want to tell you they're
weak
oh words hurt me you hurt me with your
words i'm offended
so everybody's sure that other people
are weak but they're strong that's the
way they'd like to present themselves oh
it doesn't bother me i'm way above that
but i'm pretty sure that these
these poor people over here are getting
offended by this stuff you should come
to calm it down
you don't have standing to be offended
then what causes revenge well it's not
being offended
there are lots of reasons for revenge
um
yeah our our entire existence is
imaginary stuff like we're imagining
what's in documents
we're imagining the other people are
getting offended we're imagining that we
can predict the future in 80 years
it's all imaginary
the entire thing that we
imagine is real it's just a bunch of
imaginary elements that were
were mentally
moving around in our heads
tds tells us of weakness it does
being offended is the name of my anger
sword
calling a short man an elephant is not
offensive to you not offensive
it's disqualifying
being
disqualifying is different from offenses
i think that a national leader
should not target citizens who are
part of the country
for any reason
so it's not so much about being
offensive it's about can you have a
leader
who thinks that some people are worth
less than other people
it's just that attitude you don't want
to have in charge
um
yeah
elf is descriptive
well i didn't say i was oh you mean that
he looks like an elf well do you think
anybody would be calling fauci and elf
if he were six foot five
be real
if fauci were over six feet tall he
would be called a vulcan
you know he would because they'd say oh
he's got pointy ears or something looks
like a vulcan no it's because he's short
that they call him an elf let's let's be
realistic
you don't go to elf
unless there's a little shortness going
on
why isn't ukraine in the news because
it's a steady state situation and
they're probably no reporters on the
front line
let me ask you this
if things stay the same who would you
declare the winner in ukraine
or you could say stalemate
if things stay the way they are who's
the winner
some say russia
because they gained more than they lost
right in terms of territory
russia somebody says zolensky
pelosi china biden okay but between
russia and ukraine who won
my definition of winning a war
is if you're the country that got
attacked
you stay intact
that would be winning
the the definition of winning if you're
the attacking country is that you end up
controlling the country
did the united states win in
vietnam
did we
win now we controlled some stuff for a
while
but we never controlled the country
so i'd say we lost i can't think of an
example in the history
where somebody who went in militarily
and did not control the country and had
to leave
have we ever called that a victory
in any other context would we ever say
that was winning
i i feel like
by my definition of winning and losing
ukraine won they won the war
and it looks like to me it looks like
it's basically over
because i don't think the borders are
going to change that much from this
point
now did they lose a lot yes but
everybody loses an ore
you're going to lose people resources
money
and in this case land
so everybody loses in war
but there's still a country
um
why do all newscasters talk with
newscaster voice
part of it is because they need to punch
words
that are not important
so if you haven't seen me do this yet
this is the newscaster trick
you saw this on the movie uh
network
so the newscasters punch words
that don't even make sense to punch
meaning they accentuate them and the
reason is you have to
every now and then
you have to accentuate a word so you've
got some contrast because if you didn't
people would just fall asleep
so you've got to say ukraine
is having some tough time shipping their
wheat
so basically they just punch words
every now and then to keep you
interested so it ends up being that now
if the news were interesting on its own
maybe they don't need to do that so much
right
but because the news tends to be
repetitive
they gotta add a little
little theater to it
how does that compare to a preacher's
cadence
um
preachers tend
yeah i mean they a good preacher is
going to have the same communication
skills so punching words always make
sense
but
here's a little
factoid
when i was learning hypnosis so i was
actually taking a class to be a
hypnotist
our homework was to watch a specific
preacher
to watch him because he was hypnotizing
his the people watching and i would just
watch that it was dr gene
what was his name
you remember him he was really big on tv
a long time ago
dr gene somebody
and he would have white boards and he'd
write his stuff down
dr gene scott
yes this actually happened i
failed to remember the last name of
somebody whose name is my name
that actually happened
all right
but the reason we were asked to watch
him is that his technique was so
hypnotically
powerful
that i could watch that guy for hours i
would just go wow
wow
and
the trick that he used
i've never seen quite used the same way
he would start talking about something
intellectual about the bible it's like
well you didn't know this was connected
to this and back in those days they said
this and this and he starts his story
and you think it's going somewhere
you think there's going to be like a
story with a point
and then it doesn't really go anywhere
it just
transforms into another story
that you think is going somewhere but it
doesn't it just goes to another story
so when you're done you've heard all of
this story
but the only parts that you remember are
the part where where every now and then
he says you have to send them money
because they need money for something
so that all all of the content
uh basically just put you in a
let's say a flexible mood
so when he asked for money you were more
likely to give it
all
right tucker does that somebody says
you know biden's whisper actually works
from a communication standpoint he
doesn't really whisper the important
parts but if he did it would work
because you do pay attention to the
whisper
so it works
all right i don't think i have anything
left is there anything i missed today
anything i should have talked about
uh messages are intended to overload the
subconscious oh let me tell you
something i did
a little test i did with my dog
that is still blowing my mind
i mentioned this before that i saw
somebody on
on instagram say that if you take your
dog for a walk and your dog just wants
to sniff stuff
don't make it walk
because the dog actually doesn't need
any walking
it needs to sniff
the sniffing's actually the part the dog
needed
and the reason is that you know dogs are
sensitive to smell
so when they're smelling a variety of
things that matter to them such as
another dog
their their brain just lights up
so if you let them outside to sniff
around where other dogs have been
they they will exhaust themselves
mentally
and so i took my dog out in the morning
and had her and i didn't walk her like i
just took her to the park and just let
her sniff
so usually i'm like
trying to encourage her to walk so she
has exercise so i didn't do any exercise
except where she wanted to walk on her
own which was lots of places and i just
let her sniff wherever she wanted to
sniff
and then i took her back and she slept
for eight hours
and she's never done that in the middle
of the day
in the middle of day she's usually
pretty active and follows me around and
begs for cheating treats and stuff but i
let her out for
15 minutes of sniffing
and 15 minutes of sniffing just knocked
around cold
and i thought oh my god have i been
spending my whole life with this dog
14 years and i thought she needed to
walk
and she needed to sniff
and i always wondered why she didn't
seem as interested in my backyard
because i have a large backyard with
landscaping and stuff and it's enclosed
so she can go out in a very you know
spacious
you know backyard completely safe
and you know it's artificial turf back
there so she can do her business
wherever she wants
and
there are no other animals
so she goes out and she acts immediately
barred in the backyard
you know she'll run around but there's
nothing to sniff
and
and it doesn't work and i wondered for
years why she wasn't interested in the
backyard
it doesn't have anything to smell
so everything i thought about this dog
was wrong and i find out like probably
the last year of her life because she's
she's at that age
and
i feel really bad about it
but at least i know how to you know give
her what she needs now
so if you're hearing about this for the
first time somebody asked me about
overloading the brain
it's a similar technique in hypnosis
if you can overload somebody's brain
then they're less critical thinking
after they're exhausted
uh bird feeders i do not like birds
i just
birds just are like flying insects to me
i just can't love a bird
all right
so that's all i have
um
that's all i have for now
go be nice to your dogs let them have a
sniff
and youtube i'll talk to you tomorrow
bye
