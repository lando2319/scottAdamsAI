good morning everybody
wow
you are looking good
you know why you look so good
it's because i'm wearing black today
yeah it's true
everybody looks good when i wear black
i think that's the same
uh if you hear something that sounds
like a little bit of fry in the
in the audio that might be the
shower that's running in the room next
to me
in a feat of terrible timing
but it'll be over soon
now
yes i do look great in black you're
right you're right
and
how many people are here for the
simultaneous up
anybody anybody
yeah i thought so
many of you and all you need is a
copyright glass tanker jealous just die
in the canteen jungle flask vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day the
the drink that
supports
the freedom truckers
anybody
who's in favor of the freedom truckers
supporting them
so this is to you freedom truckers i
hope some of you are watching you must
probably don't have a lot to do up there
sitting in your cold cabs
doing the best you can
so here's to you keeping us free
and we'll talk about you a little bit
more go
oh yeah
you know in all the time that the
critics have tried to paint the
the truckers as some kind of a
rebel
right wing thing
even once
did any of the critics think of this pun
it's a bunch it's a bunch of honkies
anybody
nobody thought of that one
all right well i don't want to help them
i don't want to help the other side
but really
nobody in this
there's nobody who thought of that one
at all come on
all right well today's theme
i'm going to call it the demise of the
expert class
am i right or am i wrong
that the most striking part of the last
five years
is the complete demolition
of the credibility of all experts and
everything
i feel like that that alone is the
single biggest change in everything now
experts would include
people giving you the news it wouldn't
yeah we we never trusted the politicians
so that part's not new
but i feel like this is a new thing
and i was i was thinking about the uh
the most natural
path or trajectory i guess
that the civilization would take
and this is sort of off the top of my
head just before i i came on here but i
want to run something by you
to see if there's a predictable place
where this all goes
are you ready
so if you go back in time enough you
would go back to a time when typically
the leader would
tell the people
hey i was chosen by god
and that was how the leader got
credibility i was chosen by god
because it probably was pretty hard to
protect the leader
when nobody had good weapons right it
seems like you could just throw throw a
rock at the leader
and be kind of dangerous
um so they needed some kind of you know
authority beyond
force
but you know then over time people
became more enlightened and
communication got a little better maybe
education got a little better
and we stopped believing that leaders
were chosen by god
for the most part
um
and then you get dictators
because if you don't have that cover
story about god
you need to use force
so you got a lot of dictators
and what happens when you have a lot of
dictators
well as the public
communicates better and over time
communication always keeps improving
right right up to the internet and then
it went boom
so people are getting smarter they're
communicating better and what is the the
logical thing you'd expect when you have
dictators
you end up with revolutions
so dictators lead to revolutions
and then revolutions lead to
something like leaders chosen by the
people
now what do you get when you have
leaders chosen by the people
eventually
the people with the money are in charge
of the leaders
am i wrong
these are just sort of normal things
that follow
dictators
plus educating the public plus
communications
should lead to revolutions
the revolution should give you something
like a
leaders chosen by the people once you
have that
and you've got it plus capitalism
you've got to well maybe you don't even
need the capitalism but you need but
you've got money that's going to control
them all right so now you're going to be
in a situation where money chooses the
leaders
but what was our only protection from
that let's say
in western
democracies
what was our only protection
from being abused by the money people
and the politicians
it was kind of our experts wasn't it
well you could always sort of depend on
well
they can't get away with that much
because our experts will ferret out the
bad behavior
you know the experts in our news
industry we'll find out what crimes they
did
the experts in our financial industry
will keep people from doing bad things
so basically
at least you have the experts watching
things
what happens when the credibility of the
experts just disappears
like what's left
and i feel like we're entering that
territory
so can we predict what happens as surely
as we can predict
that dictators plus education plus
communication
leads to democracies which we can
predict leads to money taking over
which leads to our only protection being
the experts which leads to the experts
being bought off losing their
credibility which leads to now doesn't
all that seem like it was predictable
in hindsight right
it's easy to have hindsight
but
is the next phase predictable
what do you think
if all of those phases were kind of
predictable but really maybe only
because we're looking at it from today's
perspective
but is there something that would be
just as obvious
later that we should have said oh it's
obvious where that's going to go
well let me throw out an idea
you know the two things that made the
experts sort of worthless
is some got bought off but also our our
problems are more complex
you take an expert on some simple
subject
relatively simple such as
do cigarettes cause lung cancer
relatively simple question it took a
while to know for sure but a relatively
simple question
now take climate change
completely different
story right
totally complicated
so we're in a world in which a lot of
our problems you know what is russia and
ukraine gonna do and all the different
economic and military
ways that this could line up
so experts can't predict because things
are too complicated
and they've lost their credibility so
we're kind of lost and
the question is how do you have a trust
free
civilization
a trust free
because we don't have trust anymore we
don't trust experts governments
people with money we don't trust our own
intelligence agencies
we don't trust anybody don't trust the
news and we're not wrong by the way
don't get me wrong the problem is not
that we have less trust
the problem is that we found out we
shouldn't be trusting
it's nothing to do with the public the
public's actually in pretty good shape
the public is you know sort of waking up
to
uh just how bad things
have gotten in terms of uh trust
so here's where i think is the the
obvious only place it can go
transparency
and i think that that will be
like incredibly obvious someday you know
20 years from now
and
fairly soon the only way we're going to
get past this inability to trust anybody
about anything
is to have just massive
sea changes and transparency
now here's the problem
that's also going to have an impact on
your privacy
and here's something i've been
predicting for years that people always
misunderstand
people misunderstand me saying i'm in
favor of what i'm going to predict
i'm not in favor of it
it's irrelevant whether i favor it or
not
i just think it's going to happen
and what's going to happen is the
continuing
evolution
where we trade privacy
for function
for utility
right so every time we give up a little
privacy as long as we're doing it in
some intelligent way
we're getting back some kind of
feature right it makes our smartphones
work better
basically all of our technology
everything that makes life easy
costs us a little bit in terms of our
privacy
but think of all the all the problems
you could solve if you got to a world
where
you didn't have any privacy
stop stop there's something you're all
thinking right now
and i want to stop you from thinking
that
you're thinking of a world in which
people have partial privacy that's
terrible
a world in which the government here's
our world now the government knows more
about you
than you know about the government
how is that fair
that's a big problem
don't you think that you can solve a lot
of problems if you could know as much
about your government as your government
can know about you
right
so if the only change we made is to say
all right it doesn't look like we're
going to get any more privacy back
realistically
but
we could at least make the government
more transparent
right we can make science more
transparent probably in a variety of
ways
i know science needs science
you know the community itself knows it
needs to
fix its credibility problem probably has
lots of good ideas for that by now
so i'm not saying you should give away
your privacy
i'm just saying it's going to happen as
a just a side effect of that here's the
other way that your privacy is going to
completely disappear
ai
right now the only way you can give away
your privacy is
if somebody hacks you or there's a you
know warrant
that they can get into your stuff or you
give it away or something or you're
careless i guess
but what happens when ai can figure out
everything about you
without anybody's permission
if you don't think that's coming
i don't think you know what's coming
you know how an fbi profiler
can look at just a few clues
and know a lot about the the
perpetrator
and it's like it's almost scary how much
they get right
how well do you think
ai is going to do that
once they can find out everything about
you that's public
and
maybe you can find out everything about
you that's not public
i mean if the ai is good enough it'll
just hack any system it needs to look
into
so
at some point ai is going to guarantee
take all of your privacy
but it doesn't mean it's going to
distribute that privacy to anybody who
wants it
but the ai itself will know exactly what
the freak you're doing
it's gonna know before you know
you don't think it can predict you
before you do it you're wrong
it absolutely can predict your your
actions before you do them not every
time but
if somebody had an active social media
account
and it had access to it
yeah
it could it could book i'm sure it could
pick out a shooter
a school shooter
alberta could do that maybe not yet
but you know it's obvious where
everything's going
so i would say that the obvious place
where all this is going is an end of
hidden secrets and there'll be great
transparency
uh going on now let me tell you about a
world in which you lose all of your
privacy
suppose even just the worst
just the worst stuff that ever happened
to you or or they
every like even maybe you're
you know your kinks you're just
everything
just everything you don't want people to
know about let's just say it all went
out there what would happen
well if you were the only person who
gave up your privacy
devastation
everybody who still had their privacy
would mock you into
something bad
but
suppose you could communicate with
anybody in the world and everybody can
see your stuff and you can see everybody
else's stuff
all you'd have to do is find somebody
who had a similarly bad background
you could be best friends
and you could do it instantly so instead
of saying oh i don't want to have a
friend because they'll find out about my
bad background you just get on the
internet and say all right i need
somebody else who's done all these
terrible things or something similar hey
look it turns out a lot of people
a lot of people are just like me
let's get together
so i think you would find
that if you could find out other
people's
you know let's say badness
and they could find out yours you would
just have more friends
and it would be impossible to lock you
all up
because there'd just be too many of them
and here's the best part
if everybody's flaws were on display all
the time
you wouldn't see them anymore
that's not immediately obvious but think
about it if everyone's flaws just their
worst components were just on display
let's say you had ar glasses you know
you where where somebody's information
pops up just because they walked in the
room or maybe you're in the metaverse
and you it's the same thing
and suppose you just know everything
about somebody
you would be so exhausted
by looking at their list of problems
that you would just be snow blind after
a while
do you know what snow blind means
is snow blind one of those things that
only people who grew up in snow know
what it means
basically
you just become blind everything is all
whited out
so
i know i i think the the day that we
start treating our problems like uh
there's stop treating our problems like
they're special
is the day
everybody's got less anxiety and
everybody has more friends and it's
easier to get a job
however there might be no way to get
there without going through the worst
thing that could possibly be
which is the government knows more about
you than you know about them
and that's where we are
so
alright that's my long-range prediction
is massive
transparency is the only way only way
you can have a trust based
economy
the only way you could have a trust
based economy
is massive transparency we don't have
that
all right
but we will it's inevitable
favorite story of the day
uh you know how trump has been
criticized for his let's say his
record-keeping
systems
because some of the
important records from his his
presidency found their way to mar-a-lago
and i guess they're being shipped back
and it's not like the biggest deal in
the world
but we do know that trump is not the
best in how he handles important uh
documents which leads us to this story
uh there's a report
that pages from maggie haberman's book
had been found
flushed papers found in a clogging
clogging trump white house toilets
so
i didn't know maggie haven't had a book
until i learned that his pages were in
trump's
toilet
and i tried to think
if you were the publisher
and and you found out that the only
publicity you've gotten for your book
in a you know in a market that's got a
lot of publicity for a lot of books the
best publicity let's say that you got
for your book was that trump had used it
for possibly toilet paper
the uh
i don't like to be gross but the
the story was a little bit silent on the
question of whether the paper had been
used or just torn from the book and put
directly in the toilet i think that's an
important detail
uh
that might just be me
but
i i think this is like the best
this would be the ultimate test
of all publicity is good publicity
you know
you always wonder where
these little common sense rules like all
publicity is good publicity
you always wonder where
where the limit of that
common sense is
and i think if
if the president
if the president of the united states
used the pages of your book to wipe his
ass
that might be the limit
of where publicity
just turns bad
oh speaking of bad publicity
uh
you know we live in a world of you know
massive uh character assassination as
you know
and uh
do you know what happens if somebody who
doesn't know anything about me
you know me personally
somebody doesn't know anything about me
finds out about me for the first time by
reading stuff on the internet about
[Laughter]
me do you have any idea what happens
because i heard about this recently
somebody who wasn't aware of dilbert you
know wasn't aware of yeah any books i've
written anything i've done on livestream
wasn't aware of anything
just went to the internet to find out
because you know my name came up went to
the internet to learn about me
let me just say the word horrifying
doesn't cover it
[Laughter]
well have i ever taught you that
i think i say it too often
that freedom from embarrassment is like
a superpower
because
i'm not sure the rest of you could even
survive this
but to me it's hilarious yeah at first
it was horrifying to me too like my
first reaction was oh my god
if you didn't know anything about me
that's the the first thing you'd learn
and basically none of it is true
and
and uh but the more i thought about it
the more the funnier it is that there's
a just like this complete you know
caricature of me now this is of course
in the context of watching what's
happening to joe rogan because you can't
really do a live stream today without
talking about joe rogan's problems
and uh
watching cnn run a uh
a hit piece on him today
there was just so messed up i mean just
just completely messed up
uh yeah i'm not even gonna criticize it
it was so it was just so messed up
that uh
you think what a world what a world we
live in where
i you know is joe rogan trying to make
the world worse for anybody
what did he do to you
did he run over your dog
what we're suddenly hating on him like
like that matters
he's probably the least
offensive if you think about it he might
be the least offensive person in the
public realm
think about it
if you were really serious about it and
you really you know had watched enough
of his content he might be the least
offensive person in the entire
public realm because remember
everybody's offensive to somebody
everybody it doesn't matter if you're on
the right at the left you're offensive
to somebody
so but within the list of people who are
offensive which is everybody
i'd put him pretty near the bottom
now that video that came out about
repeated use of the n-word
i feel like we need an exception
and i i would say
i'm of course not the person who can ask
for this
but
on behalf of the well not on behalf of
but would the black community agree with
this standard
that comedians should be able to use any
word
if they're talking about the word
not if they're using in you know a
direct offensive way of course
but
could we agree
that
stand-up comics and somebody who does
that for a living
could just be the exception
that that's that's the one class of
people that we say all right all right
we get it your job
that's your job your job is to is to
challenge us with words
if your actual job
is to challenge people's thinking with
words
let them use all the words
and let them be the exception
now again i'm not saying an exception if
they use the word in the direct
insulting way but nobody ever accused
joe rogan of that am i right nobody even
accused him of that
in my mind the problem is with the
people who think uh stand-up comics or
somebody who's even doing a live stream
within the context of being a stand-up
comic that's the same thing i'd say
to say that that specific kind of
occupation
should be treated like all the rest is
just nonsense
am i wrong
you know if
i do think that
if somebody you know some other
podcaster who was not known to be a
comic
if that person had a compilation of
using that word in any context
i'd have some questions
wouldn't you
like you'd want to know more about that
context but if you hear that a comic
a professional comic
use the words and the one thing you know
is that nobody nobody accuses of using
the words in an insulting way nobody
that's not even that's not even in the
conversation
why are we even talking about it
he's the one exception
i mean comics are the one exception now
i would not put myself in that category
um
you know i think you'd have to be a
i would say if you're a professional
stand-up comic
you just got to have different rules
it just ought to be that way
for everybody's benefit really
well let's talk about the trucker
rebellion
ezra levant had a uh
interesting thread in which he has a
prediction that the way this will get
resolved
is that biden will go first in dropping
vaccine mandates for border crossings
and then it will make it a little bit
absurd
if if the border only works in one
direction
you can go one way with a vaccination
but not the other you're without the
vaccination but on there
so and i think that's a reasonably good
um
good prediction i do think that if it's
between biden and trudeau biden would
probably go first if if it's going to go
at all
so that's a pretty good prediction i'll
put that out there see how he does
all right um on our theme of the
destruction of the expert class i would
like to read to you a tweet
about the trucker convoy
from somebody who's a who has a phd and
is a professor
so based on the bio it's a phd and a
professor
and uh this
phd and professor he's a professor of
social political philosophy
now you have to be pretty smart
and have you know a lot of credentials
to be that kind of a professor right
most kind of professors but
philosophy tends to be high iq people so
almost certainly a very smart person
and in his bio he says he's not afraid
to dig deeper i deal with causes and all
symptoms
uh we need intelligent dialogue not
partisan uh cliquishness and i'm
thinking this this guy sounds pretty
good uh lots of good credentials phd
and he tweets this today he says realize
that the trucker convoy and copycat
demonstrations are not about vaccines
they aren't about freedom they are
classic reactionary tactics to disrupt
society and force it toward a return to
right-wing power
john
i just realized i've never said this
word out loud
uh hegemonies
hegemonies right
hegemonies
that are the end freedoms open inquiry
and ruled laws in other words the
truckers
say this one very intelligent professor
yeah he believes it's really uh classic
reactionary tactics
to disrupt society it is disrupting
society so that part is true
but to force it toward a return to
right-wing power
hegemonies the end freedoms open inquiry
and rule of law
in what universe
in what universe are the political right
associated with less freedom
[Laughter]
less open inquiry
what
and less rule of law
that literally the the three pillars
probably the three pillars of the right
of the right would be these three things
more freedom
more freedom of speech which i think the
open inquiry gets to that and more rule
of law
these are literally exactly the three
things the right wants not the three
things the right wants to get rid of
how the hell do you get a phd and say
stuff like this in public
am i wrong
am i wrong that this is literally
ridiculous
so this is just more evidence of the
complete destruction of the
um
of the expert class if you missed it
he's a professor of social and political
philosophy
and you know i'm not i'm not even making
fun of him as an individual so don't get
this wrong
this is not about an individual
this is about the destruction of the
expert class how in the world do you get
a phd
and then put out a tweet like that
i know or am i wrong
maybe the tweet makes sense and we're
all stupid i guess that's the other
possibility
given that we know he's got a high iq
or i thought he did
all right um
so
what do you think about natural
infection
uh protecting against govid versus the
vaccines well there's a new paper
brought to my attention by uh dr john
mandrella on twitter
and uh
the new paper
basically it's a stronger evidence
because it's a fairly strong paper in a
good publication
and it says that natural infection
protects you against severe illness
which
basically
takes almost all everything out of the
argument that especially young people
should have mandatory vaccines for
college and hospitals since we know or
the boosters
mandatory boosters
so it doesn't make sense to boost
somebody who has natural immunity
if uh the booster itself we know could
be a risk but the natural immunity has
already done what the booster is going
to do
now
isn't this yet another example of a
destruction of the expert class
that we're listening to our experts and
don't you and i and obviously dr
mandrella
don't we all find this obvious
i feel like it's pretty obvious
that
at this point natural infection should
be a perfect substitute for any kind of
vaccine
mandate but the bigger question of
course is why i have a mandate at all
at this point all right
and here's another question
um suppose other doctors like dr
mandrella would have the same opinion
which is that
for at least for young people i will
limit it to young people and limit it to
the question of boosters
um suppose your doctor told you that was
a bad idea
but your college or your hospital
employer
told you you had to do it
how do you handle that ethically
if you're an employer and you ask your
employee to do something that your
doctor says is against
good medical advice
what what is the
where does that go like how do you
adjudicate that
like who who wins that
i don't even know where that goes would
that go
is that even a
was there any kind of a law that is
broken
you get a medical exemption oh okay
so i guess the law does handle that you
get a medical exemption
but
wouldn't everybody have the medical
exemption
so couldn't you get a medical exemption
to the mandates just by saying that
you're
you have a prior infection
so give me a fact check on this
wouldn't that tell you that the mandates
are already unnecessary if you're
infected because you could just get a
medical exemption
so that would suggest that the mandates
are not really enforceable to anybody
who's been infected
if they wanted to get a medical
exemption
right oh so i guess i don't know enough
about this story
so may maybe it's a less of an issue
than i think except for that extra step
that seems
maybe the only way you can be sure that
somebody has the
the prior infection
i don't know if you believe just the
test by itself anyway
um
so maybe that's uh maybe we need to know
more about that all right so in the
category of everything is racist and
we're going to mix this with the the dog
that doesn't bite
or does the dog that's not barking
so i look how much do you love dogs not
barking stories
i i feel like they're fascinating but i
might be wrong the dog not barking is
the the story that should be in the news
but for some reason it isn't
they always tell you something right
all right here's one
in a context
and i think you would agree this is our
context where everything is called
racist
am i right
that there's no story that doesn't have
a racist element to it
just always
if you had a story
that conspicuously was missing the most
obvious racist accusation
what would that tell you
well it would tell you that your media
is probably manipulated but i guess you
knew that
so here's one that
i think
if you haven't heard this before
it's going to blow your mind that the
dog is not barking
and here it is i tweeted it earlier
that inflation is a stealth form of
systemic racism
inflation
inflation is systemic racism
in the context that everything is racism
but the argument applies
and i'm not being like overly clever or
anything i think it applies directly
because when you have inflation who does
it hit
inflation hits hardest low income people
which are
unfortunately
over overpopulated by
people of color
so
because the rich you know they're also
going to take a hit right i'm not saying
inflation only goes after
low income but the rich at least have
some escapes right there their assets
that they own will will increase with
inflation
so even though your stuff costs more
your house is becoming more so there's
some balance there
but you know low income people don't own
a house to inflate
the rich can repay their existing loans
with cheaper dollars because inflation
makes the amount you borrowed seem like
it's less and less every year
and who borrows money well it's not low
income people
low income people don't have credit they
can't borrow anything so it's only the
high income people who get this benefit
and then the high income people are more
likely to own a business and be able to
you know pass along price increases
but low income people don't own any
businesses and they can't pass along any
price increases not easily anyway i mean
i suppose they could negotiate for a pay
raise
so here's the dog not barking
if if
most of the inflation had been created
by a republican
a republican decision or set of
decisions
wouldn't we be talking about them being
inflation being racist all day long
we would right
we would be saying all day long those
darn republicans
gave us a bunch of inflation and that's
racist
we would
so
um
and to me the inflation might be our
biggest remaining problem
i think because i think a lot of our
other big problems are now
you know at least we have a solution
that looks like it's forming for
everything but not inflation
you know unless you just think we'll top
it down that's that's the only solution
maybe it is just tough it out
but
i don't know i'm just amazed that we're
not making a big stink about it being
racist it has to be just because the
democrats
control the media all right
uh give me a fact check on this but i
thought i heard the director of the cdc
yesterday say
that they don't recommend
basque mandates
am i right
that the cdd cdc does no longer
recommend a mask i don't know if they
ever did
but
um
they're now saying masking where the
local people think it makes sense
but i i thought yesterday i was hearing
that the cdc was still
pro mask
do i have this wrong
yeah i thought the cdc said keep using
masks
where there are high infection rates
but that that would be sort of a local
decision what a high infection rate is
so to me it sounds like the cdc already
took themselves out of the game
because are they not saying
use your mass where the infection rate
is high but they're not telling you what
is high
therefore it's they're not telling you
what to do
they're basically saying use their own
judgment right
all right
no i i saw the director of the cdc say
that
they're only recommending them where the
infections are high
um she stated the states
the states trump the cdc that's correct
okay
so the cdc is no longer part of the
question is now a purely political
question even more than it is
you know anything else
and i think at this point that the
burden of proof
for masking
has to be required
if you've watched me for a while you
know that
i treated the beginning of the pandemic
like a risk management in
in the fog of war
now in the fog of war you do everything
that might possibly make a difference
if you can you just do everything
and then later
as you get more data you refine your
method
based on what you've learned so you
don't make the same decisions in the
beginning as you make in the end but
likewise
where i would not have required my
government to give me really really good
evidence that masks work
when when things were hot and fresh and
we didn't know as much
i do now
i do now
i really require it now and if they
don't have a study that's omicron only
then they don't have a study am i right
anything that hasn't tested masks in the
real world
with omicron
with vaccinations
with whatever scenario we want the
public to go to if we haven't tested
that
there is no data
that's applicable to the situation
if there is no data to suggest that they
work
you're taking our freedom and you're not
giving us any reason
right
now
i want to be really careful how i slice
this
it is my opinion that masks do work
sorry
and that that's an engineering decision
based on the fact that uh a direct plume
in your mouth when i'm talking to you
has got to be worse
than coming out of the side of my masks
and you know maybe entering the room
but the viral load would be completely
different now
is that difference
a one percent difference
a ten percent difference well i'll tell
you what it's not
it's not a fifty percent difference am i
right
let me see where i can get you to agree
we would all agree it's not a 100
difference
right
mass we would all agree it's not a 50
percent difference because you would see
that so easily in the data
we would all agree i think it's not a 20
difference
so far
everybody on board it's definitely not a
20 difference because you would see that
that would be too big even with the
other confounding variables i feel like
you'd see that
so how about 10
well now now maybe some opinions will
start to differ right
maybe 10
well
if you can't prove that it's 10
or 1 percent
i i think that's where personal choice
personal freedom
personal responsibilities start to
kick in as the dominant factors right
in the
in the realm of omicron and the realm of
highly vaccinated and highly already
infected et cetera so i think that the
burden of proof has gone from you don't
need any proof at all
in the fog of war
to you better fricking prove it right
so
so the public's requirement for proof
should be sky high right now
because right now we're cl we're in what
i call the great claw back
where much of our freedom has been taken
from us
voluntarily in many cases voluntarily
but we got to get it back and
governments are bad at giving back good
taking
so we're clawing it back
and during the claw back period you're
going to have to prove that masks are
making more than a one percent
difference because if the best you can
do is that you're pretty sure they make
a difference
i'm sorry that's not good enough
because
you still have to balance that against
you know all of your rights and freedoms
and other mental issues and everything
else so if you can't tell us that it's
above that line
whatever whatever line psychologically
you say to yourself well i get that it
makes a difference
but it might be such a small difference
that
i'd rather not do it
yeah so
here's what i would say about mass if
you're listening to scientists about
whether they ma they work you're
listening to the wrong profession
if you're listening to
anybody who's not an engineer
you're probably listening to the wrong
profession
and it's because it's an engineering
problem not a science problem
and the engineer would say can i blow
out a candle with a mask on
yes or no nope
that means that it is blocking the
forward motion of something
is it coming out the sides can i measure
that yes
do we know the viral load makes a
difference yes
is the viral load going directly into
somebody's mouth
if i don't have a mask in many cases yes
would it be better to put the viral load
in different directions
yes
if you ask the scientist you know what
they say
well this is the size of a virus
and this is the size of a water molecule
and this is the size of the mask holes
and it's all the wrong questions
if you talk to a scientist they will
continually ask the wrong questions and
give you the wrong result you got to ask
an engineer
who are you going to ask if your dam is
going to collapse
i hate analogies too but
a dam is a little bit like a mask in the
sense that it's not so much a science
question is it
there was certainly science at some
phase of you know developing the tools
that could build the dam
but at some point the handoff happens
it's just an engineering question so i'm
not going to talk to my scientist about
whether my dam is well engineered and
i'm not going to talk to a scientist
about whether the mask is stopping my
spittle from hitting somebody in the
face
it's just the wrong profession
all
right i'm exaggerating a little bit
there
um have you noticed how often you can
fight fire with fire
literally
if you have a forest fire sometimes you
burn the area where it's heading but you
do a controlled burn so when the real
fire gets there it can't cross because
there's no fuel
but you haven't made things worse
because you controlled the burn you did
called fighting fire with fire
well we saw that i think omicron is what
killed delta right
the only thing that killed the virus was
another virus
in the end i mean
everything helped the vaccinations
probably probably some of the stuff we
did help but in the end i think it was a
virus that killed the virus and probably
that's the only way it ever happens
here's another example where i think
this could happen
we're talking about the fentanyl
problem
so we're looking at okay is it the
problem of the addict
yes in the sense that personal
responsibility requires the addict
to be less of an addict
but they don't want to
so we also have a free world where you
know they don't want to in many cases
um
then you could blame the
mexican cartels but it turns out we
can't do much about them because the
government is
basically owned by the cartels in mexico
so we're sort of politically you know
we're sort of trapped
now we'd like to do something about
china but apparently the problem with
china is that even though china has
changed the laws
to make it a top offense to sell these
precursors
to the cartels who then turn it into
fentanyl and then give it to americans
that the chinese makers of the
precursors
can just keep moving back a level
and either finding a different precursor
or something that's a precursor to the
precursor
so they keep finding all these
workarounds where no matter what they
specifically make illegal there's always
something they can ship that's just as
good
that's not yet covered that's where we
are so far
now i say to myself you tell me are you
telling me that the government of china
can't stop that
no that's ridiculous
the government of
china
the government of china
uh could stop anything
because they know the name of the person
doing it they literally we gave it to
them the united states actually gave
them the name of the person who's doing
it the main person
and we just said
stop this guy
and then they didn't do it apparently
so
uh and i was just reading an article
about where do you find the solution
like what's what's the base problem
because you've got the attic themselves
you've got you know the border crossing
the cartels you've got mexico too many
moving parts and here's my suggestion
the only way you're going to end
fentanyl
is with a better drug
you nee you need the omicron that kills
the delta
and we have
i think
we have
the omicron that kills the delta
there is a drug that kills fentanyl do
you know what it is
mushrooms
mushrooms
do seem to have a strong indication
that they can stop addiction
and not i'm not limiting it to fentanyl
i'm talking about alcohol cigarettes
all kinds of addiction
now that knowledge is slowly becoming
mainstream knowledge to the point where
mushrooms are being legalized in some
limited context but i feel like
in the same way that climate change
turned nuclear energy from the dirtiest
thing in the world to the cleanest
you notice that right
the thing that made nuclear go from hey
that's the worst thing we could ever do
to that's the only thing that's good
the only thing that's going to save us
is climate change which had really in
the beginning it didn't seem to have
anything to do with nuclear
power but it became the overriding thing
as the number of as the number of
overdoses
approaches a hundred thousand a year
that's where we're heading i think uh
fentanyl is already 64 000 of it but
overdoses in general are around a
hundred thousand a year in the united
states
that big problem
is going to make mushrooms legal
it's going to accelerate that because as
soon as you get a few studies it shows
it works and i think that's what now of
course if it doesn't work
we would hope science finds that out
quickly and you know we don't have we
don't have some kind of a
problem where people are just doing more
drugs
so this is all contingent on this
actually
panning out scientifically but i'll tell
you everything i've heard
everything i've heard in every form
is universally positive
everything
there's nothing that indicates the
opposite direction at all
so
i propose to you ladies and gentlemen
that fentanyl has met its omicron
it knows its name
but omicron has not visited its house
yet
and if we ever get serious about uh
stopping
addiction
which is really the only way to survive
against china in the future
meaning the competition among nations
the only way the united states and a lot
of western countries will be able to
compete in the future is to get it get a
grip on addiction
remember what naval ravikent once said
ravikant
uh i almost got i almost got demonetized
there by mispronouncing his name
um
i believe he said something in nature
that the the future biggest challenge
will be addiction
that once everybody can get anything
that's sort of the case you can you can
get your video game your cigarettes your
everything you can get any kind of
addiction you want how you manage your
addiction
will be the the primary factor of
success
in a way it never used to be
and so
unless the united states thinks
seriously of some kind of a moonshot
against addiction all of it
all of the addictions unless it doesn't
moonshot against addiction
we can't compete in the future
and we do probably have the tool already
we just have to get past the stigma
so in the same way that climate change
just dragged us past the stigma with
nuclear power
i think the addiction and overdose
deaths are just going to grab us by the
neck and drag us past
our objections with
whatever objections are with psilocybin
and mushrooms and such now i'm not
saying mushrooms are specifically the
answer because there there are other
psychedelics that seem to have the same
effect
but um we do have i think we have the
solution
so let's omicron that delta up
we heard some more about bob saget the
cause of death apparently was a
unexplained bump on the head
they think that he just went to bed
without thinking he was serious and then
he had a brain bleed and tragically
died at night
the only thing i would add to this story
and i was surprised it wasn't in the
story itself
is that a head injury that bad
makes you tired
did you know that
like you you'll barely be able to stay
awake
so
he may have had no choice
it may not have been as much a decision
as
you know if he was already his pajamas
he may have just said oh i could barely
make it to the bed i mean it could have
been one of those situations i'm just
speculating but it was left out of the
story that a head injury
might have been so bad that he didn't he
didn't have the option of thinking
clearly and
and getting help
all right
um
that
ladies and gentlemen
is almost the end of my program
i would like to propose one other thing
which i've noticed and i'm not sure
this pattern holds
because there are probably exceptions to
it
let me ask you
would it be true that
republican policies
with one exception that i can think of
no actually not
you could argue to both ways the
republican policies almost always
increase your freedom
and democrat policies almost always
decrease your freedom
now
immediately i thought of abortion and i
thought oh maybe somebody's gonna say
that's an exception because it's making
something illegal that a lot of adults
want but if you included the
uh if you included the well-being of the
fetus
well then you would be giving freedom to
the fetus
the freedom of life
whereas if you take away the fetus's
option of being born so i guess you
could argue that as a increase in
freedom as well
you know you could argue against it but
there's a strong argument that it's an
increase in freedom
but am i am i right that that pattern
holds
or am i just you know too much
too much influence by my audience at
this point
you know if you think about um
everything from mandates you know the
mandates
take away of freedom
but i suppose the democrats could argue
it's giving other people the freedom
freedom to not be infected
i don't know it's not a clean argument
because you can make an argument of
freedom on almost every side of
everything can't you
but
but my overall feeling is that the
republicans tend to be biased toward
freedom
and the democrats seem to be biased
toward protection
or bias toward not even protection
uh
uh equal outcomes or something i'm not
sure what yeah
but you know republicans are pretty
biased toward safety
because that's what law and order is
that's what strong military is that's
those that's a bias towards safety
so it's just a different bias towards
safety
equity you think equity is a better word
yeah it's maybe freedom versus equity
freedom requires a lack of equity
doesn't it
like i don't know if require is the
right word but you can't you never have
one without it
you could never have freedom without
massive inequity
i don't think you could because part of
freedom is that some people would choose
not to go get stuff
right the whole point of freedom is you
get to decide what to do
some people would decide to start a
business and become billionaires
and other people would decide not to
or wouldn't have the capability i
suppose
more likely
all right
um i'm pretty sure
that's what i wanted to say today
and
i dare say
one of the most useful
and productive live streams
in the history
of civilization
i don't think i've
put too much hyperbole on that that
feels just about right
and now
without further ado
youtube i will see you tomorrow
great talking to you
