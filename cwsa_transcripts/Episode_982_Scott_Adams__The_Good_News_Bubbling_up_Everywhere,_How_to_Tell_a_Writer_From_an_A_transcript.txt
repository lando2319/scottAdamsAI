hey everybody come on in
yeah you found it it's time
congratulations
good work so far
so far your monday is looking good you
found coffee with scott adams
did you hear the news
well not news in 2012 there was a study
that musicians brains actually sync up
during a duet
if you look at their brains you find
that they actually get in sync
and interestingly
even before the music starts their
brains sync up
so there's actually a physical
known
let's say matching within the physical
structure of brains
prior to singing
and i believe this connection
is very important for humanity
we will now connect
sonically in a very similar way
because you know it's coming next don't
you
already your brain is syncing up those
of you who have joined me before
feel it yeah your brain is syncing up
with mine right now
because you know what comes next
here it comes
all you need is a cover a mug or a glass
of tanker challengers nine a canteen
jugger flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better including the damn
pandemic
it's called the simultaneous sip
it comes with synchronicity it comes
with
simultaneous vibrations in our brain go
did you feel that
i can feel that
yeah i can feel that
all right
well it's a funny day today's a funny
day
i'm gonna be optimistic today
okay with you
it's all gonna be good news today
i'm sure there's bad news
well i'm sure there's bad news
all over the world but today
today we're gonna wrap ourselves in a a
little monday
blanket of good thoughts
number one good thought comes from
naval ravicant
who tweeted yesterday
and i quote
i love america greatest country on earth
only place that will completely accept
you even if you weren't born there
the reason i mention that is that this
would be a really good time
to remind ourselves
that there's something about america
that's just not like other places
we are not a collection of
people so much
as a collection of shared ideas
and it is indeed true if you share those
ideas you play by the rules you follow
the laws you
you follow the constitution you think
that's a pretty good deal
america completely accepts you
and we should remember that because when
2021 comes
and we start to rebuild
to make america great
again
which has never been so much
we should remember who we are and who we
are is a group of people who are here by
choice
not every one of you you know was born
where you wanted to be born necessarily
but
people who came to america all came here
by choice
except for the well i guess everybody
ultimately came here by choice
if you go way back
and
there is something about
that self-selection process
so
you know even though america is not
about the people so much as it is about
the ideas and the shared values
it is nonetheless true that those shared
values
became a filter
and if filtered
and has for hundreds of years
who it is who comes to this country
and we now have the most
optimistic capable
rule violating
because we're americans too we like to
violate our rules sometimes
because we are rebellious by nature
but but remember who we are
just remember who we are now if you're
if you're listening this from another
country
feel free to substitute what's great
about your country into this
conversation
because
it's time to stop hunkering down
it's time to get off of defense
against this coronavirus it's happening
everywhere states are going back on
offense
they're
they're going right at it
and i would like to make a suggestion
for the country this this would work for
the world as well but for the united st
uh coronavirus deaths
as one number
and break it into two
maybe the second number is people over
70 or maybe it's just nursing home
deaths
but we should stop tracking the nursing
home deaths
with the total deaths
the reason is it's time to get back to
work
the time to be scared
is over
the time to be smart
starts now
scared is good
scared makes you do what you got to do
scared makes you put on your mask scared
makes you stay home scared had his
purpose
you know there was a reason for scared
but now it's a reason to rebuild
time to rebuild
do you want to rebuild scared
nope don't want to it's time to it's
time to change the way we report and
talk about the deaths
so that we put them back into a smarter
frame
let's take it out of the scary frame
scary was good
let's no criticism there
let's just scare everybody
that was exactly what we needed to do
now we need to rebuild
i've told you many times an economy is a
set of psychological
states that people act out if you get
your psychology right
your economy is right
step one
to get our psychology right
is let's stop counting the number of
nursing home deaths
because those are not the deaths that
matter to reopening the economy
if we're smart
because we now know that that's where
the weakness is we can wall off that
group of citizens
send the young people back to work but
please
please united states
show us just the stats for the people
who are going back to work
that's the death rate i care about for
the economic purposes
of course i care about all the deaths
let's not let's not be that person
but let's let's put an optimistic
economically compatible
tweak on the numbers and let's just grow
up a little bit and say all right we
have two problems not one
two problems one problem is the comorbid
comorbidity people the people have
higher risk and the other problem is
opening the economy and we should just
track them separately
just track them separately it will be
great for the
psychological being of the country
uh i would like to uh give you some more
uh
cause for optimism
uh
i predicted on twitter this morning that
2021 will be more than a recovery year
2021 will also be a recovery year
but i think it's going to be bigger than
that
like
really bigger than that
and you can almost feel it can't you
today i saw the news that kim kardashian
launched a line of face masks
so while some of us were hiding
kim kardashian launched a new business
now i think she may be giving a lot of
it away i don't know if she's even doing
it for money she may be doing it just
for patriotic reasons which would be
terrific
but
there are a lot of entrepreneurs who are
spring-loaded right now and saying
you know let me get out of the house let
me do something because i got an idea
and here are the bigger trends that are
going to push this entrepreneurial wave
which i think will be the biggest wave
of entrepreneurial energy
the world has ever seen
starting in 2021 i think that everything
you've ever assumed
about
entrepreneurial anything
is just going to be thrown out the door
in 2021 and you're going to see a a
surge of energy
uh in the into the economy that will be
historically unprecedented
and some of the things driving that are
i just saw a
study that said that 40 of the americans
don't want to buy chinese products
and 78
said they'd be willing to pay more
for products made in this country
compared to made in china
do you know how much stuff
china makes
and 78 of us just said
screw that
i'll pay more
to keep my neighbor employed because how
much did it cost you to have your
neighbor out of work
that wasn't free
you know we used to be able to say well
i got my job
so you know my neighbor lost his
manufacturing job to china but you know
that's my neighbor that's not me
but what did the coronavirus teach you
it taught you that you and your neighbor
are economically connected when your
neighbor ran out of food
who paid for the food
well maybe we just printed money who
knows but ultimately we assume that the
people who are doing all right
have to be the ones
who were paying for the ones who you
know needed some help who else is going
to pay
so the idea that we can just ignore the
fact that you're shipping your
neighbor's job to china
like that's not going to affect you
somehow
i think we just got over that didn't we
didn't we just learned that that that's
not how it works
if your neighbor doesn't have a job
nobody's going to mow that lawn
that's going to come back on you
so there's a psychological thing
happening there's an enormous thing
happening with the supply chain i mean
that part is almost beyond calculation
if you if you only took that one thing
you said all right 2021 will be like
prior years before the coronavirus the
only thing you're going to change is i
don't know bring back the entire supply
chain from china
and that's all you would have to know to
buy stock in this country
right
um
what else is happening
so
those are not the only good things
the other thing that's happening i think
will be more subtle
and i've talked about this how
the coronavirus made everybody in the
united states rethink
everything
it made us rethink how we work travel go
to school how we live with each other
everything and when you rethink
everything
and it's everybody rethinking it it's
the it's the people not just the
entrepreneurs
you've really you've really shaken the
box and you've you've created a whole
bunch of opportunities that in a sense
already existed
but they were invisible to us so as soon
as you the coronavirus kicked up all
these flaws in our system
that we could see them and everybody
could see them and we could all say oh
whoa those flaws were not necessarily so
visible
until we saw this
so there's gonna be a lot of fixing of
flaws and that activity alone
would be enormous but i've also uh if
you saw my periscope last night you know
that i think we're gonna just redo
civilization
because we're waking up to the fact that
we're living in somebody else's
uh
somebody else's world
just briefly from what i said in a
longer form last night
the home that most of us live in if we
if you have a house or even an apartment
situation you're living in something
that was designed
for people who died 100 years ago
even if your home is new
it probably is a legacy design
from the 30s when people lived a certain
way
you know before the internet etc
so what you're going to see is i think
people because of the coronavirus sort
of
resetting the way we're looking at our
world
we saw all the problems that happened
when we had just a little bit of a
wrinkle in it
i think people are going to say wait a
minute
let's just look at this from scratch
what does transportation look like
what does education look like what is
what should it look like
and so there's going to be a lot
happening on that all right
um
i know i had at least one other good
example of that oh cheap energy
we may be entering a
phase where energy
you know either oil will stay low
we've got generation four nuclear that's
you know the us government's doing a lot
with their test sites and stuff they're
trying to iterate up quickly
we may be entering a phase where energy
is just super cheap and what's that do
i mean
how about a phase where interest rates
are zero or negative
we're coming into a world where every
assumption has been wiped away we have
an educated population willing to work
supply chain we're bringing back cheap
energy
zero interest rates and a a president
that just showed us
sometimes if you cut a whole bunch of
regulations you come out better
you will will it help us to know that we
cut a bunch of regulations and it helped
us during the coronavirus i feel like
that's a lesson
that gets into your head and then it's
easier to cut regulations going forward
because you saw that it worked before
and
i think a lot of people also realized
that having a job and a boss is not a
secure situation
you know there were a whole bunch of
people who said well i'm going to wake
up in the morning
go to work
i'll have the boss i'll have a job i'll
have a paycheck
and they just found out
that's not that's not a secure way to
live
at least all the people who lost their
job in the coronavirus so if you put all
this stuff together
you can almost feel it can't you
feel it in the zeitgeist
now let's talk about zeitgeist
so i tweeted
i tweeted that uh yeah i could feel it
in the zeitgeist the 2021 would be a
huge wave of
entrepreneurial energy and some of you
are saying
scott why are you using that german word
what does a zeitgeist mean
well
here's what it means it means
that the feeling that everybody has
collectively that we haven't necessarily
talked about
you know you and i haven't had a
conversation about it but there's just
something in the air we're feeling at
the same time our thoughts are sort of
collectively moving in a similar
direction but we don't know exactly why
it's not because we coordinated it's
just the there's just something in the
air that's what the zeitgeist is so
there's no american word for that
now i promised you uh
i promised you in the title to this that
i would help you
determine the difference it's a subtle
difference
sometimes they look similar
but i'm going to help you
identify the subtle difference between a
professional writer
and an
because they can look pretty similar
well let's see let's be honest
and here's the difference this is one
way to tell it's not the only way to
tell it's a bigger topic but here's one
way to tell
if your if your writer uses a word like
zeitgeist
you have to ask why they're using it
now when i used it in a tweet
a tweet is a small bit of you know text
and my intention was
that people would have one of two
reactions
one they would know what the word meant
and they would feel smart because they
know other people don't know what it
means
if you want people to feel smart
use a word that you know they know what
it means but they also know other people
don't don't know what it means they'll
make them feel smarter but what about
the people who don't know what it means
so i'm a professional writer and i put
out a word
in a tweet
that i knew
75 percent 80 percent maybe 90 percent
of the readers wouldn't know what the
word is is that good writing
or is that just being an
well i would propose this
that if the reason your professional
writer used an unfamiliar word is to
make you stop
and think about it and maybe even look
it up
then that's good writing
that's what i did so i used the word
that i knew a lot of people wouldn't
understand because i wanted him to stop
and say what the hell is that zeitgeist
why is he using that word
now here's the beauty of it the way i
used it you didn't know you didn't need
to know what it meant
because the context told you i'm just
saying it's going to be good in 2021 a
lot of energy
but you probably stopped
on the word if you didn't know what it
meant that's what i wanted you to do if
i could make you stop
and pause and think a little extra about
my point then my point becomes part of
your memory in a way it would not have
if i'd used ordinary words
so if you're a professional writer
and you know that what you're trying to
do is make your reader stop
and think that's the right way to use an
unusual word
had i used that same word in a longer
paragraph without explaining it
probably a mistake
because the reader wants to get through
the paragraph they don't want to stop
nobody wants to have to stop and look up
words in a long form
so in that context you don't want to use
weird words which brings me to
the funniest story of the day
that was all all of that was just a
setup
for the funniest story of the day
this is brought to us courtesy of joel
joel pollock at breitbart
who did the hard work of actually
reporting on something
and
and when
it's really the funniest thing of the
day
so you heard that the obama
administration
left behind this 69 page
pandemic planning document
so good job obama right
you got that got that big old planning
document
so
apparently nobody except joel pollock
thought it would be a good idea to
actually look at it
to actually look at it and say
is this is this planning pandemic as
good as we thought it was
well here's where it gets interesting
and
i was laughing for i think i laughed for
15 minutes straight
after i'd read jules article about this
planning document and then i went back
and read the title of joel's
article which is
the obama biden pandemic playbook is
less than advertised
now
that title won't make you laugh until
you read the article but when you when
you appreciate the
the understatement of less than
advertised
tell you nothing's ever been less than
advertised than this this freaking thing
all right so so i won't be able to fully
describe
how useless this document is but i'll
just give you a flavor of it from from
jules
from joel's article
and let me put it in context
remember the story about the russian
troll farm that was influencing our
elections with their their super kgb
russian troll memes that no doubt were
moving moving results and you're
thinking my god
the russians they're weaponizing their
weaponizing memes you know what have
they done they've probably got a secret
laboratory and they're you know they're
they're testing it on people to see
which of the memes are the good ones
you know they've really probably studied
this and weaponized it my god what kind
of memes are they sending us
and then you look at their memes
and it literally looks like it was a
sixth grade class project
children
take out your crayons
and we're going to make memes today
make one that says hillary clinton is
mean
make one that says she lies
all right thank you children
and when you actually look at the memes
you just have to laugh
because you realize the entire story
about the russia troll farm was all fake
maybe not fake ins in the sense that
they actually did these things i'm not
saying they didn't do the things i'm
saying that when you look at it
it's really a stretch
to say that russia was interfering in
the election
i mean it's the biggest stretch you've
ever stretched
uh it's sort of like you know
pissing in the ocean and
looking to see if the
if the water level rose so
this document the obama biden pandemic
playbook is
as joel pollock says
less than advertised let me tell you
how much less
as joel says of the 69 pages because you
say to yourself wow
that's pretty hefty
69 pages of pandemic playbook wow
but of the 69 pages
only 27 are actually playbook
the first 13 pages are a table of
contents
executive summary and various title
pages
the last 29 pages are appendices
and within the 27 pages of the playbook
only 17 deal with an international
international uh
says on the next page all right
with an actual pandemic i guess
why are my notes out of order yes
um anyway
so there's a uh a quote in there
in which the
first part of the uh
the very first oh here it is
sorry
uh
so here's an actual quote from the guy
this is the very one of the first
sections
i swear to god i'm not making this up
this is actually written down
by a public organization it says this
this rubric capitalized
capitalize r for rubric
this rubric is not intended to serve as
a comprehensive concept of operations or
what
it's not intended to serve as a
as a comprehensive concept of operations
or to replace pre-existing us government
response structures
what
so the pandemic playbook is not a con
comprehensive guide of what to do
i thought that was the whole point
but rather it's a guide to other guides
it's a rubric
now
raise your hand if you know what a
rubric is somebody in the comments
exactly as i said that
the comment appeared on screen what is a
rubric
now let me explain
and bring it all together
the difference between a professional
writer and an
is that if your professional writer used
a word like zeitgeist
in a tweet
the point of it was to make you slow
down and think what does that word mean
if however
you're writing a
69-page pandemic playbook
meant to be read
quickly and efficiently by people during
an emergency
one word you should not use if you're a
professional writer
is a rubric
because nobody knows what the it
means
i have to just look it up i'm a
professional writer i don't know what a
rubric is have you ever used that word
in your whole life
seriously raise your hand if you've ever
used the word rubric in a freaking
sentence
not me
not me
so whoever wrote this was not what i
would call a professional writer because
no professional writer is going to say
this rubric is not intended to serve and
then go on to say it's just a guide to
other guides now here's the fun part
this thing is so poorly written
that you would never use it it's
completely unusable
but here's what it
tried to do
so it tried to be a pointer
to point to all the government entities
that would have a role during a pandemic
here's the fun part
each of those individual
entities
already knew what they were supposed to
do
so
do you think we needed a pandemic
playbook
for all of these entities to do what
they're supposed to do
when each of the entities already knew
what they were supposed to do
i would submit to you that the entire
69-page
pandemic playbook should have been on
one page
and that one page should have said in
the event of an emergency of this type
here's the list of agencies that get
involved each of them know what to do
here are their phone numbers and who's
in charge just so you can coordinate
with each other
one page
the 69 page pandemic playbook
should have been one page and then when
you had that one page done here's what
you should do with it
ball it up into a little ball and then
throw it in the garbage because you
don't need the one page either because
as soon as the
as soon as the came down every one
of those agencies i'm guessing
leapt into action
and told their bosses what they need to
do
and then those bosses went to their
bosses
and told them what to do
because every agency already knew what
to do
if you're telling me that the pandemic
playbook was the key to it all and if
we'd had this there would have been no
chaos you have never lived in the real
world because whoever wrote the pandemic
playbook
and started with the sentence this
rubric
is not your a player in the government
this was clearly the lowest level
probably a political hire
somebody who had an ivy league degree or
something like it and and somebody said
look we don't have any real work for you
can you make us a pandemic playbook and
the person said well what's that because
i don't know just make sure there's a
document so we can say that we've got a
plan
you know just in case
so
you have to read for humor purposes i
swear to god this is just for laughs you
have to go look at it so look at joel's
article i tweeted it you can find it in
my twitter feed or go to breitbart
and and and go to actually the document
itself and look at the text it is so
hilariously useless
and watching biden claim that this is
the magic document is pretty funny all
right
let's see what else we got going on here
we got some fun stuff out of south korea
there was a study of asymptomatic
transmission now
there's still that question how much
asymptomatic transmission is there but i
feel like this
south korean study gives us a pretty
pretty good answer
so there was some a gym where they had a
different a bunch of different classes
and what they found is that in the high
intensity classes where people were
maybe packed in and breathing hard
that there was a high rate of
asymptomatic transmission so i feel like
we can put to rest the question whether
it exists
i i feel like we can say there is a
symptomatic transmission
based on this alone because i would
chose south korea for this stuff
and it's but here's the interesting
thing
there was no transmission in the
less active classes like yoga and
pilates
and there was no transmission in classes
with fewer than five people
that doesn't mean there would never be
but i think this lays it out pretty
clearly
that if you were to say go to your
cubicle and sit there and work
and you're not you know hugging or
touching other people it's going to be
more like taking a yoga or pilates class
and a symptomatic transmission didn't
happen
but if you're you know
in one room sweating and playing
basketball or something and you're above
a certain age probably pretty dangerous
so i think that really to me this put it
in a really stark contrast because it
looks like they did a good job
of the contact tracing and they've got a
good handle on this being asymptomatic
but also the specific situations you've
got to watch out for that's pretty big
deal
the washington post
has this opinion piece
trump is gambling the health of the
nation for his re-election so that's how
the washington post
describes a leader simply doing the job
of a leader
correct me if i'm wrong
but isn't
every leader of every country trying to
put people back to work but safely
is president trump doing anything
different
than every governor of every party and
every leader of every country and all of
their governors everywhere in the world
every single one of them
is doing the same thing they're trying
to figure out this this balance of when
to go back to work and how
but in the washington post opinion
trump is gambling the health of the
nation for his re-election
okay so first of all that's another
mind-reading situation because it
assumes some knowledge of his inner
state
and your your magical knowledge of his
inner mind
is that his inner mind doesn't care
about dead people
he doesn't care but if you live or die
he only cares about his re-election
i would say that's not quite in evidence
another person who says that's not in
evidence
well he doesn't say that but
i've told you you should read nate
silver
he he's totally the best
when it comes to calling out the bs for
other people's let's say statistical
ignorance
and what nate says about the opinion
piece that trump is gambling the health
of the nation for his re-election
nate silver says i continue to doubt the
implication of a certain influential
parcel of the conventional wisdom
that tens or hundreds of thousands of
additional americans dying would be good
for trump's re-election prospects
so
you know nate who i don't believe would
ever identify as republican or
conservative i'm just guessing i don't
know if he said anything in those terms
but
but one does not think he is republican
and even even he's calling on
the washington post
saying uh
basically i'm paraphrasing here but
basically can you explain to me
how you get reelected by killing
hundreds of thousands of your own
citizens what exactly is the strategy
you're suggesting he's pursuing where by
killing lots of citizens he gets more
support can you explain how that works
because it looks to me like
it's just adults making adult decisions
and it's not all pretty
so you so even nate is calling out the
washington
post on that so this is why i'm
appreciating nate silver
he is
i would say consistently
he just goes with what the evidence is
pointing to
and
is rare so it's worth calling out
moderna a tech company says they've got
a chronovirus vaccine that
activated antibodies in all 45
participants but they're one they're one
of 110 vaccine makers
who knows if any of that will
work
um
let's say
so it looks like the current
death count estimate for the united
states is 147
000
by early august
so are we going to get to 200 000 dead
do you think
if we just straight line our it doesn't
look like we're trying to flatten the
curve i'm sorry it doesn't look like
we're trying to drive the curve to zero
it looks like it looks like
not looks like it is
that we're going back to work with a
flat curve we'll be good enough
i think we'd go back to work even with a
slightly rising curve
as long as we didn't think it would
overwhelm hospitals
but if if early august is 147 000 dead
uh we could hit 200 000 by the end of
the year could we not
and have you heard the people who say
it's just the flu
be very active lately
because correct me if i'm wrong but
around the time
that the number of uh estimated deaths
seemed like it would certainly be over a
hundred thousand because we're already
around ninety thousand
once it started once it was clear that
it would exceed a hundred thousand
deaths
did you notice that the just the flu
people started getting quiet
is that my imagination
because i think people
may be moved from hey it's just like the
flu
to okay this isn't the flu
but we still have to open up
it doesn't really might not change your
opinion about reopening
but it might change your opinion about
whether this was a serious thing
um
let's say
what else we got going on well there so
there was that uh whistleblower the
disgruntled
uh
mr bright
b-r-i-g-h-t he's bright
and here's some of the things that he
said so i guess he was on six he was on
cbs
was it 60 minutes i'm not sure
but
let's see if you if you think he's a
disgruntled employee
is he just acting politically
or uh is he just a whistleblower and
he's just right
here are some things which we learned he
said that a january 23rd meeting
he was the only person in the room who
said quote we're going to need vaccines
and diagnostics and drugs it's going to
take a while we need to get started
so
so he was the only person in the room
what room was he in
who else was in that room
was it the guy who wrote the pandemic
playbook probably not was the president
in the room
on january 23rd when he said we need
these vaccines and diagnostics how about
anybody else in the room who also
thought that
was he the only guy was he the hero
so here's the thing look for the hero
story
if your whistleblower has a hero story
i try to tell them
they wouldn't listen to me
does that sound like a whistleblower
or a disgruntled employee
i had the idea
nobody would listen to me in the meeting
as the
creator of dilbert
i appoint myself judge and jury of this
question
and i vote
sounds more like a disgruntled employee
but we're not done that's not a firm
judgment yet
and then bright told nora o'donnell on
60 minutes
that his resistance to trump's push for
hydroxychloroquine was what you know got
him fired
and then he put it this way quote
the whistleblower did
i believe my last ditch effort to
protect americans from that drug
to protect us from hydroxychloroquine
was the final straw that they used and
beliefs was essential to push me out
he was trying to protect the american
people
from a drug that is widely used in other
countries
successfully
he's a hero
he's trying to protect us from the drug
that's widely used in other countries
successfully
now when i say successfully
i mean they're not reporting any
problems and they continue to use it
so they must think it's working
because who would still be using it
if it had made no difference
fact check me on this
are are other countries using it more
since this guy said it was dangerous are
or are other countries using it less
because of all the problems and the
people dying from it
i'm going to guess what i'm going to
guess more
wouldn't you
so it seems to me that this guy was just
bad at
risk management
it is it is a fact that if enough people
take this drug somebody's going to have
a bad reaction to die that's just the
fact
it's a fact of drugs in general
and
i'm going to say that he's got a little
bit of a hero thing going on here
i i
i tried to save the americans from that
drug
it was my last ditch effort
i told them they needed protective
equipment
i told them
no one would listen they wouldn't listen
to me
all right um
and then here's the kicker and i will
base my final judgment on this sentence
and by the way
for those of you who have followed me
long enough you know
this is something i've said
before a lot
so this won't be the first time i've
made this kind of interpretation i've
made this judgment
a lot i'll just be consistent
he says quote
we don't yet have a national strategy
stop
stop
what do i say about strategy
what do i say about that employee who
says we don't have a strategy
we don't have a strategy
that employee
is always the disgruntled employee
that's not a whistleblower
a whistleblower is not complaining about
your strategy
that's that's your disgruntled employee
i write i've written about that i've
done this exact joke of the employee who
says i don't have a strategy because
strategy is not even a real thing
there's no such thing as strategy
the strategy is you do whatever makes
sense at the time that you're making a
decision
that's exactly what we did
and guess what
that's pretty much what the pandemic
playbook said you should do too the
pandemic playbook does not say
here's your strategy
because it wouldn't make sense
because every situation is going to be
the new situation you're going to figure
out the situation you're going to figure
out what tools you have you're going to
figure out where it's hitting who's
hitting harder and then you're going to
figure out what to do
is that a
strategy
no it's just you doing what you need to
do because you're in a crisis
the dumbest guy in the room is the guy
complaining you don't have a strategy
that's the person who's operating at the
lowest level of understanding his world
so
if if he's got a hero complex and he's
complaining that the company doesn't
have a strategy
and he doesn't understand risk
management because it wasn't just the
risk that the drug was dangerous
it was also the upside potential that it
made a big difference
he's acting like that part doesn't even
exist so i would say this is a guy who
damn well needed to be fired
uh of course the simulation gives him
the last name of bright
b-r-i-b-r-i-g-h-t and then he
demonstrates that he's not
how perfect is that really
it's like it's like one gift after
another
um
so there's a story about the
inspector general over at the state
department who got fired by trump
uh and the story is he got fired because
he was mike pompeo had been asking one
of his assistants to do some personal
errands
like walking his dog making dinner
reservations and grabbing dry cleaning
a source familiar said
now
do you think that mike pompeo
especially you know during these these
times
which would you rather
would you rather know that mike pompeo
used a political appointee you know
basically somebody who got his job
because he's connected
probably some young person presumably
uh
who probably didn't have much to do
and mike pompeo had a lot to do
so what what is your better world
that mike pompeo sent some political
appointee
young person
to do some personal errands
or do you think mike pompeo should drop
what he's doing and go pick up his own
dry cleaning
which one of those
would you prefer as a citizen mike
pompeo doing his own errands
or mike pompeo you know presumably you
could have as an assistant or something
do it but one assumes that if mike
pompeo had an assistant to do those
errands you would have used that person
right
you have to assume that he didn't have
anybody to do it
or he wouldn't have asked this person to
do it now given the value of mike
pompeo's time and energy
am i as a citizen concerned that he sent
a low-level staffer to walk his dog
make dinner reservations or grab some
dry cleaning
no
thank you mike pompeo for managing your
time correctly because i don't think
you're working a freaking eight to five
job
mike pompeo is not looking at the clock
and saying five o'clock
gonna go home
all right if mom if mike pompeo is not
looking at the clock
and saying i'm going home at five
o'clock and he's staying and he's
working late and he's working late for
you he's working late for me he's
working late for the country yes we can
send a staffer to pick up his
dry cleaning
and
if somebody wants to get him in trouble
and waste my time by trying to
trying to get mike pompeo in trouble
because he wants to work 18 hours today
instead of nine hours
fire that ig
that is the most fired guy i can
ever think of i would fire him
twice if i could fire him really we're
in a gut
we're in a pandemic
and even without the pandemic we got
some stuff to do
all right mike pompeo's got some work to
do
he's got some work to do
inspector general you're so
fired
um that's i'm gonna say this is uh
trump's best fire
this is his best one
yeah there's nobody that he's fired
that's as clean as this one
uh and i i'm even glad that we know why
i'm glad that we know it was because of
this trivial about doing some
private errands you know you
if mike pompeo you tell me mike pompeo
stops work at 5pm
and then i'll tell you mike pompeo needs
to get fired
right but you can't tell me that
tell me these dinner reservations
weren't work
these dinner reservations might have
been work all right
and do we want them to go go to work
with a suit that isn't clean i mean this
is just
it's just
all right let mike pompeo do the work
that he
wants to do for the american people let
them work
all right
apparently uh
according to a marquette law school poll
joe biden still has a commanding lead in
the polls over president trump
the hell is going on
[Laughter]
are our conservatives playing the best
prank of all time on pollsters
is that what's happening
because i'm starting to think that's
what's happening can is there any part
of your brain that can wrap itself
around the fact that biden is leading in
the polls
because there's there's nothing i can
see in the environment that would
suggest that's even slightly possible
now i get how much they hate trump and i
get that maybe biden's just a stand-in
preference
but
i don't think the stock market
has factored into biden president
presidency do you
do do you think the stock market is
expecting uh joe biden to be the next
president
i don't think so
i don't think so
because the market's going one way polls
are going the other way
so i have i hope this is true like there
would be nothing funnier than this if it
turned out later that we could do a poll
of people had been polled
if that's possible so find the people
who had been polled during the year and
just say all right we want to check back
with you were you pranking us
were you really going to vote for biden
you know or something like that and just
find out it was a gigantic conservative
prank you know that 10 of conservatives
were just saying
yeah i kind of like biden
i think i like biden
because you know
you've met conservatives have you not
have you ever met a conservative
do conservatives like practical jokes
yeah they do
they do
they like their practical jokes
uh so i'm going to say that 10 of
conservatives just might be in on a
practical joke that's the only way i
could explain it
um
i love this article making fun of uh
jonah goldberg
i think it was in fox
fox news site and what's funny about it
is that they called them jonah hill the
editor of the dispatch jonah hill is the
actor
so jonah goldberg turned into joni hill
for an article all right uh
so
there's aoc is apparently uh
let's say reframing her green new deal
as
as rather than being a multi-trillion
dollar cost
uh now she's saying to somebody who was
pointing that out
she tweeted hey there uh
totally get it if you've never bothered
to read the legislation meaning the
green new deal
you're commenting so authoritatively on
aoc said the green new deal is a
non-binding resolution of values it does
not have a price tag or cbo score and
costs us zero if passed
what
what
did you always did you always understand
that the green new deal didn't have a
price tag it was just some values
because you know it's weird
i could totally sign on to the values
couldn't you
i mean i'd have to look at them to make
sure that's true but i think the values
if you're saying it's values
wouldn't it be something like
uh
you know we'd like to have cleaner
energy
that would be a value i could i could
sign on to that wouldn't it be we you
know we'd like to uh
keep the water level from rising if we
can understand what's causing it and if
there's anything we could do about it
yeah yeah i'd sign on to that
it if it really is a bunch of values
okay
i don't know somebody says uh
somebody says they don't share the
values well i bet you do what what
exactly would be a value that the green
new deal would be promoting that you
don't favor
if you don't favor the green new deal
it's because you think it's not
practical
or you think it's not affordable or you
think it's not as good as the
alternatives but you don't disagree with
the
concepts
the values
do you are you against
you know clean air and
a sustainable planet and
are you against you know
disadvantaged people doing well
i don't know is there anything you're
against
not values wise
all right uh
and apparently
so remember i told you the zeitgeist is
is looking good for 2021.
so apparently there was a
university of michigan consumer
sentiment reading
that came in better than expected the
index rose in may
up to 74 from 72
in april
so
so the consumer index people's
expectations are actually rising
that's important because remember
direction matters
more than level
when the economy is the question so the
direction of things tells you
more than where things are at
and the direction is positive can you
believe that
consumer sentiment the primary thing
that will make our recovery happen
is trending positive
in the middle of the coronavirus just
think about that
and
um
and well above the dow jones estimate so
where professionals thought it would be
was like way lower
and it says the index of current
economic conditions
soared to 83 from 74.
in other words
our economy is not only not dead
i think it went to the gym
um i think our economy is starting to
flex
it's like it's like it rested too long
you know you're starting to see you know
you're starting to see
i rested a little too long ah
you ever uh you're trying to let's say
get your numbers up for
running distance you know you're doing a
few miles every day and then you know
there's a day that you can't run
but the day after that you're really
strong because you had that little rest
i feel like the economy
is that olympic athlete who's who had to
take a few days off for business
but man
that day when you get back after a few
days off when you've been training for a
month
that's the day you get some serious
serious work in
so
uh
that
is coffee with scott adams
and tonight
i hope you'll join me again you know
when and you know where
i've stopped telling people when and
where to find me on periscope because
hey you've got google
and i like to keep it a little bit
special
and so i hope i did and we'll go look at
the stock market oh well let me look at
it before i
sign off here
let's see what everybody's talking about
holy cow
wow
well
that's uh that's the stock market holy
what the hell is going on
my god
oh i've
what
[Laughter]
this is crazy
all right go take a look at the stock
market
uh have a good day
we're back
