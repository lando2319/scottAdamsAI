good morning everybody
and
oh wow
is it my imagination or are you better
looking today than yesterday
yeah sexier sexier
well
on that positive note
how would you like the rest of the day
to go as well as that
you would and all you would need would
be
a copper mug or a glass of tanker tells
you to sign a canteen jug of alaska a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now
it's the best thing that'll ever happen
to you go
i feel my mitochondria are repairing
themselves a little bit faster
all systems go
so would you like to hear about all the
good news
isn't it weird that i keep telling you
that we're going to enter a golden age
but you listen to the news and it's all
like
the world is falling apart
everything's bad
alright here's some positive things that
are in the pipeline
there's a company that's made some big
breakthrough in
uh battling autoimmune problems
which could include things like lupus
and ms
some really big stuff
and apparently they've got
something that looks like it works
really well
now the details doesn't matter
because remember the rule
remember the rule when i tell you about
a a breaking breakthrough new technology
what's the rule
when i tell you about a breakthrough new
science or technology
the rule is
we're going to pretend it's true
because most of these end up not being
true
they end up being big disappointments in
the end but our agreement with each
other
is we'll pretend they're all true
because it feels good
if it turns out later it's not true well
you're not really worse off you felt
good for a while so we're gonna take to
feel good okay
so it looks like there might be a
breakthrough in lupus and ms and other
autoimmune stuff
um
thanks to machiavelli's underbelly for
tweeting some other good news
uh it looks like
a flying car will happen in my lifetime
there's one that's being funded it's
already built
and it's basically a it's like sitting
on top of a hobby drone
you know if you just took one of those
little drones that you can buy in the
store
and put a little uh
put a little cab on top of it like a car
that's what it is basically a four-rotor
four-rotor situation
now remember i told you the only thing
we were waiting for
you know because flying cars have been
the thing we've joked about forever
the things we've been waiting for are
here
ai
to make sure that the thing can stay
stable
and batteries that are powerful enough
to take people long enough that's it
we have everything else
so the flying car
might not be able to get licensed you
know there might be government
regulations and stuff
but we can build it now
it's done there
we have the technology
likewise there's a company that's
already built
a functioning flying motorcycle
so it's very similar to what i just
described except instead of having a
automobile cab on top of a drone
imagine a motorcycle situation so you've
got motorcycle handles and you're just
sitting on top of a drone it just is a
big one
and that already exists in the sense
that
they're already demoing it and driving
around in space not space but in the air
so we got flying cars flying motorcycles
autoimmune disease
and there's a company also working on
fuel cells for drones
which doesn't seem like a big big deal
except that these fuel cells would
extend the you know the range and the
power of the drones
substantially like a really big deal now
it doesn't mean they'll catch on maybe
nobody will ever buy a
fuel cell
drone
but the fact that we can do it is
certainly directionally interesting
i was thinking yesterday
what are the odds that i would be born
and many of you too
so that i can see the following things
that will only happen once
in the history of humankind
one of the odds for example the
the development of the computer
the computer was built
and developed in my lifetime
now how many humans will be born and die
over the you know the course of human
civilization and human i don't know
biology
what are the odds that i would be alive
when computers are developed
now and space travel exactly
to go to the moon so space travel
artificial intelligence now in my
opinion artificial intelligence is also
is already sentient but then we just get
into arguing about definitions
but i believe the ai will be sentient in
my lifetime
that's only going to happen once
ever
the first time anyway
what are the odds of that
what about the
virtual reality
the metaverse
that's only going to happen once
that's happening in my lifetime
flying cars
the first ones are only going to happen
once
looks like it's going to be my lifetime
what are the odds of that really
doesn't that seem weird
like like that that's one of the
arguments for this being a simulation
and for me being a player in a game
because i can't really understand the
odds of it
unless i'm a player in a game and it's
designed so i see more stuff
it is a weird coincidence
all right
have you ever thought about all the um
oh and also digital currency
digital money crypto
all in my lifetime
and that's just like a small sample of
things that are happening just in my
lifetime
but here are some things that
you have to stop and think about the
things that have changed permanently
because of the pandemic
so i'm going to give you a starter list
of things that permanently changed
during the pandemic
and then add to it so in the comments
you probably can think of a few more
so food delivery i don't think will ever
be the same
i suspect kitchens might just disappear
it will just be
delivered my food all the time it's just
cheaper and easier
healthcare will change forever
especially the online doctors on
zoom
working from home changed forever supply
chains are going to change forever
decoupling from
uh china especially
um
all of our energy systems will change
so we'll have a complete change of
energy
i might i might be alive during
nuclear fusion being developed
it looks like it looks like that's going
to happen
i i suppose i might just barely be alive
then but maybe
um
so all of our energy systems are being
retooled trust and institutions
completely different
the the way the world feels about any
official institution is completely
different now
that's going to have some expense
i don't know what happens with that but
that's not a nothing that's a big deal
we just don't know how that's going to
come out
and then i think also these
factory-built homes i don't know if it's
because of the pandemic
but
um
this this boom and these uh
factory-built homes they can sort of
deliver and just put together
now
let's combine a few concepts
let's combine the idea of relocating the
the homeless
which is the wrong name for them
you know we should stop calling them the
homeless
if they don't want a home
because they don't
most of them
we should call them the outdoor livers
or just the
just the outdoor people
because their preference is for outdoors
right that's the main thing they want
just let us be outdoors so we can have
more freedom
or in a way you could call them
the free
in a weird way they're the freest among
us are they not
who is more free than
street people
they can do all the drugs they want
seem to be able to violate the law at
will
go anywhere they can trespass
i know they should they don't have a
they don't have a job they have to be to
they don't have a boss
they don't pay taxes
exactly i call them campers
campers
now that would be funny that's the
funniest one
instead of calling them homeless
call them campers
[Laughter]
that's just getting funnier as i think
about it
campers
i'm sure somebody would say you're big
and sensitive
all right
so
there's a whole bunch of stuff that's
going to happen in my lifetime a lot of
it accelerated by the pandemic
but if here's what it feels like
it feels like the wheels are coming off
doesn't it
if you read the news
oh no inflation is going to kill us and
the immigrants will change the nature of
the country and climate change will you
know mop up whatever humans are
surviving and the racism will
put us in each other's throats and
everything else
is it really worse than it was in the
60s
are any of you old enough to remember
the 60s
it doesn't feel worse
does it
oh some of you say yes you think it's
worse than the 60s i think that might be
selective memory though
in the 60s we thought that uh russia was
going to nuke us
there's no way i would live to die of
old age because i get nuked
yeah that's better televised
well
it feels like we're in some big
rebooting phase
that's what it feels like to me
in order to get to the new thing you
have to go through a bad thing it's
almost always true
if you want to build a house you usually
have to do demolition first because
there's already one there
usually in all the good locations
right so if you want to get
if you want to get radar
you have to have world war ii
sorry
that's the only way you're gonna get
radar
um no it's probably not the only way but
there are a lot of things that got
accelerated and maybe this maybe the
pandemic is just a big reboot program it
feels like it
well mike lindell as you know was um
what would you call it he was stopped
and surrounded by fbi agents and they
took his phone
that they have now access to
so mike lindell
and i don't believe he's been charged
with anything is that right there's
there are no indictments against mike
lindell that i'm aware of
he's targeted but we don't know if
there's any charges i suppose they don't
know either until they look at his phone
but he's uh he's retained alan
dershowitz to sue the fbi and the
department of justice
to which i say
good for you
good for you you know what i you know
what i think the government or the
democrats
here's what i think the democrats have
totally
underestimated
here's what the democrats i believe
have totally underestimated
two words
mike lindell
i feel like they underestimated him
am i wrong
because i don't think he's out of money
he seems to be i don't know maybe he
took a big hit with my pillow
just by speaking out
but he doesn't look like he's willing to
quit
right
now the game that you play with somebody
like him is you hope you can scare him
off
before he gets too serious
and he was pretty serious to start
but it looks like they're not scaring
him off and he's just getting more
aggressive
so
is he the guy you wanted to piss off he
obviously has skill he's got a lot of
capability i mean he built a company
you know really was on his personality
if anything else
so in a sense
it looks like the government may have
found a you know a worthy nemesis
because i think he's going to take it to
him
we'll see i don't know
i don't think he got where he is by lock
do you
i mean it looks like skill it looks like
he's good at selling good at getting
stuff done
we'll find out but it's an interesting
development see if he can make something
out of this
the other day i said that
to persuade the government to do more in
fentanyl we should produce pictures of
300 dead bodies every day
and
machiavelli's underbelly asked an ai to
do that and sure enough so i tweeted
this morning
a group of bodies that looks like they
died on the capital steps
now i would improve that
by making them instead of spread out on
a field
i wouldn't spread them out on the field
i'd put them in an actual pile
so it's the pile that actually sells the
story it's not the number
like if you just had a row of people who
died that wouldn't be persuasive you
need the pile
because the pile tells you how you're
treating the dead
you've treated them like they didn't
matter
that's what the pile says
a a group of people dead in the field
says something bad happened
well we already knew that right
but if you put them in a pile
it says not only does something bad
happen but we don't care
we'll just throw them in a pile
and
and so
if we can tweak that
i'd put him in a pile and i would take
the american flags off them because that
ended up being accidentally patriotic i
think the ai
wrapped all the bodies in an american
flag
so let's get the positive imagery away
and put it in into just purely horror
we'll see what that does
um
so yesterday i did a number of reframes
for republicans telling them how to sell
their own policies better
and
i turned those into a series of little
videos so each reframe has its own
little
two or four minutes whatever it is
and that's on my channel if you want to
go see that i was asked to put that into
a playlist
which i'll work on today
so we'll put that into a playlist
but i tweeted it i tweeted somebody
else's playlist this morning so if you
want to see the whole list of them
just look at my twitter
um
so
governor newsom my governor here in
california has challenged florida's
governor ron desantis
to a debate
because i guess desantis said something
uh humorous and insulting about
newsome's hair gel
and newsome said uh
you know hey desantis clearly you're
struggling distracted and busy playing
politics with people's lives meaning the
martha's
vineyard stuff we'll talk about that he
goes i'll bring my hair gel you bring
your hair spray
name the time before election day
and
i don't know
speaking of underestimated
are you underestimating newsom
because he's not a guy you want to
underestimate you know that right
he really does
he's got the whole package
he does have the whole package
so if you're underestimating him that's
that would be a mistake
he he does have the goods he could bring
it
so
uh and again that's from a you know a
democrat respect
perspective um
but what do you think of this idea of
him challenging a governor from another
state they're not even running against
each other or will they
or will they
maybe not this election maybe the next
one what also could be this one
it could be
could be this one
it's hard to imagine newsome primering
uh biden but it's possible
it could happen it's a weird or or biden
could drop down or something
but i like the idea completely
anytime two politicians uh are willing
to debate in public and they're both
capable and with that's what's different
about this these are two media stars
who are super capable
i would love to see that debate
and especially if there's nobody else on
stage i don't like these eight people
debates do you i mean that's that's
barely anything but a few sound bites
but you could have an actual debate
between two highly capable people with
different opinions that would be very
useful
so i would say
newsom you get the win on this one
because he's asking for something that i
as a
a consumer would like to see as a
citizen i'd like to see it
so i don't think it's going to happen
do you
i don't think it's going to happen
newsom is going to debate his
republican
contender for
california which is appropriate
but no i don't think that's ever going
to happen
you know what the best news
of the year is
what is the best news of the year
i'm going to say is
desantis shipping the migrants
the illegal immigrants as you like to
say or undocumented pick your phrase
up to martha's vineyard
this is the only story i could think of
where everybody came out ahead
and also had something to complain about
which is also coming out ahead
correct me if i'm wrong but the the
migrants themselves don't seem unhappy
in fact they're probably being treated
pretty well
so the migrants are fine
i would think i don't see any problem
got a little attention it was a little
exciting imagine being a migrant you
just came from some horrible situation
the next thing you know you're on tv in
america and you're at martha's vineyard
and
you don't know where you're going to end
up but it looks like
it looks like the country has embraced
you
that's what i would think
if i were a migrant i would think the
country had embraced me
because one party sent me on a nice trip
to a good place and then when we got
there that that place made sure i had
food and a place to stay
i don't know what happens next i'm not
sure what happens after they get
taken from their
cages they're probably in
i don't know what happens after that but
so you've got the the republicans who
were delighted
because as a political stunt it was
really good
as political stunts go
it exactly
made the case that the republicans want
to make
they got all the attention they wanted
it did deepen the conversation which is
what they wanted
i'd say the republicans won
now how about the democrats
they won two
so they won
because they said yes we will take care
of them and then they did what their
version of taking care of them is we
just sent them off to some military base
but that took care of them
in my opinion that's not cheating
i know that the right leading news is
sort of acting like that's cheating oh
no you didn't keep them in martha's
vineyard you ship them off to a
military base to which i say it doesn't
matter how you do it
i i think the migrants won i think the
democrats made their point
they actually treated it like a
sanctuary
they they took care of them
and they didn't didn't send them to jail
i guess
so for some weird reason the the
migrants won the democrats won and the
republicans won
everybody won nobody died and nobody got
injured
everybody ate nobody got a sunburn
taxpayers lost well did they i don't
know i'm not even sure taxpayers lost
because it cost money
but it was money
that deepened
you know deepened the
debate in a way that i think is
productive actually so this is one of
the most weirdly win-win-win
productive things the country has ever
done
and the fact that we're you know both
the republicans and democrats are
accusing each other of being the
hypocrite
it doesn't get any better than that
that is that is peak awesomeness
everything about the martha's vineyard
story
is good
everything even the way we're
complaining about it is good
because if that's all we have to
complain about
we're in pretty good shape
yeah i guess it's no fun to talk about
inflation non-stop we do have real
problems
but this wasn't one of them
and um i do love the republican theory
that if there's a part of the country
that says hey it's a sanctuary and
you're welcome
and there's another part of the country
that the citizens are like
maybe not so much here
why isn't this a win for everybody
if it's a sanctuary
take him to the sanctuary
and the way the way desantis has
explained it i think was perfect
we're not a sanctuary city
martha's vineyard is a sanctuary city
where does an immigrant want to go
an illegal immigrant
where do they want to go
do they want to go to the place that
doesn't want them
or the place
that says hey sanctuary come on in
it's weirdly win-win-win
even though it's a just a political
trick
it's the weirdest situation
but this is the sort of thing that
proves we're in pretty good shape
the fact that this is what we're talking
about
and and somehow because we're all dumb
we've managed to make this real problem
which is you know the debacle at the
border
if you think about the border and you
know the struggling people trying to
stay alive and coming in and how we're
trading that's like a big big hard
problem
but once the news put it in martha's
vineyard it became a sitcom
oh look it's people it's a fish and a
water story
it's a
it's fresh prince of beverly hills
look we took somebody who is not
normally in a high-end environment and
we put it in a high-end environment
ah look at that look at the
entertainment we got out of that
am i right we took an actual
human tragedy
an ongoing rolling tragedy and we turned
it into this little
humorous sitcom
and now nobody's thinking well not
nobody that's an exaggeration it
diverted our energy
from a real problem
to this like sit commie thing fish
underwater fresh prince of beverly hills
situation
i don't know i think it trivialized the
whole thing but it did it did what the
republicans wanted it to do
it told the story that they wanted to
tell
and it looks like desantis is going to
be sending some more
so we'll see more of this
there was some fake news around this
there was some
immigrant activist person in other words
somebody who was pro-immigration
who tweeted something i'm paraphrasing
but something along the lines of the way
desantis was treating these migrants
according to this person
was uh
it was as if he had been driving around
and throwing his trash out the windows
from his car
and then what does the people on the
right said are you calling
are you calling the migrants trash
you hypocrite you're supposed to be on
their side
then nbc retweeted it you know that's
all fake news right
did you all did anybody get fooled by
that
it's just all fake news
the original tweet
was accusing desantis of treating the
migrants like trash
there's no other way to read that
but somehow if you got fooled into
thinking the person who tweeted it
was saying that
either the martha's vineyard people or
the person tweeting it thinks that
migrants are trash
you really got taken by fake news
and it's it's all over the right
the the right is just leaning on this
heart that's completely fake
completely fake somebody said something
bad about desantis
and the people on the right
decided to tell you that it was the
opposite of what it was there was
something bad about migrants
that never happened
and never happened
it was just a comment about desantis
but it was you know in a political
environment the republicans tried to
turn it into a weapon
but it was fake
it still worked as a weapon
i was not aware of this until yesterday
that
our government is copying china
not really copying but
we're
apparently the u.s government is going
to have its own digital currency
at which point they can track everything
now they're they're close to being able
to track everything but only for people
who have money
if you're poor
and you pay in cash they can't track you
so well but if you have a credit card of
any kind
oh they can track the hell out of you
already
but once you have a digital currency one
assumes that everything will turn
digital eventually then you can't cheat
the government you can't have an
underground business you can't do any
sketchy deals
i don't know if you're going to want to
live in that world but
you know i'll just say it out loud
people are uncomfortable living in a
world where they can't cheat
am i supposed to say that out loud
because people don't say it that way but
that's all that's what it is
people are very uncomfortable living in
a world where they can't break the law
and cheat
because people want to be able to break
the law and cheat
it's a very popular thing you know
cheating on your taxes taking cash
people really really want to do that
stuff
so we'll see if the government gets away
with it i think they will
one of the weirdest predictions i made
maybe 15 or 20 years ago in my book the
dilru future
i predicted that
all crimes would be solved in the future
and it sounded ridiculous
but i saw this coming
once you can
you've got everybody on video
and you can manage everybody's
transactions
how the hell do you do a crime anymore
if we've got a picture of you and we've
got your all of your records of where
you were and what you spent and what you
bought
you can't get away with anything
this will first of all get rid of street
mugging
because there won't be any cash so
there's a whole bunch of robbery that
will just go away
because there won't be cash
there's a lot of crime that will go away
but it's crime that we're used to
we all think that we have a right to
that kind of crime
right well you know
everybody cheats on their taxes a little
bit so
why can't i
uh i avoid that theory because i'm a
public figure
so
i'm really careful on
you know my financial world to keep that
keep that
completely legal
you don't want to make that mistake
yeah they can steal credit cards so i
suppose they could steal your passwords
for your crypto
so yeah that's what that risk is there
but i'm not sure that the common street
criminal will be still in business when
you have to be a hacker to steal
something
if all you needed was a gun there it's a
lot more accessible business
well here's the update on ukraine
um so yesterday was it yesterday some of
the comments here were saying that when
russia
took out that dam that it might have
been a
clever
you know super evil move to strand part
of the ukrainian army so it could be
destroyed by the russian army
that might be an overstatement as in
maybe russia would like you to believe
that that was to their favor
but it doesn't seem to be true on the
ground
exactly i mean it might have made a
difference but not a big difference
and
so
um
there doesn't seem to be any narrative
saying that russia has the ability to
counter attack the counter-attack
meaning ukraine is on the offensive
and one opinion i saw this morning is
that russia's military
is designed as a
occupation force
and not so much a fighting force
and if that's true and i have a hard
time believing that's true but if it's
true
then the ukrainians are an offensive
force against aiden
basically a non-fighting force
which is what it looks like
it looks like you know one one came to
fight and the other came to
squat
and the squatters are being killed by
the people who came to fight
now keep in mind that a hundred percent
of anything that i say about ukraine
could be completely wrong
it could be that i'm reading the wrong
propaganda feeds i have no idea but i'll
tell you what you don't see anywhere you
don't see it coming from russia
you don't see anybody else saying it
which is that the russians
are
making any gains
now putin did say they're taking new
territory but nobody believes that right
nobody believes they're taking new
territory
i don't think
um so at this point
the
the i would say the forming consensus
from the experts who are close enough to
have an opinion
um
are making it look like the ukrainians
will be able to liberate that
that area now russia of course has
options for stepping up the
the risk and the danger maybe destroying
the rest of the
infrastructure in ukraine with
long-range weapons that would be pretty
bad
but
they don't seem to have the ability to
fight on the ground against the
ukrainian
advances so what's up with that
and and i tell you again that
how can you hold territory
when all of your local leaders would be
the collaborators with russia they'll
all be murdered because there's there's
no way you could protect the
collaborators could you
how are any collaborators ever protected
because they still go outdoors i mean
they still have families i just don't
know how you can do it
now i i understand how you could do it
before
the war had reached this level of
conflict
like you know russia had their little
area that they controlled
and they probably just said
if anything happens to one of our side
really bad things are going to happen to
you
but if the context is that really bad
things are happening to everybody every
day because that's what a war is
then suddenly the
the locals are going to say you know i'm
in the middle of a war zone
and there's that collaborator over there
walking
through the public square
i'm just going to take that guy out
so it's hit to be at an all-in high
right now
worth doing
because maybe you killed a few
collaborate
the situation
but now you're at a point where killing
collaborators definitely could change
the situation
definitely good because if any if
nothing else it would convince russia
that there's no way to hold the
territory
you just keep killing the collaborators
as fast as possible
yeah see the difference was that the
nazis had they had another way to
control populations
which was collective punishment
so the nazis could say oh you killed one
of ours
uh give me 500 of your men and we'll
line them up and shoot them in front of
you
and that would work i think
but
that's not the situation in ukraine
because i don't think putin can do that
like if he goes full
full hitler in that very specific way
i don't feel like he could survive it
and we'd know about it
so he just doesn't have the tools that a
you know a true despot would have
working against basically his own people
you know the ukrainians and the russians
have too much in common
uh putin has already done that with
civilians i doubt it i doubt it
now i don't doubt that there have been
war atrocities
but i don't think putin has ordered
people to line up civilians and shoot
them i don't think that happened
it may have happened but i don't think
he ordered it
that would be a dumb thing to order
so the texas supreme court
ordered that
social media platforms can't censor
people's
voice
and i don't quite know what this means
yet
you know texas is big enough that the
social media platforms will have to
either satisfy them or not operate in
their state
do you think they're going to give up on
texas
because it seems like other states will
follow suit
since this well i mean i don't know
maybe this goes to the
the real supreme court
maybe gets overturned but if this holds
then i would think other states would
take a look at it and then social media
platforms are going to have to get
pretty serious
about changing something
anyway
um
and i saw alex berenson uh celebrating
this victory
what what is your opinion of
um i don't want to bring this up as a
topic
but i'm only interested in the data
collection part of it
do you think it's possible at this point
that all the different
medical experts around the world
would say nothing about vaccinations if
they were actually more dangerous
in general we're not talking about the
special case of
vaccinating children i don't know who's
in favor of that
but in the case of vaccinating anybody
you know just anybody who makes sense to
get vaccinated
do you think that the
all the experts in the world
are seeing data that says it's more
dangerous
than not doing it and yet they're all
doing it
or do you think that they're all seeing
evidence that is working
not as vaccine but as a
therapeutic
and a pre-therapeutic whatever that
means
so
so there
here's what you would have to believe
you would have to believe that there's
no whistleblower in any country
in an official capacity who's willing to
say wait wait a minute
you're looking at this data
this data says it's sketchy
why are you all saying it's not
where is that person
because there are plenty of people
outside the system
you know the the malones etc there are
lots of people outside the system
who are saying stuff like that but why
nobody inside the system
now your first impression is well they
can't
take the risk
they can't take the risk
but it's a really big world
there are always enough people to take
the risk there's no shortage of people
to take the risk if you're talking about
the whole world
if you're talking about a specific
company or a department within a company
yeah
yeah maybe nobody takes the risk
but you talk about all of the medical
experts all the scientists in the world
who have access to largely the same
information at this point
you're telling me that
with all those experts
if there were solid data saying that the
vaccinations are injuring people more
than they're helping them you're saying
that we wouldn't know that by now
now we're not talking about the future
that's still unknown but
but people a lot of people think that
the evidence is still completely here
somebody says fear and money but here's
my
warning to you always
there's no such thing as a hundred
percent of humans doing the same thing
for anything
and
it's amazing how many times we make that
mistake
to imagine that
people would all act the same
so so here's the math of it
if you have one person
and it's the story is only about one
person
can you trust that the one person will
act like himself
well probably
it's one person acting like themselves
if you have two people in a story
could you imagine that they would act
like
in tandem together
sure it's pretty easy for two people to
collude
three people gets a little harder 10
people harder
but when you get to millions
millions of people who could potentially
you know be a whistleblower or debunk or
not even be a whistleblower
just send down a tweet
just send down a tweet hey i'm a doctor
i'm reading this study
and this study is telling me
something bad
you tell me there's not one doctor who's
still in the system
who won't put out that tweet
that would that would be different than
everything we know about everything
that would change everything about
reality if that were true
there's no reality where millions of
people are on the same side
none
that is not possible
that was the the great barrington
declaration
are those people who are working
currently within
jobs that they haven't been fired
mass delusion
mass delusion wouldn't do it
i don't think it would do it
see mass delusion also doesn't get
everybody
it's the everybody problem it's it's not
the majority problem it's the everybody
problem
uh
so dr drew was
talking about it
so the trouble is
that the people who who are saying
negatives about it
tend to be the people who talk about
things in public
but we're now seeing like
you know a member of the top
medical team of some european country
say you know
we're all looking at the same
information but i'm looking at this
differently
this doesn't look good to me
anyway
keep that in mind what are the odds
i guess uh in pennsylvania the two uh
candidates for senate
federen and oz have decided to debate
i'm gonna watch that one
because one of the debaters
had a stroke fetterman
and we don't even know if he can debate
because his public appearances have
suggested that
for health reasons
it's difficult for him to form sentences
how do you debate if you can't form
sentences reliably
will you get a sympathy vote well
apparently democrats have already said
they don't care
so they democrats have said well if his
policies are good we don't need him to
be able to talk and think and walk and
stuff like that
and and i think biden made that easy
so if he thinks fetterman can't win
because he's obviously degraded you have
to keep in mind that the republican the
democrats have looked at two years of
joe biden
who's clearly degraded
and they're saying to themselves yeah
that worked that worked give us some
more of that
because it works so well with biden why
wouldn't it work with this other person
who can't walk and talk
why not
so
i think the
the room got softened up by biden
all right well it's a slow news day
and
i don't know what else we have to talk
about do you
is there something i missed
was there a uh
is that really a neck tumor he has or is
that just neck fat fetterman i can't
tell there's some pictures of him
looking like he's got a
big old lump on the back of his neck but
it might be just a neck fat
um
did republican strategists reach out to
me no no
nor nor would i expect them to
so the trouble is if you're
a strategist you think you don't need
other people's advice because you're
selling advice
the the people who are selling advice
are not going to ask for
my advice
because people can get that for free
imagine being a high priced
uh consultant
right you're let's say you're charging i
don't know 100 000 per month
which is probably in the ballpark right
high-end strategist 100 000 per month
are you gonna charge a hundred thousand
per month and then bring to the person
who's paying the bill
an idea that you saw for free on twitter
or youtube
i mean i'm not sure how you do that
oh you know i'm charging you a hundred
thousand per month but you know if you
just watch this youtube channel for free
you'd have everything you need so let me
just show you the youtube channel and
you give me my hundred thousand dollars
for this month i don't know
it's pretty hard
pretty hard
um
what about james clear
i like where you're going with that
comment but i don't know where it's
going
um
scott cover the degree and topic
argument on january 6
that i did on locals
uh
i'm pretty tired this morning what what
did i say about that
well i
if i just rethink it from scratch i'll
probably come come to the same place
the republicans need to say that the
assault on the capitol was terrible
the violent parts
and that we should move on
and that we should agree that
both sides should work hard for
election transparency and integrity
it's a winning message
because it's not like they're going to
go back in time anyway it wouldn't
matter how
how bad it was
now
the rayapps thing
i've also said
we should make a national agreement the
democrats and republicans independents
do
is to base our entire opinion on rayapps
now
he doesn't explain everything no matter
what you know about him it doesn't
really explain everything
but we can agree that he does
ima imagine if we looked into it and we
were convinced all of us
that he really wasn't an fbi agent
that's possible
right very possible
would you be willing to drop it then say
all right all right
we don't know what happened
but let's agree to move on if the
rayapps thing is nothing let's agree to
move on even if there's something there
we'll try to we'll try to fix it for the
next time
but what if you find out that rapture
actually was working for the fbi or
associated with them in some productive
way then
then you get to say all right we were
right
release all these people from their
prisons
and
and then still focus on the future
so
the
the bad argument is
there was nothing that went wrong on
on january 6. that's just a bad argument
and it's maybe even worse to say oh it
was just a few few violent people
i'd rather just say yeah it was a
horrible thing
let's let's uh let's move on let's find
out what we can about ray epps and then
just move on
how can he prove he wasn't fbi
hmm
i don't know
i guess that calls into question what
proof means
but i suppose if uh if he were
interrogated enough you could find out
one way or another
um
there's a streak of insanity
you know it's funny that we all watch
politics as if the politicians mean it
to be serious
and then we debate it like they meant it
to be serious
i'm way past that
it's hard to debate things that people
didn't mean to be serious
as if it were serious
i can't get past the fact that they
didn't mean it when they said it
if you didn't mean it when you said it
and it's obvious
didn't mean it when you said i don't
need to debate whether it's true or
false
if you didn't mean it when you said it
and it's obvious
uh epps could prove it by going to trial
now you couldn't really prove it prove
it
because you can't prove a negative
you could simply show there's no
evidence of it maybe i don't know
um
a simulated
yeah so we do have uh videos now
of the simulated 300 dead per day
but
put them in a pile
um and today we did another uh dilbert
esg
cartoon
and i don't yet know how many newspapers
have canceled me or or censored this
week
but uh things are gonna get a lot dicier
in the coming days
so i just wrote a series that i don't
know
if the newspapers will publish
uh i'll give you a uh a preview
dilbert's life is going to mirror my own
personal experience
so there's going to be an opening for a
promotion
and dilbert will be one of the people
considered
and the boss will will tell him he's
being considered
but he's being considered along with
alice
niles a tina the tech writer who has no
qualifications for the the job opening
uh dave the new employee
who looks black but because he's a
prankster he identifies as white just to
thwart the boss
and
uh
i shook the intern
now you may have noticed that each of
those three characters have something
extra going on
right so they're either
people of color or female
and
the way it's being set up is that
dilbert will be known to all evolved
including the other people who are up
for the job even they will know that
gilbert is the most qualified for this
opening
but he will not get the job
so
do you think i'm going to get away with
that
do you
do you want do you want to do you want
to hear the writing before i draw it
i might read it to you
let's say i don't think i can find it
quickly enough but if i can
on my little device here i will read you
the ones that i think are going to get
killed let's see um
nope
i'll find it in a minute
dilbert dailies
god
yes there it is it's so hard to find
things
you ever notice that
um
and then they're not
scanned in order
modified
short by modified oh god they're all
they're all sorted in some random order
that doesn't look like they can be
resorted
why is this so hard
anyway
i guess i can't
the the interface for dropbox is so bad
that i can't even just like go in and
see uh
see my own files
they're organized chronologically it
doesn't look like you can sort them
there's no way that they didn't leave me
that option
can i really not sort them
it'd be crazy
it doesn't look like i can
huh
amazing
all right sorry i mumbled and looked
away from you for a while
but i'll look at it on another computer
and read it to the locals people after
we're done here with youtube
and yes it'll be a locals exclusive
um
oh god
how dare you
that's the punchline of an upcoming
comic how dare you
all right
that's all for now youtube i'll talk to
you tomorrow
locals stay on here with me
