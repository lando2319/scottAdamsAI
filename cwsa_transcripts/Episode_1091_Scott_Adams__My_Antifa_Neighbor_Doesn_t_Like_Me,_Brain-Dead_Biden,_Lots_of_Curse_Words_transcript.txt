hey everybody
come on in this morning we're going to
have
extra cursing so if you've got children
make sure they are well out of the way
there will be extra cursing
well uh has anybody watched the news
recently
there isn't any there isn't any news
every morning i wake up and i think i'm
going to look at the news
i look at cnn i'll look at
fox and they'll say all right i'll i'll
talk about the news
but today there wasn't any it's just
purely political
neither fox nor cnn are even even
pretending
to cover anything like news today it's
just all just
pure politics it's fun
but there was no news which makes you
wonder
what's up with the news wait
we need something we need the
simultaneous sift because today will not
be complete
without it
and all you need is a copper mug or
glass of tank or gels or sign a canteen
jagger flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing that makes
everything better including joe
biden's rotting brain
drink ah this is a good one
um yes so there will be extra cursing
today
oh it's called for it's very called for
um have you noticed
we'll get to all the good stuff here but
have you noticed that
um if you if you encounter
somebody on twitter who just gives you a
sarcastic
comment without any reasons
just stuff like oh scott i see you're
you're really looking into it today or
well i i guess that's all we need to
know
and i think to myself who would put a
sarcastic comment
that doesn't even kind of work in the
situation
and i checked the profile what kind of
profession
writers artists writers musicians
less musicians it's usually visual
artists
and writers what is wrong with those
people
they they literally can't tell the
difference between sarcasm and reasons
and
once you see it you can't unsee it
the pattern is so clear when somebody
who's
say a lawyer or engineer an economist
disagrees with me
it takes about two seconds to find out
where the disagreement is
usually some disagreement about a fact
that's hard to research or you know a
difference of priorities for example
but it never seems crazy it just feels
like people have a little different view
of the world
perfectly fair just different from mine
but the artists the artists are not even
i don't even know if they know that that
logic and rationality even exist
it's like it's not even a thing in their
world they don't they they go through
these conversations at least as if it's
nothing that needs to be addressed
rationality why i have sarcasm
i have all i need look at my sarcasm
that should cover it i mean
so anyway
so when hillary clinton was running
against
trump i have to admit that for me it
felt
personal because i really didn't like
hillary clinton
and she was anti-male now if anybody i
ever had a good reason to be anti-male
it's hillary clinton she you know she
comes by
honestly you know i i think hillary
clinton could be
completely forgiven for being anti-male
right if we're being fair she's got a
reason
all right it's called bill but
whatever her reason are what whatever
her reason is she is
anti-male and i think that's pretty
obvious
and so anybody who's anti-b for
immutable
purposes doesn't matter why if they're
anti-men
anti-white people anti-black people if
if they're anti-anything
about something you're not going to
change or including i guess religion
even though you could technically change
that if you wanted to
um you know i i hate everybody who's in
that category basically
you know if somebody hates me for one to
any one of those reasons
i just hate their guts and
likewise if
you know if they're hating some other
group i'm not in for the same reason
i'm not too happy with them either so
but it's a little more personal when
it's me
of course so 2016 honestly felt personal
but i wasn't feeling that about biden or
kamala harris
because i don't really have a strong
feeling about them
until today and here's
here's the thing when biden was
originally
and when i say originally i mean not
that long ago
in the last few months he brings up the
the charlottesville fine people hoax
every now and then
and he believes or he acts like he
believes
that the president called the neo-nazis
fine people
all of you know it was a hoax you know
that the president literally said the
opposite
you know that all the people who said i
saw with my own ears
because they talk like that they see
things with their ears
you know that they saw the edited
version that reverses the meaning
if you see the full thing it completely
flips it
but
i thought when he was saying it
originally i said to myself you know
he's not all there he probably doesn't
know it's not real
he probably thinks it's real because a
lot of people were fooled into thinking
he was real so
maybe maybe he was fooled too but at
this point
at this point he's basing his campaign
on the charlottesville fine people hoax
he made that very clear again
last night with camellaris and
here's what's different do i understand
that president trump has failed the fact
checking
20 000 times can we just get this off
the table
yes i know it you don't have to
come into my comments
and say oh what are you saying if if
biden said that and it's not true
what about trump's 20 000 fact-checking
yes i
know it i know it
you don't have to tell me and you know
what's different
about the trump supporters from the
other people
they know what they're getting and they
chose it
right so we know that president trump
uses hyperbole
you know he influences he sells
and you don't take him exactly literally
if you understand where he's going
do i care if he built a hundred miles a
wall
or it's 65 don't care
in the big picture you might like 100
you know 100 better than 65 but it
doesn't really matter you know what he's
doing he's trying to show progress he's
trying to
you know keep keep people feeling good
about the country moving forward
pushing all the time that is very very
different
from saying that the president is a flat
out
racist because of the fine people hoax
now if the president had said that well
yeah
anybody who supported him would have a
lot of explaining to do
would you not agree if the president
really called the neo-nazis fine people
if that had
actually happened in the real world do
you think i would support it
no i i hope most of you wouldn't either
it wouldn't happen
so here's the thing the find people hoax
is not like other fact checking
it is the tent pole that allows the
people who are the anti-trumpers
to dehumanize his supporters to the
point of
 violence it is not safe
to live in a country where your
candidate for president
is demonizing what 35 percent of the
country 40 percent of the country
as literal racists because of this fine
people hoax
because again if that were true if this
president had actually said those
words i wouldn't support him but
he didn't
he didn't say those words he said the
exact
 opposite now what's different is
if you if you push that hoax you are
demonizing
trump supporters to the point of
violence
real violence yesterday i take
my garbage out in front of my house just
taking the garbage out
ordinary night car slows down in front
of my house pulls down
and puts the window down and calls me a
racist
by name so somebody knew my name
and called me a racist from their car
now of course idiot doesn't know
that in my neighborhood
we're kind of ready for this stuff so
here's a good picture of the
 idiot driving past all the
security cameras in the world
it's not the best place to commit a
crime
now i don't know if it's technically a
crime to call somebody erases from their
car
but we'll have a conversation later
today
now the interesting part about it is
when i heard the voice before i
you know looked at the video i couldn't
tell if it was male or female
it was somewhere in between and then i
look at it it's like oh
 it's antifa it's antifa
now i don't know if it's like
technically a member but you know they
all have that little uniform
and and you know how
the the genders are always a little hard
to determine
it's looks very antifa i don't know if
it is or not
so i don't know what gender we're
dealing with
and if you're if you're new to these if
you're new to this i don't care
i'm not one of those people who cares
about the labeling of the gender
i want everybody to be happy and do
whatever they want in their personal
sexual preferences i have just no i have
no biases about that at all
but uh it is sort of
an identifying feature of antifa i don't
think we can doubt that so here's the
thing
if my neighbor has the temerity to roll
past my house
not trying to hide his or her identity
or
whatever gender fluid situation is going
on here
um that's not a safe place to live
it's not because when you call somebody
a racist you are giving yourself
permission to hurt them
physically and so i ask this
why is it that twitter allows us so i
just tweeted before i got on
tweeted at jack dorsey that
if as i understand the twitter rules
um and let's say philosophical
preferences if you will
in addition to the rules my
understanding is that twitter
doesn't want to ban free speech so just
tell you saying something that isn't
true would not be enough to get you
banned or labeled or have your tweet
taken down or anything like that
so simply being not true
it can't be that big of a problem in the
world which you have free speech
because there's just going to be too
much of it right you can't really police
that
but there is a different category that
twitter cares about a lot
which is it could get somebody hurt
physically
a call to violence for example or
it could change the course of an
election because let's say
let's say it was a tweet telling you the
wrong day for election day
that that could change the actual
election so i would want
i would want social media to flag that
because you do want everybody to show up
in the right day right
i mean you know i don't want to win any
elections so much that i want people to
show up on the wrong day
uh to win it that's that's not the way
to get there
um so here's the thing
i think twitter has to recognize that
the fine people hoax
is not like other facts because it is a
call to violence
it is a pretty direct call to violence
because once you've
said that the supporters are on the side
of the neo-nazis
in the united states that's permission
that's permission for violence it's
permission from what my neighbor
did who will be hearing about it a
little bit later
all right it's permission and
twitter i think you got to look at this
pretty carefully
this is not like other fact checking
when you say somebody's with the
neo-nazis
in the united states in 2020 you just
painted a target on their back
all right so let me let me back up to my
point about
when hillary was running it felt
personal to me
with biden and kamala harris it did not
until
yesterday now it's personal
i've got a stake in this i'm actually
physically
at risk if this lie
keeps going i've spent months trying to
kill this thing
and the fake news who is now completely
illegitimate to the point of accepting
violence against part of the citizenship
of this country
has a lot to explain now
i'll give jake tapper credit he's the
only person i know a cnn
who has clarified at least the fine
people hoax on camera
and said that the president went on to
say he wasn't talking about that group
so jake's the only person who's even
given
a little care to whether it's
true or false
and i feel like he could step up a
little bit better too
you know ultimately i ended up blocking
jake
and so he's out of my life now you know
i'd
we'd work together on some charities and
stuff
and uh i liked him but here's my rule
if somebody thinks i'm a racist i'm not
going to be your friend
i'm not going to give do a favor for you
i'm not going to
have you in my life at one you little
 bit
all right now you can have all the
opinions you want
but if you think i'm a racist because
you know i think the president is not
if that's what you think you just
get out of my life and stay out
right i don't want to have anything to
do with you all right if you're that
 dumb that you think you believe
the fine people hoax
and that's and that's coloring your
world view yeah
in in jake's case i don't know what the
 is going on there because he
uh i think he knows well i i don't think
he wants
i won't i won't i won't assume i know
what he's thinking
so forget that all right so here's the
thing the gloves are off
and here's here's a specific thing that
i'll be doing
a little bit differently i had been
saying that i felt bad
about making fun of biden's mental state
because he's not all there and i think
that
you know i've been saying that he needs
a more respectable send-off
you know he he should be retired
with some dignity for his years of
public service
people say he's a nice person and you
know he's nice in person
i don't doubt it but now it's war
because biden is making it dangerous
so let me let me put it very clearly
um
there's almost nothing that's off the
table anymore
because it's a clear and present danger
to me physically
all right once it becomes a physical
danger
all the rules are off right
um i believe there are two ways to fight
in terms of like getting into a fight
with another person
method one is run away which is always
my first choice
if somebody wants to fight me and i
think i might get hurt
you know even if i win the fight i might
get hurt i don't want to get hurt
so my first instinct is run away and i
i would recommend this to all of you as
a self-defense mechanism
run away so that's strategy number one
run away
strategy number two is to kill the
person
and anything in between is just
all right anybody who gets in a fight
even if they think they're going to win
the fight i don't quite understand it i
mean there might be some special cases
where you have to because there's
something immediate happening
but if you have an option run away
but if that person still needs to be
killed well you know where to find them
why why would you take a chance of
getting hurt yourself
find them hunt them down and kill them
now fortunately
that has never happened i've never had
to hunt somebody down and kill them
because i've never had such a reason i
hope i never do
but my point is i don't have i don't
have an in-between
speed so in the political sense
biden has to go down not in the physical
sense
but in the political sense all
all the regulators are off so his
rotted brain can't ruin the
country
the way this looks like it's shaping up
so biden is going to have a little extra
pressure on him more to come on that
topic yeah it's a
strategic retreat is what it is yeah
here's what i've never understood
why would you hurt somebody who knows
where you live
have you ever thought that that was
weird it makes
you know i can imagine hurting somebody
if they didn't know who you were
and they didn't know where he lives but
if they know who you are
and where you live why would you ever
hurt somebody
it feels like a really bad strategy for
life because it's going to come back
all right
and it's kind of amazing to me that
something like the
fine people hoax and a lot of the other
hoaxes
they they can they can remain completely
intact
because the fake news has such a good
bubble
you know that the people on the left
they really won't
touch news that's not in their bubble i
mean it's like it's
you know you could send them a an
article from breitbart
try this with any of your friends send
an article from breitbart
to one of your trump hating friends and
say hey here's something that
contradicts what you thought was true
and it shows its sources
you can check for yourself and you'd see
that it's right you can't even get them
to read
a breitbart article they just won't do
it won't even read it
so their bubble is complete now i have
to admit
there are a few sources that i feel the
same
if somebody sends me an article from the
huffington post
to make their point well i'm not going
to read that
come on or the atlantic
has anybody ever sent you an article
from the atlantic
to make their case that you know trump
is orange man bad
if i see an article from the atlantic i
just laugh and i think you poor poor
bastard
if you believe if you're reading stuff
in the atlantic and you think
that that view of the world is anything
close to
uh accurate you poor poor
bastard
you know i asked this question and this
is serious
objectively speaking if you take
politics out of it
and you're just scoring is biden the
most prolific
liar the democrats have ever run for
president
do you think that that's true do you
think that there's never been a
bigger more obvious liar
than biden now of course you're going to
say hey but you know
bill clinton lied and you can say hey
obama lied
and you know all the all the politicians
lie you know
let us let us stipulate that we don't
have
presidents who have told no lies
according to third parties who
who rank these things but i'm just
saying that biden might be the lyingest
of all the liars
am i wrong about that because the types
of lies that he's told
are are ridiculous ones like his own
resume
he's lied about his education
he's i mean he's lied about some pretty
big stuff
and now the he's like he lied about the
president being soft on terrorists
what it's being soft on terrace
and so he says or vox yeah if somebody
says to me a vox article
i usually just laugh because you don't
really need to read it
to know that it's
um but if somebody sent me you know
something a little bit more mainstream i
might read it
um so that's just a question
in my opinion i think that we would find
at least in modern times
that biden is the most lyingest democrat
who's ever run on purely objective
things you would
you know i think you could just score it
see how many times he's lied and
what kind of lies they are which is an
interesting
strategy because what is the biggest
complaint about this president
you know when before trump was in office
there were all these complaints about
the bad things he would do
right he will blow up the country he
will destroy the economy
he will whatever and then
three years of governing and none of
that stuff happens
right he wasn't a russian puppet
you know the the russia collusion didn't
happen
so after three years you talk to your
democrat friends who
hate trump and you say what is it about
him
that you hate now that you've seen that
everything you thought would happen
didn't happen
and what is the usual answer
the usual answer you'll get from
an educated trump hater who's watched
him for three years and none of the
things that he thought would happen
happened
and what did they say well he's a liar
he's a big liar
now fact check me on this have you had
this conversation
after say three years of governing when
you don't have to guess what
happened you just look at it don't they
say the biggest problem with the
president
is that he lies that's it right it's the
number one thing
because all of the other things just
sort of went away now you and i
probably think okay you call it lying i
call it hyperbole
yeah he you know maybe should say less
about the medical stuff
well i get it but have we not learned
how to how to filter things
have we not watched enough of this
president to say
okay there's the claim now let's you
know look what the experts say you know
see if it's a hyperbole or not
have we not learned to understand how
that works
that he is intentionally and tells us
directly
this is the fun part the president told
us
while he was running before he was
elected after he was elected
that he uses optimism and uses hyperbole
and he tells us he actually tells us
that he's going to do it and then he
doesn't
that feels a lot different than just
making up a lie that would tear the
social fabric of the country apart
those are not the same thing biden's
lying is the
dangerous kind the president's lying if
you want to call it that
is the salesman kind is the salesman
destroying the country
no no probably not probably just selling
you a car that you might be happy with
if you bought
so somebody says i lived in delaware for
20 years and he's dirty
biden is well i don't doubt that
but he's been so vetted that i don't
know how many that's going to stick to
them
i know what you're talking about though
the credit card companies and all that
stuff
here's something funny have you seen the
way that the
media is treating the photography and
the graphic images for
uh harris and biden have you noticed
that they're putting
they're putting a big big picture of
kamal harris
and then they'll put a little picture of
biden standing behind her
on what planet in what year have you
ever seen the vice president
featured and the the top of the ticket
standing way back in the corner like
he's disappearing
have you seen that it is so obvious
that they're de-emphasizing biden the
head of the ticket
that if this were a comedy i mean you
could play this as a comedy
imagine this is a movie all right
literally imagine it's a movie and
you're seeing the graphic artists
and they're you know the graphic artist
comes to the boss they'll say they work
at one of these big publications
they say all right here's my graphic
treatment uh and the
the editor says ah can you make
you've you've got the vice president and
the president biden and harris
the candidates you you've got them the
same size
could you go back and make just make the
biden one a little bit smaller
and make that the harris one a little
bit bigger and graphic artist goes back
comes back and now the biden is half the
size
of the harris and the editor says
okay we're moving in the right direction
but the biden
is still a little bit big could you
you know just uh just a little bit just
take a little off and give me another
look
graphic artist comes back and now the
biden is 30
the size of the the big harris image and
the editor is like
could you just give me one more
look i just want to have something to
compare
you know one one with just a little bit
smaller can you make it
could you make the biden 10 percent the
size
and could you hide most of the biden
most of the body part behind the much
larger kamala harris picture
and then the graphic artist looks at
looks at the editor
and says sure sure sure i'll do that
and then as they're walking down the
hallway you see the graphic artist
muttering idiot
now if that were a movie because you
know
something somewhat like that actually
happened
you know that those pictures you saw
with tiny biden
and gigantic kamala harris it wasn't the
graphic artist who came up with that
all right no graphic artist brought
that image to their boss nobody's that
bad
at being a graphic artist i'll tell you
what happened they brought him a picture
where they were balanced
and the editor said go back to the
drawing board that biden we can still
see it
we can still see a little biden in that
picture a little less biden
all right you know that happened right
you don't have to be
some mind reader to know it went down
just like that
because no graphic artist brings tiny
bite in giant kamala to the boss and
says how about this
that's not draft number one you know it
right
yeah that's not first draft
all right um
the i feel like republicans are totally
falling into a trap i think president
trump has fallen into this trap
already and certainly all the supporters
and here's the trap if you're attacking
harris for her
presumed sexual whatever past and the
willy brown stuff and
ha ha ha she slept her way to the top
first of all you're not a good person
all right yeah
it's a subjective it's a subjective
thing
but in my opinion you're not really a
good person if you're going
to that argument because there's enough
of an argument without that
and you wouldn't want it to be about you
right i mean if you reverse that
would you want to be running for office
and all they want to talk about is your
sexual past
no no it wouldn't be fair you wouldn't
want it to happen to your daughter
you wouldn't want to happen to your
mother you wouldn't want to happen to
your wife
your spouse you wouldn't want it to
 happen to anybody
so if you're doing it you know if you're
part of that
hahaha it's funny okay i get it
you know it's funny for about a minute
but really
it would be really helpful to get off of
that quickly
because it just is too easy for the
too easy for the democrats and they're
already doing it to say
well it looks like it's misogyny all the
way around all the republicans are
misogynist
looks like that president's being
misogynist because the way he talks
about harris is not the way he talks
about men
which you could argue but the president
does like to use this word
nasty nasty
now here's where he's he's
clever but maybe a little too clever in
this case
it's what the president is
superb at using imagery and words and
stuff
that set your brain on fire but if you
looked at it specifically there's
nothing wrong with it
right the word nasty was not invented as
a gender specific insult
you know there's nobody who can't be
nasty you could be
male female you know there's no gender
assumption in nasty but the democrats
have decided that there is
now it could be that there's not there's
no history of trump using that word
against
men i don't know maybe yes maybe no but
it feels like
it's being used because she's a woman
but it's a really
it's really good word because nasty is
one of those words
like dark that you can read into it
whatever you wanted to put into it
you know dark well what's dark well his
attitude
the way he talks uh the policies are
everything fits into dark
but likewise there's a lot of stuff that
fits into nasty
so in terms of persuasion it's a really
good word
it's a really good word but the counter
to it
is a little bit better which is hey you
wouldn't use that word with a man
which is a pretty good counter if you're
already primed
to believe there's some misogyny going
on
so i would i would uh i would
advise all of you to
just let that go all right first of all
to be good people
right you don't you don't want to stump
you don't want to
lower yourself to your enemies level
that's you know i can see sometimes that
might make sense
but i don't think you buy you're not
buying anything by doing it
you know if you had something to gain by
doing it well maybe
but there's not just nothing to gain on
this
um the democrats are trying to figure
out
how best to protect harrison biden
and i don't think they've decided yet if
calling her a pragmatic
moderate i think i think that's the way
they're going to go
they're going to try to sell harris as a
pragmatic
moderate but but
the right is selling her as a you know
wild
leftist with the most progressive you
know ideas etc
which one of those is true is it true
that harris is a pragmatic moderate
or is it true that she is a wild lefty
what do you think what what is your
honest opinion if you were to take
take the politics out forget which team
you're on for a moment
and you're just saying all right all
right i'll be as objective as possible
you know imagine it from 30 000 feet i'm
an alien i just came to earth i don't
have any biases or opinions
i'm just going to look at what she says
and does
does harris look like a pragmatic
moderate
or a wild lefty
pragmatic moderate in my opinion
and when i mean pragmatic i mean she'll
take whatever position
she thinks will get her elected so you
can't get more pragmatic than that
in my opinion she has no commitment
whatsoever to the far left
she has a commitment to ambition
she has a commitment to winning she has
commitment to herself
you know she may have some some good
feelings about the country too i don't
know
can't read her mind um but
you know the the attack that she is a
wild lefty
it probably works on the right in other
words republicans are certainly
they're primed to believe that anything
that she wants to do that republicans
don't
want to do will feel like it's too far
left so
so i think that framing works for the
republicans and i think the
but here's the question the democrats
the democrats are trying to frame her in
a way that can get her elected
if you are part of the bernie sanders
crowd
do you want to hear that she's a
pragmatic moderate
because i've got a feeling that the
the bernie people are just gonna just
gonna stay home
i don't know that they'll vote for trump
but i don't think they're gonna come out
and vote for the pragmatic moderate
because that's exactly what they didn't
want
that's as close to what they didn't want
as anything could be
now will they say yeah but you know it's
better than trump
they might but how how enthusiastic are
you
for yeah i fought really hard for bernie
and these
really leftist policies but man i'm
gonna get up early and i'm gonna
you know brave the coronavirus or i'm
gonna fill out my mail ballot or
whatever i'm going to do
to get that pragmatic moderate in there
i don't know i i just don't doesn't feel
inspiring to me
so i've got a feeling that's going to
hurt them
here's a wild card that was suggested to
me
uh i'm not going to give credit to
people who send me
dms and don't if i if i use your idea
that you dm'd to me
just take the happiness that the idea
um you know made it into the periscope
because if i haven't asked you if i can
mention your name i don't want to do it
and and i usually forget to ask that
question
so here's a thought from it's not an
original thought the the id the idea is
that the
young women um who are democrats
are seeing biden as a creepy old man
with a younger woman
and as soon as i heard that i thought to
myself
oh snap
think about it creepy old man with a
younger woman
now i know what you're thinking
i know what you're thinking you're
saying scott that might be a topic you
know just a little bit about
okay i get it yes i do have a much
younger wife uh and i can tell you
that my experience no surprise
is that there's a segment of the
population who really
really hates that i don't know exactly
why
you know you'd have to open up their
brains and do a brain scan and figure
out what's going on there
but there is something incredibly
triggering
in a bad way when an older man
and a younger woman are certainly if
they're
married or they're you know together but
even though a vice president and a
president are not in any kind of a
you know personal relationship of that
sort
does it feel like it kind of feels like
it
is my cat's tail going by oh perfect
yeah just leave it right there oh that
works yeah
uh if you're listening to this on the
audio only
my face was temporarily replaced by a
giant
cat tail all right so i've got a feeling
that this whole
old man creepy old man with younger
woman
thing is kind of a turn off for a
certain number of democrats
uh and we'll see if that makes a
difference
i think it might all right
have you noticed that president trump uh
when he
gives his briefings about the
coronavirus have you noticed that he's
he started to put the united states
progress
in the context of uh how we're doing
compared to europe
have you heard that now i'm assuming
that the numbers he's talking about in
terms of europe's
experience versus the united states are
you know in the ballpark meaning that if
you compare
europe as a whole not country to country
but
compare them as a whole the president is
making the point that they're having
a renewed problem there's some kind of
second wave situation happening
and that we're actually doing well
compared to europe
i haven't seen the fact checkers
disagree with that
and i imagine they would right that
would be at the top of the things they
would disagree with if it were not true
and i've i've given up on trying to look
at data
anytime you try to google well is that
true let me
let me google whether europe is doing
better or worse in the united states
you can find information but you can't
find anything you trust
at least if you're me so you'll find
competing information
you'll find stuff that's a month old
you'll find stuff about
one country you'll find stuff that
measures things a different way in the
united states
but it's not really
i won't say it's impossible but it's
nearly impossible
to go research anything yourself because
there's just too much noise out there
in the data so anyway
i think it's smart of the president to
compare himself to these other countries
because i as i predicted a while ago
they were doing well compared to the
united states for a while
but what changed you knew it was going
to change
all right here's a criticism
of the administration for those of you
who say
scott scott scott why do you only say
good things about
the trump administration a i don't
i don't i have plenty of criticisms
i do talk more about what they do right
and i do defend them more than i
criticize
but that's because the criticism part is
so well taken care of
like you don't need another person to
point out
the same thing that's all the headlines
you don't need that
for me so i like to show you the view
that's
you know less expressed and here's my
criticism
there's uh i've talked about this before
there's the idea that we already have
the technology and
it would be easy to ramp up for these
cheap over-the-counter
paper strip tests for coronavirus
now apparently these are a good test
which will tell you if you currently
have the virus
versus used to have the virus and only
have antibodies
so that's the first thing you have to
understand that these cheap
could be even one dollar cheap little
tests
will will tell you if you have it as
opposed to
will tell you if you used to have it so
that's the first advantage
second advantage is you get your answer
in a few minutes
meaning that you could do it every day
you could test yourself before you left
the house you could test yourself
be in the lobby of your employer
you could test yourself before you go to
the sporting event so if it only costs a
dollar
and you get your answer really quickly
that's pretty darn good right i mean you
could imagine that that would lower the
the the r was the r
zero or whatever they call it it would
it would lower the transmission rate
enough that we'd really get on top of
this thing it wouldn't make it go away
but it we could really get on top of it
now the critics say
but but buttscott it doesn't this type
of test
won't pick up the virus when you're
asymptomatic for like a day
that first day to which i say that's
right
it gets all the other times when you're
the most
spready but it will miss you know we
know this it doesn't get that first
day because you don't have enough i
guess whatever
to detect it but it doesn't matter if
you got
80 percent of the ident if eighty
percent of the time you were right
that would be the best thing ever so if
you're saying so the first thing you
yeah are not sorry that's what it's
called the r instead of r zero
or not let's be let's be scientific
about it
so the first thing you need to know is
that these paper strips
could be only eighty percent um
getting it right the twenty percent is
wrong
is because it's just too early
if you could create a test that could do
that for one dollar
widely available and immediate response
it doesn't
matter that you only get 80 percent of
it
doesn't matter that is so good
that if you're doing this much testing
you would just stamp out the virus
probably in a couple weeks
you know if if it were ubiquitous
so here's my question so this this idea
i
i can tell you from personal knowledge
has been promoted up through the
administration
so the administration is completely
aware of this option
there's some kind of fda thing that
makes it impractical
so private industry can't just go ahead
and do it right so there are private
companies
who could just ramp up and do this they
have the technology
the ramping up isn't that hard it's
paper strips oh and if you're worried
about
privacy this is a test you give yourself
unless you're trying to get into an
event and then of course
you know that would be different but
it's a test you give yourself so
you nobody has to know what your result
is unless you tell them
so the administration knows about this
option and we have heard
nothing about whether they like it and
nothing about whether they don't
and nothing about what they may or may
not do about it
now i'm not going to say that i know
this is the great answer and that i've
considered everything and i know all the
context
and i know what's good or bad about this
i don't i'm just saying that our
administration
is failing us at the moment on this
question
because we don't have an answer at the
very least
i need somebody like the president or
ideally more like you know the head of
the fda i want somebody who's
probably the head of the fda to say this
test exists
or it could exist you could ramp up and
then tell us
why it's not already a thing if you're
working on it
please tell us like if it's going to
happen in a week you know there's going
to be some change to make this possible
please tell us that would be the biggest
 thing you could tell us
if you're not going to do it and there's
a reason
 tell us i just want to know the
reason
i don't need it to be right i don't need
it to be the solution if it's not
i don't want you to lie to me i just
need to know where we're at
and so there's this big black hole where
this is
according to the people who have looked
at it the most
obvious rampable
practical completely doable solution
that would make this whole
pandemic go away
if it's real but what if it's not real i
need to know that too
we need to know if it's not real
just tell us where you're at fda
all right because without
without that feedback again the fda
might be completely right
right so i'm not ruling out the option
that the fda has looked at it
and judged that it's a bad option they
have their reasons
and it hasn't been communicated failure
that is a failure because you gotta
 communicate it
all right we're all in this like if you
think the public
is not fully engaged in this
pandemic
think again right fda you're not you're
not like
operating in some little satellite out
there you're connected to the
public
and we need just an answer just
tell us is this
is this a thing or is it not a thing
just inform us
all right
um i guess that's just about what i
wanted to cover today
if the paper test is now somebody's
saying
reliable for the paper test i'd like to
get the
the language correct because i've been
corrected on it and i think it's helpful
when you're talking about the test don't
don't think of it in terms of
accurate or not accurate or reliable or
not reliable
it's very reliable for the thing it does
so for the thing it does it's really
good yet the thing it does is pick up a
virus after that first day or so what it
doesn't do
is it's not designed that it could pick
up that first day
but you don't need it to solve the
problem you you could you could miss
that first day
every time that's the proposition you
would miss it every time
but you would get the other stuff really
really well
and that would be all you need all right
uh yeah we talked about my neighbor you
missed that part
so here's something amazing so every
time i see
an alex berenson tweet
about masks you know being unproven
it's making me crazy because i think to
myself
how do we not know i tweeted this
yesterday
how do we not know now whether masks
help
and i thought to myself this is just
crazy this this
berenson guy keeps tweeting that you
know to the effect that we don't have
any information that masks work
and i'm thinking that can't be possible
i mean certainly it was possible in the
beginning but
five months in we don't know for sure
and here's what's going on i think
the first thing that i think is going on
is that people are looking at these
various
lab studies the lab studies are all
 all of them 100
of them are all right so if you
saw a study that said
that these mass stop these you know
water particles or whatever and so
therefore mass are good
that that study is if you saw
the opposite
that there was a study that said that
the particles get through
or it makes it even worse or they're
getting out through the edges or
something
and in the lab they showed that that's
true that study
is complete all right so
whether or not
the lab study showed it works
or the lab study showed it doesn't work
they're all none of that should
be taken as credible
because they don't test it in the real
world basically they're just saying
some droplets came out or some droplets
didn't or we measured this
we measured that but what they don't
tell you
is that in every case the covering is
going to change at least the direction
of where stuff is going at the very
least
it's you know filtering it to the side
or whatever
at the very least it's changing the
viral load
i mean even if all it did was distribute
it as opposed to
send it directly into the mouth and eyes
of the person you're talking to
if that's all it did probably would you
know distribute the load
and none of these things are tested in
the lab tests right
the lab tests are all just a looking in
one window
of the taj mahal that's it every one of
them looks in one window
and they go all right well i guess i
know what the taj mahal is i'm looking
in
the one window and it looks like the taj
mahal is a it's a men's room
yeah it looks like that's a bathroom in
there
if you're only looking through one
window you don't know anything that's
where all the lab tests are
the only thing that would convince me is
real world usage where somehow you could
say
this group is exactly like this other
group
that's the hard part right getting any
two comparable groups and say well they
use masks
and look how well it did they didn't use
mass and look how well it did
now the next thing that people do is
they'll send me this one country
or one state they'll say look at this
one state
here's where they put the masks here's
where it didn't work
do you know what is also useless sending
me one state
every time you see a graph of one state
or two or three you know anything in the
small numbers
and it says here's the masks this day is
when they were mandatory
and look infections still went up then
you don't understand how to look at data
because all you've seen is that things
are getting worse
you don't know what the mask did if the
if you didn't have masks would that
curve be even worse
that's the question if you don't know if
it would be even worse
without the mask you don't know anything
you don't know anything here's what i
would find convincing
all of the countries that you know did
masks somehow
putting them in a bucket all the states
all the countries
the the mask people put them in one
bucket and all together
so you're not seeing just the the
weirdest of any one country or the
weirdest of any one state
compare that to all the places that
didn't do masks
and just show me the two curves all
right if you can adjust them by time i
guess you'd have to do that
because everybody's sort of on their own
schedule there so if you could do that
would that whole entire giant basket of
people using masks
have a noticeably different curve
collectively than all the ones who
didn't use masks
or yeah i guess that would be the best
way
now if you show me that and they don't
look that much different
well i i would i would say that would be
pretty convincing
if you showed me that and there is a big
difference
i'd say okay well there it is you know
that that's not
a controlled clinical trial but in the
same
for the same reason that
hydroxychloroquine you don't know if it
works
we you know i don't know i put it at 30
chance that it's a big deal but it's
still worth taking
it because the risk is so low right so
if you have a low risk
and yes yes i know you know there are
people who can have problems with the
masks
i know you you know the dentist has the
fellow smell problem
i know it keeps the bacteria close to
your face i know the mask can get
affected i know you might touch your
face
but if if it shows overall that the
masks are making a difference on the
pandemic i would consider that
important and i i think it's astonishing
that we're still having this
conversation five months in
so here's my take on it i don't know if
masks work
it seems to me obvious they do but but
being obvious that something works is
different than being scientifically true
and proven we all agree
that you can be easily fooled just by
looking at stuff
right that's not science science is not
saying well it looks like it'd work
but your reason should tell you
that at the very least it's keeping your
exhalations a little bit local and if
they're floating in the air afterwards
they're probably
dispersed and probably a lower viral
load and if masked don't work
well i'd be very surprised wouldn't be
impossible
i don't rule it out i don't rule it out
this sunday we'll find
that mass made things worse i just think
it's a small chance
if i had to put the odds on it i would
say
95 chance the mass are helping in an
important way
five percent chance that we got it all
wrong that's the odds i'd put on it
would just you know observationally so
i'm just amazed that we don't even know
that if there's one thing we've learned
from this whole coronavirus thing is
that we can't trust
any of the studies you can't trust any
of the experts
and everything you think is true is
going to be untrue tomorrow
and take that thinking over to climate
change
because it's the same conversation now
by the way
for however many years i've argued that
we can't do you know useful models of
the future
80 years in the future for climate
change most people who have not done
data analysis for a living i would think
or have not been close to it anyway
would think maybe i'm wrong maybe you
could do an 80 year old
an 80-year projection about temperature
and how that will affect the world
maybe you could and you would not be an
idiot
for thinking maybe that was possible you
would just be somebody who had
a different kind of experience in life
right i've done projections
anybody else who's done this kind of
work knows it's not a thing it's not
even close to a thing
it's not in the neighborhood of being a
thing
it's nowhere near a thing but it's
presented as a thing
now once the coronavirus has i think
uh ruined all of us in terms of trusting
data
trusting scientists trusting the
consensus
trusting you know individuals or
organizations
trusting the government trusting
anything we've just learned
that literally nothing can be trusted in
the scientific or political realm
nothing but will we take that
understanding
in the gel man amnesia way will we take
what we learned
in this coronavirus situation about the
undependability
of projections will we take that to
climate change
evidence suggests that most people won't
that they won't make the leap that
they're they won't have the
sophistication to say
you know everything was wrong about the
coronavirus
just everything every person every
organization
every model every everything it was all
wrong
oh but this climb has changed stuff we
got that nailed
got that nailed lucky we got this stuff
right
but the one time you can really see if
it's right or wrong
it's all wrong really that's just a
coincidence right
the one time you can clearly know
if the experts were right or wrong they
were wrong as much as they were right
coincidence well could be the fog of war
but i don't think that explains it
totally
you know i i'm not i'm not on the anti
fouchy train because there there's a
mind reading element to that that i'm
not comfortable with the any anything
against defauchi
in my opinion rests on the assumption
that
he had bad intentions you know some
financial
connection or bad intentions i just
don't feel that's an evidence
and assuming that he's feeling that way
or secretly thinking that way
is not a standard i would put on anybody
else i wouldn't put it on him
and the fact that you know he was wrong
about some stuff
i told you from the beginning on day one
of the
you know when we knew this coronavirus
thing was going to be a big deal
very early on i made a really big deal
of saying
i want to tell you now that our leaders
are going to make a lot of mistakes
and you shouldn't blame them because
nobody knows the right thing to do
later we'll know what was the right
thing to do and then we'll think we're
all geniuses because we looked
in the past and say
well why didn't he know why did he know
and of course nobody knew there was
always going to be somebody who guessed
right all right if you take a bunch of
marbles
and you know you've got a circle drawn
on the ground
you just drop your marbles some will
land in the circle
some will land outside the circle
because they'll roll
if it turned out later that being inside
the circle was better than outside the
circle
were the marbles that were inside the
circle the smart marbles
no marbles are not smart they just ended
up where they ended up
and likewise leaders around the country
took their best guess they took their
best guess
some of them were going to be right and
or right er
and some of them were going to be wrong
or wronger
just like the marbles and at the end
were
because we're humans we will attribute
genius to the ones who land the marbles
that landed inside the circle
we'll say hey look it's pretty obvious
the marbles that were inside the circle
are the good leaders
those are the good leaders because they
picked the right place to be no they
didn't
it was random people were guessing some
of them got it right
they're not the smart ones the ones who
corrected
are the good leaders so if you're if
you're looking for a skill
look for the people who got it wrong and
then correct it
and i'm going to surprise you boris
johnson
it looks like you know this is this
might change in time
so just current snapshot it looks like
boris johnson
got it completely wrong meaning that you
know he was going to go for herd
like sweden but then they reversed
course
quite dramatically they reverse course
it looks like the reversing of the
course
was better don't know yet we you know we
could be
we could find out that maybe they should
have just gone for heard but at the
moment
it looks like they made a bad decision
at first
and that they corrected it so who's
who's the good
leader is the good leader who made the
right decision
first or the one who corrected
i kind of like the one who corrects
right
you don't want to be on the team that
got it wrong and then had to correct
wouldn't you rather be on the team that
got it right but you have to realize
nobody knew what to do
so the boris johnson approach if indeed
history proves that it was very wrong in
the beginning
but they did adjust i would look at the
adjustment
to look for the leadership that's where
i would look for the leadership
so i'm not willing to throw boris
johnson under the bus
or any of the other leaders let's wait
to see how this turns out
and let's be a little bit forgiving
about the leaders who got it wrong but
the correcting
oh yeah you want to look at the
correcting and you want to make sure
they got that right
all right it's amazing that the russians
were
first to get the vaccination well that's
not amazing if you imagine that they
if you imagine that they cut corners um
so i'm being
uh prompted in the comments
to mention canon hinnot
the i guess the story is the little
five-year-old or something who got
murdered by
the neighbor now i think this story
the the reason that conservatives or
pro-jumpers
are pushing that story is because you
know they say hey how come this is not a
national story
because it was a black man neighbor who
assassinated basically just walked up to
a little kid with a gun and just killed
him
that's the story allegedly and
and then the complaint is why is
why is the national media not covering
it
and i would argue why should they
it's a i don't agree with the argument
it's a good political argument
if you want to push the argument for
political reasons you know it's a
political season
um but in my opinion it is
not national news it is a tragedy that
doesn't have
a political element to it that i can see
if somebody gets murdered wearing a maga
hat
well then that's also that's a tragedy
but it's also a national story because
it connects to politics
but uh one one child tragically murdered
by a neighbor
does it matter that the neighbor is a
different ethnicity
i don't why should it i mean we don't
know
what was going on there but it looks
like a mental health problem right
so to me it just looks like a mental
health problem that doesn't connect to
any larger
larger issue so we can be horrified by
it
we can be informed by it but you
shouldn't take it as a
as some larger political thing
that's what i think all right somebody
says a peace deal is going on
a peace deal between israel and the uae
interesting interesting
okay
i'll check up on that it does seem like
that israel may be taking advantage of
the coronavirus
to get some stuff done and but when i
say take advantage of being in a good
way
it looks like a lot of iranian military
assets are
catching on fire a lot of hezbollah's
assets seem to be blowing up
so i think israel is mopping up things
and doing a good job of it
all right oh at the moment the slaughter
meter's 100
100 i can't see from this
perspective trump losing or
even coming close to losing i just don't
see it
um but it's a lot still a long time till
november
so you know the the slaughter meter
specifically excludes surprises
right and there will be surprises so you
can't use it as a prediction
but it's fun
yeah the george floyd thing was
political because of the issue of
police blah blah
uh and somebody says if you reverse the
ethnicities
would it then be a national story not my
opinion
no because in both cases it would be a
mental health story
it's not a political story
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
later
