hello james
hello donna hello
chris tyler and
fleed come on in here
oh i hope all of you are having a good
day
my day is not so good but i'll tell you
about that in a minute
[Music]
so let's talk about fentanyl
but before we do please join me
for the simultaneous sip grab your cup
your mug your beverage
bring it to your lips
so you've heard of fentanyl
it's a painkiller very powerful
painkiller but this is a very small
margin between
killing your pain and killing the person
as a result fentanyl is the number one
drug overdose killer in the united
states i think 72
000 people died of drug overdoses
last year in the united states 72
000 people 72
000 people died of a drug overdose
in the united states last year fentanyl
number one
cause by far fentanyl is the top cause
i believe it was the cause of prince's
death
i believe it was the cause of michael
jackson's death
and the interesting thing is that
china is apparently the main source of
the illegal
flow now that's what the united states
says china says not so much
but you would sort of expect that now
the president tweeted back in august
that china was the major source of
fentanyl
and um he you know called on china to do
more
and actually i think he referred to it
as almost a form of warfare or
some people have now if another country
was shipping something to us that was
killing
let's say thirty thousand dollars thirty
thousand people a year
doesn't that look like a war because i
believe
vietnam only took 50 000 american lives
or a lot many more were injured
but i think the entire vietnam war
killed 50 000
americans fentanyl from
china from china
uh probably killed five times that many
eric bowling's son you say
i wasn't aware that that's what killed
eric bowling's son
so yesterday morning
i did my periscope i think many of you
saw me
and at the end of the periscope right
after that i got a text message
and the text message said that there was
a 9-1-1
call on another line that's
on my verizon
um
ah
yesterday i got a call right after the
911 alert
from my ex-wife who told me that
my stepson the little boy that i raised
from the age of
two was dead
he died last night or maybe early in the
morning yesterday
we're not sure in his bed
from what appears to be a fentanyl
overdose
the coroners found a fentanyl patch
on his arm if you don't know what a
fentanyl patch is i didn't either
it's a little patch it's about this big
very small about the size of a postage
stamp
and it's very popular now among addicts
a little patch they put in their
shoulder and it feeds a continuous flow
of fentanyl now that may not have
been the actual thing that killed him
it could be that he was also trying to
get xanax
so we we have some information he was
trying to score some xanax
now if you don't know this topic
you're lucky but xanax is mostly
counterfeit
the xanax that the kids are doing the
addicts are doing
there's not really xanax it's
combinations of other drugs that people
are passing off as xanax
and close to 100 of them are
fake the one of the
prime ingredients that are in this fake
xanax
are fentanyl so there's a fairly good
likelihood that my stepson
justin now deceased
probably got two doses of fentanyl
yesterday
now we weren't surprised
because it had been a long battle with
addiction since he was 14.
he had a uh a very bad head injury when
he was 14 from a bicycle accident
and he was wearing a helmet but it was
still a bad accident
and his behavior changed after the
accident
he sort of lost
he sort of lost his ability to make good
decisions
i'm not sure he ever made great
decisions but he lost his impulse
control
he lost his he lost his fear
and in california if you reach a certain
size physically you know if a teenager
is a certain size
if you tell them to do something and
they don't do it
you have certain recourse but in
california you don't have much
so you can't physically restrain
somebody
and you also can't keep them from
getting drugs
so somebody would really have to want to
get better
and he never wanted to get better from
the time he started doing drugs he
wanted to do more drugs and that's all
he wanted
his quality of life he didn't think was
good enough
for a variety of reasons that didn't
have anything to do with
lifestyle
so i got to watch
my dead blue
bloated sun taken down on a stretcher
in front of his mother and biological
father
and because the law in california
there was actually nothing that we could
do
now in other states i understand that
you can actually commit
somebody you can you can have them
essentially locked up
in some kind of a rehab facility and if
they tried to walk out they just
couldn't
but in california if a kid wants to walk
out the door they just can't
and he would and did and you know he had
a few
well
so
um if i don't see myself for a while
you'll know why um
so fentanyl mostly from china i
understand
probably killed my son yesterday my
stepson
so as we're negotiating with china
you know i hope we can we can do
something about that problem
i understand china is doing a little bit
in terms of
controlling some of the instrumentation
used to make these drugs
etc but here's my opinion
at this level of problem
if we the united states know which
chinese executives are behind this
and i would i would bet we do by now we
probably know which specific
pharmaceutical companies are making the
drug
because they're made by i believe
they're made by actual
legitimate incorporated type companies
in china but they of course know that
there's
big leakage and i'm sure that that's
good for their profits
but if we know who those chinese
executives are
i would like to call for their execution
now in china if you mess up
you know if you're a chinese executive
of a company and you
let's say you you do something where you
steal some money or you cross the
government in some way
they'll actually just take you out and
kill you you know that
i'm not even sure they have due process
in in the usual way
so i'd like to offer to china
to president xi who i do respect
that to give him first first chance
to take care of the problem himself
if you don't i think we can hold china
responsible
for perhaps 30 000 deaths per year
in this country so in a very real way we
are at
war with china in sort of an indirect
way
not with the government per se
but i would be in favor of our
cia or our dark
intelligence people going after those
executives directly
even at the at the price of substantial
international problems so
i'm calling for the the death of the
um executives of those chinese companies
who we believe are not doing enough
now i don't have all the details if it
turns out that they are doing enough
our government probably can tell the
difference
they can probably tell the difference
between trying and not trying
but if they're not trying i think
president xi should
for the benefit of international
relations
for the benefit of being a
being a legitimate international power
i think president xi needs to start
executing people in his own country
if he does i think that would be a great
step and if he doesn't
i would be in favor of our country
directly executing chinese citizens
now ideally we don't want to get caught
but i'm pretty sure we know how to kill
people without getting caught
so those folks who
may be directly or indirectly
responsible for the death of my stepson
um i'd like to see you die
and i'll see what i can do to make that
happen
so um
just a little bit more on this and then
we'll talk about some other headlines
because
life does go on
[Music]
the um
the other observation is that uh
and i think jordan peterson says this
he talks about the complexity of life
and how
as as life is getting harder to navigate
it's just more complicated
p certain people in the society are
being left behind
uh they're being left behind
and my stepson was one he was not well
equipped to deal with the
modern world but if you ever saw him
with drugs in him you knew that
once he had the drugs in him the drugs
were his personality
he didn't really have an independent
personality and then he took drugs
the drugs were him you know he sort of
became the drugs
and he would be almost a monster
he was he was 18.
um
and so if you don't have any personal
experience
with opioid addiction it doesn't look
like anything else you've ever seen
it turns people into walking zombies
who quite clearly are not in their own
mind and are not in control of their
actions somebody says it's murder
it's murder to kill chinese executives
pharmaceutical companies just because
they're killing
30 000 people in this country a
year 30
000 30 000
roughly it's you know maybe more than
that might be less than that
but do i want to kill somebody who might
be responsible for
30 000 american deaths a year yeah i do
yes i do legally legally or illegally
i do want them dead um
and so i want the government to know you
have my support
if you kill them and you get caught you
have my support
um for what that's worth which isn't
much all right
i've said enough about that topic i'm
going to change topics
um california
just passed some kind of law that
requires that
public companies that are housed in
california that are
you know their home base can no longer
have
all male boards can't have all male
boards in california if you're a public
company
and your headquarters in california
and i had two reactions to that
reaction number one it'd be good to have
more
gender diversity sounds like a good idea
reaction number two california is really
the
the i guess the vanguard of the democrat
party wouldn't you say if you said name
one one state that you think
democrat it would be california
so california so the democrats have this
branding
evolution going on in which they try to
be for all people
but the the practical reality
is that they're very um
female focused so the the democratic
party democrats
are basically a party of women who also
include other people
and when you see a law passed in
california that says yeah we're going to
make sure by law
that you diversify your boards by gender
which again i think gender
diversification is a very good thing
let's have some more of that but my
question is this
what do black men think when they hear
this
if you're a black male democrat
or a hispanic male democrat
what do you think of the fact that the
law just required
women to be on boards but not you
not there's no requirement for uh
ethnic diversity why not
now it might be just a practical problem
it could be just
yeah it would just be too hard to do
there are too many ethnicities how could
you possibly do it
let's start somewhere you know maybe we
want to get that but you've got to start
somewhere
those would all be good reasons for at
least
rationalizations for for why
the focus does on women but i'm not
really talking about that
my my larger point about that is
how can democrats possibly win another
national election when their priorities
are so clearly
a woman focused and
it appears to me completely ignoring a
huge part of their base which is
black americans hispanic americans etc
so i see that as a real problem then at
the same time
rosie o'donnell prominent democrat
prominent anti-trumper
has made some uh gay slurs about
uh graham lindsey graham
so rosie o'donnell i guess was a tweet
said some
anti-gold anti-gay slur now
rosie o'donnell is a member of the lbgtq
community
so it's not the same if it comes from
her right so you can't say that
if somebody that's in the community
makes a slur about somebody in the
community it sounds the same as if
somebody outside
the community makes this so i won't make
that case
but it did make me think
that i'm having trouble remembering the
last time i saw
a conservative make an anti-gay slur
and maybe it could be just my filter is
off so i'll make this as more of a
question than
than a statement doesn't it seem to you
[Music]
that conservatives and republicans and
trump supporters
don't make anti-gay slurs
now i i don't mean that as an absolute
so i'm talking about
public discourse i'm not talking about
what anybody says in private
obviously people are anti-everything in
private
but it made me think when when rosie
o'donnell was accused of making an
anti-gay slur which again i don't think
is a big deal
because she's she's part of the lgbtq
in in crowd so that's not the same kind
of insult it would be if it came from
the outside
but it made me think conservatives
don't really give a rat's
ass about the entire
gender preference thing i i don't think
i've ever met
a conservative who said anti-gay things
in the past
i don't know three four years something
like that it feels like as an issue
we just disappeared
so you know when we're looking at all
the bad news
consider the good news
um
i understand that uh uh gillum
so candidate gillum who's running for
what's what's he running for he's
running for
um running for a governor of florida
right
one of his staffers got fired for
wearing a shirt
about the assassination of president
trump
now of course it makes sense that you're
going to fire your staffer for wearing a
shirt
that advocates assassination of the
president
so no this is no criticism of gillum for
having a staffer that thinks like a lot
of other people
and no criticism that he fired the
staffer for going over the line
the part of the story that is just
jaw-dropping is that the staffer
wore that wore that shirt in the first
place
imagine imagine being so deeply in your
bubble
that you think you can put a shirt on
advocating the assassination of the
president of the united states
wear it in public and the people would
say yeah
that guy
so it tells you how deeply people are
you know people are diluted on both
sides it's not it's not limited to one
side
but when you see it like that in such
stark relief
it uh it's astonishing
um let's took i i saw a
headline that says that steve bannon
was speculating about who might run
against trump in 2020
and i didn't read the whole headline
because the the summary
the summary gave away the story but the
the summary is that steve bannon is
predicting that avenatti
might be the one the the democrats run
against
trump now
i found that amusing here's why
i don't think there's a smallest chance
that bannon thinks avenatti is going to
run against trump
i don't think he actually thinks there's
any chance that's going to happen
but the fact that bannon put that out
there
just he sort of pushed avenatti
forward as you know the the banner the
standard bearer
for the democrats
is kind of hilarious all right
he was on uh bill maher it's kind of
hilarious
because to the extent to the degree that
people believed him
believed that he was serious it would it
would raise avenatti's profile
and there's nothing that is less likely
for the democrats than to have another
white male
uh you know to be their standard bearer
there isn't there isn't the slightest
chance
that avenatti could ever be the
candidate for the democrats
at least not in 2020 who knows what
happens in 20 years
but uh i it was just hilarious and smart
and i gotta say that was that was like
one of the
most clever moves to put avenatti
out there as the uh as a standard bearer
for the
the other team let's talk about canada
you saw the big news canada has agreed
to a deal so now we have deal with
mexico on trade we have a deal with
canada on trade
i believe i told you early on that the
order of things
is that we would do you know it once
you've done mexico
and canada you've shown you have
demonstrated
and it's no longer a one-off because
it's now now they've done it twice
and i think they've also done south
korea so correct me if i'm wrong i think
japan is close have we completed
somebody fact-checked me on here as the
trump administration
completed three or four trade deals
so i'm thinking mexico canada um
south korea and then japan i don't know
where japan is if that's done
or still working but what i predicted
was
that trump would start lining up these
deals he would do the easy ones first
china of course is going to be the big
one we would expect that one to be last
but he will he will continue proving
through example that new deals can be
made
so the fact that mexico canada and south
korea have all made deals
and that the united states is
characterizing them as better deals than
before
and here's the weird part i believe the
other countries are also characterizing
them as better deals
because they have to even if it's not a
better deal for mexico
even if it's not a better deal for
canada even if it's not a better deal
for south korea
what are those governments going to tell
their own people
they're going to tell their own people i
did a good job for you my
own people i made a new deal with the
united states and it's better for us
even if it isn't so the way this has to
go
is that every country is going to see
that the countries that worked with us
and came to a better deal are telling
the world that working with us and
coming to a better deal
is better for them it's not just better
for the united states it's better for
them
is it true too complicated to know
it would be impossible for us to know
and even if we read it in the news we
wouldn't believe it
it's just too complicated to know if any
of these deals are good for any of the
countries involved
they're all sort of a wait and see but
on the persuasion level
both sides are going to claim victory
because that's what politicians do
now if you if you've racked up you know
a dozen trade deals in which every time
we do it
both sides the united states and whoever
we're dealing with
does a public statement says man i'm
sure glad we did this new deal with the
united states
because it's better it's better for our
people too
it's different but it's better
what's that do to the uh the politics in
china now china doesn't have to watch
its politics in exactly the same way
that a you know
a republic does or democracy does
but they still have to care because if
they're
if they're democrat i'm sorry if their
economy
suffers and the the people start
believing
that all you have to do is what these
other countries did just make a deal
because nobody in china is really is
going to understand the complexity of
the the chinese trade deals all they're
going to know
is wait a minute mexico made a deal and
they they say it's better
canada made a deal they say it's better
you made a deal someday
they say it's better you know great
britain made a deal they say it's better
what is wrong with our leadership when
everybody else can make a deal with the
united states
and proclaim it was an improvement why
can't china do that
now of course none of this is real
because we don't know what an
improvement looks like we really don't
we can hope it's better you know we can
improve it in the margins but we really
don't know how any of this plays out
but politically china is
is in this sort of vice right now that's
how
the the trump administration has them in
a vice and the vice is closing
and unless i'm missing something major
i don't see anything that would make it
easier for china going forward but i see
a lot of stuff that's going to make it
harder
i mean i i see nothing but more pressure
on china
until until we have a deal so
i would say that um trump's strategy
which everybody called crazy
is certainly starting to pan out now
here's the
here's the criticism that i just saw on
uh on twitter and i'll read this tweet
so here's a criticism on twitter from
random user
j uh jav durand
it says surreal watching trump cult
followers that's all of you you're the
trump
cult followers most of you anyway trash
canada
while swooning over trump kim love
affair
so here's a criticism this is this is
one of the best criticisms i've seen
so keep in mind this is one of the best
they don't have anything better than
this
that's the point it's their best
criticism and i'll read it again
that the trump cult of followers cult
cult
are trashing canada our friend
while swooning over trump and kim and
north korea is
you know sort of a friend of me now
i tweeted back as you might imagine i
would
i tweeted back and said to jay
to javdy which approach which approach
gets you better trade deals and a
denuclearized korean
peninsula being too nice to canada
and too mean to kim got us the opposite
figure out this puzzle and we'll let you
in the cult
after the hazing obviously so
here's the thing that trump understands
that for some reason other people didn't
understand
and i i think this has to be attributed
to the
the difference between a government
mentality
and a diplomat mentality so
trump was hired in large part because he
would bring a
you know a negotiating business person's
perspective to the job
as opposed to a diplomatic politically
correct perspective that was very
clearly laid out that was his
proposition
i will not be politically correct i will
not be
the friendly diplomat you're used to i'm
going to kick some ass
i'm going to get some deals but wait i'm
not a bad guy
because i'm tr i'm i'm pursuing a system
which is better for everybody i'm not
i'm not looking for a goal
which is to be happy here to have you
know to have better trade deals per se
i'm looking for a system a system is
that we compete as hard as we can
in a friendly competition and we say
what we're doing
we say we're trying to get the best deal
we can you canada
we expect you to negotiate like wounded
animals we expect you to do the hardest
negotiating you can
get the best deal you can and to screw
us as hard as you can
that's what we expect of you and we're
going to be doing the same
and this system where we both fight as
hard as we can
honestly and above board gets you to a
better place
capitalism compare that to
what this tweeter believed which is that
it was more important to say to stay
friendly with our friends
canada than it was to have a better
trade deal
that both canada and the united states
thinks is better
or at least they say they think it's
better
what trump knew is that negotiating hard
with your friends with your friends
doesn't break anything if you're honest
and you lay it out and you're above
board and you're not you're not a jerk
about it
and you you negotiate hard with your
friends
you're fine what do you do with your
enemies
the ones who have a nuke pointed at you
do you
do what diplomats in the past have done
which is say oh yeah
i dare you to shoot that nuked us we got
nukes we're gonna nuke you too
well of course trump did a little bit of
that too to frame things and make sure
he had a credible
threat but as soon as the credible
threat was established
he quickly moved to the smarter approach
which is
why the heck would we be enemies with a
country that has nuclear weapons
who wants to be an enemy with somebody
who has nuclear weapons
and by the way we don't want anything
out of north korea
we just want them to stop aiming their
nuclear weapons at us that's it
so trump made friends of our enemies
and he negotiated hard with our friends
that's what a business person does
what does a diplomat do the opposite a
diplomat does the opposite
what do the opposite get us bad trade
deals
and nuclear confrontation so
i'm fairly certain at this point i i
feel confident in saying this
president trump if you stop today
you know let's say he gets another
conservative on the court whether it's
kavanaugh or
someone else if after that after the
second supreme court nomination
if he left office today if he just said
you know i like golfing
i'm just gonna golf i'm gonna leave and
go golf
probably would be the most important
president in the last hundred years
if only because he brought a systems
approach
and a in sort of a business perspective
to the job
and once you've seen it you can't unsee
it
in other words every president who
follows this president
is going to have to answer to this
every president who doesn't negotiate
hard with
an ally country is going to have some
explaining to do
because trump just showed it works every
country that keeps
being let's say belligerent to somebody
who has nukes
russia china
north korea they've got some explaining
to do
because now we saw trump do it the other
way
and it looks like the results are better
so
trump did more than more than whatever
you're watching in terms of the economy
you know those things are good you know
you did more than the things he's doing
with um international relationships it's
much more than that
he brought a way of thinking an approach
a different system a
a business person's friendly competition
frame to it once you've seen it
you can never unsee it and it's never
been there before we've never seen it
before
now we've seen it it's permanent
let me give you an example until
nixon went to china those of you who
know your history
know that nixon was the most badass
anti-communist president
he was super hard on china but when he
had an opening
to go visit and maybe get things moving
in the right direction
he was the perfect person to do it
because he was so anti-china
that it was credible when he said hey
something's changed
and now we can you know maybe have
better relations
so once as soon as nixon did that
you can't unsee it everybody now
understands that being the nixon hard
ass
before you decide to um
to get friendly is a model that works
because now we've seen it can't unsee it
what did uh trump do with north korea
he did the he did the richard nixon play
why did he use the rich index and play
with north korea
you know we're gonna we're gonna be the
toughest on you than anybody's ever been
unless you want to be friends oh let's
be friends
right why did trump know that would work
well one reason is nixon did it
because he already saw it once you see
it
it's part of the part of the toolbox
so trump is adding tools to the toolbox
the same way nixon
added a tool to the toolbox so even if
nixon
you know went down in fl flames in terms
of his reputation and other things he
was bad for the economy
there were lots of bad things about
nixon obviously
but that one tool
that he introduced into the system is
permanent and
and trump is doing the same with a set
of tools
um let's talk about
jeff flake all of you know the jeff
flake
uh and he has the most ironic perfect
name in the simulation
he looked like he was going to vote for
kavanaugh but at the last minute he
sided with
chris goons his friend and democrat and
sided with other democrats to ask for a
one-week
investigation now he was asked i believe
on 60 minutes
if he could have done this had he not
been retiring
and flake said no way
he said all the incentives are against
it
if you want to keep your job you
actually can't do
what you think is right he said that
directly
clearly and unambiguously said no i
would not have done this
except that i'm leaving the job think
about that
the only person who made a difference
was the guy who's leaving
this this whole you know battle over
that not the nomination
in the end it came down to the one
person who was leaving
because that person was the only honest
broker now say what you will about flake
and i know he's got his haters
but he was the only honest player
in this whole saga and he said directly
that even he wouldn't have been honest
except that he's already quit
he has nothing to lose the only honest
person
what the hell does that tell you about
our system there was one honest person
but here's the good news there were you
know
several hundred liars who it turns out
didn't have any power because they
couldn't get their way there was only
one person who mattered
just one person one person who didn't
give a
so thank you jeff flake
i am in favor of the one week delay
because i i think that
it's reasonable now i know a lot of
people say i know it's reasonable
sounding
but they're gonna delay the delay and
it's really just a trick just like
kim jong-un is playing the president you
know you're you suckers don't you see
this play
it's just a trick well yes it is a trick
and it is a delay but they also painted
themselves in a corner by saying that a
week is all you need
you know they've been saying from the
start you just need a week all you need
is a week
so the president gave him a week what
did they say
they say of course of course they say
um they say we might not be long enough
so they need some out to be able to say
that the president narrowed
they say he narrow now they're saying
he's narrowing the investigation
to which i say don't you have to narrow
that investigation
the the day that you say it's only going
to take a week
[Music]
you've narrowed the investigation
because everybody knows you can't do
anything in a week
except talk to the same people you talk
to ask a few extra questions
so the democrats by pushing forward
this completely ridiculous standard
that something could be deeply
investigated in a week
because you know they did it once before
with anita hill
trump just accepted their standard and
said all right
i'll take you a week nothing's going to
happen
or well let me say that's not a
confident
prediction because something could
happen there's always there are always
surprises but i think that even if a new
allegation came up
uh you know a new thing that people
would discount it as
being too nakedly political so i think
uh
you know the president has a pretty good
chance of just getting through the week
and getting his nomination done we'll
see
um i'm seeing now and now of course the
goal posts have moved to the question of
whether kavanaugh lied
in his testimony on the little stuff
because if he lied on the little stuff
under oath
lying under oath is disqualifying but
here's the thing
lying under oath about things that would
simply embarrass other people
for no good reason and are not central
to the main
point of the main point of the
proceedings
doesn't look disqualifying to me
and i would say this if you know if the
parties were reversed
and and the judge was you know 35 years
of
exemplary incredible judge fair
lived a you know lived a a life that
people
would want to model if all that was true
and the
only thing you had to say about him is
that he lied on some trivial stuff
like let's say the meaning of the
yearbook statements
or how much he drank if those are the
only things he lied about
or maybe you know some trivial stuff
like that then
it wouldn't matter what party he was it
wouldn't matter what the
what the situation was i'd say
it just doesn't matter and indeed
it's true that if you lie under oath
about immaterial parts
you don't really get the same same
treatment as if you
lie about material things so i would say
that the things that he's accused of
lying about
clearly are immaterial
um somebody was just prompting me to say
something about
oh temperament so the word
temperament is being used a lot it was
used against president trump
saying he had a bad temperament and now
it's being used against kavanaugh
because he got
he got he got pretty worked up
um he got pretty worked up
uh about the you know
during his questioning and the question
i asked is this
society has largely agreed even if you
don't agree but
society has sort of the consensus is
that the word
hysterical when applied to any woman is
sexist
and i would agree with that that that
feels like a
a fair statement if we also accept that
some people don't know it
it's considered sexist so there are
probably a lot of people who use the
word hysterical
that are not thinking of it necessarily
in a sexist way
but they need to catch up right people
it is one of those words that was based
on
hysterectomy you know it's it has to do
with women
so historically it's a it's a
insulting term for women and i would
agree that that's true
but what i'm asking is this when do we
ever see
women accused of having a bad
temperament
have you ever seen that it feels like
temperament
is the word that people use against men
because you say well he's got a bad
temperament and he's big
he's a male so he's a little bit
dangerous i'd be afraid of that
temperament
so i would suggest that while his
hysteria
hysterical is an insulting sexist word
and you probably shouldn't use it if if
any woman is the subject of that word
um but i would suggest the same thing
about the word temperament
for men if you're if you're saying that
trump has a bad temperament kavanaugh
has a bad temperament
do we ever see that applied to a woman
and i can't remember any time i've seen
that word
applied to a woman now there may be
worse words you know that you might use
the b word and
other worse words that were sexist in
their own way but let's
you know let's uh let's have a fair
standard
um
goodbye troll let's have a fair standard
about use of words if some are sexist
maybe others are too
let's keep that in mind uh
all right here's here's my most
controversial but least
important point of the day i tweeted
around a little graph that showed that
the
percentage of young people who are still
living at home
uh spiked around tucson 2007 2008.
now of course the the cause of the
initial spike
is that the economy imploded
and so it was harder especially at the
low end of the jobs market
to get jobs so it makes perfect sense
that the number of people staying at
home skyrocketed uh
in 2008. but it also coincidentally
2007 is when the iphone came out
so the increase of people living at home
uh you know the start of it matches both
the iphone and
the bad economy and i think the bad
economy was of course
of course the main reason for the spike
so nobody's questioning the the main
reason
but even as the economy improved and uh
all obama lovers will tell you
that in the last you know four years of
the obama administration things were
going better
still that doesn't mean that the people
at the the low end
uh doesn't mean the people at the low
end are getting jobs
you know they may still not be getting
jobs that are good enough to move out of
the
mom's house so i get it
and i understand that the economy is the
major variable
causing the initial gigantic shift but
here's my hypothesis
and when i made the tweet i i had hoped
that people would see it as a
provocative question
and not some sign that i'd made a
conclusion about the one and only
variable
being iphones but of course people over
interpreted it and
the the trolls came after me so let me
let me clarify
here's my hypothesis
and and i'll just use this anecdote i
realize anecdotes don't
extend to the world but just to just to
paint the picture here
so when i moved to california
um and i had essentially no money i
rented a one room with no window
like literally a windowless room and
a bathroom that i shared with four other
people i think or something down the
hall
and that's all i could afford
because moving out of the house wasn't
optional i was definitely moving out of
the house
and i worked very hard because i didn't
like being in a windowless room
and so my life improved through hard
work and
you know i took classes and i i took
training courses and i did everything
that i could do
to um to be able to afford
slightly better places until i live in a
very
very nice place now and i was i was
asking myself
that what what was it that caused me
to work through that tough situation to
a better situation
and part of it is the pain there's a
degree of pain
that being poor inflicts on you because
you have no source of entertainment
you don't have any connection you can't
date you know if you don't have money
and you also don't have a smartphone
you're you don't have a social life you
know if you don't have a car
smartphone or money you know and you're
young
you don't have anything it's painful and
you'll work as hard as you can
and you'll put up with a lot to get out
of that situation
and into a better one now compare that
to
let's say a 20 something who who you
know
because of the job prospects hasn't left
the house yet
and they've got their smartphone and
their smartphone
is importing to them you know a form of
a
cyber social life it's insanely
stimulating
it it it's designed to stimulate the
same things as drugs
and they're getting just a continuous
flow of bam bam bam
this feels good well they're sitting at
home
they don't even have to shop mom is
making dinner
so they go from their you know their
nice room in their house
probably with their own bathroom play
with their phone all day
mom makes dinner you can use probably
use mom's car
or dad's car or you can get around you
can uber
you can date on timber tinder you don't
need any money because a tinder date
it's you know what couple drinks
so suddenly the the the motivation
for seeking pleasure and avoiding pain
went from you know when i was a kid to
really extreme motivation
to a kid today is going to have to leave
a worse situation to get to a better one
right all right let me see let me say
this i said that exactly opposite
a kid today with a smartphone living at
home has a pretty good quality of life
and if we know anything about human
behavior
it's that friction causes people to do
less of something
and and rewards costs cause people to do
more of something
now not every person exactly at the same
time and in the same way
but it's true in general so my
hypothesis is this
that even as the economy improves and
even if the economy improves
for the lower end the people who
couldn't leave the house
that they will never get back to the
level we were
because in the age of the smartphone
motivation
is just sucked out of the young because
they're already getting so much reward
without working so they should the other
incentive should be to milk it as much
as possible
so of course that will be different from
for every person in every situation
but as a general average the incentive
to leave home
is far less than it ever was and it
should make a difference
all right um
i believe that's all i want to talk
about today
um if you didn't see uh kanye
now named yay the little clip of him
talking at the end of saturday
night live you should i don't have much
to say about that now
but i will
i will go now because i'm looking at my
incoming messages and i need to make
some
funeral plans for my stepson
and i will talk to you all tomorrow
