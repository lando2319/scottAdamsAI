good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with scott adams and
may i say that this will be the best one
of all time
we're going to do the simultaneous sit
first and then let me tell you
it's going to go
skyrocketing after that skyrocketing i
tell you never better
and all you need to get this going is a
copper mug or a glass a tiger jealous
steiner can't enjoy a flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
puts a tingle on the back your neck
it's called the simultaneous sip
and a lot of simultaneous things are
going to happen right now go
um
yeah that was
that was perfect actually
so here's an update on my uh coved
quarantine situation update update
um
let's see so saturday was my first
symptoms and i tested positive with a
home test
today is wednesday
and
i feel not just a hundred percent better
but
better than i've ever been
and here's why
i realized
the other day because i had a little
online side conversation
that some part of long covid could be
confirmation bias
right
you think you can have these lasting
symptoms
then anything that ever happens to you
for the next 10 years you say well
it's because of the covent
am i right you're basically going to
imagine yourself into every symptom you
were going to have anyway
being long covered
now knowing that that's the case
what would be the defense
and i've employed what i call the
spider-man refrain
now i don't know if this will work yet
but
it seems to be working so far
and the spider-man reframe goes like
this
not every mutation
is bad
sometimes it's a superpower
and so instead of looking for whatever
you know negative health consequences i
might have in the future and saying well
i think there's my long covert kicking
in
i'm going to look for anything that
looks like things are going a little
extra well for me
and i'm going to say
i i think that's from the covid
for example just today i was thinking
is it just me or do i look a little
extra sexy today
and i thought
it's not my imagination
it's the long coved is starting to kick
in with some benefits
that's the first one i mean that's the
obvious one probably a lot of you
noticed as soon as you signed on
you're thinking what is it is he why is
he a little bit sexier did something
happen yeah yeah it's called long covet
spiderman edition
superpowers
now you're also saying why is he funnier
why is this a better show today
same reason
same reason
long covet spider-man edition
now some people are going to get the you
know the
low energy and the i don't know all
kinds of bad things supposedly
and they are not framing this right
they're creating the wrong future for
them themselves in this simulation
so
if as we go on it seems to you that i'm
smarter better adjusted happier
uh or any of those things it's not your
imagination
that's the long covet
cake it in
spider-man in addition
all right
um
have you noticed that uh
whoever it is that's in control of the
truth
uh would love to also limit
hate speech
that's a dangerous combination isn't it
because if i just said to you hey
maybe we should have less hate speech
and that that's the only variable yeah
less hate speech that's good your first
instinct might be
i'd like a little less hate speech
but
what if somebody else is in charge of
deciding what the hate speech is
well then suddenly it's the worst thing
in the world
so rasmussen did a little poll here and
said
found out that 58 percent of democrats
say the federal government should take
action to suppress
online hate speech
uh but that that view is shared by only
31 percent of republicans and voters not
affiliated with either
major party so 58 percent of democrats
want the federal government
to do more about hate speech
now
democrats are also the ones who sort of
are in charge of the government or a lot
of it
so
wouldn't this be the worst thing in the
world
you just can't have these two things at
the same time
well maybe you just need free speech and
that's that's the end of that
conversation
so and and also
i saw a tweet by the rasmussen
account which you should be following
rasmussen reports
um
and uh
this was abe lincoln right this quote
you can fool all the people some of the
time and some of the people all the time
but you cannot fool all the people all
the time
and i thought to myself that needs to be
updated a little bit
see if he can tell what's missing
right it was probably pretty clever back
when lincoln said it and i imagine if
i'd been there i would say
whoa well said well said abe
if i had been there at the time
but it doesn't age well
it didn't age well i'll tell you why so
i'll give it to you again see if you can
hear it what is missing from this
quote you can fool all the people some
of the time and some of the people all
the time but you cannot fool all the
people all the time well i'll tell you
what's missing
the most important part which matters
today
you only need to fool half of the people
all the time
and that's kind of easy
you only need to fool half the people
and unfortunately you can do that all
the time
we just won't agree which half it is
i'm pretty sure it's
the half i'm not in
can we take a vote
i i feel it like this is something we
can agree on
although we all have completely
different opinions all over the board
can we agree
that the half that's wrong is the half
that we're not in
everybody can we agree on that right am
i right yeah it's the other people
if i were to
write an essay on
what is the one problem that's
with this country and maybe yay the
world
the big problem it's other people
it's other people
present company excluded obviously
you're pretty awesome
you're pretty awesome and i know i am
so it's really other people
other people
now i know they think the same thing
but the difference is they're wrong
that's how other people are
no wonder people don't like other people
if you think about how other people act
well it's just natural
um
janet yellen
uh
treasury secretary she admits that maybe
she was wrong about this whole inflation
thing
so i thought it was a little bit more
transitory
than it was
um
i just love the fact that her last name
is yellen
y-e-l-l-e-n
do you think that
caused her to have to modify her
behavior at all at any point in her life
i don't know if that's a her born name
or if that's a married name
but i'd i hate to be a woman
in a powerful position
and have a last name by yellen
[Laughter]
okay
i wasn't even thinking of old yellen
okay that's a funny that's a funny
reference
but i was just thinking you know
don't women always say
i don't have personal experience here
but correct me if i'm wrong but don't
women always say that you know they're
judged more harshly if they're
if they're tough in business
and here's janet yellen she's at the top
of her game and business treasury
secretary
uh
doing pretty well
and
and her last name is yellen
i wonder if she had to be
extra soft and she's still scared people
like you you've been called to
you've been called to the boss's office
the boss
yelling
well i don't know if she'll be yelling
no i mean that's her name yeah
i mean just she just sounds scary i
wouldn't want to go to a boss's office
if her name was yellen
anyway she says that
she was wrong about this inflation thing
how many of you think she was wrong and
how many of you think she was lying
and knew it i guess you'd have to know
it if you were lying how many things she
was lying in the comments
comments
oh you skeptics oh you disbelievers
why do you distrust
government officials so
oh oh i'm so disappointed in all of you
for being so distrustful
okay yes um i'm gonna say that
we can't read minds
right
can't read minds
i will allow
i will allow that's possible she's not
lying
because the other possibility is that
she's confessing that she's thoroughly
incompetent at her job
and i think we should at least give her
that
you know benefit of a doubt
if she's saying no i'm not lying i'm
just really really bad at my job and
should never be in this position
oh
maybe we should believe her
no i'm just kidding i'm kidding she lied
we guess
we don't know but kind of looks like it
doesn't
new york times had an article now the
important part about this
is that it's the new york times
so new york times is the paper of record
blah blah blah
so if they say it it's supposed to be
true so i'm not going to get into an
argument too much about what's true or
not
yeah i am a little bit okay
i'm lying
so new york times on an article that
says basically that
what we know now is that masks
do work but mandates don't
meaning that masks work
except that when you wear them
they don't do anything that you hoped
would happen when you wear them
but they work
but they work
now
i'm wondering if this is sort of the
difference between the the engineer and
the politician or something you know to
fuse the world
let me ask you a question to see where
your brain is at all right
if you took a screen off a screen door
and then you took a bucket of water
and you
port it through the screen
with the screen door you know an actual
screen from your
your door
uh would it
would it stop the water
let's say let's say that was your
intention was to
stop the water would it do it
what do you say
so some say no
some say stop some what do you mean some
the thing's full of holes
why only sub
some say it slows it down
right
well so
i guess it depends how much of an
engineer you are
and i mean that in the best possible
sense because i always have the highest
regard for the way engineers think
more so than scientists in in many ways
because it's more the practical the
practical way of thinking
and
here's how i think of it when i imagine
pouring water through a screen
if you can touch the screen right after
you poured the water
it was still wet
it did something
but if you could argue that it worked
or that you should put screens on your
roof instead of shingles that's sort of
a bad argument
so
things may technically slow things down
so i think when they did studies the
same masks work
it did create some friction but not
enough to make a difference and then the
article um
hypothesizes that's because people were
bad at
wearing their masks
here's what i think
nobody social socially distance at home
maybe that's the whole thing
maybe it doesn't doesn't matter what you
say about masks
if people go home and just take them off
and do whatever the hell they want to do
especially with their neighbors and
their friends because i think there was
such such massive
non-social distancing
that there's nothing you could have done
with masks that you would have noticed
in the in the data
so but at least the new york times has
uh
um said that you can't it's not obvious
in the data
now as andres bakayos points out
that's not the standard for knowing if
something worked
you can't just sort of look at two
places or even two things that you think
are similar in different periods of time
you're never really comparing
the right stuff so you can never really
be sure and there are too many variables
in here etc
but
if you're making a social policy that's
affecting a lot of people like in a
really fundamental way
and there's not enough of a positive
impact that you can even identify it
that's good enough reason not to do it
because freedom has to be the
the tiebreaker right if you can't tell
if it makes a difference
overall you have to go with freedom
i mean to me that seems like a
no-brainer but
anyway so i think you could say that
masks worked in some some minor way that
didn't matter to the pandemic
um
how about uh
how about this for timing
you know do you ever think that you live
in a simulation and it's designed just a
just to f with you personally
here was my
situation
for about three years now or whatever
it's been i've been trying to
surf this pandemic and play it right
right so early on
when it was a fog of war i went to went
into maximum caution
i never washed
i didn't i never washed my groceries or
so i was never worried about surfaces
too much well maybe on the first week or
so i was
but
you know the fog of war i i played it
that way i go okay good
even though
i you know over i exaggerated the risk
in my mind
i didn't get the virus and it was you
know just a few weeks no big deal
but then as we learned you know more and
more about it i thought okay my best bet
is to let other people get the
vaccination first
and wait as long as i can
without getting the virus before i get
the vaccination before i even decide
and then i decided i wanted it because i
wanted to travel basically
now
getting the vaccination in my case
never made any difference as far as i
can tell
in other words i believe i got a
vaccination that gave me a risk of a
vaccination however small
i don't know what size it is
but i can tell at this point
because i actually didn't contract it
and it's unlikely that the vaccination
would have stopped me from contracting
it there is that i got the
that i took the risk of the vaccination
but now i know
that it didn't benefit me doesn't mean
it was the wrong decision it just means
that when you buy insurance you don't
always catch on fire right
so
if you think of it as an insurance
policy it wasn't wrong it just now we
know how it turned out
yeah it was my choice it was my choice
that was key
as somebody says the key thing here is
it was my choice the whole time that i
decided to not get the
the second set of boosters so i got the
first two the pair
and i said to myself oh now this
omicron's coming along
now with the omicron
once i get that because i probably will
everybody will
then i've got the omicron immunity
the the delta and the alpha are behind
us i think
and
then i've got all my omicron immunity
it's better than having even a
vaccination because apparently the
vaccination doesn't do much for omicron
and like
just yesterday i said to myself
finally
finally it's been a long you know
long search through the swamp but i
reached the promised land
i survived omicron which was easy
right
now i've got natural immunity
to the thing that's the one
yesterday
the day that i achieved my goal
of the ultimate immunity
in the perfect timing
we also learned that there's no such
thing as natural immunity for omicron
if you haven't heard that yet
allow me to say
 you me and all of us
because that was the one thing that we
were hoping for
the one thing we hope for
is if you get this thing once
you're done
or maybe twice and done
but now it turns out yes if you haven't
heard this this is bloomberg i just
tweeted it yesterday so you can see it
in my twitter feed so this is brand new
apparently there are so many different
omicron variants
that getting one of them gives you no
protection from its cousin
and you're not likely to get the same
one you got again
i mean you might have some protection
from the one you got
but there's so many out there it's
basically
wasn't it
was it jimmy kimmel who got
omicron twice this month
he got it twice in three weeks
and apparently that's going to happen to
all of us
apparently you don't get much natural
immunity now for mummicron there's too
many of them
right now what are the odds
that in the very day
that i recovered from the virus and had
my you know my dream dove
ultimate you know i'm done with it never
have to think about it again immunity is
the day they find out it's not real
what were the odds of that really
i feel like the odds of that were low
yeah monkey pox up next monkey box
all right well that's the current thing
there uh the uh
there's a story
that i guess it came out you know when
when nobody's paying attention to the
news
that there's some
hacking vulnerabilities to electronic
voting machines
specifically the ones who were tested
it's not to say these are the only ones
but the ones that they tested first were
from a company called dominion
i don't know if you've heard that name
in reference to
voting machines but apparently
there were some
vulnerabilities
which could be exploited
now i'm quick to say that there's no
evidence
that
any dominion voting machines were in
fact
exploited
right so that's not the claim
nobody's claiming they were exploited
indeed
no court has found that any major fraud
happened in 2016. none
none of it was proven
and as you know
if you look in the wrong place for
something and you use the wrong
sensor to find it
and you don't find it it's not there
that's what we've been taught and that's
what i believe
and so
with the debating machines while there
is no evidence whatsoever that anything
uh untoward happened
there are concerns there are concerns
and uh
there are at least it seemed
some suggestion that these were bad
enough that a vote could have been
changed
but what we are not told
is whether there would be any way for a
vote to be changed that we wouldn't know
about
or
be able to easily know about
i guess
so
what i don't know is would it be
detectable
is there everything is every possible
thing you could do to one of these
vulnerabilities
are they all detectable
now i think the company said that their
current procedures would have caught
all of these problems
and that might be true
so i i actually also feel bad for the uh
the company so
let me
let me uh
give dominion a little bit of support
here
i don't feel like their side of the
argument god has shown in this article
at all
so i'm not so sure and this came from
was it ap or reuters or something
um
but i'd like to i'd like to hear their
side of the argument
you know what is the worst vulnerability
maybe they can't tell us because it
makes it even more dangerous
but i'd love to know what was the worst
vulnerability
and then if they say they have a
procedure that would have you know made
that vulnerability not such a big deal
anyway
what was that procedure
and
if somebody had gotten past it how would
you know
there's just some basic questions like
that but they might have good answers to
that
right
they might they might say
yeah you know i hear what you're saying
but there's no way that could have
happened and here's why
maybe who knows i always thought that
the big vulnerability in voting systems
is the human beings
isn't it
i feel like
an insider can do
sort of anything
maybe you need two insiders you know it
might might not be possible with one but
maybe you need two
so
you know i always thought that to
imagine that any system is unhackable is
pretty unrealistic
so now we know that the voting machines
uh are
hypothetically
less secure than one would want
well in the uh
surprising not surprising story of the
day that uh sussman
attorney guy
that that was being
charged in the durham case for lying to
the fbi for saying that he was not
working for hillary clinton i guess
when he brought the russia collusion
lies
to the fbi
and
the spin that i'm seeing from um and i
don't even know if this is spent so
that's unfair the
the narrative let's say
i've seen on fox news is that it was a
dc
uh jury
and they're all democrats and hillary
clinton supporters
and there was no way that suspended was
going to get convicted even though the
evidence was clearly
you know clearly shown that he lied
now
i don't know
i i'm having i'm having a little bit of
trouble with that because on one hand
i'm willing to believe that a dc jury
would always
pardon a democrat
or often enough
that it could explain what's going on
i mean that's within the plausible
range i think
uh doesn't mean it's true but it's
within the plausible range the other the
other possibility is
that i've never once seen this story
explained accurately
how about that
how about the reason that i'm surprised
is that i've never once seen the real
news
right
why would you rule that out if you were
surprised by the verdict
why is it one of the possibilities that
you personally have never seen the real
news
and that if you saw the real news you'd
say oh yeah
it's obvious he wasn't going to be
convicted of this
because what what the hell was the
defense
you know didn't they have a defense
the news i saw was that
it's obvious he lied
end of the story
that's all i saw i never saw i mean
everyone saw a defense
the defense was no i didn't
and i i thought the evidence was pretty
clear he did
that's what i thought but doesn't does
that mean i saw fake news
or that it was a fake jury
which is more likely
it was a fake jury meaning they just
didn't even follow the law
or that the news that i watched and
maybe some of you too
was so fake
that we don't realize that the jury had
a perfectly good reason to acquit him
what's more likely
ah i feel it's more likely that it was
fake news
um but it's probably a little both
meaning that whatever the defense did
never got to my ears but i'd like to
hear it so the defense probably put up a
reasonably good defense i have to think
and i think that one of the facts i
hadn't heard before
is that the cab ride over was billed not
to hillary clinton
the cab ride over to talk to the fbi and
like all right well what does it take to
get reasonable doubt
you know it could be just one of those
reasonable doubt things where it it
where the case
is based entirely upon what somebody was
thinking
is that it
because i think to be honest i think i
could have gotten him off
on that
if it had been me i think if i had been
the lawyer i think i could have gotten
him off i say you know it really just
sort of depends what you think he was
thinking
that's not a standard for convicting
somebody
some version of that maybe that's what
it is
all right so a lot of smart people are
saying that the
it was probably a jury problem and i do
not discount that
but also don't discount that there might
have been a defense that you just didn't
see
and maybe it's just corruption i would
say that's a good possibility but if you
thought that a democrat would get caught
red-handed and then uh
prosecuted it looks like that didn't
happen
[Applause]
maybe the car right-handed part
but
here's the amazing thing that during the
this is fox reporting too i think
um
during the course of the trial
robbie mook who was the clinton campaign
manager he actually testified the
hillary clinton
approved disseminating the unproven
and debunked information to the media
so we actually have a court testimony by
hillary clinton's campaign manager that
she literally was the kingpin
for the russia collusion
hoax
the most dangerous hoax ever
perpetrated on the american people
except for her other hoaxes i guess
and
and somehow
somehow we're okay with that
i guess we just go on oh well i guess we
know that
now so
cnn's the way they're handling it i
thought was fascinating
and
i've said this before but
cnn became really entertaining again
and it's because i learned to read it
differently
because now i read it for
um what the official narrative is trying
to be like to watch them try to turn the
narrative i'm not really looking at them
for news anymore it's more about like a
peek behind the curtain to find out what
the powers that be you want
but
uh so chris eliza
is trying to
trying to paint this as
not a gigantic travesty of justice the
thing about sussman not being convicted
and
he so he writes in cnn he goes for years
literally
donald trump has insisted that hillary
clinton engaged in a purposeful
conspiracy designed to keep him out of
the white house
right so he says this like he's now
going to debunk this
but that's the part that we was proven
to be true
that's what
didn't robbie buck testify that that was
true
that hillary clinton did engage in a
purposeful conspiracy designed to keep
him out of the white house
but the way seliza
sets it up
it makes you think that now he's going
to show you that that was proven not to
be true
and then he goes to probe into it
he goes on tuesday sussman was found not
guilty of the lying charge
so now that it says the verdict is a
major defeat for durham and is blah blah
blah
uh
and it remains to be seen when blah blah
blah
and i'm thinking did he just tie
together two things that weren't related
so he starts out by saying that trump
made these claims
and then he says
that this one specific set of charges
against sussman didn't hold up
but during the course of the trial
trump was proven correct right because
robbie mook confirmed exactly
and and didn't we learn that the lawyer
did work for the campaign it's just not
the lying to the fbi part that was the
problem
the apparently he got away with that
so
this is weird
like the the amount of gaslighting
here is is so head shaking and so
massive
that you don't know what to do with it
like your brain can't really process it
it's too big of a
it's too big of a gas light you just go
i
want to think about something else now
um
so apparently it's not a it's not any
kind of a crime for hillary clinton to
have created a hoax
about russia collusion with a political
candidate that could have changed the
course of what probably did change the
course of
history
let me ask you this
if the united states had not been primed
by several years of hillary clinton
lying about russia colluding with
trump
would we have been backing ukraine as
vigorously now like it feels like the
united states
had been primed for an anti-russia
situation
and then an anti-russia situation hey
guess what it came up
so it feels like we you know hillary
has been
involved in a long game against putin
and putin's been in a long game against
hillary and we're just sort of the
the innocent bystanders like we're just
drive-by victims as they're strafing
each other every few years
but
suppose
that
suppose it was a crime
for somebody like hillary clinton to
come up with a completely fake
hoax and try to sell it to the fbi
and it'd be one thing to just say it on
tv
you expect your politicians to lie but
to actually get law enforcement involved
to take down a president
what should be the penalty for that if
that were a crime it's not apparently
apparently that's completely legal
but what should be the penalty if it
were a crime
well i did a little uh twitter poll 20
said death
21 said life in prison
uh 10 years in prison it was the most
popular one 56
so basically we've got
the
the woman who would have run
or would have been the president if not
for trump
and
56 think she should have gone to prison
for 10 years for the way she handled the
election at least people answered my
poll not exactly a scientific poll
so i guess
the biden administration is now
clarifying that they do not wish to
remove putin from power
indeed
rather than thwart putin's ambitions and
remove him for power
the new plan is to give him a large part
of ukraine you know the valuable parts
so
not exactly a success
and
biden said we do not seek a war between
nato and russia biden wrote
as much as i disagree with mr putin and
find his actions in our age the united
states will not try to bring about his
ouster in moscow
do you know what feels like happened
now i'm going to go full conspiracy
theory here
but sort of eisenhower style meaning
not really
does it feel as if the
military-industrial complex
just needed something to replace
middle eastern wars
in afghanistan
and they had and they knew that we had
all of this old equipment that needed to
be used up before
anybody buys new stuff
and that
the entire ukraine war was orchestrated
by the industrial military complex
and it was it was about nothing but
moving inventory
and that the reason that biden has now
pivoted to well maybe we can work with
this putin guy
is because
the
military-industrial complex literally
can't make any weapons faster than they
already are
meaning
they don't need any extra war now
we have just the right amount of
conflict
because all of the weapons
makers
are cranking out weapons as fast as they
can to replace the stockpiles of stuff
that went to ukraine
is it a coincidence
that the real world happens to
correspond exactly to what one could
imagine would be the best interest of a
specific industry
how is that a coincidence
so if you wanted to follow the money
i would say
look at whether our
you know our weapons makers are
operating at capacity
if they're making you know drones and
missiles and replacement tanks and
everything else and
handheld missiles
uh what do you call the shoulder mounted
stuff if we're making that as fast as we
can
so that there would be no benefit of
having any extra conflict
you should expect they will negotiate
some kind of a deal
that's where the money says we're going
so
um let me summarize this
there are two things we uh
we learned this month
uh one is that everything you suspected
was true
everything you suspected was true
hillary clinton was
was behind the russia collusion hoax
voting machines
are
vulnerable as you suspected
transitory inflation was always a lie it
was always a lie
mass mandates don't work
and uh biden family are crooks
all the things you thought were true
have actually be been shown to be true
so that's number one that's the first
thing you've learned everything you
suspected was
true weird
and number two
no one will be held responsible
everything you suspected was true
no one will be held responsible
none of these stories have anybody
getting going to jail or
right
who who's who's gonna lose a job or
anything
who lost an election lost a job
went to jail paid a ticket
anything
every one of those things that you
thought maybe were true were true
now
that doesn't mean that the 2016 election
was rigged that's that's a different
topic i'm not saying that
i'm saying that anything that can be
rigged will be rigged
you just don't know if it's happened yet
so
we do know that if these vulnerabilities
were the kind that could actually change
elections we're not i'm not sure that's
true
but if that's true that they were that
kind of vulnerabilities
and they had persisted
somebody would have rigged an election
eventually probably
you just have to wait for it
we just don't know if it happened
already
and can we get a johnny depp verdict
today please
can we
uh you keep saying uh
2016.
oh i'm sorry
2020 yes
2020 election we don't know about the
2020 election
yeah we need a johnny depp verdict to
entertain us
well ladies and gentlemen
that concludes the live stream
and
i think you would probably agree
that the long coven made this a better
show than normal
right
a little bit better
and
you should start looking out for the
little superpowers you're gonna get to
maybe you'll get a little better better
rest
concentrate better
might have a little bit more energy for
exercising i'll bet you'll even die at
better
let that long coven work for you
all right
let's
get those good mutations working for you
and
and
and
that's enough for today
