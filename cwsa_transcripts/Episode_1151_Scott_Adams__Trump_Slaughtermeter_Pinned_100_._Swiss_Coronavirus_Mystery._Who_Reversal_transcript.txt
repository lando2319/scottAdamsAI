okay everybody
come on in it's time it's time for
coffee with scott adams best part of the
day
every single time and what do you need
to enjoy
coffee with scott adams well as the name
implies
coffee or a beverage of your choice but
you've got to put it in something
you don't want to drink it with your
hands that's bad form
instead you need a cup or a mug or a
glass of tank or chalice or stein a
canteen flask a vessel of any
kind
see them on my back shelf there that's
your visual cue
and join me now for the dopamine hit of
the day the
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's gonna happen right now
go
i dare say that was septastic
yeah it was oh we got a lot of fun stuff
to talk about today
i'd like to start by telling you about
my dream
oh no don't turn it off yet i know
there's nothing more boring than hearing
about somebody's dream
but watch how cleverly i fold this into
my story
hold on when i was a kid i had a
recurring dream
in which i could fly i could actually
just float and levitate and fly
and uh i would have this dream maybe
once a year
it was my favorite dream but there was
one
catch even though the dream itself was
spectacular because
as i said i could fly
imagine a vivid dream where you can just
float around the house and
you could be up at the ceiling and you
could go outside and you could float
over the town
it was great there was only
one problem with it and it was this
for whatever reason my dream always
included the following element
other people were not impressed
it was always in the dream i'd be
floating literally at the ceiling and
i'd say to the people below me
say hey do you see this i'm literally
flying
and people would look up and then they
just continue their conversations
and i say no i don't think you
understand i
am above the ground defying gravity
literally the first human being who has
ever flown
and i'm doing it right in front of you
and nobody cared
and they would just go about their
business and i would keep saying are you
serious
i'm flying i'm flying
look at me why can't you see me
every year once a year and so i was
reminded of that dream
when i was reading a piece by andrew
mccarthy
in which he says this that this is just
one part of what he said that is that
clinton clinton meaning hillary actually
did what she accused
trump of doing she colluded with
russians
through through yet another foreigner
she recruited to meddle in the 2016
presidential campaign
the ludicrous former british by
christopher steele
in order to damage trump's campaign and
since the election for herself
now i believe that that is so well
documented
by the handwritten notes etc coming out
of the uh
and the disclosures that this is just a
fact
right and i feel like andrew mccarthy is
having my flying dream right now
he he's he's saying okay people
it's the biggest story of all time the
whole russia collusion thing
was literally opposite it was actually
an example
of hillary clinton colluding with
russians
to overthrow the legally elected
government of the united states
so how about that and all the people
on earth say yeah checking my stocks
how's the weather today and then andrew
mccarthy says
um okay i i don't think you heard me
because your reaction is not really
matching what i just said so let me let
me say it again more clearly
we have now proof no doubt about it
proof that hillary clinton colluded with
russians to overthrow the legally
elected government of the united states
anything does anybody care
seriously you're just going to ignore
this
i don't know what to say about it it is
so
mind-bogglingly it's exactly like my
flying dream
why can't people pay attention to this
why does this seem like it's happening
and not happening at the same time
why is it the biggest story of all time
that's not being reported on
at least the mainstream media it's
mind-boggling
anyway moving on um
i've told you about something i call the
adam's law of slow-moving disasters
and it goes like this when the humanity
can see a huge
problem coming from a long ways away
we have a 100 track record of handling
it
for example we could see far in advance
that it would be hard to feed all the
people if the population kept growing
but we figured out how to make more food
and yeah we
we did a pretty good job of it we
thought we would run out of oil
but we figured out how to frack and how
to find more oil
and build solar panels etc so looks like
we'll get through it
likewise with climate change looks like
it's the end of the world if the
scientists
the consensus of them are right but
i'm pretty confident that we'll figure
out workarounds
and we'll be fine but as the
time that you have to fix a problem gets
compressed
the shorter and shorter you have well
then it gets a little more uncertain
the more time you have the more likely
you'll figure it out
but what about voting
this year the question is whether the
voting mechanisms will be secure
will it be will the mail-in voting
give us a credible result or a
non-credible result will there be so
many
problems and we can't fix it well we're
seeing already
a whole bunch of misprinted ballots that
we're scrambling to
to fix you see states moving their
deadlines for
when you could have a postmark on your
mailing ballot
so you're seeing people scrambling to
adjust and they
you could argue that they might have
started a few months ago
and they've got a few more weeks and
they're working
they're probably working you know around
the clock trying to fix problems and
monitor for problems and everything
it's going to be close it's going to be
close
on one hand i always bet on humans
if there's enough time on the other hand
if there's not enough time
i bet against humans every time
because humans are not good at doing
complicated things
correctly the first try it's almost not
a thing
in fact when it happens it becomes the
stuff of legends
for example the first time we actually
launched a rocket
with the attempt of putting somebody on
the moon
it worked that's one of the reasons it's
such a big deal because it was a really
big chance
but it worked so that's the one we talk
about more than anything else
so if i had to guess
let me put this positive filter on it i
think the voting
will be better than it should have been
in other words i think that humanity is
really going to try to
rise to this challenge because the
stakes are so high
and we do have some time it's not like a
hurricane
you know where you have maybe a few days
we had weeks
there should have been enough time to
print things reprint things check things
scrub databases as much as possible so
we might be in a little better shape
than we thought so that's my positivity
on there
so yesterday i shared with you my
conspiracy theory that you shouldn't
take too seriously
the kim jong-un shows up on video
not talking and then separately you hear
the audio of him talking
but you don't see him talking on video
which at least opens up the possibility
that you're looking at a body double on
video and somebody who can do a good
impression
on audio so cnn read another piece
on kim jong-un's big celebration thing
in which he showed up in public
and it teased that it was going to show
kim jong-un
being emotional during his speech so i
said to myself
ah i guess that conspiracy theory fell
apart
because cnn is going to show me a clip
of kim jong-un giving a speech
it does look like it's something current
and
he'll be emotional while he's talking
and then i will see
him physically the video and i'll hear
him talking at the same time
and then there's no doubt about it right
if you see
the emotion and you see him talking he's
he's alive he's well
and then they show the clip and they
show kim jong-un in front of the
microphone and he's
he's got some tears he's emotional
and then i'm waiting for him to talk and
they cut away
they don't show him talking i don't know
if that video exists
probably exists because i don't believe
my own conspiracy theory
but it's getting increasingly
interesting
that the thing you'd most expect a video
of him
talking currently the only thing that i
would find completely credible
doesn't yet exist so that's why it's a
conspiracy theory
don't take it too seriously um
andres uh back house who keeps me honest
on all things
data uh when you when you're on twitter
all day
um when you depend on uh
when you're on twitter all day you see a
lot of bad data and andres
often comes into the comments and clears
up my misconceptions
so uh he did that a couple of times
today one of the times
was he pointed out there's a paper that
estimates the trade war costs for china
were far greater than for the united
states so they do the math
they figured out that china probably
cost them 35 billion
which would be about 0.3 of their gdp
whereas the us probably cost us a little
under
16 billion half as much but we also have
a bigger economy
so it was only 0.08
of our gdp and apparently vietnam was a
big beneficiary their gdp went up
so um it's starting to look
like trump's instinct on the trade war
was correct in the sense that it would
cost to china more than it would cost
us so if somebody was going to blink
it would probably be them uh you know
all things
being equal now of course they would put
pressure on our farmers
so it's not exactly apples to apples you
know because they could put a little
political pressure on us in a way that
we can't put political pressure on them
because of the differences in the
systems but it still suggests
that trump's instincts were in the right
direction
that china would have more to lose and
if you go into
a debate or let's say into a trade war
with somebody who definitely has more to
lose than you do
it's a strong position doesn't mean
you'll command a head
doesn't mean you win doesn't mean it
comes out good in the end
but it certainly makes it look smart
makes it look like a good play
um all right so let's get to the meat of
this
i have placed the trump slaughter meter
at a hundred percent
it has been as low as 50 percent even
last week
when trump was was still sick with
coronavirus
and was doing some things that were
getting a lot of
negative attention uh like driving
around
you know and putting a risk his
drivers the critics say and he did put
them at risk
i just think it was such a small risk it
wasn't terribly important
but it's at 100
now i remind you for those who are not
familiar with the
slaughter meter the slaughter meter is
not
a prediction all right it's not
the slaughter meter just tells you how
the day is going
or how the week is going it's a snapshot
in time
this says artificially and remember this
is very artificial
that if everything kept going the way
things went this week
you would expect you know this outcome
so if everything went the way things are
going
today trump would win easily
and let me give you an idea of what's
happening today
because the new cycle is just crazy
isn't it
how quickly you can be whiplash from
from oh he's definitely going to lose
too well he's definitely going to win
oh he's definitely going to lose it's
like whiplash so the the slaughter meter
could change again
you know 20 times before election but as
of today
it's pinned at 100 and here's why number
one
uh well let me give you some context
trump
doesn't need to convince you that he did
a great job
in all elements of the coronavirus
he doesn't need to make that case now
you think he would
because that's the biggest complaint
against him
it's the one that seems to stick so all
of the experts
seem to agree democrats and republicans
that where trump is most
vulnerable to criticism is the
coronavirus
because the u.s numbers don't look good
compared to other countries
so that's gigantic gigantic weakness
because it's the thing in our minds
it's the thing that most scares us it
affects the economy it affects
everything
he's got to get the coronavirus right or
rlc can't get reelected right
wouldn't you say that would just be
obvious he's got to get it right
it's the most important thing or
does he this is what i would like to add
to the
thinking on this not true he does not
need to convince you that the most
important thing
happening right now he got right
there's another way to do it he has to
convince you
that it isn't that scary because if
you're convinced
that the coronavirus went from a 10 and
a 10 in scariness
let's say in march and he's reduced it
to uh
five maybe if trump can get your fear
level from a ten
and a ten down to a five it's not going
to matter that much
how it was handled because its
importance will be
less in your mind so here's what
happened this week
that will have the the irrational effect
of making you less scared number one
trump is 73 or 4 got the coronavirus
he's got a comorbidity
went into the hospital and as of today
just what a week later or whatever
he looks great he looks great now
should anybody take from one anecdote
about one
person who had the best medical care in
the world and was discovered early
with the testing and had a good outcome
should you
extend that one single person and of
seven billion
would be be logical or rational to say
oh well
i guess it's safe because it will happen
with that one person that one time
no that would be completely irrational
and you're going to do it anyway
you can't help it we are story driven
creatures
you can give me all the data in the
world big mountain of data over here
and then one story about trump gets the
coronavirus and he's
he's 100 a week later those are not
equal
that one story about trump recovering
is bigger than your whole mountain of
data
because it's visual we see it we feel it
we talk about it it comes it becomes
number one in our heads
it just gives us it just takes us in an
irrational place
which helps trump so that's number one
trump fully recovered
becomes its own little story with power
and he knows that by the way
he's playing it because he knows how
powerful that is
here's the other thing that's coming
it's not quite here yet
but i would say it's right on the border
of being here
and it's this there were 34 people who
were allegedly
infected who had some white house
connection
34 people that's terrible right
that's really bad for trump right
because
it would show that he mismanaged the
protection element of it
and got 34 people infected so that's
day one story but what's the story next
week
chris christie is already out of the
hospital looks like he'll be fine
weren't you worried about him i mean
honestly
if you're being honest you know you
heard that chris christie got
coronavirus and you said to yourself oh
that's not good
because comorbidity city right he's got
i think two
co-morbidities he's got asthma he's got
a weight issue
he's not as young as he could be i don't
know how old he is but he's not
quite into the danger zone but he's not
a spring chicken
so he's out of the hospital looks like
he'll be fine
what happens what happens if
and i think this is the most likely
scenario what happens if
all 34 people are fine
in a week doesn't look as dangerous does
it
now would that tell you anything could
you look at 34 people
who again were tested early founder
found their symptoms early got the best
treatment in the world
probably can you make any you know
logical inference
from 34 people no you can't they're all
special cases
but that's not how your brain works your
brain is going to say
okay now i see this pattern feels like
everybody who gets it including chris
christie
including president trump with his
comorbidities
it feels like everybody's getting better
maybe this trump cure
this regeneron and maybe with the
rendezvous depending on where you are in
the infection
arc huh it's sounding a little bit more
like a cure isn't it
now is that logical nope nope
there's no logic to what i just said
because the
the uh the death rate of the virus
is known to be less than one percent
and if you took 34 people with great
health care who got
you know detected early there's a really
really high chance
they'll all be fine and it wouldn't mean
anything
beyond what you already knew it would
just be more of the same
but because we're going to look at it
because we're focused on it
because there'll be famous people
senators uh
you know the the white house spocks
all of these people are people you know
they're familiar faces
the weight of those 34 people getting
better and
let's hope they do right you know
nobody's out of the woods completely yet
but it's going to start looking like
that really soon
starting to look like they're all out of
the woods because if any of them had
turned
bad if anybody else had been
hospitalized
well you'd know it by now you'd know it
by now
but there's i'm saving the best one for
last
all right so before i get to the best
one last the economy is improving
right so your economy is getting better
and we have these anecdotal stories of
people who seem to go through the
coronavirus fine
and there's a story for why it's better
now
than it used to be and president trump
has provided the story
the story is that these new therapeutics
are the bomb
they're just really good so you've got a
reason
and you've got a story way more powerful
than data
way more powerful not even in the same
universe data very very unimportant
if you haven't noticed you should be the
most important
but it's not story
very important and the story is all
trump right now
you didn't see that coming did you so
the economy is improving
which you would expect because it's
coming off a low base
right it shouldn't be any big surprise
that an economy coming off a low point
would have big percentage gains
so i i think somebody said that on
october october 29th
just a few days before election we're
going to see gdp
results that show that the gdp had a
record increase
in other words a world record for the
united states increased
quarter over a quarter i think i think
it's going to look like that they might
not but it will be a good increase
either way
now why should you make from that oh my
god trump is a genius
because we made a record for recovery
no no it would not be logical
in any way to attribute that to
leadership
per se because we're coming off a low
base
and anybody who had been president would
have experienced
probably a record gain because what's
weird about this
this disaster it's not like a war where
you have to rebuild a factory before you
can get your gdp up
you just have to turn on the lights and
say all right back to work
turn on the lights everybody who used to
be working here you're all
you're all trained just come back and do
what you were doing last
last you know spring so
the economy will of course look good it
won't mean what people think it means
but they will process it
as though it's a trump success
right so irrationally it all works in
his favor
still saves the best part for last are
you ready
this will make this whole periscope
worthwhile
so as of today the world health
organization
who announced that it does not favor
lockdowns
as a as a way of combating coronavirus
did you know that yet yeah the world
health organization
experts if you will indeed probably
the experts in this very thing
have come out publicly said they do not
favor
lockdowns of the economy and the reason
given
reason given it's bad for poor people
bad for black people bad for brown
people
bad for anybody who's in the bad
economic situation
and here's what's fun about this
you might say to yourself well scott but
the world health organization has some
credibility problems that's why we
pulled out
they were you know first said masks are
bad then they said they're good
they said that the not to worry too much
about the virus but then it turns out
we should worry so it does seem as
though the world health
organization is not that credible but
wait
it gets better it gets better
let's say you're a democrat
and you hear this news the world health
organization says that
well they don't use these words but they
say
in effect that trump was right
when he contradicted the experts and
said let's open up the economy
that's right one of the biggest expert
groups and according to democrats
very credible the world health
organization
has just sided with trump who had
opposed
most of the experts or a lot of the
experts on
the there were there was a very growing
sizable minority of experts
who were saying the same thing the world
health organization said
which is ah you might be hurting people
more than helping with
these lockdowns so if you're a democrat
and your big thing about trump is that
he doesn't follow the science
what do you do now what do you do now
those of us who like president trump
one of the things you like about him the
best is that he doesn't follow the
science
because the science is often
right you knew that you knew that
you knew that the science is often not
always and certainly we should
pay attention to science certainly we
should give it
the the greatest of weight but it's
often
that's just a fact and you need a leader
who is willing
to say um okay i hear what you're saying
but i still think it's and
here's why
that's what trump did from the very
beginning
when everybody else was saying ah hey
idiot orange man
lock down it's the only way we can
defeat this thing
you gotta lock down why are you being
such a
why don't you listen to the experts why
don't you listen to
science uh-oh
science just agreed with them maybe not
all of science
but the world health organization not
exactly president trump's friend right
is there anybody who dislikes president
trump more than the world health
organization
probably not this month they might
they might be the winners
so somebody says i'm i'm glad you're
finally in
about the experts i don't think you know
my
history if you're saying that comment i
have never been the one who backed the
experts
uncritically i i would be closer to the
opposite
i'm very much closer to the person who
said
there's a reason the experts are wrong
here are all the reasons
i'm the dilbert guy you don't write the
dilbert cartoon and believe experts are
right
you're just automatically i think that
they i think
experts are moving fast in the direction
of being right
that's what science does science starts
out not knowing the answer
takes a lot of guesses that sometimes
don't work out
but it's moving toward truth it's
eliminating things that
they used to think are true and you know
narrowing it down getting toward truth
the problem with the experts in science
in general is that
you can't tell where you are on the path
you don't know if you're 25
of the way to truth 50 or 100
because it looks the same you just don't
know when you're done
because you think you think you're done
and then oh there's a new
new discovery i'm not done so if you add
these things together trump recovering
himself
anecdotal but is still is powerful 34
people
recovering probably we hope good you
know fingers crossed
again just anecdotal doesn't mean
anything
scientifically but it will matter it'll
matter to how afraid you are
and then the world health organization
completely eviscerating the argument
that trump doesn't follow science it's
the biggest argument coming out of the
biden campaign that's not the crazy
racism one
and it just got eviscerated because now
the
democrats have two choices they can
either
oppose science by opposing the world
health organization
do you see where how awesome this is the
democrats will have to
oppose experts and oppose science
to maintain their current view that
trump is wrong
they can't have it both ways anymore
they can't say trump is wrong and
science is good
and and accurate and you should follow
it it's gone
it's their biggest argument it just
evaporated
now does that mean that the world health
organization is right
i don't know how the hell would i know
right i i have a preference you know if
you make me the leader i'll i'll give
you a choice
i'll give you a confidence sounding
choice of what i think we should do
but i don't know you know that's part of
being a leader you just got to take your
best shot sometimes
so uh this is one of the strongest days
that the president has had by far i
don't know if the rest of the media will
recognize this
because it's the sort of thing that's
just happening in people's impressions
so going back to my original point the
president does not need to convince you
that he got everything right in managing
the coronavirus
he needs to make you less afraid of it
so it just goes down in your priorities
the world health organization just did
that for him
they just completed it he couldn't have
gotten there
i don't think he couldn't have gotten
there without their help
because people were still going to say
how about the experts
but what about the experts uh yeah i
hear what you're saying
but what about the experts not anymore
now the experts are clearly on different
sides and what do you do when the
experts
disagree what is the right thing for a
leader to do
when experts disagree
the leader makes a choice and the leader
if it's a good leader
will make a choice based on the most
basic concepts in other words he won't
make the
we won't make a choice or she the leader
will not make a choice based on
um the science as in well
i back this scientist and i believe this
data and i don't believe that data that
would be bad
leadership because if the scientists
can't agree
it would be absurd for the leader to say
ah i'm going to look into the science
myself
and now i've read all the science and i
picked this one
bad leadership a good leader says
we can't know that's what we know
what we know is we don't know so what do
you do
if you don't know how do you manage your
risk
if you don't know and i think that the
president
has found exactly the right sweet spot
here
he's the the thing that you can default
to
is freedom because the one thing we know
is that if we were to lose our freedom
to anything
screw it we're out of here right
we'd all just close the planet and
starve to death
if we lose our freedom we don't even
want to be here
if you say to me i can give you your
freedom back but there's a one percent
chance
that you'll die i'm in i'll take my
freedom
i'll give you your freedom back but
there's a one percent chance
your grandmother might die a few years
early
i'm in sorry grandma i'm going to talk
to grandma first
but you know what she agrees grandma
doesn't disagree
grandma wants me to be free grandma
wants to be free
will she take the higher risk that
she'll die
yes she will if she doesn't i'll do
everything i can to keep grandma safe
but if you don't know what's the right
thing to do
you have to default to the primary
primary human
needs and we have a primary human need
for
freedom and that affects of course the
economy
which keeps poor people alive which
keeps us happy which keeps us from
killing
ourselves all of these benefits
so trump has done what trump
always does he he peered through
this this impenetrable
you know data science crap
that wasn't quite as solid as it ever
needed to be we wanted it to be good but
it never was
he peered through it all and he found
the essential
human part and the human part
is this
day one coronavirus scares us
day two the coronavirus attacks us
attacks the united states day three
coronavirus seems to be winning even
though our president said it wouldn't
day four coronavirus is kicking our
 asses day five day six
week two week three week four
coronavirus is
ripping our civilization apart
month three coronavirus has us by the
neck
week five or month five
coronavirus is just kicking
our asses
month six you
coronavirus we're done we got us some
tools
they're not complete tools they're not
they're not enough to completely destroy
the coronavirus yet
but we're going on offense we're not
going to lose
anymore we're not going to lose to the
virus
we're not going to lose to china we're
not going to lose
any more and your president has made it
clear
that the losing part is behind us will
people die
yes yes they will will americans die
in large numbers that should and will
alarm us
yes are we going to back down
because it's risky nope
are we going to go forward yes
are we going to beat the coronavirus one
way or another
one way or another because we're done
we are just done losing
can't lose forever we're not losing
and the president has called the term
and the world health organization gave
him an assist
and i think i think it could be over
over in terms of the election so biden
coughed twice in public
yesterday and he coughed the other day
while he was giving a talk
now in all likelihood the coughing is
nothing he might be on a medication
for example there's one um blood
pressure medication that gives you a dry
cough
maybe he's on that who knows you know at
that age everybody is
so probably his coughing is not
coronavirus
but it is 20 20. and in 2020
um in 2020 nothing
nothing is off the table as uh schumer
has said everything's on the table
so will 2020 deliver the most
2020 thing that could ever happen
which is biden getting the coronavirus
now keep in mind
that if biden gets the coronavirus and
either one of these two things happens
either he recovers fine which would be
the best news
which would also make the virus look
less scary
again not in a data way but it would
just make us feel that way
um or he has a bad outcome and then of
course
um trump has a better victory but we
don't want that
outcome that would be the worst of all
cases but
he's coughing and if you see
the guy that you want to you know elect
president
one of them has recovered completely the
other one's older and you're not so
sure that biden could could recover
and he's coughing there's no way that
doesn't affect you
now i've said i've said that president
trump should
ask to debate kamala harris and i think
that would be a good play even though
she'd say no
it would it would tell you to think past
by them which i think would be good for
the for trump
all right um here is a really
interesting fact
set of facts coming out of switzerland
you know i've been telling you that
there's something deeply unexplained
about the coronavirus numbers in terms
of why is the united states have such
big numbers compared to other places
it doesn't seem to be completely
explained
by leadership it doesn't seem to be
completely explained by
you know we have higher obesity we have
a higher
black population and they get hit harder
if you put all of that in the mix it
doesn't seem to
explain the extraordinary difference
but then i heard this about switzerland
this came from
yasha malk
on twitter and if you look at
switzerland what's interesting about it
is that it has
three sections as a german speaking
section
french speaking and belgian i guess
flemish speaking
so you've got three distinct cultures in
switzerland
and here's what's interesting the three
cultures
had tremendously different experiences
in the same country and it's not even a
big country
geography wise switzerland is not not
terribly large
and in that little country switzerland
the germans did great germans had a
pretty good outcome
it was comparable to germany itself
the french didn't do so well they did
bad just like france now how do you
explain
that the french people in switzerland
had the same results as the french
people in france
and the german people in switzerland had
the same experience
as the german people in germany but in
switzerland itself in the same country
with the same with the same leadership
wildly different results
and same with the belgian group so they
they matched
each of those three uh ethnicities
matched very well to what the country
that they are associated with
different country how they did how do
you
explain that well one hypothesis
is that it's a cultural difference it
could be that germans don't touch as
much
it could be that they don't have the
same
closeness handshaking just cheek
kissing i don't know maybe something
like that
um so that's one one possibility and
that was what was suggested by
yasha's tweet but of course andre's back
house
came into the comments and and ruined
all my happiness because i thought i
last i understand what's going on
there's a very big difference in terms
of
cultural behavior that might be
important
and andres points out that there's also
another big variable
that cannot be overlooked which is
commuting
so in other words the french speaking
part probably
commutes to other french places the
german-speaking part
probably commute to work to other
german-speaking places
i assume some of this is over the border
and that
it really might have to do with where
the infection gets a hold
first and then where do they travel in
other words
do the french-speaking people in
switzerland
spend as much time traveling to the
german and belgian parts of switzerland
or do they stick within their own
french-speaking part probably
a lot of sticking within your own
neighborhood so
it could be that travel and
transportation
patterns end up explaining the whole
thing
that if you have a certain kind of
transportation pattern
you are relatively safe let's say new
zealand
what is the international travel pattern
or even the domestic travel pattern
within new zealand and if you saw that
visually
compared to say the united states would
they look similar
just you know one is bigger is that the
only difference
i don't think so i think our travel
patterns in the united states
might have a lot to do with our
experience if not the culture
all right um so that's still an open
question
but the fact that switzerland had such
different experiences
with one leadership does that not tell
you
that leadership is not the overarching
um variable because switzerland
should have had a fairly uniform
experience if the only thing that
matters
is how well you manage the manage the
outbreak
but in fact they were so different that
you could almost rule out
leadership as even being a variable
because if if it were you'd get more
similar results
and when you got something that was you
know an outsized
effect like an outbreak it would be like
new york city where you could look at
and say
well it's new york city we had more
travel
there was a problem with the the old
folks
who were put in nursing homes etc so you
would identify it
if it wasn't you know if it was an
exception you could track it down pretty
easily
all right more and more people talking
about the similarities between the
polling this year
and the polling in 2016. and if you look
at the swing states especially and you
look at the differences
you can see that the amount that hillary
was leading trump in 2016
only to lose those same states
is very similar in fact and in fact
biden
you know doesn't even lead as much as
hillary was
so are we going to run into the same
situation
because it looks exactly like 2016
well a lot of people are saying yes this
looks exactly like 2016
so we're going to get the same result
but here's the counter argument
the counter argument from uh nate
nae silver who i hold now as one of the
best follows on uh twitter
so if you're not following him you
really shouldn't
he's tremendous at sticking to the
numbers now does that mean he's always
right
of course not it doesn't work like that
he's not
he's not the kind of job where being
right all the time is even a thing
but he's really right a lot so even
though he
you know slightly got the 2016 race
wrong it was only slightly you know he
was pretty close
so i would consider him a very credible
source and he says that the 2016
experience won't tell us about
2020 because the pollsters
figured out what they did wrong in 2016
and they've made adjustments
so you can't compare them because one is
before they knew they had a problem
and one is after they corrected the
problem so now 2020 is
good right accurate now okay
that's a smart argument but there's a
counter to the counter
which i'll offer now some people say
that there were a few if any
shy trump supporters in 2016
after all there's some difference of
opinion on that
but there is i think there's some uh
unity
on the fact that it wasn't gigantic you
know it may it might have been small
might have made the difference but it
wasn't gigantic the the hidden shy trump
supporters who don't show up in polls
but 2020 is not 2016.
we have four years of being vilified for
being trump supporters
if you if you tell me that there aren't
more people hiding
their trump support in 2020 even from
pollsters
if you tell me that's not a thing i
you've lost all credibility because let
me tell you
i don't have data you know i don't have
a
way to show you data to prove it but a
hundred percent of experience
and observation is compatible with the
fact that they're hiding
you know not least at all i asked in a
twitter poll
which is unscientific of course but i
still got hundreds of people within
a minute who said that they've lied to
pollsters this year
this year they've lied to pollsters so
if if hundreds of people who follow me
on twitter
can in in a minute will confess that
they did that
i think there's a lot of that out there
there's a lot of that out there
all right um i'm starting to think that
the
oh and then if you look at some of the
other indicators like
there's one indicator that says that if
the uh
the candidate who gets over 75 percent
in the primaries always gets reelected
so there are a bunch of other little
weirdo kinds of
uh trends and correlations that
favor the president so all of the ones
that can't be rigged favor trump
all of the ones that can be rigged and
we're pretty sure they were
in 2016. all of those seem to be against
trump so if it's something that can be
rigged
it's against trump if it can't be rigged
such as looking at how much anybody got
in the primaries in the past
if it can't be rigged it favors trump
coincidence a coincidence that the only
things that don't favor him
are the things that are easily rigged
and were in 2016.
as far as i can tell all right here's a
an annoying provocative thought
i feel as though the election could come
down to
you know it'll always be close it could
come down to how successfully the
harris biden campaign that's what i'm
going to call them for now
from now on the harris biden campaign
and their corporate lackeys
it might come down to how how well they
can keep black voters
uninformed isn't that awful
that the election of this in this
country
will almost certainly come down to how
well
democrats can bamboozle and dupe
black voters into thinking you know
trump is something he's not
and the key to that the most important
thing
is the fine people hoax
the reason that i keep hammering on that
one hoax when you know
politics is full of things that are not
true but i keep hammering on that one
thing relentlessly
is because that's the key i tend i tend
to think of the world
uh in a physical analogy quite often
when i used to do computer programming
years ago
i would i would imagine my program as a
pinball machine
where the you know the control of the
program was the ball
and i was putting bumpers and levers and
things to control
you know where the ball ends up so i
would translate my
my programs into physical things so i
could manipulate them physically
when i was not sitting in front of my
computer
so i could do my programming in physical
ways like okay i need to build a
structure down here
there's going to be a you know building
over here that does this
and i tend to do the same thing with
politics
i translate it into these physical
models so i can manipulate them in my
head
and one of the physical models is that
black voters are literally in a
misinformation
jail all right
i suppose is that a racist visualization
probably is so uh just assume that i
don't mean it that way
um but i imagine that because they are
uninformed
and they're they're new sources and
specifically in this this one
area not in general but in this one area
they're underinformed
which is they believe the fine people
hoax
was real because their new source tells
it
is real and they don't see anything else
so if you believed that the president
really called
neo-nazis and white supremacist fine
people
and that he said it in public and that
he said it
with no remorse if you believe that was
true
you would believe everything else bad
said about him and race
because if that thing's true anything
could be true
so the find people hoax is not like the
other things
it's the key to the jail and if
black people ever get that key in other
words if
if the black voters learn how badly
they've been
duped intentionally completely
intentionally
how badly they've been conned on that
one
hoax that makes all the other hoaxes
look real
if they ever get that key they're just
going to shove it in the lock
and they're never going to vote democrat
again now what are the odds that that'll
happen
low i think the odds the odds of the
black population
getting their hands on that key and
finding out how badly they've been duped
by democrats
is low because they have control of the
new sources
but it could happen it's not impossible
it's just unlikely
um here's the best
funniest thing that i've heard in a
while let's say all day
uh there's a sports commentator maybe
you've seen him appears on fox news
every every now and then jason whitlock
he's uh he's black which is important to
this story
and i say this every time can we
ever get to the place where you can tell
a freaking story
without mentioning the race or the
gender of the person involved
can we get to that point like oh i
just crave the time when i don't have to
add that
and he's black because it does matter to
the story
and what he said was that
lebron james is the black trump
and the first time i heard it i thought
no he's not
how does that make sense how is lebron
james the
the black trump and then he goes on to
explain it and i go
oh yeah he is the black trump it goes
like this
um lebron he's this is uh jason waylock
quote lebron fashions himself as a
dignified statesman
uh role model political activist and
champion of racial equality
he is every bit as crude undignified and
articulate as our sitting president
james writes james meaning lebron
writes and speaks at a third grade level
the athletic privilege he's enjoyed
that's right
you were not born with lebron james
physical abilities i wasn't
i wasn't born with his physical
capabilities he was born
privileged and he that he's enjoyed
since about
age 10 has spoiled and pampered him the
same way wealth and privilege spoiled
and hampered
president trump jason whitlock
argument made you are correct
now i would argue at some of his uh
characterizations of our president but
because specifically the part about his
vocabulary
because i think the president's
vocabulary is ideally suited
for the way he communicates with the
public but
the correlation and the analogy analogy
accepted
analogy accepted and so i think i'll be
calling lebron james black trump from
now on
because it's wonderfully delicious
all right that
is my program for today and i hope you
enjoyed
it um so the
the uh slaughter meter said it at 100
you should
you should expect that this coming week
will be really newsy
a lot of news going to come out and it
could change everything
so the slaughter meter could be anything
by tomorrow
but as of today it's 100
and that is my show for the day
all right periscope people have been
signed off and i'm still here with you
youtubers i like to spend a little time
looking at your comments
um
thank you it is the best part of the day
i agree
totally the best part of the day
all right that's all for me today and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
