everybody and welcome to the highlight
of civilization
and this day it's going to get even
better wow what a live stream I have
planned for you will I get double
canceled triple canceled I don't know
we'll see and if you'd like to enjoy
this at the maximum potential all you
need is a classic tanker chalices dying
the canteen yoga flask a vessel of any
kind play with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dope
immediate of the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
double canceled
could happen
so uh let's get right to the news
um have I ever told you about
the persuasion concept called Embrace
and amplify
where if somebody's doing something
that's like a little nutty but you can't
talk them out of it
instead of talking out of it you embrace
it and go with it until it looks so
ridiculous that the person will talk
themselves out of it
and sometimes I look at things in in the
wild and I say to myself
is somebody trying to do that or are
they serious
because you can't tell the difference
between somebody who's playing a prank
and trying to extend a bad idea until it
makes it look extra bad or if they're
really buying into it
I give you the following story
this is a real story I'm not making this
up
that Jill Biden I guess uh Secretary of
State blinken
they gave an award for international it
was the international women of Courage
award
and so the the winner of the
international uh
women of Courage award is a biological
male from Argentina who has transitioned
now
is the Biden Administration serious
about that
did they really do that
really
now I remind you that I'm a big
supporter of the trans community
the adults can do anything they want
that's the beauty of America right if
you're an adult it's your body yeah
I'm good with whatever whatever you need
to do so I'm a big supporter in that
sense
but
um I'm wondering if this is suggesting
that we need new vocabulary for things
I feel like the problem is that we only
have this one word women
or a woman
and and I think well if you only have
one word but everybody's fighting to be
the only one who's in it's like you know
the biological women are like no we're
the women and then the trans women might
be no we're women also but then people
are like oh the word the word needs to
be changed a little bit because it's not
it's not
you know accurate some say
well I think we could fix this by just
fixing our words
so instead of fixing the world
let me do what people on social media do
oh no I'm not going to change anything
in the world
I'm going to change the words because
once the words are changed everything
will be good
that's how we think and so I thought
why not take the word uh woman
which is w-o-m-a-n and we use that for
uh people who are born biologically male
but they transitioned
so they would be a woman and they get
their own word but the people who used
to be called women you know kind of the
classic old school you know
old-fashioned women they were like born
that way and just stayed that way kind
of boring old-fashioned well the boring
and old-fashioned women
born with vaginas and stuff they they
here's my new word
woman
w-o-m-b
A.M
so you could either be a woman
suggesting that you have a womb
which says nothing about your say gender
preference
it's not really a gender thing it's just
I got a womb
I got a womb I'm a woman
and but if you were
wanted to just keep the you know the old
name
the people who transitioned they could
have the name whoa whoa men
or Whoa man
and the others would be womans
and woo man
it's a good idea
no is that a good idea
or have I embraced and Amplified
have I taken something that was already
a little bit ridiculous
and just made it more ridiculous
yes I did
so am I serious no no I'm not serious
it's just funny
and by the way I will not back off from
the point that you can treat people with
complete respect the trans Community you
should always treat them with respect
like everybody else
but sometimes the situation is funny
right the way you play with words and
the political part of it that part's
funny
but it's not funny to discriminate
it's not funny to be trans People Are
People everybody's got to be an
individual
but it's uh interesting situation is
what I'm gonna say
in a real clear politics uh there was a
article by Larry Elder
who
did a what I call a uh a very accurate
job of describing my situation
in uh I'm not going to call this
supportive or non-supportive rather it
was just an accurate description of what
happened
and it stood out because it was in the
news
do you know how how rare it is for me to
read a news story that involves me
and there's nothing in there that's
wrong like there's no misstatement or
there's no mind reading you know I mean
I I think he said I was frustrated but
you don't have to read my mind to know
that
yeah that's sort of obvious so just so
you know it's out there
um
I got a big reaction for one of my
robots read news Comics that's my little
non-dilbert comic that I do mostly for
the locals subscribers but sometimes I
share and they like this one so much
they asked me to share it
so if you haven't seen it it's the
picture is the same every time it's just
a robot reading the news just sitting at
a desk and the robot says in the first
panel the so-called Q Anon Shaman has
reached a deal with Federal prosecutors
the star of the bloody January 6th
Insurrection has agreed to overthrow
Putin in return for his freedom
sources say he will accomplish the coup
using a combination of his selfie taking
and fashionable sauntering
so
people like that one
all right
so Jenna Ellis has reached some kind of
an agreement with a Colorado judge for
what's called a public censure
public censure
and they claim that there were at least
10 statements she made about the 2020
election
that were misrepresented
misrepresentations and I guess she's she
must have agreed to the following
characterization of her actions quote
she had a reckless state of mind and I
guess she had to sign that she agreed
with that because of a quote selfish
motive
which apparently she had decided that
she had
now
am I wrong or is she being censured by
mind readers because they determined
that they could tell her state of mind
and why she was acting and then they
made her sign an agreement that her own
interpretation of her State of Mind was
wrong and the mind reader's
interpretation of her State of Mind was
right
probably probably to avoid even bigger
legal
you know problems
did they just blackmail her into
agreeing with mind readers over her own
thoughts
that's what I think so
am I wrong
it was literally a thought crime
because here's the more common
explanation of why she did why she did
can we just remove four selfish purposes
who in the world Acts in a way that's
not for selfish purposes I mean even if
you're helping somebody
it's because you want to feel that way
right you want that's something you want
to you want that person to feel better
so everything is a selfish motive
so let's forget the selfish motive
effect she had to agree to Reckless
State of Mind
what the hell is a reckless State of
Mind
what about what if what if you just
believe what you're saying
what if you just believe what you're
saying
what if you one of the examples was
hyperbole she actually had to admit that
her hyperbole was not technically
accurate here was the hyperbole that
Hillary Clinton still hasn't accepted
the election that she lost
is that
is that a state of a reckless State of
Mind
or is it just an obvious hyperbole based
on the fact that Hillary Clinton still
says that Russians stole the election
for still
now if you ask me I would say that's
Hillary Clinton not accepting the
election except in a technical sense
yeah in a technical sense she accepted
it in a rhetorical sense she still says
Trump stole it
so if Jenna Ellis says that Hillary
Clinton's still not you know accepting
the election or whatever whatever the
wording was
and she had to she had to admit she had
a reckless state of mind and she said it
for selfish reasons
what
I I feel like this is a whole new level
I I've been
sort of afraid for a long time that we'd
start punishing people for their
internal thoughts
because we can see their thoughts better
than they can explain their own thoughts
now does that sound like something that
happened to me
if you look at you know my drama the
entire interpretation of my situation is
based on what I was thinking it's not
based on what I said
it is not based on what I said is
entirely based on what people who don't
know me
think I was thinking
you know that's true it was based on my
internal thoughts which which are
opposite from what I've expressed and
opposite from what I think
but external people have decided that
they have a better idea what I was
thinking what my intentions were
and then they punished me by
cancellation now I'm not complaining I'm
just describing and there's a reason
that I say that whenever When anybody
thinks I'm complaining about my
situation
that's mind reading
if I describe it
that's the only thing you know the only
thing you know is I described it
internally I'm not having a problem with
it at all not even a little bit
but everybody's like stop complaining
why are you complaining why'd you do
this for the wrong reason
it's entirely mind reading
we've got to the point where gen Ellis
and me
are both being punished
for some idiots mind reading
opinion of what's happening in our heads
this is really happening today
this is today
today people are being punished for mind
reading because somebody is a mind
reader literally happened today
right and I gotta say that watching you
happen to Jen Ellis is worse than
watching it happen to me because like I
say I don't like I'm not in stuck in the
past I'm already past it I'm way past it
I'm just having fun organizing what's
next
but watching it happen to somebody else
in my country
this is this is America people
you don't punish people because you're a
mind reader
like the we gotta stop doing that right
God is not doing that
all right
yeah we'll go easy on you if you sign a
document that says we read your mind
correctly that's basically what happened
to Jen Ellis
she basically had to sign a document
that other people knew what was in her
mind better than she did
that actually happened
like I'm really pissed off about this
and by the way it's not my job to defend
gen Ellis for anything she's done or
thought uh yeah that's not my job I'm
just saying this is really wrong in like
a serious serious way this is wrong
wow well speaking about what's right the
cable news ratings came out and as you
know Taco Carlson's been showing the
January 6th stuff a lot of interest in
that and apparently he just
destroyed the ratings of all the
competing Networks you just I think he
got more ratings than all of them put
together I believe that was the
reporting all of them put together were
less than he got
lesson Fox got but I think he was the
driver of that
all right uh do you remember I'm always
making fun of Carl Bernstein for having
a role as the worse than Watergate guy
that's right all right we're losing the
narrative we got to bring somebody out
to say it was worse than Watergate who
we got Carl you'll say anything come out
here oh oh Trump it's worse than
Watergate worse than Watergate all right
all right all right Carl you're done
it's worse than the water game it's
worse than what okay we got it we got it
yes it's worse than what stop it stop it
Carl
stop it we're just gonna put you on Ice
until we're losing the narrative again
that will drag you out it's worse in
order to stop it just stop it
but now they've got a new one
and now let me first say
there's someone who's service to the
country I appreciate and I also have uh
real empathy for the fact he got injured
but one of the I don't know how many
were injured but one of the injured uh I
think he's a Capitol Police Michael
Fanon
you've seen him he now worked for CNN
and he has a book out about his you know
situation on January 6 in this injury
Etc
so
he writes a uh he needs to write a
let's see an opinion piece which he
wrote for CNN to counter uh the Tucker
Carlson narrative and his narrative is
yes there was violence nobody's
questioning that
but that the larger characterization of
the event should have been more a
protest
than violent Insurrection but nobody you
know nobody is doubting that there were
you know there were there was violence
so here's what he writes in his uh
it is a penny piece
um
he talked also about the
some some texts and emails that have
been found from Fox News he says I
didn't need to read the reports of his
texts to know that Carlson's spin about
January 6 is fabricated I was there I
saw it I lived it I fought alongside my
brother and sister officers to defend
the capital
we have scars and injuries to prove it
all right
which part of Carlson's uh
spin or narrative did he debunk with his
facts
is there anything that he debunked with
his facts and his knowledge
no
because Tucker Carlson says yes there
was was violence all of that happened
it's documented
and so this guy says there was violence
there I was in it it was documented as
real
so he just agreed with Tucker Carlson
added nothing to the story added nothing
and declared the narrative was wrong
that's all he had
all he had was yeah the part that
violence that you agree happened I was
in it
so therefore you're wrong
no therefore he's right
because he said there were violent
things which we all condemned
and then
the new worst and water gay guy is
saying there was violence
which we all agree to
but because the thing we all agree to he
was part of
we should reject the larger story
because the part we agree to
we agree
that's what that's what CNN had today
that was their best their best push
they hired a guy just to be the new
now let me ask
if they didn't need him just to remind
you that there was violence do you think
he'd be working at CNN
do you think do you think that his
penetrating analysis of I was there
I was there I saw it I lived it was that
the penetrating opinion
uh that CNN's looking for no he was
hired purely as propaganda
he's literally the propaganda guy he
doesn't have anything to say except he
was injured which let me say again I
have a great empathy for anybody who's
injured and he was doing his job and
probably doing it as as well as it could
be done so I respect him totally for the
the work he did and and the injury he
took on behalf of the capital
I appreciate that as an American I
appreciate you but this is just
am I right it's just hiring
this guy to be the next worse than the
water gay guy
all right uh
there's a video that's I guess we're
going to call it re-emerging do you
remember around January 6th of these
videos you probably saw that purport to
show antifa
changing their clothes at the event you
know taking off their
or their uh all black outfits that they
used and then there's video of people
who appear to be antifa and all black
uh breaking through the at least some
window or trying to
now I wouldn't get too carried away with
that narrative
because like the violence which was you
know fortunately not many people were
involved with as horrible it was it
wasn't most people involved
but I I suspect that the antifa thing is
both real and not the biggest story
because I don't think it happened you
know I don't think much happened only
because of antifa but I do think that
they were there
and I do think that they they might have
been making it worse
I do think the FBI was there I don't
know if they made it worse
so there's a whole bunch of Bad actors
there
but they're not all they're not all
right-leaning actors
it's just that I don't know how much
weight to put on the antifa thing it
looks it looks like it's real
but it might have been you know a dozen
people it's hard to say
so I don't know what way to put on that
all right but as we're watching all you
know one conspiracy theory after another
being debunked these days I like to go
back to Charlottesville find people
march 2018 I think it was and ask you
this question
given everything you know about the
world in the last few years just what
we've learned about hoaxes and and how
the hoaxes are actually organized you
know they're not just things that people
believe they're organized hoaxes now
what do you think of this what are the
odds that the tiki torch carrying
neo-nazis from Charlottesville would
have one rally of that type
just once ever
now it is true that
it's been documented that members of
that March have been in other racist
marches now I don't doubt that I don't
doubt that some number of the Marchers
were real racist to do racist stuff
but do you know the uh what is it the
Patriot front
group that tries to be
you know they they March around in their
uh with their flags and their khakis on
they all look alike
yeah have you noticed that they they
didn't have one rally
they didn't have one
they sort of keep doing it
have you noticed that the clan when they
put on their funny outfits and stuff
there aren't many of them fortunately
you know it's a pretty small number of
people but did they stop doing events I
don't think they did they kind of keep
doing them
so was this the only organized and maybe
the biggest one maybe the biggest
organized group of self-confessed
racists
does it seem a little bit unusual to you
that that was a one-off event when
nothing is ever a one-off event
now some said oh they found out it was a
bad idea
did that ever stop anybody
do you remember when antifa found out it
was a bad idea because some people got
hurt and then they immediately stopped
and never had no that doesn't happen
if people get attention they do more of
it
it doesn't matter what else happened if
people get attention
they do more of it because it's an
attention-getting kind of thing so if
somebody gets hurt and there's even more
attention I'm not even sure that would
slow him down
so while I wouldn't reject the
possibility that a lot of the members
thought the heat was too much so they
just decided not to be part of it as
possible
but by today's standards
it seems in my opinion almost certainly
a Democrat op
almost certainly to me it just looks
like the Democrats were trying to take
Trump out by creating a situation that
showed that the country had become more
racist because of trump
so it was always used as the the signal
that Trump is bad for sure so it's
before it was like oh he says things
that are there there's maybe a an
invisible whistle you know but there's
nothing visual it's sort of a concept
it's about it's about the way he talks
yeah he talks in a way but not really if
he looked at technically what he says
it's not it's not racist but it's making
us think maybe he's racist in his mind
and they couldn't sell you what was in
his mind until they made it visual
scared the out of you
and then it became Biden's you know his
entire brand oh we don't want to have
more of that stuff the veins are bulging
through their their necks
right my my current assumption is that
it was a Democrat operation
you know it may have been run through
some shady group that hired real racists
now and again
no question they were real racists
I don't know what percentage were but no
question we're talking about real races
not not a fake organization it's just
that the organization of it the
crispness with which they acted that you
know the clean little tiki torches do
you think there would never again be a
tiki torch march by those same people
after that none of that makes sense now
I'm not going to say they're actors I'm
not going to say they're actors I don't
have to evidence of that I just think
they would not have been organized
unless I'd been an OP
it looks staged yeah so that's my
current opinion even though the racists
are real ones who have been in other
events that doesn't change the narrative
all right uh
so in Virginia as you know Governor
Younkin won maybe in no small part
because he wanted to get rid of critical
race theory in schools which was popular
enough
and he was a good enough politician uh
that he got elected
but now there are reports that the
Virginia teachers union is providing
these tool kits you know teaching guides
Etc that are just a sneaky way to to put
the CRT back in even though it's uh not
allowed
so the toolkit promotes 13 guiding
principles
of the black lives matter movement
uh so these include no I don't have them
all but I'm just taking this from a
report on Fox News see here are some of
the guiding principles working towards a
queer affirming Network where
heteronormative thinking no longer
exists
remember the this is written for kids
right so so kids will be learning that
uh
well when I say kids I'm talking about
the just the the
high-end language being used I suppose
they're talking to this to the teachers
when they're saying this but working
towards a queer affirming Network where
a heteronormative thinking no longer
exists I feel like the old way we said
that
was
three individuals with dignity you know
it's a free country
don't discriminate
that it feels like there were simple
words to say it you know it's a big tell
when you have to use a whole you have to
basically dump the dictionary on it if
you're dumping the dictionary on the
thing you're trying to say
uh that's a red flag right because
things that you believe that are good
and are real
you say in direct language
oh do not discriminate against the LGBT
community
right just direct instead of
uh I'll give you some more of this this
weird language here's another one
it talks about the disruption of Western
nuclear family Dynamics and a return to
the collective Village
and let's see my favorite one is coming
up we are committed to being
self-reflexive and doing the work
required to dismantle cisgender
privilege and uplift black Trans folk
especially black Trans women who
continue to be disproportionately
impacted by trans antagonistic violence
now who is that language written for
sixth graders I mean I guess it's for
the teachers but couldn't they give
teachers some language that the teachers
could then use
like why are you dumping the dictionary
on this
I mean dumping the dictionary it looks
you like you're trying to hide hide your
intention honestly
um
and lessons plans encourage students to
think about how they can get involved in
the black lives movement and other
causes a tip sheet for hosting a virtual
event how to organize build activists
for future engagements
but here's the best part this is a
research question for sixth graders
this is actually part of the toolkit I'm
not making this up according to Fox News
right I mean it wasn't there so I'm just
taking the news report as true
to be honest it doesn't sound true
if I I should take a moment
it was in the Wall Street Journal too
but it sounds so ridiculous that it
couldn't be true
but here it is
a research question for sixth graders is
quote how will you liberate yourself and
your oppressors
I think that's real
how will you liberate yourself and your
oppressors and by the way
Who are the oppressors
let's see who's mentioned they talk a
little bit about black Trans women
I wonder is that do they mean the black
Trans women or the oppressors
who could they be referring to
who else did they refer they talk about
uh let's say black lives matter but I
don't think they think that people in
Black lives matter are oppressors who
who could they be referring to as these
oppressors
I don't know it's still a mystery I
guess I'll have to do some research
myself
now wouldn't it be cool
it's this story
fit perfectly with the next thing I'm
going to talk about
wouldn't that be cool
next thing I'm going to talk about is
that there's an epidemic of depression
in young people especially young women
and Jonathan hate has a good sub stack
on this and he's talking about a
observation by Greg lucianov
who noticed that
in psychology
there's a thing called cognitive
behavioral training
so it's a set of tools to train somebody
to have better Mental Health
and I believe I believe it works
would you agree called CBT now if you
spend enough time on the internet you
might think CBT means something
different not cognitive behavioral
therapy same as you don't realize that
BBC is the British Broadcasting uh yeah
so you may have some confusion about the
CBT but what it means in this context is
cognitive behavioral therapy and most of
you would agree with a statement if
you've heard of it or you've used it
then it's a real useful tool is
basically telling you how to tell you
how to reframe your mind
to avoid depression you know I talk
about reframing all the time
if you if you see and one of the one of
the key parts of that
is teaching you to avoid catastrophizing
meaning avoid thinking that the world is
going to be destroyed and every little
problem is going to kill you you know
avoid thinking that climate change is
going to kill you personally avoid
thinking that this or that is off the
rails and it's the end of the world
avoid thinking that you know that so
that's part of CBT is to avoid thinking
it's the end of the world
another is to avoid thinking that you're
just a victim of things happening but
rather to reframe it as you have control
over your life yes everybody has good
lack of bad luck but you basically are
the Agents of your own life and if you
do that apparently your mental health is
much better
so at about the time that young people
started learning that they were victims
in a world in which many catastrophes
are happening are about to happen
they got mental illness and the the
mental illness line just went
and the hypothesis is
that the way kids are being taught
victims and victimology and you know the
world is going to hell and climate
change is going to fry you
creates not only does it create
mental depression bad mental health not
only does it create it but it's
literally
opposite of good technique cognitive
behavioral therapy
now
let's bring this all back to Something
Real
one of the biggest questions that I've
been getting since I got canceled is
Scott how you doing
how you doing are you okay
like almost everybody came to me and
said are you going to make it through
this
yeah how's your how's your mental state
are you are you okay mentally
the entire time that people were asking
me that I kept thinking to myself
what are you talking about
I'm in complete control of this
I don't even know why you're worried
about me
there was never a single point where I
said to myself oh I'm a victim of things
I've described it I've described what
happened but not once
did I think I wasn't in control of it
I did the thing that caused it I will
now do the things that move me to some
new place that I'll be happy with and
that it's all me doing stuff
that's my only view of the world now is
that an accurate world view is that is
that accurate not exactly but reframes
don't need to be accurate reframes do
not care about what's true
they only need to work that's a big
theme of my now canceled book which
you'll see eventually
it so you don't have to say to yourself
uh oh it's a little bit true that I do
certain things but it's also true that
other people do things so I'm trying to
you know understand it and it's
complexity no don't do that do not
understand this complexly
you're in charge go do what you need to
do
so
you can't get two better examples of the
fact that if you train people that have
mental illness they will
if you train people to reframe their
condition as they're in charge
they will avoid some of that
I also don't worry about the
catastrophes for the most part there was
one that scared me that the supply chain
problem during the pandemic the supply
chain problem scared me I have to admit
that one got me but that was real
you know what I mean that was real and
it was pretty short term and it couldn't
go in the other way I still bet on the
Adam's law of slow-moving disasters
which we'd have just enough time to
compensate and work through it and we
did so that so the prediction was better
than the way I felt about it so I
predicted correctly
I was pretty scared got I gotta admit
that's that's the only thing I can think
of in like the global disaster
situations of my entire life although I
think when I was 10 years old I was
afraid of a nuke from Russia
but between then not too much
so
um what do you think of the hypothesis
that teaching kids that they're victims
and basically their life depends
primarily on what other people are
thinking of them and doing
that is guaranteed to give you mental
illness
I don't have to be a psychologist to
know that that's just obvious
it's obvious
so now bring it all together
do you remember my my bigger play
when I was offending everybody with my
hyperbole
it was to draw attention
so that I could reframe the dominant
view especially in the black world and
people who are allies of the black World
which is that looking backwards
who victimized you
is not a good strategy
it's just not but I was taking it from
the point of view of not a good strategy
for Success meaning it doesn't get you
in the right place it is also a way to
make you mentally ill
I'm convinced of that that it doesn't
just make you less successful because it
cuts you off from the statistically best
ways to operate but it actually makes
you mentally weak
now have you noticed that events in the
world are slowly starting to line up
exactly the way I've been telling you
that they have been and that you can
start to see my situation in a little
bit of a different light now
is starting to move isn't it
do you know why it's starting to move
because I'm moving it
I'm moving it I have complete control of
this narrative
I'm on top of it I'm riding it like a
horse
and I'm going to take it where I want
will I succeed I don't know
I don't know uh am I crazy and and sort
of irrational because I'm thinking of it
as something I can control
a little bit in the sense that it's not
technically true like in a scientific
way right
but does it make me happy yeah
I I only have good days
I honestly only have a good days I just
don't have bad days anymore it's like
I've reframed it out of my life you know
unless I'm in physical pain or something
like you know when I when I had covered
for a while that wasn't wasn't the best
day but even when I had coveted true
story you know suffering along I still
had a whole bunch of good parts of my
day that I you know was glad about
all right well as the world uh
comes my way
I just want to point out the big picture
of what's happening there
yes yes I made a risk assessment you
know this this always uh is something
worth pointing out
if somebody says all right I'm going to
try to do something I know there's a 20
chance it'll all go wrong for some
specific reason and then you try the
thing and it goes wrong
and it goes wrong for that exact thing
you said was a 20 risk
you still did the right thing
and you still knew there was a risk so
you're not like surprised or baffled why
the bad thing happened you knew it was a
20 risk
as that's the way I act all the time
all right
I have a
new
um let's say opposite of the narrative
take on Russia and Ukraine
so here's the headline and see how you
interpret the headline so the headline
is apparently Russia had these really
good missiles that they had used
sparingly until yesterday and then they
sent 81 of these into the major cities
in Ukraine and apparently they're hard
to defend against because they're
launched from migs so The Bigs can be
you know anywhere when they launch them
so they're harder to defend because
they're sort of Close to You by the time
that they they launch and they could be
coming from any direction so they're
super accurate and super bad and they
got 81 of them that they could use in
one day
now would you say that that's a sign of
Russia picking up the pace and that they
have plenty of weapons
because they're using their best weapons
so this is showing you that they have
plenty of weapons and there's that
Russia is going to get on top of this
I don't see it that way
I think if they're using these weapons
it's all they got
and I'll bet they don't have a lot of
them
because it's the best weapons right the
best ones you always have fewer of them
for some reason maybe they're more
expensive harder to make whatever but
to me this is looking like
the signal that they're running out of
weapons
but it could be a signal that they have
so many weapons that they can use the
good ones in a quality quantity way
which way do you take it do you take it
as a signal that they have plenty of
weapons that they can use these good
ones like in a mass way or a sign that
that's all they have left
I'm leaning toward they don't have many
options left so they got to use what
they have and that's what they have
all right so
whenever I talk about Ukraine and Russia
what do I always tell you
it's all guessing because the
information coming out of there is you
know it's War information War
information is all wrong
because nobody has an interest in
reporting it correctly right both sides
only want to tell you what they want to
tell you they have no interest in the
truth no issues the truth doesn't have a
value in war
so you can't really believe any stories
that come out of there but you know
probably there were a lot of these big
weapons fired I mean I don't know about
the details but probably there were
I still spend time on only one narrative
yeah so
um I feel like I don't need to clarify
that so much but then people keep asking
so apparently I do I don't believe the
narrative that the ukrainians are
winning
does that help
does it I don't believe that narrative
but I also don't believe the narrative
that Russia is winning
so that gives you a better feeling about
it
all right
all right
um Scott and the ammo dumps yeah so it's
the same narrative so let me tell you
what I'm doing I I'm I'm giving you a
preferred not preferred
I'll give I'm giving you my best
um let's say prediction and guess
but I'm also putting a
a low level of confidence on it
does that work
I'm reading the tea leaves you know not
trusting the details but still getting a
Vibe and I'm and I'm making a prediction
but my confidence level
is love
is love so would I be surprised if
Ukraine surrendered in a week
you tell me would I be surprised if if
you crave just like surrendered in a
week now now because that's within my
that's within my world view my world
view is that anything could happen and
it could happen fast just anything it
could go either way really fast so I'm
not going to be surprised no wherever it
goes I just feel a little bit of a
like a little bit of a Vibe or a bias
toward russianism more trouble than the
news is reporting that's all
but we'll find out yeah I wouldn't live
or die in that prediction so don't
if you think it's a pro-ukraine stance
I'm not trying to that's not my
intention
but sometimes if you don't talk about
everything it looks that way
well thank you kicks Inc
I appreciate that all right I remind you
that the only place you'll be able to
see the Dilbert reborn comic this will
be the post cancellation version of
Dilbert we'll be on the locals platform
as
scottadams.locals.com is a subscription
site
so for uh if you do an annual
subscription it's five dollars a month
and you would get the daily Dilbert
and uh I'm gonna make this offer
if you if you're a subscriber
to uh if you're a subscriber to the
locals platform
you can you have automatic permission to
use the dilbrookovic in your
presentations right don't republish it
like a publisher you know don't put it
in don't put it in your Newsweek you're
in the newsletter every week that kind
of thing but for one off
if you find one and you want to use it
you have uh you have my provision I'll
put it in writing in case your corporate
bosses want to say it in writing but
I'll put it in writing somewhere on the
site and if you're a subscriber you have
permission to use it in your
presentations
just don't be a publisher of it that
would be competing okay now the comic
will be uh Saucier and I will take on
topics that I would not have taken on in
the newspapers
so if you're wondering how I'm feeling
you can't even understand
the creative relief
when I sit down to write the comment now
I enjoy writing it now I wasn't enjoying
it for a while because I was I was you
know coloring between these narrow lines
I'd be like okay
I'm between the lines that's okay and
now I just say what would be funny
just what would be funny and then I do
that
it's totally different the experience as
a Creator is completely transformed into
something that I'm like reborn I
actually have more
enthusiasm for you know what's ahead
that I've had in decades literally
decades because once you get locked into
you've got to do this and you've got to
do it this way well you're just locked
into it
I have one question though for you
should I use the f word in the second
comic of the series or would that be
because I'm not planning to do a lot of
swearing like it's not going to become
profane but I I like I love nose
a lot of nose
all right that's done
done
yeah the the
locals platform
is more persuasive to me than YouTube
because they literally pay a
subscription fee to be with me so I'm
definitely going to listen to their
opinion you know more than anybody who's
not on the platform all right I saw I
saw yeses and no so I'll acknowledge the
yeses but I think there were too many
no's
too many no's to ignore
all right because nobody's going to want
the comic because it had a had a bad
word
but some people might not want it
because that was one so that's that's
the calculation you do nobody will buy
it because of it but some will walk away
from it because all right all right
that's a decision
you see how we make decisions here
you know I've told you that I use I use
this experience as like a meta brain you
know I sort of give it the thought and
then the the collective brain of all the
people watching gives me the answer that
was exactly what I wanted my my own
brain was
not solving for that so I just put it
out there and then you solved it for me
good job
all right
I'm going to say goodbye to YouTube and
I'll talk to you tomorrow
