good morning everybody
congratulations
on making it to the finest moment
of all civilization yes it's called
coffee with scott adams and there's no
better place in the world to be in fact
this is a show that's been uh enjoyed by
well let's see
humans
raise your hand if you're human
good good i see a lot of humans how many
of you are birds
are there any birds out there
i understand that there's a
cockatoo
named kaley or casey casey
casey right
yes casey
so i'd like to speak directly to casey
the cockatoo for a moment because i i
know casey is watching
so if you could bear with me
casey
casey
good bird
good bird
good bird
casey want a treat
casey want a treat
good bird
all right that was just for the cockatoo
now i there may be other cockatoos
watching
if i didn't mention your name
i am talking to you too all of the
cockatoos
and uh
some of you i know have had a good
morning already and
maybe you've had a cockatoo too
but let's do something that we call the
simultaneous
sip it goes well with terrible puns and
all you need is a copper mugger glass
attack or chalice or stein that canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here today i
think makes everything better the thing
that will make your
bird
talk
it's called the simultaneous sip put
your beak in it and enjoy now
yeah yeah
every time i'm surprised at how good
that is
well the airlines the ceos a bunch of
them have asked the government to drop
the mask mandate
and uh
the only reason they're giving
is that um
there's no reason not to
since
people are huddling in bars and
restaurants every day and do you notice
the difference between an airplane
and a bar in a restaurant
an airplane actually has good
ventilation
unlike your restaurant and bar
so these ceos have just said uh why are
we waiting another what month or so to
drop these ask requirements
and i have a hypothesis which maybe
somebody has some data to
to validate
why would anybody book a trip
between now and the time that the masks
are non-mandated
if you're planning a trip why in the
world would you book a flight
in the month before the mask mandate
drops if you have a choice
you're going to wait until the mass
mandates drop are you not
now business people may have less choice
but even they have a lot of flexibility
i mean most people
yeah most people can move their vacation
a week or so a few weeks so my guess is
that the airlines are getting crushed
in the current period because
everybody's saying you know if i just
wait three weeks
i don't need a mask or whatever it is
yeah so i'm seeing in the comments
people say they're intentionally waiting
for the mass community so i think
finance
follow the money guarantees where things
are going the airlines will get their
mask thing dropped i believe now all 50
states have dropped mask mandates
i saw that but i don't believe that's
true
is it true that all state mandates are
dropped and all that's left is
federal because i
because i thought that mass
transportation was always masked
no matter who owns it
is that right
hawaii hasn't so hawaii hasn't
uh but has hawaii announced when they
will
yeah
well i i didn't believe it i don't
believe that all 50 states have dropped
all mass mandates i don't think that's
true but they will
all right
let me check in with you
i think you know this since the
beginning
i've been saying that you don't have to
worry about the mandates being permanent
now some of you said scott you don't
know
when the government gets some power they
never release it well
that's true but this wasn't like any
other situation right
and the united states is not like other
countries we are a little bit more
rebellious
often in a productive way
and it didn't seem to me that
the united states could keep mandates
i don't know i don't know if anybody can
but i don't think it's going to happen
here so if you
uh it did take them too long yeah you
could argue that for sure
but you know the government takes too
long for everything
so check your thinking if you believe
that this was going to be masks forever
it was part of a larger
global conspiracy maybe that won't
happen we hope
dental office tools create particles
that easily penetrate n95
well that's a weird specific comment but
i'll bet you're right
all right
i have a uh
proposal and i was reading about the
congress has a plan
uh they're thinking about mailing out
stimulus checks
to people
to help them pay for gasoline because
gas prices are so high
and i thought you know
that's not going to work
because if you send out stimulus checks
in the short term that might help them
by gas but in the long term it's going
to increase inflation right
because the
the
stimulus checks will not be paid for so
it has to be borrowing
and so therefore i don't think that's a
good plan but
um sometimes a bad plan
will suggest a good plan you'll hear
somebody's bad plan you go that won't
work but you know
if you just made one tweak to it
so the problem with their plan is that
it's not funded so i propose a new
federal tax on gasoline
we'll put a new federal tax on top of
whatever taxes there are and the new
federal tax will fund
the stimulus payments that will go to
the public
to help them buy the gas
that was funded by the tax on the gas
now then you have a closed system
now i don't please plea on locals people
are calling me brilliant
and i don't think i deserve it i don't
i can see objectively this does seem
kind of genius i can see how you think
that but please you're embarrassing me
you're embarrassing me
anybody could have come up with this
idea i think i mean
sure it was me
this time it was me but
i like to think it's not about me
it's we
it's we
there's no i in team
but as kobe uh
as kobe bryant once said
to shaq o'neal yeah there's no there is
no i in t but
there's a me in that
all right um
so that's my idea
um i did a tweet yesterday to cause some
trouble
a little provocation
i did a little bit too well
sometimes when i try to provoke
i overshoot the mark a little bit and i
did it again creating yet again
another rumor about my opinions that
will haunt me to the end of days
and here's my mistake slash
funny tweet
are you all aware
that the word decimated
is almost always misused in popular use
does everybody know that
most people use the word decimated to
mean almost completely destroyed
something
oh you decimated that city oh it's 90
percent destroyed
the actual definition historically of
decimated and that's why the death part
the dec part comes from which means 10
decimated means you you defeated or you
destroyed 10 percent
of something
10
now i did look up the definition before
i talked about this because i wanted to
see if popular use had shifted the
definition and it has actually it has
so now it's
a substantial
or significant destruction
of an army or something else
so it's not limited to 10
but it's any substantial
so i would say
15
would be substantial you know that would
be decimated according to the modern
thing
so
there was a report from u.s officials i
don't know who was pentagon or somebody
and nothing you could trust
so when i say this information came from
the government
and i don't specify which part of the
government
it doesn't matter
what part of the government said it
because it's not something you should
believe anyway it wouldn't matter who
said it it's not believable in a time of
war which is how many
how many people have died on the other
side
we don't know how many russians have
died
we don't really know that
so you know you shouldn't believe it but
the report was that as much as 10
percent of the military
let's say full capacity not just people
but the capacity of the russian military
has been degraded by 10
so i tweeted oh
they've literally been decimated
which caused many people to say scott
how could you fall for that ukrainian
propaganda
to which i said uh oh i've done it again
now there's a permanent record on the
internet since i i keep the tweet up
this seems to indicate to some people
that i believe the ukrainian propaganda
now
is there anything i believe less than
ukrainian propaganda
i don't know
if you were to make a list of all the
things i believe
i'm pretty sure that near the bottom of
it would be
ukrainian war propaganda
that might be just about the least
likely thing i'm going to believe
but i did make a tweet that led people
to believe that so forever i will be
hounded by the belief
that i believe the opposite of what i
believed and now you know
decimated
is about 10 percent
now i
i think i saw a tweet by jeff pilkington
suggesting that the match up for
president that would make the most sense
for both parties
would be gavin newsom against ron
desantis
the theory being that they are two
people who let's say prove themselves
during the pandemic
now democrats would say that newsome did
a good job
maybe you wouldn't
maybe you wouldn't but that's not the
point right
they only have to get enough votes to be
elected they don't need your vote per se
and
democrats of course would say that ron
desantis did everything wrong
republicans would say you did everything
right so forget about whether you like
him or not do you buy do you buy the
concept
that um let's just talk about the
democrat side do you buy the concept
that newsom is their best shot
let me see now forget about whether you
think he'd win
and forget about whether you think he's
good in an absolute sense
in a competitive sense since they have a
pretty weak bench
do you think he'd have the best chance
of winning
even if he couldn't win
yeah i see a lot of people saying yes
yeah
i mean it's split like everything but
there are more people saying yes and now
and a lot of it has to do with the fact
he's got the act
he's got the look he's got the
the mannerisms and now he's got you know
serious
credentials for you know his uh
his background he's got the hair he's
got the look he he's got sort of the
the surface package but here's something
that i read about him today
i assume this will pass the fact check
that la robberies are that involve
firearms
so in los angeles robberies that involve
firearms have increased 44 percent this
year
according to the city's top cop
how do you get elected president
when the crime in one of your biggest
areas of your state increased 44 percent
do you know how easy it would be to be
him
every time somebody asks you a question
let's say let's say it's either trump or
desantis running for president on the
republican side
every time they're asking a question
about the other side just say
i want you to fact check this
did did armed robbery really go up 44
under newsom
and then they'll say um but
mr trump we're we're asking you about
ukraine
and then if i were trump i'd say i
understand what you're asking me
but do you understand
that you're asking me to comment on
somebody
whose leadership rose armed robbery by
44 of the year
why would i even talk about any of his
other opinions
how could it possibly matter what he
thinks about world events
because if you elect him
you're going to get exactly what you
what the package told you you were
getting
if you get newsome
read the ingredients
part of the ingredients are
increased armed robbery 44 in one year
that's what you're buying
so
you know no no politician would ever do
what i recommended which is only talk
about one thing about the competitive
the whole time
but it'd probably work
it would probably work you know nobody's
ever going to do that because it would
be boring but it'd work
all right
um
here's your daily propaganda warning
uh this one comes from glenn greenwald
now i feel like it's actually useful to
repeat this every day or two
which is to remind you
that your side is lying to you too
that's really hard to
kind of really incorporate into your
thinking because we're just sort of
biased toward thinking our side is maybe
not right all the time
but it's more right than the other side
isn't it
how do we know
and we have no way to know that and
glenn reminds us
he tweets uh if you're in the u.s or a
nato country you're in a radically
closed propaganda system much dissent
has been banned or demonized to the
point of invisibility
and maybe you're still 100 right
but uh at least recognize that everyone
in war is propagandized warranting
skepticism in other words don't trust
your own side
good advice don't trust your own side in
fact don't trust the pundits
in a time of war i don't think you could
trust anybody
because everybody's got a you know an
agenda
and that includes me but at least i've
told you what my bias is
the best you can do i think is tell
people what your bias is
like you know you can't
um
you can't do much better than that
um
so here's
a story
and this is a narrative diversion story
so
why is it that ukraine is doing such a
good job of defending
we've heard several reasons have we not
here are some of the reasons we've heard
we've heard that the russians have low
morale
and the ukrainians have high morale
did i just tell you that everything from
your own side
is propaganda
as well as the other side
right so when your side your own side
tells you here's one of the reasons
it's because the ukrainians have high
morale and the russians have low morale
now it could be true
because it certainly feels like it might
be true doesn't it
kind of feels like it might be
but i don't know that it's true
i don't know and i don't know that it
makes a difference
it might not make a difference but it
could also be true
um
here's another thing that we're hearing
is that the russians are using bad
tactics and bad equipment
you know bad maintenance bad tactics
now is that true is that true
is it a coincidence that the enemy let's
say russia is sort of the enemy for
propaganda purposes is it true that the
enemy is always incompetent and
you know they can't maintain their
equipment it might be
i mean it might be a little bit true but
how would you know
you wouldn't know
you wouldn't know that at all
you have no way of knowing that somebody
told you that
now
here's my question and it's sort of it's
not quite the dog not barking but maybe
you can figure out how to label this
what's left out
is there not
something that's a little left out
well
this narrative was uh
boosted again by a story that says the
green beret the american green beret
forces
have been training the ukrainians quite
seriously since russia took crimea
now if your green beret
are training you to um
to create an armed resistance which is
what they do
apparently they're really good at it
according to our own government
who
can't really believe kenny
but
i feel as if people who have been
involved in the green break could
confirm this and maybe some of you have
is there anybody here who's been
involved in the green beret
because i do
think even though you can't believe you
can't believe you're a government i do
think it's likely that the green beret
do a solid job can anybody confirm that
has there anybody been in the green bray
who's watching this would say yeah yeah
this is real we we
yeah their primary mission is training
other forces right the green beret
mostly goes in and trains the locals to
be a force multiplier
i mean i'm seeing some people confirm
this real but
let's say it is real
so now we have these three reasons so
far
why ukraine is doing better than most
expected high morale
bad russian tactics and equipment i
guess and then the green beret
trained the ukrainians to be effective
fighters especially in their local
terrain
there's still something missing
now of course there have been lots of
stories about the high-tech equipment
that we've given them
but here's what i think
i think the high attack the the
high-tech weapons
are the actual main story this other
stuff is important
that the green bray probably made a big
difference
but i think
that the narrative is trying to
shift us away from the equipment aspect
it's trying to shift us onto the human
aspect
so the human aspect is are do you have
high morale are you well trained
you know do you know how to maintain
things
do you have good tactics
isn't it interesting
that all of the propaganda that we're
being
subjected to
is telling us that it has really don't
don't look at the drones
no no yeah they're we are sending drones
we are we're definitely sending them
uh shoulder mounted rockets but you know
that's
that's not the reason
that's not the reason the ukrainians are
winning no it's not that they have
thousands and thousands of
easy-to-operate
deadly
weapons that are designed exactly to
destroy the things that are destroyed
destroying no it's not the weaponry
it's all about the
human part
correct me if
i've gone too far
but here's my hypothesis
if if russia said
who trained these guys and they found
out it was the green bray let's say the
americans had trained the ukrainians
would you say that america is in the war
no because the training is something
that happened
but may not be happening at the moment
so we're not in the war
we simply did some things that ukraine
found useful to be in the war
so if you're talking about the human
part
it's really easy to make the argument
that the united states is not in the war
we're not in the war we're not in that
war
but
suppose i said to you this
the reason that ukraine is winning is
that they have american weapons
and that we didn't even sell them to
them
we gave them to them
we gave them the weapons
i think right don't we give them the
weapons
that sounds like you're in the war
because when the russian gets shot
or when a russian gets killed
it's being killed by a weapon that's
right there right now
that's current
that's not you used to train us and now
we're good on our own
that was the past but the weapon that
killed you that's sort of today
and i have a feeling that
because
uh
giving any country high-tech weaponry
can change the course of the war
more so than almost anything right
erica you're too nice thank you
so i have a feeling that the propaganda
we're seeing is diverting us from the
hardware part of the story and i'm going
to reaffirm my
prediction
that when this is all over
we're going to learn that the
ukrainian fighters had more than just
the weapons we know about
that they had they had what what i'm
calling the good stuff
there might be some new weapons you have
not heard of
that might be getting a little test
that's what i think now i don't know if
those weapons will be you know the
majority of the reason but certainly the
high-tech weapons is the story in my
opinion
i think the high-tech weapons are the
story
all right um
cnn uh
may have assassinated a russian general
now
we always tease cnn about being you know
deep state owned and
cia
controlled and stuff like that we don't
know you know hard to validate that
stuff
but
cnn's running a story
that goes roughly like this so there was
a rare
face-to-face meeting between russian and
u.s military
now apparently that hasn't happened in a
while and it's sort of rare
and
doing it during the ukraine war was
doubly rare
and the way cnn reports this is that the
russian general
doesn't matter who he is you won't
remember his name anyway
who is normally stoic
doesn't show much emotion
was asked about his uh ukrainian ties
because i guess he was born in ukraine
so there's a russian general
fighting a war
against his own home country
and the report is that he was uh he sort
of lost his composure which is
uncharacteristic
and that they saw a break in his let's
say morale
or that or his
this seemed to indicate that he was not
totally on board with the war
they just killed him
think about it
cnn is reporting a direct anecdote
of putin's general
being not so up for the war
and then that became a news story and
there's a risk that the soldiers and the
russian army could actually hear that
story
i mean it's hard they're because they're
kind of sheltered but do you think putin
wants a story about one of his generals
one of his generals saying he's not so
hot about the war and he was born in
ukraine
looked like you
right
now tell me i'm wrong
did cnn just assassinate a russian
general
am i
wrong
i'm not wrong
they just they just took out a general
do you think that cnn did this story
without prompting
do you think the cia or somebody in the
military or the government
said to cnn i got a story for you
and i've got some inside information we
don't usually
provide the notes of a meeting like this
but we're going to provide you the notes
this time
if you write this narrative
because we're going to kill we're going
to kill a general with news
i think cnn took him out
now he may not die die
but he's going to be off the job is he
not
will he be locked up by today
and if he's not it only means putin
hasn't heard about it
right
does anybody disagree with me the cnn
just took on a general and almost
certainly was a war related move almost
certainly guided by whoever fed them the
information
i'm not wrong
i don't think i'm wrong i think they
just assassinated a russian general
with the media
i think i think that just happened
how many of you noticed
that's the weird part
if i hadn't mentioned it
you wouldn't have noticed cnn
assassinating a top general
it just happened
in effect
all right
the supreme court nominee has
had at least one interesting moment
in which she was asked to define a woman
and then she said well i'm not a
biologist
and then everybody pounced
they said wait a minute wait a minute
if you have to be a biologist
wouldn't that suggest there's a
biological basis for male and female
and that's of course counter to the
left's hypothesis
or maybe philosophy that uh people can
choose their gender or that or that
let's say you're let me say it better
that your genitalia or your reproductive
ability
does not define
if you're male or female that would be
their point of view
now
the weirdest thing
the weirdest thing about this
is uh
i was watching i thought i made a note
about it dershowitz
did anybody see durchuis talk about uh
his old student uh cruz oh here it is so
ted cruz asked
what dershowitz called an absurd
question
so is ted cruz who was asking
if if
if somebody was born with let's say male
or female genitalia
could change their gender
why couldn't he as a
what do you say
latino could he change his identity to
black
now forget about what
the supreme court nominee jackson said
this is what alan dershowitz said about
this
he acted like he was a little
embarrassed because ted cruz had been
his student at harvard
and dershowitz i've been watching for a
long time and i've been quite a
supporter of his logic
you can make your own opinions about his
personal life and what he has or has not
done i'm not talking about that
you're all welcome to that opinion i
won't even try to influence you just to
have your own opinion about his you know
his own life
but
this is the first time
i've seen him be
outrageously illogical in public
it's the first time so even when i would
disagree with him on a topic which would
happen now and then
what i'd hear his logic and say ah damn
it that's good logic
here he has no logic let me walk through
it
so he claimed
that you know he agreed with the notion
that you can choose your gender
regardless of your genitalia all right
so jersey says that's a fact but it's
ridiculous to say that you could choose
your race
do you know why do you know why it's
why it makes sense that you could choose
your gender
but it doesn't make sense that you could
choose your ethnicity here's the reason
he gave you
i'm gonna paraphrase this is not exactly
what he said
but it's something like this
well of course you can change your
gender
because people do it
and of course it's absurd that you could
change your race
that was his argument
that's not an argument
that's nothing
like he couldn't even he couldn't even
wave his arm at it
he was absolutely stumped
and this is alan dershowitz
right dershowitz is not somebody who
doesn't have an argument
and he didn't have an argument he didn't
have anything he basically wanted to
mock it away
uh let me do the argument in more of my
own style
so i'll try his argument again but more
you know my
my uh presentation of it
of course you can change your gender
look at all the people who've done it
and he actually argued that the people
who have
done gender reassignment surgery he says
he knows two of them very well
and that they're unambiguously happier
because they made the change
and so he argues
that because they were happier
unambiguously he knows them well i mean
he has no question that they're happier
they're happier having made the change
and therefore
that's evidence
that you can change your gender
because the people who did it
are happier
do you see a problem with the logic
do you see that he effortlessly changed
from is it a fact that you can change
your gender
he changed it to
people who do it are happier
that's not the argument
have you heard anybody say
there's no example of somebody who did
gender surgery and came out happier is
there anybody on any side of the
argument who's ever made that argument
i don't believe so
i believe he was he was pretending
there's an argument
that people who do a gender assignment
are some somehow always unhappy about it
nobody makes that argument
it's i think it's observably true that
some people make the change and they're
quite happy about it i don't know what
percentage
but it's i mean do you doubt it is there
anybody here who thinks that nobody's
ever been happy
with a gender reassignment
does anybody think that or do you think
like
you know in the back of their mind they
wish they hadn't done it
yeah so some of them have to be happy
about it now that so this is a complete
breakdown in the dershowitz logic
um
fortress if you will i mean he's a solid
logical guy but he just he just he just
threw it all away on this now
i'm going to give him i'm going to
backtrack down and give him some credit
he also told you exactly why he's biased
if somebody gives an opinion that
doesn't make sense
and then they tell you why
okay here's why it doesn't make sense he
kind of did that and the way he did that
was by talking about his personal
friends
that are happier
and when he says it must be true because
i have personal friends and they say
they're happier and i observe that to be
true
he's telling you his bias
right
that's pretty direct
he's not saying i have a bias because
but if he says
if he says i have these friends and
they're happy and that means something
he's telling you that's his bias
so i'm going to give him a partial pass
for being illogical because he told you
why and it was a human reason
it was a human reason
right it wasn't a robot reason
he was a human being he said you know
these are my friends
it looks like it works for them i'm
going to back them you know he didn't
say that but it looks like he's backing
his friends and their choice
and it looked like he had departed the
law and logic for a human reason
i support that
i support him taking humanity over logic
in any anytime really but in this case
that's fine
but he did depart logic entirely because
if you can if you can choose your gender
you can choose anything
i think most of you would agree with
that
here's how i think
oh there's a story about the richest
oligarch
that still hasn't been put in prison i
guess and that he's not being
sanctioned because he might be a way to
help negotiate with putin
that would be interesting but i can't
see putin being influenced by any
rich russian
it just doesn't sound like that makes a
difference i don't know
i wouldn't wait for that to happen
um here's my persuasion suggestion for
ukraine
and you know everything has to be a b
tested you can never be sure something
will work but here's what i would have
been tempted to do
ukraine has shown lots of pictures of
dead russian soldiers
but correct me if i'm wrong
we see usually one
or maybe there would be three
you know spread out in a little area
that's in a picture or a video
if you see videos of individual soldiers
dead
does that make you worry about let's say
you know your son who's a soldier well
yes
but you also tell yourself well that's
just one
you know there are a million soldiers
that's that's one
but suppose ukraine there's a story of
one city that's having a problem with
all the corpses so it was a city that
the russians attacked
unsuccessfully
as the as a
uh as the snow is thawing
there are a whole bunch of bodies they
have to deal with
and here's what i would have done as
horrible as this sounds i i understand
this sounds horrible but remember it's
war
i would collect up as many russian
bodies as i could
and i would pile them in a mound
but i might
i might fake it a little bit i might put
something under the pile
so it looks like it's all a pile of dead
soldiers but that you know you could
tell clearly it's lots of individual
dead russian soldiers and then show
don't show the military throwing them on
the pile
show the town's people
collecting them and dragging them up to
the pile and throwing them on
and
if you were a russian mother
and you watched a video of a pile
of russian dead soldiers and you saw the
locals not the military not the military
you saw the locals
tossing them on a mound
like firewood
that will change your mind
now let me give the ukrainians some
advice apparently they've talked to
israel
but israel must have kept from them
their best
technique
have you ever seen a holocaust picture
that involved one person
are we done here
have you ever seen the holocaust picture
that involved one person well okay you
have right yeah yes you have
but
so celibate let me withdraw the question
of course you have
but that's not the main persuasion the
main persuasion is groups
right the stuff that moved you
the things that moved you
was the group pictures the group deaths
the group incarceration with multiple
starving people etc
the ukrainians have somehow not used
that technique now i suppose there's a
risk it could backfire
could backfire because it might maybe
would make the russians
more willing to fight so they don't meet
that faith i don't know but it seems to
me that
the the propaganda of visual persuasion
is being completely
blown by the ukrainians
because
the onesies and twosies are selling a
story of rarity
let me say it again
if the visual persuasion that they're
sending is here's a dead soldier
here's one tank
it sends a it sends a message of rarity
of those things if you show piles
it sends a message of volume
they're missing the persuasion here it's
got to be a volume
that they've got to sell not not
individual anecdotes
um there was a russian warship i guess
it was a
transport carrier for i don't know
troops and tanks and stuff they got
blown up in one of the ukrainian ports
to which again i asked this question
how hard is it to blow up a ship when
it's on your shore
or in port
i don't know much about
war
but wouldn't that be the easiest thing
you could do
i mean if you had the right equipment i
assume you'd need a shoulder mounted
rocket of some sort
um i don't understand why there's no
such thing as remote-controlled
drone torpedoes
or are they
and how big would a how big would a
missile have to be
to put a a sinking hole in a ship if it
hits below the water line
it doesn't have to be that big does it
i mean it'd have to be a special type i
think it'd have to stick to the hull
and then then blow up or something so
probably needs some science on it
somebody says radio control doesn't work
underwater does gps
does gps work underwater
there are drone subs but we don't have
much information on them somebody said
so here's the question
are you telling me that america does not
have
a drone sub
that you could carry
that you could actually carry it might
take two people or something but that
you could carry
and just drop it in the water and sort
of aim it in the right direction and it
would just blow up something a mile away
we don't have that
i feel like we do
is there anybody here who would know if
such a thing exists
somebody says torpedoes go about
more than a mile okay
but then you've got the
aiming and navigation part if it's too
far
we do but the ukrainians don't well
that's the question isn't it
we do but the ukrainians don't
do you think they still don't
we are giving them neptune missiles
shore to ship all right somebody do a
google and tell me uh what distance a
neptune missile
fired from the shore
um
can reach
germans have a torpedo with 50 kilometer
range somebody says
uh scott please change the subject no
no
because the reason i talk about this
stuff is for prediction purposes
if you want to predict where the war is
going
knowing the technology
i think is the key
because we we kind of have a handle on
the other stuff it's clear that the
ukrainians are fighting it's clear that
they're trained it's clear that they're
not giving up
beyond that you kind of don't need to
know the weapon all right
i will change the subject
lindsey graham as
being a
theatrical and he's going to maybe vote
against jackson
because he's mad that
let's say
however long ago it was janice rogers
brown who was a black woman that george
bush nominated
so she was turned down by the dems and
now graham is saying hey i'm just going
to return the favor
because
it would have allowed under bush it
would have allowed the republicans to
nominate the first black woman for the
supreme court and the democrats didn't
want the republicans to get that win
and so that's the reason they stopped
the nomination not the qualifications of
the judge
not the qualifications of the judge
and
so lindsay is deciding to basically pay
them back
now here's my decision
how does that work
like
like what's his point
so lindsay does the same thing to them
that they did to him
and that will make them
less likely to do it in the future
or would they be more likely to do it
because
the other team did it
um now i understand
there there's a republican point of view
that i hear a lot
what time is it
how'd my phone disappear
that's weird
um you're gonna have to tell me the time
um
so
somebody's oh thank you somebody's gonna
have to tell me
how the lindsey graham strategy works
just explain it to me in words
all right so so this is what i'm looking
for
so the lindsey graham strategy is to pay
them back for what they you act the same
way
and so because you did that
probably the judge will still be
confirmed so it probably has nothing to
do with this judge
won't have any impact
what is this point
and i'm not even saying it's a bad idea
i'm not saying it's a bad idea or a good
idea i don't i don't i don't connect the
dots
so he does this
and then
the rip is his theory is the theory he's
working on
that the democrats will then
uh
will then see the light and stop acting
that way
like
explain it how does it work
and do you think that any show that
lindsey graham goes on
you know which typically will be like a
fox news show do you think anybody in
fox news is going to ask him that
question
uh how does that work
like what how does that make the world a
better place how does it make
republicans look better to voters
how does it stop a nomination how does
it do anything
how does it possibly work
and you know i'll say to you again that
the republicans had free money here
absolutely free money
all they had to do is unanimously
put this woman in
and imagine the news from that point on
from that point on
and even today i saw the news saying
what the votes were so i guess scalia
got in and like a
like a 90 to nothing vote
and i think uh
what's the name ginsburg
i think she got in on a
like 87 to 3 or something like some
crazy number
and then more recently yeah and thomas
was 52-48 but more recently it's been
close
um somebody says wow you are not aware
of human democrat uh motivation and you
know what somebody just said i'm not
aware of democrat motivation
i'm still not
because that comment didn't help me but
you know what if it would fit good in
that space
a description of the motivation that you
think they have that i'm missing
so please
if you think you can describe it in a
sentence i think you can
tell me the democratic motivation that
i'm missing
this is on the locals platform so you
don't see these comments
uh
yeah
okay
so here's what here's what the
republicans have missed but not yet i
mean they could still grab this if the
republicans can find a way to give a 100
support to a female black qualified
candidate even when they have some
questions because they do have some
issues with her but if they can find a
way to do that
the republicans win
because they'll always have that on
their record
and then the next time the democrats go
against the republican nominee do you
know what the
every story has to print
well you know we gave your candidate 100
support
that's the position they should put the
democrats in
to explain why they're not giving 100
support
because even even the news that supports
the democrats
would ask that question
even cnn would it would make them answer
the question
am i wrong
i think even cnn would say you know
let's take jake tapper
i know i know you you have your
criticisms of jake tapper and
that's not the point
you don't think that jake tapper
would ask the democrats why they don't
do
what the republicans did and say okay we
know which way this is going to go
so let's just show our support
i think he would ask i think he would
ask and i think the democrats would have
a tough time
wrestling with the question
so i think the republicans are making a
gigantic strategic mistake
to die at the altar of fighting
instead of fighting smart
let me give you this advice
fighting smart
excellent idea
excellent idea
fighting because you think fighting is
good
bad idea
bad idea
let me say it again because i know a lot
of people are missing this
good point
fighting when fighting is a good idea
and you have a chance to win and you've
got a good strategy good idea
good idea
fighting when you know you can't win and
it's only going to make everything worse
this will surprise you
bad idea thumbs down
that's my advice to republicans fight
the fights you can win
and the ones you can't win take a win
any way you can get it
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is
bringing us to the conclusion of the
best live stream
that has ever been broadcast anywhere in
the world at any time to anybody
and i ask you this
so far i have been completely able to
identify as
a black
citizen
have you been surprised that i've gotten
no pushback from that
anybody
because i keep saying it like
prominently in public and by the way i
will say it i will say it on national tv
if i'm doing a book tour or something if
i get interviewed i will say it on
national tv and i will say it
completely straight
i mean i'll tell the i'll say the
reasons because there's nothing hidden
the reasons are that it's my option
and i kind of i like it
i don't need to give you a reason i just
have to prefer it
and know it's an option
so i prefer it i know it's an option
it gives me very discreet benefits if i
should choose to take them so for
example if i were to sign up for some
government program or something that
let's say it favored minority applicants
for loans
i would sign up identify as black
nobody can question it because those are
the rules and i would get those benefits
am i wrong
i would
now i wouldn't specifically do that
because i'm rich and i wouldn't you know
if you're rich you don't want to use a
weasel way to steal money from black
people
that'd be like the worst thing you could
do so i wouldn't actually do that but
there have to be situations that will
come up in my life
in which identifying as black might be
an advantage
so i have that option and you don't
unless you're black
yeah
there's somebody here identifying as a
six foot two stud
i accept your identification
so what
[Laughter]
i think there's somebody
italian american on here who says
they're just glad i don't identify as
italian
i i can feel that remark i see where i
see where you're going with that
i see your point
all right
that is about all i have to say today
and i would like to leave you with that
youtube thanks for joining us
best show ever
