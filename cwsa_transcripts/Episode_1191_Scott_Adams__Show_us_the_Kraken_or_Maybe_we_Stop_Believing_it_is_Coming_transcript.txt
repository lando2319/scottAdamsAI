hey everybody
come on in it's time yeah
it's time for coffee with scott adams
best time of the day and we'll be
looking for the kraken today
yes we will but first i would like your
opinion
i've been trying to print my notes for
today
to my printer my printer
has decided not to print my notes
doesn't give me an error message doesn't
tell me what to do has plenty of paper
and plenty of ink
but it just won't print and what i need
for you
is an opinion should i rip it out of the
wall
and throw it off of my balcony so we can
watch it crash in pieces on my sidewalk
below
or should i just calm down and let it go
so i'll i'll leave it to you should i
destroy it on camera
or should i let it go but first
in order to enjoy this day to the
maximum
you're going to need a cup or a mug or
glass a tanker tells you sign a canteen
drug or flashback vessel
of any kind and fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the
ultimate it's the dopamine hit of the
day it's the thing that makes everything
better
except the kraken and it happens now
it's called the simultaneous sip
go
yep that's pretty good
all right well let me look at my little
notes on my tiny little phone
because i can't print them out because
my printer
just isn't getting it done today
um yes i did restart it that didn't work
all right have you noticed that the news
is boring without trump
is there anybody who's noticed that yet
you know all trump has to do is dial
back
his own public efforts by you know 30
percent or whatever
and suddenly there's no news because the
news industry completely stopped
you know looking for actual news and
they just started reporting on whatever
trump said
and then insulting him and that was it
that was the whole thing
so all right there are enough people
telling me that i should
uh recycle my my printer
that i'm gonna do it but only to show
you that it doesn't work
okay hold it hold on right there
all right i'm back so i'm going to
recycle my printer if that doesn't work
maybe we'll throw it off the balcony
all right uh we'll
we'll let that reboot for a moment
um so
it looks like uh the united states is
getting money from mexico for the wall
not directly
my printer is making noise now not
directly but apparently we have some
kind of deal with mexico
that if somebody tries to
destroy the wall to get through it that
they will be
fined to pay for the repair and mexico
will collect that fine and give it to
the united states
and apparently that's actually happening
so if
a mexican wannabe illegal
migrant uh hurts the the wall
we get paid to fix the wall that's not
nothing
better than nothing but it's not mexico
paying for the wall of course
um other big story is the president
wants to draw down forces
in afghanistan and maybe other places
and
somebody says where'd i go oh
you saw me go off screen
and here's a little story that is good
context
for deciding whether the president or
the generals
and the pundits are the ones who are
right about
troop levels and here's my story
years ago i used to be a budget guy at a
big bank
and then the phone company and at the
phone company
my my job was to go to all the
individual departments
and say how much budget do you need for
next year
and then i would sum up all of their
detailed requests
and take it to the big boss so i summed
up all the individual budget requests
took him to the boss
and it was too much the budget was
higher than he could afford
so i thought that what would happen next
is he would look at each of the
individual department requests
and then each one individually he would
look at and say okay
they're asking for a little bit too much
or this one's a higher priority than
this one so we'll cut this one but we'll
we'll fund this one none of that
happened
instead the big boss looked at me and he
said
cut everybody's budget by 10
and i said well that doesn't make any
sense that would be completely
irrational
because all of these managers have done
detailed studies
to find out exactly what budget they
need to do the job that you've told them
they have to do
so you can't just cut it ten percent
because some people probably patted it
maybe some people didn't ask for enough
it's completely irrational to just cut
it 10
across the board and that so i made my
argument
that that didn't make sense and the big
boss looked at me and he said
just cut it all by 10 and watch
everybody make it work
so i did i cut everybody's budget by 10
and what do you think happened they made
it work
it didn't make any difference so a
hundred percent of the underlings
complained bitterly because
their their detailed budget was just
ignored
and they just said i just give them 10
less less than last year
that was it and it worked out
fine there wasn't a single problem
that happened because of that decision
now when trump says to his generals
you need to draw down these forces what
do the generals say
no way we've done a detailed study
and we can't possibly operate without
this many people we're at the bare
minimum in fact
you should be adding people not
subtracting people in afghanistan
and what does a good experienced
big boss say in that situation
when all of the experts all of them
every general every person who's fought
there every one of them says no you
can't cut those forces
cut it anyway cut it anyway
here we'll take care of you so you don't
have to suffer
problem solved um
so if you've if you've lived if you've
ever worked in a big company
you know that the president is the one
who's
playing the smart game with afghanistan
nobody knows how many people we need
there
but less at least is leadership
right at least if you say my goal is to
get rid of all of them
and i'm going to do it as fast as i
possibly can at least it's leadership
and i feel like the the generals etc
will make it work
so apparently he's he's going to draw
down some forces
and they will make it work amazon is
going into the
pharmacy pharmacy business which could
be a gigantic deal
because i feel as if amazon
should be your doctor i took some uh
blood tests and urine tests the other
day
so i got a full panel of you know
just generic blood tests now everything
everything's fine
so that's the good news it was nothing
to worry about but when i get the report
it's sent to me as the
as the patient and it goes to my little
online account i take out my app and i
look at it
and it's two pages of things that make
no sense to me as a consumer
because i don't know what these little
you know these various
figures mean now it does tell you if
you're if you're within the
field or not but it all but it doesn't
tell you
if you had too much of this or too
little of it what would it mean
because some of the values are sort of
you know toward the edge of the
of the the field now if they had made it
friendly
and simply said look here's your test
and you can read it
and if anything is confusing just click
on it and you can see a full description
of what maybe problems you might have if
this indication is too high or whatever
and it's completely useless the way it
is
now what is it that amazon does
amazingly well user interface
right the user interface for amazon is
just
crazy it's so good and apple does a good
job of that stuff too
so if you see amazon getting into the
the health business
the first thing you should say to
yourself is are they going to make it
simpler shouldn't i be able to get a
blood test
anytime i want because all they do is
draw blood and send it off
shouldn't i be able to get that myself
pay
twenty five dollars and just get one
anytime i want
and get results that i don't even need a
doctor to look at
that i can just read it say oh this one
says you should cut down on dessert and
maybe exercise more
because you're a little pre-diabetic i
could completely understand that if they
put it in english
but they put it in medical terms so i
can't anyway
so if the only thing that amazon did
is start turning the medical field
into something that has a good user
interface that you could actually
understand what you're looking at
that would be gigantic and would
certainly
help the competitive situation so
president trump fired the
homeland security cyber chief
christopher krebs
because krebs had announced publicly
that this was the most secure
election uh ever
and i guess if you're working for trump
at the moment
and you say the election is the most
secure one ever
um you're gonna get fired
so he got fired and
uh it's also being reported
that the election officials in each
state had been contacted i think by the
new york times
new york times contacted all the
election officials in each state
and said has there been any fraud or
problems this year
and every single state said
no problem so that's pretty good right
all the people who were in charge of the
elections in each of these states
have reported and i think we can believe
them that the people who were in charge
of the elections
did a great job according to
the people who were in charge of the
elections
and the new york times asked the people
who were in charge of the elections
if the people in charge of the elections
did a good job
and the people in charge of the election
said yes
the people in charge of the elections
did a great job
maybe the best one ever it's possible
that nobody's ever done a good job this
good
and the new york times printed that like
that was telling you something
that you needed to know
so here's a little experiment go into
any prison
and ask the prisoners if they're guilty
some will say yes
but you'll be amazed how many people in
prison will tell you that they're
innocent
and they must be innocent because you're
asking the person who knows
right i mean the person in prison they
have the most
information the most credible
information about whether they committed
the crime
because they were a direct witness to
whether they committed it or not
so just ask them and if they say they're
innocent well i think you have to free
them
because that that makes sense right you
ask the people
who would be incriminating themselves if
they answered one way
and you could trust that so when the guy
who's in charge of making sure that our
elections
are fair says that he did a terrific job
and it might be the best election
fairness you've ever had
fire that you should fire
that because he does not
get to say the election is great because
it was my job to make it great
so trust me and give me a big promotion
it just
doesn't work that way if there wasn't
somebody
auditing him you don't know
right because the last person you should
trust
is that guy he's the one person in the
whole country
that you shouldn't believe because if
you go to
any employee and say how'd you do
have you ever done an employee
performance review
did you ever have your employee come in
for an employee performance review
you say how'd you do and the employee
says you know
wasn't my best year i've had better
years
honestly i i feel like i didn't work
very hard and
everything i tried was a failure has
that ever happened
no nope and it never will happen
because if he asks people if they did a
good job
they're kind of going to say yes pretty
much every time
so we can't listen to any of the people
who were in charge
to ask them if they did a good job the
reason that you have a special
was a special counsel durham or whatever
looking into the
department of justice it's because you
can't ask the department of justice
if they did a good job because do you
know what they'll say
yeah yeah we did great
best year ever
so if you don't have a special counsel
or an audit
you don't have anything all right
so that was a good firing here's
something that
should have been in the news but instead
it came to be in a
in a dm on twitter and so i need you to
fact
check beyond this all right because i
should not be getting better information
from
people on twitter than i should be from
the professional news organizations
i don't think what i'm going to read is
correct
so you know don't put too much
uh faith in it until you see some fact
checking in the comments
but uh according to kyle
who who messaged me this morning um
he believes that he has seen in the news
so far four
errors out of georgia because they're
doing the recount there
and in the following counties he says
that the
the recount has uh had the following
changes floyd county 800 more votes to
trump
fayette 449 to trump walton
176 to trump and then
dekalb if this is true 9600
to trump now i need to fact check on
that
is it true that there are four different
counties with problems in georgia and
that the numbers i just
read are okay let me let me pause
i'll call it decab okay instead of
decalb
dekelb de cab is that the correct
pronunciation
do you think i care how they pronounce
their county
i don't if you put an extra
if you put an extra letter in the
spelling of your county
i'm going to pronounce it any
way i want and i'm going to pronounce it
with the l
get rid of the album if you don't want
me to pronounce it the wrong way
get the l out of there
anyway so are there four counties
and would the total of those four
counties be over 11
000 votes that have switched to trump
and that biden only won by 14 000
are my numbers right
so that would give you uh only another 3
000 that you would have to find that
switched
or that would be switched to uh trump to
put him over the top in georgia
are those numbers right
uh
okay i'm just looking at your answers so
give me a give me a fact check on that
because at the very least
why did the news not give me a summary
of these
these changes in georgia why do i have
to get it from a dm
right it's the craziest thing the news
is so defective that that this little
bit of summary which is the only thing
that puts any of it in context
because you don't know if georgia is
going well or poorly for the president
unless you see the summary
why do i have to get it from individual
on twitter and not the news i mean it's
just crazy
um
yeah so the 9600 were taken away from
biden but not
added to trump
um somebody says dekalb votes were only
switched in recount
which means what because i'm seeing
something about
the numbers that will be reported are
not the recount numbers but the original
and i don't even understand that story
why would you report the original
numbers if you're doing a recount
that doesn't make sense so most of the
news doesn't make
any damn sense does it i i swear that
all the context is left out of all the
stories
so you read the story and you can kind
of understand what it's saying
but it doesn't make any damn sense
because
everything's missing so how in the world
does it make sense
well change the topic
all right um about half of all
republicans according to a new poll
reuters
ipsos poll i don't know who who ipso
says
but about half of all republicans
believe that trump
uh won the election rightfully in terms
of
votes um and that voter fraud
is the only reason that joe biden won
now do you believe that do you believe
that half
of all republicans believe that the
election was
fraudulent half does that sound right
i don't know where they get half because
i don't know anybody who thinks it was
it was a fair election to you have you
met anybody who thinks the election was
fair
i i mean that literally i have not met
anybody who was a trump supporter i've
not met any who think that the election
was
um credible and fair have you
where do they where they come up with 50
of people who thought the election was
fair
now it's possible that it was i like to
say this
you know i like to drop that in every
now and then because if you don't keep
open the possibility
that all of the reports are just bs and
that
maybe it was just fine or maybe the
problems
are there but they're small it's
possible you can't rule out yet
can't rule out that either one of them
won
they're both possibilities at this point
all right
i'm seeing a horrible trend which is
uh the democrats are all talking about
prosecuting the trump family and they
don't even talk about for what
think about that there are multiple
stories
about uh about democrats saying yeah
when trump's out of office let's
prosecute him and prosecute the whole
family
and what they leave out of all those
stories
is for what
are you aware of any crimes that are
even alleged
against anybody in the the trump circle
now i know that there are
um there are some kinds of
investigations going on
but have we heard anything about any of
those that would tell you that there's
something out there
i've heard zero reports of anything that
would look like a crime
that the trump trump or any of the trump
members were involved in why are we
talking about it like it's a given
that there are some crimes out there and
if he's not president he'll be
prosecuted what crimes are you telling
me that
four years of looking for crimes and you
can't find any
but you're going to find him the minute
he's out of office
maybe i don't know
but it doesn't look like people
trying to find justice it doesn't have
that feel to it does it
it feels like hate and revenge
and that's all it just feels like hate
and revenge so the same impulse
that makes people want to hunt down
trump supporters and punish them for you
know their political
opinions it's it's just more of that
except directed at the trump family
so this this is the worst of humanity
here
apparently biden himself to his credit
is hesitant to want to prosecute trump
and he should be
because if you make that your standard
it's coming for you
if you're the president if you get
elected president the worst
thing you can do is go after the person
you beat
do not do that because if you go after
the person you beat
whoever replaces you is going to do the
same thing
the only thing that protects the
president after office
is that the president in office doesn't
want to be treated that way and
so you know maybe takes a little easy or
pardons or whatever they have to do
all right did you see the video of this
guy
ned stabler he's a democrat and i think
it's michigan
and he was on a zoom call that got
recorded and he's
threatening two other county officials
republicans i think
who didn't want to certify the vote now
it turns out that they
got talked into it or threatened into it
so they did certify it
but when you listen to this guy ned
stabler
and the hate that he has for his fellow
humans
it's not about policy at all
it doesn't seem to be about differences
of opinion
it just seems to be hate and so i say
again
we need to get some hate crimes on the
books
for trump's supporters meaning that if
you're targeted for being a trump
supporter
and let's say if you're being if you're
called a racist
just for being a trump supporter should
you be fired
from your job and or
prosecuted no i don't know if you could
be prosecuted for an insult
but let's say um could you be fired from
your job
for saying that a trump supporter let's
say a co-worker
is a racist because they're a trump
supporter with no other
no other evidence needed to make the
case
i feel like that's a hate crime and that
if your co-worker accused you of being a
racist
for supporting trump you should be fired
the the person making the accusation be
should be fired because how would that
be different than
a racist accusation it's all based on
it's basically just racism that's all it
is
so um
so as we're looking at what mattered in
this election
it turns out that calling for uh
defunding the police
while the news is showing non-stop
rioting on television
doesn't uh doesn't help your candidates
on the down ticket
so no big surprise that
most people like police
but i did see a story that said the
coronavirus wasn't that big of a
decision
do you think that's true do you think
that people's decision about
who they wanted for president didn't
have much to do with
coronavirus because i was feeling ahead
of the election i was feeling that might
be the case
and partly because the coronavirus
is going to sort of take care of itself
in other words whether trump's in office
or biden's in office you kind of know
where it's going to go
at this point right you know we're going
to have a really ugly winter and our
healthcare workers will be you know
stretched
to the max it doesn't matter if it's
biden doesn't matter if it's trump it's
our hospitals are going to be full this
winter there's
basically no way around it and we know
that the
vaccine is is promising and almost
certainly
by the you know say end of 2021
things should be looking good no matter
who the president
is so i have a feeling that when people
voted
and this is the way i would have
processed it i would have said to myself
you're not really voting for the past so
even
if you think trump should have handled
corona for iris differently
it's the past you can't go back
you can't go fix it you know joe biden
said that he would have handled the
crime bill
from the 90s he said he would have done
that differently
but he can't go back right he doesn't
have the option of going back
so you've got two people who both had
you know little
let's say some baggage according to
their critics
of something that happened before but if
those things are not likely to come up
again
and they don't seem representative of
you know who they are as leaders
you can kind of discount them a little
bit you can kind of say
i don't think we're going to have a
second pandemic and if we did we'd be
fairly ready for it i think you know we
had some practice
so probably people are saying some
version of
what do we need the president for for
the next four years
not the last four years and
on that basis you could probably say
coronavirus
isn't your number one thing that you're
voting on
whereas defunding the police definitely
is going to affect you in the next four
years if it happens
i saw a couple of studies about masks
so we we now have the definitive word on
masks we've been talking about it for
months and months
do masks work do they not work
and now we have two studies and finally
we can say
with certainty that one of the studies
says that mass
do work and the other one says they
don't
so trust science is what i say
trust science and science says
unambiguously that those masks
definitely work
and also also true
they definitely don't so science is
spoken
and i think unless you are a bunch of
bunch of unscientific flat earthers
you should believe science when it tells
you that masks
totally work and also
also at the same time totally don't
so it's both true listen to science
so both of those happen today
even jake tapper says that the the speed
with which the vaccines have been
created
is quote this is an unmitigated success
and we should acknowledge that said jake
tapper
which i agree
and appreciate i think you know as
as we move into the future i think
trump's uh warp speed thing here is
going to
start looking a little bit like a moon
shot and
and it might become the model that
people talk about
for how federal government can make you
know make the country do something that
even the country didn't think it could
do so
i have a feeling that's really going to
last the test of time
in terms of good leadership even if
other things
you know that he did do not sweden
is throwing us a curveball of course
little sweden was always fun to talk
about
because they did everything differently
they didn't do a severe
shutdown they took their lumps had a
high death count but then
the death count went down to practically
nothing and people said whoa
sweden smart little sweden you must have
done something right
your non-shutdown non-lockdown
maybe you got some kind of herd immunity
going we don't know what but it worked
whatever you did so
maybe we should be using this sweden
model oh
except update
sweden decided to lock down
so sweden is not going to be as locked
down as
maybe european countries or even even us
in a little in a few weeks i'm guessing
but sweden is getting tougher so they
they are putting
lots of limits on uh public gatherings
etc
now i think that they're still a little
looser than most places
but apparently sweden decided that they
don't want to be like sweden
so let me put it this way if you were in
the united states and you were an
american
and you said to yourself why can't we be
more like sweden
congratulations you're now just like
sweden
because they're doing what we're doing
so if sweden
was a big success story which many
americans were saying
can you explain that to sweden because
apparently sweden has not noticed
that their old plan was so successful
because they decided to
 can their old plan and do what
everybody else is doing
which is you know lock down and put
restrictions on etc
so if sweden doesn't think sweden
was doing it right should you
really i mean wouldn't you expect that
if anybody were going to take credit and
say yeah we did it right
it would be sweden and sweden doesn't
think they did it right or they wouldn't
have
you know completely changed their
strategy
um there was an article in time by
michael
mina i think i think he wrote it and
he's the one who always talks about
we could get on top of this uh pandemic
if we had rapid testing that was cheap
and people could do it at home
as much as they wanted we do have an
approval for
a relatively inexpensive
at-home test that you don't have to mail
it anywhere you can get a result pretty
quickly
but you need a prescription for it
it's like we can't do anything
completely right
the whole the whole point of these
at-home tests
is that you want to be able to do them
like you know popping a breath mint you
want to be able to take them anytime
anybody anytime just make it as
available as a pack of gum
and then you can and then it doesn't
matter that they're
a little bit less accurate than other
tests because you'd be doing so much
testing you'd get everything
pretty quickly so we could be done with
this by christmas
if we had these cheap tests the math
certainly indicates that now here's my
problem with
the biden administration future
potential administration we don't know
yet
and also the trump administration on
coronavirus
i've said before that there might be an
argument against
this method there might be some argument
that says no
this idea of using these super cheap
tests at home
won't get you what you think it will get
you but i haven't heard it
i've not heard anybody make the argument
in fact a hundred percent of the people
i've heard
talk about this idea fall into
one of two categories either they don't
understand it
or they think it's terrific there's
nobody who understands it
and also thinks it's a bad idea that
i've seen
you surely such people exist but i
haven't seen any
so here's my problem with both trump
administration
and whatever biden's planning
why are we hearing about this we should
at least be hearing why they don't want
to do it
or we should be hearing how soon they
can do it
or we should be hearing a lot of
conversation about it
but we're not it's like michael meena
writes an article or tweets
you know we we boost it i boost it and
then it just
sort of doesn't go anywhere now i know
that
the his his concept of the cheap testing
um which is different than just cheap
testing right it's
a specific kind of cheap testing the his
idea i know has gotten to the
task force so i know that they've looked
at it i know that they
have seen it i can i can say that for
sure
just personally where is their comment
on it
where is their timeline their response
something and the lack of that
i don't know i i can't see it as
competence
so uh to me it looks like the
the task force is dropping the ball
really big
on the rapid testing like really big
like really really big i would say that
um even if you give trump full credit
for the vaccines and of course we
probably should
the this falling down on this testing
stuff
i don't know i don't know how you
explain that like
can you give me any explanation that
doesn't make it look like
criminal incompetence because it looks
like criminal incompetence to me
even if it's not a good idea you should
at least tell us why it's not a good
idea
all right
shall we talk about the election i
believe you want to
so where's the kraken
in the comments somebody says that says
the kraken was lacking
yeah i think the cracking is lacking so
i told you that
you would see some of the good stuff
probably this week you know i did give
myself a little bit of a fudge i said
well it's probably this week
might be next week but i'm thinking it
was this week
have you seen anything that you would
consider
the good stuff i have not
not in the public so i've got some
questions
whether such good stuff exists and i
feel as if
i would give you this this guideline
it's the same same kind of thinking i
would use for
hydroxychloroquine remember i told you
that when we first heard good news about
hydroxychloroquine working i said well
so many people say it works even without
a good
controlled randomized study it seems
there's so much anecdotal
that it just makes sense to try it
because the the downside is
small risk and then i told you
that as we got into the spring and then
through the summer
that every day that went by that you
didn't get a confirmation that
hydroxychloroquine works
you should reduce your confidence that
it does
so i started out with i don't know it
looks like 75
chance you've got something here but
then time would go by and it wouldn't
wouldn't be validated you couldn't
couldn't quite
see it clearly happening in the real
world i'm like ah
50 50. uh
30 maybe 20 i would put it down to maybe
10
now every day that goes by
if they can't show it works it's
probably because it doesn't
probably likewise as you're watching all
of the
claims come out about the election on
day one
you know there's a bunch of claims and
you don't know they could be good they
could be bad
what estimate did i give you ahead of
time
you may remember that i said to beware
of all the individual
anecdotal claims of fraud because 95 of
them will not be true
at least 95 of them are not true
can you agree that my original estimate
that 95 of the claims would eventually
be debunked
doesn't it look like that's exactly
what's happening wouldn't you say
because i would say closer to maybe 100
now there are some things that are real
that are smaller
than what it would take to overthrow the
election so there are a bunch of real
things
i'm not saying there's no real stuff
it's just
we have not found real stuff big enough
to change the
election outcome have you seen any i
haven't seen any
in the public so today is sort of the
day
where you start with whatever your
percentage your number was
i think there's you know i would say i
would start with a uh
95 chance personal opinion
that the election was um stolen
by the end of today if i have not seen
the goods from either sydney powell or
giuliani or something my 95 certainty
is going to start to reduce so it'll be
lower tomorrow and then if we go yet
another day and i haven't seen any good
evidence
i'm going to lower it again that's a
good
model for you to keep in mind right at
about
today if you're not seeing some good
stuff
you have to wonder if it's going to come
right
you you can certainly say you know give
the people who are looking into
it a few weeks to to do the data they
need some time
so the first week or so that people are
looking into it doesn't mean anything
second week maybe that doesn't mean
anything either
but we're now at the point
where if we go too much further with
just claims without
a photograph or the witness who signed
an affidavit or something
i would just dismiss all of it pretty
much all of it
um
all right um
and the dominion software thing looks a
lot
messier than you thought because now
there are denials about
whether the smartmatics software was
ever
used with dominion
there's just there's now some credible
doubt about every part of the story from
top to bottom
here's one thing that i feel i can say
with certainty
the election was not secure
do you think we can say that with
certainty now you
you can certainly say it's not proven
that the election was stolen
but can't we say with certainty that it
wasn't secure
right does that seem fair
that even if you believe it wasn't
stolen it definitely wasn't secure
because just take one example the the
thumb drives that were found that
weren't uploaded
what kind of a crappy system would
allow you to get to this point in the
process without knowing that all of the
the precincts had even reported
really seriously how do you get this far
without knowing if you've even collected
the information
you know if there are like gaps in the
information you've collected
how do you get this far now obviously
if there had not been a recount and all
this stuff we wouldn't have even noticed
that a whole bunch of people voted it
was put on a flash drive and then
somebody stuck it in a desk drawer
somewhere or wherever the hell it was
and so all those people voted and their
vote was just completely
wasted because it just got put on a disk
drive and didn't go anywhere
so
the disk drive the stories alone tell
you that whoever put the system together
didn't have basic controls
because the most basic control is to
find out that the number of people who
voted
ended up in the total
that's pretty basic even if you know the
votes got changed or something
all right
i always get blamed for pacing and
leading you know
it looks like pacing and leading if you
just give a balanced
presentation so if you if you allow
that the other side has an argument and
you simply express it
at the same time you show the other
argument and make a decision it looks
like you're pacing
but sometimes it's just telling the
whole story
now i'm seeing people accuse rudy
giuliani
of making a tremendous amount of money
from working on the uh the campaign's
legal stuff
uh and some people are thinking that
he's just making up stuff and throwing
spaghetti against the wall that's the
phrase that the democrats are using
but do you think that you could get rudy
giuliani
lynn wood and sydney powell all
all top famous lawyers do you think that
they would all be willing to just
completely lie and make stuff up
it doesn't feel like that you know you
could imagine any one person doing that
no matter who it is you imagine anybody
lying
but that's a lot of liars how do you get
that many people willing to tell
whoppers of that size i mean how would
you ever live that down
if if you were sidney powell let's say
sydney powell
doesn't deliver anything now let's say
we never find any problem with the
software
or whatever in in the long run what what
does that do to her
credibility you know her future
future ability to get work it's kind of
a big hit
i don't feel like you would make a claim
like that
unless you were pretty pretty confident
that you had the goods so i feel like
they think there's something there
when do we get to see it all right
oh sydney just tweeted a link to
exhibits of evidence
well let's let's look at that right now
let's look at that link i'll bet without
looking at it
i'm just going to make a guess that
it will be something that i can't tell
is
real or not what do you what do you want
to bet
then i'll look at the evidence and i'll
say i don't know
could be real i can't tell by looking at
it
it's probably just gonna all right so
here it is
um no that's a freedom of speech thing
so it looks like what she retweeted was
evidence of
uh the big no should
she did not retweet evidence of fraud
um
yeah i would like to see the signature
verification
story do you think the software can
check
signatures because i think that's what
they're claiming right
the software is checking the signatures
or can
do you think he can i don't know
i feel as if i don't sign my name enough
the same way that
somebody could the software i could
necessarily tell if i signed it
um so michael yan is talking about a
civil war coming
i don't think you have to worry about a
civil war i just don't see that
happening
i think that um in order to have a civil
war
you have to have a lot of people who
want one and we don't have that
the the main requirement for a civil war
is missing
the main requirement somebody has to
want one
right have you met anybody who actually
wants a civil war
not really right if you talk to people
on the left and you said
all right you know you antifa people
what if
you could get your wish full out of
civil war
are you down how many people even in
antifa
would want a real civil war because
they're not going to win
so that's the first problem so i got a
feeling that the left
doesn't really want a civil war
and i know the right doesn't want it i
i've heard exactly
zero people talking in any kind of a
you know a positive way that a civil war
will fix everything
you you have to have somebody who's in
favor of it
it just can't happen without that right
we don't have leaders who are in favor
of it do it
can you name one leader on the left or
the right
who is in favor of a civil war none
none can you think of anybody
even at the you know the marching level
who will say out loud yes civil war
no no now you might get these like
non-violent color revolution things that
feel like a slow motion
civil war all the time but a shooting
war
no chance there's just no chance you
have to have at least
one person who wants a civil war we
don't have that
do we think about it think about the
fact that you've been convinced
that there might be a civil war and
nobody wants one
there's not going to be a civil war
there just won't be
well not even close it's not going to be
a near miss
it's not going to be a close call
there's going to be nothing
just the way i predicted that you know
even if trump
lost the election and certainly that's
the way it's being reported by the
the news um didn't you think
or not you but didn't people say it's
going to be civil war
you know it no matter what zero
conservatives showed any interest in the
civil war
did you see any of the militias activate
did any conservative militia
activate not that i know of
i don't think so so
uh so i wouldn't worry about the civil
war
all right
um
i'm just looking at the article that
just got sent to me
all right i don't think i have much else
and the proud boys
you know the proud boys are hard to talk
about
because you want to you want to
pigeonhole them and put them in a
category
but they just sort of defy categories
because you want to say oh it's a bunch
of racists but then you find out
it's a multi-ethnic group you're like
okay that didn't quite explain who they
are
and then you say it's uh they like to
fight
i think that's probably true they
probably like to fight that might be the
only thing that
that defines them um
yeah i've been having quite a quite a
bit of trouble breathing
in public with a mask on
uh like i does anybody get mask
breathing
panic does that happen to any of you
where
where you feel like a little uh twinge
of uh
panic basically that you can't breathe
just because you're wearing a mask
i get that every time i put a mask on
you know usually i can fight through it
but
it's not pleasant yeah i'm seeing some
others say yes
um what did you hear about the kraken
privately
well i can't tell you what i've seen
privately but i will tell you that
there's a data argument that i haven't
seen made yet
and i don't know if that's because the
people who are preparing it
have given it to the lawyers and we
haven't seen it or maybe they found out
it wasn't as strong as it
could have been i don't know the details
of that but i will tell you that there
is a strong argument that exists
that the public has not seen and every
day that you don't see that
you have to reduce your certainty that
it even exists
in other words i think i've seen it i
believe i've seen it with my own eyes
but you can't really look at a bunch of
data and know that it's accurate you
can't know that the context is right
you can't really know what you saw so
it's possible that
the things i've seen are not as
persuasive as they they should be all
right
um yeah and the other the other thing i
would say
about uh our experience with this
election
is there are so many opportunities
for mischief in an election i had no
idea
how many different ways that cheating
could happen so if it didn't happen it
would be
pretty amazing
somebody says yes uh oh yeah a lot of
people have that
mask panic now i have
asthma so anything that
reminds me of breathing difficulty
gets right into my lizard brain right
away so i can't process that
rationally because an inability to
breathe goes right to your
you know survival mechanism so it's
tough to be rational about that
all right so there's a claim that there
are places with more
votes than registered voters
i feel that that claim is
will be debunked if it hasn't been
because wouldn't that be the end of the
story
you know if you had seen data that there
are more
more votes than registered voters and it
was more than
let's say you know one county or
something that might have been a mistake
that would tell you a lot wouldn't that
be sort of the end of the game
if you knew that that were the case and
i've heard those stories
but yet i'm not seeing incredible
information on that
that that that's a widespread thing it
could be
um they may not advance a data argument
for the sake of the country
no uh the one thing i can tell you is
that the people
doing the data arguments will advance
them
so there's nobody on the data side
who's going to sit on anything for the
good of the country
because i don't think they think that
that's necessarily the good of the
country
yeah somebody said that uh code monkey z
is going to release
some evidence today so i think today's
the day
all right if you don't see some good
stuff today
i'd start worrying i'd start worrying
after today
certainly after tomorrow if we get to
the end of the week and you haven't seen
anything
i would reduce my odds that you will
ever see something
to 50
so i'm at 95 that the election was
stolen and we can
prove it if it's the end of the week and
i still
i still haven't seen it at least in
public i haven't seen it
i'm going to lower that to 50
but we got a few days we'll see
did scott strike out strike out on what
the link to the initial evidence is on
lynwood's
timeline all right i'll take a look at
that so somebody says
linwood has a link to it
do you have to be registered to vote
i don't know i mean i know there were
some places that let you register
and then vote so you could do same-day
registration in some places
uh so i don't know i i don't know if you
were not a citizen
could you vote in some places i just
don't know
the story about the german server is i
would say
highly unlikely to be true
if you were to rank all of the stories
we're hearing
in terms of well on you know on first
first look how likely are they to be
true
i would put at the top of my list of
fake news the german server
that would be number one as the least
likely thing to be true
the most likely thing to be true is any
small
story where one person voted and their
vote didn't get
counted or they find one flash drive
that wasn't loaded so
the small ones at least have a good
chance of being true
the big one like the the german server
i don't know
i think that one's pretty unlikely
somebody says they bet the german server
story is true i would take that bet
um am i being hunted yet
well i have been threatened at my home
um you know on by some stranger
and you know i'm continually
bullied online by people saying i will
pay
and karma's going to get me and you know
it'll all come back to me
etc so not not directly as in
i would have to act on it
somebody says no because they are not
checking this year checking what
registration
somebody says google proud boys and iran
if i google the proud boys and iran will
i find out that iran is funding the
proud boys
that doesn't seem likely to me
because the proud boys are primarily
patriots
so whatever that iran connection is that
is alleged there
uh that doesn't sound real to me
uh somebody says scott failed bigly on
election predictions
did i did i
um the the weird thing about this
election
is that you could guess or predict who
got elected incorrectly and still be the
best predictor
you know how that's possible right so in
my case
i predicted that the professional polls
the the ones that showed a big
difference were all fake
that's a pretty big prediction
isn't it that's a pretty bold prediction
that the
all that the main polls are just fake
that they're not even close was i right
that the polling was atrocious yeah
and that was a pretty bold prediction
now
that did get the election at least you
know close
so the people who thought that biden
would walk away from it
and even in the the battlefield states
they were very wrong so the people who
said that biden would win
but you win by this much were wrong
by this much if you're listening to this
on audio
i'm holding my hands at a certain
distance
now i guessed the president wrong
but in terms of how wrong i was i was
only wrong this much
because the the vote was close so even
though i
i guess the wrong winner in terms of the
first draft of the count
even though i got that wrong i was
pretty close
the people who got the right president
were off by a mile
because they thought the polls were
right in other words
van jones correctly thought that biden
would win
but he missed how much he would win by
by a mile
i thought trump would win
but you know it was kind of close close
election so i was actually closer
while being wrong which is very similar
to
what nate silver would say of 2016 which
is in the end the polls were actually
kind of close
so you could always make an argument
with the data that you weren't as
bad as you looked now i would also say
that it is my
personal belief as of wednesday that the
election was stolen
so if you say that i was wrong in my
prediction
i don't know that i was wrong now my
more current prediction
the the most recent one was that in this
coin flip
the the answer would be edge
i did a comic about this a long time ago
i think it was dog bird
or dilbert i can't remember they did a
coin flip and one of them guessed
it would land on its edge and any guess
correctly
i guess that this election would turn
into nobody won
or both of them won in other words they
would both be claimed as the president
that was a pretty bold prediction
has anybody ever predicted that the
winner of the presidential election
would be both
nobody ever predicted that before but i
did
and i think we're there to me it looks
like we have two presidents who both
have a claim
and and they're both pretty good
biden's claim of course is strong but i
think trump's claim is
pretty darn strong and might get
stronger so i
i'm still gonna go with history will
record that trump won
on votes but it might record that
biden took the job because the
you know the the media can just make
whatever reality it wants and it looks
like that's the reality they want
all right that's all i got for now and i
will somebody said how did trump win
again if the election was stolen
simple and i will talk to you tomorrow
all right periscope is gone any of you
youtubers have any questions for me
um
yeah so lori is agreeing with me that
history will record that they both won
um what did you hear about the kraken
privately well the things that i've i've
heard privately
are are data arguments so in other words
there there are alleged in number of
irregularities that really
couldn't be explained by anything by
fraud there just isn't any second
explanation for it
why am i giving youtubers special
treatment
don't you deserve it
trump's chance of a shadow presidency
well the scariest trump would be trump
in charge of a media entity
now think about the fact that cnn is for
sale
and trump might be looking to
own some media entity trump could
literally
buy cnn with you know investors etc
and he could fire all the cnn people he
doesn't like
and just use the network for his own
network and just turned it into a
conservative network which would be the
that would be the ultimate
revenge buying cnn and firing everybody
that didn't like him
uh i don't think that's don't think
that's going to happen by the way it
made more sense for him to just start
his own thing
um give you an example of the good
stuff well uh
i don't want to do that because i don't
want to
tell you more than i should but it's a
data argument let's put it that way
uh what if biden tries to take guns
civil war
then it just won't happen
because there there is not going to be a
situation where somebody knocks on your
door to take your gun
it's just not going to happen it would
be too dangerous
i could see a situation where he would
say you can't buy
you can't buy one that might happen
but it would also guarantee that
republicans
take the congress in 2022
so i think that whatever biden does
might be a short-term
situation because i feel as though
the writing is on the wall at this point
the republicans will take over the
congress in
2022 or 2024.
um
yes cindy you're right there will not be
somebody says you live in a gated
community i don't actually
i do not live in a gated community i
have a choice to live in a gated
community
but i don't like it because the gate is
such a gigantic pain and pain in the
butt
so i'm pretty secure here so i don't
need a gate
all right that's all i got for today and
i will talk to you
tomorrow
you
