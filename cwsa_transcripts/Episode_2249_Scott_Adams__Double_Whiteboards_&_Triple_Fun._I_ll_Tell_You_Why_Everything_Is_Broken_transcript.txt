good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you're lucky enough to be here for it
live in some cases and recorded in
others
now if you like your experience to go up
to levels that no one that has ever even
imagined were possible well all you need
for that is a cupboard glass a tanker
Charles has died of a canteen Joker
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dope immediate of the
day the thing that makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
oh yeah
yeah no it's not called real coffee with
Scott Adams it's only that on YouTube on
YouTube I had to put the reel in front
of it
because some bastard took my name before
I got there
bastard
so it's actually called coffee with
Scott Adams and I just had the reel on
YouTube
speaking of YouTube I asked a question
this morning I don't know if anybody's
noticed YouTube seems to have completely
changed
its experience for me and I wondered is
it just me in other words is glitching
like crazy and it won't allow you to
download and it's demonetizing and is
adding advertisements in where you don't
want them so basically it's like they
it's like the whole thing just blew up
Suddenly
so I'm trying to figure out have I been
targeted
because it looks like it
you know you have to suspect everything
at this point so it looks like I'm
targeted because in the same time that
my uh my followers on Twitter
went to a million you know started at
fifteen thousand and went to a million
during that same time
my traffic on YouTube
one from
zero to about 25 000 viewers and then
just stayed like that for five years
do you think that's natural
do you think that there's anybody on
YouTube who does a daily highly regarded
live stream that got no traffic increase
in five years
no that's not possible that's not even
slightly possible my even my number of
subscribers went up and the traffic
didn't go up
I should tell you something
all right
so I want to find out if that's just see
there there are two theories that are
pretty good one is that we have this
National incompetence crisis
and the other is maybe it's personal I
don't know
no way to know now
um
Rumble has its own
issues
which is I can't uh at the moment I
can't do live stream without going
through a third party software which
makes it
so impractical that I'm not using it
um
so enough about that
so uh here's a headline
um that's a it's a terrible headline so
something bad happened to somebody but
I'm going to test your ability to not
laugh at other people's misfortune
there's nothing funny about this
this is not funny
so whatever you do do not laugh at this
because you'd be a bastard if you did
uh the headline on Fox News has a woman
sues Disney for fifty thousand dollars
over injurious wedgie on water slide at
Typhoon Lagoon
and it turns out when you read the
article the injurious wedgie it was not
a backside wedgie
it was a front side wedgie
front side
and uh she was actually injured she had
a bleeding and uh
so she's suing Disney over a wedgie
front wedgie
everybody you better not be laughing at
this at home
take my role modeling here nothing funny
about that
moving on next story
well we all love the story of Jamal
Bowman representative Bowman
who claims he accidentally activated the
fire alarm actually pulled the fire
alarm in an attempt to open a locked
door because as you know the way you
open a locked door is to go to the
nearest fire alarm
read the directions and conclude that
maybe if you just pull the fire alarm a
little bit the door will open
now if if you had an employee who came
to you and said I'm sorry I was just
trying to open the door and I thought
that pulling the fire alarm was how you
do it
um would you have that employee drug
drug tested
I would yes I would have that employee
drug tested
now I would also look at the employees
of their behavior
did you confuse a lectern for a urinal
did you try to make a phone call on a
sandwich
set up a phone if you did any of those
things I would say hmm
possibility something going on so I
would like to uh throw into the mix the
most likely explanation
for how representative Bowman could do
something that you and I can't
understand what anybody can do
he was drunk
that's all
that's the whole story he was probably
drunk
now I have no evidence that he was
inebriated or that he was on any kind of
drugs I'm just saying I can't think of
another reason
because even even if you think oh it was
a clever plan he was trying to stop the
vote which I don't think is proven
right
to me it looks like it was a bad plan
whether he did it intentionally or
accidentally
in either case accidentally or
intentionally you wouldn't do those
things while you're sober
okay can we just be honest the most
likely explanation was he was drunk
at work
Am I Wrong tell me I'm wrong
I'm now I'm not accusing him of being
drunk
I'm saying that if you were presented
with this set of this set of facts
you're most likely explanation even if
it's wrong
the most likely explanation is that he
was drunk
if it were anybody else what would be
your most likely explanation
because nobody's that stupid
even if it was a clever plan nobody
would be so stupid as to think that plan
would work don't you think that he knows
that there is video security everywhere
I don't know I I the fact that we don't
even include that possibility in the
list of what happened
is that a blind spot
feels like a blind spot
if I had done well let me let me ask you
this if I had done that you know me as
the exact person I am you heard I was in
the capital
and I pulled the alarm and then my
explanation was that I thought it opened
a door
wouldn't you assume I was stoned
wouldn't you
I mean really
because you'd say to yourself well he
seems smart enough to do this stuff
and you say of a representative well
he's smart enough to get himself to
Congress but he's not smart enough to
know how to unlock a door
I don't know inconsistent
so I'm going to say let's put a drunk on
the list of possibilities but I don't
have any direct evidence of that it's
just the obvious thing you would check
well the Senate Banking Committee is
doing something that makes sense on the
surface so it must be a trick
right they're doing something that makes
sense on the surface
so obviously it's a trick
they're they're trying to make it legal
for banks to handle marijuana businesses
which at the moment Banks don't like to
do because it's
illegal
so so that sounds like progress right
it's just a good thing oh wow they're
trying to fix something that's broken
that the banks can't even handle a legal
business
that's good right do you think that's
why they're doing it
do you think this is why they're making
uh Banks able to handle your
transactions no it's so they can
track you has nothing to do with you as
a consumer or a citizen and so the
government can have more control over
you because right now if you pay cash
for your weed they're not sure you pay
you bought any weed
but I think they'd like to know and
they'd like to know your address and
everything else about you now so I see
this is just another
sign of basically
but it would be useful
um Trump's uh trial starts today on his
his mostly the issues about over
evaluating his properties they say
do you think that he won't win this
do you think that he can't make an
argument that his property is worth more
than the court thinks it's worth
I feel like he should win this one
except for you know not having a real
justice system
I don't know
so we'll keep an eye on that
um
you know
Zoe's got uh
it's amazing
the fact that overvaluing his business
in the context of bank loans and and
also Insurance the fact that the public
doesn't even understand that all that
works
the public actually believes that the
bank took his word for the value of his
properties
just just hold that in your mind the
story that we the public have been told
is that there are banks or maybe one
bank I don't know
that took his word
for like a gazillion dollars worth of
value they didn't do their own work
apparently they just took his word for
it that's what we're being told right
now we anybody who has even a little bit
of experience in business knows that's
not true yeah there's no chance there's
zero chance that they took his word for
it
now
what about the insurance companies
suppose he inflated the value of his
asset and then he went to get insurance
does the insurance company hate that no
they love that they love that
that's their ideal situation the ideal
situation is that the customer pays too
much for insurance and is happy about it
because that's what they think their
property is worth and then if their
property gets destroyed and you have to
replace it hahaha we replaced it for
half half of what you thought it was
worth so we win and we overcharge you
for insurance so he's gonna he might he
might be in legal trouble for making an
insurance company rich now I don't know
all the details so don't take my word
for the details but what the news has
told us doesn't make sense
there can be no situation where a bank
took somebody's word for the value of
their property
that's never happened
and there cannot be a situation where
overvaluing your assets is bad for the
insurance company
again that's not a thing
right the insurance company is going to
make sure that they're only reimbursing
you for the thing you lost not for your
opinion of its value
so how did we even get this far
that you know separate from the
questions of whether the lawsuit is
appropriate
the public is completely misinformed on
the news
the only reason that I know the news is
 is that I was a banker
and I have a big house that I had to get
insured
so I know how Insurance works
right so I know two things that the
public
you should know but probably doesn't
know as well
so maybe we'll learn something here
we'll see
all right um
according to Turley
there are a whole bunch of reasons why
at least four reasons why Biden could
get impeached
is that why your news is telling you
has your mainstream news said that there
are four reasonably likely impeachable
offenses
nope
do you think Jonathan Turley is
unqualified to say what is an
impeachable offense nope nope he's
totally qualified
totally qualified does Turley have a
long record of doing things which would
make him seem less credible
nope nope he has a long history of
calling balls and Strikes be they
Republican or Democrat very long history
of that
and he says there's four pretty obvious
impeachable things that would still have
to be demonstrated right not they're not
proven but the evidence we have strongly
suggests that if we got a hold of the
banking records
that's all you would need to connect it
all to the big guy so
hold that in your head for a while we'll
get to some other stuff
there's a study uh some
interdisciplinary research team at the
max blank Institute for empirical
Aesthetics
you know the mpiea
it's over in Frankfurt anyway they uh
collaborated with some people and came
up with
uh this shocking result
that dancing can make you happy
dancing can make you happy so if you're
in a bad mood
and somebody makes you dance the dancing
will make you happier
now
did you not already know that
is there somebody here who didn't know
that
well let me let me give you the reframe
all right
so my book reframed your brain which is
according to readers changing their
lives like crazy
uh here's the reframe
the usual frame the normal way we look
at it is that your mind
is contained in your brain
so that your skull is the limit to your
brain and your mind it's all in there
it's inside your head
the reframe which will change everything
for you is that your mind includes the
brain of course
but also includes your body
and all of its experiences and also
includes your physical surroundings
right if you don't see your mind as your
physical surroundings you won't know
what to do when your mind is not where
you want it to be
do you know what I do when my mind is
not right
I go for a nice long walk
and move my body
or I find my dog
and I curl up with her for five minutes
and you know get that little feeling
from the dog hugging
or
I do something else that makes my body
feel good eat some food you know the
rest
right now so when I think of my mind I
think of my entire environment because
those are the things I move to affect my
mind so it's like your environment is
the user interface for your mind
the people who are lost are the people
who say my mind is not right I'm unhappy
I'll try to fix it by thinking better
thoughts I can't I can't I can't fix my
mind with my mind oh no there's nothing
I can do I'd better go to a doctor and
get a pill
don't do that just understand that your
mind is your body and your physical
environment and that if you move your
physical environment just right and
dancing would be only one example you
can change your mind
how often do I do this exact thing
really often really often several times
a week I say to myself oh God my head is
not where I want it to be and what do I
do do I sit in the chair and think
different oh think different oh there we
go I got my mind all fixed no I do not
do that I immediately leave my
environment
get out of the room you have to get out
of the room
and you got to go somewhere else you got
to walk the dog you got to be under a
tree you got to breathe differently you
got to do something physical
uh everything else is a waste of time
so just remember that reframe
um I've been listening to a lot of
relationship advice on Instagram
which by the way is the very best place
to get advice
uh if you want to know how to handle the
most important things in your life
you should go to an Instagram influencer
not science no not science go to an
Instagram influencer
who has had two or three uh failed
marriages and
uh
and they will tell you what to do so so
you don't have to do it I already did
the the research and here's what I've
learned and I've I've sampled quite a
few relationship experts and so this is
just applies to heterosexual men
right this advice so I can't speak for
the lgbtq community at all but for
heterose hetero man this is the advice
that I've seen and it's very consistent
across all the experts which is how you
know it's right there are two things you
need to know as man number one
giving a woman whatever she wants will
make you look like a weak beta simp
and make her lose interest in you
sexually until she cheats on you with
somebody else
so that's number one
the last thing you can do say all of the
and by the way the the male and female
experts say the same thing it's not just
the men saying this the male and female
relationship experts say do not do not
give the woman everything she asked for
because then she'll just think you're
her servant and she'll lose interest in
you and go cheat on you
no but that's only one I mean you need
more than that
so number one is don't give a woman
whatever she wants number two
is you need to know that not giving a
woman whatever she wants will make her
go look for a guy who will so then
she'll cheat on you
so you got your two situations here
giving a woman what she wants Will Make
Her Like You lesson cheat on you and
giving her everything she wants or
giving her nothing she wants will make
her unhappy and go find the guy who will
and then I was told Scott Scott Scott
you have to find a happy medium
you have to find the balance
what exactly is the balance between
giving people what they want and giving
people nothing they want
is it giving them half of what they want
let's say that it's giving you is giving
women half of what they want
what would a woman do who got half of
what she wanted
if she's rational
I'm pretty sure she would look for
somebody who would give her everything
she wanted
and then she would cheat on you
because why why would she sell for half
why would she sell for 80
why would someone for 80 when you could
have a hundred percent
so according to the relationship experts
there are only two ways to go if you're
a man and both of them end in failure
and poverty
literally
I'm not even making this up
those are the only relationship advices
on Instagram is there two ways to go and
they're guaranteed to fail
I'm not making this up these are the
experts and the experts are never wrong
if anybody figures out well it would
work you should let me know
all right let's talk about Matt Gates
who's trying who's threatening to or
trying to uh yeah McCarthy out of his
speaker's job
and his big complaint is McCarthy had
made some promises early on and those
promises uh he says were not kept mostly
promises about putting funding bills in
one bill instead of collecting things
together
now a lot of people think that's a bad
idea including Thomas Massey
who tweeted or posted I fear that
attempting to vacate speaker McCarthy at
this juncture is a bad idea that will
lead to worse outcomes for conservatives
and then he he says signed the only
still serving co-author and co-sponsor
of the motion to vacate Speaker Boehner
so I guess sometime in the past
Thomas Massey had been
a big part of trying to uh get remove
speaker Boehner
so he is making sure you know that he's
not opposed to doing something that's
provocative and even he's in the
minority and even going hard against the
speaker so he's not he's not against it
in principle that's important to know
it's good context he's just saying in
this case it looks like it would make
for Worse outcomes
now as you know I love I love me some
Thomas Massey because he's unique in the
Congress and that he's very smart
and he's willing to look at evidence
which makes him totally unpredictable
you don't know which way he's going to
go because you don't know in advance
which way the data is going to go so
that makes it fun
right because he's honest and he goes
where the you know where where rational
thoughts should take you
and so he says you know probably would
get worse outcomes if you get real
speaker McCarthy
so what's the obvious
what's the obvious question to ask in
response
all right so here's somebody who has
credibility and says no trying to vacate
McCarthy would give you worse outcomes
what is the obvious question next
worse than what
worse than what
the current design is destruction of the
whole country
because we have a system that guarantees
we will overspend
and over borrow until we're dead
what's worse than that
can you describe me a situation that's
worse than that now I suppose
you know nothing improves and you still
spend yourself to death but you still
end up dead both ways right
so I don't think it's worse it might be
a lateral move but
is it worse I mean what does worse look
like what is worse than spending
ourselves into certain destruction while
we watch it happen
I can't think of anything worse what's
worse than having a Congress that
doesn't do anything about the Border
literally what is worse than that I
can't think of anything what is worse
than mindlessly funding Ukraine For What
appears to be not National interest
what's worse than that
I don't know
everything Congress is doing is already
the worst case it's the worst case
scenario
if you could take us away from the worst
case scenario then I would say no don't
break it let me tell you how Engineers
think now I'm not an engineer but I've
spent so much time with him and writing
them out of my I could pick up some of
their vibe
here's now an engineer thanks number one
uh if it ain't broken
don't try to fix it
right if it's not broken don't try to
fix it
number two
if it is broken
and you can't figure out how to fix it
what do you do
if it is broken
and you don't know how to fix that what
do you do
you're an engineer what do you do
no scrapping it would just make you
build it back again probably
you break it
you break it more yeah if something's
broken and you don't know how to fix it
you break it more
because that's one way to get you to a
different starting point it could be
that the reason you can't fix it is that
there's too much inertia
yeah there's too much uh you know
built-in resistance so you might have to
Nuke it
so if if what if what Gates is doing
sends Congress into chaos
and and just completely breaks it
is that worse
give me an argument that that's worse
because what would happen if Congress
completely dissolved like they just
couldn't do anything
then they would have to fix it wouldn't
they
wouldn't they then have to fix it but
then they'd be starting from a different
starting point they wouldn't be starting
from well we have this Cathedral and
we're not going to tear down the whole
Cathedral just to fix these things so I
guess there's nothing we could do we'll
just march on to destruction now
bomb the cathedral
bulldoze the cathedral and then see what
you got to work with
right so if it's broken then you can't
fix it you got to break the out of
it some more you've got to further break
it you got to really really break it
then you might have a way to go forward
but if you don't break it you're on a
design
cruise to destruction the design will
destroy you you have to change the
design
and that means breaking so I'm fully in
charge of Chaos
and complete destruction we do not have
a congress system which is worth
maintaining now I'm saying keep all the
same people for the most part but
they're going to have to operate
differently they're either going to have
to show their work
you know show that they've got single
issues that they're voting on or
something
something but whatever they're doing now
is not working so break it just break
break it all
and that would be rational now if uh I
haven't seen if uh Thomas Massey has
responded sometimes he does respond
um he may have a good argument if he has
a good argument I'm totally going to
listen to it why because he's credible
he earned it right the reason that I
would take my time to listen to Thomas
Massey whereas I might not bother with
somebody else
is that he's going to say something
sensible so I will listen to that
and maybe change my mind
well governor huckle she's governor of
New York right
how old is Governor of New York yeah and
Bill Clinton or in agreement about
something they both want New York City
to stop being a sanctuary City
do you know why
because there's too many immigrants
now
or are governor hokel and Bill Clinton
saying that the immigrants are worse
than the people who already live here
do they have bad genetics is that what
they're saying is that what the governor
in Bill Clinton no no no it has nothing
to do with the the genes or the race of
the people right so that's not part of
the conversation has nothing to do with
their genders
that's not part of the conversation
it's purely the situation it's a design
problem
if you take a bunch of people who are
doing well you know the people who lived
in New York for in the first place
and then you introduce a large
population of people who are not doing
well
the the natural outcome is that the
people doing well are gonna have to you
know stop doing well and they're not
going to be able to walk down the
streets safely
um and they will have to give their
money and give up other things that that
money would have done for them
so
when uh Bill Clinton and Governor hulkel
say that New York City should stop being
a sanctuary City because it's attracting
too many immigrants are they being
racist
are they being racist no
no they are not because first of all
it's all kinds of different races right
it's a bunch of different people from
different places it's not all Central
South American a lot of it is African
and Eastern European and Chinese Etc so
it's not racist
but if you were to summarize
what governor hulkel and Bill Clinton
are saying about the immigrants what
would be a a folksier more casual way to
say you should stop being a sanctuary
City
like what words if you were let's say if
you're a crude and provocative
what would be another way to State it
get the away
right right so basically they're saying
that the people in New York City need to
get the away from the immigrants
but it has nothing to do with the
quality of their character the
immigrants
has nothing to do with their genes or
chemists their chromosomes has nothing
to do with their gender it's not based
on bigotry it's system design
it's just system design if you put the
wrong people in the wrong place you get
a bad outcome
right
am I right it has nothing to do with
anybody's quality of a human being has
nothing to do with anybody's worth
has nothing to do with your worth as a
person
in fact I think I would guess that the
Immigrant population coming in now
this is just a guess
is the highest quality of immigrants
we've ever had
I know you don't want to believe that
my opinion is it's probably the highest
level of quality here's why
if you can get all the way from Europe
you know through Central America you've
got enough money to do that you have
enough ambition to do that
and you're the type of person who could
even conceive of this working and you
can pull something together in your
Homeland you've already demonstrated a
whole bunch of qualities I like
right if you didn't know anything else
about them you'd say hmm I could work
with this
I could work with this have you ever
tried to hire a Native American lately
native as in not not uh not original
Americans but somebody who was born here
try try to give somebody who was born
here all their life to come do some work
for you
not so easy
try to try to get a recent immigrant to
do some work for you yes
you can get a recent immigrant to do
almost any kind of work and be delighted
and really put in the effort
I mean that's the kind of people who are
coming here so I want you to know from
my perspective although we don't know
for sure because we don't really know
the composition of them we assume that
more criminals are coming through would
you agree
more terrorists absolutely definitely
more terrorists definitely more
criminals but on average if you were not
counting the criminal Elements which are
certainly part of it on average I'll bet
we're getting a higher level higher
quality of immigrants than we have ever
gotten before because we have a bigger
filter
like it's really really expensive
to pay the pay the cartels and it's
really really dangerous which means you
get all the Risk Takers
I I want Risk Takers who can figure out
how to get out of the hell hole they
came from and to get into America it's
like your perfect test it's the perfect
test
now this is not my ideal situation
all right my ideal situation is totally
controlled immigration in which we get
to pick
you know our our favorite people the
people will add the most but we don't
have that
Sons of Liberty we're going to delete
you for saying the same thing 50
times in a row
goodbye
and we'll get rid of everybody else who
says that
ngos ngos ngos all right we don't need
you anymore
so
would you say yes or no
that the Kathy hokel the governor hokel
and ex-president Bill Clinton are saying
the same thing that I said it was
it was not about anybody's culture
any differences among people at all it
was a system design problem
that if you if you take half of the
population and teach them that the other
half have their and you should go
get it
thus that has been taught you know if
you're in the half that has their
you should get out of there
get away so you don't want to be where
somebody thinks
that you have their shift here's a
simple example
suppose your state was getting really
serious about reparations
and you were literally going to be taxed
just for being in that state
does that say that somebody has bad
genes no has nothing to do with any
individual
it's a system that's bad for you so you
should get the out of there
so if you could move to a state that is
not considering taxing you specifically
for reparations you should go there
now does that have anything to do with
anybody's genes no that's a system
design
so you you can go where the system
design works in your favor and anybody
who stays where the system design is
clearly designed
to make them suffer at the for the
benefit of others you should get the
 out of there if you can now
realistically there's no place to go
so if there were some place to go that
would be serious but it's hyperbole
because
where would you go
all right so in the limited case maybe
you could change States or something but
people don't really do that
all right
um
there's a story that says that the Mark
Zuckerberg and his wife sold their San
Francisco home
so they've had it for a while 31 million
dollars they got for it now why do you
think Zuckerberg would sell a home in
San Francisco
what what would cause him to not want a
home in San Francisco where he used to
he used to like having a home in San
Francisco
could it be
that he spent hundreds of millions of
dollars of his own money
to guarantee that Democrats got elected
so that they could put in place a system
that he can't survive
because that's what it looks like it
looks like he said shoot this place has
gone to hell because of the people I
helped get elected and so I've got to
get the out of here
now did Zuckerberg make any statements
or do you believe in his mind he's
thinking oh they moved in a bunch of
people to my neighborhood who have bad
genes or bad character
no no it's the system
San Francisco have a system that used to
keep it clean and inviting and people
came there and then thanks to people
like Zuckerberg who got Democrats in in
place in Soros Etc there there's now a
new system
in which the smartest thing that he can
do is get the out of there so he
sold his house
how much more right do I need to be
do you remember the coverage of my of my
cancellation
do you remember how many of the stories
wrote that what I was complaining about
was a system
as opposed to some of these genes
do you remember all those stories you
never saw one
you know why you never saw one
the only only place you've seen it is
where I've been in podcasts and and I
explained it the reason you've never
seen that story
nobody ever asked
I was canceled worldwide
by my syndication all the newspapers and
my publisher
they never asked why
they never asked what was on my mind why
I said it what was the context never
asked
oh you're so broken
goodbye
all right
Sam Beckman freed apparently according
to Michael Lewis who's writing a book on
him I had considered seriously offering
Donald Trump a large amount of money to
not run in 2024.
now he got popped before he could
execute that but the allegedly somebody
gave him a number of five billion
dollars and so the speculation is that
Trump himself may be behind that
estimate do you think that Trump would
have taken five billion dollars in
crypto
to not run
I don't really see it
I don't see it
yeah
so uh but do you think do you think
there's somebody who is in the Trump
organization may have floated their own
number which was their own best guess of
what it might take to talk him into it
easily
you know if you'd asked me I could have
given you a number
you should have asked me I'm good at
estimating I'll give you a number you
know what my number would have been if
you would ask me what do you think is
the number
do you know a number I would have given
you
just guess guess what number I would
have given you as Trump's price to leave
well I'll tell you
5 billion that would have been my exact
guess
do you know why
because three or four billion are not
round numbers they seem
you know it's just weird and Trump was
probably already worth somewhere in that
low billion dollar number
so getting a billion might not change
his life
getting 5 billion that might change his
life
you know you buy entire new businesses
he could start a media Empire if he
wanted you could do a lot of stuff he
could run the country sort of without
being an elected official you know sort
of like a Soros type or a
um
Murdoch type
or a Bezos type to own a major
publication
so you could imagine that Trump
you know might have at least considered
5 billion but it's the same number I
would have come up with
because over five seems like unnecessary
like if five doesn't get it done
I don't see how sex would
right so 5 is enough to matter it would
be enough to give him a new set of power
you know they could buy entities
but I doubt he was ever involved in that
conversation it seems unlikely that
anybody would have taken that to Trump
because I think you would have
I mean I I don't know
like he's not violent but he might have
punched somebody if they said that
anyway
um well we got a new senator in
California governor Newsom is appointing
the replacement for Dianne Feinstein who
passed away
and let's see if there's any surprises
involved here
he
okay put into job a uh a black lesbian
one yeah black lesbian
so
um
I'm starting to think I never had a
chance for that job
I mean
I'm seeing subtle signs that if I tried
really hard to get that job
now that I'm a Democrat
um I feel like I don't know I just feel
like maybe the deck was a little stacked
against me in some ways
yeah you could say it's the fifth career
that I've lost because of being the
white guy
once again I cannot be a senator
couldn't work at the bank because I was
a white guy I couldn't work at the phone
company because I was a white male they
told me that directly by the way that I
could never be promoted at those places
my TV show didn't work because I wasn't
black
and I had to be black to be on Monday
night on UPN
and then I got canceled
for saying something about the system
that had nothing to do with anybody's
genes or race
so
now it's the fifth time in a row I've
been blocked
by my white maleness
could not be a senator in California
but I'm sure she's great and the reason
I'm sure she's great is that she's a
woman a lesbian and black
those are three of the greatest things
I've ever heard of in my life
can we all agree on that
there's nothing better
than being any one of those things but
if you've got three of things you're a
woman you're a lesbian and you're black
well that's who I want for my senator
because one way to know you get good
quality
is to artificially restrict your choice
to the smallest pool of applicants
because that's the way you get the best
the best people
all your best entrepreneurs do that
you've probably seen the eclipse of
Steve Jobs say when I hire people I
don't like to talk to more than two
I'm sure he said that right
because otherwise it's like we'd be
acting stupid or something
but I'm sure he said that probably
something like that
all right
she's been a fierce advocate for working
people
excellent uh you know what the good news
is
I'll tell you the good news she has
Smart Eyes
do you think that's a thing
I I really think that's the thing ah the
Smart Eyes
I just look at the picture of
uh let me get her name right
uh lufonza Butler
so you know I looked at a number of
pictures of her and you look at her face
and you say to yourself
wow she looks smart
everybody's agreeing
all of the comments are the same yeah
she has Smart Eyes that does mean
something
it does mean something I mean you could
really tell if she has an animated sort
of smart face
all right
um
Joe Biden recently said in some
interview uh
that he was worried about the x-platform
and musk's ownership and he said and I
quote they they they
that's the first part of the quote
they they they they they they
go online they go and you have no notion
whether it's true or not he said
so
um
there it is directly
Joe Biden doesn't want you to see what
people say on x
because it's not his truth
because I don't think Biden thinks that
he knows the truth in a way that's like
you and I don't know
is that the claim yes some special
access to truth so he can look at acts
and he knows what's true
because of his Superior
you know I don't know access to
information
no it is the government directly telling
you they want to censor you
and it couldn't be more direct than than
the president of the United States
trying to discourage people from using a
platform
or the ADL which is part of the Democrat
machine trying to destroy it before it
was even paid for
yeah that's purely an attack and Free
Speech there's no other way to put that
so that's why all the investigations
into Elon are happening now do you know
who's not being investigated let's see
Elon Musk has a whole bunch of
Investigations that all sound like
 to us and none of them sound
even vaguely
like real crimes or anything
but uh
are there also a lot of Investigations
into George Soros
does anybody remember that a lot of a
lot of George Soros investigations I
don't remember any
let me ask you this
do you think that the intelligence
apparati of the United States would
allow any billionaire
to have an unusual level of control over
the country
do you think that would let that happen
well they're not they're not letting it
happen with Elon Musk
is Elon Musk doing whatever he wants no
he's he's being blocked by forces that
we assume are part of the deep state
so but sorrow seems to be operating uh
with impunity even though he seems to be
funding things that would lead to the
certain destruction of the United States
such as lawlessness and you know no cash
bail and stuff so why would this one guy
be able to do things that even on the
surface look like they're designed to
destroy the country
and yet musk who everything he's doing
is clearly designed to help the country
more free speech you know get humans to
become space-faring civilization
electric cars for climate change and
he's the one big investigative why
because he has a lot of power
so do you think that some other person
who has a lot of power would be allowed
to operate
just by his own whims
that's kind of impossible
in the world as as we know it that sort
of doesn't happen
so one has to assume that Soros is just
a a tool of the government or at least a
tool of the Democrat government
so I don't see him as separate from the
elect officials I think they just use
his and maybe the Intel people do
intelligence people do it looks like
they just use them as a piggy bank and
in return he gets
everything he wants that's what it looks
like now there's no way to know
but I see no situation in which the
intelligence apparatus of a country
would not have total control over an
individual
or let me let me ask this a different
way if the intelligence apparati of the
United States wanted to control Soros
could they do it
remember he's a citizen
so they'd have physical control as well
as he's a citizen
of course they could
that our intelligence people could
control any individual would you agree
with that statement you know unless that
individual
I don't know decides to off themselves
or something they could blackmail or
bribe
anybody because there's no limit to what
they would do that's bad and no limit to
what they could do for you that's good
and so they have unlimited tools of
course they can
so the only logical conclusion is that
Soros is part of our intelligence
operations or at least compatible with
them
what else could it be
which also tells you that whatever else
he's doing
is either being tolerated
because it's you know not the top
priority or
we want it to happen
who exactly wants to destroy our cities
I can only come up with one hypothesis
that makes sense
so I can come up with one hypothesis
where if you really
twist it and play with it a little bit
you can make it make sense it goes like
this
let's say Soros is genuinely concerned
about
um the distribution of wealth and that
rich people have too much and he wants
to poor people in more now that would be
consistent with the fact that he's
giving away a lot of his money
so he seems to be sending his money
toward other people partly self-defense
I'm sure but
what what would the possible plan or
benefit be to destroy the cities of the
United States with unlimited immigration
what would be the end state of that
here's the only one I can think of
we would fix immigration
because you realize
that all of our problems is because our
own system for immigration is totally
broken
so at the very least you would fix
immigration
at the but you also might have to fix
your neighbors
in other words we might have to invest
in countries that aren't doing well
to get them to stay home
maybe that's what he wants more
investment in
in countries where they're so desperate
they have to leave
maybe that's the best I can come up with
and I would argue that it would look
like the Matt Gates approach where I
said Congress is broken so you should
break it further
because you can't fix it from where it
is it could be the Soros has tried to
break cities just break them and make
them non-functional
because once once you break the country
well then you have more options and one
of those options might be way more
immigration
but controlled
I actually think we would be better off
with way more immigration
controlled
do you agree with that could we increase
the numbers if we also increase the
vetting and made sure that we have some
control
some say no so I think it depends what
you think about our birth rate
if you think our native birth rate will
keep up
then you can make an argument for
restricting immigration if you think it
will not which is what I think it will
not then the only way you can become a
viable country in the longboard and
broadness through immigration
because there are no other people here's
the fact that you need to know about
economics
economics is population
there's your reframe
economics
is people
right the reason that India and China
are world powers
is not because each person makes a lot
of money
you get that right there's not a lot of
Rich Chinese people and Rich Indians as
a percentage of the population
it's only because there are so many of
them if you take you know a billion
middle class Chinese they can pay more
taxes than America that has maybe more
rich people
so power is people
so if you say if you say I want to stay
at a superpower but I want to keep my
population low
or not growing too quickly you can't
have both of those
those are incompatible
people equals economics that's it
now you want to do it right and have
them trained and get the right people at
the right rate but people people are
money that's it
all right so chew on that I can see some
of you not too delighted with it
all right um
here's a dog not barking
if you had to say the the one thing
that's a problem that's causing our
immigration crisis
what would be the one thing that's the
problem this the single root cause of
immigration go
and watch how wrong you are
damn it somebody you were right
incentives
Democrats women
yeah it's amnesty so we have an amnesty
law that was designed for one purpose
but is being wildly abused for a
different purpose which is illegal
immigration
now which members of Congress have
introduced the new uh amnesty laws
okay can you give me the name the names
of the politicians
who have proposed a solution which is to
fix the amnesty laws
what what nobody
nobody
so a hundred percent of us agree
that this wouldn't be happening except
for the amnesty law
and that's not being debated
am I right
somebody said Scott weiner was doing
something
that's a real person it's not I'm not
making fun of myself
but can you explain that
yeah explicit oh Asylum I'm sorry am I
using the amnesty instead of asylum
I should say Asylum right which is the
right word Asylum
all right correct correct and correct my
language for the last five minutes to
Asylum Asylum Asylum Asylum all right
Asylum
so who's working on changing the Asylum
laws
which which both Democrats and
Republicans agree
are being abused
is it in the news
is the news covering that somebody is
trying to get that changed
there's something completely missing in
the story
right it doesn't matter if a candidate
is talking about it because they can't
make laws
so Congress is completely uninvolved in
changing the only thing that would
matter
is that right
and you're not seeing this on the news
right if I hadn't mentioned this would
it be at the top of your head that
there's a simple effects you just change
that one law
or you could just suspend it you could
just suspend it and say it's not working
at the moment maybe someday later we'll
we'll reintroduce it
just suspend it
you don't think a president could just
suspend it with that executive order I
do
I believe that a president could suspend
it with an executive order because the
president is the commander-in-chief
so if this law was being used to make us
less safe
and Military age people and terrorists
and stuff are coming across the border
yeah executive order
commander-in-chief shut it down but
don't make it go away forever
just say at the moment
this is too big of a risk so it's
suspended until later
well here's here's my take
obviously the media is not legitimate
because they would be reporting oh it's
a simple fix and here are the people
working on it so maybe you should give
them some support
but instead we just show pictures of
people screaming across the border and
then talk about Sanctuary cities where
we are thinking so past the sale
that were in the world where there are
no Solutions
the solution was the part we ran past as
fast as we could back up to the part
that caused it
the Asylum law change it or suspend it
and then you don't have to worry about
too many people in New York City and
whether you should be a sanctuary City
it would just go away
so there's some kind of force at work
that we don't understand or is very evil
because everything tells us that this is
the easiest problem we have can you
think of any other problem that could be
solved with a pen
I can't
that they could just sign a little piece
of paper uh and the Asylum laws boom and
problem solved
so yeah there's something going on and
it's not good
all right uh let's talk about uh garbage
science you know
um
okay
uh this is gonna we're gonna go to the
white boards now
so I'd like to explain to you why
science is broken
and why everything else is broken too
you ready it's a two-parter
here's what you need to know about
science
that cannot be told to you by the media
because the media is in on it
they're colluders
and it looks like this
simple graph
goes like this so money involved in the
in the topic that's on the left and then
level of corruption is on the bottom
and it's very easy to understand if
there's no money involved and it's just
pure science
there's probably not much corruption
so you could trust uh when there's no
money involved probably not much
corruption because
you can't make any money
but as you go up the money scale
you get to the things like climate
change and covid
if money works the way it always works
everywhere else
over time you're guaranteed that none of
this is true
why because criminals will always try to
game every system
and eventually it will only be criminals
because the money is good
so it's not going to pay to do things
that are just true
when you could do things that are not
true and get a big paycheck
so over time
if there's a lot of money involved in
the topic like climate and covet what
should happen predictably
by the design of the system
not by accident
by the design of the system
you guarantee that your most important
questions are all fraudulent
there's no other way this could work
there's no other way it can go
it's not like oh maybe this could lead
to something bad
no it can only lead one way there's not
a second thing that could happen
it will always always always Trend
toward fraud
always it has to because that's where
the money is now you might say to
yourself but Scott you know there are
some criminals
but mostly there's honest people so
wouldn't the honest people sort of crowd
out the the criminals you know would the
Criminal part always be smallish
necessarily
no the Criminal part is guaranteed to be
the controlling part
here's why
and it's just math
it's just math there's no opinion here
at all pure math
let's say you started with some kind of
a system
that was completely legitimate when you
started it could be anything it could be
the the system of science you know the
whole scientific Community everything it
could be the Republic
that's a system it could be your voting
system so it could be systems within the
larger systems
if you started with these all being
completely legit on day one
and then you wait what's going to happen
because all of these things have a lot
of money involved really big Stakes like
the biggest money of all billions and
billions of dollars you know big money
you can assume there will be infinite
criminal attempts
to get some of that money and
subvert your intentions
now let's say somebody tries but they've
only got a five percent chance of
success boom it didn't work
so everything's good because some people
tried but there was a 95 chance they
would fail good we're all good
tomorrow comes somebody else tries 95
chance they fail they failed again
day three failed to get them day four
failed again failed again failed again
failed again yes what a great
oh
what happens if you keep going
eventually
somebody's going to succeed
and then they're going to get ensconced
and then more people will succeed over
time
there is no way
you can avoid all of our systems being
corrupt eventually
because they can be corrupted it's just
unlikely most of the time you get caught
but only a few people have to get
through the system and succeed
five percent would be plenty
to guarantee guarantee that eventually
all of these systems are corrupt
this is our current design
our current design
guarantees corruption do you know it
would be something that worked against
corruption
term limits
term limits the just about the only
thing you can do to make people not
steal from you is to not keep them
around for long
right how could you fix the election
system
if you believe the election system is
not fair
what's the only thing you could do to
fix it
fire a hundred percent of the people who
work on it every year
and then next year a whole other group
of people
then maybe you could you know find out
if somebody was doing something because
the good people would get fired like the
people who are good at cheating
might be replaced by somebody who's not
as good at it and then they get caught
so pretty much the only thing you can
ever do
to assist them as people and money in it
is you've got to eliminate all the
people now and then
do you know why we don't have term
limits in Congress
now you do
now you do because if you had term
limits you could not stay in congress
long enough to be uh Bob Menendez
Menendez the guy who's you know accused
of taking bribes as head of the foreign
intelligence committee
the reason that he was in a position to
take bribes is he was there for a very
long time
and eventually got to the place where he
could get away with and so he did
if you've got somebody who's been in
Congress for a long time and then you
put them in the job that is the most
easy to get bribes what do you expect to
happen
what would happen every time
when Biden was there looks like it was
about the same
so if the design of your system
is that you're going to keep the same
people in place for a long time they're
just going to chip away at things until
they find a way to steal all your money
by Design
so don't think that we have bad people
we also have that
but the design is guaranteed to make
everything corrupt including science
including science
the correct the design of science at the
moment is that
the only way you can get a you know get
ahead is to say things that agree with
the narrative
and are in a big topic
so it's going to be your you created a
system that guarantees a whole bunch of
people who say climate change is real
and then they compete to say how bad it
is
whoever can say it's the worst gets the
most money if they can make a case worth
so why are things broken
they were designed to break
if you designed things to break
don't be surprised when they break
right
so that's happening
um
do you remember the study I talked about
it yesterday and a lot of you have heard
about it so um Nate silver was talking
about about the fact that there was some
big study that showed that the people in
red states were dying at a higher rate
than the blue States after the
vaccination came out
so knee silver as I've said a number of
times is one of your you know most
qualified people for looking at data and
evaluating it you want to hear the
Counterpoint to Nate Silver's take that
the data shows that as soon as the
vaccinations came out the red states did
worse
that that difference started before the
vaccinations came out
and it's in the data
if you dig into the data
you can see that the difference started
long before
the vaccinations came out
are we done
are we done
that's all you need to know right
there's nothing else you need to know if
the difference happened before the
vaccinations it wasn't the vaccinations
now this comes to us in the Wall Street
Journal from Alicia Finley
um
so I'll just read her words
a July study in the Journal of American
Medical Association now remember the
Journal of American Medical Association
is one of the respected ones right
that's one of the biggies
so the study that was in that purported
to find a higher rate of excess deaths
among Republican voters in Florida and
Ohio after vaccines have been rolled out
differences in partisan vaccinations
attitude the study concluded may have
contributed to the severity and
trajectory of the pandemic all right now
here's the Counterpoint
but the study lacked information on
individuals vaccination and cause of
death
wait it's a study about vaccination
status
and cause of death
but what it lacked was information on
your vaccination status
and cause of death
I'm starting to smell a problem with
this
we'll go on it also didn't adjust for
confounding variables such as underlying
health conditions and behaviors
apparently the age the Age part was not
the biggest problem as others have
pointed out charts buried in the study's
appendix showed excess deaths among
older Republicans started to exceed
Democrats in mid-2020
well before vaccines were available
is there anything else I need to tell
you
about how science is done
here was here with science at which
their own data that they published
disagreed with their own interpretation
and not just a little bit
not just a little bit it was opposite
it was opposite and that and not only
did that opposite get through the peer
reviewers
it got through the peer reviewers but it
got all the way to probably a day silver
I'm not sure if he was looking at this
one or not might have been some other
data he was looking at but certainly
other qualified smart people
looked at it and said well that looks
good because how many people are going
to dig into the appendix
and and see if see what's going on there
probably not many
and now if I got a second opinion from
the study authors would they agree with
what Alicia
Finley says about him probably not they
would have their own argument about why
maybe something made sense and you don't
think it does maybe I don't know
but
we don't have a science that works when
money is involved would you agree
that if money is involved science just
breaks
just breaks instantly it's like it's
like glass
you know science is like steel when no
money is involved because then just the
truth matters
but as soon as money is involved it's
glass
can't can't trust it at all
all right
well ladies and gentlemen
now that I've proven that I was right
about everything and you can see the
skiers of the machine
I'd like to say this is probably the
best
live stream you've ever seen
and if you like this and you have not
yet picked up my book
reframe your brain
it's over here
it's right there
and a lot of people are telling me it's
the best book they've ever seen
actually they're saying literally it's
the best book they've ever they've ever
read
now I don't know how often you read a
book and you walk away saying this is
the best book I've ever read
but people are saying good about this
book
so if that doesn't make you curious
I don't know what will
all right thanks for joining YouTube
um
go say goodbye to you now and hope you
enjoyed it and I'll see you tomorrow
