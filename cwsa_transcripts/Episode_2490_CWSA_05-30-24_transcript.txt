[Music]
we're doing a little stalling today
because I have it on good authority the
video doesn't start nearly as quick as I
think it does and therefore if I stall a
little bit longer it's because I'm
waiting for the rest of you to get the
video I'm also going to open
up my own stream here so to
speak there you go got you locals people
on your own feed
now
and I feel like I've waited long enough
I'm going to come up with some kind of
way to stall so everybody can get here
in the future but for now I'm hoping
most of you are here for the
simultaneous
zip oh there we go video
[Music]
everywhere oh welcome to coffee with
Scott Adams the highlight of human
civilization aren't you happy you're
here it's going to be fun today the news
is really serving up Delights and I'm
going to give every one of them to you
cuz you deserve it and if you'd like to
take your experience up to levels that
nobody can understand with their smooth
tiny human brains all you need is a
copper muger a glass of tanker chales a
canteen Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dope me of the
day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous SI happens now go
ah now everything's
better uh I I saw a video today that I
don't I'm not going to try to sell to
you as based on a true thing but there's
a fascinating uh let's say conspiracy
theory that the shuttle the Challenger
Shuttle explosion in 1986 was
faked and that all the astronauts are
alive
and they just took new jobs and with
their same names and same
faces now I'm going to say that that
seems pretty unlikely to
me so I wouldn't wouldn't ask you to
believe it but I love the fact that
reality has become so
unclear that this is in the mix I mean
it's not going to get a lot of attention
but the fact that it happened at all is
is just so crazy because there there's
so little difference between fiction and
reality now in our in our constructed
reality that this got a little attention
anyway uh there's a shocking survey that
nearly half of gen Z people live double
lives online meaning that they have an
online
personality uh that is different from
their regular
personality um
wouldn't that apply to
everyone does anybody have their same
personality online as they do in
person I
don't yeah there there's no way you
could have the same personality
online I feel like the online experience
changes who you are we we change our
personality for every
situation here's me talking to a
CEO hey Bob
how's your investments in the
market here's me talking to a child hey
how's it going oh that's a nice
toy you change you change your
personality completely for every
situation why wouldn't you change it for
online of course you do I
do I'm a little more strident online
than I am in
person I I think people expect me to be
way more intense when they meet me in
person and and they think oh you're
you're not really swearing and screaming
nearly as much as I thought you would I
don't really do that in
person it's there's something about this
experience that brings that out I mean
it's I'm not faking it when I do it
online you know I get worked up I'm
actually worked up but it just doesn't
happen in
person all right
um White House is doing something good
but I think it has more to do with the
Department of energy but uh on Wednesday
they're going to do a bunch of things
that are sort of semi unspecified to
make it easier to build nuclear power
plants in the United
States now I worry that the suite of
things they're allegedly doing to make
it easier to build power plants might be
a suite of regulations and committees
that would make it much harder to build
power
plants however at least we can see the
intention is pointing in the right
direction how many of you were with me
in the early days when I was spending
Untold hours trying to convince people
that nuclear energy is actually the
green energy of the future and we're
there now we're there there's no
disagreement anywhere really I I think
all I think all disagreement on nuclear
just went away and it went away because
of better
information I don't know that I've ever
seen it work before have you when was
the last time there was a a gigantic
incorrect
idea in this case the safety of nuclear
and how how necessary it is have you
ever seen something this
big get changed and I'm not taking
credit for it or anything I'm just
saying I was small part of a very big
change and I think we should be happy
about that
anyway rasmuson did a poll on what
people think of
zinski um I'll just ask you one question
from this uh what percentage of the
public do you think roughly have quote a
very favorable impression of the
Ukrainian president these would be
likely voters I believe what percent do
you think have a very favorable
impression of
zalinski let's see how how M oh wow good
guesses you're right on you oh here
here's so good here so good the answer
is
24 but I will accept
25 yeah I will accept 25 so good all
right uh I have a hard time believing
that we're back in that
guy I I feel like there are a lot of
leaders who are literally just on
cocaine or Aderall or
something we just all about them because
they act they act so interesting when
they're all hyped
up anyway I won't name it many names but
there might be a few other world leaders
who've got a little extra in them if you
know what I mean a little bit
extra all right the appeals court US
appeals court is going to hear Tik tok's
challenge they're going to challenge the
ban which is really a
divestment
um if I had to guess I feel like Tik Tok
is going to
succeed meaning that they will block the
ban because here's what Tik Tock needs
to do I I hate to give them legal
strategy but I will
anyway here's what Tik Tock needs to do
to not make the ban go into effect they
have to stall until the war in Israel is
over that's it because the ban is
largely driven by the fact that it was
so anti-semitic and that that that you
know there were there was a push to ban
it anyway but it wasn't near anywhere
near the Finish Line it didn't look like
it was going to
so it was the Israel situation in Gaza
that caused it immediately to flip
enough votes that the ban was uh
approved by
Congress and signed by the president but
I think I think that one issue was so
important that if they just wear it out
and just let Israel do what it needs to
do and get back to some kind of business
as usual in a year or
so it's probably all they need
because because the energy will go away
and people will say ah it does seem a
little more like a free speech thing
right and when you're in the war like
you're in a hot war and tick Dock's not
on your side that's the way you feel
about it then you're going to act you
know in a in a warlike way you're going
to do things you wouldn't do in a
non-war situation so when the war is
over I'm not so sure the ban is going to
pass all the legal challenges or yeah I
think might I think tiktock might win in
the long
run all right
uh so there was a uh Mexican
mayor who got assassinated in the middle
of a crowd while he was uh
campaigning
and you know when you usually see the uh
you've seen videos of other politicians
being assassinated and you know how it's
always you don't really see the moment
it happened it's usually like oh there's
a bustling in the
crowd in this one the guy is being
filmed up
close and you see the gun go up to the
back of his
head and and you hear the you the shot
now the film didn't show the actual
moment of you know the person being
hit you CU everything went crazy at that
point but the fact that that can happen
at all is just crazy uh Colin rug was
reporting this on X and here I'd like to
make a uh comparison and a
prediction so if you think of me Mexico
in 2024 you think oh my god there the
cartels are in charge and the
government's sort of a puppet and you
know people being murdered in the
streets and all kinds of
illegality here's my question to you
does it look to you like early United
States because it looks that way to me
do you remember the the robber
barons you know the the railroad uh
people and the the bankers and
everything correct me if I'm wrong but
isn't the history of the early United
States huge criminal
Enterprises that happen to also want the
country to succeed so like the mafia
cleans up its own neighborhood I feel
like these gig criminal entities wanted
the country to be a country so they
could you know live in it and do what
they do so I have a a very
counterintuitive prediction about
Mexico I think the cartels will want to
transform into legitimate
businesses I I think they're going to do
a Las Vegas you know Las Vegas started
out as a like a mafia
town but they could make more money just
running a legitimate
operation so over time it's in their
interest and the interest of their
offspring to somehow figure out how to
get that dirty money into a clean
Enterprise and and just run a successful
business so it could get to the point
where being drug mules and Drug Runners
is really profitable but it's not what
you want to be in forever and you know
your kids will someday be slayed by the
you know the competitors so I feel like
there's like a natural Evolution where
the criminals have to be so powerful
that they're effectively the government
and then once they become the government
it may always be a criminal Enterprise
but they'll try to transform it into a
less murderous one because if the murder
goes down the Mexicans are going to say
I don't know you know the lights are on
somebody's building
roads it it's going to look like
everything's working so I feel like the
best case scenario is that the cartels
give full control and then they then
then they try to transform into
something legitimate because the
alternative would be the United States
goes in with the Army and just kills
them all so it feels like that's the
obvious way this goes is that Mexico
will maybe get
worse but then the people in power who
are the criminals are going to want to
going to want to launder their crime
into something more
legitimate that's the most optimistic
thing you'll ever hear about Mexico but
it might get worse
first there's a rumor that uh Trump has
been talking to musk about having some
role in the administration there's news
that they may have met once at some
Billionaire's house and then the Wall
Street General is reporting Journal is
reporting that uh musk and the
billionaire whose name
is Nelson pelts and Musk they all met so
it was pel's house and allegedly musk
and Trump met there and here's the fun
part don't know what this means yet but
listen to how fun this is are you ready
for
this uh muskin fellow fellow billionaire
Nelson pelts quote have told
acquaintances they're working on a
datadriven project to ensure votes are
fairly counted
and they have also quote briefed to
Trump on a plan they have developed to
invest in a datadriven
project to prevent voter
fraud
so how much do you love that I'm I'm
trying to imagine what that would look
like because it could take lots of
forms I'll tell you an idea I had just
in case there's still mulling over ideas
here's what I'd love to
see I would love to
see uh parallel voting
systems literally two legitimate voting
systems and optionally you wouldn't have
to you could vote in
both you see where I'm going
at so optionally you don't have to you
can vote in one and maybe one is the
only one that they count so there's one
official one but there's also a shadow
one and you can go in there and also
vote now when everything's done they
look at the votes of just the people who
chose to vote in the shadow election
which would be counted and tabulated in
an entirely different process perhaps
it's just an app it could be simple as
having an app where you go in and vote
and then as soon as you're done or even
before you go to your app and you just
vote
again then later they survey
just the people who
voted on the app and they find out if
there's any huge difference and you know
the the second no this doesn't quite
work so as I'm thinking through it it
doesn't quite work but the the general
concept would be to have some way that
people can check their own
vote right the ultimate responsibility
is that you can check that your own vote
got to the end but that won't that
doesn't solve the problem of the fake
votes does it which is a bigger problem
yeah I think the counting the votes is
less of a problem than the fact that
there are extra votes that got into the
system they shouldn't have so I'd love
to know what they have in mind uh I
don't have a better idea but uh if the
smartest PE person in the
world who seems to be able to get things
done as well you know musk if he's got
an
idea I'd sure like to hear
it there isn't much I would be more
curious about then how would you do this
you know maybe
some some kind of blockchain situation I
don't
know
um apparently there's a poll coming out
now that says that the Trump and Biden
are virtually tied in
Virginia that's a big deal
apparently um because because Democrats
have W Virginia since 2004 or something
so Virginia used to be more of a toss up
and at one point was a Republican state
but now it's not and the fact that Trump
is tied with Biden in what had been a
reliably Blue State lately is a pretty
big
deal but here's a part that scares me
the most all right the New York Times
was this guy Nate
con uh who's who tells us that the race
is still
close the race is still
close now if you watch Fox News and
right leaning things and you follow
right leaning people would you agree
with that characterization that the
election is still
close because if you're like me you're
fed a continuous diet of it's not
close Trump's way ahead it's not
close but then why would you know a
prominent voice in The New York Times
he's one of their regulars I mean he
works there I think um why would he say
the race is still close
is this what it looks like because what
it looks like is preparation to steal
the
election it it looks like they need to
have um some record that says that
somebody was saying before the election
that it was close so then when it is
close and Biden wins they can say well
it's not a surprise we told you it was
close the whole
time doesn't it feel like an OP I mean I
I think everything's like priming in an
OP now I just don't believe anything's
real so I'm real worried about this but
the other the other possibility which I
would like to alert you to is that you
and I because I think you're in the same
boat as me in this have been brainwashed
into thinking it's not
close what if it is close because I
can't tell I mean I can't tell just
because there's some poles I mean who
knows but it's a very interesting
question that the the media could be
reporting that it's close at the same
time other media is saying it doesn't
look close
anymore those are two completely
different worlds I don't know if that's
just because they're reading the data
differently feels like it's something
deeper well
um I think I'm the only one saying this
but I can't get past it there are some
people in government who look like you
know they're honest people few of them
there's some people look like they're
Liars but you know they're perfectly in
control of their faculties and you know
they're not crazy they're just liars
they're just political team players you
know that sort of thing and then there
are other people who who come off as
demons to me they have faces that don't
there's just something wrong with it
like that it looks like they're
possessed and one of them is you know
Adam Schiff other is Jamie Rasin and
then Biden himself and I am so curious
about what is up with Biden's two
faces you've all noticed he has two
completely different faces right he has
the empty empty vessel face that looks
like Hillary Clinton looking at a
balloon drop it's like it's like he his
he's his mouth forms an O and his eyes
are wide open and it looks like there's
nobody home at all that's the face when
he's done with the speech and he's
he's right and then there's the
are
important but then it goes all the way
to uh uh Jamie Rasin insisting that
um that J that Justice uh Alito could be
forced to recuse himself from the
January 6 um issues oh my God they're so
corrupt they are so so corrupt the
Democrats and this demonfest guy that
the level of corruption is so obvious
it's so in your face now do I think that
Alito or his wife should be flying the
flag that had some political Dimension
to it ah don't give a it was his
wife if there's one standard we should
accept it's that if your spouse does
something and you're in public office
you should get a
pass now people are saying but but but
he had to know about it I don't
care if if his wife decided to do it if
his wife hung it
up it's just a married thing but why do
we have to drag him into it at all yeah
maybe he knew about it
so why does that matter it it we we
can't kick him out of office because his
wife has an opinion that doesn't
work all
right but uh apparently Alito has said
he is not going to recuse himself from
anything and Trump has congratulating
him for having the int intelligence
courage and guts and I would like to uh
Echo that and congratulate Alito for not
recusing himself
because it's the last Bastion of Hope
the Supreme
Court so Glennon Greenwald has this take
he says the now amply Doc mented lies
fed to the public about
Co have for dumb reasons turned into a
liberal versus conservative culture Now
isn't that
weird that we watch every little issue
turn into a political issue when I can't
imagine anything that would be less
political than than the
pandemic because we got similar behavior
on the left and the right you know there
were people on the left and the right
promoting
vaccines you know mass and stuff I mean
granted the right was a little more loud
about resisting stuff or a lot more loud
but I don't think they were resisting
for political reasons were
they the the resistors are just people
who didn't trust the government and they
got this one right how often are you
going to be right if you just guess that
the government is lying this next
time you have a pretty good track record
right if you just said whatever the next
thing is I don't even know what it is
whatever the next thing is the
government tells you I predict will be a
total lie you're going to be pretty
accurate you look like a you know it's a
pretty good
guess so A lot a lot of people uh were
just on that theme and got this one
completely right it saved their life in
some
cases maybe it worked the other way in
some cases but the the thing that
surprised me the most about uh Glenn
greenwald's statement is the first part
the now amply documented lies fed to the
public you know you've been watching all
that stuff trickle out you know I this
email that email this whistleblower that
but by the time Glenn Greenwald who I
would trust to not make statements
without what he calls ample
documentation the fact that he can just
casually state that the whole thing was
a fraud
is it's just
mindboggling and I think their biggest
problem is that we're so
mind-boggled by so many bad behaviors
that we don't know how to deal with any
of them there's just too
much like you could spend your whole
life just trying to fix this one thing
but there are 10 more and they're all
happening at the same time so we're just
overwhelmed with details of stuff
all right uh Charlamagne the God has a
new book out so he's hitting the uh the
circuit and I got to give him
credit um I know he's selling a book so
you know we're all chasing money but
still you have lots of flexibility
within that within that process and he's
going right into the belly of the
Beast he he's he was on the you know
Greg geld
show um and now he was on uh Fox and
Frans
and I I just have to tell you what he
said so I'm just going to read it just
quote so
Charline the god uh if you're not
familiar with his name he's uh black
would you say podcaster or radio host or
both I think both is the right answer
but prominent voice in the black
community anyway he says
uh he was mad at Ms NBC for claiming he
spread Mega views he said people got mad
at me uh back when I was talking about
Governor Greg Abbott and D santis in
Florida saying hey man it's inhumane and
cruel what they're doing to the migrants
but it's actually kind of Genius right
because if you're saying that you're a
sanctuary City and you're saying welcome
welcome we'll take them we'll take them
okay so now that they sent them there
they're like send them back we don't
have enough room for
them he said says what it makes it seems
like the people is uh Republicans were
always right on that issue and the
Democrats were always
wrong and then he clarifies he says I'm
personally against red States sending
illegals to Blue States um because it
you he thought that they needed to be
deported so basically it was on Trump's
side on immigration that they needed to
be deported not sent to other states um
but he says it looks like a blessing in
disguise because it woke up many
liberals to just how bad the Biden
Administration open border policies
are that's
incredible that's
incredible I'm so
impressed you know again he's selling
the book but he has lots of choices
about how to do it and I don't think
he's selling a lot of books to his Base
by going on Fox News and saying Well
turns out the Republicans were totally
right on this immigra thing you know
like the biggest issue in the
country and that he was willing to go
into the you know the I don't want to
say the enemy camp because they're not
enemies at all but he was willing to go
where he knew it was the most
dangerous for free speech now also
selling a book like I say he had options
on how to do that he didn't have to do
it this one way so every time this
happens I know I get in trouble you know
somebody's going to say
Scott stop giving oxygen to Democrats
just because they agree with this one
obvious thing to which I say no I'm not
going to stop doing that I'm going to
give credit to anybody who's a free
speech person who's willing to look at
the whole
field that's how I'm going to play this
if the next thing he says I don't like
I'll say I'll tell you I don't like it
but this was awesome and this this is
what we need more of this is actual
leadership I I would call this
uh actual serious
leadership and I've said for a long time
that the Black American Community is
lacking good leaders that leaders but
you know if you're worshiping George
Floyd and listening to the uh the people
on MSNBC you're not really following
your best most capable people you know
if you're if you're listening to King
Randall you're doing well and if you
listen to the main on this topic well
that's some real
leadership all right CNN is so close to
the truth now um Harry is it Harry enton
their holster uh he's doing a good job
of just laying out the facts without the
spin but he's not quite there yet listen
to how close he
gets well this is CNN in general though
um he's talking about Trump's uh support
among black voters doubled uh up to
21% and uh that it's especially big
difference for black voters under 50 so
for the black voters under 50 Trump has
27%
support and if that held Trump would be
setting records for black support that
we haven't seen since you know a few
decades two decades I
think now
now is that an accurate statement of
what's Happening that black support is
doubling and Trump's doing great with
black support and it's especially
obvious among the young black voters
what's
missing there's something missing there
isn't
there what's
missing it's
men it's men it's the men who are moving
to Trump
do you know why they can't say that do
you think they don't know do you think
that the CNN pollster is unaware that
men are making the massive move among
black uh
Americans of course they know
it what would be a reason that they
wouldn't mention it now I'm not I'm not
going to say that this is specifically
Harry anon's issue because he's on a
network where presumably everybody gets
Direction about what they can and can
not do why why would why is there nobody
even on the Democrat side because you
know you've seen Carville you've seen
people say hey we're losing black
support we needed to fix our
messaging so they talk about it I mean
it's a it's an open topic why don't they
say
men I'll tell you
why if it's not already obvious to you
the minute they say men the whole
Democrat Party will collapse
as soon as that becomes a narrative the
entire Democratic party will collapse
it's it's teetering on the edge right
now the only thing that's keeping all
the men from
leaving is they haven't seen enough
leaders leave
yet but they will because everything's
moving in the same direction and
eventually it will be safe so the men
who go first are the ones who are the
bravest they're just like okay I'm done
with this uh but if you support Trump
bad things will happen to you
yep is there anything
else so so you got to get men to the
point where they will take physical
danger and accept it with a with a
shrug and I think uh black men in
America many of them have reached that
point if you can't be a black man in
America and support Trump think of the
bad things will happen to
you yep what's your
point so that's what's happening men are
done men are fed up and men are going to
destroy the Democrat Party by gutting it
and leaving it and it will be nothing
but a worn out
shell and there's a good chance that
will happen before election
day the the you're going to see the
trickle well it's more than a trickle
now it's more of a more of a full stream
of men leaving that full stream is going
to break the whole Dyke right the the
Dyke's about to break and it's going to
happen quickly so you've heard it said
before the things that go slowly until
they go fast we're still in the slowly
version right but it's going to go fast
and it could happened before the
election
day I I think Trump is only a few words
away from bringing that to
40% well I'll put a Target on it if
Trump says the right things which he is
not done by the way he is not done and
therefore we do not predict that he will
but if he says the right
things he's going to get 40% of the
black
vote he's not there yet he hasn't said
the right
things all
right uh even Nate silver used to work
for the New York Times I always assumed
he leaned a little bit left maybe he
does but I love the fact that I can't
tell because if you were just looking at
his
posts um they just seem like smart
opinions Based on data and some
conjecture you really can't sus out his
political leadings by his post and I
love that I love any public
figure who could operate in a political
domain and you can't tell their party
affiliation that that's pretty that's
laudable anyway um he says I'm sorry but
I'm going to come at this one more time
Democrats spend every available moment
complaining that the media doesn't cover
Trump's misdeeds enough and now there's
an actual criminal trial and the Biden
campaign is complaining that he's being
covered too
much so apparently there are two ways to
lose to Trump
you don't cover him
enough or you cover him
enough two way two ways to lose no way
to
win does it remind you of the trial
itself what happens if uh Trump is is
found uh completely innocent and
acquitted his numbers will go up because
it will show you that you know the trial
was BS what happens if it's a hung
jury his numbers will go up because he
didn't get convicted and everybody sees
it's lawfare what happens if he's
convicted his numbers will go up the
higher courts will overturn it he won't
go to jail because the nature of the
offense you know even though the the
highest level is bad if you if you don't
have a criminal record you pretty much
are going to be free you'll just have to
I report in or something
so Trump has managed to get himself in a
situation where every path has him
winning and the Democrats created that
he didn't create that there was no part
of trump who said hey you know what it
would be good for me if if you do some
stupid lawfare trials let's do lots of
them all over the country he didn't say
that the Democrat
plan executed perfectly as you see is
created the situation where Trump can
win in every
path he didn't create that they did if
he had just been out there talking who
knows what have happened he might have
said something else they could take out
of
context but they found the only way they
can guarantee his
election unless the election is
rigged
um so Trump uh issued a truth today in
which he was quing Greg
geld and uh so in other words if he if
he quoted GRE Greg it means he agrees
with the statement so let me read the
statement see if you agree too so this
is from Greg geld uh no one knows what
the crime is uh but it's the trial that
is the crime what is interesting about
this is it paints Trump in an incredibly
appealing way he's up against the wall
meanwhile Joe Biden needs a wall to
stand up on and this guy he's best when
he's angry and he's focused and he's
direct meaning Trump when you compare
the way he is and uh that kind of energy
to what is in the white house now is
persuasive I mean you look at this guy
and go I get it that guy's pissed off
and he's clear meanwhile this guy u
meaning Biden speaks in these amorphous
fantasies about quote a threat to
democracy and then he says he can't
solve anything uh he doesn't know what's
going on and this guy's mean well he's
got this guy a few times so when he's
talking about uh fighting for his life
that's Trump and I mean he's pretty
Stark choice for Americans all right so
here's the part I wanted to call out the
key part of that is saying that Biden uh
speaks in these amorphous fantasies
about a threat to
democracy Trump spotted that and called
it
out oh he's so
close he's so close
Mock and
meme Mock and
meme I want to see Trump mocking the
idea that he's going to steal your
democracy and you'll never get to vote
again I want to see him laughing about
it in an interview or or
rally I want him to treat it the way it
should be treated as the election is
over because they've capitulated on
policies
incompetence and what else do want you
want somebody who has the right policies
and they're competent to pull it
off Democrats have conceeded policy and
competence because they don't really
talk about those things anymore they
only talk about magical things like uh
what if Trump finds a magic lamp on the
beach and rubs it and the genie makes
him a dictator for life because unless
it comes from a genie how in the world
is this guy supposed to take over the
country with his private Army that
doesn't exist with his base of magga
supporters who would have none of that
there's no mag of supporters who are
going to say you know what let's get rid
of our Constitution and try dictatorship
the the fact that they're even selling
this to their own idiot base that
Republicans don't like the Constitution
and they what they really want as a
dictator have you met a
Republican even once in your whole life
no Republican is going to put up with a
dictator even if it's their guy none you
I don't think you could find one if you
search the whole country find one
Republican who genuinely thinks we
should turn into a trump
dictatorship I'm pretty sure that's zero
right and yet they're selling that to
their base like it's
real all right well at least uh Trump
has caught the scent he reads the room
better than anybody in in my mind Trump
is the most natural most gifted
politician of our time Bill Clinton was
amazing as a politician I think Trump's
got him I I think he's the best he's the
he's the
goat all right here's the Democrat
imaginary issues update um so Biden said
that that whatever Gathering I think it
was a black college you said uh was it a
church or a college I can't remember but
it was a gather in of uh black audience
and Biden was talking to him and he said
uh they're trying to erase black
history who
who what who's tried to erase black
history you talking about DeSantis you
know not wanting CRT in the schools or
something this is not a real thing
there's not a single Republican in the
world who thinks it's a good idea to get
rid of black history there might be
something about emphasis and context and
you know making sure all the bases are
touched and stuff like that there's
nobody wants to get rid of black
history that's not a thing that's
totally
imaginary so at that imaginary thing
they're trying to erase black history to
he's stealing my democracy and there
will never be another election that's
that's what punchie denero says there'll
never be another
election
now at the same time
uh Biden starts telling the audience um
he says diversity equality and inclusion
are literally the core strengths of
America that's why I'm proud to have the
most diverse Administration in history
it starts at the top with the vice
president I don't know how they heard
that but the way I heard it was I'm
hiring based on
race did you hear it
differently I mean to me it looks like
he was just saying I'm a giant racist
and I'm going to get
worse cuz I'm hiring based on
race and we observe that he has a very
diverse group his uh his campaign staff
the top two people I believe unless it's
changed recently the top two people
would be um a Hispanic woman at the top
and a black man I think is number
two now did they scour all the talent in
the world and decided that those two
were the ones or do you think there's
any possibility that his wanting to make
sure that our core strengths of
diversity equality and inclusion drove
him
to favor People based on their color and
gender and uh
background I don't
know
um but to me it looked pretty
racist you ready for the punch line at
this all I say the theme for the end all
right this is kind of delicious you
ready for this turn on your pattern
recognition pattern recognition
on I'm going to tie a few stories
together uh you remember uh James
Carville said that the the messaging is
basically stupid and whoever is running
the campaign must be
idiots I'm paraphrasing but he basically
said it as clearly as that right so
that's James Carville just hold hold
them in your mind I'm I'm gonna give you
three names and while I'm talking about
them I want you to hold a picture and
it's going to be like a a split screen
but three there going to be three people
so I want to want you to imagine the
three of them next one is there's a
story that uh a Democrat advisor type
Doug shown so he's a he's a white guy if
you don't know what he looks like uh
he's one of me you know bald white guys
with glasses I think you we all look
like a thumb with glasses but just
imagine him and he says the White House
is quote near total freeze out on
outside advice outside
advice uh has one Democratic strategist
concern that could be big trouble for
the
campaign and on Fox and Friends shown
outlined how the administration is
trying to um failing to heed warnings
um basically listening to the voters so
Doug Shon says that uh quote outside
advice has been blocked outside advice
would would outside advice be James
Carville sounds like they're freezing
him out how about Doug shown himself
well he's the one that brought it up so
I'm guessing you feels maybe he's a
little frozen
out David Axelrod tweeted today
um he said uh whoever at Biden
headquarters directed Deniro's
performance Tuesday outside the
courthouse where Trump is on trial
probably should have left it on the
cutting room floor and they had some
more thoughts on on the CNN
site David
Axelrod white guy put him on the list
now now just imagine him James
Carville Doug
shown David Axelrod
have you seen the pattern
yet the pattern is there are three older
white guys who are saying pretty
directly that they're being ignored in
favor of whoever's on the inside and as
we know the inside is a Dei
operation so even the white guys in the
Democratic party are calling foul but
they can't use the words directly they
have to go at it
indirectly I think you could be taken
better
advice it seems to me that some of the
outside advice is being
ignored I feel as if you might change
your direction if you listen to some
people who have been there before you
see how carefully they have to approach
it but here's what you could have
predicted about
Dei it will definitely crash the country
and you can see a massive wave of
incompetence because of it not because
of anybody's genes and not because of
anybody's culture I have to say that
every time it's because of math if if
you favor hiring from a group that the
smallest pool of applicants because the
pipeline is is pathetic the pipeline
from Early Education to qualified
employees is pathetic it needs to be
fixed but because that situation the
math of it is that if you if you use
diversity as your primary uh variable
which Biden says he does he's saying it
pretty directly you should end up with
incompetence um everywhere so what we're
seeing now is the Dei campaign
collapsing right in front of you and the
white men in the Democratic party trying
to sound the alarm but they
can't they're in a dream where they're
trying to scream but have you ever been
in that dream where you're trying to
scream to warm somebody but your voice
doesn't work you're
like and you can't
talk you've had that dream right I think
there are a whole bunch of white
advisers who are having that dream right
now if you would just listen to me for
like a minute I might be able to fix
this and they're not being listened
to so I think what you're seeing is a
very public example of Dei um
collapse so you can if you take a good
organization and you you inject a few
people who are not up to speed you know
not quite as good as the people who are
already there it won't make much
difference you know you train them you
know maybe over time that they're
replaced but at some point the the ratio
of people have been forced into the
system because of the diversity goal
should destroy every organization it's
part
of so if you want to see what's going to
happen to your company just look at the
Biden campaign do do you wonder what
Apple computer will look like in a few
years it'll look like the Biden
campaign do you wonder what uh you know
Nvidia is going to look like in a few
years it's going to look like this
because they they will all be forced
under the current set of you know um the
current way we operate they will all be
forced to increase their diversity to
the point of failure and the Biden
campaign went first you know as the
leaders in this
type of approach to the world they they
were the most aggressive on pursuing Dei
and here's the result the result is
they've destroyed not just their chances
of winning but maybe the party
forever I I think it might be a death
blow because if they lose black men
they're just done and they're going to
lose black
men they're losing Hispanic men they're
losing men if they lose men they're just
done I'm sorry sorry that's the end of
it and we're very close they're right on
the edge of losing it
all America First legal is uh filing a
complain complaint with the doj and EOC
about the uh and the Iowa Civil Rights
group against uh Tyson
Foods for alleged violation of law
including employing illegal aliens over
American citizens racial discrimination
and exploitation of child labor I guess
they tossed in that child labor thing
just for good
measure um this is the counterpower that
I've been waiting for and these guys are
doing great so America First
legal is probably one of the few things
that's going to keep the country
together because there needed to be some
counterforce to the extraordinary levels
of EXT discrimination against Americans
and against uh especially uh adult white
men
so are we going to get a trial decision
today do do you think the jury will
decide
today I think there's a good
chance but here let me give you my tea
leave
reading I believe there's a hold
down and here's why and I believe that I
have a superior opinion than the
professional lawyers who have been trial
lawyers for decades and are looking at
the same situation now with no trial
lawyer experience whatsoever I'm going
to disagree with the number of them I
saw they said that asking for
clarifications doesn't really mean
anything you can't use that to
predict I say that would be true in a
normal case where the jury has no
interest in the situation they just want
to get it right if the only thing you
care about is getting it right then yes
there'll be lots of requests for
information but this isn't that
this is a case where where no case was
was
presented so if no case is presented and
we'll talk about all the things that are
bad with the case
but I think the fact that somebody asked
questions confirms the
following I think in these situations
based on my own experience as a jurist I
think they always do a vote count early
so sometime in the first hour and maybe
in the first 10 minutes they would say
all right here's pieces of paper
everybody tell us how you would vote if
you were to vote right now because they
want to see how far they are like if if
it turned out to be six and six you
would approach this thing completely
differently than if it's 11 to1 if it's
11 to1 you're going to everybody's going
to say all right our job is to convert
the one
right that that that's what you would
think your job was if you're the 11 all
right we got to you know we're so close
we got to convert the
one um so that would be a normal case
but in this case do you think that
people made up their own minds because
it's Trump this is one of those cases
where I would assume that not a single
person on the jury cared about the
evidence too
much and so when I see that um
clarification has been requested my
interpretation is why would you ask for
any clarification if everybody's already
decided and I think they have because
they're deciding politically not based
on the law so I think it indicates
there's a hold
down what do you
think I I have a strong feeling that it
couldn't mean anything else because
here's what it definitely doesn't mean
it definitely doesn't mean that the 12
people decided he's guilty because if
they decided he was guilty what would
they have done differently
they would have given themselves the
weekend off because they would already
know that they're already ready to to uh
to vote guilty and then Suppose there
was a conversation somebody said to me
Scott what if they're talking about you
know which one of those three different
crimes they can decide on maybe they
disagree on that maybe they're trying to
get it all on the you know unanimity
about some of the details to which I say
that's the sort of thing you do when
it's not the
weekend the Friday effect is really
strong and the other lawyers were saying
the same thing jurors really really
really want to be done on
Friday and in this case especially they
really really really didn't want to be
there
today so if they willingly as a group
accepted the extra pain to be there it's
not about the
details there's a hold
out there's a at least one and the Wall
Street Journal gave a little uh summary
of the uh jurors you very very cursory
highlevel summary of who they
are but I've got a strong feeling about
two of
them here are my two favorites now this
this is all we know about them all right
uh one of them is a man who's an
investment banker he likes hiking music
and concerts so that part means nothing
um new sources he reads are uh basically
everything and he follows Michael Cohen
Trump and quote anyone who might affect
markets on social
media so the way he described the fact
that he follows the news on both sides
is that it's part of his job as an
investor
maybe
maybe do you know who else
follows both sides of every uh of every
topic not
Democrats have you ever heard of a
Democrat saying that uh yeah I'm a
Democrat but I'm also in truth social
and I follow a bunch of conservatives
because I like to know the whole story
none it's not a thing when somebody says
I basically follow everything in the
news they're screaming I'm a
Republican or the very very at least an
independent who leans a republican all
right but it gets
better I guess they were all asked the
question what they feel about
Trump so in his own words here's what he
feels about Trump I might not like some
of his policies but there has been some
good for the United
States bing bing bing bing bing bing
bing bing bing
bing nobody talks like that
except prot Trump
people do you know what prot Trump
people all like to say well I don't like
everything he does but overall he's
positive I mean that comes right out of
the Republican way of talking basically
yeah and he's an and he's an investment
banker and he's a
man oh
yeah oh yeah all right here's the next
one juror number
four uh do you this is the funniest
one all right this this one I don't know
if I can do it without laughing uh juror
number four was asked if he had strong
feelings about Trump here was the answer
quote no not
really there he
is there are two patriots who made it
onto the jury
there are two yeah strong feelings not
really gender man job security engineer
for 25 years 25
years that would make him an older
gentleman and
engineer
security do you think the people who are
concerned about security of anything be
it cyber or any other of security do you
think people with a security
mindset if they're a male and they're
older you think they might have a little
bit of feeling about Trump that maybe he
would make you a little more secure if
your whole filter on life is
security and you and you're an engineer
so you're an engineer so you can
actually
see that the case is
 because you're not dealing on
an emotional level if you're not dealing
with it emotionally you can see it's
clearly the case hasn't been
made juror number two and juror number
four work couting on
you new sources what do you think the
new sources were for the uh security
engineer quote scattering of all things
here and there
who says
that zero
Democrats nope there is no Democrat who
says yeah I sample all the news
nope do you want me to take it home if
you're not sure that this is a
conservative yet
Hobbies woodworking in metalworking and
we're done here
you don't think these two guys are going
to hang that
jury oh they're going to hang the jury
yeah they're going to hang it
hard you give me the guy with 25 years
in security
engineering who works with wood and
metal gets his information from a
scattering of all things here and there
and when asked what he feels about Trump
looks you right in the eyes and
says yeah not really don't have much of
a feeling about it at
all that man came there to do some
business that's a man who knows exactly
what he's going to do yeah I think I
think that's a hung
jury and then I looked at some of the
other jurors and uh they seemed equally
likely that they would just convict no
matter what the evidence was you know uh
mostly women all right here are some
problems with the case in case you
haven't heard them uh first of all
there's a pattern of the White House
meeting with prosecutors and the the
various lawfare cases which suggests as
part of a RICO coordinated government
attempt to uh interfere with the
election very obvious we can all see it
that's documented um we know that the
prior da looked at the case and said
nope there's nothing here refused to
take it up we know that the number three
uh lawyer in the Biden Department of
Justice took a demotion to take the case
Nobody Does that which indicate strongly
it's political um the jury did not they
were not allowed to have the
instructions from the judge in writing
in the room it took 90 minutes for the
judge to read the
instructions that's how complicated they
are and the instructions will largely
determine which way they go uh except
for the heroes and
uh they're not allowed to have a written
copy in the room Byron York points out
that the jury instructions have been
posted on the New York Court's website
so now everybody on the planet Earth
with access to a web
page except the
jurors the only people who should be at
reading them only the jurors can't see
it so that makes sense okay
uh you've got the judge who's totally
conflicted who magically got selected
for all three Trump related uh things
from Bannon to weiselberg to now Trump
even though judges are randomly selected
obviously not randomly selected and he's
donated to Democrats and his daughter is
a big Democrat fundraiser who will make
a lot of money if Trump gets convicted
people
say we've got this novel case where they
had to somehow Frankenstein up uh felony
charge by putting together pieces of
misdemeanors and then confusing you and
writing the jury instructions just so
basically manufacturing a crime that had
no victims and nobody gave a about
until Trump said he was running for
president um my favorite part is that
the Trump defense had to rest because
this is how the process worked in this
case the defense had to
rest before the
prosecution told the jury what the crime
was that he's being charged
with now we could have just said that
right could have just said
that and then on top of that they've got
with these weird instructions where the
jury can say well it doesn't matter
which crime he was covering up if he was
covering up a crime it must be a
felony but they give him a
a menu choice of things they can pick as
the crime and none of those crimes have
to be determined to be true and they can
all decide it's a different crime that
they're going to base their opinion
on completely reversible errors all over
the place
here
um and then let's see what
else uh
uh and then there was even a judge on uh
msdi
that uh said that was a surprise to me
because generally jury instructions
don't include references to specific
pieces of evidence that the judge seems
to be pointing to so the the judge gives
them um directions on you know how to
proceed on the findings of fact but then
tells them sort of points out something
specific to focus
on which apparently is
non-standard which basically is trying
to bias the jury to get whatever he
wants it looks
like let's see what
else so that's just the problems we know
about right that's just the problems we
know
about um John le le I think I'm
pronouncing that wrong my French is not
good but on X um he's talking about how
the
uh the the public well first of all the
polls show that people don't care I I
guess CNN was reporting the polls show
that people don't even care about the
trial it's they're not basing their
votes on it and if he gets convicted or
doesn't convicted they don't care seems
like I think his popularity will go up
no matter what but we'll see but uh John
LEF points out that the magnitude of the
Injustice Trump is facing is lost on
most people I think that's true and I
think there's a bit of disbelief
involved and I'll say I'm guilty of
it my brain can't conceive that he would
be put in jail with this
process and so I can't get as worked up
about it being
evil because I also can't see it as
happening so I think other people might
be in that boat too it's like well it's
one of those legal things it'll probably
work out and I don't have to pay
attention to it so that's going on
but as John points out Trump is facing
34 felony counts for improper paperwork
over the use of personal funds nearly a
decade ago each count carries a maximum
sentence of four
years and the jury doesn't even have to
agree on what Trump is guilty of in
order to convict just hold that in your
mind the jury doesn't have to
agree in just this case alone when they
normally they have to agree on what what
happened they don't have to agree those
are in the jury
instructions unbelievable but when you
compare that as John points out to
Hillary Clinton she invented the Russ
hoax lied about it paid this for the
steel dossier and papered it as legal
services with the intention of
influencing the election and her total
punishment was an $8,000 fine that
somebody else
paid compared to
we're going to put Trump in jail for
life for a way way smaller
nothing all right um on other topics uh
Mario noal had some reports from other
people David Pine claiming that Russia
is successfully jamming 90% of the
guided missiles headed their way so the
American missiles the good stuff
apparently the Russians are really good
at jamming the GPS making them useless
so I guess they're going to use dumb
bombs
instead don't know if that's true but it
sounds true I saw somebody say that
China could invade and take over Taiwan
in one hour there's a military expert
who said that uh that within 15 minutes
they could take the airports and within
30 minutes they would have the
capital yeah well okay now people say
but you know that would be the end of
the world because they would take over
the uh chip
to which I
say wouldn't they sell them to us I mean
it would accelerate our own operation to
get more chips
but they wouldn't want to destroy the
chip plants and China's got a bad bad
situation because if they destroy the
economy of the United States they lose
their
customers so you can't really survive
that so
anyway um I don't think necessarily the
chips are at risk they're at risk for
sure and then I did hear that the chip
manufacturers had some kind of kill
switch where they could blow up the
factories if the if the island gets
invaded that sounds more like the sort
of thing you'd threaten than the sort of
thing You' do but maybe I mean maybe the
US CIA would take it out it could be
that our own Spooks of already you set
it up
for the uh building
seven it might get building
seven if you believe that all
right uh here's a story in The Epic
Times um so there was a study of uh I'm
not going to spend much time on this so
this is just the last thing but they
found that uh masks didn't work during
Omicron and made things
worse so masks didn't work during
Omicron it made things worse however
interestingly their findings were that
the mask did work a little bit before
Omicron who said
that I did so once again you could skip
all the science and just ask me yeah the
masks probably worked when it was a
deadly virus and everybody was wearing
them but by the time you got to Omicron
half the people weren't wearing them and
was way too catchy it didn't make any
sense so it probably made things worse
but the according to the science which
doesn't mean it's true just this one
study it says that if both people wore a
mask during the uh you know the original
virus there was a statistical
Advantage
so that's exactly what I said I said it
might slow it down a little bit but it's
not enough to make this a mandate so I'm
only bringing it up because science has
caught up to me or at least this one
study I am against mask
mandates let me be
clear oh here here come the the uh the
people who
were fooled
by so I'm being called a hypocrite now
by the people who are fooled by the
4chan hoax so there are lots of people
who still believe the 4chan hoax is
about my pandemic make opinions but I'll
remind you I had the most accurate
predictions by far it's just that you
heard that they were the opposite of
what they
are and somebody says no you were fooled
I was
fooled I just told you I agreed with the
science now that doesn't mean the
science is right but I think it's worth
noting that the science took a while and
then they came exactly to my
position yeah the the people who want to
be right are just desperate to want to
be right but
sorry dude you were blacklisted now
you're making a
comeback I was blacklisted by the people
who there was one cartoonist who made a
joke about my pandemic opinions and half
the country thought it was real
Mass AR thing for the cies blah
blah just that you didn't know how to
take an
experimental you didn't know not to take
it
well do I look unhealthy to
you or do I look like a person who took
some excellent
vacations ended my pandemic experience
months before you did
because I got all my rights
back and as far as I can tell no no
medical problems and currently I'm also
on the right side of um current
science because the current science says
the vaccinations were probably bad for
young people but probably a good bet for
people who were in my
category so there are a lot of people
under 60 who are saying hey why did you
over 60 people with asthma take this
drug when I
didn't well you're not really good at
analyzing things are you if I were 25 I
would not have taken it if I didn't need
to travel probably wouldn't have taken
it but I had an amazing
experience I Got No
Effects so apparently you being a bunch
of
 all you got was the same good
health that I have and no Vacations so
was being a frightened was that
your strategy that worked out really
well for you are you proud of it being a
frightened
 because I was frightened neither
by the shots nor by the
virus you were frightened by one of
those two things I was frightened by
neither and I ended up taking a chance
and it worked out which part of that
sounds dumb to
you the part where I had excellent
vacations and good
health all right that's enough of that I
just lost half of my followers all right
that's all I got I've been told that
when I say goodbye here there's a
annoying delay and then it looks like
I'm being um it looks like I'm being
rude because I just
disappear so I'm going to say goodbye
and then I'm going to leave this long
awkward pause at the end while the
technology catches up with me all right
so I'm going to it's going to look like
the show is over and then I'm just going
to sit here drinking my coffee all right
thanks everybody um thanks for joining I
am going to go talk to the locals people
privately in a
moment but not
until I leisurely sit my coffee waiting
for the technology to catch
up all right locals only here we
come
e
e
e
e
