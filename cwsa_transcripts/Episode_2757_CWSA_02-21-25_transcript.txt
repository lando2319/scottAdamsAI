well if you're here and I'm here we
should do something how about a show
anybody up for a
show let's see stock markets looking a
little weak
BL blah
but I'm sure we'll be better later let's
call up the comments on locals and see
what we got going
here everybody good this
morning it's going to be exciting it
always
is good morning everybody y not that
studio there we
go there I am
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams because it is but if you'd
like to take this special experience up
to levels that nobody can even
understand with their tiny shiny human
brains well all you need for that is a
cuper a Mugger a glass a tank of Chalice
of Stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel
of any and fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure of the dopa
beine the end of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous hip and it's going to
happen right
now I could feel the
simultaneity it was a little special
today it was
good well here's some good news the odds
of that asteroid hitting the Earth are
now down to uh a quarter of 1% quarter
of
1% we were up to about 3% at one point
that it was going to hit us by 2032 but
now we're down to a quarter of 1% so
celebrate don't look up don't look
up
meanwhile uh let's see uh the most
important story of the day really is
that Canada won the the hockey game uh
to become the leader or the winner of
the what the hell was it you can tell
how much I follow hockey oh the highly
anticipated four nations championship
game yeah so Canada congratulations nice
win see how easy it is to be
nice
congratulations and I I did turn it on
just to see if there had been any fights
over the national anthem yeah it was a
little a little complaining about it but
no big deal so uh it was probably just a
good game I didn't watch the rest but
I'm glad we're back to just playing
sports and getting over it you know when
we have a disagreements with Canada it
doesn't really feel like other
disagreements does it it it feels it
just feels so much like a sibling kind
kind of a thing where you know one
sibling is saying ah you're really a
governor and the other sibling is saying
ah will you we're a
country none of it I take too seriously
so it it seems all
performative but I'm glad we're at least
not fighting about hockey you'll be
fascinated to know that Stephen King who
left X is
back and uh he said uh did you miss me
and uh Elon mus said that he
did which actually makes sense if your
job is to get a lot of traffic on X but
here's my question are we supposed to
believe that Stephen King left de
because it was so terrible but then he
returned after it got I would imagine in
his point of view even
worse doesn't it seem seem like Stephen
King is doing this for a job now I know
he doesn't need the money and you know I
wouldn't call the job per se but do you
think he's just doing it completely
independently and that one day he said
you know you know it would be really fun
is if I lose half of my customers by
taking a firm political stand and then
being totally abused online for months
and months and months and months did he
do that because he just thought it was
fun
it couldn't have possibly been fun and
then he laughed and I thought oh okay
well maybe he was doing it for fun and
has stopped being fun and now he's back
doesn't it feel exactly like he's being
let's say managed by some other
entity I don't know what it would be but
it definitely doesn't look like anything
organic so I don't
know meanwhile there's a mystery on x uh
one of the more uh say notable users of
X Brian romelli he's been
suspended now since I don't know why he
was suspended I don't have a firm
opinion on it but I don't recall him
being the type of person who would be
suspended because he doesn't say
provocative things about
anything so whatever the reason is it's
going to be something we didn't see
coming
now the only thing I could think is that
he was working hard to make sure that
people had good private AI they could
run on their own devices and he was
experimenting a lot with AI and is it
possible he said something about AI or
did something with AI that crossed some
boundary I don't know I'm just
speculating but he's not exactly the
kind of person who was making uh let's
say social commentary I don't I'm not
sure he ever did so what would that be
about very curious I'm very very curious
if anybody finds it out let me know okay
he's probably on some other social
network by
now while the governor of New York Kathy
oal she has decided she will not remove
my brother from another mother Eric
Adams from Office the mayor uh I guess
there was some
historical predent that would have
allowed her to do it but it wouldn't
have been easy to remove him from office
so instead she's going to put guard
rails on him and make sure that there's
some kind of standards that she seems
happy with I don't know what that's all
about the but the guard real seemed dumb
and uh I guess that just mean she didn't
really have anything she could
do cash Patel has been voted in as you
know so he's he's approved as the head
of the FBI
uh now the thing that makes this the
most
fun is we've never really had a full
accounting of the Russia collusion
hoax we've kind of treated it like was
it true was it not true but really it
was an OP I mean it was this big
organized op by people that were pretty
well aware of and Adam Schiff of course
the big uh opponent of cash Patel being
approved and uh at one point in a
podcast I told you this before cash
Patel had said that Adam Schiff was the
biggest criminal in
Congress now I don't know what he meant
exactly by criminal because I don't know
what criminal act we're talking about
I'm not aware of a criminal act uh
unless there's something about putting
together an op and lying about the skiff
that's criminal I I don't think there is
because I think people in Congress can
lie all day long and it's not criminal
as far as I know so I love having the
guy who was fighting the Russia
collusion hoax while it was happening
cash Patel now in charge of the
FBI and uh things might get interesting
now we don't know now I don't I wouldn't
bet on it you know like I don't think
Adam Schiff really has anything to worry
about uh but I see a lot of people
saying oh when's the Epstein list going
to be
revealed do you know what the answer to
that is of when the Epstein list will be
revealed well there are two
possibilities one is that it doesn't
really exist because do you really think
there's a
list really you think there's a
list maybe I mean anything's possible
but if it doesn't exist it won't be
released that makes sense
now what if it does exist well if it
does exist it's definitely not going to
be
released because whatever is on that
list would be far more valuable for the
government to keep secret so they can do
what Epstein was doing which is have
complete control over the people on the
list so there are only two possibilities
it doesn't exist so it won't be released
or it does exist so it definitely won't
be released
only two possibilities so no you're not
going to see any Epstein list forget
about
that well at CPAC I guess Javier M from
Argentina showed up and gave Elon Musk a
sort of ceremonial cool chainsaw looking
thing I don't think it was
operational
um and uh that was
fun um one of the things I love about
having Javier mle just insert himself
into the American story and associate
with Elon Musk is that at least
according to the
news what M did is working now I don't
think we're seeing all of the
news do you really think that Javier M
just you know took a chainsaw to a huge
part of the
government and then it was just all good
like only good things happened that
that's not even a possibility so if
you're not also hearing about what the
downside was such as you know maybe
somebody got you know not as good health
care or not as good police protection or
the garbage didn't picked up I don't
know must be something but did he really
just Chainsaw the whole government
spending and everybody was just fine and
the only thing that happened was
inflation went way
down does that sound real to you
is there any real world in which you can
do something that
dramatic and it's only good all good no
downside I don't even think that about
America I mean I'm 100% in favor of
Doge but I think we all understand it's
going to break some eggs so to speak and
there'll be some things you have to
rapidly you know put back the way it was
like oops I didn't realize that was that
important so I don't know the whole
Javier Mele story I don't buy it the way
it's being told it's a little too on the
nose a little too weirdly successful in
a way the real world doesn't work but
again like Doge I'm completely in favor
of it so I'm completely in favor of
what's happening in Argentina I just
think we're not getting the whole story
you know we could handle it there might
be a downside I think it's worth doing
overall it probably save the country and
I think doge is worth doing overall it's
probably going to save the country if
anything
can but really let's not act like
there's never a
downside
um and then uh somebody somebody
challenged Elon Musk at that event I
guess he was on stage and he was asked
about being a uh a papa of Putin and he
he had a good answer I I mean he had a
crowd pleasing answer and the crowd
pleasing answer is he said that people
sometimes say I'm bought I'm a bought
asset of Putin and then Elon said I'm
like he can't afford
me that does seem true how could he
possibly afford
him you know how much money would you
have to give
him you you'd have to give him more than
well it have to be enough that it
changes his life somehow what would be
the amount of money that would change
his life trillion dollars you can't you
Russia can't give him a trillion dollars
so it's actually true what it would take
to bribe him if if there is even a
number I'm not assuming there is any
number that would bribe him but it would
be a trillion he Russia can't afford
that as just a
bribe while the federal judge ruled that
Trump can continue the mass firing of
federal workers let me add that
to let me add that to the list
of of things that were too boring to
follow uh the Court's trying to stop
Doge uh the court got overturned trying
to stop Doge but now they're doing a
different thing to trying to stop Doge
oh it's a different court it's a
different judge it's a different
approach well that got overturned that
got delayed I can't follow it
but apparently doge is still going
ahead um one of the things that uh Trump
is floating is the idea that uh I don't
know if it means if they get all if they
get to $2 trillion doll in in Doge uh
budget reduction that that they would
use that as a trigger to give 20% of it
would be which would be about $400
billion uh back
to um taxpayers
to which I
say um now some people I I think Jesse
waters on Fox News was saying that uh
why wouldn't you give it back why
wouldn't you give at least some of it
back because it's our money it's our
money um what's wrong with that what's
wrong with the statement that of course
you should give it back it's our
money it it's not money at all
it's not anybody's money it's not
money what
money reductions in future budgets is
not
money what are you talking
about if I tell you that next year I'm
not going to build uh buy a
house did I make some
money future budget nons spending isn't
anybody's
money you would have to increase debt to
give away $400 billion debt is nobody's
it's nobody's money that would be like
saying hey Scott would you like me to
give
you
$100,000 I'd say yeah all right here's
what I'm going to do I'm going to
increase your debt by
$100,000 uh because I'll take out a loan
in your name and then I'll give it to
you and I'll say you damn right you
going to give it to me it's my
money it's it's nobody's money it's
debt you can't give somebody their own
debt I don't know I don't I don't think
I'm explaining it right but it's not
money it's just a way that we could
possibly avoid going down the drain
faster than we
are
so in my opinion there's no good reason
to give $400 billion and if2 trillion I
don't like anything about it so I I
guess I'm going to go on record as
saying if if you have to already get the
two
trillion before it activates you know
the 400 billion give back I'm not even a
little bit for it I just want to save
the country and let everybody benefit
from
that anyway
um Trump is threatening the state of
main for defying his executive order um
about keeping men out of women's sports
he says we're not going to give them any
federal
funding so according to Trump allowing
men biological men and women's
sports doesn't get you any money in
Maine gives new meaning to the phrase my
main
man I worked on that all all morning and
that's the best I could do my main
man didn't work did it it just sort of
laid there you're like Maine oh I get it
sort of like a dad joke on the state
name of Maine yeah okay got it yeah
we'll just leave that one
there meanwhile over on CNN van Jones
had some things to say about Elon Musk
and all the
doging um he said that Elon Musk is now
remember do you remember my uh reframe
from yesterday the re frame was that uh
the Republicans are mostly talking about
real things the dead is real Russia
Ukraine war is real real
stuff uh you know men and women sports
that's
real but the uh the Democrats have
become sort of the the fanfiction
interpretive
dance uh party they don't really deal
with real things they imagine things
that might go wrong in the
future and that's it imaginary things
that could go wrong in the future now
you can't say they're wrong because it's
things that could go wrong in the future
but you could say they're not doing
anything because literally everything
could go wrong in the future if you
implement it
wrong if tomorrow somebody said hey we
got this free techn techology that will
make egg prices really low somebody
would say oh so it's going to be like a
monopoly thing uh you know could go
wrong they'll form a monopoly put all
the other egg people on a business then
the people with the secret egg making
thing will be in charge of us all so
basically you're saying you're in favor
of Monopoly of
eggs okay that could
happen but why don't we deal with what
did happen the price of eggs just went
down so here's van Jones on CNN he says
uh about Elon Musk he says he's quote
abandoning his children and doing
theatric as he puts a chainsaw of the
government the government that quote our
parents
built is any of
that like talking about the real world
or anything you care
about do I care that your parents built
it I mean what exactly is the relevance
of that you either like it or you don't
like it I don't care who built it um he
said you unleash somebody meaning musk
who's who's doing theatrics abandoning
his children having some weird fantasy
in front of everybody to be popular oh
okay so the problem is his
character
remember as long as Democrats are locked
into bad character instead of any kind
of policy stuff they can't possibly win
and they can't get out the character
mold they're they're completely locked
in some weird fantasy trying to be
popular do you think that's what musk is
doing do you think that he's he's uh
trying to be popular who in the world
tries to be popular by siding with
Trump
what that that's bordering
insane that's the last thing you do if
you wanted to be popular you would just
make really good electric cars really
good satellites and whole boring
machines and
spaceships that would make you very
popular but no siding with Trump that
takes 50% of your popularity away day
one and it never comes back so that
seems like a weird fantasy fiction kind
of thing that's not happening in the
real
world and then
is Van says that mus is going to do
whatever he wants with no oversight
why are we watching we're all watch
we're all giving oversight he's
reporting exactly what he's doing if he
does something we don't like there's
still time to reverse it you know if you
take away a budget you can give it back
if you fire some people maybe some of
them need to get hired back which is
exactly the process it's not meant to be
clean and uh and then uh said that is
anti-American and it's Reckless and it's
wrong how many of those things were
real let's see The Reckless the wrong
the abandoning his family which you know
he has no no sense of what anything musk
is doing privately uh weird fantasies
it's all just made up
stuff all made up stuff where where is
the where's the alternative
suggestion all right let me give you the
alternative suggestion this is what
everybody who doesn't understand how the
real world Works says make
sense oh instead of using a chainsaw
they should use a
scalpel the next time you hear anybody
say they should use a
scalpel you should ignore everything
they ever say from that day
on if you really believe this could get
done with a
scalpel you are so far from
understanding anything about how
anything works it wouldn't work there's
a reason that big companies don't do
this either if a big company takes over
a small company do you think they say
well it might take us 10 years to get it
done but we're going to use a scalpel do
you know what happens when you try to
use a
scalpel the people you try to scalpel
will tell you that won't work all right
managers I just took over this entity or
I'm Doge uh I don't know all the details
of what you guys do so can you tell me
where the cuts will be with the scalpel
CU you know I don't have time to learn
like all the Nuance of your specific
department and then the department
manager says well we're actually
underfunded by
30% so you can't really make a cut here
and then you come back to them and you
say no but everybody's got to make a cut
we're just going to do it with the
scalpel and then the person says really
well there's nothing to
scalpel okay but give me a list of
things we could cut out with a scalpel
all right uh you're going to have to
give me a month a month
yeah because I have to look at all the
things we're doing talk to everybody
really dig in and make sure we're using
the right
scalpel all right and then a month later
they come in and go well we looked at
everything there was nothing to cut
turns out we just need 30% more money
what do you do with that van Jones what
do you do with
that if you don't think that's what
would happen you've never worked in the
real world here's what works how much
money do we give you uh 100 billion a
year all right now you have
50 that's it any nothing else works
there there's nobody who's ever made
anything work but that and then
everybody screams and quits and resigns
and protests right and then you check
back in a year and everything's working
with half as much
money it it's the same thing everywhere
all the time all over the world all
through space and time only one thing
works you have less money deal with it
everything else is just a bunch of
people with scalpel
lying here's my scalpel I'm getting
ready to cut some some only the only the
fat I won't get any
muscle won't work anywhere in the real
world and I don't believe anybody except
somebody who's a lifelong pundit would
ever imagine the scalpel could work it's
so removed from any kind of common sense
now if you don't believe
me I would recommend that you check in
with people who really know how any of
this works such as Elon Musk literally
the world expert at cutting the
fat it you know before he did Doge if
you were going to say all right who
would be the best person to do this you
would have said Elon
Musk and then as soon as he starts doing
it and doing it exactly the way any
smart person would who had a lot of
experience everybody is like Wella I've
got a better idea I'm way smarter than
Elon Musk is well if he's using a
chainsaw then I say whatever is the
opposite of that the opposite of a
chainsaw is a
scalpel and I I saw you know Chris ala
and talking to Chris gr on news
nation and uh ciza who used to be a CNN
political pundit he was warning that the
Democrats their intense hatred of trump
is crippling their odds or reclaiming
things because if all they're doing is
saying Trump bad Trump bad they're not
really creating any positive
alternative but they also Point paint
themselves in a in a
corner
um so what was it uh yeah so and by the
way I like that Chris guomo seems to
completely understand this
situation um but here's my take on
it once you've once you've spent years
just years saying that Trump is Hitler
oh we we mean it like actual Hitler he's
he's totally Hitler no not not just a
metaphor not just an analogy but we we
mean he's
actually uh you know he's actually
Hiller now what happens if that guy
becomes
eled how are you supposed to agree with
some of the things he gets right which
is what you know CA says you should at
least agree with the things that make
sense you
can't let me give you an
example he's Hitler but we have to admit
he has some excellent ideas
too in what world does that
work as soon as you say the character is
Hitler there's nothing you can say this
sounds like you agree with them it's
like well okay yeah sure he's Hitler but
have to admit that his crost cutting is
going well you can't do
that Hitler is is yes no and once they
put themselves in yes no
category it's got to be no it's got to
be no to everything all the time because
you know Hitler so they tra themselves
in a way that's hilariously impossible
to escape under the condition that you
know Trump became president which they
would I guess they didn't see
coming so they had a great play unless
he got elected and then it would destroy
the entire Democrat Party and it looks
like that's what's
happened um ABC News continues to be ABC
News and uh they recently had a article
about the LA fires and they said uh
among the hardest hit in the LA fires
were the transgender and non-binary
residents in transitional housing
programs
now uh I have great empathy for anybody
who lost anything in the LA fires but
did we really need to call out this one
community and again I'm I'm completely
supportive of any adults who want to do
anything they want with whether they're
you know transgender non-binary lgbtq
and any way they want totally in favor
of it I like people being people we
should all be free to you know express
ourselves and whatever feels right to us
and you can change your mind anytime you
want as far as I'm concerned
but were they do we really need to call
them out as among the hardest hit by the
fire I've talked to some people who are
hard hit by the fire they're not too
happy believe it or not not too happy
even though they're not transgender in
every single
case anyway what I really need is uh if
we're going to do fire
reporting based on people's sexual
preferences I'm going to need a diagram
I need a I need to see some ven diagrams
one one ven Circle would be uh people
who lost a house in the fire and then
the other Circle would be penis
preference because you know I like to I
like to see my arguments with data so
give me the vend diagram of how many
people lost a house and we'll cross that
with the circle of how many people have
certain preferences for a
penis and there might be more to it then
we could add some circles if that's not
enough but at the very least when
somebody's house burns down my first
thought is well what what are their
thoughts about
penis do they love
it are they looking to add one to get
rid of one to enjoy one to use one I
mean these are the important questions
about fires I know a lot of people are
going to say oh the real question is how
do we rebuild and how do we make sure it
doesn't happen again okay that's fine
too but really we want to know more
about the victim's preferences for penis
that's the kind of news ABC can bring us
well City Bank has announced that it's
going to get rid of its Dei goals and
policies now unusual Wales is reporting
this on X I don't know exactly if
abandoning it is ever real because it
feels a lot like all they ever do is
change the names because they can't
really say we stop caring you know about
diversity that's not going to fly
internally so doesn't it really mean
they're just going to hide it better
we don't
know but that's what I'd
assume uh George Clooney continues to be
extra extra worthless uh outside of
acting I love his movies so you know
within the within the realm of
hollywooding stuff I enjoy his work I
I'll watch more of it um but he conceded
I guess in a Thursday interview with the
New York Times he conceded that uh
the media he says the media failed us uh
in his coverage of Biden's Fitness for
office the media failed us what does
this remind you of reminds me a little
bit of Mayor Karen bass who is putting
together an investigation to find out
why she went to Africa instead of
handling the
fires she's looking for the real killer
it's a little like OJ looking for the
real killer
if your actor George Clooney and you
knew for sure that Biden didn't have it
together and you noticed that the that
the news wasn't handling it and you knew
that if you wrote about it it would be
the
news George you are the news everything
you say is the news including this
interview where you talk about the
unfitness of the news the news printed
you saying that the news failed he can
get he can get the news to print
anything if if he could get the news to
print that the news failed he certainly
could have gotten the news to print uh I
know Joe Biden and you really need to
back off of this he's uh he's not where
you need him to be they would have
reported that do you think there's any
do you think there's any
chance that if Clooney had broken ranks
they would have ignored it there's no
chance of that at all he had the
complete power complete power to make
that not a problem he could have
actually probably gotten you know at
least a better contest uh if people had
listened to him early although probably
would have ended up being con Harrison
unless they unless they took him out
really
early
um anyway let's compare that to how
Republicans have treated U Mitch
McConnell's obvious mental infirmities
now with McConnell we don't know exactly
how much is mental and how much is
physical because it's it's pretty
overlapping but in your experience has
anybody gone easy on Mitch
McConnell have you seen any Republicans
who said stop bothering Mitch McConnell
he's perfectly fine I don't see a
problem with him what do you see what
well you crazy Putin puppet you must be
a Putin puppet if you say that Mitch
McConnell looks fine who who says that
nobody so for the longest time the
minute that that McConnell walked on
stage and looked mentally
degraded what
happened I'll tell you what happened
every single Republican said okay that's
a problem in public we said it in public
many times okay that's a problem we you
need to we need to get rid of that
that's that's our problem so so I feel
though I feel like the Republicans do a
level of self- policing that just
doesn't happen on the other side like it
it felt like you know somebody took a
dump on our you know on our
carpet you know and I think if that
happened to the Democrats they'd be
looking for the real
pooper whereas the Republicans are like
oh wow look at that on my carpet I
better clean that up right
away we clean up our messes or at least
we admit their
messes uh it seems like now I could be
this could be a totally biased take I'm
completely aware of that but doesn't it
seem like doesn't it feel like at least
the Trump version of the Republican
Party the prot Trump doesn't it feel
like there's like real self-
policing and it just doesn't exist on
the other side it feels that
way but it's more of a
feeling
um and then uh let's see if Clooney has
some good solid takes about uh Trump's
policies or do you imagine that he might
have some takes that are based on
imagination and interpretive
dance let's see what he says uh about
Trump he said that uh no rules count
anymore Clooney said of trump it's like
letting an infant walk across the 405
freeway in the middle of the
afternoon okay what which policy did he
just
address I don't see one he also said I
think there are always these pendulum
swings the first Trump election was I
believe a result of eight years of a
black
president
really yeah
really does anybody think that if the
last eight years had been president
let's say Byron Donald or Tim
Scott do you think that Trump would have
been elected because we had eight years
of a black
president do Democrats really
think that it what that was his skin
color and not the things he
did do you really think that if a
republican black candidate became
president then that would be a reason
for
Republicans to vote for a White Guy next
time I mean you know maybe three or four
people but that's such a weird
take by the way I'm So Pro Byron Donald
I I love just his his uh not just his
Vibe but his I guess I guess I'd say
Charisma but his uh his communication
skills we can't ignore that he his
ability to communicate is just way above
the average
Republican that if he's not in the fight
for the top job fairly soon maybe maybe
he needs to get a little more seasoned
but I don't know I think you'd be pretty
happy with that that kind of a voice on
your
side so it's premature anything could
change but at the moment a very high
opinion
so I'd like to uh I'd like to give you
George Clooney's opinions uh in
interpretive
dance no rules count
anymore it's like letting an infant walk
across the
405 it's like there's these pendulum
swings we can't let the 8 years of a
black
president there that's that's my
interpretive
dance
version let's see uh CNN is uh telling
some fake news about Pete Heth allegedly
making deep Cuts in the Pentagon now I
do suspect there will be some eventual
deep Cuts in the Pentagon but apparently
what Heth is doing is moving existing
funding from one bucket to another so
he's taking it away
from uh climate
initiatives how could anybody be against
this how could anybody be against the
Pentagon moving money from their climate
initiative to building a Iron Dome to
protect the United States from incoming
missiles but boy those two things are
not similar but CNN will call that as a
deep
cut there might be deep Cuts coming but
that that's not right
away um
there are four new polls showing that
the public's opinion of trump handling
of the economy is
turned uh according to
CNN so there's new CNN pole gaple ipsos
and
cupac now what do we believe about
polls how many of you believe polls are
real now I don't want to cast any
aspersions on any particular pollster
or or particular poll but I don't
believe they're real there there was a
time I figured well if there's four of
them you know and they're the same
direction they're probably
real now I also don't necessarily think
they're wrong because uh America is dumb
enough that they would say it's been a
month and you haven't fixed the economy
yet that would be something that
Americans would say I don't know it's
been a whole month my price of eggs went
up so you said you lower and it's been a
month so it's
possible it's and by the way if they did
the poll it means they were probably
polling last
week so they might have been polling his
performance after three weeks on the
job um before you even had like is the
people approved and N the nominations
approved
uh so just in general let me say this
when polls can be validated meaning they
can be compared to the
reality I think they're usually um as
accurate as the pollsters can make them
so for example for every poll polling
company that was doing polls um for the
election I believe their last poll each
of their last poll so the one that was
closest to election day I believe they
all had an incentive because that was
the day you could find out if they were
way off or not uh that was the only time
they had any incentive to be accurate
all the other times I believe without
proof they had more incentive to let's
say make some assumptions and some
choices about who to pull and what
method to use they would get them a
let's say an answer that would get them
a lot of attention from the right
people and they wouldn't have anything
to compare it to so if you've got four
poles that are sort of right leaning
just hypothetically or let's say left
leaning hypothetically and they come out
at the same time they kind of have the
same similar you know attack that it
looks like oh Trump suddenly is very
unpopular on the economy you know the
most important
thing do you think that those are just
honest
unrigged professional polls
they could be I have no proof that
they're not no proof at all but I live
in the real
world there's nothing that they're
compared to except each
other and if a uh if a right leading or
let's say a poll that had been
associated with Trump in the past came
out with a different number they'd still
be safe because they'd say oh look at
that fake one from the right but look at
all these real ones from the left cuz
they have more there there are more
polls that you would imagine sort of
lean Democrat so as long as they have
more of them and there's no way to check
the real number because what would you
check it against just the other polls uh
they can make up anything they want and
it's very powerful because it tells the
public what to think so no I don't
believe any poll that is this
disconnected from some objective
standard by which we could find out if
the poll was
real and the only time I know of is what
the last poll before an actual election
and then the actual election if it's
assuming it's not rigged is going to
tell you something like
reality well there's something happening
over in China with the money
supply uh but any numbers coming out of
China or suspect so that's the first
thing um
and we don't know what's happening but
it looks like their M1 money supply just
re just right away just
surged um and it looks like it surged in
a way that's spectacularly different
from the Baseline but again it's China
and data I'm not sure we believe any
data from China um but the suggestion is
that they've got a deflationary problem
and that people are just hoarding their
cash and they're not consuming enough to
drive the economy where it needs to go
so if you got a deflationary problem
maybe injecting it with some stimulus
money that you
printed maybe that's why they're doing
it so we're just guessing at this point
and it's not 100% sure that anything's
happening at all because the data is so
sketchy all right so Mark AR Rubio did
an interview with I think it was
Katherine herriage and he said said that
when he met with zinski seninsky was
sort of a two-faced liar and
uh he he said that when I talked to him
about let's see about maybe the us
sharing in some of their uh some of
their mineral
wealth zalinsky seemed at first sort of
positive about the concept you know at a
concept level but you know he needed to
run it through his legislative process
so he was acting like oh yeah that could
that could be a winning idea then two
days later he's saying he rejected he
rejected the deal not that the
legislative process did but he rejected
it and uh and apparently that's just a
lie so Rubio is just calling him out to
to have been lied about that
and um and uh Ruby was saying there
should be some gratitude there because
you know helping them more than they're
helping us
so
but let's see if we can trust uh Ukraine
well speaking of polls um You probably
heard that uh right after Trump had
claimed that zelinsky's popularity was
about
4% which I've never heard anybody's
popularity being that low ever that
zinsky immediately referred to a poll uh
a more recent poll
that said he had
57% approval well that would be actually
quite impressive for any leader um
57% huh I wonder who did that poll let's
see was it the KV International
Institute of
Sociology yes it was that's who did the
poll were they funded by
usaid well it turns out they were guess
what you USA the the little
uh suay CIA related uh funding entity
that we used to control other countries
allegedly um was behind that polling and
it and it came out at exactly the right
time with a number that suspiciously
looks like it was just made up on the
spot huh how about
that so uh the ma account on X explains
it this way he says he says uh couple
days ago Trump claimed that zinsky is
widely unpopular in Ukraine and that his
approval rating is 4% the very next day
uh the the mainstream media collectively
called Trump a liar and and the
mainstream media in the United States
this is so embarrassing the mainstream
media in the United States uh called
Trump a liar uh as did let's let's see
CNN did ABC CBS and they all quoted that
57% to show that when Trump said 4% I
mean trumps what a what a liar 4% is 57%
people
um so may says uh looked up where the
number came from it came from the KE
International Institute of socialy uh
guess when they released their poll
results it was the day after Trump made
his claim
that doesn't sound too suspicious does
it there there were no poll results that
said that until the day after Trump said
it was four huh how about that I I think
there was a real poll that said 4% and
then there was another real poll that
said
16% now 16 would be devastatingly bad
and who knows if any of the polls are
real so remember what I said about
polls if there's no way to check that
they're real
they're probably not probably not let's
talk about negotiating with
Russia one of the big problems in the
news is that people who write news and
uh talk about news often don't know much
about negotiating so when they watch
Trump negotiating they're seeing
something they've never seen and it's
not the way they would have done it
their assumption is he's doing it
wrong uh Apple removes Cloud encryption
feature oh the UK we'll talk about the
UK in a minute
um so here's what I tried to explain in
a post on X the other day might help you
um so critics of Trump's negotiating
with Russia say that uh you don't start
be giving up giving up on NATO expansion
and giving up on Russia returning the
captured
territories so the smart people who
think they know how negotiating Works
say you don't give up things before you
negotiated it now I agree you don't give
up things before you negotiate everybody
agrees right everybody on the same page
you don't give away
things before you've even started you
might try to get the other side to do it
but you don't do it that would be just a
mistake so the all those smart critics
are saying that Trump is sort of given
up now I don't know how they know this
because nobody knows what anybody's
saying secretly so this is speculation
on their part I would say but they
believe that Trump is giving up on NATO
expansion you know toward Russia and
that that would be just like starting by
giving something up and they think that
there's not going to be any attempt to
get back the territories that are I
guess they're mostly Russians speaking
that that Russia is controlling right
now on the eastern part of Ukraine so is
that an example of trump giving up two
things no it
isn't those are two things that were
never going to
change if you simply acknowledge the
reality and then negotiate from there
you haven't given up
anything there there was no possibility
that the war would end no possibility at
all as long as we were also saying that
we're going to move toward Russia with
uh
NATO since it was the entire reason for
the war in the first place and Russia
apparently still has enough resources to
press the war if they want to why would
they stop if the only reason they
started we said well we're going to keep
doing that thing that caused you to
start the war that that's a
non-starter why would we say that we're
we're going to try to get back those
occupied territories when we know that's
not going to
happen so the first thing you have to do
is acknowledge what's
real what's real is that some things
aren't going to
change but we also have things that are
not going to
change for example if they tried to go
into keev we would probably crush them
and I don't think that's going to
change so there are things that both
sides know are not going to change
if you don't at least be honest about
those things how are you going to
negotiate if we just went in and said
all right number one we're we're going
to keep expanding uh
NATO then what does Russia do they'd say
well why are we talking well we're
negotiating and Russia would say that's
not up for
negotiating all right that's the end of
our negotiations we'll just keep
fighting
now does that allow Putin to take
advantage of let's say Trump's uh
political incentive to make it wrap up
fast maybe but how does Trump compensate
for what looks like giving them
stuff looks like but I don't think it
really is well he expands the
variables so here what you would say is
here's the deal it's not just about
those territories and it's not just
about NATO we're going to make this a
lot bigger it's going to be a bigger
deal and there are going to be things
that America wants even if Ukraine
doesn't there are things that America
wants even if Europe doesn't so we're
going to talk about all the
things once you've seen all the things
you might have a good idea of who gave
up what and what was real and what was
practical and what might work and then
you could have an opinion but at this
point nothing's actually been given up
but there may have been some you you
know just common sense reality it's like
okay if we're going to have this
conversation we know there are some
things that are not not uh
negotiable let let's say for example
that uh Putin had been asking for NATO
to be completely disbanded not just in
Ukraine but just
disbanded would we enter that
negotiation we would
not but suppose Putin said all right I'm
going to accept the fact
that that NATO will never be
disbanded well then you can talk is that
an example of Putin giving us something
for nothing aha he wanted NATO
completely disbanded but he seems to
have already backed off in that before
we even started
negotiating no he didn't give up
anything because it wasn't going to
happen there was no scenario in which
NATO was going to get disbanded so if
you're giving up things that everybody
knows were never really negotiable
all it does is allow you to talk it
looks like that's what Trump's doing
he's just being reasonable about the
things that are negotiable and
reasonable about the things that are not
negotiable and if you don't have some
common sense approach to what's real you
can't negotiate
anything so it's way too early to say
it's going to work or not work we have
to see all the variables and it could be
it could be there might be some secret
variables meaning that the public might
not see the entire agreement for example
one of the things we might want long
term is that Russia takes our side if we
have some let say uh Islamic extremist
problem maybe maybe we could use their
help suppose we want their help uh
making sure that something good happens
you know in the Middle East just in
general maybe there's a secret agreement
maybe we want to make sure that uh we
drive a wedge between Russia and China
so that if things got really bad Russia
would feel a little more likely to
thrive if they're on our side I don't
know if we'd say that
publicly so we're not going to really
necessarily see all the variables that
went into Whatever Gets agreed on if
something gets agreed on
all right
um so in my opinion you want to be uh
and here's the other thing you want to
be complimentary to Putin and treat him
like a serious peer that's the only way
he's going to make a deal and same same
the other way if Putin were treating U
Trump like he's Hiller how would they
get a
deal Trump would even talk to him if
Trump were treating Putin like he was
Hiller why would Putin meet with him
they never get a deal so it makes
complete sense that Trump would be
complimenting Putin at the same time
he's giving some tough
criteria um if he complimented them and
then also gave away everything that
would be bad if he compliments Putin so
that we don't have a problem with just
let's say the Egos and The Branding of
things just take that off the table and
just work on the
details then it's going to look good as
long as the America gets what it
wants that that's going to look good but
would you treat Putin and zalinski the
same in this context and the answer is
no I wouldn't treat them the
same I I would treat zalinski as an
underling who depends on us for
everything and I would treat Putin as a
peer that's what I would do
so slapping zalinski basically in public
which is what Trump did with his 4%
approval is actually the exact right
approach he should be treating Putin our
enemy with respect because that's how
you might get a deal and zalinski is not
really playing well as a team member and
if you're a terrible team member you get
benched so zinski gets
benched Putin's still the opponent but
we're treating it with a respect because
that's how you get to the other side if
you if you really want to be effective
that's how you get
there all right and I I like to say that
as good as Trump is at
negotiating um I think Putin has the
right persuasion and negotiating skills
that it's a fair fight I still think
Trump is the best but it's definitely a
fair fight there there are similar
weight class when it comes to you know
overall negotiating and and
persuading so we'll see what comes to
that uh
meanwhile uh apparently the UK has
asked asked Apple to uh open up a back
door to their cloud service so that what
the UK could see everything anybody's
ever done on their
phone uh and I just saw something go by
that says that Apple agreed to that
now I always assume that our own
government has full access to the back
doors of all of our phones it's sort of
an easy
assumption but I don't know why the UK
needs it and and maybe I guess I'm
surprised they didn't already have it
I'm a little surprised they didn't have
a back door so uh here's my big
question you know we Russia are uh enemy
we keep saying and the UK is our
Ally but it seems like the UK was
suspiciously involved in the Russia
collusion
hoax or at least one of their you know x
uh intelligence people
steel so and and they had some other
connections to it so I thought to myself
huh it kind of looks like the UK tried
to overthrow the government of the
United States
and then of course there's the whole
censorship thing coming out of Europe
and Great Britain in particular and I
thought wait a minute these are our
allies and they're trying to destroy
Free Speech via destroying the platforms
free speech in the United States if
you're going after free speech that's
worse
than anything I know of that Russia did
when did Russia go after our Free Speech
there was one time they sent $200,000
worth of uh bad memes in 2016 that made
no difference to anything and I think
that was pran's shop and and Putin
actually killed that guy the guy who
sent those memes Putin murdered him for
other
reasons um so I'm not making the case
that you know Russia is all good and
there are friends I'm I'm making the uh
comparison that if the UK can't act
better than our known
enemy um I'm going to have a trouble
treating one of them as an ally and one
of them as an enemy if if Great Britain
is going after or even in any way going
after our privacy or our free
speech I don't really call that an ally
I would call that an enemy by definition
in fact anybody who tries to curtail
free speech in America is My Enemy by
definition
so you know obviously I'm going to you
know give some Grace to anybody who's a
historical Ally but I think they have
some explaining to do and I think the UK
needs to explain why in the future we
should be their Ally it's it's becoming
less and less clear that
they're a productive Ally they might be
such an unproductive Ally that they're
doing worse things to us than our actual
enemies
that's entirely
possible
anyway uh let's talk about the rest of
the world so Gaza returned uh some
bodies but they did it in the worst
possible way one of the bodies they said
they would give apparently was not there
um and they made a big parade cheering
spectacle about the dead
bodies so big cheering spectacle
um so the US Envoy uh for this Adam
bowler he said that Hamas failing to
turn over the body of one of the
hostages uh is a clear violation of the
ceasefire and he advised toas to release
that one body that they said they would
give but also release everybody or
they're going to be face total
Annihilation and right
now now I don't know how much total
Annihilation will happen right now
because of this but I'll tell you Gaza
is making it really
easy for Israel to do what it probably
thinks it needs to do which is never
populate Gaza again with anybody who was
there
before so Egypt has this plan for Gaza
and it's
hilariously
bad so have you noticed that all the
plans for Gaza they always start with
one magical part there's a magical part
all right here here's Egypt's plan you
tell me what the magical part is so the
Egyptian lead plan uh it was set up
temporary safe zones within Gaza safe
zones and then but Hamas would not be
invited into the safe
zones that's the first magical
part uh how do you keep Hamas out of the
Zone full of Hamas supporters that's not
a
thing if if you if you had some way to
keep homas out you'd be reading mines or
you you'd be talking about a completely
different public the people who are
cheering the dead
bodies were not necessarily
Hamas they might have been your regular
people as well so if you've got 5
million
people uh the Gins who had been
brainwashed for
years that they needed to be you know
brutal on
Israel uh can you keep just the Hamas
people out of the safe Zone that's just
pure magical thinking the magical
thinking is all right imagine that
instead of the residents of Gaza being
exactly who they are you know a
brainwashed weaponized public let's
imagine that they're not those
people and then I've got a solution for
you and then I say oh but wait they're
not really the the people who were going
to just never go back to the Hamas way
of
life it was very much a preference and
they probably have twice as many reasons
to do it now because Gaza got
flattened
so uh and then they say uh you know the
Arab states would kick in 20 billion
that might be possible and then they
want a Palestinian Administration that's
not aligned with Hamas or the
Palestinian author
Authority
really do you think there's a
Palestinian Administration that they
could find that would be acceptable to
the residents of Gaza because I think
that's important that would have no
connection with Hamas or the Palestinian
Authority these are pure magical
thoughts it's like they're not really
even trying are they it's just magical
thinking um so so they start with all
right imagine if the Gins had not been
brainwashed since
birth now I've got a
solution but they have been brainwashed
since
birth well let's imagine they're not and
then we can solve it but but hold
on you can't just imagine a different
reality well maybe I
can the the Ridiculousness of the
alternative plans are are just so
striking anyway yeah good luck keeping
Hamas and of the safe
Zone
meanwhile um in Mexico president Shin
bomb of
Mexico uh said uh about the possibility
of the US you know going in military
militarily after the cartels what we
want to make clear with this designation
that the designation that the cartels
are terrorists what we want to make
clear with this designation is that we
do not negotiate
sovereignty this can't be an opportunity
by the United States to invade our
sovereignty they can call cartels
whatever they decide but with Mexico it
is collaboration and coordination never
subordination no interference and even
less
Invasion all right let me explain some
things to
Mexico and I hate to break it to you
Mexico uh but your sovereignty doesn't
mean a thing to
us just want to be clear your
sovereignty is just some you care
about we don't care about that you know
what I care about the death coming
across the border from your country I
don't care about your sovereignty and if
I have enough of a military to ignore
your sovereignty it just isn't part of
the
conversation if we need to your
sovereign means nothing to us nothing we
don't respect it don't recognize it
don't care if you had sovereignty you
would have prevented the cartels from
essentially running the country you
don't have any
sovereignty maybe the cartels have some
sovereignty but you've got none and if
you think you do it's just in your mind
and certainly has nothing to do with
what US policy will be period That's
that's not
negotiable um so let me let me just
break it down into the simplest way just
some questions is there a problem for
the
US uh that's that's arriving from Mexico
in other words is Mexico causing the us
to have a big deadly problem yes yes the
answer is yes is Mexico a addressing
that problem on their own in an
effective way no nobody thinks it
they're doing
is there any chance any chance at all
that Mexico will address it effectively
on their
own no nobody thinks that so say goodbye
to your
sovereignty you just sacrificed it your
sovereignty means you take care of your
 if you can't take care of your own
 you don't have
sovereignty and there's trouble coming
your way that's just the way the real
world Works
sorry well Spotify says it's going to
now allow AI narrated uh audio books on
their s according to Digital Trends and
Drew taranto's
writing and apparently this would
increase the number of books on Spotify
and the way that they are allowing it is
they'll allow this one AI company 11
labs to be the ones who create your
audiobook now it's pretty expensive
because if you use if you're an author
and you use 11 Labs it can be you know
one of their subscriptions the
professional one is pretty expensive
it's over $1,000 a month um now here's
what I
wonder wouldn't an audio book be
instantly stolen and pirated and put in
the public domain the minute you put it
on
Spotify now I don't know if that's as
easy if
you had it on an Amazon platform because
the Amazon audiobooks I think there's
some you know some kind of encryption or
something uh but I don't know about
Spotify if you just put it on Spotify
the one thing I do like is that you
could pretty much instantly have it in
as many languages as you
want but it does feel like just giving
your book away because if there's an
audio file that anybody can copy could
they just downloaded as they're playing
it how does that work I don't know if
but if I make an audio book using Ai and
just upload it to Spotify it feels like
it would take about one second for
somebody to download it and
just start making it available on other
platforms so it seems like a mess from
the author's perspective but I might do
it you know it's
also I think the days of audiobooks and
books may be over in general because AI
is going to take so much of that that I
don't know I don't even know if
Publishers can survive in the future
doesn't seem like
it the Russia Ukraine war is entirely
the fault of NATO Chuck
says well people who don't know how
anything starts are are always
difficult difficult to talk to them but
I I used the Poke the bear analogy
yesterday
you know you can blame the bear for
killing you but if you were poking the
bear with a stick you're not entirely
innocent you know if you knew the bear
would do it and you poked him with a
stick is it really the Bear's
fault all right it is the Bear's fault
but all right I'm just looking at some
of your comments um ladies and gentlemen
that's I have for you today happy Friday
tomorrow will be the weekend maybe
tonight will be the weekend uh thanks
for joining and I'm going to talk to the
uh locals people privately let's see if
our technology is allowing me to do that
today and for rest of you I'll see you
tomorrow same time same place and locals
only in 30
seconds
