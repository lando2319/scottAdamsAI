well
today is going to be a barn burner what
a show we have
oh my god it's going to be so good
i'm excited and all you need to enjoy it
to its maximum potential as a copper bug
or a glass a tanker chelsea steiner
canteen jugger flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine to the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
and it's going to be on fire today fire
i tell you
go
well if twitter is telling me the truth
and why wouldn't it
at least people on twitter it looks like
facebook has uh
upheld the suspension of trump on
facebook
so trump will not be on facebook
i guess they have some semi-independent
board that makes this decision to
cover their butts but here's a question
i ask
who still uses facebook
i swear to god i just don't know who
uses it
do you you know i have an account
and i do check it but
i feel that of the people i know
know five percent actually post things
and i don't know anybody who's let's say
teenager or younger who uses facebook at
all
how could facebook survive if teenagers
aren't using it at all
i don't know i don't think the story
here is trump is not on facebook the
story might be
why is anybody on facebook like i don't
even know the point of it
honestly it's uh i think
i think it's it's already past its uh
prime i mean isn't it is there anything
that you need facebook for
all right um i know there are some
businesses that require it but
i i can't believe well i'm just gonna
say it
you know one of my bs filters is when
observation
doesn't match data now
perfect situation is that the world you
observe and the data about that world
seem very compatible
but my observation is that
people aren't using facebook nearly as
much as
the data would suggest so there's a
mystery here
don't know what it is could be just my
observations
propaganda alert
there's a story in the new york times it
says
this judge amy berman-jackson
says that bill barr misled
this letter on how his justice
department viewed
trump's actions now this was about the
mueller report etc
now here's the propaganda part of this
so the headlines
and the summary of the story is that
barr
is a big old liar and he lied about the
mueller report
now here's your assignment try to read
the article
that says bar lied and figure out what
the lie was
because i feel as if they wrote it
to make it really hard to figure out
what's going on
when it should have been really easy it
should have been this is what he said
this is what you know was true
isn't the story about a lie or a series
of lies the easiest story to tell
here's what he said here's what's true
see how they're different and yet
it's written in this really confusing
way where you'll see the headline
and you'll absorb the fact that he lied
and you'll get lost in the writing and
you'll never
quite see the argument for what he lied
about
or any you know mitigating argument
about why maybe he thinks it wasn't a
lie
so i would call that pure propaganda
just the way it's being presented
so be alert for that all right uh here's
the uh
the first provocative part of my
live stream at least today i'm going to
tell you my decision process
for vaccination or no vaccination stop
stop i know what you're thinking i'm not
going to tell you you should get
vaccinated
is that what you thought get your hand
away from the cancel button
i'm not going to tell you you should get
vaccinated that's for you to decide
you your doctor whoever but the last
person you want to listen to
would be me can we get on the same side
on that
before you start disagreeing with me
because there's going to be plenty of
that
all right so let's just let's agree on
the part we agree on don't take your
medical advice from me
but here's what i would suggest you can
take away from
this you can take away a way of looking
at it
compare it to your own way of looking at
it and see if there's anything in my way
of looking at it
that would give you a little way to fix
up your own way of looking at it
also look at the comments to anything i
say next
because there may be some experts who
weigh in and say scott
you got this wrong in a number of ways
so
keep in mind that we're all dealing with
incomplete information
right wouldn't it be great if we had
great information so how do you make a
decision
in a realm in which your information is
incomplete
well that's what i'm going to help you
with today for those of you who are new
to me
i'm mostly known as a dilbert cartoonist
guy
but i also have a degree in economics uh
years of
cost benefit analyses in corporate
worlds
on lots of complicated decisions i've
got an mba
and so risk management and cost benefit
decisions
is my expertise for more than cartooning
but i'm not a health expert so your own
decision
should come from looking at the the
mechanism for making the decision
and then putting in your own estimates
all right so i'm going to show you my
own
personal estimates yours should be
different
and therefore your overall decision
could also be quite different
using the same structure so here's where
i started with just
a little background uh these are the
different ways you could get some
immunity
you got the modern and pfizer um
vaccinations that's the
the two vaccination deals the newer
technology
and these are the strongest longest
lasting
protections you also have the j and j
one which is one shot
but also natural immunity let's say
you'd already had the coronavirus
these two will give you probably good
enough
protection it might not be as strong on
paper
as the the top two choices
but it will be strong enough to probably
reduce your odds of dying
from the next exposure to the
coronavirus
probably pretty close to zero so all of
these
are probably in the good enough range
and you probably won't get a choice
anyway
but if you did get a choice just know
that there's
some difference here it might not be a
difference
that matters to your death rate though
so if you just take the two choices get
vaccinated or
don't get vaccinated and i will look at
your a look at your comments
after i do this so if you have some good
comments just wait till i'm ready to
read them
my personal odds of death
personal odds of death this is where you
put in your own number
so your assumption about your own risks
should be based on your comorbidity your
weight
your your gender your ethnicity
apparently um and you know all the all
the obvious stuff
so my personal estimate is that if i
were to get vaccinated
my odds of death from coronavirus
and by odds of death from the
vaccination itself
basically round to zero you know is
something way less than one percent
right
so when things are so much less than one
percent
i treat them as zero so in terms of
decision making
it might be true that this risk or this
risk is
five times more than the other one but
they're both
zero for all practical purposes
somebody says can't be zero in practical
sense
you can treat it as zero that's
different from being zero
so in a decision making
context you can treat some things as
zero even though you know it's
a little bit more than zero so so work
with me on this right
so i think that whether i get the
vaccination or i don't my odds of dying
from a vaccination or from the virus
basically zero now remember this is my
personal odds
we're not talking about what happens to
large populations
that's separate what are my odds of
getting infected
well even if you get the vaccination
apparently you can get reinfected
but i do think that the weight of
common sense and logic about this is
that you have a much less chance of
getting
infected if you've got the vaccination
still can happen
so i'm just going to put in a number and
this might be high
and you might want to put in your own
number so again
don't judge me by what numbers i put in
for myself
because that's none of your business you
put in your own numbers
and that's none of my business do you
get that
i want everybody to be clear i'm not
telling you to get vaccinated or not
i'm telling you to make up your own
decision by putting in your own
estimates
all right i think if i don't get
vaccinated based on
how well i can socially distance and
what my activities are likely to be
maybe
maybe as much as a 20 chance of getting
infected
but what are the risk of the long-haul
or
let's say long-term complications and
when i say long-haul i'm going to say
that let's say you get the vaccination
and somewhere
down the line there's some kind of
complication that you didn't know about
what are the odds of that well my
understanding
is that the nature of vaccines according
to the experts
is that if you're going to have a
problem you almost always
have that problem right away meeting the
first
weeks first months uh there there's very
little if any
history of getting a vaccination and
then
you know five years later somebody's got
a problem at least
for this type of vaccination at least
according to the experts
do you believe them no way to know is
there
so this is the problem we don't have any
certainty about any of this stuff
so you have to make your own best guess
and
that's the best you can do i'm going to
say
that the odds of getting a vaccination
and then years in the future having a
side effect
really small i don't know how small
but just for the purposes of making
decisions less than one percent
am i right how would i know
i'm just saying that things like this
vaccinations
are in a class of risks in which the
long-term risk
is way way smaller than your risk of
something happening in the first few
weeks
and even the risk of having something
happening in the first few weeks
is really really small okay so
i discount them to something less than
one percent
but if you don't get the vaccination
there is at least one study
again it's just one study who knows how
accurate that is
that said that maybe up to 30 percent of
people who get the virus
have some kind of long-haul problem now
long haul means it could last months
but do you believe that if you had a
problem that made you mentally foggy
for nine months which is a real thing
this is happening to people
do you think that's not permanent
because we don't know that it's
permanent but i can't imagine
anything that let's say at my current
age right because it'd be worse
the older you are but at my current age
if i had nine months of brain fog
do you really think i'm going to come
out the other end just as healthy
i can't believe it but i also don't have
evidence
one way or another whether it's
temporary or permanent but this is the
one i worry about
so i put about zero credibility in my
odds of dying
personally just personally but i think
my odds of having some long-haul
brain fog that is the scariest part
pretty good now what about the
miscellaneous unknown
risks how do you handle them one of the
miscellaneous unknown risks
is what if bill gates put a microchip
in your vaccines i rate the
value of that in my decision making at
zero
zero we'll talk about therapeutics uh
because it's a it's a wild and crazy
thing and
every decision every decision has all
you know a whole bunch of things that
could happen
it could happen you couldn't get hit by
a meteor
you could explode spontaneously there's
lots of stuff that could happen
but i value them all at zero as a
decision-making
standard and i would suggest this for
you as well
now every situation is different but if
you have this wild well
maybe something could go wrong but
there's no data to it and you don't have
experts worried about it
in the situation where experts aren't
terribly worried
and they and they do to understand the
the realm
i give a zero what about the risk of
long-term complications like i said
probably less than one percent but not
zero certainly not zero
and what about uh what kind of weight do
you put on
peace of mind well this again
is individual some of you might have
better peace of mind
by not getting vaccinated and peace of
mind
that counts right that's a real thing
it matters to your quality of life so if
you think that
getting the vaccination would make you
panicked for years that it might have
some
side effect well take that into account
my personal anecdotal experience
was that getting the first of the two
shots i got the moderna
but getting the first made me feel
better
not worse so in my mind both my rational
mind and
i guess my irrational mind as well i
feel
and it's just a feeling right because we
don't know
the risks exactly it's just the feeling
i feel safer
i feel safer now would you
would you feel safer getting a
vaccination
if you wouldn't then maybe
maybe you take that into consideration i
wasn't sure i would
but i do it's it's unambiguous in my
case but i can't guarantee that would
happen to you
the other thing is the social good so
there's one thing to make a decision
that is good for you
and you have every right every right
morally ethically just completely
to just make a decision that's right for
you without any regard
to what it might mean to anybody else's
health you have
every right to do that right
just as you have every right to not join
the military but we do give respect to
people who do
because we know that people who do join
the military are taking on an extra risk
and a big part of that is for the
benefit of
of other people strangers people they've
never met other americans
so this is one of these rare cases where
people
like me and your situation could be
completely different
so this should not influence your
decision but i've had a good run
meaning you know i've reached a certain
age and
if i died tomorrow
uh you know taking uh taking on some
risk that might have
been you know in a small way beneficial
to the country
i'm okay with that i feel that's a
that's a risk that
i'm willing to take if you were really
young maybe you would weight things
differently you'd have more years to
live than i do
so your your cost benefit is a little
bit different but in my case
i did not join the military i did not
serve the country
in in that way which i respect but
here's a situation where i can um be
part of
maybe reducing the spread maybe i'm a
small part of
making it safer to go out to eat if
you're not vaccinated
you know maybe i can make it safer for
those of you who don't want to get
vaccinated
i count that as something useful now how
much weight you give that
totally personal completely personal uh
decision now somebody asked about
therapeutics what about therapeutics
um the problems with therapeutics are
availability do you actually have
availability
of i know some of you think ivermectin
works some of you think
hydroxychloroquine works i'm not a
doctor i'm not promoting
either of those for any reason
whatsoever i'm just saying that some of
you have asked me about them
i don't know that you would have the
availability i don't know that you would
know to start early enough
and i don't know what their risk profile
is relative to the vaccinations
i think they're all such a low risk that
doing any one of them is probably
pretty close to zero risk
yes if you get the vaccine it doesn't
mean that you can't
get the virus again which is what i
indicated on my board there
all right so i would say that your your
therapeutic decision
you should treat somewhat separately if
you're not going to get the vaccination
well maybe you think a little bit more
about the therapeutics
and if you do get the vaccination maybe
that's one less thing you have to worry
about
all right is everybody okay
with the way i've described this and not
giving you any pressure to change your
mind
that's not my deal and you shouldn't
take any medical advice from me
but if it helps you think about it
differently that's all i was trying to
do
all right do you want to get weird
you want to get weird come on let's get
weird
all right um i've told you about this
thing called
affirmations before where you just focus
on
something you want to to happen to your
life something good
it's better to have a general
affirmation such as
wealth or finding love or
you know being healthy that sort of
thing as opposed to being too specific
as in i'll get this specific promotion
and of course this is related
or might be to the idea that we live in
a simulation
or the idea that our reality is
subjective
which i'm going to argue today is not
really too different
from living in a simulation now the
simulation idea is that there's some
entity or intelligence that programmed
us
and we're basically software but we
don't know it
so that's what the simulation assumes
but
suppose that's not the case exactly but
rather there's some base reality
but we're we're not evolved enough to
see it
so we think we can interact with a real
reality
but really we just all have little
movies in our head
that are the reality for us for all
practical purposes
so although these are different ideas
they're not so different
because they both require an
intelligence
that's creating an artificial world one
is in
a computer one is in your mind
but your mind is basically just a moist
computer
so i'm going to treat them as though
they're a little bit similar
because it's a good way to make my point
about affirmations
now if we're in a simulation or and
here's the fun part
or if we just live in a subjective
reality
that has some base to it but we don't
have access to it
in either case we might be able to
program it
through affirmations now this is just a
hypothesis
and it's just for fun right don't take
any of this too seriously
it's just a different filter on the
world i'm going to tell you about a
little
experience after i give you a little
more context
if we're a simulation or a subjective
reality
in both cases there's probably some
computer
risk constraints your brain is only
going to be able to hold so many things
and
a computer only has so much so much
memory so
you would have code reuse which is
certain patterns you would see over and
over again
now would those patterns
start to be more common in other words
would you see more coincidences and more
more reused patterns as the simulation
gets
populated and filled up and the capacity
gets constrained
well i think you would naturally and so
you would start
cutting corners to save resources so you
would reuse ideas
reuse code reuse patterns to create your
simulated reality
you would also if you had computer
restraint constraints you wouldn't ever
see any good pictures of aliens
because you don't really need any aliens
it would be extra
you don't want to build a whole world of
aliens that nobody's ever going to see
that would be a waste of resources so i
don't think we'll ever see real
aliens it makes sense that the universe
is
finite in size your brain can't
understand that
it makes no sense but we do know
that the universe is expanding and
therefore at any moment it's a finite
size
how does that even make sense it only
makes sense
for a simulation because the the
simulation has to
constrain how much resources it uses
uh and then this is just for fun doesn't
it seem like there are too many houses
for how many people there are if you
were going to build a simulation
you wouldn't put people in the houses
if people are just going to drive by and
not see them you would have lots of
empty houses
because it would seem as though they
were populated but it would be the
lowest
resource way to create the impression of
a large
population without having to program
lots of people
there would just be lots of houses now
if you've ever noticed that your
neighborhood seems to have way more
houses
or homes or apartments then there are
people walking around
well maybe you live in a simulation
again if you're just joining this is
just for fun don't take it
too seriously all right what would you
see
if if the patterns are being reused and
there's a resource
problem you'd see more coincidences
right
have you noticed an acceleration of
coincidences
lately i want to say in the comments if
anybody's noticed this
in your own life have you seen an
acceleration
of patterns being reused just recently
like the last year or two and
coincidences
look at the comments now you see a lot
of no's
but look how many yeses there are all
right now that's probably confirmation
bias right
probably you're just noticing it but
maybe there's no
greater coincidence than ever but
if we're a simulation you would sort of
expect to see more coincidences just
because of code reuse and
pattern reuse so i have this hypothesis
that you can author the simulation
just by affirmations it doesn't mean
that you have to write it down
or chant it or do anything you just have
to focus on what you want
and put your intentions very clearly
into the universe
and as long as there's nobody who has
the opposite intention
who's trying to you know program things
the other way
maybe you get what you want so christina
and i
here's the freaky party ready
we did an experiment in the past few
weeks
and the experiment was to see if we
could use uh
affirmations to just focus on an
intention
for free money to appear to us
now by free money i mean something that
we didn't plan
or something that wouldn't be part of my
normal work
so for example if somebody had offered
me a let's say a book
contract that wouldn't count because
that's sort of my normal
my normal routine is that i get
contracts i don't always know when
they're coming
i was i'm talking about a weird money
from nothing
like just magic money that just appears
that's what we were affirming so we
started doing this and a few days later
my
publisher my syndication company says uh
you know your contract that we've had
for 10 years is running out
and the new contract specifies that
you'll get a signing bonus
and we're going to give you this bunch
of money
and i thought well i had no idea that
was coming
and it happened just days just a few
days
after we started this experiment and
sure enough this little
unexpected pile of money came my way but
i said to myself ah
i don't know if this counts because it
was in the contract
it was you know i didn't know about it
but it was something i did to make it
happen right
it's something i negotiated years ago or
actually negotiated recently
and so we said let's just keep going
because that one doesn't count
right yeah that one doesn't count so
then i get an
email just days later just a few days
later i get an email
also from my syndication company saying
that
they couldn't remember if they told me
but
they noticed in the contract that after
10 years there was a guaranteed
true up number meaning that if some
goals were not met
they would owe me a large amount of
money and they had already wired it to
me
so that i wouldn't be surprised that a
large amount of money appeared in my
bank
no idea i had no idea
that 10 years ago i had negotiated so
cleverly
that under these conditions that
happened
i would get a large pile of money does
that count
nope not going to count it not going to
count it
because i negotiated that right i just
forgot about it
so that's not really magic is it that's
just something i forgot about
kind of a coincidence so that's like two
coincidences
but i would say we don't count those
so i said to christina let's not count
those let's just keep going
we'll just try to make some really weird
magic money up here
yesterday i decided to uh
sign up for uh coinbase
and realize that i'd already signed up
before now coinbase is a place for
trading cryptos et cetera and
i signed into my crypto wallet that i
hadn't used forever
because i don't really play in the
crypto field at all
you know i've i've just dabbled and
um i was doing it for a specific thing i
was actually just moving the
money around from the mft the dilbert
mft that just sold
on auction so i was just you know
signing up to my
accounts to move that around and
i open up my account
and there's this really big number there
which is weird because i didn't have
anything in my account
that i remembered but it turns out
that some time ago in my past i don't
remember it specifically
i thought to myself that i wanted to buy
something with some cryptocurrency
and apparently i had put so
i bought some crypto just to use for
some expenses
i wasn't planning to you know keep it or
hold it or anything
and you may have heard of it it's
something called
ethereum
and turns out those of you who follow
crypto
you're already laughing that's right
i accidentally
completely accidentally bought ethereum
at the bottom i think i put
less than a few thousand dollars into it
at the time
it's worth three hundred thousand
dollars
today three hundred thousand dollars
out of nowhere literally
not literally but just out of nowhere
it just appeared now that's my story
now i can only tell you that christina
and i
were legitimately testing to see if we
could make money appear
out of nowhere i'm not lying
these things actually happened and like
i say the first two
you know you could you could say that
those were just coincidence and
nothing special but the ethereum
i didn't even know i owned it i mean i
didn't even know
and it was it was when i did own it it
wasn't worth anything
right it was just a few thousand dollars
so that's my story let's talk about
something else
um there's a propaganda
article in the atlantic uh
which is trying to tell us that china is
no big
problem to us after all
now what do you think about that when
you see a story that says
you know joe biden was right china's no
big deal
their their military is a paper tiger
because they have to use most of their
military sources
resources to control their own public
which is a good point actually
that their economy is in trouble because
they're going to be too many
senior citizens their their population
may have decreased
and they get all kinds of problems now i
think all those things are reasonably
true
but this article doesn't mention all the
fentanyl they're sending us
and all the persuasion they're doing by
the internet uh
and you know stealing of intellectual
property which will be forever and
trying to dominate
the internet and god knows what so
i'm a little i have a mixed feeling here
when we see that china isn't the big
problem that some people think
because if there's something of fentanyl
killing 50 000 people a year
i feel like that's our biggest problem
isn't it
and that's just one little thing they're
doing so
i still think they're our biggest
problem but i would agree with
the tone of the article that uh the
united states has more advantages than
they do
and that might that might last
so i won't be too worried about them but
we have to put maximum
pressure on that situation
so big story today there are these new
emails being released
from the mueller investigation showing
the private communications of
let's say flynn manafort bannon kushner
etc
and here's the thing they don't seem to
have any news value
but they're in the news since when is it
okay
to just publish people's private email
when there's no news value because i
don't i don't believe there's even a
claim
that anything in them has any news value
this is just disgusting like what have
we become
that this is okay and why is anybody
okay with this
i don't think this has to do with what
political side you're on
i mean i'd be saying the same if this
were democrats or republicans
i mean why are we looking at private
emails this is way beyond
okay
so here's a little uh stuff i learned
about the arizona
audit of the 2020 election
in maricopa county so
uh i did not know this did you know that
prior audits were statistically
valid meaning that they had enough of a
sample that they already audited
that statistically speaking if there had
been a problem
the sample was big enough that it would
have it would have
found it but would it
i would like to question that if you do
if you do a
an audit that only samples even no
matter how
good your representative sample is is
that really going to catch fraud
because it seems to me fraud would be in
a pocket
and there's no reason to believe that
your random sample is going to hit that
pocket
or even if it did that you know that one
bad ballot would
tell you there were some massive
problems so
somebody says the samples were curated
yeah the other problem is you never know
right you never know because humans do
the auditing
so all you need is humans who want it to
go a certain way and you're probably
going to get it
so um but
if it's true that the the representative
sample
found absolutely zero problems which is
being reported
then maybe this will be zero
so i would say that the odds of the
arizona audit
coming out with some massive story about
election irregularity probably gets
lower every day all right so we're just
guessing without any information from
our perspective
but every day that you don't hear a leak
makes me suspicious you know because if
there were
big problems found i'm positive it would
have leaked already
even though they want not to leak even
though they're trying not to leak
you know they really don't want to leak
because then then
we'll get inoculated before they have
the big reveal maybe
but i just don't think this could not
leak it's just not
in the category of things that don't
leak it would be too easy to leak
so if we haven't heard anything yet i
think the odds of that coming up with
something
get lower every day but not zero and
like i always said
whether whether there was any fraud or
not
there will be there will be
because it's a system that
there's a high incentive to do something
with it and there are enough people who
want to that over time somebody's going
to be successful you just don't know if
it's happened yet
all right i guess the olympics is
banning
black lives matter apparel as well as
all
political clothing and i think to myself
why do we have olympics olympics are
just a total waste of time
there are a few things that i dislike as
much as the olympics
because it masquerades as a good thing
but i don't think it is
i think it's kind of a dark thing
because for every you know
few people who win some medals there are
all these people who wasted their entire
youth
training for something that made no
difference at all to them
so i just don't like the model of it but
we'll see if they can get away with
getting rid of the black lives matter
uh and other political statements
um you know one of the ways that you
know that the news is controlling us
is that there are some things that look
easy to solve
that don't get solved it's because the
news keeps us you know on
our teams and battling each other and
one of them is
school choice because it seems to me
that
if black americans wanted reparations
and they also wanted better school
choice and you know to fix the schools
they would just pair those two topics
and say look i know it's going to be
difficult
to write checks you know it's probably
too much to ask for
that you know checks would go out
because we couldn't figure out
who should pay and how much and who gets
it but how about this
how about we all agree that the schools
could be better
and how about we say that we'll we'll
we'll
we'll treat reparations as having been
solved if you work with us to make the
schools for everybody
but it'd be a bigger bigger improvement
for the black community because they're
in a bigger hole
if we make the schools better for
everybody we're just going to call that
reparations and we'll be even
because it's the biggest need it's the
biggest source of
ongoing systemic racism is the teachers
unions blocking school choice
so it's this is one of those cases where
there's such an
obvious path that it has to be that
we're all we're all brainwashed to not
solve these problems
and i would say that one of the big
problems with especially
uh black leadership but i guess this
would be true of any kind of leadership
from any group
so no reason to think it would be
especially true in the black community
but the leaders have a different
incentive
than the people who are being led the
leader's incentive is to keep as much
conflict going as possible
because that's how they thrive what's
good for the leaders is to not solve the
problem
because then there's no reason for a
leader if you solve everything
so as long as we have that situation
plus massive propaganda
there will be somewhat easy solutions to
problems that just
won't be done because we're at each
other's necks
all right and there's a story about the
intercept
i think glenn greenwald was one of the
founders of the intercept
but now he's no longer with them and is
a critic of them
i guess they're uh and what they did is
they somehow got a hold of hacked
information from the gab um social media
network that they claim has lots of
extremists on it
and they're going to search through this
personal data from the gab hack
to to do the fbi's work as glenn
greenwald says
to find the extremists and i'm thinking
to myself
how is this okay how is this okay
because let's say there are some
extremists that they find
and these extremists let's say
hypothetically they're really bad people
are they as bad as the people at the
intercept
i mean really if you were going to rank
people on how much they suck let's say
you really hated the extremists of
whatever and you say ah they're a 10 out
of 10 of suckiness
i hate those extremists well where the
hell are the intercept people who are
taking private information
from a hacked from hackers and pouring
through it to
ruin the lives of their extremists
that's sort of a ten right
i mean these are both despicable
potentially we don't know about the gab
people but that's the allegation
uh i don't know that they're going to
find worse people than they
are these are pretty bad people at the
intercept
bad bad people all right
this is coming to the conclusion
of my amazing amazing live stream
and since i wasn't watching the comments
as closely as i
sometimes do as i was looking at my
whiteboard
i want to see where you came out on this
one because it's a little weirder than
most
uh what happened at the end yesterday oh
so a lot of people are saying that my
live stream got cut off yesterday
but i'm not aware of it so on my end
i only saw your comments saying it was
cut off but it was never
cut off to me so i just completed it as
normal
and then afterwards i heard people say
it was cut off so i don't know anything
about it
it's possible
that it was some kind of decision that
youtube
you know maybe some sensory yanked it
for some reason
i don't know somebody's asking if i
write down my affirmations if there's
the one rule of affirmations and
this is the one rule that you can never
violate
don't ask me the details of affirmations
because if you ask me the details it
means you didn't understand it
it's about focus if you can focus by
you know peeing in the snow bank
or writing it down or chanting or just
thinking about it every day
or meditating telling your friends about
it whatever
it doesn't matter i don't think it's
sensitive to technique
i think it's all about focus and your
focus might be different
different
uh have i locked myself down again i
don't know what you mean
because i got the vaccination i mean
i've been socially distancing
pretty aggressively uh
trump on candace owens show i did not
see it but that sounds fun
so it's good to know that's there
you can't focus your way out of cancer
well
can't you it depends if
if reality is just the way it looks well
then no
but if reality is a simulation
then yes you just have to there just has
to be no
conflicting information that you do have
cancer or that it will kill you
now i'm not saying don't go to the
doctor because you could use
affirmations that would be dumb
um do you prefer staying at home
well that's an embarrassing question
i do think that people like me are gonna
have some
uh trouble adjusting to a post-pandemic
world
because i've got some serious introvert
stay-at-home
impulses and it's not going to be easy
for me
to be in public again um i can tell you
that
in the few cases where i've been out and
about where
i just had more stimulation you know
still socially distance but you know
having more stimulation around people
it was hard i i had
i had to run away and just hide at one
point just because there were too many
people in my day
i had to go to a quiet room and just
just be by myself for a while
so a lot of people who were sort of in
my
side of the uh equation you know the
people who are
say less less thrilled by social
interaction than some of
us some of the rest of you uh it's gonna
be tough
to go back to normal life
all right
oh good somebody liked this episode
that's all i want to hear
and i will see you tomorrow
