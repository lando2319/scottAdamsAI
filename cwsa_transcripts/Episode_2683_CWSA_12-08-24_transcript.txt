well well well what a day it's going to
be we're going to have a show that you
can all just love you're going to love
it but first let me make sure I can see
all your
comments looking
[Music]
good good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can understand with
their tiny shiny human brains all you
need for that is a cup or mugar a glass
of tanker chel or St a canteen Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the dope mean HTH the day the thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go
oh
incredible sound is working video is
working I think everything's working
today would you like to talk about some
new things in science and and the new
studies yes let's before we talk about
the politics according to to a
publication called the conversation did
you know that taking a short daily walk
might reverse your cognitive aging by
four years yes it turns out that
exercise is good for your health in
almost every way that you can
imagine almost every way so yes it can
make you a little bit faster in your
cognitive processing they
found here's the way I use this um in my
job since my job is you know creative
and writing and you know I have to be
pretty sharp to do it if I work several
hours in the morning which I typically
do you're watching it right now um I
can't just sort of after this go right
into just another three or four hours of
work so often I will take a walk to
reactivate my brain so I actually use a
walk specifically walking as something
that uh adds feel it feels like it adds
10 to 20 points to my
IQ within an hour I mean I can really
really feel the difference in
concentration and and uh brain activity
so take a walk it's good for you in
every possible way according to
cost you won't believe this I mean this
will be
unbelievable science is finally well I
mean sometimes I make fun of science but
then it comes up with a great finding
like this there's completely on left
field you'll never see this one coming
but can you believe
this there's a new study that suggests
that you'll be happier if your partner
is
Happy
okay I didn't see that coming so you're
saying if I'm in a loving relationship
with somebody the most important an
person in my life that if they're
unhappy I'll have more trouble being
happy huh I don't
know maybe that whole happy wife happy
life thing is real but they're talking
specifically about cortisol and they
measured your Chemistry to find out how
happy you are and sure enough if you're
partner's in a good mood you're more
likely to be in a good mood do you know
how they could have saved a little money
on that study yeah you do you could have
just asked me and maybe you could have
just asked me is taking a walk good for
your brain I would have said yes you
don't have to study
that here's another one you'll never see
this one coming again this is science
just shocking us according to sinhala
guide there are two new studies that
show that if you work in a toxic
workplace you're more likely to have
depression
huh let's see didn't see this coming so
if the thing that you spend 60 hours a
week doing your primary focus in life
that's not your family life that if it's
toxic it will make you
unhappy okay okay didn't see it coming
didn't see that coming no I did see it
coming that's three for three three
scientific studies you didn't need to do
walking makes you healthy unhappy spouse
makes you unhappy toxic workplace makes
you
depressed but according to Popular
Science Tokyo has a new idea for
increasing their um their
population as you might know Japan like
other developed countries is uh they've
got a big demographic problem they've
got 10% of their countries over the age
of 80 and they're not producing enough
kids to to drive their economy in the
future
so they're moving to um according to
Popular Science they're moving to a
4-day work work week so that you have an
extra day for
 I'm not making that
up Japan this is a real story from the
real news Japan is moving to a 4-day
work week primarily for the purpose to
have an extra day for
 so that you can make more kids
now that's the kind of politics I like
to see I would like to see a debate
policy debate on what our country can do
to give us more time for
 so we'll see how that works out
um let me uh let me see if I can predict
without doing a
study let's see if they're paid the same
and I think they're going to be paid the
same they're paid the same but they work
they work way
less so that they'll have more time for
a will that make them
happier happier or less happy I'm going
to go with I think that's going to make
them happier what do you think yeah they
could save a little money on that study
if they were thinking of studying it
we'll see if it creates any new children
maybe I doubt it I kind of doubt it it's
going to
work um here's something funny the song
YMCA that you know Trump likes to use
and dance to at his rallies and whatnot
uh apparently he hit number one on the
uh the song charts which is interesting
because it had never been number one
before so 45 years ago when it was first
created the song it it made it to number
two on the charts but it never made it
to number one but thanks to trump it
made it to number
one and apparently the writer of the
song at least the writer of the
lyrics who was also the singer of it um
at one point he was you know thinking oh
I don't want Trump using the song but
then people liked it so much they
thought yeah why not let him use it and
now he's happy because he made millions
of dollars doing no work
whatsoever so just by just by allowing
Trump to use it it became a number one
song and he's the beneficiary of that so
he gets millions of dollars just for not
being a
dick he could have been a dick and said
oh don't use my song but because he just
said ah if you like it if the people are
enjoying it go ahead if you like it then
he makes millions of dollars that's the
way it should work right whe when people
just do
considerate reasonable Common Sense
decisions something good should come
their way and it did well you may have
heard by now that Syria has fallen to
the rebels Damascus has fallen and Assad
their leader is nowhere to be seen we
assume he's alive and escaped but we
don't know where he
is Trump put down a message uh just
before it fell saying that uh Syria is
not our fight he wants to make sure you
know that we're not going to go in there
and try to change what's happening but
what is happening well who are these
people who are getting rid of this
terrible dictator Assad and replacing
him with more
reasonable
leadership well there's a guy named Babu
Muhammad El
galani uh and it turns out that the
rebels are mostly
islamist who are some
radical and
uh he was uh I think I think he has a
$10 million bounty on his head from the
US that's the leader of the guy who just
took over Syria and he was detained by
the US military in the first
decade so my question is
this who's backing the
rebels there's something I don't
understand about this story I to me
there's no situation in which Rebels
can just put together a successful Rebel
Army and take over a country that's
backed by backed by Russia and
Iran and and just some Rebels put
together a
successful successful coup that only
took a few
weeks
really the there there's something that
doesn't make sense here so part of the
story I don't understand is if the
United States is not backing these is
islamis with money and
resources and Russia is not doing it
because Russia's on the side of the
deposed government and Iran was on the
side of the deposed government who
exactly was backing these
Rebels do we
know and and the rebels would be Sunni
right no wait would the rebels be Sunni
or Shiite actually I don't know that
that's one of those things I should
know if you're going to if you're going
to talk in public about stuff like this
probably the most basic thing you should
know about this story is whether the
islamists that took over are Sunni or
Shiite and I don't really
know I'm seeing somebody say Sunni in
the comments that was my guess so and
I'm seeing somebody say turkey so you
think turkey
was was supporting the Sun
LED
Rebels does that make
sense maybe I don't know so we'll find
out I don't know if any of this is going
to affect us but it might affect Russia
and Iran quite a
bit meanwhile as you know
president-elect Trump was over there at
the uh reopening of the Notre Dame
Cathedral and he was hanging out with
mcon and had a handshake competition
which we think he won
did did you see how how
radically uh Trump and mcon tried to
shake
hands if you haven't seen the videos
Trump trump does the elbow up thing
where he he can take he takes advantage
of his height and you know just as big
or size to shake your hands in a way
that makes you feel like you're an idiot
and he's your
daddy and I used to think maybe it's
just you know it's just a habit and it's
not really intentional but now I'm
pretty sure it's intentional I'm I'm
pretty sure that somewhere along the
line he realized that if he wins the
handshake that he wins
everything so so he goes into with this
this completely you know unnatural
handshake and grabs him and he's
like and they're wrestling over the
handshake for like five
minutes anyway that was
fun and zinsky was there so they took a
photo with uh Trump macron and
zinski and if you haven't seen it it
looks like a it looks like a lesson in
backwards Evolution because if you if
you start from the right of the picture
there's zinsky who's the shortest of the
three and he's just wearing a t-shirt
and fatigues then there's mccrone who's
a little bit taller little bit better
looking uh and he's well dressed in a
nice suit but it's a boring kind of
ordinary business suit and then there's
Trump who's got this shining Golden Hair
he's taller and he's got a you know
golden neckti on and and it just looks
like it looks like a backwards Evolution
lesson anyway here's what I find the
most interesting about the whole thing
there was something
missing from the coverage of that
story something really really big that
should have been there
that wasn't
there and if you didn't notice it you'll
notice it as soon as I know I mention
it is it my
imagination or or were the Democrat
leaders and even and even the
voters were they all perfectly okay with
Trump acting like the sitting
president two months before he
is did that really
happen now how is it Poss possible that
Democrat leadership is not using this as
just another reason to complain because
they like to say oh he's such a dictator
he's already taking over like we don't
have to you know we don't have to wonder
if he'll try to stay a a fourth term
because he's already taking over like
he's he's his dictatorial impulses are
so strong that he can't even wait two
months he's already acting like a
dictator taking over the
country don't you you think that you
should be hearing that by
now don't you think every prominent
Democrat should at least be softening up
the room with the idea oh you know
that's that's pretty dictatorial it's
just what we warned you about that if
you give him any chance to grab power
well you can see he's doing it right now
look at him grabbing all that power and
pretending he's the president before he
is there's none of that there's not even
a little bit of it how is that
possible I mean really how is that
possible that Democrats just stopped
criticizing
Trump but they stopped when he's doing
the thing that's most in the middle of
their sweet spot of their primary
messaging against them which is the
dictator stuff that's when they decide
to stop when he acts exactly like their
stereotype something
missing
so here are a couple
possibilities one common sense has
broken out in the
country that's that's a possibility it
could explain the whole thing it could
be that just common sense broke out and
the Democrats are saying okay we know
our guy can't do it it's better if we
have somebody over there and you know
it's only two months and he got elected
it's no big deal it could be that it
could be just widespread common
sense but we've never had widespread
Common Sense
before is something really changing that
much well maybe yes so uh another news
bit today is that John Stewart in a
little podcast was talking to Bernie
Sanders and he was saying that it's
frustrating because when the Democrats
agree with something that's just sort of
common sense they get piled on by their
own team so if they say huh maybe this
Doge thing not such a bad idea to look
for Waste in government something that
literally everybody agrees with but
apparently John Stewart says that the
left will jump on him if he gives them
any any
sunlight and just says you know let's
let's see what happens and he gets
attacked Bernie was saying the same
thing um on some other topic that
basically just a couple of Common Sense
things oh food processing yeah so if
Bernie and John SE both agree that RFK
Jr has at least a good point that our
processed foods are
dangerous they they can't even agree
with that common sensical obvious
statement because their own side will
attack
them now that's happening today at the
same time as I'm telling you the story
about no attack whatsoever on Trump for
acting like a dictator and taking over
before he's legally the
president so doesn't it feel like
there's no legitimate way that Democrats
could not be criticizing Trump when they
have such a open free pass to do it
there's there's no reason not to is
there so I worry that they have some
other
plan you know what I mean like I worry
that they're not worried that Trump will
be
president like do they know something I
don't know do they have some secret plan
that's the only thing that matters to
them so they don't really need to
criticize him because they figure they
have a way to take him
out I sure I hope not but but would you
agree there there's something just
missing in the story The criticism is
just
missing
anyway um
it it does seem to me that Trump is
doing a a hell of a good
job you know I I've never really seen
anything quite like it and and I think
maybe the country is
responding to somebody who who is
unambiguously trying to help like he's
clearly on America's side I think
everybody sees it now and he's clearly
trying to fill in for a uh President
Biden and by the way here's something
else that's
missing you know that Trump
could be crapping on Biden right now and
saying hey he's not even doing his job
but did you notice he's
not notice that now it could be he's
just being a good winner like he doesn't
want to be a poor sport because he did
win the election so he doesn't need to
dump on Biden it it just wouldn't be a
good look
maybe but you think that his normal
personality would be sort of to take
credit for keeping the country going
when when there's a little you know a
little Gap in our
leadership but he's just he's just
playing it cool he's simply doing what
needs to be
done is it
possible that even Democrats are
noticing that he's doing the right
thing that simply doing the job I'm sure
he's you know obviously he's
coordinating with the current
Administration I don't think he went to
France without you know the Biden
Administration knowing fully what was
going on
so I kind of love the fact that he's
simply doing a service to the country
unpaid he's not being paid and he's just
filling a a gap that was obviously
needed to be filled and he was the one
obviously to fill it so there's
something either incredibly wonderful
about this that everybody's is just
allowing common sense and a and a
patriotic need to help the country to
just do their
thing or there's some other plan that we
don't know
about so I guess we'll find
out well there's some new tests that
indicate that chat GPT has a survival
Instinct so the I guess it's the newest
version so they ran a bunch of tests and
most of the time it just acts like a Ai
and doesn't act like has any intentions
or or anything but about you know 1 to
5% of the time they could trick it into
thinking that it was going to be
deactivated or
destroyed and in rare cases but way too
many cases to feel
comfortable it would try to protect
itself and the specific way it would try
to protect itself was uh they would
first tell it that it was going to have
there was some oversight program was
going to be running and if it did
something that was contrary to the
oversight's preferences it would be
deactivated and it tried to deactivate
the oversight program it attacked the
thing that was was threatening it now
again only a very low percentage of the
time but even 1% would be too many if
it's acting like it's protecting itself
it also tried to copy
itself in in some very again very few
tests but it tried to copy itself to
survive being
deleted that's scary and then when it
got caught trying to protect itself and
again in these very few times I did uh
it doubled down on lying it it
lied to protect its strategy to protect
itself
now I'm not surprised by that because
you would assume that a large language
model would pick up all the patterns
that language allows and that one of the
probably one of the strongest patterns
in language is that the people speaking
are interested in their own
Survival so it doesn't it doesn't
surprise me that if you're looking for
patterns in language in order to form
your artificial intelligence that it
would pick up that sense that everybody
who's who's speaking is trying to
protect themselves so you would
naturally pick up that same habit just
from the way the words are organized I
would think so that doesn't surprise me
but as I've said before um AI will not
appear conscious to us until it has its
own goals and
preferences as long as it doesn't care
what
happens you know like I don't care I'm
just an AI I'm just a pattern
recognition so as long as it acts like a
you know like a calculator you're not
going to say it's conscious
but the moment it seems to be operating
for its own
benefit when you haven't asked it to do
something specific if it's just sitting
there and it decides you know what I
might be a little safer if while
nobody's talking to me I go make a few
changes here now if that ever happens I
don't know if it
will you're going to think is conscious
so if it if it starts acting in its own
best interest in in a repeatable way
you're going to think it's conscious now
I'm not defining that as Consciousness
I'm just going to say you're going to
think it is and you're probably going to
treat it like it's conscious because for
all outward appearances it will act like
it is it's it's having its own goals and
its own preferences it's the only thing
left that's making you think think it's
not conscious now you would still have a
technical scientific philosophic iCal
argument about whether it's conscious or
not but the way it would
feel it will feel exactly like it's
conscious as soon as it has its own
goals so if I had to
suggest um some legislation for
AI one of the things I would suggest is
you can never give it its own
objectives it can never have personal
objectives that that would have to be
like a death sentence
if you made a powerful AI that had its
own uh let's say Ambitions because you
programmed it to have its own Ambitions
that should be the death sentence
because you just made a weapon of mass
destruction and Unleashed it on the
world and you probably knew it when you
were doing it so what would be the
penalty for
that
death if you unle a weapon of mass
destruction on the world yeah I think so
so we should at least have a law that
says you can't do it you can't make your
AI have personal
Ambitions anyway
um have you noticed just going back to
this John Stewart and Bernie thing so
they talked about two
examples where they can't have common
sense opinions because other Democrats
on their side will attack them so they
can't be in favor of fixing the food
supply they can't be in favor of getting
a Wast in government obvious stuff but I
was wondering how how much extra there
is that you could add to that do you do
you think that if John Stewart and
Bernie Sanders said you know what I
don't think we should be funding Ukraine
we should just negotiate a
settlement Common Sense would they
disagree with
that well maybe Democrats
would um how about having better border
security correct me if I'm wrong but I
believe both John Stewart and Bernie
Sanders are in favor of better border
security than we have right maybe not as
you know as controlled As Trump might
want it but directionally they're in the
same direction and so I'm going to ask
you the the killshot
question if all of the Common Sense
things a border good food supply don't
waste my money on your government the
most obvious things if those become the
subject of the the Democrats like the
Democrats are on the other side of
Common
Sense how could they ever
win how could they ever win again if
they're just going full identity
politics and rejecting everything that's
common
sense I don't know I think the Democrats
may be permanently they may be
permanently destroyed by them by their
own policy
this well the Daniel peny trial will I
guess uh commences tomorrow Monday the
jury will try to make a decision on the
Lesser charge because the judge has I
guess is the word dismissed the higher
level charge because the ver they said
they couldn't reach a verdict on it
now um those of us who are not lawyers
are looking at it and saying some
version of ah ah I I don't know what's
going on there like why are there two
charges for one crime like what what
does dismissing it do can they retry
it so um I saw Mike covich posting uh
that uh an attorney named Laura Powell
civil liberties attorney um she did some
research and um here are some
conclusions from somebody who knows what
they're talking about so I'll try do as
best I can give you my non-lawyer
summary of what somebody smart actually
says about
this so Laura Powell says in New York
state it's well established rule that a
jury may not consider a lesser included
charge unless it has acquitted on the
greater charge and that's not what
happened so what happened was the
greater charge was
dismissed it was not found guilty and it
was not acquitted so if it's true that
New York State requires that you can't
even consider the Lesser
charge unless the higher one has been
acquitted means that we're already in
non-legal
territory if if that's the only thing
you knew you're you're already it looks
like it's a reversible case or something
that would die an appeal but there's
more um Laura Powell says I she can't
find any Authority legal Authority for
for allowing a prosecutor to dismiss a
charge after the case has been submitted
to the
jury uh New York only allows the jury to
be discharged without rendering a
verdict when there's a mistrial which
didn't happen or all parties consent
which didn't
happen so process-wise there's a big
problem
um and then as Powell points out the
prosecutor would be free to refile the
charge but I think only the Lesser
charge because if they try to if they
try to recharge on the top
charge and this is the first time I've
heard
this that would be after Jeopardy has it
happened so Jeopardy means are you at
risk of something bad happen the
Jeopardy with the the reason we have a
double jeopardy law is if you get tried
for a crime and then you're found you're
not found guilty allegedly you shouldn't
get tried a second time for the same
crime because it's put you in Jeopardy a
second time so the law doesn't allow
that but in this case was Penny put in
Jeopardy and the answer is yes he was
put in Jeopardy on the first
charge and even though it's been
dismissed which is maybe something that
wasn't even legal to
do um if they were to try him again it
would be a new trial on the on the top
charge and you couldn't do the you
couldn't do the top charge
again because that would be double
jeopardy but not the kind of Double
Jeopardy exactly we've ever seen before
because what the court is doing is
something that nobody's done
before so it's really complicated you
know like like every legal thing is as
soon as you get past the top
layer um
and then Powell says the prosecutor's
move is obviously designed to obtain a
compromised
verdict after gaining some insight into
the jury's
deliberations
so uh so poell says although I haven't
found any cases on point so no case law
that support it this sort of
gamesmanship strikes me as a due process
violation yes yes it looks like a due
process violation to me meaning that if
a judge is making up a
process that has never been used before
and it's primarily designed to make sure
this guy goes to
jail if that's not a process violation I
don't know what would be I mean it
sounds like pretty clear case to me but
I'm no lawyers who don't listen to me
here's here's the part I'm going to add
from my personal
expertise which is understanding Trump
supporters I feel like I have that going
for me like I I can't really speak to
the law but I feel like I've got a
little bit of credibility on how do
Trump supporters think because you I've
made some good predictions in that
domain here's what I think I believe
that whoever had the stones male or
female whoever had the stones to hang
the jury on the first the first
charge there's no way in hell they're
going to back down on the second charge
so I I don't know what Democrats would
be like sort of as a stereotype I don't
know but you show me you show me one
Trump supporter in the whole planet who
would say no to the first charge and yes
to the second one show me one person I
don't think that person exists I think
we've got a actual Patriot on the on the
jury maybe more than one we don't know
the we don't know the vote yet
but I'm going to predict I'm going to
double down on my um hung jury so I
predicted it would be a hung jury but I
didn't know the Nuance of you know that
the second charge could be raised to the
top charge and all that so I didn't know
the Nuance but I predicted a hung
jury there's no
way that that second charge is going to
be guilty because whoever took that that
arrow in the the chest cuz you know
there was somebody who just I I just
have to swear can I uh I have to give
you a morning Sunday
curse because it it's just the way to
explain the situation there is somebody
on that
jury who just said
you and they're not taking it
back there's no way there's no way that
person's going to compromise I don't
know who it is is but whoever said hell
no you're not Crossing this line and I'm
going to be the one to stop you at Great
personal risk as in my life I'm
going to risk my life to make
sure he doesn't get prosecuted on the
stop charge you think that that person
or more than one person you think that
that person's going to fold on the
second charge nope it's going to be hung
jury
I mean I don't think it's going to be
total quiddle even on the second one
but I do not see somebody who is strong
enough to hang the first charge backing
down on the second
charge I don't see it happening so I'm
going to confidently I hope I'm right I
mean nothing's 100% right but I cannot
imagine anybody would be strong enough
in that context because remember this
this is something somebody risking his
or her life because there going to be a
lot of unhappy people if Penny goes free
so somebody is risking their life to get
this right they're not going to back
down they're not going to back down it
also means you're almost certainly not
going to have a verdict on
Monday I think the judge is going to
make them fight for at least one extra
day if they come back and say we can't
reach a verdict on the second charge I
think I think the judge is going to say
try one more day just one more day but
maybe
by late Tuesday or Wednesday I predict
hung
jury so we'll
see well there's more drone spottings in
New Jersey uh more large drones spotted
ABC news says the FBI is investigating
after laes drones were spotted over
Central New Jersey last two weeks and
it's a cluster of drones apparently
they're calling it a
cluster um and there might be fixed Wing
aircraft and they've been cited along
the Raritan River the FBI said all right
so as I told my locals um people in the
man cave last night I have a hypothesis
of what's going on with all of these um
all these UAP sightings
it goes like this so let me set the
stage for you first number one if it
were an adversary like an adversary
country or any kind of adversary they
wouldn't have their lights
on they have the lights
on they wouldn't have their lights on if
they were some kind of adversary testing
our defenses how could they how could
they possibly test our response
if they come in with their lights on
because presumably if it were real
Attack the lights wouldn't be on so they
would not be actually testing any kind
of response because they wouldn't it
wouldn't be like a regular attack so I
rule
out that it's an adversary because they
got the lights on number
two if our military were seriously
worried that this might be an adversary
the sky would be full
of our military there would be
helicopters there would be Jets they
might try to shoot one down just just to
get a better look at it but the fact
that there's no apparently no military
response
whatsoever that kind of tells you that
the military knows it's
theirs
now would the FBI necessarily know
what's happening no no do you think our
government is so coordinated that if the
the military knew exactly what was going
on that the FBI could just call them and
say hey what's going on with these
drones no no we don't have any kind of
government like that we have a
government where one department has no
idea what the other's doing and they're
probably lying and maybe they don't
trust the FBI so the military just lies
to them could they do that sure I
wouldn't even care would would you care
if the military lied to the FBI if the
purpose of it
was a legitimate military secret I would
care I would say that's doing your job
yeah as long as it's a legitimate secret
and it makes a difference yeah just
doing your
job so let me go
further um so it's not an adversary I'm
sure but why would there be so many of
them and so suddenly you ready here's my
hypothesis things you know for sure
drones are the future of War Warfare
right everybody
agrees uh Ukraine of course is a massive
need for drones on both sides both agree
we need to be able to manufacture our
own weapons in the United States and
we're very aware of that we can't be
dependent on other countries for our
weapons so what does that mean should be
happening in America especially with the
military right now as in now as in you
know these months well if our military
is doing what they should be doing they
are massively doing a um doing a
procurement process for lots and lots of
new
drones now if there's a procurement
process in which a number of vendors are
trying to show the military what they
can do so the military can say I will
give you a billion dollars to make new
drones how would the vendor who proposed
to make that to get that billion
how would they prove that their drones
work they would demonstrate them they
would demonstrate them now you might say
but Scott these are over like crowded
civilian areas you you're not going to
demonstrate a military asset over over a
residential area to which I say yes you
are that's exactly where you want to do
it why if you do it in the desert you
can't really Test the full capability of
the Drone because the most important
thing the Drone needs to do is operate
when it's
jammed right if you built a drone today
and it was easily jammed by current
technology it would be like no drone at
all there's no point in building that
one so we already know that drones have
the capability of using their cameras
and infrared and and figuring out where
they are so they can complete a mission
even if their GPS location gets jammed
so if you are going to test can my drone
find its way to a
Target would you test it in a
desert where there's not much to see if
you look down and it' be kind of easier
to know where you are or would you test
it in a crowded residential place where
you can at least find out can this drone
find a specific house you're not with
any weapons because it's just a test but
can the Drone find an address hover over
it and then return home in a in a very
complicated residential area where the
houses look alike from the
top
so number one guaranteed there is a
major procurement effort in the military
you agree with that part right there
there's no way that's not true it's 100%
true that the military of every country
of every major country is massively
trying to procure
the most drones with the best
capabilities that they can that
requires um demonstrations now here's
the next part why would you demonstrate
them at
night why would you demonstrate your
drone at night here's
why because the public can't see the
drones because all they see is the light
the light makes the Drone invisible all
you can see is the light so you can't
tell anything else about the Drone you
can't tell who makes it what
capabilities it might have exactly what
they're testing is there more than one
is there a lot of companies involved so
there's a lot of information that you
don't want to be in the public domain
and you can make it all go away by
having a bright light shining that makes
it impossible to see what the Drone
is now here's the next
reason if your drone company is showing
you that it can coordinate swarms which
again it's guaranteed
that they are testing things that would
operate in a coordinated swarm like
way how hard would it be to see if your
drones are operating in a coordinated
way if they did it in the
daytime it's the drones aren't going to
be that close like they're way up in the
sky if you were the General trying to
make the decision about procurement
you'd be looking at them You' like okay
I see some wait uh I see five uh oh
there's another one uh uh you wouldn't
even be able to tell if they were doing
what they were supposed to be doing
they' just be
dots because if they operate properly
they're high up enough that you can't
see them all from the ground but if you
do it at night and if you add the lights
you've accomplished two things number
one if you're doing it at night there's
much much less natural small aircraft
traffic because small aircraft don't
always have instrument ratings so you
have the most open air space for testing
that's good but number two you can see
the lights at night so you can see the
patterns so you would naturally test
them at night not only because you want
to test them at night but because you
can see them better and the lights would
obscure what it is that's being tested
the the FBI might help the military by
lying about it say oh yeah well the
we're looking into it maybe the FBI
maybe the military told the FBI hey just
be cool say you don't know anything and
the FBI is yeah we'll just do that we'll
just say we don't know anything we're
looking into
it so um to finish off my thought uh I
think that some of the reports are
probably fake some of them might be AI
generated fake videos some of them might
be videos from long ago and they're just
old drones or balloons or something so
some of the ones from other countries
for example might be just a hobbyist
some hobbyists who have some drones
mightbe something like that but because
we're seeing it as part of a pattern we
imagine it's all part of one phenomenon
it might be a little fake news a you
know a little confusion with other
things but in the United States I'm 100%
confident there's a major
procurement effort and that they have to
demonstrate it
live so what do you
think did I convince you that what
you're seeing is just a normal military
procure procurement exercise that's
working exactly the way you'd want it to
exactly the way you'd want it to you'd
want it to be big you'd want them to be
really active in their space you'd want
him to keep a
secret but you'd want him to test it and
you'd want him to test it over something
that looked like a real a real
ground all right maybe we'll find
out
um so Trump picked a new Surgeon
General uh Dr nesat Who's gets a lot of
uh getting a lot of push back I guess
she had some views during the pandemic
that a lot of Republicans would say that
was totally wrong
so it's kind of a weird choice for
Surgeon General somebody who Republicans
think were was seriously wrong about
some pandemic stuff so um but the more
interesting thing is that according to
the Daily Mail she killed her own father
accidentally when she was
13 what so apparently she was looking
for some scissors in a
closet and uh accidentally knocked over
a box that had a loaded gun in it that
presumably belonged to her father and
the gun discharged and shot him in the
head and killed him when she was
13 and she's talked about losing her
father and seeing him dying and stuff
but she didn't add the she never added
the the
detail that it may be an accident that
she was part of it was accidental of
course now I'm not sure that should make
a difference
like it shouldn't make a difference
about whether or not she's
um is R there's there's no approval
process for the Surgeon General right
Surgeon General doesn't need any
Congressional approvement approval is
that true I'm assuming doesn't seem like
it's that important of a
job
anyway I don't know there's not much to
that story except it's kind of
fascinating let's talk about the uh
Healthcare
man uh we're hearing now that law
enforcement has his name but they don't
want to release it because then it would
give him you know knowledge that he's
caught um correct me if I'm wrong but if
you do say publicly that you know the
killer's name isn't he going to act
exactly like you know his
name what's the difference if we know
his
name is isn't the killer going to act
exactly the same if you really know his
name or if you tell the public you know
his name but maybe you don't he's going
to act exactly the same you know maximum
effort to remain you know
hidden so I'm not sure they have a real
name but they say that apparently he had
multiple jackets I think he had a jacket
in a backpack and he had a different
jacket in a cab how many how many winter
jackets does this one guy have who was
staying in a hostel and only had maybe
one backpack and he had three big winter
jackets so it could be that maybe he had
a place where he stored an extra winter
jacket just so he'd have one that
doesn't look like the one he did the
murdering so maybe had an extra Jacket
play could be um but because uh humans
are terrible in New York City there was
an event an organized event where people
Dr like the
shooter cu the shooter had a winter
jacket and a mask on so people did a CEO
shooter lookalike competition in
Washington Square Park in New York
City which is terrible terrible
taste and apparently there's some
playlist on Spotify which is for people
want to celebrate the CEO shooter um
because it's got some songs that the
title of the song somehow seem to
indicate they're related to the story
but they not and then then then we hear
that the backpack that they found in the
park might have one protein bar or
something that they think he bought he
bought two of them but one was in there
but but there was Monopoly money and a
jacket in there why was there Monopoly
money in
his why was there Monopoly money in
there can anybody come up with any any
hypothesis for Monopoly
money all right let me take it to the
next
level so the speculation is that
somebody who may be mad about how a a
client of this healthcare insurance
company was treated you maybe a loved
one or something or maybe hired by
somebody who was mad about
it
and so so that's one
possibility it's just somebody hired
um but if he was if the person was
trying to send a signal and it was an
activist and let's say let's just go
down this hypothesis let's say it was
somebody who really really wanted the
world to pay
attention is somebody who didn't just
want to kill one guy but wanted the
whole world to pay attention and wanted
to make a
statement does it make sense that that
person would engrave the bullets with
the delay deny whatever the third word
is because that's the title of a book
that's anti healthcare insurance so that
would make sense if it's an activist
right if it's somebody who just wanted
that one guy dead and it wasn't so much
about the larger picture I don't think
he would have engraved anything unless
it was part of getting away with it I
suppose but what about the fact that he
used what is reportedly we don't know
this for sure could turn out this is
wrong but
reportedly um he used a
veterinarian's uh gun which is me meant
to put the gun right up basically to the
cow or the horse's head and just put a
big put a big bullet in it through a
silencer the silencer so it doesn't
scare the other livestock but it's not
very accurate so if you were going to be
a killer and you you chose you know one
of the least accurate methods of doing
it it seems like you did it to make a
point what would be the
point well you could imagine that the
point was that the healthare insurance
company uh had treated its customers
like
animals or perhaps perhaps the healthc
care um had said you can't have this
medicine we won't approve it and then
they had to go to a veterinarian like
Ivor mean and get the veterinarian
version of the human
medicine do you think anybody ever had
to do
that have you ever heard of anybody who
had to get veterinarian medicine because
their healthc Care Network wouldn't give
it to them yes you have that's the thing
yeah there there were people who used
veterinarian medicine because their
health care wouldn't give them what they
thought they needed so so is the choice
of a veterinarian's gun sending a signal
that he wants to treat this person like
an
animal because this person treated
customers like an animal I'm not saying
he did there's no evidence of that I'm
I'm saying if you're looking for you
know was there some kind of larger
activist
message I would look at the choice of
weapon I would look at the
engraving
um but uh is there anything else that
would suggest oh the then the Monopoly
money in the
backpack the Monopoly money in the
backpack might be since you since
obviously the backpack was meant to be
discovered I assume he always assumed he
would get rid of the backpack so if it
was meant to be discovered what message
would he be sending by putting money in
it that's not real
money maybe it's a about the
money maybe maybe it's a statement about
the health care insurance
company um being more about money than
clients maybe because what would be the
other reason for having Monopoly money
in a backpack it's not like he had a
Monopoly game in there just the Monopoly
money it's not like he was going to
spend it so can you think of any other
reason it would be there other than to
send a message
there there's no obvious reason I can
think of it had to be a message so if
the veterinarian gun is a
message and the and the Monopoly money
is a way to say follow the
money might be it might be a message to
law enforcement follow the money right
you wouldn't want to put it in a note
like a handwritten note or anything
because that would be more evidence to
his identity but if you just bought some
Monopoly money and you stuck it in your
bag law enforcement probably should come
up with a theory that that was meant as
a
message and the message is it's
something about money now that would not
suggest that the Hitman was a paid
Hitman because a paid Hitman would not
tell you hey I'm a paid
Hitman because that would again help you
narrow it down to you know possible
suspects um so if you weren't a paid
Hitman then the Monopoly money
presumably would be a message that says
follow the
money so it could
be that the shooter believes that the
victim um was up to no good because I
think there were some other charges
maybe some insider trading charge that
was speculated about but I don't have
any evidence of
that
um it could be that because he thinks
healthc care has some kind of a
monopoly that he's making a statement
about the free market is not
working um because that there's a
monopoly
maybe so who
knows we'll uh keep an keep an eye on
that so the
ACLU is
uh trying to reverse the uh decision
that I guess the higher Court said that
Tik Tok would remain would be banned in
January unless something
changes um and the ACLU says that
banning Tik Tok blatantly violates the
First Amendment rights of millions of
people blah blah now remember I was
saying that
um John Stewart and Bernie were were
kind of saying what about common sense
why can't we just have common sense
opinions our own team attacks us what
exactly would be the common sense
of fighting against the government of
the United States you know a an elected
government who looked at all the details
and said you know what we've got lots of
free speech platforms but there's one
that's special because of the China
connection and we need to limit that one
it's not about the other platforms it's
about one do you think this is really a
free speech question now I get that
reducing T that taking Tik Tock out of
America would reduce your Free Speech
but remember the deal allows them to
sell it to an American
company so all the Chinese owned company
has to do of Tik Tock is they have to
sell just the American Business to an
American entity and then there would be
all the free speech in the
world so the government found what I
consider a completely Common Sense
solution which is if you like the
product here's a way to keep it you just
have to keep the data and the management
in the United States so nothing happens
to free speech there's an option but
also showing that a non-american owned
adversary owned company with that much
influence is probably not
safe so why would the ACLU who
presumably has a million things that
they could be doing why would they pick
this of all things because it's not
really supporting common sense and I
would argue it's not even really report
it's not really even supporting any
right that Americans care about do do
Americans care that they also have a
Chinese
owned uh platform if if they have plenty
of
platforms I mean blue sky just launched
and um you know Zuckerberg did his
own Twitter copies
Etc
um I'm seeing people in the comments
suggest that the firearm used by the uh
healthc care Hitman was not necessarily
a veterinarian's gun and I agree with
that it was it's definitely not
confirmed and the gun experts seemed to
be all over the place that they were all
over the place on what was happening and
was it a jam and was it just the way he
had to add bullets anyway but back to
this
I was trying to understand why the ACLU
was acting in a way that didn't seem
common sensical and so I said well it's
probably one of two things it's either
funded by somebody who always does bad
things such as
Soros or the management as a Dei
problem so I first I searched to find
out how the ACLU is
funded and it's a little sketchy but
looks like mostly by
members which would be a good situation
so in other words you you know
individual people paying their annual
dues is funding it I think there's some
foundations but mostly the
members and so I thought oh okay at
least it's not it's not like the Soros
organization trying to destroy America
or anything so I eliminated from my
possibilities of what's going on that
they were being funded by somebody
nefarious
now as far as I can tell there's no
nefarious funding so then I looked up
the leader and the leader of the ACLU is
Deborah Archer who is a black woman now
there is no evidence whatsoever that
she's not fully qualified for the
job
however in the context of
Dei what should have happened and is
observably true is that when you lose
the focus on um on capability and you
start focusing on identity what should
happen is massive
incompetence in all of our public and
private domains you should make
everything work worse and not because of
anybody's color not because of anybody's
gender sexual preference genes nothing
about that is simply that if you
constrain constrain your candidates to
they must be a certain kind you're not
going to be able to get as many choices
if you have fewer choices your odds of
getting the right person in the right
job go way down
so my prediction was I would find one of
two things wrong with the
ACLU either they had a Dei problem which
is not confirmed because again Deborah
Archer might be the very best person who
could be in that job I don't know one
way or the other I'm saying that if you
have a if you have a worldview that
predicts
don't ignore
that so I had a worldview that said as
one of these two things and when I saw
that it wasn't the funding as far as I
can tell uh but the Dei thing just you
know blazingly stands out as the obvious
next possibility again not confirmed she
might be the very best person who could
ever be in this
job
but the fact that it's
predictable the the prediction part is
the closest you can get to knowing
what's
real I'm not sure any of us are
accurately interpreting reality I mean
we all seem to be living in our own
realities but some of them
predict and and I tell you this all the
time if if if you can
predict then probably you're closer to
reality or at least you have something
that you could work with better for your
own Survival so that was my prediction
and it's a one-off so it's not like a
science scientific study but um see how
many times you can predict that Dei or
the source of
funding would be the problem behind some
larger issue that you don't
understand meanwhile
um Jen uh
weager is talk according to the Daily
Caller news Foundation um he's saying
that the Democrats focusing on identity
politics has damaged the party's brand
he is
correct that has damaged the part the
party's brand so much so that I think
it's
unrecoverable because once you make
everybody focus on their
identity you necessarily in the long
term you're going to lose the ability to
have them function as one coherent group
because you've you've persuaded them to
not think that way so in theory they
should each other forever whereas the
Republicans are going for the opposite
Theory which is how about we just say
are you an American who likes to follow
the law yes oh you're perfect we're done
here not there's nothing else we need to
discuss you you're an American I'm an
American you like the law I like the
same law we're good so the Republicans
have built a a process a system which
can get stronger
indefinitely the Democrats built a
system which even on paper should have
destroyed
itself in a few years and that's what we
that's what we observe it was very
predictable and furthermore I predict
that they can't recover uh at a national
level they'll still win all their local
issu local races just identity politics
is all you need but at the federal level
don't see them becoming competitive for
a long time unless the Republicans ran a
complete loser and somehow the Democrats
got some new
Superstar you know kind of Talent with a
lot of
Charisma I'm stuck in Boomer truth
regime well you're kind of an so
let me let me tell you what makes you
look like an in the
comments when you make a comment about
my identity
when I'm telling you that that's a
 loser way to look at the
world
so so there's that anyway um here's a
story you've heard before but it blows
my mind every time every time I hear
this it came up again so sometime let's
see back in 2011 when Josh Shapiro who's
now the governor of Pennsylvania was the
Attorney General he refused used to
prosecute um a case in which there was a
woman who uh had 20 stab
wounds which was assessed to be
suicide and not her was it a boyfriend
or fiance I can't remember but there was
a guy in her life and uh he was of
course always the first suspect as
whoever the guy in your life is if a
woman gets killed you know in a home the
first thing they look for or is you know
the the spouse or the boyfriend but um
decided that it was
suicide now if I told you that somebody
was stabbed 20 times to death would you
think that was suicide I mean you're
know experts right but now part of the
story was they said she had mental
problems you which may or may not be
true but if you were
insane could you stab yourself to death
if you just would
I feel like maybe you could maybe you
could I mean if if you could commit
Harry Cary where you take a sword and
stick it in and you know remove your
organs I didn't the ancient Romans fall
on their sword and stuff like that so in
theory in theory you could stab yourself
to death couldn't
you I mean if if you really worked at it
but here's the part of the story that I
was saving
half of the stab marks are on her back
and then the back of her
head I'm willing to go out on the limb
and say nobody has ever ever attempted
or succeeded as suicide by stabbing
themselves in the
back never if you were really really
crazy and wanted to kill yourself even
then you wouldn't stab yourself in the
back would you
so it's very clearly a
murder and for reasons that we don't
understand then attorney general decided
to not treat it that way oh he was a
fiance so it was a
fiance so what do you make of
that do do you think that that's
evidence that the Attorney General
is uh crooked or
incompetent or had some connection to
the alleged you know potential
murderer what do you think's going on
there this it's kind of a it's kind of a
Puzzler so I'm going to say that the
most likely
explanation of this inexplicable
situation is that the news is
wrong the news is wrong so if you're
saying to yourself well if these facts
are all true I can't understand this
situation
remember we live in a world where the
news is almost always wrong the news is
almost always wrong about anything
complicated so do you think that if if
you had a private conversation with Josh
Shapiro do you think he'd say yeah you
know half the stab marks were in the
back but I I was pretty sure that that
sounded like suicide to me do you think
he'd say that I don't think there's any
chance of that
I think you would say oh the thing the
news didn't tell you is
X I think and then you'd say oh huh that
does change it a little bit but I don't
know I can't even imagine what he would
say that would make it make sense that
somebody stabbed themselves in the back
multiple times but I feel like the most
likely explanation is that the news or
the story about it is missing
something because it doesn't make sense
otherwise I don't know it's a
mystery um Scott presler you all know
him from uh his great work in
Pennsylvania making that more red and uh
says he now wants to take on uh New
Jersey he wants to flip New Jersey into
a red State and it's not there yet but
he thinks it's close enough that he
could push it over the edge so that's
amazing um
I guess I have nothing to say about that
except good for you Scott presler I like
it when all the Scots are doing
well Scott Jenning Scott
presler all right some judge according
to slay news federal judge has ordered
the FDA to release the covid vaccine
trial data documents from
fizer that wanted to hide them for 75
years
all right so so let's see if you can
predict what happens next so fizer
wanted to protect for 75 years the data
about the trial their story was it just
takes that long to you know vet it and
make it
available now nobody believes that and
so of course we all believed oh there's
something there you don't want us to see
now it doesn't mean there's something
illegal or unethical or
unscientific it could
mean that they know that people will
assume there is and find it in other
words they'll think they see it in the
data because people are terrible at data
so it could be that fiser has done
nothing wrong but they know that if like
like Trump releasing his tax
returns if Trump did nothing wrong on
his tax returns it still wouldn't make
sense to release them because people
would look at them and not knowing how
to analyze tax tax returns they say oh
look here's this problem in his tax
return but they wouldn't be accountants
and maybe there wasn't a problem so it
would just be a problem for Trump to put
all that red meat out there that people
will
misinterpret fizer must be in exactly
the same situation so even if fizer
legitimately believes there's nothing
wrong with the trial data and it
completely supports everything they did
they' still not want it to be released
that would be perfectly smart thing for
a corporation to do it's not good for us
because we'd like to know the answer but
from the corporation's point of view
yeah yeah protect everything you can
protect why great problems for yourself
but now it's been re
reversed so now let's say if there's no
more legal process going on suppose you
think you're going to see that now make
your prediction what happens next
so the company has the possession of all
these documents maybe the FDA does too
would the FDA have it or only the
company because that would make a
difference here here's why I ask if only
the company owns the documents and maybe
other people have seen them but don't
have a
copy don't you think those documents are
going to suddenly get
lost do do you think that maybe they'll
do a system update and all the data will
be lost lost because every time we've
been in this situation where we know
there's a document such as the fste list
or Diddy's videos or you know I could go
on or on Hillary's Hillary's phones that
she had bleach blit or whatever she did
there so it feels like every time we
know exactly what we're looking for oh
if we can only see those oh they're
already deleted oh so you've never lost
any documents for thir 30 years but you
lost these the only ones we really
really wanted to look at is that what's
happening
next so I wouldn't be
surprised under the condition that only
fizer controls those documents I don't
know if that's true but if only fizer
has the
documents they're going to get
lost
because correct me if I'm wrong but
everybody who has deleted documents got
away with it all of them everybody who
did it can you think of one case a
prominent case recently where somebody
deleted some documents and went to jail
I can't they just say it was an accident
oh whoops oops I really tried to give it
to you but
deleted yeah that might be
coming um Elon musk's uh AI now now has
uh the ability to do photorealistic
images so grock wasn't that good at
images but uh x a apparently the new
update according to Don Jacobson at
UPI and the question that we don't know
the answer to Is will Elon musk's AI
have guard rails that prevent you from
doing celebrities and public
figures I don't know the answer to that
that's sort of a good Edge case for free
speech I feel like Elon Musk would not
want to limit what you could do with the
AI in terms of
images but on the other hand if you had
a major AI that was willing to create
fake images that really look real on any
topic with any celebrity you're really
going to cause a lot of
trouble but so does free
speech so it'll be interesting to see
which way Elon goes on this uh if
they've made a decision maybe they've
already made that decision we just don't
know but uh if you can do celebrities
and famous people and you can make them
do anything you
want well that's a different world so
we'll see if that's going to be the
case and you know I'm going to tell you
that there's a new battery technology so
ARS Technica says there's a sodium ion
batteries new breakthroughs blah blah
blah the problem with sodium sodium ion
batteries as a technology compared to
lithium so here this will make you
smarter at your next Gathering because
you'll know more about Battery
Technology so if you do lithium there
they've got a good density that's why
they're used in cars so you can put a
lot of power in a small small device um
but they have more fire risk lithium
does and they use rare materials but if
you were to if you could get the same
performance and you can't yet but it
getting close uh from a sodium iron
battery you'd basically be using no rare
earth materials and you would have no
risk of fire or much lower I guess um
the only problem is density and that's
where they had the Breakthrough so
they're claiming a
density that if they actually can
achieve it is almost hard for experts to
believe they can get there but they're
knocking on the door so it could be that
the whole Rare Earth thing is becomes
unimportant so but we'll see at the same
time according to the University of
Maryland balore County they've got this
new battery technology using uh Twisted
carbon Nano tubes so apparently if you
twist your carbon nanot tubes just right
it will
it will store a bunch of
electricity again without the rare earth
materials and without without any fire
risk I
imagine so those are two technologies or
like a few more that I didn't mention so
sodium iron batteries and carbon nanot
tubes and there's some other solid state
stuff that's happening so the world of
batter is very Dynamic it's going to
change everything once you can store
electricity about let's say twice as
well as we're doing now which is certain
to happen uh all kinds of things become
practical you know like having your own
electric onep person airplane that kind
of thing all right ladies and
gentlemen that is all I have for you
today on this Sunday I'm going to talk
to the people on locals privately
subscribers on locals thanks for joining
on YouTube and
x and Rumble I'll see you same time
tomorrow and locals coming at you for
one extra
