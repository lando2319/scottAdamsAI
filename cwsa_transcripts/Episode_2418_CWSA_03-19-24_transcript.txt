people on YouTube as
well uh well oh here we
go we got comments from all of
you keep doing
that we'll get this system
working good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization coffee with Scott Adams if
you'd like to take this experience up
the levels that nobody can even
understand with their little human
brains all you need is a cuper muger a
glass of tanker chal steine a canteen
joer flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go
ah well people are pouring in because
the news is so much
fun so much fun all right here's a
interesting piece of news I saw in Brian
relly post there's a solar powered weed
picker that can work all day in the
fields picking weeds and it doesn't
weigh much and uh it just runs around
picking Wheats and apparently that
allows you to use a fewer
pesticides but really it's the beginning
of my robot
Farm I don't know why but I always
wanted to own a farm but I don't like
getting dirty and stuff I don't like
bugs and hay bales and cow poop and
stuff I like a nice gentleman Farm a
robot run Farm indoors preferably but if
asked to me out doors I'll need one of
these uh weed
Pickers I'm telling you the future is
indoor Farms because I think that people
will grow their own food because our
food supply is so unhealthy so I think
the big push for growing your own
food is going to be Health uh not cost
or convenience also maybe for
emergencies in case things go wrong well
on the positive side for energy Bill
Gates Terra power plant uh it's a Next
Generation nuclear power plant um
applied to start construction it's a
sodium cooled
reactor and it would be in Wyoming and
uh it would be about half the cost of a
regular power
plant it could be half the cost and uh
blah blah blah yeah so that's a big deal
there's a whole bunch of stuff happening
in nuclear but this is one of
them so I'm glad we have some
billionaires who can put gigantic
amounts of money into things that take
20 years to build
so I don't know what you would do if you
didn't have billionaires government
would do it well I guess the government
would do it faster to be like
China uh there's a Chinese Auto
executive who warns that uh there's a
let's see what word did he use huh he
said there's a blood bath coming for
American Auto
industry because his cars are so good
that the us is going to have an
automotive bloodbath he's the CEO of uh
xang
Motors how do you pronounce that xpg X
gang I don't know but it's a blood bath
because they're bringing their cheap EVS
over here he
says so I hope the mainstream media
doesn't take him out of contacts
if you know what I
mean all right um Mario nol warns us
that over on YouTube there's a fake um
there's a fake video of a gentleman
named Michael
sailor who's famous for talking about
Bitcoin but uh he's been altered by AI
to appear to ask people to scan a code
on their
screen and it's all a big
scam and apparently it's just been
running at the time of the some time I
saw the post from Mario it had been
running for over an
hour so YouTube doesn't have what x has
which is community
notes so so there's not immediately a
comment saying oh this is a scam it's
deep fake how many people do you think
fell for it on YouTube today and it
might even still be there I don't know
it was up for an hour maybe I kept going
but uh this is going to be really really
dangerous I have to say it didn't look
real to
me but it was close and I could imagine
how people would think it was real but
you know may maybe if I didn't know it
wasn't real when I saw it I would have
thought it was real but I was already
primed to know it
wasn't all right uh Scotland I don't
know if you know that Scotland doesn't
have free speech
anymore you can actually go to jail for
saying things the government doesn't
like you
saying in Scotland boy you how quickly
you can lose all your rights now
obviously we've we've lost our uh most
of our rights here in the United States
as well but uh yeah police off this Ian
miles Chong was talking about this on X
the police officers in Scotland can look
at your social media and if you said
something that they considered a hate
crime and and that could be anything
that would be let's say uh threatening
and
abusive that is communicated through
public performance or play or the
internet so what would be threatening
and
abusive in the government's opinion
that's a little bit uh little dangerous
don't you think do you think the
government could say that well well
let's use me for
example let's use me if if I'd said
everything I've ever said in America uh
if I said it under Scotland's current
law do you think they could have picked
anything I ever said something is there
anything I've ever said that they could
have defined in their personal opinions
as threatening and abusive of course I
could everybody who says anything
interesting could be interpreted as as
threatening and
abusive so the the real effect of it is
a complete end to free speech so Great
Britain has largely Fallen
in terms of a free country I think I
think they're
dead but scollins in bad shape all right
Peter Navaro apparently has lost all of
his challenges and will be reporting to
jail Peter Navaro if you don't know will
be a political prisoner of the Biden
Administration now you could say but
Scott technically there was a crime for
obstructing Congress or something to
which I say yeah and you all know that
nobody else would have been prosecuted
Peter Navaro is a political prisoner in
the United States in
2024 and I'll say it again I only have
one reason for supporting Trump you know
there are other advantages but if Trump
is going to free the political prisoners
I don't need to hear anything
else I really don't because this is top
priority you can't put people in
prison for a political reason re and
still have a country you got to fix this
first everything
else is good too but you know I don't
even care is basically just this it's my
top thing used to be fental I used to
say fenel is my top thing but once I
learned that the fenel problem is coming
from the United States and it's a choice
you know that
right the Press has told you the fenel
is are problem of China selling
precursors to the cartels and then they
sell it in and there's nothing we can do
about it but that's before you
understood you know the entire blob
octopus mechanism it it's pretty obvious
I would consider it a confirmed fact
that the fenel business is allowed by
some some entity in our government is
allowing it expressly and it must be
allowed because we're working some kind
of arrangement with the cartels
and that means we're getting something I
hope I hope we're getting something in
return it's probably control over the
countries that the cartels operate in
because the cartels control their own
governments and we'd like to control the
governments in some cases too so we can
do business and all that keep China out
that sort of stuff so we probably just
have a deal with the cartels that if
they do a few things that we need like
don't attack American
corporations don't let Chinese or the
Russians take over your
country um then we probably just let
them operate we meaning you know our CIA
Etc
so um since that's not solvable by Trump
or anybody else uh my biggest issue is
the political prisoners so I'm going to
read in full Peter Navarro's statement
uh and of number one respect and number
two it's important is this the most
interesting news you're going to hear
today nope it's just really really
important you need to understand that
this is happening he's be he was hunted
just like thousands of January 6 people
there's now some influencer who had you
know just a
glancing contact with the protest I
guess walk might have walked into the
building for 90 seconds and out and that
will you know maybe go to
jail yeah all of this has to end the
political prisoners here is a statement
by Peter Navaro today regarding the
Supreme Court decision which um uh it's
a statement after Justice John Roberts
rejected his uh his ability to be
released pending
appeal keep that in mind here's a
nonviolent
crime that most people say shouldn't
even been charged and he doesn't doesn't
get to remain free
while he's appealing
it I didn't even know that was a
thing since when do you not get Freedom
when you're appealing for a
nonviolent
crime is that is that a standard
procedure I don't know if I've ever even
heard of it I mean so I wouldn't even
need to hear anything else I wouldn't
even need to know what Peter Navaro did
or didn't do if he told me that he can't
be free well he's appealing
something that's completely
nonviolent that's
crazy all right so here's what Peter
Navaro
says justice Roberts took care to note
that his reason for denial was quote
distinct from my pending Appeal on the
merits that Appeal on the merits will
continue and if I fail in that appeal
after nonetheless serving my full prison
term just note that
that by the time the appeal is completed
whether he wins or not he will have
served his entire prison
term that means that the justice has
removed his ability to appeal in a
meaningful
way can you even hold that in your head
my head is
exploding they're going to make him
serve his entire
time while The appeal's Happening
for a non nonviolent crime while people
who are killing people are getting like
you know smaller sentences and freed and
well I'm exaggerating a little bit but
you know what I mean people doing way
worse crimes are out on peole so in our
in
our I I don't even know what to say
about this this is this
is certainly not the worst thing that's
ever happened in America in terms of the
number of people involved
but it might be the worst thing that's
ever happened in
America because this goes right to the
basic concept of the whole country right
now I'm not going to say it's worse than
you know giving diseases to the Tuskegee
AR people it's not worse than it's not
worse than slavery so there there are
other things that are worse in terms of
scale but in terms of a direct attack on
the central promise of
America this is quite the gut
punch I feel this
personally I feel this completely
personally this this isn't just a story
I'm reading in the news this is I could
be next do you have do you realize how
easily they could pick me up on some
 put me in
prison do you realize how close that is
this is completely personal to me
all right reading rest after nonetheless
serving my full prison term the
Constitutional separation of powers will
be irreparably damaged and the doctrine
of executive privilege which is what he
was claiming dating back to George
Washington will cease to function as an
important safeguard for Effective
presidential decision-making there is
much at stake here and is worth the
fight I'm actually surprised he's he
took it as far as he did but I respect
it
the partisan nature of the imprisoning
of a top senior White House Aid should
chill the bones of every American it
does in Joe Biden's weaponized justice
system a Democrat controlled Congress
and justice department together with an
obama-appointed district judge and three
Obama appointed appeals court judges
drove the Navaro railroad right into
prison if anybody thinks these partisans
and politicians and robes aren't coming
for Donald Trump they must think twice
now I'll give you Joel Pollock's opinion
on this uh he talking about Navaro he
says when he arrives in prison uh Peter
Navaro will be a political prisoner he
defied a spena from a one-sided show
trial that broke its own rules and later
destroyed evidence all
true dog allowed actual contempt by Lois
learner and Eric Holder to go
unpunished uh his sentence meaning
Navaro is is our
disgrace agreed this is a
disgrace I don't feel good to be an
American that's for
sure because whatever America was when I
was a kid maybe it never was I don't
know but it's definitely not
this this
is It's the depth of
evil this is a signal that there's no
liit to what they will do this tells you
there's no
limit yeah so when you see a whistle
blower allegedly committed suicide in
his car how do you believe that when
Peter Navaro was being put in prison
they tell us that our elections were
perfectly uh clean how do you believe
the elections were clean when they're
putting Peter Navaro in prison
I don't I think that's good enough to
assume that everything's
riged when you watch this happen you can
it's sort of like in um a court case
where they say if the if the witness has
lied about one thing and you know that
that's a lie you're you should think
that everything else the witness says is
not credible and so I do so because of
Peter Navaro I now disbelieve 100% of
everything my stupid government
and Department of Justice says because
they've given me permission to distrust
everything good job good
job so this has to be fixed and uh let
let me let me go through the arguments
against uh Trump blah blah blah he lied
that time I don't care blah blah blah
stormy
yeah I don't care I don't care blah blah
blah he said those things that made us
upset don't care don't care uh he may
have technically broken some kind of law
that nobody ever has been charged with
before don't care he may have taken some
documents that technically could be
considered by some people to be
classified but other people say
no don't care he may have overvalued
some of his assets and a completely
normal way that everybody in the
industry
does don't care he may have said bad
things about somebody uh that he
allegedly had some interaction with but
maybe didn't because it doesn't sound
real to me I don't
care I don't care Peter Navaro
is in
prison Peter Navaro is in prison that
that might be my answer to every your
remaining online convers
oh Scott why do you believe this
conspiracy theory about the government
because Peter Navaro is in
prison that gives me permission to
believe everything's
corrupt that is permission to believe
everything is corrupt and so I do and so
I do it's this flipping a little switch
inside my head I'll tell you if this
doesn't change everything for
you wa till they put Trump in
prison see field
then well as you know wokeness is a form
of self
harm and a mental illness and you can
see it in in every way that it comes
out let me give you another example uh
the Washington state has decided that
you could be a lawyer there uh without
passing the bar
exam why are they doing that is that to
help marginalize people cuz that's what
they say no it's just self harm it's
just self
harm why why would you want to go from a
system where your lawyers are uh
verified to have a certain level of
capability to a system where they don't
and your life depends on
it it's self harm why do we keep the uh
the Border
open it's self
harm there was a ruling today some judge
said that uh people were in the country
illegally also have the right to own
firearms in this
country why would you make a ruling like
that self
harm right they all have the same
quality yeah you don't have to look very
far for it it's all self harm this is
some kind of guilt you know white guilt
from I don't know slavery or just all
the the media pecking on them for
decades whatever it is
but uh no the the you can
guarantee that um the people who were in
The woke state will pick whatever is the
most harm to
themselves now I'm not arguing that it's
not good for the other
people it is good for
them it's definitely good for the people
that trying to help except that it
always has the quality that's bad for
the people who are already here and
people who are making these policies the
self harm is
crazy all right meanwhile uh Barack
Obama uh had some meeting with the UK
prime minister that was let's say uh
undisclosed in terms of the why of it
and he's meeting with I don't know some
some royal family in Belgium or
something so apparently he's over over
in Europe doing something that looks
like a Statesman kind of a
visit ahead of the election what do you
think that's about
well let me see if Peter Navaro were not
just being put in jail what I would say
about that is huh he's just an
ex-president who knows a lot of people
and maybe he wants to stay connected and
it's sort of a social visit and maybe
they invited him for coffee and he just
said yes maybe he was going to be there
anyway and you he got an invitation and
he thought oh that'd be a good idea I'll
say hi it could be that if if Peter and
Navaro were not in jail that's what I'd
say but Peter Naro is in jail or going
to
jail so you know what I say I say it
looks like Obama is working an op in
which he couldn't say it on the phone so
he had to go there in person and the
reason he's there in person is to push
some kind of an op in which our our uh
foreign allies in this case the UK maybe
the five eyes in general will do some
kind of spying on our behalf or come up
with some kind of to take
account Trump I assume that this is all
about putting Trump in jail for reasons
that they have not yet come up with do
you know why I think that because Peter
Navaro is going to
jail so don't even don't even ask me to
believe that the that the government is
doing anything honest ever I don't even
want to hear the argument you've lost
You've Lost That privilege you've lost
the privilege of the benefit of a doubt
right if you want it back maybe release
the political prisoners then we can talk
but for now I'm just assuming the worst
and I think that's a smart
assumption all right uh you want some
good
news maybe you could you can see this as
good news or bad news uh I see it as
fake
news probably fake so there's report
from Bloomberg but nobody
else uh that a credible source is saying
that Trump has ruled out vake as his
vice president but uh he's looking at
him for a potential cabinet job
now is that
true there's one source as Bloomberg go
is that
true well I guess anything's possible
but Bloomberg is not a credible source
uh for news do you know how I know that
I once made the mistake of allowing a
Bloomberg journalist to spend the day
with me to write a feature story about
me when I didn't realize so this was
like 2016 is I know somewhere around
then and I didn't realize at the time
that it was just to take me out do you
think that they printed the story
accurately and got all the details right
of course not did they even try didn't
look like it it didn't look like were
trying to do it
honestly so what they did with me my
impression of it was it was a political
hit job in the guise of publication so
that's how you should look at this story
maybe it's true but maybe Bloomberg just
made this up like they do other
stuff because they are not a credible
publication yeah they are not
credible so but let's talk about it if
and and then the rumor says that H um
the homeland security might be the
cabinet job that V is being considered
for now I could definitely go for
that I don't know what it would take to
be in charge of that big sprawling you
know
organization but uh yeah I could go for
that I don't know if a vake would go for
it but if you if you airdrop a vake into
a uh Homeland
Security that's some
fun that that would be some fun I think
we'd find out some things that we didn't
know about and I think there'd be a lot
fewer people there when he was done I
think a lot would get fixed pretty
quickly so uh so my two thoughts about
it number one it's not a credible report
but number
two if he ended up you a powerful
cabinet position country would do well
with that that could be really
good speaking of aake he was on CNN with
Abby
Phillip um and Abby is one of the
spreaders of the fine people hoax what
happens if you if you're a correspondent
type on
CNN and you spread the fine people hoax
what happens to you promoted promoted
got her own show so now Abby Philip BR
of the fin people hoax has her own show
and she made the mistake of having
Theon and ask him to comment about
Trump's use of the word
vermin now that is a good gotcha for the
usual dumbasses in
Congress right if you bring in some like
P
who who just looks good in a suit has
good hair so what do you think about
this verman thing and they're going to
they're going to address the question
they're going to treat it like it's an
important enough question to actually
answer it well you know what he meant
was this and what he didn't mean was
that and you know you have to look at it
in the big
picture no all wrong what you do is you
take off your pants and you turn around
and you in their mouth because
that's what they ask
for that's what they deserve they don't
deserve an answer to that question
that's how you do you still be your wife
kind of question no you should
just unload on how unscrupulous and
terrible and evil they are and then say
what you want to say so that's what V
did he in her mouth and then he
said what he wanted to say and he
reminded everybody that the news is
useless fake crap and that you know
making you argue over the use of a word
is the least useful thing the news could
do thank you you
for thank you it was
delicious yes so no um that is exactly
the way you should treat people who are
not serious people who spread the fine
people hoax um basically racist so
that's why you should treat
them um did you know that Haiti shares a
border with the Dominican
Republic uh and did you know that the
Dominican Republic built a 12T fall 12T
wall to keep the Haiti immigrants from
Crossing
so so it's they call the Smart Security
Fence it's got drones and cameras and
whatnot so do you do you know why the
Dominican Republican is putting up a
fence and we're looking to fly them in
do you know what the difference
is is it because we're much kinder
no it's self harm it's self harm we're
we're less interested in helping them
than we are in hurting ourselves whereas
the Dominican Republic is saying hey
what's good for the Dominican Republic
well we we we also care about the
Haitians But first you know first we're
going to take care of the Dominican
Republican but we're doing the opposite
we're looking at what's good for them
and uh
secondarily well who cares what's good
for us it's self harm yeah just self
harm so you'll see that in every one of
the woke decisions they all they all
self harm and fairly obviously and
blatantly and it's from the people who
cut themselves and put piercings in
painful places and you know it's the
same people the the people who for
whatever reason think that they need to
be punished and you do too because you
look a little bit like
them that's what it feels
like all right
um now Trump's getting in trouble
for uh the saying that uh let's see he
said if you're a Democrat and uh if you
vote for the Democrats and you're Jewish
it means you hate Israel and you hate
your religion or something like that he
goes any Jewish person that votes for
Democrats hates their religion Trump
said
uh and they hate everything about Israel
they should be ashamed of themselves
because Israel will be destroyed under
Democratic
Leadership um and he talked about Iran's
Ambitions to get nukes
Etc
so how was that treated well the news
put it in context said you have to
understand his bad comments uh compared
to their other hoaxes so they compared
it to the neo-nazis people hoax and said
that if you look at his comment about
Jewish voters it has to be understood in
the context of their
hoax that's really happening they're
really telling you you have to
understand his current comments in the
context of their hoax the same thing
they did with all of Trump's comments
All of Trump's comments they put through
the filter of their other
hoaxes well if he hadn't done January 6
you mean you're hoax about it well if he
hadn't said the fine people you mean
you're hoax that he said it didn't
actually say
that so they've actually got the full
wrapup hoax thing working for their
people who are apparently idiots um who
believe
it uh I saw a post from Ian Carroll just
somebody on the
xplatform and uh he's got some
suspicions that the real reason for the
the interest in the ticktock ban right
now when that topic has been sort of
floating around for years and suddenly
everybody got religion on it and he says
uh this is his theory that uh the guy
who introduced it Mike Gallagher is a
major he gets major support from APAC a
is Israel uh let's say lobbying lobbying
is the right word
so they're a pro-israel lobbying group
that has a lot of influence in the
government and so uh Ian Carol is
suspecting that really what's happening
is that Israel wants to ban Tik Tock in
the United States because tikto had a
lot of pro Palestinian stuff and it was
very bad for Israel especially in the
time of middle of a hot war and so he
thinks that uh you like many many of you
suspicious people think hey maybe the
Jews are really behind this whole
ticktock ban he says let me give you
some clarity on that of course they
are of course they are what was that
supposed to be a
secret the Tik Tock just completely put
a monkey wrench in their hot
War what are they supposed to be for
it how how would they not be against it
now the reason that we know that Mike
Gallagher has money from APAC is because
it's public information it's public
information it's
transparent we we don't like
this we give to these politicians these
politicians agree with us maybe for
money maybe they agree anyway it's all
kind of
public here's the problem if I disagreed
with
Israel well maybe I'd have a problem
with it
but why would I be mad if they're on my
side I'm on the same side I I think Tic
Tac ticktock tiktock is a menace to
America so yeah it's probably true that
Israel is putting the pressure on it's
probably true that in the context of a
hot War when we see the Palestinian
propaganda and we see how the machine
works it not only made a clear and
present danger to our Ally Israel
uh but it it had the double benefit of
showing you how dangerous Tik Tock could
be in the middle of AA
War so I don't think this is so much a
clever conspiracy theory that's been
uncovered as exactly what it looks
like Israel would of course not want the
CCP to be able to manage the algorithm
America separate from Israel would of
course not want that to happen and I
separate from both of them just as a
citizen uh I don't want tick talked out
of that
power so
um a lot of the anti- uh anti-israel
anti-jewish
stuff is because people are seeing
patterns and they think the pattern is
telling them something and it might be
telling them something
different every time you see Jewish
people do something that's
smart and right in front of you like
it's public such as many Jewish people
leading big
organizations maybe it's because smart
people do smart
things like how does that not explain
everything you see smart people doing
smart things if you were good at
school you you do good in school and you
get a good job and then you have power
over lots of stuff that's how you get
power you work hard and go to school and
get the right kind of
education so you should see Jewish
Americans in all kinds of important
roles and when they act in a way that's
pro-israel it's always
transparent you you can you can see it
exactly who's getting paid what why
they're doing it what they've said
before and they are an ally right so
there's plenty of things you can
complain about and I have right you know
it's not I'm not agreeing with
everything Israel's ever done that's not
my
job uh but I do like that it's
transparent so that's
something I would like the job of a I
would like a cabinet position myself I'd
like to be the Secretary of debunking
hoaxes now I wouldn't be the best for
that job I would recommend Steve
Cortez but we should actually
have a cabinet position for debunking
hoaxes why not it's the most important
thing happening because Trump is barely
terrible at it if I may say Trump is
terrible at debunking his own hoaxes
he's really bad at it other people do it
better and you know Joel Pollock is
another one people who have written
about you know the various hoaxes
against Trump so if they're not
available you know if Joel and Steve
don't want the job I'd like to be the
Secretary of debunking hoaxes now I
won't take a salary it won't cost you a
penny I'll do it for
free uh the condition is I don't have to
commute no commuting so no pay no
commuting I don't want to go to meetings
and uh Lord knows you don't want to have
me on any Zoom
calls say no more say no more and and um
I think I would be called the Secretary
of debunking
hoaxes and it would be the most uh
important job in the
administration which is weird because it
might actually be the most important job
in the administration if if Trump could
become president and then there would be
an
actual literally a cabinet position to
debunk all the hoaxes it would really
really help them so I say it
jokingly but in the real world it would
work
it would actually work because the the
news wouldn't be able to leave it alone
would they imagine if it were announced
new cabinet position uh the Secretary of
debunking
hoaxes his first job will be to find
people
hoax then he'll be moving on to
bloodbath
Etc all
right
um so apparently there's a new survey
and uh we got big problems with men and
women in the United States because uh
76% of women said they would reject a
potential date because the person was
magga 60% of women said they would
reject anybody who said all lives
matter what's that sound like 60% would
reject you for a date if she said all
lives
matter does that sound like people who
prefer self
Farm because if you don't think your own
life matters literally you don't think
your own life matters and that people
could say that out loud that's a
preference for self
harm well once you see the pattern you
see it it just so clearly it's all just
self harm it's mental health uh dressed
up as something else it's just bad
mental
health all right uh let's see
um so as you know the Black and Hispanic
vote seems to be moving a little bit
toward Trump maybe a lot uh so Nate
silver who's good with the statistic
stuff you probably know um he said Biden
is now only winning Hispanics by seven
percentage points and that's down from
winning them by 24 points in
20120 so four years of calling Trump a
racist result resulted in Far More
Hispanics
support far
more
meanwhile uh black voters
uh so Biden is winning with black voters
by 55% he has 55 um points as compared
to he was up 83 points in
2020 so dropping from an
83% point to 55
that's a total
collapse and during that time the
mainstream media was non-stop saying
that Trump was a
racist and during that time he picked up
massive black
support do you think the public is
starting to figure out that the news
isn't
real I feel like they're getting the
hint and I'll tell you nothing has been
more powerful when I get into an
argument with a crazy Democrat
than to
say you still think the news is
real because that actually is the whole
argument for every topic okay hold on
you think the news is
real it's just a total uh conversation
stopper you should not have an any kind
of uh discussion with somebody who
thinks the news is real you can't really
have
one you have to the the opening bid deit
conversation with me about politics used
to understand that the news isn't even
intending to be real and I don't know
when it was if it ever was I don't know
if it changed or we just found out about
it anyway
um so uh attorney former Attorney
General Eric Holder was on Bill Marsh
show on Friday and it's funny how how
blatantly they can say what's going on
listen how blatant this is so holder
said a quote there's work to be done but
I'm actually optimistic he's talking
about how Biden was down in the polls so
Biden's down in the polls but he says
there's work to be done but I'm actually
optimistic that if we stay committed
focused and as the media turns its
attention to making this a binary choice
between a person who's got some age and
cognitive issues that would be
Trump
against somebody who has actually
accomplished a lot I think we'll do just
fine now the important part of that
sentence you should have caught is that
as the media turns its
attention Biden will go up in the
polls he's actually saying out
loud that the media will determine the
vote there's no other way to interpret
that he's saying that the media at the
the way they're covering it right now
has Biden down and when they cover it
differently and by differently I mean
the way Democrats want them to cover it
and they're very confident that the
media will start covering it the way
Democrats want them to cover it that's
what he's saying and that that will
change the election result he's saying
directly that the voters are just
Downstream from the opinion given to
them by the news he's saying it directly
there's no other way to interpret this
that the news
will change the vote and he's not even
worried because he knows that by
election day the news will have done
this
job all
right um there's a new Kraken update
Kraken of course being the uh alleged
future claim that uh maybe something
will be found about the old 2020
election to prove that it was rigged
which has not been done yet so we don't
have proof of that but very interesting
developments so there's an election
Integrity attorney who works for
election Integrity group called
Stephanie Lambert who got picked up and
arrested in Washington DC now she's one
of the people you know claiming that the
election has irregularities and she got
picked up on some unrelated
charge uh which is suspicious in itself
because we we ask ourselves would that
have happened if she were not working on
this election Integrity thing would
everybody have been treated that
way in a normal World I'd say well
that's probably a coincidence she did
something wrong and it that's just when
they picked her
up in the context of Peter Navaro being
going to
prison I say it's illegitimate and is
lawfare that's my assumption because
that's where we are if anybody wants me
to assume differently then maybe you
should help me get the political
prisoners out of jail because to me it
looks like another political
prisoner I don't I don't think she spent
any time in jail but she got picked up
for something some something she did in
the course of her job
anyway here's what has allegedly been
discovered from quote leaked documents
from De Dominion voting systems now in
order for me to stay on a jail and not
be sued let me say that I'm only
reporting what other people are saying
and my own opinion of whether it's valid
or true is somewhat
irrelevant uh but I'll just tell you and
you can make up your own mind so there
are leaked documents allegedly about uh
regarding Dominion voting
systems um and let me
read the one
sentence that I hope I wrote down
oh darn it uh but there are two
different systems uh oh here it is so
this is an actual line from uh some
people who were talking about I don't
know some testing or something with the
Dominion
machines and quote this is in writing
and we have this now we have two
different systems flagging logins from
Kosovo
Serbia just need to ensure that they are
really no who's somebody they're working
with if not we'll disable the
account wait what there's somebody in a
foreign
country that
had access to the
machines a
non-american and there might have been
two logins from over there and they're
trying to make sure if it's the one
non-american that they know about or
some other
non-american
now I think you need to hear the other
side of the story before you you have a
final
judgment and I don't think this quite
qualifies as a kraken
but do you think it's
true that a Serbian was accessing the
Dominion machines and they were aware of
it it was just part of their ongoing
process and that somebody from Serbia
could call in and change something on
the
machine so I don't know how much uh
importance to put on this I I think the
only thing that
feels true is that there might have been
a non-american who was involved with
access to the machines which would be
something you'd ask some questions
about so I think it's short of any I
think it's short of
proof um and I think Dominion safe so
far that they'll probably just say ah it
was normal but that's going on Kyle
Becker's on
this so PE people have look the people
who have looked at it think they have
something I have not looked at it in
enough detail to know that that's true
but I warn you as with all election
irregularity stories that at least 95%
of them will turn
out to not pan out and we don't know
about this
one all right Thomas Massie said this to
scare us all he said I've come to the
conclusion that an economic catastrophe
must have happen before a majority of my
colleagues that's in the Congress will
get serious about Curbing and a control
government spending so he says that
short of an economic collapse uh the
government will never take seriously
cutting expenses what do you think of
that I
agree yeah we've developed a system that
guarantees economic
collapse because the responsibility is
too
distributed so any one person can
saywell it wasn't
me it wasn't me I I I kept saying they
should cut those other expenses but I
didn't get a choice so I had to I had to
vote for the bill that was there because
it's not what I wanted but it's the only
Bill I had it was either shut the
government or vote for the bill so we've
designed a system which guarantees that
the people in charge of budget and
fiscal uh responsibility it guarantees
they'll do the
opposite the system guarantees that
we'll run up massive debts and not be
able to do anything about it now the
only counter to Thomas massie's point
which I totally get is that it's a
straight line
projection meaning it assumes that
things just sort of stay the same until
we fall off the
edge now normally I would mock that kind
of prediction except that it's part of a
system that guarantees you get there if
it were not part of a system that kind
of guarantees it's going to happen it's
not just something you're guessing from
the the free market or you know the you
know some unpredictable thing in the
real world this is very
predictable it it's it's been a straight
line March for 40 years right more debt
more debt no there's no indication
whatsoever that there's anybody in
congress who's willing to you know work
on it uh at their own personal risk in
the short run so here we get to compare
what I call the Adams law of slow-moving
disasters to this
prediction now this is this might be the
hardest one now remember I always say
that if everybody can see the same
problem coming and we all know it's
coming and we all agree what it is and
exactly what it is you know there's no
about what it is under those conditions
we always find a
solution but this one's weird because
the problem is in the design of a system
that is our government our government
itself so is there anybody powerful
enough to change the incentive of every
member of the government or at least a
majority that's a pretty big ask but
here are the things which could happen
that are not a straight
line um
projection I think there's a good chance
money will become
useless and there goes your
debt now in other words the people who
are owed the money at some point might
say ah just keep it I couldn't spend it
anyway it doesn't have any
value now that's because it might be
something about Bitcoin it might be
something about Ai and robots uh um I
had I had said that I thought um
whatever money of the future will be
digital and it will be backed by robot
labor robot labor because that would be
the only thing that had lasting
value and and maybe land land and robot
value but then I saw um Sam mman clip in
which he was saying that the great
economic unit in the future might be
computer processing because you need the
these you know massive data centers to
run the robots I like I like his take
maybe a little bit better than my own
because here's here's where I was blind
I was kind of imagining that the robot
was its own separate
entity but really it might be more
proper to think of the robot as part of
the data center like it's all One Design
does that make sense because the data
center is probably going to give it its
AI it's probably going to be updating it
keeping it running Etc so the the robot
will probably just always be attached to
a data center that's processing all the
time so it might be that
compute compute power is the only
economic value in the future or the
thing that we base a currency on so I'm
going to say that the atoms law of slow
moving disasters does suggest that we'll
get out of it I think the fact that El
Salvador went to bitcoin and may be able
to pay off all of their foreign debts
with Bitcoin because Bitcoin just went
up in
value I think that might change people's
minds about what money is
worth so I do feel bad that I worked all
my life to uh get money when it doesn't
have any
value um however I guess I would ask
this question if if money stopped having
value because it was replaced with some
digital thing um stocks would still be
worth something right as long as they
were making money
well as long as they're making some form
of money whether it's the US dollar or
something else so I think owning stocks
still makes sense because if all the
companies in the United States go
broke well you're screwed anyway there's
nothing you can do so I'm going to I
think I'm going to put my bet down on
the Adams law of slow moving disasters
taking care of our national debt but not
by paying it
off I think by making it useless
sometime in the future I think that's
what's going to
happen anyway so just to scare you in
case you were thinking of
investing uh speaking of stuff like that
Trump apparently won't be able to make
his
bond so he had to get over $400
million uh and now a bond what a bond is
is a shortterm way to get some money
it's almost like a
loan uh that if you were to default on
whatever whatever it is he's supposed to
do that he would lose the value of the
uh the bond anyway but no insurance
company those are the people who issue
Bond um that kind of bond uh no
insurance company wants to get
involved why do you think they don't
want to get involved do you think
because they don't think they can make
money or do you think it's because if
they help president trump it will be so
bad for business and their employees
will be so mad that they just can't
handle
it it is a loan it's a loone it's a
loone in a sense so the way a bond Works
um has some loan qualities but let me
explain it this way so I had to get a
bond when I built my house that
protected some trees on the property
that the the My Town said uh you can't
hurt those
trees and you have to put up a bond
so that meant I had to pay um some
amount of money to a company that would
issue a
bond that if I cut down that tree and I
didn't pay for it myself that the bond
company would pay it and you know so
they they basically take a risk and they
can put money
forward now in my case I think I I did
the bond myself so I gave I had to give
the city
$225,000 that they would just hold in
escrow until I was done with
construction and I could prove that the
tree was still
there so it's not it's not exactly a
loan but there's some loan likee
qualities to
it all right so it's more like insurance
it's sort of a combo Insurance Plus a
loan you know hybrid kind of thing
anyway insurance companies won't touch
it I assume it's because the mainstream
media has demonized Trump to that
point but here's the thing whoever sells
him a bond is going to make a lot of
money
fast because in order to get a 400
million
Bond he's probably going to have to pay
$10
million that just never comes back now
I'm making up the 10 million but it's
something like that is anybody in is
anybody in the bond business what do you
think it would cost a man of pocket to
get the bond company or insurance
company to ensure his potential risk 10
million you say
5% so 20 million you think 20 million
you think 40 million
10% yeah so somewhere in that range you
know maybe it's negotiable $10 to $40
million
and your risk would be that he never
uh that he never paid any money that he
was due after repeals and everything
which would be a big risk but he does
have assets to back
it so I wonder if there's some way that
his um his
fans and backers could put together a
fund that would do this function and
they could make some
money so so Suppose there was who knows
I I assume this is all illegal because
you'd have to set up as an insurance
company and get there there's probably a
whole bunch of legal Hoops you'd have to
go through to be in this business so to
speak but in
theory um if somebody said Scott would
you put up $100 in some kind of
GoFundMe if you knew that it um at the
end you could get $110
back to which I'd say yeah sure because
I think the odds of getting $10 back are
pretty good and if I lost $110 I could
still survive and I think it would be
the right thing to
do yeah I'd put it in
$100 so I don't know if there's any
option for you know group funding of
that but um I don't know if we could get
to 400
million but we might what what is uh 81
million what's 80 million if 80 million
people would have to pay uh do the math
how much would each of his supporters
have to pay to get to 400
million
all right well you can do the math
yourself all
right uh someone asked can you break out
of the
simulation if if we're part of a
simulation we're not real we're zeros
and ones can you break out of
it what do you think if we're a
simulation do you think there' be a way
to find a find an error in it and break
out well I think the way you break out
might be dying
I don't recommend it but you know I
always have this thought that when you
die in this life you wake up in a chair
in the other life and you've got some
sensors on your head you're like oh
where was I and then they tell you that
you were in the
simulation and it was like a game and
then I say well how long was I there and
they say well in the time span of the
simulation you were there for a 100
years but in our world it was only a
minute and a half because time is
different you know in our world so
you're under you're gone for a minute
and a half you've lived an entire life
you come back with a bunch of memories
and learnings you're smarter you've had
all this experience but it took a minute
and a half now I'm not going to predict
that that's what really happens it's
just a fun thought
however I would I would challenge you on
the following thought
have you ever noticed that the people
who really believe in the
simulation are doing unusually well in
life now Elon Musk is the obvious one
for that and I've done okay and I also
literally believe we're in a simulation
not
figuratively and I wonder if you studied
all the people who believe we are in a
simulation if you would find that
they're doing better
and here's why I think that's important
I think that you can't get out of the
simulation but you can hack
it I think you can hack it with your uh
mindset and I think that since we know
that
Consciousness can um collapse a wave we
know that observing something makes it
real for the first
time is it a big stretch to say that the
way you're thinking could change what
becomes
real if you accept the magic
trick that observation makes something
real for the first time which is what
physics tells us that things aren't real
they're only potential until they're
observed or measured and measured makes
it real in the sense that somebody could
check the measurement later if they
wanted to so I don't think it's a big
leap to say you can author your own life
by thinking your way to a better
situation
now some of it might be just built into
the fact that a positive attitude would
make you try more things and put more
energy into it maybe that's all you need
to succeed maybe the world just rewards
people who have that
mindset but I would look for the
correlation yeah look for the
correlation of people who think we are
in simulation and have unusually good
outcomes yeah and I put myself in that
category my life is so strange the
unusual outcomes I've
had so I was asked earlier if I could
have more
positivity in our negative
World well yes here's some positivity I
do think that we will invent our way out
of most of our problems from our you
know food sour being poisoned to our
sources of you know so so you heard
stories about that would improve far
fing with our fertilizer uh we'll have
more energy if the Bill Gates thing
works out and it causes more of a
Floodgate Of more nuclear stuff so we
are we do look like we're heading in the
right direction on
energy I think we're definitely heading
in the right direction on we will head
in the right direction on the border
because Trump is leading in the polls so
in all
likelihood we're we have a solution
coming for that and it should it should
end the question for forever right we
knew what happened when we let opened
the
Border we'll choose not to do that again
so there are a whole bunch of things
that are trending right um the one that
bothers me the most is the debt so I
agree with Massie on that but we have
had
time we've had enough time to think
about it and I think that we'll probably
figure a way
out don't know how it might be hard but
I think we
will um
so I'm looking for a big Improvement in
government by you know by the by this
time next year and I think the Ukraine
war most questions have now been
answered meaning that it's not going to
turn
nuclear because why would it right the
any reason that it ever had to become
nuclear are now gone right Putin has
essentially accomplished what he needs
to accomplish we just need to recognize
it figure out how to wind things
up so all right I'm seeing people say
that uh CIA won't let Trump
win well you know what I would have said
that except that we're all watching now
I don't know how they could do that and
not have every single person know
exactly what happened I I feel as though
uh if they try to take Trump out it
doesn't matter who pulls the
trigger you're just going to
think you're going to think it was the
CIA so I don't think they can get away
with
it unless they have so much power that
they can do it right in front of us and
just say nah that didn't happen even if
we know it
did Supersonic missiles would be enough
yeah but he doesn't need to do that
because it would destroy Russia
too uh you think they'll make it look
like an accident nobody would believe
the accident either nobody's going to
believe a plane wreck that's for
sure although they are huh if ever there
was going to be a trump plane rre the
best time to do it would be after you've
primed the public that the planes are
all falling
apart
H we are being primed that the airplanes
are not
safe that is a little suspicious yeah
I'd be worried about that actually but I
think we'll be
okay I think that if you get your
mindsight right you'll be in good shape
now here's something I would love to see
this will never happen so you got a
bunch of
podcasters who say lots of
stuff and don't you wonder which of them
are making their audiences happier and
healthier don't you wonder about that
because I'm pretty sure that my audience
has lost weight and quit drinking you
not everybody but more than the
average I'm pretty sure you were taking
Vitamin D supplements the first week of
the pandemic because I mentioned it so
often
and I I think you have a whole bunch of
mindset
advantages from Talent Stacks to systems
being better than Golds Etc so I would
love to if there were some way and there
isn't really to measure the Improvement
in the lives of the Audi
I think I might have the biggest no
maybe not you know I think Jordan
Peterson and you know um Andrew hubman
probably are getting really good results
for their audiences but I think I'm in
the top 10 for somebody who has an
audience that's getting healthier and
getting more wealthier so I'm happy
about
that all right I wish it could be
measured all right that's all I've got
for you today I'm going to say goodbye
to the YouTube and uh and Rumble and X
people and then I'm going to fire up a
separate after show for the locals
people who are
subscribing and we'll chat with them a
little bit and thanks for
joining all right we'll see you tomorrow
same same time same
place
