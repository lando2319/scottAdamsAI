good morning ladies and gentlemen and
welcome to the highlight of civilization
and I haven't checked the news in the
day has anything happened
[Applause]
it's gonna be the best show ever
my God
my God
is is this some kind of gift to me
from the gods of content
have I done something so right all year
that Karma just said whoa whoa whoa
year-end is coming
let's give Scott the best live stream of
all time
and here it is
but this may be a little unbelievable
but I'm going to ask you to suspend your
disbelief
do you think this experience could go
even higher
yes
Carpe and Carby dunk makes it an
appearance
um
and and it's all signs of good news
it's like the the robins of spring
but let's see if we could take this up a
notch
I think we can
and all you need
I'm going to do this in the Joe Biden
whisper
you need a cup or a mug or a glass
a tanker Charles or Stein
a canteen juggler flask
a vessel of any kind
so you have to do that after the whisper
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dope immediate of the
day the the thing that will tweak your
serotonin your oxytocin and possibly the
alcohol in your blood you know I'm not
judging it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
yeah
that is so satisfying I I barely have
the words to describe it
but if I did have the words to describe
it that word would be
ah
well let's see what's in the news uh
uh there's this gentleman I don't know
if you've heard of him
he's getting a little attention lately
uh Andrew Tate Tate
have you heard of him
well he's uh
allegedly arrested in Romania where he
resides
now
here's what you should believe about
this story
nothing
so can can we start off by saying that
if you believe that I believe anything
about the story
you don't know me
of course I don't believe it am I going
to have fun with it and pretend as
though it's true
oh yes I am of course I am do I believe
is true very unlikely hugely unlikely
so I'll tell you what I think is true
best guess but we don't know right it's
all fog of war and mirrors and
and persuasion and counter claims and
yeah there's there's corruption and
lying and there's you know there's his
last arrest has been conflated with his
new arrest and there's stuff about Greta
tunberg and the pizza box which totally
was
how many of you believe
that he was caught by the authorities
because he showed a pizza box on TV that
showed he was in Romania and so that was
how they knew to NAB him
did anybody think that was suspicious
from the jump
no of course that didn't happen
widely reported yes did it happen no
right but Greta Greta treated it like it
was real
so the story yesterday which wasn't real
is that he was so dumb he showed a pizza
box that showed he was in country so
they picked him up and why didn't he
know not to do that how dumb he is so
none of that's true
but uh Greta
being somewhat like me in this regard
decided to treat it as true because it's
funny so let's go with that
and she tweeted this is what happens
when you don't recycle your pizza boxes
because he was joking that he wasn't
going to recycle this pizza box and then
he ended up in Romania jail like a few
hours later
Greta's dunking on him this is what
happens when you don't recycle your
pizza boxes now
do I believe
that Grava comes up with her own Twitter
jokes and tweets on her own
of course not of course not you know I I
don't know I mean I don't rule it out
don't rule it out but it's a little bit
a little bit too good you know what I
mean you know I'm a professional
I I know what I know on a professional
tweet looks like and while Greta has
some game
she she has some game for sure
not quite there
this is a little bit better than her
game so I think she's got some help but
uh it must be qualified help because
they're doing a good job
all right now
one of the versions of the story is that
they uh the Tate brothers and two others
were arrested allegedly
for let's see Fox news is saying as of
this morning
I assume all of this is going to change
like everything you know about this will
be different in an hour but Fox News was
reporting this morning that it was the
The Raid was because uh uh
they're appear they appear appear to
have the dates created an organism
organized crime group with the purpose
of recruiting housing and exploiting
women by forcing them to create
pornographic content meant to be seen A
specialized website blah blah and then
there there's another rumor
that that rumor was completely false
and they were really brought in to
discuss some kind of money laundering
thing which might be part of some larger
investigation of which they would be
just a part of it in which case they
might not even be charged or anything
they might be just Witnesses or people
of Interest or something like that now
is any of that true
assume none of it's true
just just assume everything is untrue
that's your best position at the moment
because very little of it looks true to
me
now you may have seen some videos
they showed them being arrested and then
being released some of those are from
the past so those are not new videos
because they were picked up one other
time and released
so you'll see they're wearing different
clothing uh you see one where he appears
to have handcuffs
but I don't know if that's real
who knows then there's they say that
they found 10 million dollars in cash in
one of his homes
Is that real
do you think if the most corrupt
government in the world
found 10 million dollars of cash
in a an accused criminal's home
do you think that would be accurately
reported
I mean just ask yourself that
10 million dollars in untraceable cash
and they would report exactly how much
they found
I mean just think about it
now if they reported 10
and there was any money there at all
they found 20. you get that right
if they really found if they really
reported 10 and who knows if that's true
and they actually said here's this 10
million
they probably found 20. wink wink all
right because one thing that nobody is
questioning is that Romania is like the
most corrupt place in the world and even
the dates say that directly they say
they chose it because it's one of the
most corrupt places in the world and as
long as you understand that and you have
money it works really well for you
now let me ask you this
in the most corrupt country in the world
let's say it's you know one of the most
in one of the most corrupt countries in
the world
if they pick you up and they know you
have tens of millions of dollars
what are the odds that you will spend a
day in jail
just think about it what are the odds
that somebody with tens of millions of
untraceable cash and probably crypto and
everything else what are the odds that
that guy spends even one day in jail
now allegedly he was in some kind of
jail last night
do you believe he was behind bars last
night
Maybe
I don't know one way or another but it
seems highly unlikely to me
the most likely outcome is that they
handcuffed him brought him into the
police facility
and they said let's talk behind this
closed door and then he would go behind
the closed door it was somebody who was
looking for a very big bribe and the
person looking for the very big bride
would negotiate with them and they say
all right we have to sort of Pretend
We're a real police force
so we'll probably keep you here for a
few hours
but
you know then we'll release you so it
looks like we actually did something but
thanks for the 10 million dollars
why in the world would anybody in the
police force not try to shake him down
apparently there's no
there's nothing to stop everybody in
power from collecting bribes that seems
to be genuinely generally understood
so does anybody think he's going to go
to jail in Romania
it's probably the safest place he could
ever be in fact I would argue that the
safest place Andrew Tate could be in the
entire planet Earth
would be arrested allegedly inside a
Romanian police force
in theory those are the people he owns
or will own in about five minutes
now
here's something else that has to be
injected into the story oh and let me
let me say directly innocent until
proven guilty now you all know that I'm
no fan of the Tates right everybody
knows that so I'm not a supporter
I would love to see them go down because
he's a bad human being and I you know
personal
personal interaction that would be good
enough for me to be happy if something
bad happened to him but he's innocent
until approve and guilty and I've not
seen anything that would
changed my mind on that
now do I think it's unlikely
that there's any illegality going on
oh I would say he's sending strong
signals that there's something going on
yeah if if you were to look for a
glaring signals
there's a little bit too much
unexplained cash floating around in that
situation am I right
so if he could explain
how he has access to so much cash
good luck with that good luck with that
but the fact is there's no evidence of a
crime
having a lot of money is not evidence of
a crime
now I heard on a on a spaces show last
night an expert on financial crimes who
was also an expert on the subcategory of
trafficking because there's usually a
way to catch traffickers is you can
catch them through their financial
transactions now that expert said ooh
everything about this fits the pattern
of some trafficker
Maybe
but that doesn't mean he committed a
crime now here's where it's going to get
really interesting
if it turns out he's
accused of
let's say any kind of forced
sexual activity or forcing anybody to do
anything sexual or there are videos of
him you know having paddled or whipped
women and there's some ambiguity about
their participation in it or whether
they participated like a small level but
he took it too far which would also be a
problem
you know so there's some ambiguity there
but here's what you don't know
you know he's trained by a hypnotist
right
do you all know that
it's not it's not an accident they use
the biggest thing on the internet
he has the actual skills
he's actually been trained
I believe he didn't do that
that
he's he's got Trump level skills
but actually trained by hypnotists
now
if you put Tate
in a court
I just don't think he could get
convicted
because and I hate this I hate to say
this
but his skill level
is so high that I don't think he could
be jailed
I know that's a big claim
but he has the ability to bend reality
so well because he actually has he's
learned specific skills right it's not
it's not like a native ability it's not
just that he's a bully he has actual
skills so his skill stack
for manipulation and persuasion is off
the chart
like he's
he might be exceeding my own abilities
here because he's added he's very
cleverly added the the Macho Alpha thing
so if you had the the alpha the alpha
thing the whole Persona if you add that
to a persuasion stack it really does
double it
right and I don't have that going on
and it would be similar to a beautiful
woman
who also added to her capabilities
persuasion
that would be so far beyond what just
any normal person who knows persuasion
could do so because of his physicality
which is impressive and that that
Persona is created and then the fame and
the you know the the following that he's
created he he has more power than most
court systems
like I I think he could be
hypothetically dead guilty
for a crime and wouldn't have much of a
chance of going to jail at all not at
all
see between the money and the corruption
and even if you assumed he was wrongly
accused
he would still walk free
because his his talent level is at that
level if you don't see it it's because
you're you know you're not trained in
the persuasion
now
so I don't think I don't think he had a
bad night last night necessarily maybe
might surprise me but don't even assume
he had a bad night he may have had a
perfectly good night last night
he may have had more sex last night than
most of you
because if you don't think he could have
had sex inside the police station
on the night that he was supposed to be
in jail if you don't think he could have
gotten a girl in there and had sex with
her in the police station then you
haven't been paying attention he totally
could do that right I don't know and I'm
not saying he did I'm saying that if
you're the most corrupt country and you
have tens of millions of dollars of free
cash and this is only rumored I'm not
making this claim
is rumored you might have some
connection to organize crime in Romania
if you're if you're connected to
organized crime the only way you're
going to stay down is if they want you
to
so it it's possible that he pissed off
somebody
that he works with
right that would be a different
situation that would be dangerous
but if he only but if if it's just the
police pretending to arrest him
I know it's not he's not much trouble
all right so you can have an interesting
conversation about Free Will and whether
or not uh Andrew Tate hypnotized them
brainwash them or they were willing
because you know that part of the story
is that some of the women I don't have
many
had his name taught tattooed on their
crotches
do you believe
that that was against their will
it's impossible to know
it's actually impossible now because the
Tates have enough skill
that they could change somebody's mind
from something that makes sense to
something that's a bad idea and that
person would actually think it was their
idea
until maybe later they changed their
mind
and what is that is that free will
because the person had all the
information
and then they made the decision and they
thought it was their own decision was
that free will
and then later they changed their mind
said oh my God that must have been I
must have been brainwashed why'd I do
that is that free will
there's no way to convict him
see you you'd have to you would have to
prove that the women did and any one of
these behaviors that are part of the
accusations you would have to prove they
weren't willing it can't be done
it can be done with normal people that's
how people get convicted it can't be
done with the teens detains it can't be
done with the Tates
because you would never be able to sort
out what was their actual willing
decision and what was the influence
can't be sorted out
all right
and Coulter uh provocatively tweeted
how could any white man vote for the
Democrats
she pointed out to back her assertion
there that of the 97 judges Biden has
put in the bench only five have been
white men and then she cataly says in in
the
parenze
and I'm reserving judgment on those five
I'm reserving Judgment of those five now
um
some would say quite reasonably this is
a case of racist calling out racists
because the the judge selection seems
racist on his face
and of course when
when Ann Coulter calls it out the way
she does in her provocative way
people who say well you're the racist
we're not the racist you're the racist
we're trying to correct the racism of
the past by having a more balanced bench
so
um I think they're both right
they're both right it's sort of like
racist calling each other racist in in
the narrow sense that they're both
looking at through a racism lens right
so if that's your lens
then you're both racists right it
doesn't mean one of you is bad and one
of you is good it just means you're both
looking through a racial filter and they
both are
so being blind to race
to me would be the opposite of racism
but since they're both highly tuned to
it
I'm not saying one of them is a bad
person I'm saying they're a filter is
race
and I think that's less the question
than the question of her first good
question why why would a white man
ever vote Democrat
what do you think why would a white man
vote Democrat
go
I think it's because
they they pair up with women on birth
control
more likely
than the people on the right
I'm just letting the hang there a little
bit do you think I'm serious
yeah
um I'm now serious because I don't have
any any data to support that but let me
let me finish the thought
um women on birth control
are more likely to pick a beta male
roommate
true or false true or false does science
support that statement
that when women when women are fertile
they pick more men with masculine
features
now there have been studies on that we
we don't trust any scientific studies
anymore because we've learned from the
pandemic that studies are usually
 but this particular study
doesn't seem to have any kind of
pharmaceutical backing right it's just
an interesting study of can people
identify
you know testosterone and men and so
since it doesn't have an obvious
like pharmaceutical bias to it it
probably is an academic study where
people just wanted to know
um is a little more credible
but not necessarily 100 credible now
do you think it would be true
that Democrat women are more likely to
be on birth control
I don't know if that's true is that true
is that true
because uh you know I anecdotally
anecdotally I have no idea
I'm saying yeses and those so this is
the reason that I'm not actually
seriously making this claim but just
follow it through
let's let let's say what if it is true
it's sort of unknown but what if it is
if it is true here's the situation you
should expect
you should expect that Democrats if it
were true and we don't know this if they
were more on birth control the women
would filter out the masculine man
and they would they would prefer
the more
compliant you know simplic beta map
huge over you know over generalization
right so I'm not I'm not insulting any
specific Democrats right everybody's
individual but I'm talking about large
movements now in theory that would
create a situation where Democrats would
be favoring females over males
on lots of big political decisions
because the women would say what's good
for us oh we like that and then they
tell the men what to favor
and then the man who had been selected
for being compliant you know the low
testosterone men those men would say all
right okay if that's good for you it's
good for me
so you should from just a hormonal
perspective
end up with a male party and a female
party over time
over time
because in the on the right and again
this would be a gross generalization you
know every individual is different we're
all smart enough to know that on the
right there may be some filtering toward
more masculine dominant men and women
who prefer being in that kind of
relationship
in which case you'd see that the men
would say what's good for me and I'm
also looking out for you that's that's
part of the deal and the women say all
right if it's good for you and you're
looking down for me and I don't see
anything wrong with it I'm on board
so over time birth control alone
if it favored one political side and
that's the part I don't know but if that
were true you should end up
accidentally with a male party and a
female party
did I blow your mind yet
because I don't know if I don't know if
anything happened but it would explain
it
yeah it would explain what you see
but I can't I can't make the claim that
that's what's happening now it does seem
it does seem that birth control or not
it does seem clear that there's a
filtering toward a certain kind of male
on one side and a different kind of male
on the other side but you would agree
with that much right
so the the trend toward a male party and
the female party is pretty clear
all right
um
yes a must tweeted a escape the matrix
uh the meme this morning
that included on learning everything you
have been taught
so I love the fact that musk is trying
to deprogram civilization
so that's what he's doing he's trying to
move them more toward you know rational
thought and away from the
you know the the craziness now can he do
it well part of it would depend on
whether he's hallucinating or he's the
one who's figured it out
hard to know
uh Cobra Tate retweeted it what did he
retweet
other okay
um the meme I guess
well and bus was on the podcast recently
talking about some of the changes at
Twitter that are quite interesting among
them
the points he made is that Twitter
before must took over Twitter there was
a disincentive to get rid of bots
because Bots were a part of their
profitability and and what they focused
on was a number of daily use users and
botswear would show up as daily users so
if you go to sell advertising
you want to act like you have lots of
users and so they didn't have a real
incentive to get rid of the Bots because
the Bots were making the money
now this is musk's musk's clay
now
and then musk fairly quickly reduced the
number of bots substantially because he
said it was never hard
it was never hard to make them go away
they just didn't have a reason because
they were making money from them
now remember I told you that watching
Musk
work on Twitter would be like an MBA
like you're getting a whole Business
Degree here
perfect example
musk understands that you have to focus
on the customer experience first
and I would argue that's why Tesla
succeeded
because he didn't focus on profitability
he focused on making something that
would turn on a consumer and he's never
left that Focus it's like do you like it
you know does a consumer like this and
then with Twitter the same thing you
know he's interacting with the people
and you know getting finding what they
want and failing quickly but this focus
on the customer instead of the profits
is how you become more more profitable
so if you skip the step of making the
customer happy and Skip straight to more
profitability
such as allowing Bots to stay on your
your service you lose in the long run
now that's that's an actual class
in an MBA class like this this is
exactly
precisely what you would learn if you
took an advanced class in business you
would learn to do what he just taught
you
to make sure you didn't get lost on the
short-term profitability
uh um and then he talks about failing
fast and and uh correcting and that
again is a b testing that's straight out
of the the best practices for you know
startups or anything that's operating
with urgency
all right
I'm going to Prime you
and then take you into some difficult
psychological territory
who's up for a ride
you ready for a ride on the Wild Side
now I'm going to Prime you but I'm
telling you I'm priming you right so
this is all up front fully fully
transparent
the first story is a primer and it's
unrelated to where I'm I'm going to go
except it primes you okay
back when I was uh
I was working in the Pacific Bell
some of you have heard this story I was
asked to work on a special project to
build a technology laboratory within our
headquarters you know to convert some
space into a really big laboratory and
the budget at one point was up to 10
million dollars or at least the
estimated cost so somewhere between
three and ten million dollars depending
on how wet big it needs to be and I was
put in charge
so this is you know pretty important
project really it was kind of the most
important thing that was happening in
the whole the whole area but I had you
know Financial background and so I was
sort of the right one to figure out if
it were if it could pay for itself and
if it made sense
so the starting premise was that
customers were begging for this ability
because they couldn't buy our products
you know they wanted to but they
couldn't buy them unless they tested
them with their networks and equipment
and they didn't have any way to do it so
they said you need a lab so we can come
in and connect and see if it all works
so I'd heard that the customers were
begging for this and so to to do my
analysis I went to the various people
who who know the customers are asking
for it and I said hey
is it true that the customers are asking
for this Laboratory and the first
manager I asked oh oh God yes yes very
important customers are asking for it I
keep getting all kinds of requests
I'm like oh okay so I went to another
manager same story oh yeah the customers
are like they're they're begging us for
it and so many of them lots of customers
and then I kept asking and kept asking
but I kept asking them if they could
turn me on to an actual customer
like did does it do you know which ones
asked because I wanted to actually ask
the actual customer right because that
might be different than having it
filtered through somebody
so finally
I found out you know the name of an
actual customer
there was one of them
the entire thing started from One
customer one time
asking if we had a laboratory to test
some equipment
when we said no
they rapidly found another way to
satisfy themselves and never had a
problem about it again
here's what happened
the first person who was asked if we had
a laboratory
went to let's say their boss
and said no we don't have that
so that was one person who was aware of
one other person right so now both of
them are aware the only one person had
ever asked
so now the boss having been asked the
question and knowing it was kind of a
good question
has given an answer
but also wants to check on the answer
so it talks to one of the other managers
and says hey you know customers are
asking if we can test things in lab did
you know what do you think about that
and the other the other says we don't
have a lab good
that's that's a good idea I'm going to
talk to some people and see how we can
do this
pretty soon
everybody in management in the
technology area was talking to everybody
else to see what they thought about
building a lab because there was so much
demand that everybody was being asked
eventually to convince themselves
through a self-generated mass hysteria
that it was the most important thing we
needed to do and that everybody was
asking about it
it was never
more than that one customer
one time
who solved their problem without any
help
[Laughter]
so did we build the lab
what do you think well once I had
determined for sure that there was Zero
demand did we go ahead and and green
light the lab
damn right we did
damn right we did because we were all
committed at that point now I was
telling management clearly there is zero
demand
and they said
it's also our biggest project and we've
told management we're going to build
this thing and you sure would look good
on my resume and we'd all like it and it
sure would be nice to work there and it
would certainly looked like progress
so it was close to being green lit and
then there was a reorganization and the
new manager came in and said
this wasn't my idea
and that was all it took to kill it
it wasn't it wasn't the new guy's idea
so the last thing you want to do is take
over
and then have the new guy be responsible
for somebody else's great idea
because if the great idea works it's the
guy who thought of it you know they get
the credit if it doesn't work you're the
one who ruined it so the first thing you
do when you take over is kill all the
last guy's babies so you don't have to
raise them
like you want your own babies
because then if they succeed it's all
you right so that's how the real world
works
in the real world
you can come to believe that one person
saying something once was a lot of
people talking and it was the most
important thing
right that's your primer
right just keep that pattern in mind
see what happens
here's another pattern to keep in your
mind
suppose somebody came up to you
and uh
they said they believed the fine people
hoax they actually believed that Trump
was talking about the neo-nazis when he
called some people at the event find
people
and then they said on top of that they
said they also believed that Trump said
drinking bleach might help with covet
now suppose they believe both of those
debunked hoaxes
what would you think of the third thing
they said no matter what it was on any
let's say a political topic how much how
much credibility would you give them on
the third thing if you heard them
believe two debunk things
you you zero right and that would be the
correct that would be the correct answer
their credibility has been proven now
hypothetically
suppose something like that had happened
to you and you didn't know it because
the people who believe those two hoaxes
they don't know it they think those are
real and is it because they're stupid
is that why they believe hoaxes do
people believe hoaxes because they have
low IQs
nope nope there's no correlation you
could be the smartest or the dumbest
people believe stuff that isn't true
smart people dumb people all kinds of
people so if well-informed and smart
people can have cognitive dissonance and
believe hoax how could you know it
that's never happened to you
how can you know
well you couldn't right
because the Because by definition the
person who's suffering is the only one
who doesn't know
everybody else can tell
but if if you're suffering you don't
know
so would you agree hypothetically
I'm not saying that it's happening to
you but I'm saying hypothetically
if it did happen to you you would be the
only one who couldn't tell right that's
just the definition of what cognitive
dissonance is it's the thing that the
person who has it can't tell
right
so
let's talk about
the world economic forum and Klaus
Schwab and Bill Gates and the U.N
and other entities that you believe want
to depopulate the Earth
how many of you here believe that
important uh powerful entities
want to reduce the population of Earth
from its currently around eight to eight
billion ish
how many of you believe there's people
in power
this is a key phrase
people in power
how many people how many think people in
power
what are eight billion people to be
reduced
a lot of people believe that yeah I'm
seeing a lot of confirmation here all
right let me tell you why you believe
that
and it's just like the Pacific Bell
Laboratory
here's the pattern you're gonna you're
gonna see
now if you're in deep cognitive
dissonance you're going to change the
subject
and you're going to say but but
something related to this no if you stay
on the subject I might be able to walk
you out
so that you're not the one who believes
the fine people hoax and the and the
drinking bleed chokes if you believe the
depopulation hoax
you will not have credibility on the
next thing you say
so what I'm trying to do
is fix
The credibility of people I largely
agree with and want to be associated
with
so your people I largely agree with and
want to be associated with so I would
like you to make sure
that you're not lowering your own
credibility
because that's good for all of us we
would all benefit if we're all a little
bit more credible okay
here's how
the belief that there are powerful
people who want to depopulate
came into being let's see I haven't
decided which side I'm going to show you
first
uh
oh
here's the reality as far as I can tell
and by the way part of this story is
Elon Musk fact checked me this morning
how many of you saw that yeah it's so
freaky so
um I I will talk about this next but
Elon Musk
um has I'm not sure it's a disagreement
but let's say he added a lot to the
conversation right so we'll get to that
I know you don't always get that
so here's what here's what I believe is
truth and I will convince you that this
is truth that there are definitely
people who want to manage the population
growth of the planet
manage
not not the grace
not increase
match now manage means this
in some cases you might want it to go up
let's say Italy and Japan and the United
States in some cases you might want to
slow it down
that might be let's say a super poor
African nation
so that would be managing it's neither
up nor down it's finding the right
amount for each individual area of the
year of the Earth
okay now I believe that everybody who
has power
is on the same page
that every single smart person with
power
I see I put myself on the list
persuasion that I make a list with all
the smartest people I can think of and I
just throw myself on the list I hope he
caught that even the fact that I pointed
it out and told you is persuasion still
works
it still works that that's persuasion
Association is an irrational process so
even though I said hey look at my trick
I put my own name on a name of a list of
super successful smart people
still works still works
anyway so my belief is that the UN the
WF Gates Etc have never
have never been on any page except
wisely managing it now you're going to
say to me Scott there is a mountain of
information a mountain massive
information
that that at least several of these
people want to depopulate I could show
you the video I could show you the
direct quote right
how many how many would would say that
right now Scott there's massive
information that they want to do that
I've seen it with how many would say
I've seen it with my own eyes
and I've heard it with my own ears
where else have you heard that
who who else says I saw it with my own
eyes and I heard it with my own ears and
yet it didn't happen
that's everyone who believes
the fine people hoax their defense is
always the same their defenses I saw it
myself
I heard it myself
the uh the drinking bleach Oaks same
defense I heard it myself I saw it
myself
that's the same evidence people have
that the powerful people want to
depopulate the earth I saw it myself I
heard it myself
as has no evidentiary value
because if you're in cognitive
dissonance you believe you saw it and
you believe you heard it but it's
unrelated to what happened
right if you believe that you heard any
of these people say they want the planet
of the population to go from its current
8 billion
to a number less than that that never
happened anywhere
it never happened anywhere
now
I got fact checked by Elon Musk who
pointed to a New York Times article
that um
that Elon
um
he represented as a common view now you
could argue what common is right that's
a little subjective but there was a a
gentleman uh named
give it his actual name
somebody Knight
you probably know it
uh so there's a guy named Paul erlich
and there's another guy somebody Knight
who wants to depopulate the world
what the hell is his name oh last night
the founder of the quote voluntary
Extinction movement so the New York
Times
talked about this guy who literally
wants to decrease the population
so first clarification
do you believe
that I believe
that out of the eight billion people
there's not a single person on Earth
who wants the population to decrease
from 8 billion to something less would
you believe that I don't think anybody
believes that like there's nobody in
their bedroom somewhere to believe it no
of course not you should never interpret
anything as an absolute if you hear me
make a statement unless I say it's an
absolute
never it's never an absolute it's just
sort of general you know General Trends
and stuff
so do I believe that there are crazy
environmentalists who do in fact want to
get rid of people
of course I do
of course I do
I'm literally famous for saying that
there's always going to be somebody 25
of the public will always get the wrong
answer to every question
is there anything I've said more often
than that that 25 of the public gets
every question wrong this is one of
those
do I think that there is a common view
that there are too many people well
maybe not 25 in this case but yeah I
mean if you said it's 10 or 20 I'd say
maybe
but here's the part you're missing
do you remember when
the left went crazy that a bunch of
unarmed or at least they didn't show
their weapons uh at least guns uh that a
bunch of
people without firearms
tried a an Insurrection against the
United States and you said what the hell
is going on here there's no such thing
as unarmed people trying to take over
take over the government that's not a
thing but the left believed it
or acted like it and it's because there
are a few people
there were a few people on January 6 who
were the worst people
and so if you concentrate into those few
people and imagine that's like that
somehow they have power
then suddenly you you've imagined a few
crazy people have have more power than
they do
a few crazy people don't conquer a
country
they don't do an insurrection
and those few crazy people had no
influence on the the bulk of the people
because the bulk of the people were just
trespassing without even knowing they
were in many cases they didn't even know
they were breaking the law right
ah
so here's my point if you're worried
that anybody who has power
wants to depopulate the Earth there's no
evidence of that the evidence is that
100 of the people with power want to
manage population maybe slow it in a
poor country
maybe increase it where the population
decreases the problem
and then and then here's the pushback I
got but Scott you're missing all of the
hints
the hints
the hints are these
they say stuff like population growth is
a huge problem
so therefore they don't want they want
fewer people to which I say that's not
the same thing
population growth is a huge problem
everybody agrees but it's a problem we
manage
all right let me give you some other
examples of where people thought they
saw evidence but they imagined it
um
let's see
they gave us some exact quotes here
so there is a leftist professor this
Paul Ehrlich guy who does want a fewer
people
how much influence does that guy have
never heard anybody in power
who wanted fewer people so I would say
he has as much power as the few
extremists on January 6.
a little bit
nothing to worry about
right a little bit hardly anything
all right so I wouldn't worry about the
the weirdo environmentalists who want
fewer people because nobody's paying
attention to them
and nobody with power but certainly
citizens believe it all right as other
people say but what about Jane Goodall
had this quote about too many people to
which I say that's Jane Goodall
if she's talking about apes people might
pay attention if she's talking about
human population growth she has no power
and it was years ago I don't even know
if she would say the same thing today do
you think Jane Goodall would say that
Italy doesn't need more people
now she would do the same thing
everybody else did she'd find out oh
their their population is decreasing
they probably need more people
how about uh prince Andrew had some kind
of forward or something in a book in
which he did say that you know
population was too much
it was a it was a 1986 book
and then somebody else said but we were
all we were all trained as kids
that there are too many people
yes we were I was back forever ago
because population growth looked like a
real problem and now it looks like it's
a problem in some places and not others
so so are our views modified so anything
that happened 50 years ago isn't
relevant
that's not happening today anything that
a few weirdos think would be better for
the world apparently is having no effect
on any decision makers
but what about somebody like um
Paul Krugman
um
somebody produced a quote and of course
this is so out of context that I hate to
even criticize it because when you take
it out of context it's so not fair
because I don't even know if Krugman was
talking about this but
let me ask you if you knew that Krugman
was the only person on one side of an
issue
you know he's famous for being wrong
right
that's literally what he's most famous
for
he's the most famous wrong Economist of
all famous Congress
now I'm sure he's gotten some things
right
but he's actually famous for being the
most wrong
so if he's all you got
that's a problem but let's see what he
said
now remember he's an economist and
economists tend to talk in confusing
weasel word way see if you could even
understand this
you're going to think you do the first
time I read it but then I'm going to go
back back through it
see if you really do understand it
quote and at first I don't even know if
this is a real quote but let's say it is
is stagnant or declining population a
big economic problem
whoa
we'll get back to that so is stagnant or
declining population a big economic
problem remember he's a famous Nobel
winning economist
he says it doesn't have to be okay
that sounds pretty clear right
he's saying declining population doesn't
have to be a problem
uh
and he says in fact in a world of
limited resources and major
environmental problems there's something
to be said for a reduction in population
pressure okay there it is he's saying
directly he wants fewer people in the
world right
right
is that what you heard
yes or no
I'll read it again and then say yes or
no does he want fewer people in the
world is stagnant or declining
population a big economic problem it
doesn't have to be in fact in a world of
limited resources and major
environmental problems there's something
to be said for reduction in population
pressure
no but the person who said it to me
thought I did say that
why why did they think you said it when
you can so clearly say he's see that
he's not he's not saying it
it's confirmation bias once you believe
just like the laboratory Thing Once you
believe that all the customers are
asking for it and that's your belief
then you just see it everywhere
everywhere you hear yeah there's another
one there's no that's what that's
confirmation bias
so all of these examples that people
send to me
they're absurd or ridiculous or the
opposite of their point
but if you ask them
have I debunked all of their examples
what would they say
what would somebody say if they'd shown
me let's say six examples and they're
all easily debunked if I do it right in
front of them that what would there be
response be oh I changed my mind you
debunked all my examples
no people don't act that way they would
say my God Scott you must be working for
the world economic Forum Klaus Schwab is
I believe obviously got to you you must
be one of the elites you're ignoring the
mountain of evidence and then I would
say
there were six examples that were your
best examples and I just debunked them
in 30 seconds
what mountain of evidence and then the
person in confirmation bias would say
the mountain of evidence I just showed
you
right that's what they say they say I
just showed you the mountain of evidence
and then I would say I just debunked all
of it like easily
so that so that's was somebody
experiencing a psychological phenomenon
that's how they would act
all right so then somebody said to me
what's it like being fact-checked by
Elon Musk
that didn't happen
that literally is imaginary
Elon Musk did in fact check me
because I don't disagree
that there are weird environmentalists
who do in fact want fewer people
like I I was aware that that ex that
group existed so even when I was you
know making my more extreme claims that
nobody believes it
I really of course thought there were
crazy people who believed it but nothing
to worry about
nothing the crazy people are saying
is bleeding into reasonable people who
have power
now here's the part that's really going
to make you
crazy
Klaus Schwab do you know his uh academic
credentials are his background
do you know what it is like job and
academics are
he's both an engineer and an economist
how many of you knew that he's an
engineer
and an economist
do you know how often uh
but but here's what he's not
he's not an expert at communication
you see the problem
he's not an expert at communication
has he communicated well
apparently not because there are a lot
of people who believe that he thinks
differently than he thinks do you
believe that there's any Economist who's
also an engineer
who in 2022
believes that the population should go
from 8 billion to less than that go do
you believe there's any Economist who is
also an engineer
who's also an engineer do you believe is
any of them who believe the population
no
that that's where I'll take my stand yes
Elon Musk I agree with you there there
are it's common I'll even use your word
I do think it's common
that crazy people think there should be
less humans or fewer humans
I'll give you that no disagreement at
all but shall be somebody who who
actually is in charge who believes it
nobody
who's also a globalist okay you can even
throw in the globalist
so if you read the UN website you read
the WF and you read the actual context
in every case they're talking about
managing population as one of the big
variables about civilization you know
energy is one climate is one population
is one you know it's just one of the
variables so of course they mention it
and of course they take it seriously and
of course it has to be managed
and you all agree with that
um
all of your historical examples
are either wrong
or I stipulate that they're correct but
they're not on topic we're only talking
about now
I will also agree there may have been
maybe even important people in the past
who thought that a population should be
reduced
but today there's nobody with any power
nobody in charge who thinks that in
general we should have fewer people on
earth
now
do you think that anybody who
understands
um and by by the way I say it as an
extreme so that you'll be
incentivized to prove me wrong
which would be interesting
yeah
the the melthusi all right all right I
know you want to talk about the the past
but I don't
what do you think would happen to
National Defense of a country with a
declining population
do you think a country with a declining
population
could uh defend itself in the long run
because you realize that the reason
China is a threat
is mostly because of the number of
people
because because if you have that many
people a little bit of economic benefit
generates so much cash that they can buy
more bombs than anybody can
so they don't even have to be you know
per person the best they can just be
growing and have the most people and
that gives their government the most
money
to buy the most bombs so there's nobody
in power who wants their country to be
more defenseless
would you agree
there's nobody who understands you know
geopolitical power who would want fewer
soldiers or fewer taxpayers nobody
that's not a thing the only people who
would even think that way are people who
have no power and will never have power
because that's crazy talk
that's just crazy talk
all right
um
I think I had another side I was going
to show you today
so when the UN or the world economic
Forum says they want to manage
population growth
they're saying obvious
smart
unescapable things
there's nothing to debate
they're literally saying that some
countries need more people some people
some groups might need to flatten their
growth rate because they don't have
enough you know economic activity to
support it and that these are but the
population is just part of a lot of
variables that include everything from
Health Care to economics
and you have to manage them all is
basically a bunch of bureaucrat talk
that you know we've we put in our minds
to be more than that
so
is there anybody here
who used to believe that the world
economic Forum wants to decrease your
population who now believes that was
never the case
has anybody changed their mind
looks like about I mean it's hard to
judge
maybe half
now for those of you who didn't change
your mind
which might be the
um majority what what is your opinion of
the people who just did change their
mind
do you think that they're all dumb
the ones who just changed their mind do
you think they're all dumb
or do you think uh
well like how do you explain it how do
you explain the people who changed their
mind because you just watched the same
thing they did
that they're saying that you're in the
25 everybody thinks the other people are
in the 25 percent
your arguments are shallow
carbon doctor says
uh your claim of the WF is a straw man
uh
uh well not intentionally not
intentionally but let's take that
seriously so a comment is that my wef
comments are a straw man which I think
indicates that I mischaracterized their
opinion
or somebody's belief of their opinion
did I
because I think there are multiple
opinions so so I'm not if I characterize
one opinion it necessarily
left out some others
[Music]
well if somebody thinks that uh the WF
wanted to reduce the population of Earth
that's a pretty clean binary yes no
claim
and I think I think it made my case
all right
so so here's uh here's your common
here's your tell for cognitive distance
it'll always look like this right and I
don't mean to call you out
but dances with aardvarks says the
actual evidence is easy enough to find
and is not debunkable right that comment
is always cognitive distance
now I know you don't believe it
you have to see enough examples it's
always cognitive systems because this is
identical to what the fine people hoax
people say it's identical to what the
the people who believe the bleach
drinking Coke say it's identical and you
don't get identical responses unless
there's like a similar psychological
thing going on
uh it's just a weak case it's too
shallow I don't even know which side you
mean a shallow
uh Robert says so here's here's another
cognitive dissonance Robert Wood says
well Scott lately your stream's all
about trying to pump up your massive ego
now
I'm pretty sure my massive ego has been
somewhat uh somewhat similar the whole
time
if you believe that I was not displaying
a massive ego before
I would question your assumption so I
believe that you are hallucinating an
increase in that behavior and the reason
you're hallucinating it is that that's
your that's your escape hatch
your escape hatch is to imagine
something is wrong with me because
there's nothing wrong with the the
argument
that's what cognitive dissonance looks
like so cognitive distance is almost
always a personal attack
a claim that there's a mountain of
evidence that you're blind to even if
you just talked about it
uh so it's changing changing the subject
and acting like it's the same thing
uh and the personal attacks those those
are just clear signals
uh
now do the berggron Institute I don't
know who they are
yeah we talked about Tate
and so Kyle I'll come I'll show you all
the cognitive distance so you've all
watched me say over and over again I'm
not counting uh historical examples
because in the past people did some of
them want fewer people so Kyle Wood says
Scott Hitler thought the world was
overpopulated
now that's cognitive distance
because I so clearly said I'm only only
talking about now
anything you say about the past I don't
care or I agree with
and then somebody will say but what
about the past
so that that's cognitive distance
you literally can't hear something right
in front of you
um
[Music]
what benefit is the quote great
replacement do you believe in the great
replacement too
historical examples is your escape hatch
that's cognitive distance that's
projection
what's the WF Wes purpose
change of topic
cognitive distance
please show us where the WF says they
want more people on the planet
cognitive dissonance change of subject
um
all right but you can see so this
this stream was not meant to make you
feel warm and fuzzy or at least that
part of it
I'm trying to trying to cultivate an
audience
who can debunk things more readily than
other people
and
sometimes it means your own beliefs are
going to get debunked
and and the the thought that there's
anybody in power who wants fewer people
in the world
is ridiculous and you need you need to
get past that in order to seem credible
on other topics and I think that this is
useful
well let me ask the question
is it even useful for me to try to do
this
like I get that it didn't succeed with
all of you but was it useful to try
the locals people are more likely to say
yes
but we have some sprinklings of no in
there and that
oh actually I'm getting I'm getting a
better response to this than I expected
good you know the critics sometimes are
a little too loud
so they're they're they're screaming
about any topic that makes their head
hurt
so I feel like maybe I was missing that
some of you were appreciating the the
debunkings
all right
um I feel like there was at least one
other topic that I I'm forgetting but
this is slow news week
so
uh
yeah usually somebody calls me a grifter
by now
iron sharpens iron out there that's the
attitude
uh so chaos Corner says so here here's
your classic example there was no
debunking done today
now you could tell that that's cognitive
dissonance right
because the people who have the people
who have specific
you know objections they say them
every time
because if you have like a specific like
game-winning objection you're not gonna
you're not gonna leave it on the table
you're going to play it because that's
your your winning card nobody leaves the
winning card on the table to go insult
you and run away
first they play the winning card
and then they insult you and go away so
if they insult you first and tell you
that they've got the winning card but
they're just too busy to show you
you can discount those people
uh Rogue stranger says Scott thinks if
he says no it's a debunk
you see what that is right
all right
your card what
and now people are arguing about my
analogy which is another good sign of
cognitive dissonance
can you name some of your own beliefs
you debunked
how does one debunk their own beliefs
are you asking me something I've ever
changed my mind on
is that the question is there is there
actually somebody on locals
who thinks they haven't seen me change
my mind
is that even possible
I I might literally be the most
mind-changing public figure of all time
I don't think anybody's ever done it
more than I have
all right
and somebody's still asking me if yeah
asking questions about Hitler everybody
who mentioned Hitler in this
conversation
you might be experiencing cognitive
dissonance
all right
have you caught yourself in cognitive
distance yes
but you don't catch yourself while
you're in it you catch yourself when you
accidentally get you know flipped out of
it and then you look back you're like
what
what
there's a hole in your theory cognitive
dissonance
if we're a simulation uh that's a longer
conversation
what can we do to flip your distance
evidence
here here's what it would take to flip
my distance
one clear statement from a member of
let's say a managing member of the wef
that says that 8 billion is too many
people
that would do it
anything anything that suggests to that
would do it
but that doesn't exist
the Georgia Guidestones what
all right
you think people in power are benevolent
cognitive dissonance nobody thinks that
I hate on Kerry Lake
but what's Katie Hobbs fentanyl plan
you're hallucinating
uh he hates to be on the side of the
majority you're hallucinating
did Scott talk about
I thought Christina's baby daddy getting
arrested that of course is a rumor that
that Tate himself started because he's
not a good person
uh
what are the top three cognitive biases
I see today I don't know I'd have to
think about that
um
that's weird
there's somebody who's obsessing about
my opinions about Katie Hobbs could
there be anything less important today
I'll hide you because you're having some
kind of episode
Alex Katz I don't know
the problem is Scott refuses to read any
articles anyone sends him debunking his
arguments do you think that's true
or does that sound like uh because
couldn't know that
you think that's true no that's
obviously not true let me tell you what
I don't look at if somebody says I have
an article
that proves that let's say there proves
that Superman is real
and then I don't look at it
and people say if you would look at my
argument that Superman is real
you know maybe I could take you more
seriously now I'm not going to look at
your argument that Superman's real but
I'll ask you to do this
type type into a Google search what you
think is real
and then the word debunk
because I did
because I did and I read a lot of
articles about your point of view
and I've seen both sides but I bet you
can't describe the other side
I'll bet you can't so for those people
who said you know you sent me something
I didn't read there's a reason I didn't
read it there are some things that are
so obviously on the surface you
don't need to read it
do you know what I didn't read is Paul
Eric's uh reason why he wants fewer
people
I also didn't read all of Elon musk's
article he sent me about that one crazy
guy who wants fewer humans
there's nothing to read there
let me teach you something I learned in
graduate school
now this will sound really cocky
I guess there's no way to fix that so
I'm just going to sound really arrogant
now okay and but the arrogance is based
on the fact that
um
sometimes you have a difference in
agreement but other times you have a
difference in training
I think I'm not going to finish that
thought
there's a hole in your argument
it's technically possible to deep
populate via
blah blah blah various mechanisms
no that's not a hole in my argument
that's not related to my argument
so there's somebody saying there's a
hole in my argument that I'll see if I
can paraphrase this right that there are
a bunch of mechanisms from monetary
policy and technology that would have
the effect
it would have the effect of depopulating
right
so that has nothing to do with my point
those are the things that you need to
change so if the effect of those things
is to give you a smaller population in
Italy that you need to fix it if the
effect of those things is to give you a
slower growth in a poor country that
needs some slower growth then you don't
fix it but you're just talking about the
tools
we have tools did I disagree with that
is there a hole in my argument that I
agree with you that tools exist and that
things can affect other things that's
not a whole that's obvious
um
depopulation is a foregone conclusion
depends on the country
hard to prove intent
ban who
all right I think we've uh exhausted
this topic
um
I'm trying to decide if I should be uh
live stream on New Year's Eve tomorrow
they want to they want to distribute
wealth so there is them enslaves that's
everybody
uh everybody wants to be in charge and
enslave everybody else they just don't
admit it
where to get hypnosis training I have no
idea
I mean other than finding a hypnotist to
train you and even then to be better
with a group of people so use Google and
I have no better I have no better advice
than that
all right I think we're done on YouTube
