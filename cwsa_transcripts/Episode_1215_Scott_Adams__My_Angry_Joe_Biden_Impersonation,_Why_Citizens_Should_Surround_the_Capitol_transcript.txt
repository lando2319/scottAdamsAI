sing along with me
you know the words
all right everybody come on in come on
and gather out
it's time for coffee with scott adams
the best time of the day
how many times have i told you that and
been right
every time every single time this will
be no exception
there might be a little extra cursing
because later i'll be talking about
congress
and if you can talk about congress
without cursing
well you're a better person than i am
let me tell you
but if you would like to enjoy the
simultaneous cursing today
after the sip all you need is a copper
mugger glass attacker chelsea stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that's
already making you feel better can you
feel it you can
right it's building starting to build up
you started out feeling pretty good but
already it's a little bit better isn't
it isn't it
isn't it savor it
when i'm right i'm right number one
i am giving you an assignment
i don't always give homework but today
it's a special occasion
you all have to watch the humorous video
by ryan long
that i have pinned to my twitter feed so
i pinned it at the top
so you have no excuse you can't say the
dog lost your homework
you have to watch this video and the
only reason you have to watch it is
cursing alert everybody send the
children back to bed
cursing alert is on the reason you have
to watch this video
it's the funniest thing you've
seen in 2020
and maybe longer you know
i thought humor was dead i've been
saying that for a while in terms of
you know sort of scripted intentional
humor as opposed to the news
well this is scripted and intentional
and it's freaking brilliant
and you have to watch it that's your
homework
don't go to the end of the day until
you've watched that video
and then you can thank me later because
you're going to enjoy it
all right the simulation continues to
wink at us
would you like another example of the
simulation
once you start seeing it you're going to
see it everywhere which either means
we do live in the simulation or
confirmation
bias exists it's one of those two things
but let me give you another example in
case you hadn't uh thought of it
and this comes from twitter user
dia dia and she notes that joe biden has
an interesting name for our
time what is the thing people say about
joe biden the most
probably if you were going to pick one
thing that people
talk about joe biden the most it would
be that they think he's a short timer
the the number one thing you think about
biden is
he's not going to be in the job long
would you agree
now some people might say it's one term
democrats and republicans might say well
you know it might be shorter than one
term if you know what i mean
but what are the odds that a person who
you think
is going to be here briefly that that's
his main characteristic
is that he would be here briefly
and his actual real name is
joe by done
what are the odds really joe
bye done
if that's not the simulation winking at
you
i don't know what it is confirmation
bias maybe
that's the other possibility let me give
you another uh
clue for living in a simulation
if we live in the simulation you'd have
to ask yourself
why who built the simulation what would
be the point of the
simulation and i don't know the answer
to that
but let's reason through it for a moment
if we were a simulation i would
speculate
that one of the most logical reasons you
would do it there could be a variety of
reasons you would do it
but the most common and logical reason
to do it
would be to place yourself into the game
and play it like a video game in which
you're trying to achieve
goals and go to higher levels
now this is going to freak you out a
little bit
some of you anyway some of you will get
freaked out a little bit when i say this
because you're going to start to see it
in your environment it'll be like i
opened a little window and it could be
confirmation bias
but when you start seeing it it's going
to be a fun freaky feeling so that's the
reason i'm doing it
and goes like this have you noticed
that the people who are real people as
opposed to the npcs
you know there must be some npcs out
there people who are not real
real people they're just programmed
the real people seem to have problems
that
fit consistent themes here's what i mean
i can't give you too much detail about
my personal life you wouldn't want to
know anyway
but suffice to say that i i find that
all of my problems in life
fit these few themes in other words
i might have a problem that you've never
had in your entire life
it'll be a very unique kind of a problem
that if i told you about it you'd say
geez i've never even heard of that
that's like a problem that literally i
don't know one person in the world
who has a problem even in that sort of
general category
but i will have a problem like that one
after another after another after
another and each of the cases will be
different
but they're the same theme
watch when you see that in your own life
that
your problems follow a theme they're
different
but one follows another just like a game
like you're done with this one
the next one pops up right on time and
it's that same theme
watch how often that happens in your
life all right let's talk about the news
there's a big texas lawsuit
uh will it be the kraken well
it is the kraken in one sense it does
seem to have
a lot of you know allegations in it
has lots of evidence and i believe
that's the case in which they have a
statistician who calculated
the odds of it being a free and fair
election in terms of no fraud
at one in a quadrillion
so it's a it's a very large document
the the texas lawsuit very large
and it has tons and tons of specific
uh allegations that this many
dead people voted i think this is one
right that has lots of detail
of what the claims are lots of different
claims
now how does cnn
describe a lawsuit that's just is just
brimming
with claims and evidence now remember
evidence is not proof
because evidence could be turned out not
to be good evidence but it's still
evidence
even if it turns out later to be
debunked so how does
cnn describe a gigantic
you know trove of evidence
they said it this way
they said quote
it's a brief without evidence
cnn referred to it as a brief
that is without evidence now are they
using
evidence in a different way than you and
i use it
because i would think that if a
statistician looked at the actual data
and concluded there was a one in one
quadrillion
chance that it was a a good election
i would feel that that's evidence right
do we now have court cases in which
experts testify
on the statistical likelihood of a thing
happening
that's evidence right
i would think that would be strong
evidence you know what would be
weak evidence there's a one in three
chance that there was a crime
that would be weak evidence one in
ten chance there was a crime
you know or one in 10 chance there
wasn't a crime i guess you should be
saying it that way
but it's one in a quadrillion i would
say that a
one in one quadrillion chance
that something wasn't a crime would be
you know certainly accompanied with the
trove
of allegations that would be the
opposite of no evidence
but that's cnn for you there you go
so all the smart people say the texas
lawsuit will fail
and i agree with that do you know why
the texas
lawsuit is likely to fail it's the
doctrine of latches
oh let me explain to you the doctrine of
latches
now that's just one of the reasons the
other reason is that the supreme court
doesn't like to mess with the state's
business
that's me as a non-lawyer explaining
lawyerly things
all right so we're we're a system in
which the federal
part of the government doesn't like to
interfere with the states
unless it's some absolute requirement so
that's probably the biggest reason that
it'll get thrown out
is just that it's the system doesn't
want
that to happen meaning the supreme court
will say yeah i see your point
i see that you've got this case
but it doesn't matter and it doesn't
matter for two reasons
one is that we don't want to get into
the state's business there are lots of
you know details of what that means
different ways you can say that but it
all means the same thing don't want to
get into the state's business
and then the second thing is that the
doctrine of
latches a legal standard says that
what are you going to do because you're
asking for too much
to reverse it because what they're
saying is well you waited so long to
make this case and by the way
we don't want to reverse something
that's like such a gigantic thing
for what might be lesser crimes
so you don't want to make the the fix
worse than the crime and the supreme
court
might say and likely will say
whether they say it out loud they're
going to likely say that changing this
result
even if it was completely justified
it would be worse than not changing it
now i didn't know about this legal
standard
by which you would say you know it's
sort of too late and you
it's too late to fix it so we're going
to let it go
and if i'm ever accused of murdering
somebody and let's say i've actually
done it
the defense i'm going to use will be
something like this
if you kill me and execute me for
murdering that person
that person isn't going to come back to
life
but the result will be two people dead
instead of one
because you'll execute me for being a
murderer
i'm gonna argue doctrine of latches
and i'm gonna say it's a little too late
now
because if you haven't noticed my victim
is already dead if you had tried to stop
me prior to murdering
i could see why that would be maybe a
productive thing to do
but he's already dead how the hell are
you going to fix that
so i think you should just say it's kind
of too late
doctrine of latches too late can't
come back to life
and if you kill me you're just going to
make one
extra person unhappy and then the state
is going to have to pay for me
and there's going to be appeals it gets
expensive
how in the world doesn't that make the
world a worse place
now you might argue that you have to
have some kind of penalty for crimes
because if you don't have penalty for
crimes doesn't that seem like it would
encourage those crimes to happen again
but no the supreme court i believe will
rule
or believe and at least part of its uh
some part of its decision is going to
rule that yeah
yeah if you did reverse the election
that would go a long way toward maybe
maybe limiting this kind of crime or
alleged crime
in the future but they may decide that
it's just not worth it because it would
make things worse
so there you go um
but i ask you this let's compare the
murder example
in which you literally can't bring a
person back to life
to the election example in which
reversing the election would be
trivial trivial
reversing the whole election would be
absolutely trivial
it would be one document that says yeah
we're gonna we agree
we'll throw out the results in those
states
and then the inauguration would be trump
in uh instead of biden it's actually
kind of easy
nobody's dead there's actually nothing
that can't be reversed
somewhat easily one piece of paper
justice's sign and say yeah those state
results don't count we're throwing them
out
that's it and then then the government
actually
doesn't even change i would say the most
disruptive change would be a new
government
and i would say that if the supreme
court decides that this is an
unpunishable problem because it's too
late
they're guaranteeing it happens again
so i this will i think we're gearing up
for
a gigantic mistake by the supreme court
which they would make in the uh probably
in the interest of uh
keeping things stable it's my guess i
think that's where it's gonna go
i've told you about the uh gel man
amnesia uh
idea it's the idea this physicist named
gil mann or gel man or something
he noted that when he was looking at
something in the news on his expertise
physics he could tell that the story was
pretty much always wrong
because it was his expertise and he
could say oh that's wrong
but when he read stories which were not
in his expertise he would read them
uncritically like that's probably right
but what are the odds that the only news
that's wrong
happens to be in your expertise so
we're seeing another example of this in
the news today
and it's a funny one so mike
schellenberger
is calling out the new york times for
running apparently a
front-page story claiming that
uh the recent fires in california killed
quote countless ancient redwoods
so it's a new york times is the paper of
record in other words
the most credible news organization
on their front page is running this you
know environmental kind of story about
all the
about the redwoods being destroyed in
the fires
except one little problem
there's this guy named mike
schellenberger who used to be
an activist and knows a lot about
redwood forest
turns out it was one of his areas of
interest
so he like the physicist gail mann
reads this article in a different way
than you and i do because he reads
as someone who really knows his field
and it turns out that instead of
this being true what the new york times
says countless ancient redwoods
being destroyed in fires
at the end of his tweet thread mike
schellenberger
drops this little microphone he says
but every school child who has visited
one of california's redwood parks
knows from reading the signs at the
visitor's center
that in front of the trailheads that
old-growth redwood forests
need fire to survive and thrive in other
words
the number of old redwoods that probably
died in the fire
is zero probably zero
not only is it probable that zero
redwoods died
just as zero redwoods have died in the
past because they're
quite hardy against fires but apparently
it's necessary
because if you didn't clear out the the
lower you know the lower brush
i don't know maybe the redwoods don't
have as much uh
air or whatever they need or light so it
turns out
the redwoods like fires now and then
it's actually good for them so if you
didn't know
if you were if you were not mike
shellenberger and you were not
personally an expert in this category
you would read this story in the front
page of the new york times and you say
ah all the redwoods in california burned
down and none of it's true
it's closer to zero
now the lesson you should take from that
has nothing to do with redwood trees
the lesson you should take from that is
that that's every story
it's every story i'm not mentioning it
because it's a rare
standout situation i'm mentioning it
because
it's a clean example of how they all are
that is the news you just saw the news
that's how it works
it's just completely disconnected from
reality and
probably will stay that way all right
um i'd like to congratulate
democrats um for
an election victory and when i say
congratulations i don't mean that they
necessarily got more votes
maybe they did who knows
but it looks like they pulled off
an amazingly complicated
and elaborate crime and maybe one of the
best ones i've ever seen
now let me give you the context in which
i'm congratulating them
i remember years ago seeing the story in
the news about a a serial killer
and when they started explaining how the
serial killer had
gotten away with it for so long and i
guess he'd built an underground bunker
on his property where he had like a
you know some kind of a torture jail
thing that he was keeping his victims
and i think i was supposed to read the
story and be horrified at the crime
and indeed it was quite horrible and
horrifying
but i found myself also admiring his
work ethic
and i'm not proud of that
i mean i'm not bragging i'm not saying
hey
look at me i'm admiring a serial
killer's work ethic
all i'm saying all i'm saying
is that he had a good work ethic
and when i see the democrats stealing uh
oh i'm sorry i don't want to get banned
when i see the outcome of the
election i say to myself there was a lot
of good work there
it was a lot of good work think about
what it took to keep the the mainstream
media
completely corrupt and and to have them
just
sell a propaganda story to the country
that's hard
it took a lot of the right people
pushing the right buttons
for the mainstream media to do what it
did for so long
and to and to present hoaxes and
fake news as as real news for years
that takes a lot of discipline in a way
then look at um you know well really
that's the main thing that look at
social media
what social media did to influence the
elections
then look at the allegations of all the
the distributed
um smaller frauds allegedly allegedly
that were distributed in a way that if
you even if you found a bunch of them
they wouldn't add up enough for the
supreme court to overturn an election
it's brilliant crime i i call it
packetized
i'd like that to become a thing i i
believe we should
we should create a new phrase
packetized crime packetized meaning they
take a big crime and they break it into
little bunches and they say okay
in this precinct you'll vote with some
dead people
over here you'll you know you'll have
some people who
weren't old enough to vote that's not
how they did it but
that's an example of just packetizing it
then somebody gets caught
and they take it to court and they go
yeah you know you proved that this is
fraud
but it's not big enough it's not big
enough to change the outcomes
so we don't want to get involved it's
really really impressive if you look at
if you were to look at the the whole
body of work
that created this gigantic ball of
that the public is so far chewing on
like it's breakfast
i'm actually literally impressed there's
no
you know i'm not this isn't satire it's
not parody
this is impressive criminal work like a
really good stuff
so uh there's that um
and i asked this provocative question
and i know i know that
from a legal basis obviously i know that
this is not a real thing
but i put it out there just to make
people
think a little bit right here was my
tweet i said hypothetically
and the hypothetical is important here
hypothetically
if the mainstream media and here's
here's the interesting part
the 50 past and president in present
intel professionals who defended hunter
biden
so the entire you know fake news media
plus 50 past and present
intel people all supported
hunter biden as completely you know
innocent and that is probably russian
disinformation
what do we know now now we know
it wasn't russian disinformation or if
it was it was also true
we know that hunter biden had a lot
going on
we know that the president as he
gleefully uh
tweeted today we know the president was
right
when he was trying to get the ukrainians
to look into things
because it looks like there were some
some things to look into
so at this point since we know the media
colluded
to get biden elected i mean we know that
and we know that the all these intel
people are you telling me that there
were 50
highly connected intel people who signed
this letter
are you telling me that none of them and
nobody in the mainstream news nobody
all of these investigative reporters and
nobody in the
intel community where you know there are
leaks
everywhere in the world and none of
these people
were aware of all of the problems that
hunter biden was
already in with current investigations
now if you're telling me that that's not
organized i don't know what organized is
so i asked the question if the
mainstream media and these intel
professionals if they knowingly and
knowingly is the key word
if they knowingly protected an ongoing
criminal enterprise
isn't it a ricoh case
so a ricoh case you know roughly
speaking there's some
some technical details to it but a ricoh
case is an
organized ongoing criminal enterprise
the allegations against hunter are not
that he did one
crime i don't know if he'll be you know
if any of it's true
right allegations or allegations but if
it's true
that hunter biden had some kind of an
ongoing criminal
activity and it's true that the
mainstream
press and the intel professionals that
signed
were protecting him now they may have
been protecting him for their own
reasons
you know they may have been protecting
him not because they cared about hunter
but because it would be bad for them if
things got out
but doesn't that still qualify
now i know the answer is no it's not
really a ricoh case
scott scott scott you're not a lawyer
and you don't understand
this isn't like those other situations
it's not like the mafia
but isn't it it's not like the mafia
but isn't it isn't it
now there's nobody getting killed in
these specific cases
but the mafia also does extortion and
regular crimes and you know they do
white-collar crimes as well
right so is there really a difference
between the mafia let me give an example
does everybody who would be helping the
mafia
allegedly if do you think that all of
them are part of the mafia
or do you think that for example the
mafia might have
let's say some police officers who are
on the take
maybe they own a few judges right
so you don't have to be in the mafia
to be part of a large criminal
enterprise do you
you know can't you be a corrupted judge
you're not the mafia but you're
part of helping right so i don't see a
lot of difference
conceptually obviously legally it's not
going to be
rico case and i know that but
conceptually
this is organized crime is it not
looks like it all right looks like the
nobel peace prize
went to the world food program the world
food program
i'm sure that the world food program did
a good job
because and and you know they deserve
the peace prize because
when you think of feeding people you
think of peace
do you or do you think that feeding
people is just good by itself
maybe feeding people should just stand
alone
maybe the nobel peace prize should have
something to do with
peace you know i get it that feeding
people
helps keep the peace i mean i get it
that they're connected
but in that way isn't everything
connected i mean
you know electricity probably helps the
piece too
do you give the nobel peace prize to
electricity
so well i think the world food program
probably did a great job
and i would like to congratulate them
because i'm sure people looked into it
and said this is terrific
so no no slight to them great work
people i'm glad i'm glad we have
something called a world food program
that sounds like a really really really
good thing
but they gave that prize to them
just the trump didn't they
the nobel peace prize just became a well
i guess it's always been political
but it's so nakedly political when
you've got
uh trump i mean trump so
won the nobel peace prize i don't think
even his
critics would disagree that if you're
narrowly looking at
you know peace it was trump
all right i've never seen a cleaner
example
of somebody who won the prize and didn't
win the prize
i mean trump won this times 10. there's
nobody who i don't think
name seriously in all seriousness with
no hyperbole
name one person in the whole
 world
who deserved it more than trump did this
year if you look at the middle east you
look at
you know uh if you look at north korea
you look at
uh what serbia i mean it's not even
close
he he drew down the military and the
you know it's not even close
there is nobody who's ever deserved a
nobel peace prize
more than trump nobody it's not even
close
yeah maybe jared you know you could make
an argument for jared
um so
uh here's another way that the
simulation
is winking at you in a fun way here's
the best thing about 2020
2020 has been i th can we all agree it's
been just the worst year
2020 is a pretty bad year right pretty
bad year
but there's one thing about 2020 that
i'm going to appreciate and i'd like to
call it out
because i like to say the glasses the
gras
the glass is uh half full
and it's this you're never
going to in the rest of your life you
will never hear
representative swalwell say that the
allegations
against him for the chinese spy
is gaslighting that's it
that's a word that representative eric
swalwell cannot use in public
he can never use the phrase gaslighting
because you know he wants to he wants to
say that these allegations against him
are gaslighting
but he can't he can't because he's
famous for farting
no i don't think he actually farted on
camera but he's famous for
the allegation that he farted on camera
so he can't use the word gaslighting
because if he ever says that word in
public
again social media will go crazy
ah he said gaslighting he said gas
lighting you better not light your gas
if you know what i mean
you're gonna blow the back of your pants
out so
there is nothing funnier in terms of the
simulation
than the fact that eric swalwell
specifically him
can never again use the word gaslighting
it's just perfect
if if biden gets inaugurated as
i think most people are expecting no
matter what they thought of the
actual election i think people at this
point do expect
biden to be inaugurated if he does
can we say
will we be able to say if biden was
inaugurated that the swamp
drained trump because that's what it
looks like doesn't it
it looks like trump tried to drain the
swamp but the swamp
drain trump and low information voters
um are going to think that
that was the will of the people if
you're a low information voter
the news which is part of this criminal
enterprise
rico situation the news is going to tell
you
that there was a vote and that the will
of the people
was displayed and that the will of the
people
picked big biden
but we know that nothing like that
happened
and i'm not even talking about election
fraud
if you know we talked about uh joel
pollock's uh
book uh which i'll now forget the name
of neither fair nor
free it's a tough title to remember joel
you have to work on a title that is
easier to remember
but he makes the case in his new book
which i think is number one in his
category and you should
buy so just look for joel pollock on
amazon
p-o-l-l-a-k and he talks about
everything from the
social media uh manipulation of the
search results
to the fake news just making up news to
you know that structure and once you see
the whole structure
if you're a high information voter you
realize that
the only thing that didn't matter in
this election was the will of the people
because the will of the people was
simply assigned to them
the social media and the fake news
assign opinions
if you believe that people just come up
with their own opinions
you're stuck in 2015 thinking
most of us have learned since at least
since 2016
most people now understand that people
don't come to their own conclusions
make their own opinions that's not a
thing scientifically
it's not a thing so these are assigned
opinions by the people in this ricoh
criminal organization all right
um you're all waiting for my uh joe
biden angry joe biden impersonation
i think he should be but before that
let's talk about congress so congress
continues to be
worthless and they continue to not
put together the kind of bill that we
need let me give congress
some advice congress here's some advice
if somebody is offering a you know a
larger bill
or somebody has a smaller bill and maybe
they have different things in them
if you can't agree just pick the larger
one
pick the larger one that will never be
the wrong answer just pick the big one
now there is this question about the
protection
for lawsuits that i guess the
republicans want to have protection
against
coronavirus lawsuits in other words
protection against
somebody saying i got coronavirus in
your
uh uh in your
in your company so i'm going to sue you
because you didn't do enough controls to
keep me from getting coronavirus
now the democrats say we can't do that
because the people have to have the
right to sue otherwise companies won't
do the right thing they need they need
that pressure on them
but here's what people who think that's
a good idea don't know
you don't know what it's like to own a
small business
let me explain to you what is
like
to own a small business now if i may i
don't like i generally don't like to
talk
on behalf of other people but i'm going
to make an exception here
i'm going to speak without being asked
to i know it's inappropriate
but i'm going to speak on behalf of
small business owners
now i don't think you'll mind after you
hear me say it all right
so this is for the benefit of small
business owners
and i speak as one because i've owned a
couple of small restaurants
and let me tell you what you learn if
you're a small business
owner and i say this for all you small
business owners
you will get sued if you're a small
business owner
you will get sued for
do you know what i got sued for when i
owned the business got sued for
when i was a restaurant owner nothing
but we still got sued and by nothing i
mean
there were no victims nobody even
claimed to be a victim
believe can you believe that no victims
nobody even claimed to be disadvantaged
and i still got sued because
there was some technicality
that allowed it to be possible more than
once
if you are a small business owner you
know
what the in congress
don't know because they haven't had a
 job where they had to meet a
payroll
if you're a small business owner your
number one risk
number one is getting sued
illegitimately
it's your number one risk you
should not even be in business if you
can't have this kind of protection
democrats are not
having some principle disagreement
they're not trying to protect
protect the system and protect the
people so that the
the businesses will do the right thing
nothing like that is happening
democrats who are holding this up are
uninformed every small business
owner will tell you what i'm telling you
right now
if you don't have that protection the
odds of you getting sued
by somebody who can simply make a case
they're going to say
the server came over and their mask fell
down while they were talking to me
and i got covered i walked in and there
should have been more
barriers i didn't see anybody
disinfecting things between
customers you see where i'm going do you
know which businesses are gonna get sued
every business every one of them
they're all gonna get sued
this is just a payday for
lawyers and do you know why the
the lawyers get a payday because
they're part of this criminal
 organization that made this
this result this what you're watching
is a crime happening right in
front of you
the trial lawyers i guess that would be
my best guess
are trying to do this for whatever their
own reason is they obviously have enough
control over congress
to stop the whole country from
eating
there are people suffering in
unbelievable ways right now
and it's because there's some number of
democrats who are
stupid they don't know that the biggest
risk
is this these illegitimate lawsuits for
a small business
if you've never been in a small business
don't vote
right if you haven't actually run a
small business
and you're in congress don't
vote on this
you do you haven't earned it you haven't
earned it
you don't know what you're doing you're
not capable you're not competent
you're uninformed let somebody
who's owned
who's owned a small business set
you straight
it's a big deal and if you want to give
a bonus to your
lawyer friends who helped you steal the
goddamn
i'm sorry you don't like it when i use
that word
to steal the election
this is what you do so here's here's my
solution for it
the problem with congress the way it's
organized is that they don't have
any incentive to do a good job do they
congress as a whole has no incentive to
do a good job
because every one of those
 is going to get reelected
something like 99 percent right if you
were not going to lose your job
no matter whether you did your job or
not would you do your job
no that's socialism congress is teaching
you
how socialism works socialism has a
problem
it dis disincentivizes people your
motivation to work
is less because you don't get to keep
much of what you work for right
congress is modeling that behavior they
have no motivation to do the job
of the people
none they can just go to their
happy christmas
and leave you to starve and it
doesn't matter to them
they'll still get reelected so here's my
suggestion
if this sounds like a humorous
suggestion it's not
you might laugh at it but what follows
is a serious
suggestion we should stop paying them
but not legislatively this is the key
part of the system
somebody has the job of processing the
payroll
right there's somebody's job it is to
push the buttons and do whatever needs
to be done
that a payroll check or a payroll
deposit probably direct deposit
is produced and it goes into the
bank accounts of people in congress
there are people just
it's just a job right the people doing
those jobs
should do them poorly other words
they should not decide anything they
should not decide
whether congress gets a check because
it's not their decision right
the people who process the payroll are
not in charge
of whether payroll you know there should
be a payroll
they simply are the ones who make it
happen
and what i'm suggesting is they should
work
slower what i'm suggesting is that maybe
they should
accidentally push a button that stops
payroll going just to congress
not to anybody else just to congress and
when somebody asks them to fix it they
should say yes
they should say yes then take their time
just take their time and if somebody
says hey why haven't you fixed this yet
we're not getting our paychecks
then the people in the payroll and i'm
not talking about anybody in charge
i'm talking about the employees
individual employees
now of course you need your boss to be
on board right because you don't want to
get fired but the the individual
employees should say yes
yes we'll go fix that we're right we're
on it
we're all over that we're gonna go fix
that
it got busy well it wasn't my fault i
had a sick day
i was gonna fix that in one minute
but i got i might have a little
coronavirus
i had i had to stay home couldn't fix it
so in all seriousness since i know the
small business owners have too much to
do
and uh they don't have the funds to do
this frankly
what we should do if we were a
functioning
society we should surround the capital
physically surround it and not let
anybody out until they pass a bill
i don't think congress should get to go
home
i don't think they should get to go home
my first choice but
it's it's less practical it's hard to do
would be
to physically blockade the capital
and just say here's the deal you're not
going home
until you do something that's the work
of the people
because you don't have any motivation
right now to do your job
so let's surround the capital and give
them some motivation
to do their job that's all now
if i don't think that's going to happen
right because you need a certain kind of
organization to make that happen
if if soros isn't funding it or the
chinese it probably doesn't happen right
so i don't think that's going to happen
so i'm calling upon the people
who are in charge of payroll and i don't
know if
the trump administration could whisper
in their ear and just say
we'd like everyone else to get a
paycheck just not congress
and it's not going to be a decision
right that's the important part
it's not a decision to withhold their
pay
we're just a little bit inefficient and
i think
and and by the way there's some
precedent for this
i got this idea when i worked at a bank
my first job at a college was a bank
teller and as a bank teller you're given
a bunch of rules
and they say if you if you don't follow
all of these rules you will be fired
now the problem was that if you followed
all the rules
you literally couldn't do your job i
don't mean
you know it would be hard to do your job
you actually couldn't you wouldn't be
able to handle
enough customers in the whole day
because you would
you'd be obsessed with you know meeting
the requirements
and it would be like okay you can't do
this transaction you have to get two
signatures from a
you know supervisor or whatever so
we would occasionally as tellers we
would get
reprimanded for doing something that was
not specifically
right now it didn't cost any money
nobody got in trouble
but it wasn't technically what you
should have been doing you just cut some
corners to do the job
of you know serving the customer what
did the employees do
when the supervisor would come down on
them for skipping
some not too important step i'll tell
you what we did
we started following their rules
and do you know what happened the line
was snaked all the way out the door and
around halfway around the block
because when we started following the
rules and doing the job
as it was described you couldn't do the
job
and so we as tellers we'd say got it
we got it we don't want to be yelled at
we don't want to be fired we're going to
follow every one of your rules
and then the management would just
 panic and we would watch them
running around
they'd all be like talking to each other
like what the happening
why is not even a single customer
getting waited on and why did the line
go all the way out the door and around
the block
why are all the customers complaining
because nobody can get any service
do you know why because we followed your
 rules
that's why we we went on strike
by doing our job so
there is precedent for employees being
let's say less efficient than they
possibly could be
for a greater purpose so i call on the
payroll organizers but only if your
bosses are willing to not fire you for
it
to be way less efficient way less
efficient
just for those congressional checks
completely serious in case anybody
thinks this is a joke
there's no joke here they should not be
getting a paycheck
i apologize to joe biden and i don't
often do this
but i've said some things about joe
biden and i would like to apologize
and again i'm not joking
it's going to sound like i'm joking but
i'm not i called him
an for using the fine people
hoax to get elected
and the reason i called him an
is that it paints the president that is
a racist which paints his supporters as
racist supporters at the very least and
i thought that was a really really
 thing to do but we have some
there was a
interview that he just did that was
fascinating because now that he believes
he's been elected
he doesn't need to lie anymore right or
at least he doesn't need to tell the
same kind of
lies and it is in his interview
he described you know why he ran for
office and remember he's already won
according to him and he said that he had
three reasons
and his number one reason was the fine
people
thing that he doesn't know is a hoax
and here's why i'm apologizing
i thought he knew
so i'm guilty i'm guilty of the thing
that i i talk the most about
which is mind reading so mind reading is
you think you know what somebody's
thinking or their motivation for why
they're doing something
i actually gave him the benefit of a
doubt
i i thought he knew he was lying so
therefore i thought that was the most
 thing i've seen in a long time
but when you hear him talking about it
with such sincerity
after getting elected it would be one
thing before election because you know
then it's
transactional right he's just doing it
for a fact he knows he's lying it's
typical for politicians to lie
intentionally
i thought it was just that he
actually doesn't know it's a hoax
it's actually a brain problem
this is pretty pathetic but i apologize
because i called him an and that
very clearly now at least in my
opinion that wasn't what was going on
he actually thought it was real now i
tweeted about this of course
and one of the things that's sort of a
regular habit that i like doing is when
i tweet that the fine people thing is a
hoax
at this point most most republicans are
trained to know it's a hoax
because they've seen the full transcript
but most democrats
still think it's real and so the
democrats will
sort of trickle into the twitter feed
and say
what do you mean it's a hoax what do you
mean it's a hoax
and then what happens is uh people have
been following me for a while and
they know the trade they even have
copies of the transcript at this point
so my followers you know filter in and
just
that they work on the democrat like like
a speed bag
it's like here's the transcript well uh
uh that's not what
i heard here's the video well and they
just sort of pummel
the person who still believes in the
hoax and i feel as if
it's like one person at a time is being
converted
you know and red pilled about how badly
they've been lied to
so i do that for fun it's fun to watch
all right i would like to give you my
impersonation of joe biden
at holiday dinner let's say a christmas
dinner
my impression of joe biden and it's
based on the fact that
i saw a tweet this morning from quark
toro
who tweeted at me and said ever since
ever since you said
why does joe biden always sound angry
that's all i hear
how many of you only hear joe biden
sounding angry now after i
after i pointed out that he always
sounds angry
well i give you now my impression of joe
biden
at holiday dinner
and it looks like this look
here's the deal fast assault
that is good gravy come on folks
three things turkey stuffing
yams people forget the yams
that's malarkey don't forget the ams
don't forget the abs
and the biden harris administration no
one will forget the yams
unless i die before christmas in which
case
it'll be harris administration i don't
even know why i brought that up
just forget i brought that up nothing
about me dying
pass assault
because science real science yams
real science math this
is the best turkey i've ever had
and that is my impression of angry joe
biden
having a delightful holiday dinner
and god bless tiny tim thank you
all right i'm pretty sure that's uh
oh and then of course time magazine
named biden and harris
uh person of the year even though
they're there's two of them
which is the way they do it they always
they always say person of the year even
if it's not a person
but is there any reason that time
magazine
would pick biden and harris as person of
the year as opposed to
trump or fouchy or someone else is there
any reason
other than just trying to bug trump
time magazine turned into like revenge
porn
that's all this time person of the year
went from one of the most prestigious
you know
things that could happen in a person's
life to
literally revenge porn
its only purpose is to make trump
unhappy that's it
no other reason talk about making
yourself irrelevant
there you go
all right um
i hope you enjoyed today's episode of
coffee with scott adams
it's only going to get better every day
so if you'd like to see a little extra
uh especially my micro lessons as i call
them small lessons
on things that will help you be more
effective build your
talent stack without much trouble two
minutes to have a new skill
and those happen on the locals platform
so for subscribers only
they'll see all of my stuff that you
don't see anywhere else
it's called locals.com um that's that's
my commercial for the day
and i will talk to you tomorrow
bye for now
and youtube
yes i'm staying around for another
minute
uh see what you got to ask me
scott were you fooled by the stolen
election hoax
here's my take on it um if you haven't
heard it
if you have a situation where crime can
happen
and there's a gigantic incentive to do
it not even a regular incentive but a
gigantic incentive to do it
and it can happen how often does it
happen
every time 100 so i don't need any
evidence to know that an election was
stolen it should be stolen every time
and in fact if you think any prior
election didn't have a ton of fraud i
don't know if you're
quite ready for the adult table if you
know what i mean
all of our elections have had massive
fraud it is almost certain that the
reason trump got elected in the first
place
i would say this is speculative right i
can't prove this
but speculatively it seems highly likely
that they underestimated because the
polls were so wrong
that the cheaters underestimated how
much they needed to cheat
i feel as if that's all that happened in
2016
and that he probably won by even more
than we know
can't prove that so i won't make it a
claim as a
statement of fact i'll just say seems
highly likely
now if there's anybody here who believes
that there's a situation with
massive incentive to do something
illegal
and complete opportunity to do it
without much chance of getting caught
if you think that that situation does
not guarantee fraud
where have you been living because you
should join the real world
where fraud happens every time every
time
not 90 of the time not even 99
of the time if you wait long enough it's
every time
and there aren't many things you can say
there are very few things you can say
are true every time i like to use the
example of dropping ice cream on a
hot sidewalk in the summer if you leave
it there
there are not sometimes it doesn't melt
you get that right it's not like there's
a probability it'll melt
that's one of those cases where you can
know in advance without even witnessing
it
it melted you don't even have to watch
same with the election
if you can cheat and there's an insane
motivation to do it
because orange hitler of course it
happened you don't need to witness it
it's just like the ice cream on the
sidewalk it has to happen it'll happen
every time
all right so i hope i
beat that horse today uh
oh some of you are agreeing with me
that's good
not in alaska somebody says is 2020 the
golden age
well you know what the the weird thing
about 2020
is that uh and i'll give you the glass
half full
version of it 2020 is just a horrible
year
right it's hard to oh i'm so sorry
somebody just lost
a niece to uh fentanyl
as you know i can i can feel that pain
so that that goes right through me
especially
especially in the holidays um
so i'm sorry for your loss uh
well that hit me a little bit too hard
all right i'm gonna
i think i have to end now see you
tomorrow
