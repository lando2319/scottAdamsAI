morning everybody and welcome to what
might be the dawn of the golden age I
think musk's purchase of Twitter is
changing things more than I thought
and
I feel like it's not changing the
technology so much as how we're thinking
about everything and how we see
everything more about that later but
first how would you like to take it up a
notch all the way from the most exciting
thing that's ever happened to you coffee
with Scott Adams do something
Transcendent well if you'd like to do
that all you need is a
copper bug or a glass of Tankard
Chelsea's Diamond canteen Jagger flask
of a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope means the day the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous ship and I
love you too
savor it savor it
savor it
well dilbert.com is down this morning
I don't know why I'll look into it later
but apparently my own website's down I
don't manage it so I guess I'll have to
look into that too
all right I've got to tell you this
story
but I can't get I don't want to give you
the personal identifiers in it so it's
sort of a a real story but I'm going to
change the name
of the story this actually happened to
me last night
so last night I was in an extended
conversation
uh in a digital way over the choice of a
name choice of a name
and the idea was to come up with an
unusual name sort of not a common name
it doesn't it doesn't matter what the
name was for or anything and I'm just
going to make up a name
Mortimer that wasn't the real name
so just imagine that this really
happened but the name is different right
so conversation went like this I'm
thinking of Mortimer or or Mort
yeah that's great you know that's that's
great for a number of reasons all right
all right that's the name it's going to
be Mortimer
now keep in mind that Mortimer I picked
it in my example because it's a very
unusual name
you don't really well Morty yeah but you
don't hear Mortimer too much do you
now the real name was not Mortimer it
was another one but it was it was as
unusual as that now
30 minutes after this conversation
and I want to say this clearly
it's a name I probably have never used
in 50 years or more
so probably
um it's a name that has never crossed my
lips and rarely would you ever hear it
in the real world it's a very unusual
name
I turned on a TV show from the 70s
from the 70s
and there was an episode in which a huge
a huge scene was all about that name and
what a good name it was
now what the
was that all about
and literally it literally included the
the phrase wow that's a good name
within 30 minutes
what does that mean
I mean seriously
that couldn't have happened by
coincidence could it
I mean it would be here's what a
coincidence would look like
I'm not going to tell you the name of
the show
because I don't want to put a
identifiers in it
but it was just crazy
I and it's the sort of thing where you
have to sit there and think
did I make that happen
I mean was that it would be one thing if
you simply heard the name right
that would be a coincidence because you
see that a lot if the only thing that
happened is you know we talked about
Mortimer and then I turned on the show
and somebody was named Mortimer I
wouldn't think that's a big coincidence
that would just be like an interesting
little thing but it was a whole scene
about whether it was a good name
that is very specific
I mean how often have you even seen the
TV show
that discussed whether a name was a good
name for a person it was just so rare
anyway I was blown away by it
all right so let's talk about something
uh
some persuasion tips for you
so I tweeted today as you know it's been
my mission to kill ESG before the end of
the year
now when I say kill it I mean mortally
wounded right it's still going to limp
along for a while but by the end of this
year
I want to make it difficult for anyone
to think ESG is a good idea like you
should sort of automatically
feel a little embarrassed if you
mentioned it
and so I tweeted this I said If by 2023
just you know once for now if by 2023
you still think ESG is a public good as
opposed to a money-making scheme that's
on you
now let me explain the persuasion
that is embedded in this simple tweet
number one I put a date on it so it
makes it sound a little more serious
whenever you put a date on something
where you put a number on it
it takes a a concept that doesn't exist
and just hardens it so now it's like a
little more real because there's a date
do you remember what I said
uh
provocatively back in
2020. I said that if uh Biden got
elected there's a good there's a good
chance you'll be dead in a year
what what was the operative part about
that the Dead
or the year
well they're both pretty operative but
the year actually is pretty operative
yeah the year is what makes it solid
like oh it's not just a a concern
if I said there's a good chance you'll
be dead
then that would just be sort of a
free-floating concern but as soon as I
put it within a year they hardened it
and then everybody got excited about it
so I did the same thing by 2023 if you
still think ESG is a public good here's
the next trick I said if you still think
what's the persuasion in that if you
still think
tell me what the persuasion trick is
yeah the the trick of course it's the
word still but the trick is to make
somebody embarrassed
that they got left behind
have you ever had that feeling wait a
minute why does everybody know something
that I don't know
so I'm I'm creating the uh impression
the the smart people have already moved
past you
you don't want to be the the person who
got left behind when the smart people
have already moved to a better opinion
right it makes you automatically
competitive
so I'm creating people's I'm stimulating
their competitive juices by saying well
if you got left behind
you know and then I say as opposed to a
money-making scheme now how hard is it
to convince anybody anywhere of any
persuasion
that there's something that's really a
money-making scheme it is not to their
benefit
that's the easiest thing you can you can
convince anybody of
you can pick anything
say you know
that a Catholic church it's really a
money-making scheme I'm not saying that
I'm saying you could pick anything and
just say it's a money making scheme and
the public is sort of primed to agree
with that wouldn't you say
vaccinations it's not to help the public
it's a money-making scheme you're right
you're right right so people's heads are
just going to Bob automatically when you
say money making scheme
the Democrats or the Republicans pick
anybody they're not they're not a real
party they're a money-making scheme it's
just automatic so I've got all the
automatics in there I'm making you think
past the sale I've got a high ground
maneuver I've got a date to harden it
I've got an alternative so you can you
know imagine the alternative and that I
ended with that's on you if you still
think yes she's a public good that's on
you
because I want people to know
that they will literally be embarrassed
to hold this opinion longer
you will be embarrassed to hold this
opinion
now this also
very subtly gives you an out
because you know what triggers cognitive
dissonance
what triggers cognitive dissonance as
being wrong
and then being shown to be wrong
in sort of a way that other people can
notice especially
so I've allowed that there's something
like an evolution involved here it's not
like you were wrong and now I have to
convince you to be right because that
would just trigger a cognitive
dissonance instead I'll say you know
we're all on this path
the path from thinking it was good to
realizing it's a money-making scheme so
you I we're all the same you're on the
path I'm on the path but I'm going to
take the path
if you decide to move slower or don't
take the path well that would be on you
but the path is there for all of us
right it's not like I'm special I'm not
arrogant you're dumb nothing like that
the path is there just get on it
all right so you can see that you can
pack a lot into about 20 words or
whatever that was
and I can tell it works because although
it didn't get a lot of retweets relative
to you know my most retweetable stuff uh
it did get over 2200 likes which in my
universe would be
showing strong approval for the the
tweet
all right
it also makes you research forgot to
mention if you can if you can do some
persuasion that makes somebody go look
it up
that's a real winner because if somebody
takes the time to research whether what
you said is true or to research any part
of it then that becomes much stickier
than something that somebody heard and
then didn't act on with their with their
muscles and their brains and their their
you know their actual body
all right here are two words that I
would like you to remove from your
vocabulary as much as possible
this is not a standard which I can
achieve myself so it's sort of like a
you know something to aim for it but we
can't really Reach This goal
and that is to stop using the words must
and should
in terms of argument
must and should must and should are very
handy words when you're just trying to
not discuss something
if you want to not have an argument just
say somebody must do something like a
child
no yeah I don't want to hear your
reasons you you must do this no you must
yeah I know you have reasons but you
must do this so that would be a good use
of must
Ard is the same thing
should
tries to trick you into thinking there
are reasons
but it's just a word
it's just a should
So when you say should or you say must
the first thing that goes off in my head
is oh you don't have an argument
right because people don't use those
words when they have reasons
here's what a reason sounds like oh if
you do that there's a high risk you'll
die
that's different than you shouldn't do
that
right it's pretty different
so don't use bust and should
or at least reduce them
I asked this question because it's
really
I mean in some ways it's the biggest
question in the country and it's weird
to have little attention it gets at the
same time it gets lots of attention
meaning that all the people giving you
detention giving it attention live in
bubbles
and their bubbles don't collide
so here's the question
do you know anybody personally
personally not something you read about
but do you know anybody personally
who you suspect
suspect is a key word because you don't
know do you know any personally that you
suspect
uh died from a vaccination complication
so now my my Twitter followers are
anything but a random group they they
lean right
um but how what percentage do you
imagine believe that they know somebody
who died
actually died
from a vaccination
and the answer is uh 24 percent
which is roughly a quarter
you know so you could round it some
people would round that to 25 but I'm
not making any point about it I'm I'm
just saying rounds
now I'm just I'm just sort of being a
deck the the 25 rule that I always joke
about that 25 of the public will get
every poll question wrong it doesn't
matter what the question is there's just
something magic about that number 25 get
everything wrong
but I don't think that I don't think
that applies
in this particular case in this
particular case I'm going to give you an
exception and and not and not do the 25
rule because that's just for fun this is
actually life and death
now let me ask you this
if you had never heard of vaccinations
would you have even noticed
because I wonder how often people die
you know for reasons that they're too
young I mean are there that many people
dying unexpectedly
you know I mean there are lots of
reasons for extra excess deaths
everything from health care that was
deferred to people got fatter to
they maybe they have a long covet I
don't know
yeah it's the healthy ones I say it's
the healthy ones are dying I don't know
here's what I can't understand
if it's true imagine it's true that
something like a quarter of you uh
actually personally know somebody who
was who died unexpectedly meaning
they're not
filled with comorbidities and 80 years
old that they're young and nothing
obviously wrong with them don't you
think that if a quarter of you were
seeing this in the real world and it was
real
don't you think the medical community
would be more aggressive about this or
do we still believe that they're they're
just worried about their
their paychecks
and there's something of this scale
they would still ignore
what would be the skill at which you
think there would be a Tipping Point is
this just a mental exercise
now I'm not convinced that the these
unexplained deaths are vaccinated
related I'm not convinced I could be
you I could be so let me be really clear
if it turns out that they are a
vaccinated vaccination related don't
come to me and say you said that wasn't
the case I never said that
I'm saying I don't have information that
I find
compelling personally
but it's there's nothing to rule it out
I'm not aware of anything to rule down
are you
is there anything that would rule out
the possibility that there is an unusual
amount of vaccination related deaths I'm
not aware of anything
but I'm not aware of anything that
confirms it either
so
um but let me ask you this question just
hypothetically
suppose uh I suppose 75 percent of you
were aware of somebody personally who
died probably from a vaccination you
don't know
but the the timing suggested suppose 75
percent of you are aware of that do you
think that the medical community could
still say yeah but paychecks
suppose a million people a year started
dying unexpectedly
with the medical community as a whole
still say
um
paychecks gotta get our paychecks no
would you still see only the Rogues
would it still be just you know Dr
McCullough and Dr Malone would they
still be the only ones out there
not the only ones there are other other
ones out there
but I'm just wondering if do you see any
Tipping Point
is there any level at which this
suspected problem if the suspected part
got bigger and bigger isn't any level
that people would go against their
economic interest
I don't know
I don't know
at some point even the you know the
media would notice right
well here's the thing to me it's already
at that level where I can't imagine the
medical community
would not have risen that one and said
all right
we're going to have to take this
seriously
so there's something going on here I
don't know exactly what it is it's an
interesting mystery
all right
let me cause some real trouble here
I tweeted today to make everybody angry
and this is based on a bunch of stuff
I'm seeing on social media so this is
not Scott was sitting there and cooked
up a new thing to be provocative
this is Scott keep seeing the same thing
on social media and the same thing is
that marriage doesn't work
because women are incentivized to cheat
and take your money and leave
and I'm seeing women say it basically
there's there's one woman in particular
who's getting a lot of a lot of retweets
on or a lot of
getting a lot of attention on mostly
Instagram
and the idea goes like this
um two people are dating and they show
each other their best side
so they decide to get married and as
soon as you're married you you end up
relaxing right you don't you don't
you're not as romantic and
you have kids and then the kids are the
priority and you get busy and you see
each other you know dirty and unwashed
and you sick and every other bad thing
so you've got some challenges now in the
past
that was still enough to stay married I
don't know if they're happy or not but
people more more likely to stay married
but in the modern world the if I ever
told you to follow the money
you know one of my most consistent
themes is that follow the money works
even when you don't think you should
right it just works every time just it's
so consistent
and the idea is that if a young woman
gets married to a guy who's got some
money
and then she decides to divorce him she
gets you know a portion of that money
and then she can just go find another
guy who's more exciting
so she doesn't have to stay with a
sub-optimal guy when she can take money
and and improve her situation by just
cheating and ruining the marriage and
moving on
now and there's always someone more
exciting because social media makes
everything
uh everything possible now
here's what I think is the biggest
um biggest you that the public has
ever given itself
we keep blaming each other for this
cut it out
cut it out
yeah like if two people have a divorce
what do we say about them
we're we say well you picked
wrong you picked wrong right it's on you
you picked wrong
it's not your fault
the fault is that Society is designed to
sort of encourage you to get into this
one kind of arrangement and it simply
doesn't work in 2022 for most people
now are there people for whom it works
yes yes can we all agree on that
could we all agree that people are so
different
that you could pick anything and it
works for somebody right
is there somebody in the world who can
smoke cigarettes every day of their life
and live to a hundred yes yes does that
mean you should smoke cigarettes no no
it means that we're so different
everybody can find something that works
that might not work for you
but
in my opinion it is obvious that
marriage doesn't work in 2022.
it's obvious
and I think we all see it
but we don't have an option
there's no option because let me be very
clear being single isn't that good
uh I mean I've been married and I've
been single I can tell you there are two
conditions that definitely don't satisfy
one is being single and one is being
married those are two conditions that
absolutely do not need meet the needs of
a modern person
or many of us you know again everybody
is different
so yes marriage 100 meets the needs of
some people
there's just not many of them or not
enough of them I guess right now I've
heard a bunch of people say well if you
tweak this if you tweak that I don't
think so
I don't think so I you know I don't
think
uh you know I don't think having
multiple couples works I don't know
anything
that works I'm not aware of any method
that works sort of generally
and if you're going to design the system
of marriage it didn't exist
would you ever have designed this system
I mean think about it like if if no one
had ever thought of marriage
well you just didn't exist
would you have come up with it
because so here's the problem
um in the old days men and women offered
something to each other
that they couldn't they couldn't do on
their own right
because if the guys that were farming
all day the guy can't have the baby
the guy can't you know raise the baby if
he's also farming you know so so it made
complete sense at one point it made
economic sense
it made social sense it made survival
sense it made sense in every way
now you go to 2022 and now the entire
last 50 years have been dedicated to
make individuals not need anybody am I
right
the last 50 years of social change are
mostly about making each individual
capable of supporting themselves in
every way that you can support yourself
you can get a job you can get your own
health care you can hire a nanny you can
you can find friends on the internet
basically everything you need
can be provided in other ways and
Society is very hard has pushed very
hard to make sure that a woman
can not only get married if she wants to
but she can have you know a good as good
or better job than the guy she married
don't we all agree with that being a
good idea right so it's not like it's a
bad idea
is there anybody who thinks women should
make less than men for doing the same
work
I've never met anybody who had that
opinion
have you have you ever met anybody who
thought a woman should be paid less for
doing exactly the same job as a man I've
never met one person with that opinion
so we're all happy about the changes
all right so here's Captain Hank and by
the way just so you're doing nothing
sexist Hank you stupid
let me say again
my simple point
if you believe the problem is the people
chose wrong
you are in a serious delusion it's very
obvious that that's not the problem
because if people choosing wrong
is part of the system and we can't do it
right that means the system is broken
if people were capable of choosing right
well then I'd say well that's a good
system you you take this system and then
you add people to it who can choose
correctly on a consistent basis you've
got a good system there captain
but if you know you're not
guessing
you're not guessing you know this
doesn't work for half of the people who
try it at least I think it's 75 percent
but you know it doesn't so stop acting
like the people are broken and the
system works
not true the system can't work
for most people in 2022.
and now because some of you will not be
able to handle this point I have to keep
saying it can definitely work for some
of you
and I know that no matter how many times
I say it definitely is perfect for some
of you
the argument will be
but it works for me
no that's not an argument
the fact that it works for you doesn't
really conflict with my point at all not
at all
not at all it's completely compatible
with my point it works for some of you
now why does this illusion persist
would you like me to give you a
demonstration right now why this
illusion persists despite the
obviousness of it being false I'm going
to give you a a working model of it
right now
married men
married men just the married men
tell me if you're happy in your marriage
go
married men are you happy in your
marriage
a lot of yeses look at all those yeses
now some people said no but
overwhelmingly yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
have I ever mentioned that all men are
liars
here's another you know Meme that's
going around the internet
if as a woman you force your man to lie
to you he will do what he needs to do to
survive
and they're doing it right now
they're all lying to you in
public
again let me adjust some of you
some of you are genuinely happy some of
you pick the right people for some of
you marriage is perfect are we okay have
I stipulated that again every one minute
because you can't have this conversation
unless you stipulate that every
one minute let me do it again let me
stipulate some people some few people
marriage is perfect
don't use that argument for the rest of
us
don't use that argument for the rest of
us do you know what is good for some
people sucking a dick
for some people sucking a dick is a
great day
it just isn't for everybody okay
so no matter how much you love sucking a
dick and I'm okay with that by the way
I'm not
I'm not it's not a criticism I'm just
saying that people are different right
if that's your thing do not argue that
it's my thing and everybody else's thing
because you love it so much right same
with marriage it's just like sucking a
dick
is some is something that works great
for some people
it's just not an argument for everybody
else
all right
um
and uh let's see
so I think men are lying about how happy
they are and also there's some
um
you know cognitive dissonance that goes
into there
but I also think men are easier to
please
uh let me give you all right I'm just
going to say it
I'm just going to say it
you know so you always think to yourself
how honest do you want to be
so I'm going to be a little extra honest
it's my belief after living living a
lifetime
that evolution is created a situation in
which
the most natural arrangement for a man
and woman
is a woman who cannot be pleased
and a man who doesn't know that she
cannot be pleased and he's pretty sure
that the next thing he does is going to
get it done
because men are perpetually fooled by
women who say if you give me one more
thing I'll be happy
if you just do this one thing
I get I got one complaint
I just have one problem seriously just
one problem if you could fix this one
problem well thank you thank you for
fixing that one problem
well I have this other problem
right now
now let me let me be really clear
am I telling you there's something wrong
with women
no
nope I'm telling you that I believe
that we evolve this way for the best
possible reason that it seems to be
supportive of having children
it seems to help us survive as a species
but if you don't see the world in those
terms you're sort of living in a dream
world
right now why does a marriage sometimes
work if there's a woman who can never be
happy and there's a man who is
continually
uh fooled into thinking he can make it
work
why did why are some people still happy
and the answer is
everybody's really different
some people like that
for some people that's a perfect
situation
have you not met men
who are happier giving than receiving
Am I Wrong you've met men who are
happier giving than the receiving so
they're just always giving and that's
just a good situation for them there's
nothing wrong with that
again I'm not criticizing if you heard
anything if you heard anything in any of
this that sounds like me picking out
with somebody and criticizing them I
haven't done that
I'm talking about the system is broken
the people are good in fact it's the
opposite of criticism I'm saying the
people are fine
the system is broken
but you can't see this obvious fact
because all of the men involved in the
system are lying because lying is what
keeps the system working
you have to sort of lie to yourself that
this is okay to be in it
so that's my
cheerful
[Music]
and and to be clear I'm not aware of any
alternative that's better than marriage
so let me end on the positive
I don't know anything's better do you
if you do I'd be sort of curious about
that
um
all right I heard from a marriage
counselor
who saw my tweet and said as a marriage
counselor who teaches the gottman method
now the goblin method I don't know much
about but there was a little chart
involved I guess the chart involves uh
teaching couples to act differently
so it's basically a set of things like
in this situation you know do more of
this and less of that in this situation
do more of this and less of that so it's
a set of steps that if everybody just
follow these simple guidelines they'd
have better marriages and so this
marriage counselor teaches the gotman
method with success he said he says he
has an unfair advantage of knowing that
I'm wrong
and he'd encouraged me to look and learn
more about the structure and function of
marriage so that if you you know did
these steps you would do better
and uh
and I tweeted back I said you've met
women who are willing to change their
behavior
have any of you seen that
have you ever met a woman who was
willing to change her behavior
I mean seriously I'm not and again if
this sounds like a like a sexist thing I
don't mean it that way
I mean I've never seen it
I'm not saying it's good or bad I've
just never seen it have you
I saw one yes
but most people are saying they've never
seen it
all right so some of you believe you've
seen it
oh I was saying a bunch of yeses
you've actually seen people change their
basic Behavior
what would that look like
let's say let's take an example
let's say the basic behavior is
um
nagging too much right the very sexist
kind of a statement but only say is that
that the the wife let's say the problem
is the wife complains too much about
things that are not that important
and let's say the that that woman uh
learns that that's a toxic Behavior
and agrees to it yeah that is a toxic
Behavior so that the woman stops
complaining about things which bother
her
everything's good now
problem fixed
in what world does that fix anything
because whatever it is that makes the
woman unhappy or complain doesn't change
does it
if she still feels unhappy
or unsatisfied or whatever it isn't she
gonna act that way
one way or another I mean to me it feels
like you know you're
you're blocking one hole but another
hole gets created
reframing maybe some reframing helps
anyway let's talk about Twitter that's
more fun uh did you see the prank I fell
for it too of the the two pranksters who
pretended to be Twitter employees who
had been fired and they stood outside I
guess they stood outside the Twitter
headquarters with their boxes like like
they were leaving
and they gave themselves fake names uh
of uh ligma and Johnson their last names
and I guess they're like
pranksters and uh one of them got
interviewed I saw the interview
and this is what made it a great prank
is that uh so here's the key to a Great
Prank a great prank
has to include at least one indicator
that it's a prank
but the indicator that it's a prank has
to be invisible to the person you're
pranking
but not to The Observers
you got that in other words it had to be
something that the media would accept
but that you as the audience would go
did they fall for that
and here's the statement that the one of
the pranksters said when he was being
interviewed at the end of the interview
when you were saying how he felt about
me getting fired I guess uh he goes all
right I gotta go I have to touch bases
with my husband and wife
all right no you JM
Ramsey
all right how many more times
can I tell you if you're blaming who
somebody picked you are just living in
your own little illusion there
right but like could you hear that Eddie
clear it doesn't matter who you picked
and let me say something that will Amaze
you
because I know you're all you're all
trying to guess about my relationship
the difference is in our ages literally
never came up
I know that's weird
but if you were to look at you know
causes of divorce it I don't think it
was ever even indirectly believe it or
not believe it or not even indirectly it
never became an issue that I'm more of
I mean it should have you know common
sense says it what if but did I tell you
earlier that everybody's different
like everybody's different
that that thing that would have been an
obvious problem for almost anybody else
was less of a problem for us just you
know other stuff right
so no matter how many times I say that
people are different you're still going
to say you picked the wrong person
because I think maybe that's part of
cognitive dissonance or some sort of a
confirmation bias so that you can you
can justify your own situation
all right but the Twitter pranksters are
pretty funny now people seem to be
getting back on uh Twitter who had been
temporarily banned
but we don't think that is necessarily
because of Elon Musk
so uh for example yay is back on Twitter
and musk had to confirm that he didn't
do that that was just an automatic thing
it was like a two-week suspension that
he got put back on so the timing was
coincidental but people think that Elon
Musk put yay back on Twitter but that
did not happen that's fake news
uh but then uh cat turd is back on
and also Marjorie Taylor green so those
are two people who had been
I don't know what the right word is uh
temporarily banned or something whatever
the word is
I think maybe their bands just ran out
or maybe they deleted the tweets so they
could get back on whatever it was but
here's the weirdest thing in the world
you all know the user the Twitter user
cat turd
who's got over a million users
and he's just a clever abundant who's
who's built quite a an audience
I don't follow my I blocked him a long
time ago for being a dick I forget why
but uh Marjorie Taylor green or
retweeted cat turd and said you're
almost to 1 million users ever since
Elon Musk took the shadow bands off and
then she says I'll host a hashtag
turdstock after the party turd stock so
here's a representative of the
government who first of all is
spraying some fake news because Elon
Musk did not remove any Shadow bands
but she's a member of Congress and she's
telling you that that happened that
didn't happen that's fake news
but she's also offering to host third
stock
this is the greatest week ever
I don't think I can enjoy a week of news
more than this week
like I don't really have a a comment or
observation about this I just think it's
the greatest world where representative
Marjorie Taylor green can retweet cat
turd an offer to host turdstock
I just I want to live in this world
I want to live in this world
all right
um stocks were up
yesterday
quite sharply
is that the was that the uh Twitter Elon
Musk effect
was there something else that made the
stock market go up on Friday
GDP report Apple earnings
was that it but we were expecting the
GDP report we we already knew about the
GDP report right
I thought we knew that was going to come
in strong and roughly how strong it
would come in
yeah I don't know
2.6 is that enough to raise the I was
exactly what we expected right so it
feels like that was already baked in
here's what I think
I think that markets move uh we think
they move on the on the news
but if they did move on the news
everybody would be able to guess what
the market would do
you got that right
there there's a whole industry based on
people saying smart things about why the
market did what it did
and the reason there's a big market for
it is that they don't all say the same
thing
if they all said the same thing then it
wouldn't be a market for it just be
everybody would know what's happening
but the financial Market is mostly a
gigantic scam
in which people pretend to tell you they
know why markets did move or have when
they get it right they say well look
there
because remember a market is only going
to do two things it will go up or it
will go down
whichever way it goes there's going to
be a whole bunch of experts who got it
right that time
and they'll come on television they'll
say yeah I got it wrong that other time
but this time well this time I got it
right my reasons were right the outcome
was right boy did I do good
but really the market was going to be up
where it was going to be down and half
of the people were going to be right no
matter what happened
so
um I don't think
I think what we're saying here's my
hypothesis Marcus move for irrational
reasons
but there are people who paid to tell
you they move for more rational reasons
so you imagined that they do because all
these experts tell you that but there's
no evidence of that
all the evidence is the experts don't
know what's going to happen right
they're guessing too
so here's what I think it was just a
guess that the the Elon Musk effect and
Twitter had such a big effect on
optimism
and maybe energy
that it looked like the free markets
were a little bit Freer
no I don't know that there's anything to
that but I would say that yesterday I
felt more optimistic about the country
than at any time and certainly a year or
two or three
I felt actually just giddy
yesterday
I was giddy
I haven't felt that
was the last time I felt that election
night 2016 was a fun night but that's
about it
so something's happening that's bigger
than Twitter and bigger than musk but
maybe that's uh my illusion
don't know
um
so my user numbers went way up so
normally I'd get maybe 200 new followers
a day
uh I got four thousand yesterday
now do you think that I went from a
baseline of 2 200 a day to four thousand
uh just because more people were
interested in joining Twitter
now remember Elon Musk has confirmed
that he's made no change
to who's allowed on
and no change to the algorithm
did everybody go up in other words are
people on the left going up as well
is it Bots
let me put in a hypothesis
now there's there's no knowledge behind
this right so this is pure speculation
imagine if you were the Twitter
engineers and you did in fact know that
the algorithm was suppressing some
people
uh as Paul collider pointed out on
Twitter you can imagine them
architecting that in at least two
different ways one would be there's
something about the algorithm itself
that suppresses conservatives Maybe by
keywords or something like that that'd
be one way to go the other way to go
would be that the algorithm is the
algorithm but that some individuals are
tagged
so if you've been tagged as somebody to
suppress the algorithm just does what an
algorithm does and it it just doesn't
know why it did it it's just just
reading those tags
so
as Paul pointed out cleverly if you
really if you remove the database with
the tags or just remove the tags the
algorithm would look unchanged or it
would be very hard to notice that there
had ever been anything wrong there
you'd have to find the exact thing that
was looking for the tag notice that
there weren't any tags notice that they
used to be I mean you'd have to go
pretty deep
to find out something wrong had happened
if anything wrong happened now
do you think that's what happened do you
think that there's nothing but more
interest in Twitter did let me ask you
this do you think that there were 4 000
people
who didn't think about following me on
Twitter until yesterday
what do you think like is that is that
possible the 4 000 people didn't really
have a notion of following me on Twitter
until yesterday
yeah and it's also election season
right
but still it's a one day change you know
election season's been creeping up for
every day
I don't know a lot of conservatives
signing up that's a good theory so one
Theory would be there were five thousand
conservatives who had left Twitter and
I'm just one of the people that they
would follow when they signed back up
that could be
yeah I'm going to say that the the odds
that they changed the algorithm are low
the odds that um that it was just
conservatives coming back is high
but I wouldn't rule out that they may
have untagged something you know maybe
there was a like a kill switch on there
if the company gets bought you know make
this piece of code disappear
something like that
I don't know seems like you could hide
it pretty well if you wanted to
um so Moss says he's going to be forming
a Content moderation council with widely
diverse views
and that they won't make any decisions
about who to reinstate until this
Council does their work
so we'll find out
um
all right have you noticed that uh the
one I say this a lot but if you see a
story on the internet that makes your
head explode
what's the first thing you should know
is most likely
true about that story
it's fake yeah and when I say most
likely I don't mean 51 percent
I mean closer to 95 98 right
if that they had exploded stories are
almost always fake
so the story about uh Elon Musk
immediately reinstating yay which was
fake news made you I saw on Twitter
heads were exploding how can you let him
back on that anti-semite and of course
the answer is if your head exploded
it probably didn't happen and sure
enough it didn't
foreign
on this uh Jack dorsey's new
product I guess it's going to launch
soon it's already got beta users I think
it's called Blue Sky I may have used the
wrong name for it yesterday I don't know
what Zion is
so I'm a little confused about what's
the product maybe what's the technology
but the idea here is apparently there
are multiple
social networks in some kind of
formative stage they were trying to
solve the problem
the current social medias don't solve
which is too much consolidation to power
in the government government could you
know force them to do something
so the ideal situation would be you
could post on any social network you
would always own your own data so nobody
else could influence it and there
wouldn't be any uh corporate entity that
could be be influenced by money
and I don't even know if if blue sky is
a money-making venture I'm I'm that
confused about it I'll probably know by
the end of the day
but is Blue Sky a open like uh open code
open network for the benefit of the
world
or is it a money-making venture
it's open source but that doesn't mean
it's
doesn't mean it's for not-for-profit
so I'm a little confused about what's
going on but at least there's a there's
a possibility
that there's something you have
blockchain related open system
that people might enjoy that would have
less government influence
Maybe
yeah and then you could own your own
data now that's one of the benefits of
the locals platform so I'll give a
little commercial for it so I'm uh I
have a subscription Community within the
locals platform and part of the deal
there I'm also an investor
um part of the deal there is that I get
to keep all my user data so I have X
number of users or subscribers or
community members and
uh
presumably if I decided not to use
locals anymore I get to keep my
my list of users
so I mean that seems fair
all right let's talk about Paul Pelosi
number one
uh
he he's a fighter at 82.
I like the fact that at 82 he was
willing to get into a physical
confrontation
I mean I don't know if he thought he had
an option but I I just I sort of like
the fact that he manned up and he was
going to do what he could but in 82
obviously he was limited to his
abilities now I would like to say
something that is
um
maybe uncharacteristically positive
about the internet
I thought that the social media
was unusually respectful
to the Pelosi's yesterday and I enjoyed
that I enjoyed that because I expected
worse
now of course there was the usual amount
of 4chan stuff and but there weren't as
many memes as I would thought there
weren't as many you know ugly jokes
but there were jokes there were jokes
and I would like to uh you know maybe
boost that show of respect I do think
that the the world showed to him there's
some respect and given the the division
in our politics
I don't know I I was a little bit
inspired by it actually I mean I it's a
huge tragedy I really hate that that
happened to anybody
to anybody
but I feel like the Public's
reaction to it was
not horrifying
and I was surprised actually impressed
that said
has enough time going by that I can make
some jokes about this
everybody okay here's the way I'm going
to do it
I'm going to tell you about somebody
else's joke about it
okay
because if I tell you somebody else's
joke about it I'm just reporting about
these terrible people these trolls on
the internet and that's fair I can
certainly report about those damn trolls
so this is not funny
but it's things those damn trolls are
saying
apparently both men who were discovered
in their underpants at 2 30 in the
morning
and of course the fortune trolls are
wondering if this was a grinder hookup
that went wrong
now
I just saw your user jail said it looks
like a grinder hookup going bad
I think I laughed for 10 minutes
okay talk about a grinder hookup going
bad that's about as bad as you could go
because you can imagine what that would
look like
you know Paul Pelosi is saying he's 29
years old and you show up and he's 82.
like classic classic grinder I'm
guessing I'm not on grinder
and you can imagine that the the other
guy shows up and suddenly there's a
hammer involved and it's just a grinding
grinder day going bad now
joking aside
the the the reason that both men were in
their underwear is one is a famous
nudist so he's always in his underwear
and the other one was awakened at 2 30
in the morning so there is a good reason
both men were in their underwear that's
fully explained within a grinder account
okay but it was still funny it was so
funny all with all respect right with
all respect to the Pelosi's it's still
kind of funny
uh likewise uh some people on the
internet probably more than one pointed
out this wasn't the first time that Paul
Pelosi had been hammered
poor taste
poor taste I disavow these trolls who
made that clever pun
it was a second time he's been hammered
this year
all right let's talk about some more
persuasion Obama
trying to wade into the uh situation the
election with Herschel Walker
and Obama said this and we will grade
this for persuasion Obama says some of
you uh well let's see if I could do an
Obama impression some of you uh may not
uh are
uh uh
uh some of you may not are
remember but Herschel Walker was a heck
of a football player
does that make him the best person to
represent you
let's say you're at the airport and you
see a walker and you say hey there's
Herschel there's Herschel High has been
winner let's have him fly the plane
we will now grade him on his Persuasion
don't grade me on my my
on my my performance that was bad
all right what do you think of that
point just because Herschel Walker was a
Heisman winner that doesn't make him a
politician and just because he's a
Heisman winner doesn't mean he can fly a
plane
and what did people say about that they
said
uh
your your analogy is no good
because the person he's running against
can't fly a plane
no
no that's not how analogies work
no that's not how analogies work and
other people said no that doesn't work
because Obama himself doesn't know how
to fly a plane
no no that's not how analogies work
an analogy
is not about all the things being the
same
an analogy is about one narrow point and
the narrow point being
if you're an expert in one thing it
doesn't necessarily make you an expert
at another thing that's it
it does not matter if Obama can fly a
plane
right not the point not the point
anyway as soon as an analogy enters
everybody goes nuts and
but
um I liked it because it was Visual and
you could feel it
did I tell you that the greatest
persuasion is fear
and following that the greatest
Precision persuasion is usually uh
visual persuasion
so here Obama managed to get some visual
because you imagine yourself walking up
to Walker in the airport right
don't you imagine it when he describes
that you put yourself in the airport oh
there's virtual Walker in the airport
now you're seeing him and then you
imagine him with a pilot outfit looking
like John Travolta right right like a
little out of place and uh and then you
imagine yourself on a plane
and you imagine that an unqualified
pilot is flying it and you're like oh
I'm afraid so somehow Obama managed to
work fear and visual into it
but because he made it an analogy
everybody blew up on the analogy and it
didn't work
you know I was gonna I was gonna grade
uh Obama High
for the visual and for the fact they
work some fear in there in a clever way
but but when you see that it's an
analogy and the the public can't handle
analogies they just argue the details
which is completely missing the point
I guess I I guess I'd say it didn't work
it was a hell of a try
um
yeah
[Applause]
all right
was there anything that happened in the
actual news that didn't have anything to
do with
Twitter or
your personal life
now now do Herschel brain surgeon yeah
yeah so somebody says you know
confedermen fly the plane
the point is
now how many of you actually literally
don't understand the point
is that being good at one thing doesn't
make you automatically good at another
thing does anybody not know that's the
point and if you understand that is the
point why would you argue about whether
fetterman could fly a plane
what's that got to do with anything
fetterman is a politician looking for a
job as another politician
that's a little bit closer
than a Heisman Trophy winner trying to
become a senator
right mayor to Senator it's a rage
but at least it's you know the same
domain
and by the way that doesn't mean that
Herschel Walker wouldn't be a good
Senator I don't have an opinion on that
um
gave an example from the movie what
okay
um do you believe that success is a
transferable skill
how many of you believe that being
successful at one thing
let's say uh
successful in the film industry
is that uh does that extend to other
domains
it depends yeah it depends
Mark Wahlberg
got famous and he's a great example so
Mark Wahlberg gets famous as singing
with I believe no real musical
background am I right
he was part of a group right Mark
Wahlberg became famous singing without
musical experience really
then he became an actor without acting
experience
and he succeeded again right he has now
started uh
several I don't know how many maybe six
or so
companies that have nothing to do with
being an actor or a singer like one is
Wahlburgers he's an investor in that
they make burgers and several other
businesses now I don't know how
successful they are but he seems to be
somebody who can manage business
as well as singing as well as acting
with no experience in any of those
things
no experience in any of the things he's
succeeding
right
so is yeah and then yay would be another
example although you know the latest
last few weeks would disprove it but you
know it's a long game so we'll see how
he does but yay another example success
in music that he becomes a producer well
okay they're sort of related but then
suddenly he's making clothing and stuff
totally unrelated
yeah Elon the success in a variety of
things that although you could argue
that being an entrepreneur
you know a startup person is a skill
that is transferable for sure
uh Trump yeah succeeded across now
Trump's uh interesting case because he
has a tremendous amount of like failed
failed things
but if your strategy is to just keep
doing a lot of stuff and if any of them
work you know you become a billionaire
president then that's a pretty good
strategy so you wouldn't you wouldn't
rank Trump on the percentage of things
he got right you would rank him on the
overall strategy of trying a bunch of
stuff
that all have a huge upside
yeah a shack Shack's a great example
Shaq is now you know doing TV commentary
very well
and I believe he's got a number of
people who've started you know uh
Shaq was actually in my town
it was like walking distance down there
because I walk it all the time he was in
the restaurant I eat at it all the time
he was he was selling his liquor there
had an event
yeah if you look around you'll see that
the most famous people
um
Stallone is a great example
Stallone blows me away with his talent
stack
here's something you don't know about
Sylvester Stallone I might have the
story a little bit wrong but this is
approximately right the first Rocky
he wrote
let me say that again he wrote that
before he was ever an actor
or a famous actor he wrote it and then
he uh he I think he was offered like
four hundred thousand dollars for it
back when that would be worth I don't
know maybe two million dollars in
today's money and he was broke
he was offered two million dollars for
like a photocopy of a thing he wrote
and he turned it down because he wanted
to act in it
and then he got his way
so he's he's acted produced you know
he's basically done everything you can
do in the movie business right
and here's what blew me away
he has an Instagram account
now wouldn't you expect that somebody
he's in his 70s right
can you confirm is how old is
Sylvester's in the 70s he was in his 70s
he has one of the best Instagram
accounts
do you know why
because he understands it
he understands it he really understands
Instagram I love his account he's one of
the best fellows and he gets on there
and he just does little Stallone things
around the house he's got three
beautiful adult daughters who look like
supermodels and he puts them in there
all the time because he knows what sells
right it's family but he knows they're
also unusually attractive
right
yeah I just love Stallone Sloan has a
sense of humor I mean he has basically
every single
everything that you need telling for you
as every one of them covered it's quite
impressive Ryan Reynolds is another
we'll see how he does he's Ryan Reynolds
has taken on some businesses
that if I had to bet on them I'd bet
against them
but he's bringing a huge asset to them
like he bought it he's buying a soccer
team you haven't heard of
and he's got some alcohol thing that I
haven't heard of he's got mint mobile
that I don't understand how they can
compete against the big ones
I don't understand it I'm not saying
they can't I just don't understand how
that works
does anybody understand how mint mobile
can even offer a product if they'd like
what's a virtual Network
they buy access time on existing
Networks
yeah I don't really understand that
all right
is a reseller but it doesn't seem like a
reseller could get that big if they're
just reselling excess capacity
uh anyway I don't understand it but I'm
sure it's a good idea
all right
um any other story that
oh Ryan Reynolds divorced
no
that's not true isn't
did Ryan Reynolds divorce
with uh Blake whatever that's not true
is it
I don't I don't think that's true I I
thought they were one of the more
successful marriages
yeah now let's let's not say that about
him
you know if Ryan Reynolds can't stay
married
uh who can oh Tom yeah Tom Brady got
divorced
yeah
um Arnold Arnold Schwarzenegger there's
a talent stack guy you can see why
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Stallone get
along
because they're both Geniuses that
people don't recognize as genius
it's because their genius is distributed
against multiple domains
and if you have genius in one thing like
you know golf or physics everybody says
hey you're Einstein or you're you know
your Tiger Woods but if you're like a
really really seriously good at a whole
bunch of things people just say well you
got a good career
but I would say that both Stallone and
uh and Schwarzenegger in my view of
things they qualify as Jesus
because you can't get that much skill
added up across so many different
domains yeah the Rock The Rock's got a
lot of skill
uh Scott why would Paul Pelosi call the
attacker his friend to police
because the the attacker was insane
and he may have been just managing the
situation right so if you call him a
friend maybe you
maybe you get them to be less violent
for a moment I don't know I can imagine
any number of possibilities
I would say there's zero credibility to
the
you know the fact that it was anything
but a break-in I mean I don't think that
Paul Pelosi broke his own window
to make it look like it was a break-in
do you
do you think he did that you did have a
hammer in his on the other hand he did
have a hammer in his hand so
you did have a hammer
no they did not both have hammers that
confusion was cleared up only Pelosi Had
A Hammer but the other guy pulled it out
of his hand and then beat him with it so
there was so we believed there was one
hammer
uh you're thinking drug related well
it's Insanity for sure
all right
I think it's about time for me to go eat
a bagel
um
uh long guitars investment what
is there any big story I'm missing
uh what's the latest in Ukraine
so
correct me if I'm wrong won't the
Russian soldiers be freezing too
why do we keep saying that only the
ukrainians are going to be freezing
I feel like the Russian military is
going to be pretty cold
so we're already seeing uh there's an
article on the front of CNN
about uh
military losing the will to live or also
will to live the will to fight
uh
why is this
computer problem
all right
Russia has more energy assets but you
have to get them but you have to get
them to the front right and the problem
is their supply lines are being cut
bagels are bad for me
well compared to some things maybe
if all you have is a hammer everything
looks like a nail
oh that's terrible
um
yeah
you you think most Russians have never
been in a hostile environment
what I'm pretty sure every Russian has
been in a hostile weather environment
oh let me tell you about a tip that I
heard the other day that I'm I'm testing
all right now here's here's a uh a
lifestyle tip that I think you should
take to heart
uh it has to do with continuous a b
testing for your main things so your
main three things would be diet exercise
and sleep
all right if you get diet exercises to
sleep right then everything else is
going to work out better for you so I'm
continually experimenting with better
ways to you know eat and better ways to
exercise better ways to sleep I saw this
tip from some alleged expert on social
media and I wondered if you'd heard it
before
and I wondered if you tried it so I
tried it for the last two nights
and it worked exactly as the expert
predicted
but it's only two nights so I have to do
it more and it goes like this that if
you eat within three hours of going to
bed you won't sleep well
have you ever heard that
that has to do with having carbs in your
system you don't sleep well with carbs
so you have heard that so
um the night before last
I tested that so I made sure that I was
done eating I didn't eat anything after
6 30 at night
and I had the best sleep that I've had
in weeks
so then the next day because my schedule
got ahead of me I couldn't do that so I
ate dinner closer to 8 30 or 9 o'clock
at night and then I tried unsuccessfully
to go to bed like an hour and a half
later
and had a terrible night's sleep
so I've tried it twice and so far it's a
hundred percent
that when I ate was completely
predictive and here's the weird thing
that one good night of sleep is the
first one
and I never
don't eat for three hours before bed
like I'm generally snacking all night
that often the last thing I do before
going to bed because I don't like to be
hungry
like that wakes me up to so often the
last thing I do before I go to pet is
eat
do you do that
all right so here's what I'm gonna do
I'm not claiming this works
because I don't know
what I'm claiming is is really smart to
test everything that's easy to test with
an emphasis on easy to test right this
is one of the best life advices you'll
ever get
continually test in the domains of
exercise
sleep and diet never stop test test test
test test
but always test the things that are easy
to test but could have a big impact
first you don't want to test the big
things like the I I'm not sure I would
oh I don't know
I I guess something like going on a fast
for one day
seems like that's small enough you could
test that not much of a downside
so you saw when I did my
tried to solve my own medical problems
I filled my whiteboard with all the
things it could be and some of them were
tough stuff like endocrine endocrine
problem
if it's an endocrine problem uh you know
it's going to be testing and doctors and
trying drugs and God knows what right
but of all the things that I wrote down
that it might be
one of the possibilities was my blood
pressure meds were the problem
now it turns out that was the easiest
thing to test
because I simply just skipped taking
them for one day
which I knew was safe enough I
researched that if you miss it for one
day that's not a risk right it is a risk
if you take if you skip it for let's say
more than one day
I don't know how much the risk ramps up
but if you go a week I'm I'm told
there's a bounce back effect and I don't
know how dangerous that would be
um
oh I'm going to go somewhere really
dangerous here in a moment
I'm going to switch gears
let me tell you something I did
yesterday
that blew my mind
and I need some help I'm going to ask
the internet brain the the collective
intelligence to help me out because I
sort of reached a cap of what I can do
on my own
when I decided to experiment by stopping
my blood pressure meds
the first thing I wondered is whether
it's dangerous right is it dangerous to
skip skip uh one day I figured no
but I didn't know how long I could go
before it was dangerous
so I looked it up
and uh I didn't get a clean answer but
then I thought well my my blood pressure
is not super high
you know down to like 130 over 84 or
something
and I thought to myself
okay is that dangerous
do it do we know the science says for
sure
that for the average person
that being a little bit High 134 over
let's say 84. is that going to be
dangerous and so here's what I did I
Googled it
now if you Google that don't you think
you're going to get an obviously clean
clear answer
yes or no do you think that the science
of blood pressure and blood pressure
medication
is settled to the point where if I ask
it what blood pressure should be treated
there'll be a clean clear answer with a
consensus
let me tell you what my experience was
so I Googled it and I found a research
that looked at other research
and it went through you know what
everybody says about what's dangerous
and what's not and then I can since I
couldn't understand all the science I do
what I always do I skip to the
conclusion
so this is not what it actually said I'm
going to make this part up but this is
how it felt
this study says this this study says
this this study says this
so and this and then the conclusion said
this is the national guideline what I
was looking at was an Australian study
so and then the conclusion was here's
the Australian guideline
do you see what's missing
they never connected the research to the
guideline
they they showed the research and then
they said here's the guideline and and
nowhere there that they say directly
This research supports the guideline
because you know what it didn't
it didn't it didn't disavow the
guideline but it also didn't support it
and so instead of just saying that
directly
it just changed the subject
and so I read another one I thought well
that's weird
so I read another one and sure enough it
like blah blah blah this is what the
science says and then the conclusion was
Merry Christmas now it didn't say Merry
Christmas I'm making that up
but what it didn't say is something
related to what I just read that
the science
and
and so I ask you this question
is blood pressure medication
now let me be very clear I'm positive
that for some people it keeps them alive
can we all agree on that
I'm positive
I'm not a doctor but I'm positive
there's some people in some situations
that it must keep them alive I think my
father might have been one of those
actually
yeah some people say it saved your life
Etc so I think so but let me ask you
this do you think science can tell me
specifically
I'm at my ideal BMI
I am a pescetarian for decades or
vegetarian pescatarian
I don't drink alcohol I don't smoke
tobacco
do you think that a science knows
whether I should take blood pressure
medication what do you think
I think there's a guideline and I think
they told me I should
and I think if I asked a hundred times
they'd say yes
I think if I asked 100 doctors 100
doctors would say yes
but do you think the science supports it
because if it does support it can you
show me where that is
because I looked and I didn't see it
is that is that missing for a reason
so here's here's why I think this is
um
important
um what happened when I took blood
pressure medications the first thing I
did was I didn't want to exercise
you got that the first thing I did on
blood pressure medications is I didn't
want to exercise so I did less
I I tried to push through as hard as I
can because I'm pretty stubborn but it
was still less
do you know what else I felt I felt I
didn't want to live
and that was just the medication as soon
as I was off at Boone went away
it made me not want to live
what is the life expectancy of people
who don't want to live and can't
exercise and can't enjoy life
and their libido you know takes a hit
are you telling me those blood pressure
medications aren't killing people
because I just described something that
does kill people
you know if if you gave a pill to
somebody who was otherwise perfectly
healthy and the only changes it made is
it made them not want to exercise gain
weight easily not care about living lose
their libido you tell me that person
isn't going to die sooner
I think they'll die sooner because I
don't give a about living
I didn't I honestly didn't care about
living
and I don't mean there's no hyperbole
there
when I was on that drug I had no
interest in being alive none none now
fortunately my executive function of my
brain was still intact and the executive
function told me to wait it out right so
I was overriding my all the rest of my
brain with my executive function but
just barely
just barely right
and I'm not sure if everybody could do
that right I'm I'm sort of unusually
mentally strong I like to think that's
probably just my own illusion
if you can skip the meds for a day you
didn't get better in one day
I don't know what that means exactly
yeah everybody's different so starting
with the everybody's different Theory
do you think that I personally am in
danger
um
more in danger or let's say this exact
case your blood pressure is 134 over 84
which is high you'd want it 120 over one
you want it 120 over 80. so it is high
but it's not super high
it's just high-ish
you tell me that
for sure that's better than taking a
pill that removes my will to live
it's not even close is it
let me be clear if so I haven't tried
all blood pressure medications I'll
probably I'm going to experiment to see
what I can do without it for a little
while but probably
probably I'll go back and maybe try
something that I think has less
deleterious effects
but here's the other scary part
I went months without knowing it was the
blood pressure meds do you know what I
thought it was
all right all right here's here's
another learning point
let me teach you something
when I went public and said that I'd uh
that I had extreme fatigue everyone who
had a pet peeve or a pet Theory told me
they were sure what caused it right
so the people who thought long covered
was real said oh you definitely got long
covered I've got that too the people who
love vaccinations injured people said
well that's a clear example of a
vaccination injury no doubt about it
Scott that's what you got the people who
thought vegetarian diets are bad for you
and Rob your strength they said eat some
meat damn it that's all you need to do
eat some beef you'll be better
the
um the people who think that
testosterone may have helped them
said it's obvious that your low
testosterone Scott get your get your
testosterone tested
now
right many of you are guilty now people
had all kinds of theories but here's
what you should learn
they were all pretty damn certain that
they were right
just as certain they are that their
neighbor who died died of a vax injury
just as certain they are of everything
else that's not true
all right we can we get really certain
of things that aren't true really fast
yeah and I appreciate by the way I
appreciate the suggestions that's not a
complaint I do appreciate the the
suggestions
um so somebody's suggesting here that I
should try different blood pressure meds
to see which ones give me side effects
and here's the problem
I thought I was doing that
that's what I thought I was doing and it
almost killed me
I didn't know that the blood pressure
meds were the cause of the way I felt
because it doesn't happen the day you
take it
it must build up
because on day one I didn't have any of
those problems it was you know you just
got more and more and more somebody says
low carbs everybody has their own Theory
but all of your theories are wrong if I
miss one pill by one day and all of my
problems are solved
so now it's been several days I don't
know a week or something so it's been
several days and these are the only
several days of good life I've had in in
a long time
somebody says it's all in your head
that's not even that's not even slightly
possible you you'd have to you'd have to
know from the inside how dramatic the
difference is
the differences between not being able
to walk up the stairs
and spontaneously skipping
completely different like spontaneously
I think I'll just skip from this room to
this room and then there's no comparison
right that was not in my head
definitely not in my head
low carbs I'm generally a low carb guy
I'm lower carbs than most people
I am sort of fish and vegetable kind of
a guy
all right that's all for now I'm gonna
say goodbye to YouTube for now and I'll
talk to you tomorrow
