hey everybody
come on in it's time for coffee with
scott adams best time of day
every single time what do you need
well you need a copper mug a glass of
tango chelsea stein a canteen jugger
flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes
everything better except
audits of election software
it happens now go
oh so good
so good well rasmussen did a poll
i think you'll see it in a little bit
later today
in which they determined that when
citizens are asked
who the biggest enemy is
each other or china or russia
turns out that we're more afraid of each
other
than other countries
so democrats are more afraid of trump
supporters than they are of
foreign adversaries and vice versa
now what's that tell you
well the first thing it tells you is
that that kind of
a a survey isn't exactly apples and
oranges right
so if china attacks you you get
destroyed in a giant
fireball of nuclear nuclear fury
if a democrat or a republican get mad at
you
you might get canceled so they're not
they're not quite equal but it's very
interesting just to see sort of the
the mood of the country we we have been
convinced
to turn against each other now
there's kind of a good news part of that
isn't there
if the thing i'm if the thing you're
most worried about
is literally your neighbor
and not china and not
russia didn't president trump do a good
job
think about it because the the survey is
not
just telling us that we're worried about
each other
in the country it's also telling us that
we're
not as worried about risks of other
countries
which is good news because i'd i would
much rather be
you know arguing about who's a racist
and who's not and who won the election
then i would be you know hiding in my
bunker and waiting for the
chinese air force to go over
so i don't know if that's bad or not but
it's interesting
uh here's my big point for the day
all right so i'm going to make one big
point
and then we're going to talk about lots
of little points but none of the little
points
if you added them all together will
equal this one point
it doesn't even get close and here's the
one point
i don't mind that dominion has said we
can't audit their systems
because they say it's proprietary
software and therefore we can't look at
them
i don't mind as long as
you know that the the alternative to
auditing your
election software there's only one
alternative which is to throw out the
entire election
now that's what you would do if you were
let's say a corporation
let's say you were a big corporation and
you had found that some important
process
had run and you can't tell
if the outcome was real or not real
because and there's no way to check
if you were a corporate ceo and your
system had produced you
an outcome doesn't matter what the
system is it produces an outcome
that you can't tell you know that people
had a
motive to fake it you know they had the
opportunity to fake it
and you can't check to see if they did
fake it what would you do with that data
well you wouldn't use it right
you wouldn't use that data no but no
head of a corporation would use data
that's probably faked
because there's the motive and the
opportunity and you can't check
there's no way to check it's that simple
now if you tell me scott scott scott
we've had this software for years we
can't throw out
all our past elections i'm not saying
that
our past elections are the past can't
change the past
but a hundred percent of people
who are familiar with software will
agree with me
there are very three things that you can
get a hundred percent of people to agree
with but a hundred percent of people who
understand
software will agree that if we can't
audit
the election system wait for it
we don't even know if an election
happened
because what is the definition of an
election the definition of election is
people vote the votes are counted
and then whoever wins there's some
outcome from that
right that i think you'd all agree
that's the definition
of what voting is the people do the
process of voting
you count them then you change whatever
you're gonna change because of the
outcome
did that happen we don't know
we don't know we actually don't know we
know people
attempted to vote so we definitely have
that part
and we we know that something's going to
change
so we've got that part but there's this
whole middle part
where we don't know if the thing that
people did
the voting had any correlation
with the outcome do you know
i mean you have an opinion and i have an
opinion
but we don't know now i'm not talking
about the kind of
knowing like you know a philosophical
knowing it's like
can we know we are really alive
no i'm not talking about philosophically
knowing
i'm talking about the practical kind of
knowing
the the kind where you organize your
life
around things you're fairly sure of but
you don't know
like i don't know that if i get in my
car
it won't blow up
but i'm confident that it won't so i'll
get in my car anyway
so the point is if you're arguing about
whether the election was fair or not
fair you're thinking past the sale
back up a little bit you don't know if
an election happened
right so if you're talking about whether
the outcome is fair or not fair
you've already thought past the question
was there an election
because i'm not aware of one i'm aware
of people voting
i'm aware that there's a president-elect
at least you know
in terms of the public opinion i'm not
aware that there was any counting of
votes
in which the votes translated into the
outcome i'm not aware of that
are you of course not because
the system that counted them says you
can't audit them
and somebody said that they don't even
keep audit logs i don't know if that's
true
but if somebody bought a system
well let's back up a little and just
appreciate the following statements
so it's been said that in georgia the
republican governor
and secretary of state is it both
republicans
or were and that they're the ones who
brought this dominion software in which
means
that they being in charge they didn't
make the detailed decisions
but whoever whoever did that for them
decided to sign an election system
contract without the right to audit the
software
do you know how big of a mistake that is
i don't know even how to put that on a
scale
the the size of that mistake
that's like legendary that that's not
guy in cubicle forgets to
check a box right
that's a mistake that's as big as the
biggest mistake that's ever been made in
the history of the world
that's beyond the biggest mistake
now i see some skeptics in the comments
saying
well maybe it wasn't a mistake how do
you know it was a mistake
maybe they intentionally created a
situation
in which uh nothing could be found
but remember they were republicans
the republicans definitely did not
intentionally
pick a system that would keep
republicans out of office
they didn't intentionally do that they
may have
you know their allegations that they
took money or whatever i don't know
anything about that
but certainly i haven't seen evidence
to back up any of those claims but
we've got a really bad situation here
somebody says trump lost
that's so cute
here's here's something that's a head
scratcher
did trump run the cleanest election of
all time
because it's getting just weird
that democrats are not blaming
either a foreign country or
republicans of also cheating in the
election
really really this is the first election
where there was no outside interference
and by the way
as we learned in 2016 outside
interference
by the mighty russian intelligence
agencies
means creating three bad memes and
putting them on facebook
so we're talking about a very low bar
to how hard it is to interfere with our
election
how hard would it be to create a meme
and disguise its origin well that would
be pretty easy
pretty darn easy so we're not even
talking about it
it was the biggest problem in the world
four years ago
nothing's changed because
there's nothing that changed that would
prevent
russia from creating a meme we're
talking about
memes we're not talking about hacking
what would stop them from creating a
meme
nothing they could obviously plant memes
without
without showing the source there's
obviously a way to do that
so the fact that none of that is
happening
is just head shaking and here's what i
think i think that even democrats
at this point realize the election was
not
uh credible now because it wasn't
credible i don't know who won
or would have won if it had been fair
but
certainly i feel as if you know the
survey said 30
of democrats think it was rigged but i
think it's closer to 100
think that there was at least a tempted
mischief
probably 70 percent have
wishful thinking that there wasn't
enough of it to change the outcome
because they don't want that to be true
but i don't believe there are any
democrats
who could have heard the pennsylvania
and then yesterday the arizona hearings
and just hear the accusations if you
just hear the accusations you don't even
need to know if any of them are true
because what the accusations taught you
is that whether or not there were real
instances of fraud
there were plenty of opportunities right
it can we all agree that in the last
week
we've moved from serious people
saying completely straight-faced
there wasn't any way to cheat that much
it would have been obvious
nobody could cheat that much without it
being so obvious that they'd get caught
it's not really possible do you think
anybody believes that this week
it's really possible in fact i thought
it was possible before
but i was sort of operating on the the
thought that
well maybe i don't know how to cheat but
people who are really putting time and
attention into it
they've probably figured it out by now
turns out it's so easy to cheat
in a million different ways so long as
you can control the witnessing
and the auditing which is the case the
democrats and democrat-controlled cities
did control the witnessing and there's
no audit
of the software company of the software
and there's probably no useful audit of
the
paper ballots because the envelopes were
separated
so was there an election
i don't know um
there's a report i saw just before i got
on here
that i'm really really skeptical about
but i'll just put it out there so this
is an alleged
story don't put this in the same bucket
as
things you know to be true but allegedly
the sec has filed something
uh about dominion voting systems
and there's some there is a uh
there's an allegation that is partly
owned by china
now partly owned meaning that
uh there's an investment company that's
owned by somebody who's owned by china
so that china would be the the end of a
chain of ownership
or partial ownership for some of the
dominion machines
now do you think that's possible
that uh that dominion got a 400 million
dollar investment
from a bank in switzerland that is 75
owned by a chinese government by the
chinese government
do you think that's true
now if it if it is true it doesn't
necessarily mean that you know
you found some kind of a smoking gun
because you could have
people investing in lots of stuff and
the investors may not have that much
you know control over it but
certainly raises an eyebrow doesn't it
i mean it has the look of an attempt
to influence things even if they
couldn't i don't know if they could
just by investing in it but it sure
looks like an attempt
if we can't find any direct evidence
that the election was rigged
i think we will but if let's say we
can't audit it
and we just can't we just can't get at
the information
is there anything we can do short of
being able to audit it
that would tell us at least for our own
information
whether or not the the thing was stolen
and i propose an experiment
so i think you could do an experiment
that would tell you with a fair
fairly high degree of certainty whether
or not the election was stolen
now i wouldn't tell you who really won
you know or what the amount was but it
would tell you if there was massive
fraud
so let's say not stolen but let's say a
test that would tell you
if there were massive fraud or not
in the election here's the test you find
a remote
desert area in utah
and then you build an obelisk really
cool looking metal obelisk
but don't make it so big that a couple
of big guys couldn't pick it up and put
it on a truck
you want to make it small enough
that somebody could steal it if they
were inclined to do it
now here's the second part you you
introduce this obelisk into the news
turning it from a simple metal object
that looks kind of cool
into a famous object
and when something is famous let's say
the mona lisa or the
liberty bell or whatever fame adds value
right because if you had a famous
painting
it would be worth a lot even if it's not
as good
as less famous paintings so you'd have
this obelisk
in the desert just hypothetically i'm
not saying you'd do this
but put it in the desert and then just
leave it unguarded
after you've told the world that this
valuable
unguarded item is in the utah desert
and then you just wait wait about a
month and see if it's still there
now if it's still there what your test
has shown you
is that even when millions of humans
know about an unguarded valuable object
that they can go just get then none of
them did it
now if that's your situation where
millions of people can know they can
just go
steal this thing of value and they don't
you've got yourself a good election
because the thing we've proven
is that there are lots of ways you could
have stolen the election
it's just hard to know if it happened or
not but
if human nature can be let's say studied
to the degree that you know that in some
situations humans will always act the
same way
well that's not enough for a court it's
not enough for science
that's enough for you
so i hope somebody does that experiment
and puts a cool-looking obelisk in a
utah desert
and we'll see if it disappears we'll see
and then you'll know if your election
was stolen or at least attempted
how impressed are you at the
two movie situation we're having do you
remember when i first started talking
about oh there's two movies running on
one screen
and the democrats and republicans are
seeing different worlds
and you said to yourself yeah that's
that's like sort of i can almost see
what you're talking about there
you know kind of conceptually a little
bit i i can see we're seeing different
stuff
but did you ever think you would get to
this point today
where the following two statements are
both presented as 100 percent true
republicans say there is a ton of
evidence
that the election was stolen right
lots of republicans say that at the same
time
just go on twitter you can see that tons
of democrats
say there is zero evidence
not that the evidence has been debunked
well they do say that but they're
they're saying that the justice isn't
any
and the republicans are saying uh i'm
drowning in it
so it's a little like you know what it
feels like
is that it's two people standing in the
ocean up to their neck
and one looks at the other and says
there's no water
here and the other looks over and says
you're up to your neck and water there's
nothing but water
we are completely in water and the other
one up to the neck looks over and says
no we're not that's the world we're in
now if you think that this is like
blowing your mind because you never
thought this could be possible
then you've never been a hypnotist
because hypnotists
know this is completely possible in fact
normal
it would be weirder if we didn't get to
this point it was completely predictable
and so when i predicted that we would
have two presidents
one who actually gets the job and one
that
half the country says yeah that really
was the one who got elected was the
other guy
did that seem real when i first said it
before the election
remember i said that before the election
did that seem like that was going to
happen
it happened here we are we do have two
presidents
in the minds of the public
all right project veritas
somehow got the phone number for a cnn
uh some kind of a conference call
in which jeff zucker was talking to his
cnn staff about
cnn and apparently project veritas will
be
releasing these audio clips so that we
can see what cnn
says to each other when they don't think
other people are listening
and then james o'keefe who was on the
call
he live streamed himself on the call uh
he uh he asks a question and then
when zucker realizes that he's on a call
with a project
veritas veritas leader
he says uh maybe we should end this call
and
find some different technology to talk
on
so wait for that
name any problem in this country that is
not made worse by the teachers unions
there's a challenge for you name any any
uh
domestic problem that isn't worsened
by the teachers unions and it's one of
those things when you first hear it you
think
well not everything i mean there must be
some problems
that are not made worse by the teachers
unions but if you imagine that the
teachers unions are destroying
education then it ripples through
everything
our science is bad you know our
understanding of logic
and facts our ability to get jobs
racism and income inequality
even the ability to pay back a student
student loan
right yeah just about everything
is it can be traced back to the teachers
unions being the
the biggest enemy in the country um
a funny thing happened today the
president retweeted an account
from cat turd that became a big trending
thing
and it had more to do with the fact that
cat turd spelled exactly like
a cat turd got retweeted by the
president
aren't we going to miss that could you
ever imagine
a president joe biden retweeting
cat turd it doesn't matter what cat turd
said
can you imagine a joe biden retweeting
it no you can't
you just can't so we're going to miss
that i
did a little twitter unscientific survey
and i said
since the beginning of the pandemic has
your relationship with your spouse
gotten better worse of the same and the
results were
interesting you know of course
non-scientific but
uh 40 percent said their relationships
got better
during the pandemic and i believe that
because i think if
the if the spouses get along
and they're forced to spend more time
together they can't you know drive to
work whatever
then it's just more of something they
wanted they already liked
spending time with each other and they
got a little extra so 40
of them said it's better 45 said it's
about the same
good and 15 percent said worse
so those are the people who probably
were doing well when they didn't spend
much time with each other
and when they had to spend time it was
uh it's not so good
but this is actually better than i
thought i thought it was going to be
more
uh more gloomy than this now of course
people might be lying because there's
you know who knows how honest they were
here's a new story that's uh
foreshadowing
more to come uh apparently ten local
chapters of black lives matter
issued a statement that they there's not
enough financial disclosure from the
the national leadership they don't have
accountability and transparency
in the massive amount of money that
they've collected
so black lives matter at the national
level
especially with the george floyd stuff
they collected massive amounts of money
and the local chapters are saying uh
could we see a statement about that and
could you share a little bit with us and
where's that money going
now who knows if this is a little
problem or a big one
but here's the main point what if black
lives matter loses his boogeyman
because don't you think trump was the
reason that black lives matter could be
so popular
despite doing so many things that you
would imagine would make you
unpopular such as destroying businesses
and whatnot
so i feel as though when trump
if you imagine that trump does not have
a second term
black lives matter is probably going to
turn on each other
because they would lose their external
you know boogeyman to
to focus on i would also expect black
lives matter and antifa
to end up turning on each other same
reason
because they they lost their common
enemy all right
uh
um so quite a few election
claims have been debunked but i wanted
to read you this list of
uh election anomalies because a lot of
this will
turn on the anomaly part but here's the
problem
anywhere you see a list of of data
anomalies
i guarantee you that some of these are
not true
guaranteed so what happens when you have
a list of
i don't know it looks like 17 or 20
different things that are data anomalies
and it's really easy for the critics to
say
ah here's three of them that aren't true
all right i'm gonna delete whoever said
scott is a sophist
because you're not even trying
to put user and timeout
um so it really hurts your argument
if you put some fake stuff on a list
with stuff that's not
fake but let's let me run through these
and in the
in the comments uh do some fact checking
okay
so i'll read the claims and then you can
fact check me
so my claim is that these are not true
are you ready all right so i'm going to
read you things that my claim is
are not true meaning that the entire
list is an 100
true there are definitely some things on
here i think
that are true but don't believe them
all right so there's nothing on the list
that just by its nature
you should say oh that's true so stay
stay
skeptical on this list all right here it
is
uh for nearly 150 years every president
who has gained
votes in a re-election campaign has also
won
the re-election is that meaningful
that whenever a president has gained
votes in a re-election
they also won re-election i would say
that is not
meaningful because the population
increased
and because trump never had a primary
uh challenge um
and it was such a polarizing uh
kind of a thing it was just high turnout
right so i think all that's saying is
there was high turnout
does that tell you anything not really
all right so the first one
might be true but it's not really
telling you much
because of the special case that people
wanted to turn out
said trump gained 11 million more votes
than 2016
but biden somehow overcame those odds
again
i don't know if it's true or not the
number but let's say it's true
would that tell you anything about
whether or not there was fraud
nope nope so the first two
may or may not be true but they
certainly don't tell you there's fraud
it just tells you that a lot of people
voted right so that's all you know so
far
number three trump won the highest share
of minority voters for a gop
candidate since 1960. i believe that's
true
and that one's now we're starting to get
into some better stuff here right
because if he won a high share of
minority voters
and yet the the very reason he lost is
because he got an unusually
low share of minority voters in key
cities
that's kind of a red flag isn't it it's
a bit of a flag
doesn't mean it it's not proof but
certainly makes you scratch your head
uh then related to the same thing this
is just another point
that trump grew his support among black
voters by 50 percent
again it's the same point but just
another way to look at it
biden's support among black voters fell
below 90 percent
the level below which democratic
presidential candidates
usually lose so if you've got
biden getting fewer black votes than
historically and trump getting more
black votes than historically
and by a significant amount trump
doubled his support
would you expect that he would lose with
that
you wouldn't expect it but again
it's not impossible it's just starting
to get
really unlikely all right how about
biden shattered the popular vote record
while winning a
record low 17 of counties
okay so that again doesn't prove
anything
but you got to ask yourself why was
he getting so many votes in general
but he got now the fact that he got lots
of votes in general just means there
were a lot of voters
so the first part of this is meaningless
there were lots of votes
but it probably does tell you something
that he
he uh he got a record low 17 percent of
counties now of course
the whole point is that it's the big
metro areas
that want it for biden so i don't know
that that's the strongest point
obama won 873 counties in 2008 well
biden only got 524
but somehow despite getting
far fewer counties obama got far
or biden got far more votes yeah every
one of these that has biden getting more
votes
in quantity is not really convincing
because the the one thing we all agree
on is that both trump
and biden got more votes than you would
expect in
other years all right how about
biden's the first one to lose ohio and
florida
in 60 years and still win and he's the
second president in 168 years
to lose ohio florida and iowa
and still win trump won 18 out of 19
bellwether counties they have a near
perfect record over the 40 years of
predicting who would win
now that's when start to get strong now
if you're going to tell me which which
asked me which of these
do you find convincing or at least
persuasive
i would say this bellwether county thing
is really stands out doesn't it
because again it's not impossible
that these numbers happened this way
naturally
but what are the odds of winning 18 out
of 19 bellwether account
when that is nearly impossible
here's one biden underperformed hillary
clinton except in the few cent
except in four cities now i've seen this
one debunked
online but i don't know if they're
debunking the actual claim or something
close to it to make it look like they
debunk the actual claim
and what i mean by close to it is if
they're counting the numbers
but not the percentage of votes they
counted the wrong thing all right
so uh did biden underperform hillary
clinton
in terms of raw votes everywhere except
those four states
probably not right i think biden beat
hillary in
raw votes in lots of places am i right
so do a fact check on me i'm kind of
guessing on this next thing
because i think when it gets debunked
they're debunking the raw number of
votes
and saying no there were plenty of
places where biden got more
raw number of votes than hillary clinton
fact check me on that but isn't the
argument the percentage
of how many went to biden versus trump i
think that's the argument
not the raw number
um republicans won across the country
but biden somehow beat trump so here
there are two points that are kind of
connected
republicans 127 and a 27
of the toss-up
contests here's maybe the hardest one to
believe
do you believe that people decided to
vote against
trump because that's how they were
talking were voting against
trump but while they were voting against
trump
they were not voting against the people
who support trump on the same ballot
the people who would be in congress
would you do that how many people are
just gonna kick
check the president box and not do the
other ones
maybe so i would say it's still possible
it's possible that lots and lots of
people
checked only the presidential box and
just didn't even vote on the other stuff
which would give you the possibility
that republicans sweep the
under the undercards and the president
just gets voted against in big numbers
in the top
it's possible anything's possible
no incumbent who has received 75 percent
of the primary vote
has ever lost reelection i would
consider that one worthless
i know it's predicted in the past but
this time we just had a candidate who
was running
you know uh running uh unchallenged
right
so what doesn't mean anything i don't
think that one's important
trump won 94 percent of the primary vote
i think all of the primary stuff
is not predictive i feel like all of the
well who won the primary before i don't
feel like that's predictive
i realize there's a correlation but i
don't know if it's predictive
um
trump set a record for most primary
votes yeah so everything that's
quantity related is unpersuasive
so there you are they're definitely some
head scratchers there but some of them
are debunked and some of them
are no big deal and
let's see if i've talked about
everything oh there's
there's a study out that says that
people who got the
measles mumps rubella vaccination
recover from kovid or practically have
no
no symptoms now it's one study
but it shows that the the difference
whether you had that
shot or didn't have that shot is
gigantic
so that we're not talking about oh we
teased out this
statistical difference we're talking
about if you had this shot
you did great if you didn't have that
shot
you were in the percentage of people who
had a bad outcome
so i'd like to see that one proven or
disproven
it could be the thing that explains
everything
because as i've told you you can't look
at
the management decisions or the
leadership decisions
in different countries and tease out
why some people got better results than
others
there is still some gigantic variable in
this whole pandemic
that we haven't we haven't isolated it
might be this
could be this vaccination thing um
you do realize that the emerging
hypothesis about the election
is that if it were if it were rigged it
were rigged in what i'll call a
packetized way
in other words little packets of fraud
each of them designed so that they're
individually not so big
that if any individual packet of fraud
got discovered
and let's say those votes were tossed
out that it wouldn't be enough to change
the election
because you're not going to find them
all and they cheated in lots of
different ways
allegedly uh in different places and you
know different
parts of the uh the process
so
if you're thinking about the election in
terms of finding that big
package of fraud i don't think you're
going to find that
because i think that what it looks like
is there won't be
the single big package of fraud unless
you count rule changes
right so you can say well they shouldn't
have made this decision
which allowed these votes to be counted
but i don't know if that's fraud fraud
that's more like politicians trying to
get away with whatever they can get away
with that's more like a rule
a rule trickery but i think the actual
fraud fraud
is going to be in packets by design
now as rudy giuliani pointed out
in the arizona hearings
that there is at least there's a tell
or at least some kind of a signal
for coordination now that has not been
demonstrated
or proven but rudy giuliani is i would
say an expert
in sniffing out uh
coordinated plots like the mafia right
so he knows something that's a
coordinated plot
versus something that's just lots of
people acting independently
and it sounds like he's he's sniffing
out some coordination here
now if it turns out that the fraud
exists
and it's packetized by design
and it's organized isn't that a pretty
big legal case
the organized part takes it up to rico
right
i think um
so dr scott atlas resigned
from the coronavirus um
advising job at the white house
that's good news for me so that i don't
keep getting confused
with dr scott atlas but i feel as though
that was probably a smart move because
he said everything he wanted to say
everybody heard it and then after that
he was just
becoming a source of criticism so i
think i think he was smart to move on it
was time
um
let's see um
so i'm just deciding what to talk about
here
um
all right i think that's all i wanted to
talk about
um and i'm going to go back to my first
point when i
when i got on here all right so we
talked about lots of different
allegations and we talked about lots of
different
data you know anomalies
beyond this list of data anomalies i
read there there's a much more
convincing
um bits of evidence so there's
there's tons of evidence of fraud
which the democrats call no evidence at
all
i haven't seen anything but i think it
comes down to this
if we have an election system which
can't be audited
because there's proprietary information
in it
that's all you need to know there's
nothing
else you have to ask to know what is the
right thing to do
the right thing to do is either
throw out the result and redo it you'd
have to redo it you couldn't just throw
out the result and put
trump in power but you can redo it
the other thing you can do is say we're
going to have to scrap the system
totally
but for the benefit of the country we're
going to let biden
take over and we'll work it out as we go
that's probably what's going to happen
probably you're going to get a
president uh biden who did i say obama
you're going to get president biden who
will
take the job and we will have to figure
out
how to redo our system for next time
because
we're definitely not going to go into
another let me make you a promise
i promise you you're not going to be
voting in 2024
on machines that don't have an audit uh
capability does anybody want to take the
opposite side of that bet
i will bet you that we're done
with unauditable election
systems we're definitely done
does anybody doubt that because if we
have another election
with unauditable software
that's a revolution because
doing it once and then sort of the
country has learned about it
now we know that there's a problem there
even if the election
wasn't rigged that non-auditable
software thing that's not something you
can live with
and so let me say this as clearly as
possible
if we're still living with it in 2024
we don't have a country anymore and then
we have to
stage a revolution all right so in 2024
the revolution is on
if we still have unauditable
software for our elections there is
there's no alternative to that
because if we still have this situation
in 2024
you can know the election is stolen
right
i'm pretty sure this one was fraudulent
but i also think well you know
it's possible people were at least
trying to make it
honest but if it's the same situation in
2024
you can say with complete certainty that
the people in charge
were not attempting not even trying
to give you a real election not even
trying
right would you agree that that would be
not even trying
and if we have a country that's not even
trying
to have real elections revolution
that's what i say and the revolution
could be simple just uh
uh destroy the election machines
let me give you a preview of 2024.
let's say 2024 happens we still have
unauditable
election machines there will be a tea
party
there will be a tea party meaning that
republicans
and i mean this literally not
figuratively we'll take control of the
facilities where those machines are
they will put them on pickup trucks
probably pick up trucks
with american flags on them and they
will drive them
to the bay
and they will throw those machines into
the
ocean and if you try to vote with them
again
and you bring them back those same
pickup trucks
will appear at your same
facilities
they will load up those trucks with your
 unauditable machines
and they will dump them in the
ocean
again this time we might have to live
with the outcome
because we don't want to you don't want
to destroy your own country you're
trying to save it right
so we might just have to do the best we
can with what we have
but in 2024 there will not be
an election with unauditable
technology we will throw that
in the ocean
that's it we will throw it in the
 ocean
you know i'm right right you know i'm
right
those machines will be physically
removed and thrown in the ocean
are you with me who's with me
i'll drive the truck i will drive the
 truck
right because that's revolution that
that's you know if we do this again
we're not around anymore right
that's
that's a bright line so i give people
plenty of flexibility to
fix things to make mistakes i'm really
big on
letting people make their mistakes and
not kill them for it right
but it wouldn't be a mistake if we let
it happen again
i would i would be willing to say if
you're
if you're a governor of a state and your
political people are buying
a software system maybe you're not good
at it
it's entirely possible that you're as a
politician
you're just not good at procuring things
and you didn't know you needed that
audit right etc
but now you know now you know
so there are no excuses for 2024
your shit's going in the ocean if you
try this again
your shit's going in the ocean that's it
we're done we are done here
let me let me tell you a uh a management
trick for your life there are times when
you say
i probably will do this or i might do
this or
you should worry that i'll do this or
there's some chance i'll do this
and then there's a good reason to say
there's a chance i might do it i might
do it
and then there are other times when you
just say it's a decision
so let me put this not in a prediction
form
let me put it in decision form because
this is different
it's one thing to predict it's a
decision
that i will personally help you throw
those machines in the ocean
if this happens again like i that's a
promise
it's a commitment i will help you
throw them in the ocean that's it so
to my government you don't have to
wonder if it's going to happen
you don't have to wonder it's a decision
we have decided that we won't put up
with it
that's very different very different
somebody says weak talk big talk from a
week old man
goodbye frank frank it was nice
removing you
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
later
all right youtubers periscope is off
somebody says now is the only option
well you know i've heard the arguments
that
if the democrats get control they'll
consolidate control and add states and
all that
but i think we have to wait for the
georgia election
if the georgia election looks reasonable
you know and and as predicted you get
two more republicans and
the senate is held i don't think that's
revolution time
i think that's fix your problem time
but there is there is a time when you
have to treat it differently in the
future
um but i don't think we're there
uh what would you do about the
fraudulent mail-in votes
well we're going to try to audit them
but i think audit will be
impossible do i think i could ever write
another thought experiment book similar
to god's debris
well god's debris has a sequel i don't
know if you know that it's called the
religion war
but it's it's a very different kind of a
book so the answer is
i'm not thinking about that because
god's debris was sort of a lifetime of
thoughts
compressed into a tiny book but yeah
you almost have to leave live a second
lifetime
to get that many thoughts that can be
put into a book
why don't the math anomalies count
they don't um they don't count because
in many cases they're just an obvious
explanation for them
there are some that don't have an
explanation and they they do count
so you can't say the anomalies count or
don't count
but you can say that most of them have
some other explanation
some of them are pretty strong
so the the anomalies i would worry about
are in the mail-in votes those are the
ones that will be the big ones
uh if the election was stolen the whole
world
loses maybe i don't know
maybe not all right that's all for now
i'll talk to you later
