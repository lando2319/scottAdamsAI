dude
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
I'm pretty sure you've never had a
better time I don't care what your
spouse says and if you'd like to take
this experience
up to a level where the dopamine and the
oxytocin flow freely well all you need
is a cup of a glass of tanker chalices
dye the canteen geographlask of vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
I like my coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine in it
today thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
yeah that's good
that's good
well today is going to be an extra good
amazing show
how would you like me to completely
solve
the problem of you not trusting ballot
boxes in this coming election would you
like to see me solve it
all right here we go
all you have to do is monetize
the process
so if I were to say to you you know what
I'm a big news organization and I'll
I'll offer ten thousand dollars I'm not
offering this I'm just suggesting this
could be an idea
um let's say somebody offers ten
thousand dollars
for a video of something that is
confirmed to be illegal
and makes a difference you know big
enough to make a difference for a
Dropbox
so you can say to people you know if you
get lucky and you get a video of the
same person coming back several times
let's say you let's say You're A store
owner
and you've got a store window that's
across from a Ballot Box
maybe you put up a trail cam you know
put up some video security
just take it over there and just see if
you get anything
so it'd be a little that little like
mining for a Bitcoin
you know you don't know if you're going
to find a Bitcoin but it's kind of fun
to mine for it just in case you get a
hit
so could you could you monetize
the capture of let's say any voting
irregularities
and then if you did a good job and no
irregularities were found
wouldn't you feel more comfortable
wouldn't you feel better if you'd
monetized it to the point where you're
pretty sure people are watching now or
one important Point very important
you can't have humans hanging around the
Dropbox because that would be
intimidation so no intimidation not even
accidental intimidation don't be hanging
around the drop boxes the ballot drop
boxes
but if you can put a camera up in a in a
legal public way
you might be able to monetize that stuff
think about it all right
fake news update I like to keep you uh
up to date on all the fakeness and the
fake news
well here's one that should bother you
did you know that the Associated Press
the AP
which is a source of much of the news
that other entities report
uh where they report about what the AP
reports
but apparently
last year they announced that they were
in order to
help fund the organization they're going
to find these strategic partners
and they'd have these Partnerships to
subsidize reporters
so the reporters would get some extra
money from these Partnerships
I wonder what kind of Partnerships and
what kind of what kind of political
organizations fund AP well let's see
we've got the Ida B well society and
that was founded by the 1619 project
writer uh Hannah Jones
what's her name
yeah Hannah Jones
um and she teamed up with teamed up with
filmmaker Steven Spielberg's Heartland
Foundation
so that they could Foster quote more
inclusive storytelling
so there you go so that would be an
example let me list you know that
obviously you're going to say oh that's
a left-leaning organization funding them
so it's going to have influence but
that's not a complete story right if I
only told you about the left-leading
people funding the AP you'd probably say
to yourself well you're leaving
something out right like how many
right-leaning organizations from the AP
for example I completely left that out
of the story
so let me read the complete list
of right leading organizations funding
the AP
well that's scooply list that there was
nothing on that list but at least I'm
now complete I've told both sides
because sometimes you tell a story like
this it's all biased you're like only
telling one side but I want to be
complete
that is the complete list of
right-leaning funders for the AP so when
you see news from the AP
what do you think you're saying
do you think you're seeing news or do
you think you're seeing some writing by
people who knows who's paying them
you decide
well I like that the Trump trial date
has been set by judge uh chatkin I think
that's the pronunciation
to be uh
right about the time of super Tuesday
one day before super Tuesday
yep and that's totally legitimate and
there were no political considerations
whatsoever
no that's not true
let me tell you what's true
we live in a zero trust environment
but we still should treat individuals
people like you people like me as
innocent until proven guilty that's a
good standard but when the when you see
uh any part of the government or the
Judiciary do something that looks
sketchy what should be your working
assumption
innocent until proven guilty
no that would be insane no your working
assumptions should be that they're
guilty
that should be your starting assumption
that doesn't mean it's true
it also doesn't mean true that an
individual is actually literally
innocent until proven guilty it's just
that we have to treat it that way
because that's a better system
but when it comes to the official people
the people that we know are corrupt in a
in sort of a general
usual way
to assume that anything they do is
credible and real and for the right
reasons is not really a working a good
working assumption in 2023 you have to
assume that these things are political
you have to assume it's exactly what it
looks like
somebody chose the least good date
for Trump
now that doesn't mean it's true
if you ask me to prove it I'd say well
how do I prove what somebody's thinking
can't prove that
I'm just saying that if you can't prove
it and they
all just you know let's say mysterious
intentions if they can't prove it with
transparency then your best
operating assumption is it's exactly as
crooked as it looks even if it's not
it's the right assumption
all right but I like the fact that
they're now so obvious about it
you know if you had any doubts about
this being a political process to take
Trump off the board there's no more
doubt about it right
you know once you get this obvious
but how would you like a little wake-up
call anybody want a little wake-up call
I would like to recount
conversations I've had in the past week
with other citizens of the United States
goes like this
so uh did you hear the story about Vivek
ramaswami and that time and uh whoever
I'm talking to will say who
Vivek Vivek ramaswamy running for
president
who
seriously you've never heard of Vivek
ramaswamy
Vivek
no nope nope and then I'll say
how about
pregosian
have you heard of this guy pragosian
what
progosian
who's he
died in a plane crash had a Wagner
not ringing a bell Wagner was Wagner
do you think how much of the country do
you think
even knows that the Trump trial date is
on super Tuesday what percentage of the
country knows that
less than one percent
right yeah we're all weirdos if you're
watching this you're in the weirdo of
the weirdo of the weirdo situation
you're like a double weirdo it's like a
weirdo if you're watching the news at
all apparently yeah I think fewer than
10 of the country are watching the news
but of the ones who watch the news
how many are watching at a level
that they would understand about the
Trump trial date or even though which of
the four indictments it refers to
nobody knows that I'm barely hanging on
that I do this every day
every day I'm checking the news like
it's basically I guess you could call it
my job if that's what this is
um and I I'm just hanging on I can't
keep the four indictments straight can
you
if I said quickly quick name all four
indictments good you got them
all right if you could name a lot of
people said yes and I believe you
the people say yes
just remember how unusual you are
very very unusual no more than one
percent of the country no more than one
percent could name all four indictments
so how much of the Vita the voters going
to take that into account
so don't don't fall into your little uh
bubble where you think anybody knows
anything about politics they just don't
the country has no idea what's going on
but it's also at least it's obvious the
ones paying attention
I like the one thing I like about it is
that we don't have to wonder if this
system is rigged
it's about as rigged as it could
possibly be
uh Newt Gingrich thinks that uh
Biden is cognitively impaired and that
who's really running in the country is
some combination of
uh Obama and Clinton
still you know usually they're people
but you know on behalf of the big powers
true or false
I don't know
I I've I forget who said this but
somebody said
that if you could dig into the Clinton
you know the Clinton Global initiative
thing it would be so dirty was this newt
maybe it was Newt somebody said it
that if you could actually dig in and
see what they did it would make the
Biden crime family look like you know
littering
it would be so obvious and so big
I believe that I believe it because
it's a big entity with not enough
transparency and they are guilty until
proven this
all right
um
are you following the the account on X
called Trump history
and once a day or maybe more than once a
day they publish a fake a fake parody
picture of created by AI that looks real
but is Trump and a variety of historical
situations you know like using inventing
the light bulb and you know usually
doing insanely funny things but the one
the one that I just I I wish I could
show it to you I don't have an extra
screen but you have to go to my my ex
thread or what do you call it the feed
and you have to see the one that that is
titled Donald Trump tells a young Vivek
ramaswamy that he will choose him to be
his VP in the 2024 election you see this
little Indian kid who's like six years
old and you see Trump like leading in
talking to him intently It's the
funniest thing I I've been just thinking
about it all morning it is just so funny
that that these AI pictures are great
these fake historical things
but it's not just that they're fake and
the pictures are good uh it's that this
one was really chosen with comedic is
just comedic Perfection I don't know
who's Beyond it
all right uh let's call this the spunky
25.
do you know what I'm do you know what
I'm referring to the spunky 25
the 25 of the country that gets every
poll wrong meaning there's if there's
one really stupid answer for a poll
25 percent of the country is going to be
right on that point all right here's an
example Rasmussen Pole 65 percent of
Voters think the current situation with
at the border with the migrants
is a crisis so 65 percent of the country
says the Border situation is a crisis
but interestingly how many could watch
that situation and say it's not
24 24 percent
yep
24 of the country says that it doesn't
look like a problem to me
and the findings haven't changed since
May
60 of the likely voters
in the U.S think that the migrant crisis
is more important than to National
Security than supporting Ukraine
30 say supporting Ukraine 30. well it's
not too far from 25. say supporting
Ukraine is more important than the
Border
now
I don't know if anybody's done this
before or if it worked I'll just I'll
just run this by you as an idea if Trump
were to
reorient his campaign
toward giving Americans what the polls
say they want
and just tell you that
would you have a problem with it
suppose you said look 60 percent of you
want the Border you know to be taken
care of so I'm going to do that and then
hold up another thing that says all
right 70 of you who say you want this
so I'm going to do that
now it wouldn't be leadership it
wouldn't be leadership it would be
following the public
but are there sometimes you should
follow
and sometimes you should lead
well National Defense is one of those
things you should probably lead would
you agree
let me give you a reframe
Your Leader should lead during the fog
of War
Your Leader should lead during the fog
of War when you don't know what's what
somebody's got to make a decision
somebody's got to act fast somebody's
somebody's got to take the
responsibility they're going to take the
pain they're going to take the
um the credit
you gotta have a leader and that leader
if that leader is doing something you
don't agree with or even the majority of
the country well it's because you hired
them
you know you hired him to do this
to make the fast decision before the
public even knows what the situation is
but here's my reframe
does that stay that way
once the public becomes informed and
once the truth of the facts become
hardened so we're kind of looking at the
same situation and then the public
decides well you know what you know I'm
glad we had a leader to act fast but now
that we have better information maybe we
should pull back from that position
at that point once the public is
reasonably informed if they say no bueno
we're not going to do this anymore do
you think a good leader says no I still
disagree with the majority or does a
good leader say thanks for trusting me
when it was ambiguous to somebody at the
lead and now that we all see this
situation you know what I think I'd
rather give the public what they want
what's wrong with that
what's wrong with being a leader when
you need a leader and being a let's say
a populist
when we have a better understanding of
the situation there's nothing wrong with
that is that flip-flopping
sound like flip-flopping to you
we'll talk about flip-flopping no that
would just be a reasonable person doing
reasonable things
so as much as I think that you need your
leadership when things are ambiguous I'm
not sure things are as ambiguous as they
were
um
so even uh Bernie Sanders is not giving
his
let's say unambiguous support to Biden
he obviously he prefers him over Trump
or somebody but he's uh he's he's
choosing his words carefully about
Biden's age
trying to tiptoe around it without
actually lying about it
uh but he has got a signaling that his
concern without ever saying anything of
that nature it's just the way he words
it you say sounds like you're wording it
in a way to protect them we get it
um
and uh and I guess Bernie expressed some
bewilderment that's the word being used
bewilderment
that the Republicans have more support
from working class voters than Democrats
do
are you are you like shocked
that working-class people think the
Republicans might have a better idea by
a little bit it's not a gigantic
difference but that they're more than
competitive with the Democrats
now I think Bernie's point would be look
at all these things Biden did for you
and you would say infrastructure plan
and
you know I don't know
what else I can't think of anything else
what else do you do
I'm not sure what the infrastructure
plan I haven't really seen anything
happen from that
yeah the other things that he's doing or
you know inflation your gas prices are
going up uh there's an unnecessary War
the borders completely uncontrolled
people coming for your jobs AI is going
to destroy you there's no plan for that
you know I don't think it will actually
but
why is that a mystery do you are you
bewildered is anybody like I don't know
what's going on here
I can't figure it out
I I saw Tucker Carlson in some interview
say that he thought uh Trump would be
the most consequential president of our
lifetime and I completely agree with
that but he pointed out that there were
three I hope I remember him
three Trump
um truths that now we just accept as
true when they seemed a little crazy
so he started with gotta lock up that
border and I think even reasonable
people said you know I get it that there
are people coming across illegally but
there always have been
and you know we're doing okay
right that wasn't crazy
that was not my view but it wasn't crazy
to say yeah the border is not secure
but we're also doing fine you know let's
just leave them alone maybe they get a
better life out of it right you can see
that
but at the moment is anybody saying that
I don't think anybody is no nobody who
knows the actual situation that they're
not even Central in South Americans
coming over at this point it's all
Europeans and Asians and
um and Africans coming in
so and they're coming in with the
cartels you know huge business model
they're making billions of dollars or
whatever
so
so Trump was clearly right about the
Border we should have secured it
was clearly right about China you know
hollowing out the middle class and we
had to you know get tougher with China
um and I I would argue he was definitely
right about energy but I think I think
uh Tucker had
a third he had a third example
forget what it was but there were three
things that when you heard him you're
like you know he was really right about
the biggest the biggest things
was it about that it wasn't about the
fake news although he was right about
that I mean Trump is the one that taught
us that the news was fake
think about that
think about the fact that Trump is the
one who taught us the news was fake in a
way that you didn't really understand
before I mean you always saw some of the
news was fake but did you know
it was all fake
basically it's basically all fake now
they might sometimes get one right
but I think it's a coincidence I don't
think it's because they tried
I think I think if it's anything about
politics or you know and that would
include anything with science so so
science is all political now right
because if science shows something then
you got to do something different
politically so science is just politics
at this point
Am I Wrong the science and politics
merged
I'm not rob
by the way has anybody said that before
I I like that reframe
science is great but what we now have is
a hybrid of science plus politics if you
add politics to science you get a
science by itself pretty terrific in the
long run in the short run science is
just a coin flip
it's it's just a coin flip at the
beginning and and I mean even after
you've done a study
because the number of studies that are
peer reviewed that end up later being
not supportable is about half that's
actually a coin flip
so science starts as no more dependable
than a coin flip you know in the early
hypothesis stage well hypothesis is
lower than the coin flip you know by the
time you've done one published study
you're up to a coin flip right so you
started well 10 chance maybe worth the
shot let's study it up to 50 if your
study says yes but you're only 50 that's
just a coin flip and then maybe after 30
years lots of studies and lots of
arguments there then we kind of
solidify on something we say yes the big
bag definitely happened just the way we
said
and then you wait 30 years and find some
evidence that says the Big Bang couldn't
have been what you said but you were
happy for 30 years that's science
it turns out it wasn't right after all
uh in some substantial ways
all right um
as I tweeted the other day and actually
saw a number of agreements which I
wasn't expecting
um
the trajectory of at least cities and
certainly some other things in politics
certainly the Border is that it looks
like it couldn't get any worse doesn't
it it's like you know things are just
going down
so the border security could not
possibly be worse than it is right now
the cities the cities are just lost at
this point
but here's the optimism you ready
here's the optimism
it has to hit bottom because you're
dealing with addicts
right the people who are supporting the
current failed system are addicts I
don't know what they're addicted to
they're either addicted to maybe the
public approval of doing woke
you know liberal things it might be
they're addicted to the the feeling of
being the person who's fighting the
fighting the big Power maybe maybe
they're addicted to the power maybe
they're addicted to the the money the
person to use maybe they're addicted to
supporting their team
but whatever it is is not based you know
on a reason
you can't look at any of our cities and
say Well that's
that's what we planned and it's working
fine so let's keep doing more of it you
can't do that but here's the problem
as long as the city's limp along
and you know they still have traffic and
some business and stuff maybe it just
keeps going you know slightly worse
every year
our best case scenarios that we had
bought them
do you know what hitting bottom would
look like
a Democrat saying it I'm a
republican now
that's what it looks like
as long as there's still Democrats all
the way down you're not at the bottom
you get you hit the bottom when somebody
says Whoa everything I thought was wrong
like an addict right the Drinker is
thinking well I could quit but I like it
and then when you hit the bottom they're
like okay
I quit
because no choice now
so we're not at the bottom
but don't look at our rapid decline as
necessarily A you know a one-way street
we have to hit bottom before it gets
fixed
so once the cities are a little bit more
unlivable
maybe a lot more
then something will happen I don't know
what will happen but it'll be some
correcting Force but don't worry that
the cities are getting worse unless you
live in them and if you do live in the
city
why why
unless it's a republican City that's
running well why would you do that get
out of those places get the hell out let
it fail let it fail as quickly as
possible then you got a chance
all right here's uh my section I call
Biden dementia takes
Biden dementia takes
um
you said that the U.S intelligence
Community has determined that domestic
terrorism rooted in white supremacy is
the greatest terrorist threat we face in
the Homeland
so he got that from the U.S intelligence
Community the U.S intelligence community
huh the U.S intelligence Community have
they ever been wrong
let's see so the people who were sure
that the hunter laptop was Russian
disinformation
are also sure that our greatest threat
is this white supremacy well it's almost
like you're saying that the organization
that we trust the least is saying
something that on its surface sounds
ridiculous
how often has that been true
U.S intelligence people
saying something that the rest of us
think is sort of ridiculous on the
surface
hmm it might be the least credible thing
anybody ever said
now he of course he's parsing his words
carefully
so he's saying it's uh it might be the
greatest terrorist threat
what are the other terrorist threats and
how do you measure them
how do you measure the terrorist threat
that hasn't happened
isn't the whole point of terrorism you
don't know when it's going to happen and
when it does it could be a big deal
how does he know that the biggest
you know Islamic terrorist threat of all
time your radical Islamic terrorists
let's say
um isn't tomorrow
how
if you want you want the ultimate I'm
going to give you the ultimate
conspiracy theory
you ready the ultimate conspiracy theory
I can see no reason that we haven't had
ongoing terrorism in the United States
from foreign sources
I don't see any way that could be
possible unless
they were never real in the first place
meaning that things probably blew up and
people really died
but I mean that who is backing them
exactly
exactly who is backing them that they
can't do the simplest thing in the world
which is
blow up something or destroy something
United States
I don't like to brag
but if I ever decided to become a
terrorist
in the United States
I think I could take down the whole
country in about a week
I don't even feel like it's that
difficult
so I mean if you called your shots
correctly and planned right right it
wouldn't be that hard and yeah and yet
the total terrorist threat at the moment
from foreign sources appears to be
basically zero
like I I don't even think about it do
you
and can you point to anything that would
have caused that to happen
I can't is it because we were so nice to
people in the Middle East
you know while fighting Isis we did it
so professionally and politely the Isis
when we're done said you know what good
fight guys
yeah you win
yeah we're going to take our beaten and
go home you know you win this one what
could we do
no there's there's something that
terribly doesn't make sense
it terribly terribly doesn't make sense
that we're not saying and I was also
suspicious about why they have to do
grandiose exploding
uh operations really that's the only
thing you could do to hurt a country
is grandiose explodey things that's it
now that was always such a tell for
something not being what it looks like
if we wanted to destroy a country we
wouldn't limit it to one kind of
specific attack that's easy to stop or
easier to stop than some other things
so I don't know what I don't know who to
blame or what's going on I'm just saying
that the whole terrorism
um let's say narrative couldn't possibly
be the one we have not in other words
what's explained to us as Americans
couldn't possibly be true
not not even a little bit
right would you agree now we're watching
Refinery fires
food processing fires
and the question is how many of those
people that came across the border
from other countries are actually just
terrorists
and they're they're doing the the smart
way to destroy a country which is a
little bit at a time
just just keep biting little edges off
I don't know I don't know what to
believe because there's no way to know
what's true anymore all right so uh
Biden dementia take number two he
actually said this
and he's still and he's still in office
all right I want you to hold it to your
head
how insane this is this next story
and that Biden's still in office
I just say that you're still in office
and here's something you said out loud
clearly and intentionally in in public
you said uh quote I was able to
literally not figuratively talk Strom
Thurmond into voting for the Civil
Rights Act
problem number one
Biden was 22 years old
when the Civil Rights Act was voted on
do you think that what he was 22 that he
personally talked to Strom Thurman into
voting for it
the answer is no because Strom Thurman
famously voted against it
famously against it
not only did he not talk to him Not only
was it now literally but he didn't
change anybody's mind because Strom
voted against it
now he said this in public
right
the the news reported it so it's not
like anybody missed it
nobody's claiming he was joking right
nobody's claiming he was joking nobody
was claiming he misspoke
nobody's claiming he was taken out of
context
nobody's even claiming he lied
just hold this in your head for a moment
he's the commander-in-chief
now how much more broken
could at least the Democrats I mean you
you could argue all right let me broaden
this
and you're telling me that the
Republicans have not started an
impeachment process the impeachment
should be driving him toward the 25th
you know
replacement is it only because column is
worse
are there even or even the Republicans
afraid of common
maybe so they don't want to give her a
little boost because then she might run
for president from that boost
somebody says he wasn't lying he was
talking about the Civil Rights Act of
1991.
there were two Civil Rights Acts all
right we're getting a fact check there
fact Jack give me a fact check
there were two things with the same name
so he was saying he was referring to a
different bill
oh this is interesting
because if you're if you watch uh you
know right-leaning X
I didn't see anybody fact check that
but I'm seeing people all right let's
let me let me pivot
allow me to Pivot
I'm gonna only I'm only gonna mock uh
Snoopy boobs here who says I'm getting
burned
here's a little lesson for you
if your brand is that you're always
right
in these situations you would be
triggered into cognitive dissonance and
you would argue that it couldn't
possibly be true that the story is wrong
because that would embarrass me in
public
if you can't be embarrassed
you won't get cognitive dissonance
right so my brand is I will change
instantly when the information does
and that probably happens a lot
so it looks like it's happening right
now it appears that in public I'm being
humiliated by my critics
for having a wrong fact which looks like
they might be right by the way I'm not
going to doubt them I I think I'll look
into that so
watch me not experience cognitive
dissonance
I just said oh that looks like you might
have a good point there because that's
exactly what the news does in fact the
next things I'm going to be talking
about are that the news does exactly
that so if it's true that I got got and
it looks like it is
that's a good story
and I'll just tell you that I fell for
it
everybody good
all right
so all right let's look into that it
doesn't make uh it doesn't make him any
less dementia
but uh maybe that wasn't true
did you hear the story about uh Tucker
Carlson explaining how he was called by
some spook type person who knew that he
was negotiating to do an interview with
Putin
so I think this is back when he worked
at Fox News and he was actually told
that
his signal account is encrypted app
wasn't secure and the NSA was just
reading his messages
now can I remind you again
everything you put in a digital forum is
discoverable
no matter what they tell you
it's discoverable one way or the other
right one way to discover it is they
just have access to the recipient's
phone
so maybe the message got sent you know
all all encrypted just like you should
but once it reaches the other person's
phone you know it's being sent to a
screen
so presumably you could pick it up
between the you know the encrypted app
and what it presents on the screen
because at that point it's not encrypted
right so if you own the phone of the
recipient
it doesn't matter if you're encrypted or
not
and that's just one way to do it the
other way to do it would be if they had
a back door and we don't know about it
could have a back door
don't know
um
so you should assume that all your
digital Communications are
public which is public
never say anything that you wouldn't say
in public
all right
uh that's the best advice I'll ever give
you
so there's this weird thing going on
with the coverage of Vivek
and it goes like this
um he'll be on an interview podcast or
the news somebody will take something
you said in a context
and they'll ask him to defend it why did
you say x and then he'll say well I
didn't I didn't say that here's what I
did say and then they'll say well oh you
say you didn't say that well here's the
source
and then the source will support Vivek
and yet the person pointing to the
source won't be able to see it or know
it or acknowledge it as if they're
looking at a different movie and saying
oh I'm looking at the sound of music but
it's really Schindler's List I mean that
and I've seen it several times now
and then what do they do after it looks
like
he's been taken out of context but they
won't admit it
then they say what's the next thing they
say then they say he's a flip-flopper
they say he's a flip-flopper because
they say the new thing you're saying
that's different than the thing you said
before but it isn't and it never was
it's the same
and so now they call them a flip-flopper
and then there's a step after the
flip-flopper accusation
they take all the times that they've
done this to him and they put it in a
list and then they posted it on X they
say look at all these times he's
flip-flopped and in fact every one of
those is him being taken out of context
he tells you you know what he really
thinks and how it was taken out of
context they've refused to acknowledge
that he ever said that that he ever you
know gave them the accurate story and
then they call him a flip-flopper and
then they put it in a list
and so here so here's another one
and here's the test to know when they're
doing it okay remember the really test
where there'll be a claim in the news
and here's a way way you can tell it's
fake just say really
really
seriously if you can't get past the
really test probably not true all right
let me give you one
the claim is that Vivek says if he were
president he would end funding in Israel
to Israel in 2028.
now that would be just you know four
years after taking office
and Israel one of our most important
allies certainly politically You could
argue most important
so do you think that a republican
running for a major office
let me ask this do you think a
republican running for a major office
suggested something that Israel and all
supporters of Israel would immediately
go
and never be able to recover from it
really
really
do you really do you really think that
someone is smart and as good with his
messaging as Vivek would have really
said that
you think he really would have thought
oh here's a good idea
does anybody want to say they believe it
does anybody want to say they believe
her right now before I give you any more
information I want to oh somebody says
they believe it really you really
believe that a major candidate said he
was going to screw Israel which is what
it would sound like
a major candidate who says he's going to
screw Israel while running for president
that actually sounds believable to you
somebody who went to Harvard is so
capable that he's rising up rising up
the rankings it's all we're talking
about and that that guy
was so smart in every way
but somehow didn't realize that a clear
message of non-support for Israel would
somehow hurt him and make him
unelectable he wouldn't realize that
right
really
all right you want to hear what the real
story is
of course it was conditional
of course
do you think he said that if
everything's the same as it is now I'm
just going to take the funding away
really
you don't think it was a conditional
statement
it was a conditional statement and
here's the condition
that he would expect he would expand the
Abraham Accords
so that the entire region would be in a
safer more stable situation and then
once stable
they wouldn't need our help
so once the situation changes from the
current situation where they probably do
need our help
to a situation where you and I would all
agree oh it looks like they're much
safer now you know now it's totally safe
but much safer and they could maybe
handle it on their own
does that sound crazy
it might be too optimistic
if you say oh that's way optimistic yes
yes that's way optimistic but shouldn't
he be aiming for it
is it wrong to aim for that
because in four years he you know four
years after 2024 he could say you know
we didn't get there
but if we had gotten here we'd be
talking about cutting funding but we
didn't get there
now would that be crazy
now when I explained what he really said
do you really believe that he just said
if everything stays the same I'll just
cut funding in four years to Israel does
anybody believe that now
it would be crazy
now I should not have had to explain
that it was a conditional statement
you should have seen that from the start
and it and the start is nobody would
have said that out loud all right here's
another one
do you believe that a president and
actually sitting president went on TV
thought about what he was going to say
and then said that neo-nazis are fine
people
really
do you really believe that somebody
actually did that and of course the
answer is they didn't of course they
didn't it was you know it was a rupar at
it you never said that
you said the opposite of it literally
and directly
right here's another one do you think
that a sitting president of the United
States
once stood in public with a bunch of
science doctor people and suggested that
you should or at least that it was worth
looking into uh drinking disinfectant
really
really
that's possible that maybe that actually
happened no no you didn't need to know
the whole background story that there
was in fact a test about putting light
into into at least the trachea and they
were you know maybe thinking about the
lungs later and that the light was a
disinfectant and that the news took
light as disinfectant and misinterpreted
as chemical disinfectant all right now I
shouldn't have had to give you the
explanation because the moment you heard
it okay that didn't happen
now here's where it's trick you with
Biden
so I looked at this news which I think I
probably got wrong based on your fact
checks and he would he said something
that would have been like so crazy
that they would have
you know 25th amendment in that day
so probably I should have said
do you really think that he said that he
that he helped Strom Thurmond vote for
something he didn't vote for
except that Biden has a history of
saying wildly ridiculous things that you
can't tell if it's Dementia or not
so under that specific situation Biden
doesn't fit into the really
because Biden actually does say things
that seemed disconnected from you know
reality
so here's a special case where the
reality test doesn't work
but if you've got somebody who's a
functioning person like all of the
candidates all of the candidates except
Biden are functioning if you heard that
in RFK Jr is the same thing by the way
if you look at the RFK Junior attacks
just just try this really
really a guy as smart as RFK Jr
you're telling me that he said whatever
it is that he said that
um like all vaccinations are bad or
something I think that's one one of them
is do you really think he said all
vaccinations are bad
despite being vaccinated and these kids
are vaccinated
probably not
more likely he had a problem with how
well they're tested maybe something
about the liability you know that would
be reasonable but no
if it sounds ridiculous it probably is
all right here's a little uh I'm going
to give you some persuasion
takes uh DeSantis and Vivek
Vivek has in my opinion the best
persuasion game on top of communication
communication is just you know saying
what you want to say persuasion is what
Trump does
now I I told you that Trump was the best
visual Persuader but he'd also make you
think past the sale
so you weren't just thinking does he
want to build a wall yes or no you're
thinking the actual structure of the
wall you're saying well what do you make
it of right that's what Trump does he
makes you think past the decision wall
or no wall all the way to whoa what's
that all going to be made of basic good
persuasion
so when Vivek says the FBI is corrupt
which other people have said
he doesn't leave it there
he doesn't just tell you that he wants
to you know change the FBI he says I've
published a detailed plan of where those
employees would take their functions so
you don't lose the function you just
lose the the nature of the group same
with the Department of Education
he doesn't just say he wants to get rid
of it which I never found convincing he
says I want to get rid of it and take
that funding and do block grants to the
state
so now I'm wondering about block grants
to the state so I'm already thinking
past he got elected and I'm thinking
past
you know I'm basically he's making now
when he talks about Taiwan
he talks about the short term protecting
him
and he talks about the long-term you
know it might be a different ball game
if we don't have a strategic interest
let's say we're we're doing our
microchips over here
again every time the Vivek talks he
makes you imagine him president
and that he's already doing the job
and you're actually evaluating the
details of how he's doing the job not
the question of whether he got elected
that is pure Trump
uh technique and it's a plus
so if you're judging Vivek only on his
communication ability which is a triple
plus you would miss that embedded in it
is a layer of persuasion skill that
nobody else is demonstrating you know
Trump does nobody but Trump
so if you catch it then you understand
why people like Mike certovic are you
know giving him a strong look
conservix can see the layers right you'd
you'd have to have some experience to to
see the persuasion layer
but wow it's there
the the one thing I would say to Vivek
is he needs to do a better job of
um saying his answer first and then his
explanation for the answer
so he he waits to give the definitive
answer sometimes gives a little too much
context first and that makes it look
evasive
when in fact he doesn't need to evade
anything because he's never run for many
of his opinions so he's not trying to
evade anything he's just giving you know
a good complete answer but if the
complete answer doesn't start with the
the conclusion
it's it's a persuasion mistake
and I don't know that Trump ever does
that by the way
this would be interesting I've never
noticed them to it but if Trump if Trump
has asked the question
he'll give you the answer first and then
he'll tell you why am I wrong
watch for that I think you're going to
see that that he answers first that's a
very strong technique
the other thing I'd love to see Vivek do
that I've been doing and it works is
that you before you give your direct
answer you give just a little bit of a
context reframing
all right so when I'm asked about my
controversial uh comments the way that I
do that is I well you know I'm not sure
that the most of your viewers understand
the news about public figures is never
real
now do you do you know who did that
reframe first
that's the Steve Jobs reframe I borrowed
that from him
yeah when he had the problem with
antenna gate instead of saying well our
phones have this problem we'll do what
we can that would be weak he started by
saying all cell phones have problems all
smartphones have problems and then
everybody said oh well that's actually
true so the context is now I understand
the context they all have problems so
when we talk about yours it won't seem
special to me it'll just be in the
context of yeah they all have problems
and then the news reported the next day
after Steve Jobs said that yeah all
smartphones have problems and they even
mentioned them they mentioned the other
company's problems
you can't get a better persuasion than
that
by the way
do you know why Steve Jobs was known for
having a distortion a reality Distortion
field around it
and yet you never heard that about Bill
Gates did you
did you ever have did you ever hear oh
Bill Gates he's got that reality
Distortion field around him
do you know why it seemed
that jobs unique among people
had a reality Distortion to field around
him
I will answer that question
with one word
reframes
if you listen to Steve Job talk Steve
Jobs talk he reframes first like he did
with antenna gate
and then you know he gives his argument
let me give the most famous the most
famous example was when he was trying to
get uh Scully to leave Pepsi he was
president of Pepsi he wanted to leave
that job and be the head of apple and he
famously said to him after Scully had
said no no no no no no toward the end of
the meeting he said well the question is
this it comes down to this question
do you want to sell sugar water for the
rest of your life or change the world
now what's that
that's a reframe
that's a reframe
jobs spoken reframes
and when you speak in reframes reframes
are basically a
form of hypnosis
then probably Nobody But Me would call
it that but as a form of persuasion
that's so strong and can happen so
quickly like the reframes I just
mentioned they happen so quickly that
your brain goes from I'm over here to
what
and that's the reality Distortion field
it's the feeling that you you were sure
of this until he said that and he
reframed it and the reframe was so good
your brain just said I give up well I'm
taking your reframe and then you have
this feeling like reality is loose
like he can move it around
it's not it's it's not an illusion
he's actually moving reality around
that's what a reframe does
he is literally changing reality because
your reality is subjective
right you could argue that there's a
base reality I don't know but your
reality is subjective and when he
reframes you as quickly as he does and
he did it almost everything he talked
about it was a refrain do you remember
the slogan for the early Macintosh
thing different
that's a reframe
it assumes that everybody using these
old boring ibms were like drones I am a
drone I'm just typing I'm using word and
maybe a little bit of excel but I do not
have any creativity no I'm like
everybody else
who in the world likes to admit they're
like everybody else nobody
internally everybody thinks they're
different right
everybody thinks they're different
internally
externally we look at people and go
you're just like that other person but
internally we all think we're special
special snowflakes right
so that was a reframe he reframed it
from is this computer better than this
one too
do you think differently
or are you one of these drones
that was a hell of a reframe elderly
frame all right so I would like to see
Vivek do a refrain
for some of these challenging questions
so so he could say you know
um I'm going to answer this question
directly but just some context you know
that there's this weird thing happening
where people are taking everything I say
out of context and then challenging me
and then saying that I'm flip-flopping
if I simply explain what the original
context was so we won't do that today
but to answer your question the answer
is no and here's why
so that that that's the Forum that just
wins every game if if you say the
playing field is this
and then you describe a reasonable
playing field so my playing field is
that this fits into a a pattern of
stories
here's my Playing Field playing field is
the pattern and now you're going to have
to explain why this isn't another one of
those you know why isn't this a rupar
what I explained what a rupar is before
I before I explained that something is a
case of it it goes over way better
if you start by saying okay this one
thing is a rupar and what they did was
they changed the edit you might you
might convince some people
you might but if you do it this way
okay you know that this is a widespread
most normal technique and they've done
it in this case in this case in this
case you can see each of the cases where
they took something out of the quote
which has the weird effect of actually
reversing its meaning it doesn't seem
like it's possible but you know you can
see it a number of times and then when
you talk about your next situation
people are all prime just like oh that's
a rupar I get it I get it it's one of
those
so that's the technique let's talk about
DeSantis DeSantis is a very capable
person
but his body language doesn't match what
I think is happening on the inside of
his head now I can't read his mind
but I have the following let's say
beliefs about him
I believe that all observation and his
personal history suggests
that he's confident
and capable
would you would you say he's confident
and capable based on observation
I think so I think he's both confident
and capable
however his body language screams the
opposite
screams it
right number problem number one he has a
head shaking problem
look at me talking
all right I'm talking about Ron DeSantis
and I'm telling you the As a head
shaking problem
notice my ad isn't moving too much now
I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about let's say
inflation and I'm going to do a Ron
Santos we've had inflation here since
the beginning the the inflation rate has
been you know it's been uh it's been
higher but now it's a little bit lower
but they're not counting it right
right the shaking the head is refuting
his own voice
that's number one number two he has liar
eyes
liar eyes liar eyes are the the ones
that are too wide
because when you open your eyes wide
you're trying to get somebody to believe
something that you don't believe
all right let me let me give you the
difference
this is not liar eyes so I'll say
something that's true
yesterday was a really nice day
okay now I'm going to give you liar eyes
I'll say the same thing but I don't
believe it was a really good day I just
want you to believe it
yesterday was a really good day
liar eyes they're way wide
he has liar eyes now I I only see him in
public
but I can't believe yeah Chef he has
Adam Schiff liar eyes you're right but I
can't believe that his eyes looked like
that when he's talking to his family
do you think his eyes are all the way
open when he talks to his family
now the all the way open is that you
don't believe what you're saying but you
think if you change your face you might
be able to sell a little better
it's a recognition that there's a
weakness with his argument
now he also has what I call pleading
voice
pleading voice
uh here's if you want to see contrast
here's here are some people who don't
have pleading voice
Pence
when Pence talks whether it is right or
wrong
his voice says he believes it and this
is a fact
he'll say we've got to do this because
of this
we have to do that because of that if we
do this we'll get this effect if we do
this we'll get that effect that's pets
Trump talks that way uh Vivek talks that
way you know most most politicians have
a command voice that's Command Voice
pleading voice
sounds like
we've got to do something at the border
because there's lots of people coming
over I'll kill people dead if they come
over the Border it's not quite up talk
but but there's something that
speaks to a lack of relaxation in the
chest
maybe that's what's happening but the
the raised voice is the I don't believe
what I'm saying but I hope you will
now
I started by saying that I think he's a
confident like internally I think he's
actually a confident capable guy
but his body language is screaming the
opposite and I feel like people are
picking up on it and then on top of that
he has sort of a corporate
choice of words
you know he's he's not quite as friendly
talking and familiar as somebody like a
trump or or even a Christie you know
Christy as he has the common touch you
know but also a big vocabulary
so anyway so I think that that's the big
problem with DeSantis uh policies aside
you know you can find policy problems if
you want but I think his body language
is an absolute train wreck and I also
think that that doesn't matter as much
for a governor
it's just that when you go from Governor
to president it's everything
right at the governor level you're
looking at his track record his
capability his stated policies you know
maybe his history
and if he has a funny voice or he blinks
too much or whatever it is you're going
to say well
like he's not he's not my
commander-in-chief
right he's not the commander-in-chief
he's sort of a lawmaking legislation you
know fix the potholes kind of guy I
don't care how he talks I don't care
that his eyes are buggy just fix the
polls
now you talk about somebody who's got to
save the world in case there's a nuclear
confrontation
do you want the guy with the bug eyes
and the Shaky Head and the and the voice
that sounds like he's pleading nope
nope nope nope nope hard now
you can't put him in that position or do
you want somebody like Trump
who's just Trump
which is sort of perfect if you're in a
nuclear confrontation I'm going to pick
Trump every time
every time
right you give me a nuclear
confrontation Trump
right now could Jose could do it
probably
I would have a lot of confidence in
Vivek I would also have a lot of
confidence in Ron DeSantis because I
think the the internal Ron DeSantis
doesn't have the problems that his body
language is projecting I think on the
inside he's he's a solid guy
all right
all right
um here's the the latest from what I
call uh black and white news black and
white news is where the news tries to
divide Us by race uh Chris Cuomo says to
Vivek he shouldn't Compare black any
black person to the KKK my take on this
is I don't give a
I don't care
I don't care who he who he compared to
anything
because the person that was the subject
to this was a person
it was a human one person
it wasn't somebody representing a whole
race it was one
who he said sounded like the KKK and
then gave a specific example to which I
said it's hyperbole that means obviously
hyperbole
is not a literal thing he's he's saying
that you know if you talk like this you
know you're you're more associated with
moving in that direction than the
direction of good and rightness I guess
so everybody understood what he said
right when he compared to somebody to
the KKK that's literally the entire
business model of the rep the Democrat
Party just comparing people to Hitler
comparing them to gobbles gobbels
whoever the hell he is comparing him to
the KKK
that's all it is the business model
literally the business model of the
Democrats is to do this so do I care
that Vivek this one time did the same
thing to shove it back in their
faces No thank you Vivek and thank you
for not apologizing the best part was he
didn't apologize he said no this is why
he said it she said this
nobody agreed with what she said
I mean base was it Presley
who said
that
they didn't need brown people who
weren't supporting the brown point of
view or something about the fake
so yeah she had it coming you say
like that somebody's gonna compare you
to the KKK
that's the way it works
he didn't make the rules
so but do I care that this is a black
white issue nope nope this is about
Vivek and one person he talked about
that's it I am no longer buying into the
idiot uh the average of One race should
be compared to the average of the other
race that's just stupid and I refuse I
refuse to buy into the model it's about
a person it's about a crime
and that's it
all right
let's see what else is going on here
um
so
I don't know how to say this without uh
Saudi egotistical or being too much
about me so I'm not going to worry about
it I'll just do it
um
you know that when an author writes a
book
it then is part of the job to promote it
and do the marketing for it and I'm not
super comfortable
with anything that sounds like marketing
or selling because I think the product
has to do that right if the product
isn't selling itself then you should
have tried harder right you you missed
it when you made the product that that's
where everything went wrong
but I've taught you before that there's
a tell
for knowing when something is going to
be big
now here's a rare situation where the
the tell has formed is really you can
really see it strongly but the but the
success has not happened yet
right top of a small level
and that's what's happening with this
book so I I have over I don't know
somewhere in the 40 to 50 book range if
you count the Dilbert reprint books I
think
I forget how many regular books I've
written a dozen or so but so I've seen
I've seen what happens when a book is
launched and what it looks like usually
it's me talking about it and some people
who like things I do buy the book and
then sometimes they write good reviews
most of the time I'm lucky to say and
you know and then maybe some other
people look at it and they buy the book
so that would be a normal you get a big
again big sales bump when you're doing
the marketing and then you know if
people like it maybe it lasts a little
while that's normal
that does not necessarily predict a big
hit
because that's just the the normal cycle
that every book goes through if if
there's any promotional push
however there is a tell
That You Don't See often that is just
screaming about
this book and the tell is people
extending the model
so today there is yet another pirated
book on Amazon I call it a pirated book
it's listed as a workbook
so there are now three people who have
ripped off my book the same week it was
published
to to have a rip-off
have you ever seen that before
has anybody ever seen that before even
once this happened three times in a week
I've never seen it
um
I've got uh already two offers from
other countries I don't mention the
countries but they're notable countries
notable countries for uh translation
rights now the way those offers work is
that those Publishers in other countries
if if you do a deal with them they do
all the work
they literally just take the book and
they put their own cover on it do the
translation Market it and sell it in
their own country
and
the book's only been out a few days you
know a week or so and already other
countries are are asking for it that's
unusual that's unusual
but I don't know if you're following my
Twitter feed but have you seen how many
people are taking a picture of family
members reading the book and reporting
that they're going to have to buy more
than one of them for just their family
that lives in one house
how often do you see people buy more
than one copy of a book
for a family of four
it's happening massively all day long
people are telling me I got two I got
three my wife wanted to read it I have
to buy another one I just got my 12 year
old son's reading it so we had to get
another one I've also gotten massively I
I read the Kindle but I wanted the hard
book The hardcover I bought 10 for a
gift I've never seen anything like it
it's just and then the people who are
reporting that it's already changed
their lives
crazy
if you look at the boat there's still a
few books above it in some of the
categories
if you look at the books above it
read the reviews
of the books that are still above it
which I don't think that's going to last
but the books that are above it
have um like people love them like oh
this is the greatest book I enjoyed it
alone but look at the language they use
as to whether it changed anything about
their life
and then look at the reviews for this
book
and this book is like off the hook
and then also look for a real review
about this book that's also negative
there are a couple of one star reviews
where it's really obvious they didn't
read the book it's just some critic of
mine so if you're if you're famous from
some other domain you always you always
get the critic who comes over it gives
you the one star review and then and
then in the review they make sure that
uh well you judge for yourself
so one of the reviews for one Stars was
there's there's nothing new in the book
does that sound like somebody read it
there's nothing new in there
for those of you who read it
right there's no way there's no way you
would say that even if you did have a
complaint it wouldn't be that
definitely wouldn't be that so you know
that's not a real review
so I've never had a book that didn't
have a bad review that wasn't obviously
just a troll
so there's something happening
and I think it has to do with just being
in the right place at the right time
that at the same time the AI showed us
that words are how intelligence is
formed
in the word combinations and that's what
a reframe is
a reframe is putting words into your
head to replace the words that were
there that weren't helping you
so maybe maybe it's just a time when
people's own minds connected all the
things that were happening in other
places and they said yes I I get that
that's that connects all the dots for me
that might be what's happening I don't
know
all right so here's a little test for
you on
um
well here's a perfect example bow tied
Kong on acts asked chat GPT to write 200
words on me my new book reframe your
brain and it showed the samples now
here's here's that tell for Success why
did somebody think
that creating content for acts in which
they used AI to write reviews for my
book
why do they even think of that
this this is the telephone or something
that's going to be huge when people want
to extend your product and I would call
this one of those something around it
like I want to make some content
that's around your book
that does not happen
for something that's not going to be
enormous
so I mean every single is just glaring
I've never seen this as really where so
let me give you this test I'm going to
read two paragraphs short ones
and you're going to tell me which one I
took from an actual review of my book
from a human being and which one was AI
okay
so I'm not good so I'll read one and
then the other
but let's see if you can guess all right
here's the first one AI or human
the reframe shared in this book are like
a toolbox for the mine shifting from
managing time to managing energy or
seeing critics as mascots instead of
Monsters has had an immediate impact on
my Outlook it's incredible how these
simple changes can rewire our thoughts
and emotions in such a profound way
alright so that's number one
here's number two is it AI or human
imagine converting roadblocks into
opportunities and setbacks into launch
pads this book arms you with a treasure
Trove of strategies to revolutionize
your outlook Adams witty and engaging
style makes complex Concepts accessible
leaving you empowered to seize control
of your mind
so let's talk about the second one so
the second one human or AI
it's funny you're all over the map on
this
all right the answer is that the second
one was AI
and to me it's obvious because real
people don't say things like makes
complex Concepts accessible
well sometimes they do but leaving you
in power to seize control of your mind
is that how your friends talk how did
you like the book well I'll tell you
it uh
it left me empowered to seize control in
my mind
so that was good
yeah so that's AI now look at the Telos
for the human
uh it's incredible how these simple
changes can rewire your thoughts would
AI say
it's incredible
no do you know why
why would AI not say this is incredible
how do you know it's not AI by that one
word incredible
it's an opinion it's a it's an internal
feeling
so the the author who said it's
incredible
is saying I have a feeling
because incredible is not an objective
standard you can't say there's six of
them so it's incredible
it's just a feeling that that's your
tell AI never writes about his feelings
it would if he gave it a super prompt
but it doesn't do it automatically all
right
um
but let's say toolbox for the mind
toolbox for the Mind AI or human
that's somebody who's a good writer
so you can tell they're a good writer
but human yeah human because toolbox is
simple
as opposed to engaging Styles making
complex Concepts accessible
all right a good writer would not write
this sentence engaging style makes
complex Concepts accessible no good
writer would write that sentence
all right
um
yeah let's say uh
yeah
seeing critics as mascots instead of
monsters that's another tell for a human
because out of the whole book the AI
would sort of randomly pick something
but a human would very much have gone to
that example so that was you know I
won't talk about what it's about but in
the book it was a human-ish story so a
human would go to that whereas an AI
might say well they all look the same to
me I'll pick one all right so here's my
uh
here's my take on AI
AI is learns how to write by looking at
all the writing that people have written
that's available for it to study on
right
the world can AI to learn to write well
if if it looks at 99.9 bad writing which
is what I would I would estimate most
writing is
how does it become good
how would it know what the good writing
was
now suppose it went to a list of great
works because you know it doesn't do
that so AI doesn't use reason and say oh
let me see what the smart people say
about this book it doesn't do that
it's just looking at the words and
looking at patterns so how in the world
would it know what good writing was
because all of the examples 99 would be
bad writing
now somebody said well it would be easy
to fix that you know you could point it
as some good writing and then it would
know what the good stuff is
so I said well what would be an example
of good writing that you'd point it to
and somebody said Tolkien be an example
Tolkien Lord of the Rings another would
be Shakespeare
Shakespeare
and then I said
because my ego knows no limits those are
two of the shittiest writers I've ever
experienced Shakespeare is the worst
there's a total disaster of writing and
Tolkien my God that he was criminally
bad at writing
now Tolkien was great at the stories and
characters
but his writing was just exhausting
nobody would teach anybody to write like
Tolkien do you think there's a class
right like Tolkien no because he was a
terrible writer he was just great at
storytelling uh how about Shakespeare
well that's not even writing I don't
even know what that is it's more like
it's more like feeling the words or you
know acting like well I'll be I'll be
more brutal I believe that Shakespeare
is a mass hallucination where smart
people said it was good and then all the
other smart people had to say it was
good
there is no way that Shakespeare
would be good if it dropped today
right if somebody published the first
ever works of Shakespeare and you've
never heard of them you would not be
picking that book up and say wow well
this is the greatest writing I've ever
seen now is a complete hallucination
based on the fact that smart people seem
to have liked it before so you're gonna
say it was smart too now
does it have no redeeming features no
I'm not saying that
no Shakespeare has a entertainment
quality to it but it's not the writing
the writing is just too hard to read
it's it's the feeling of the words
perhaps
so it's the you know maybe the emotion
that they portray without being in the
same form that would be easy to
understand if it were common English
so it has value
more like poetry more like poetry that
would be a better way to say it so it's
not good writing but it might be good
poetry
I'd be willing to accept that reframe
yeah so
so suppose you teach AI look at some
Shakespeare look at some Tolkien now you
know what good writers are but you say
Scott Those are you know those are first
of all they're a little older
right talk is a little bit older so we
don't write like that so give us a more
modern example of a good writer all
right Stephen King
okay
Stephen King great writer right
well it's debatable
debatable I would say he spends a lot of
time in describing things I don't want
to hear about
but on the other hand he also wrote one
of the best books on how to be a writer
it's called on writing so while I can
disagree with Stephen King on politics
here's one book that wasn't fiction it
was about how to be a writer highly
recommended if you want to be a writer
start there I I would recommend it
absolutely
um but
his fiction I can't even read it I
wouldn't say he's a I wouldn't say he's
a good writer as a writer but he might
be a good story thinker he might be good
at organizing stories and characters or
something I don't know
um
so that's what yeah I would say Trump is
an amazing writer you know even with his
occasional typos he's an amazing writer
and he will never get credit for that
not nobody will ever understand that
Trump is one of the best writers in the
modern world
it's it's insane but he is
all right
um
he's an average speller yeah
all right
um
so I don't think I don't think AI will
ever become a good writer unless they
train it to write like one particular
good writer
that could work
so if you said uh right in the style of
oh you know but it still can't do that
so far it really can't write in the
style of
it it's sort of like somebody doing an
impression of a famous person
you can tell it's not the famous person
it's obvious but you still laugh at the
oppression because it reminds you of it
so I think AI is more like an impression
doing an oppression of a human it
doesn't really remind you of what they
can do
oh it reminds you but it's not what they
could do
is Vivek America great again a clever
slogan
oh of a fake America great again I get
it there's a fake America great no I
wouldn't put the America great again in
there again
do you know what I think Trump's slogan
should be
I'm gonna I'm gonna make this a dramatic
reveal all right because because I want
you to wait have a little pause
and then when I say it I'm going to be
quiet for a moment so you just soak it
in all right
so here's what uh Trump's slogan should
be
find out
[Laughter]
and then just stop talking
stop talking
just take a vow of silence until the
election
my my new slogan
find out
because that's where we're at right
well when I said it
let me do a test when I said it could
you feel it
can you see the Goosebumps
that that's feeling feeling it I'm
literally feeling it I can feel it in my
body
right am I the only one
tell me tell me that you can feel that
in your body
some yes some no
yeah some feel it so obviously you know
slogan isn't going to work the same on
everybody
but
um yeah everybody's gonna have a
different reaction
oh I think it'd be funny he's not going
to do that obviously but
it would be funny
you know we've been saying it's the find
down phase but it'd be funny if he said
it
because what what I think about when I
when I hear that find out
I think about one day in jail
you know don't you think the Democrats
are wondering well I wonder what would
happen
if we actually put him in jail
to which I say
go ahead find out
do you really want to know
you're not gonna like it
but find out
I think I think if you reveal too much
you're giving away too much
I think we're in the find out phase and
the find out phase does not require me
to signal signal what it will be before
it is because that's what makes the
finding out so much fun
that you find out when it's too late to
turn back
so wait until it's too late to turn back
and we'll be happy to let you find out
now I of course do not promote violence
in any way and so in non-violent ways
I say
let's find out if that's where they want
to take it they will find out
so that's all I have for you today the
greatest
live stream ever ran late because I
think it was worth every moment and I
think you'd agree
um and I hope those watching on X for
the the first this is the second day
we've done this I hope you're enjoying
the show
and uh we will talk to you
tomorrow thanks for joining YouTube
