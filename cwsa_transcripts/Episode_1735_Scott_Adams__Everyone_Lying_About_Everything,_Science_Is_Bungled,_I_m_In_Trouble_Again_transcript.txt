good morning ladies and gentlemen and
welcome
to what i think will be sort of the
dopamine high of your entire day
or
or have you learned enough
from coffee with scott adams that the
rest of your day will be even better
maybe
maybe so because you know the people who
watch this live stream
science has shown
they are sexier smarter and more capable
of success
is true
and if you don't believe it well you
argue with science not with me
and if uh you want to take it up a notch
and i know you do how about a copper mug
or a glass of tanker chelsea stein they
can't eat yogurt or flask a vessel of
any kind filled with your favorite
liquid what would that be well in my
case
coffee
now join me
please
for the unparalleled pleasure
this will be the dopamine hit of the day
the thing makes everything better this
is really going to get you going get
that dopamine pump working
pump
pump go
oh yeah
yeah
would you like me to teach you now a
hypnosis trick
for rewiring your own brain
for more more dopamine
i can do that
some of you will now have a
next two minutes are you going to have a
life skill
that will
serve you forever
it goes like this
imagine that you have a dopamine pump
in your head
visualize it like it's a some kind of
little device you can visualize the
device any way your mind wants to see it
with details without details
any color any size
but imagine it's a pump and it's pumping
dopamine out and when the pump is not
working you don't have any
and when the pump is working really hard
you got lots of it
so imagine that dopamine pump
whenever you're doing something that
gives you a little a little uh lift
for example
when i have my
first sip of coffee
i know it gives me like just a tiny
little lift
i mean it's not like
the best thing that ever happened to you
in your life but it's a lift and you
feel it
and so when you take that sip or you do
whatever the other activity is
and you know it's going to pump some
dopamine into you
imagine that little pump in your head
and just see the pump pumping out the
dopamine
and if you do that every time you know
that you're actually getting real
dopamine in the normal way
then you'll have this connection you'll
have this visual connection
that you'll start to harden with
practice
of an actual pump
pumping out dopamine
and you should get to the point over
time
when imagining the pump just by itself
will actually trigger the dopamine
now
what i just gave you
is the key
to unlock your own brain
and reprogram it because you can
generalize from this example
all you have to do
is
focus
and reinforce
any two connections that you would like
to have a shared experience with
so if there's something you like
for example after i work out i always
have a protein shake
which i really really enjoy because it's
the closest thing to a treat that i give
myself because i eat fairly healthy
so it's it's a it's the most tasty
sort of desserty thing that's the wrong
word for it
but i really enjoy it
better than most things that i imbibe
so i do it every time i'm done
exercising
when i can
and that little hit is now associated
with the exercise
and i do it over and over over every day
when i exercise
there's protein so there's a purpose to
it i get a little uh pleasure
now do you think that makes me more
likely to exercise
because i've trained myself with like a
little dog treat every time i do it
what do you think do you think that that
literally
makes it more likely i'll exercise that
little habit just giving myself a treat
the answer is yes
yes
it's a tiny little impact
that if you did it every day for a week
you wouldn't notice a difference
if you did it every day for i don't know
a month or two you probably wouldn't
notice a difference
but if you do it every day for three
years
you're just going to be addicted to
exercise
you can actually make yourself addicted
to good behaviors there's a whole book
on that uh the the power of habit
that's a good one to read if you wanna
if you wanna learn how to program your
own brain
the same way a hypnotist or an
advertising executive would
just know it's attention
repetition
and then connecting two things that you
want to connect now it could be it could
be two things that you like
you're trying to bleed the qualities of
one into the other but it could be the
other way too you can create aversions
to things
you can create an aversion to thing by
uh pairing it with a negative
for example
um i don't want to
be a drinker
of alcohol i used to be i liked it a lot
it was great but i don't think it's good
for me
so now whenever the subject of alcohol
comes up
i repeat in my mind
alcohol is poison
sometimes i say it out loud sometimes i
just repeat it in my mind
over time
those two things are just paired
now there's an irrational pairing of
them it's just that they happen at the
same time and i make them happen at the
same time
so you can program you see yourself by
these little connections remember
focus
repetition and that repetition should be
over years
think think of repetition
as a as a multiple year process it's not
this week next month
but if you do this this sort of
repetition with your brain you can
program it over time for almost anything
it's it's amazing what you can get done
and you don't have to be a hypnotist you
just use those simple principles
well what is new
um
i'm announcing the uh
the untimely death of boo the cat so
many of you do my cat boo who would join
us here on these live streams
she was about seven years old she had a
terrible cancer that
couldn't be fixed
and so i tried to keep her comfortable
until her final days which was yesterday
and let me let me tell you something
that's like positive about this
right so you can imagine
you can imagine that i went through a
very bad day yesterday
i'll keep it together for you for you
today yeah just out of uh respect for
the job i guess
um
but there are some things that i learned
that were kind of amazing kind of
amazing
one of them is that there's somebody
whose job it is
now they come to your house to do it you
used to
prior animals i always took them to the
vet and
you know you did it there
so the newer model i don't know where
how
um how widespread this is but where i
live
you can
ask somebody to come to your house
within several hours
and
there's somebody's job there's a woman
who's a doctor so she's apparently a
trained veterinarian
and her job is just this
to come to your house
and help you not just the animal but
help you through it
and you know it's very peaceful there's
a sedative that the animal barely
notices that
animal falls asleep and then they follow
it up with the you know the killed out
so to speak
literally
and
the entire process
is so respectful
that it's it's really it's really
special
but i'm mostly impressed
by the person
um so
there's actually somebody whose job
is to do that all day long you know i
don't know how many she would do in a
day maybe five
maybe more
can you even imagine that
there's somebody who's somebody has um
stepped into that
that job
the the amazing thing about human beings
is that we will do any job
not every person will do every job of
course
but man when something needs to get done
you can find somebody who will do it
it's just the most amazing thing so i
found it inspirational
um
you know as far as the cat's death
itself it's very tough on me you can
imagine
because the the same thing that i
explained earlier about the connecting a
positive thing to your habit
well the cat was very attached to my
habits
so that parts that's going to be really
tough to break
but let's talk about other things that
are more fun
is there anything that's true anymore
pretty much all of it all the news
is a question of whether the news itself
is true
like that's the news the news isn't
really the news anymore and then what do
you think about the news and how do you
interpret it the news is well i don't
know if that's true
that doesn't sound true to me
that's completely different isn't it
now was everything always fake
i feel like maybe it was
don't you
maybe we just didn't know about it or
were more keyed into it
thank you trump for that
but let's talk about the amber turd uh
trial so amber turd got to
testify and now so she'll say some
terrible things about johnny depp but
getting back to my main theme
who would believe her
why would you possibly believe anything
that amber turd said
i mean now that she's been actually
diagnosed by a professional on the stand
who said i've looked into this and she
looks like one of these
you know class b personality types
and one of the main characteristics is
nothing they say is true
like what what's the point of even
having a testimony
you know if i if i were
johnny depp's attorney
and i got to have the final say i say
well you heard amber turd testify
but you also heard somebody testify that
everything she says is probably a lie
medically
you know i'm not even it's not even a
character
insult
i'm not disparaging her
it's not being disrespectful it's a
medical diagnosis that she lies
she's one of those people who is in the
lying category and not just a little bit
because you know everybody lies right
like you you want to be the one who
doesn't
but everybody lies in
some situation you know we all choose
our shots differently i suppose
but
you know it's a universal
unfortunately
but some worse than others and we're not
all medically required to to lie that's
that's different
uh did you see the video i saw mike
cernovich tweeted this a little video of
uh amber on the
on the witness stand
appearing to
snort something
that was in a
uh tissue
and then go
you know as if she has distorted cocaine
now let me be very clear
i didn't see any cocaine
right i i didn't see proof of that so
i'm not saying that happened i'm saying
there's a video that that looks exactly
like it happened
but let's go back to our main theme
main theme of the live stream today
nothing's real
you just can't believe anything
yes it looked exactly like she was doing
cocaine on the witness stand
it looked exactly like it
but do you think do you think that
really was true
i kind of doubt it
i sort of doubt it
but it looked like it so back to the
original theme nothing's you can't
believe anything
there's just nothing you can believe you
can look right at the video
and say huh
um
all right
so dinesh d'souza's film um with i guess
it's got allegations of
voter irregularity in 2020 it has been i
guess the account's been banned by
twitter
i don't know the specifics of why they
banned it
um and i think youtube is banned it now
correct
give me give me some fact checks on this
in case i'm in case i'm out of date on
my information
so now twitter and youtube banned it but
you can still see it on rumble
correct
rumble still has it
is that the only place somebody says 1pm
today
what's that mean
but it's out right
it's it's released
all right and somebody says locals has
it but i haven't confirmed that
all right so here's my story about that
this is just banned enough
there
there's a thing which is two-band like
you can't find it anywhere like hunter's
laptop
and then there's not band at all and
that could be great too
but this is perfectly banned
meaning all it did was make me really
kind of want to see it more than i
naturally would have
i'm like really
this is going to be a little hard to get
are you serious
oh boy
how good is this thing
they're banning it that's that's the
best review i've ever seen for a movie
you know can i get a list of all the
band stuff i like to binge watch it all
like please give me some band content
like i'm just hungry for banned content
now
so
i think uh
dinesh got almost the perfect level of
banning
that should make this a huge hit we'll
see now i don't have any opinion about
the content i haven't seen it
my understanding
is that it makes a good case for uh
further looking into it
i think that's as far as the claim goes
isn't it you know it obviously
strongly suggests there's evidence of
irregularity but is stopped short of
claiming that it's proven
and it and it and it suggests
uh further research which would tell us
for sure whether anything was there or
not
so to me that
doesn't sound like abandonable content
but maybe i'd be surprised if i looked
at it you know i suppose that's why we
look at it
i have a hypothesis about why netflix
traffic is down
i want to see if this sounds at all
like any experience you've had
prior to the pandemic
we might have had one streaming service
and it might have been netflix and the
process for watching a netflix movie
often on your television
would be
um you just fire it up
your password's probably already in
there
and uh
even pick up where you left off so you
don't even have to search for anything
because maybe you're binge watching
already
and there's lots of stuff there you like
and a whole bunch of good content and so
you pick one and it's a really simple
easy interface it's a really clean
experience
right
that was before the pandemic
with no would you say that that
that explains the user experience for
netflix was that fair
clean easy lots of stuff to binge watch
real easy to pick up where you left off
right
okay now the pandemic happens
okay
pandemic happens and then you think you
know i've seen everything on netflix i'm
going to need some more streaming
services
so if you're like me you said to
yourself all right
you know eight bucks a month uh i'm
stuck inside it's the same money i would
have spent it was way less than i would
have spent if i'd gone somewhere
so i'll just give several streaming
services to get me through the pandemic
because it's a real good cost-effective
entertainment
so
then you have the experience like i had
yesterday
let me explain my experience
to watch a show
because now i have lots of options i've
got ipads and phones and different apps
on different things different accounts
and i also have
an apple tv
connected to my tv so i've got all kinds
of options now great options
so i saw there was a notice for a movie
that i wanted to watch
i saw an advertisement for it like oh
i'm gonna watch that
and then the next thing i thought was
is that on amazon prime
or did i say that on netflix
is that is that a disney thing
hbo max
no
no it's hulu it's probably hulu
so the first thing i do is i've got to
figure out where the damn thing is but
i'm like okay that's not that much work
i could google it
that's not that much work right and so i
turn on the tv and it doesn't come on
because the first problem is that i have
several pieces of technology that have
all rotted since the last time i used
them
i don't know why
the tv no longer turned on at the same
time as the apple tv but it used to
uh it's the wrong
now the channel is wrong and uh there
was some there was a cable unplugged i
don't know why
um
so it took me i think 15 minutes
to work out the cabling the hdmi
and why the tv and the box weren't
turning on the remote wasn't working
and then i finally got it on
then i went to look for it do you know
what happens next so you you say oh it's
on this service but it doesn't work for
some reason because my wi-fi was no
longer connected to my apple tv
so i had to go through and figure out
how to re reset it to my new wi-fi
then of course my streaming services
were turned off because i'd had a credit
card problem
lost credit card
so then they were trying to renew and
they were
going to nothing because the credit card
was dead
so
i have to fix my credit cards which
means getting my wallet to look at my
credit card number to put a new credit
card
and then test it and then it's gonna
it's gonna call my phone and it's gonna
test my phone then put in the password
it's going to send it to a device
and you know that thing where you
recover the password that you're sure
you knew but for some reason it's not
working anymore
and and they're going to email you the
new password
they don't email you the new password
i don't i don't want to be a spoiler
sometimes they do it's happened
but usually they really don't send you
anything
and you're waiting for the text or the
or the email
and it just doesn't come
and they know it doesn't come do you
know how i know they know it doesn't
come
because they put a button there that
says retry did you not get it
there they're telling you it's not
common
otherwise it wouldn't be a try again
button if you know what i mean
so i try again
and i wait again
now 45 minutes has gone by i barely
remember the name of the movie i'm
almost there
finally i get my password straightened
out i get my credit card straight now
i've got my wi-fi working my tv and my
apple tv here are now paired the remote
control is working
now i just have to find it
so i'm searching through the various
things because i'm i'm too lazy to
google it because
you know
i've got
because when i usually when i search for
things i do it by voice
and so i pick up my phone and i say
i don't want to say it too loud but
a-l-e-x-a
and then i realized no that's not for
the phone
that's the for the other device but then
i started saying
hey s-i-r-i
but i can't hear me because the
a-l-a-e-x-a is talking and like shut up
i'm trying to talk to my other device
to search for where that movie is whose
name i can't remember now but i can
remember one of the actors if i look up
the actor i could go to his imdb page
and i can figure out what movies and
recently that'll give me the name of the
movie i can search for the movie on
google and find out which subscription
service is on i can go to that
subscription service and that will be
the one that doesn't accept the credit
card
or it can't get me in
but
i figured out i could solve that one i
get in i'm in
i find the movie
i've succeeded
i'm in the right service the technology
is working all of my passwords my credit
cards there's the movie i click on it
and it says what's it say
what's it say when i click on it
available next week
yeah available next week that's the part
i didn't see in the advertisement
available next week
now
in the comments in the comments
how many you how many of you feel me
do you feel me maybe not that exact
experience
but how hard is it just to watch a show
now add on top of that watching it with
another person
try to watch that show with another
person you can't find two people who
want to watch the same thing at the same
time
can't be done
so we went from a time when i was a kid
where there was only one thing on
or three and the uh you just sat down
and you just watch everything
and you were reasonably happy about it
now everybody's so fussy and there are
so many choices you just can't watch
anything
here's my take
before the pandemic watching netflix was
a good user experience
after the pandemic and it's no fault of
netflix netflix is fine
netflix might even be better than usual
but all the other stuff came in and made
it impossible just to use netflix
because then netflix became part of the
problem
when in fact it was a solution before
the pandemic it went from a solution to
part of the problem
and
talk to somebody these days about
watching a movie together
they're going to say ah that's a lot of
work
it's harder than
i
this is no joke
when i consider driving to a movie
theater to watch a movie versus live
streaming it
i think driving to the movie theater is
easier
so there's your reason
i think netflix is suffering from the
fact that the
concept of live streaming got too hard
just too many variables
all right
here is uh i'm going to give credit to
the biden administration full-throated
credit there's there's no
this next compliment
is to show you that i can be objective
because i'm no big fan of the biden
administration
but they're they're doing a push to
promote 3d printing manufacturing in the
united states as part of the supply
chain
solution
to which i say
whoa
that's really good
that's really good
like that's really really really good
because i'm not sure how far you can go
with the
3d printing of parts as opposed to
shipping them from china
but
that's exactly where i would be putting
my focus
because we could actually just make a
gigantic
difference of the supply chain
and our vulnerability if the only thing
we needed was raw materials that are
part of the printer
now of course that's not going to help
you with your rare
earth minerals
but i suspect we'll get better at
recycling that stuff as well
so
yeah maybe 3d printing but plus better
recycling of rare minerals that are
already in a lot of our products
maybe that's
maybe that's how we get china off our
back
this could be a big deal now
let me say
if trump had done this
i would be
equally complimentary
this i would call this the leapfrog
strategy
one of the advantages of
having your country destroyed and maybe
ukraine will learn this is if you get
rid of all the legacy stuff and you can
just start from scratch
you can build something awesome that's
way better than if you just
incrementally improved whatever you were
doing from that point on so 3d printing
is so
out of a different field
that you could just leapfrog
the entire system of making things in
another country putting them on
some shipping container and shipping
them putting them on a truck
i mean
if you look at the amount of stuff you
would get rid of
that entire process
that's just insane how smart that is
that we're looking at that
all right
so kudos to
biden for that
um
so there's stories today and i think
everybody's a little confused i'm a
little confused by this too
but the news is reporting that
it's now clear that uh the u.s
intelligence people
helped ukrainians confirm the
that big
so the russian ship they got blown up
with a missile the moskva
so
we don't really want to be we the united
states we don't want to be seen as in
the war against russia
even though it's clear we're supporting
someone who's in the war with russia but
we you know we're trying not to blur
that line too much but why is it that
uh even the news on the left you know
the cnns are reporting this story it's a
major story
but it doesn't really it doesn't add
that much because it the the claim here
at least by america the claim is that uh
the united states helped
confirm the location that confirmed that
it was the ship they thought it was
but really the ukrainians had all the
intelligence they needed so it's like
barely made any difference you know so
we're trying to paint it as yeah yeah
we did a little confirming
but they have their own ability to do
stuff you know we didn't help them that
much now nobody believes that right
but whatever the united states is saying
about how much we are or are not helping
ukraine
is obviously more than that
it's obviously yeah we're we're helping
them with spotting and logistics not
logistics so much but you know all the
visual locating of stuff of course we're
helping them with that
do you think that that russia is reading
cnn to find out
if the us is helping ukraine
so i don't really know why
this story is out so it's a story about
the story i guess why is the story out
it feels like we're being primed for
something doesn't it
it's like uh we're being vaccinated for
something bigger
possibly
you know it
it's just the the oddity of this being a
story at the same time in multiple
places
uh is
a and the fact that it's not really a
story i guess that's what it is
it became a story out of nothing
when there's nothing to it actually
because we always assumed that didn't we
didn't we always assumed that the us was
at least a little bit involved
in the intelligence situation there and
so this would just be confirming that
the us is just a little bit involved in
the intelligence service
stuff
so it's not really a story
because it's everything that everybody
would have imagined was exactly the case
if they hadn't told us anything
so why is it a story and why is it
suddenly a story
and i'm not sure that there was enough
of a trigger in the news to make it a
story
it feels planted and it feels part of a
some kind of an operation i mean it just
feels like there's something behind this
being a story at the moment
as if somebody's trying to push us into
a bigger war with russia for example i'm
not saying that's the case
but it has that feel to it like oh
this doesn't feel right
all right
how many of you have followed my series
in dilbert about dave the new engineer
who is
portrayed visually to look exactly like
he's probably black
but he's decided to identify as white
and is revealed in the series that he
may be pranking the boss
so it's sort of a prank he won't
identify as black
and
uh the i told you it runs through
thursday but i've forgotten there's
actually a friday so friday is the
today's the last of that series
uh however it looks like that one didn't
give me any trouble at all
a number of newspapers didn't run it
uh but that you know doesn't cost me any
money or anything
and
however it looks like i'm going to have
a slightly larger problem with the one
that's upcoming
this one's not about dave this is a new
topic
in which uh i'll give you a little
advance on this
uh if it gets published
and it's looking kind of iffy at this
point
i'll be talking about that with my uh
editor today
um
if it gets published it would feature
wally
identifying as a birthing human
and
doing that so he could get some
you know benefits
so it would be
he would be clearly stating that he's
not actually a birthing person but he's
identifying as
now he would just and it would be clear
that he's just doing it to game the
system
now
i told you that i'm already in trouble
with the trans community because they
thought that the series about dave the
engineer was about trans but it wasn't
like it didn't even occur to me that
anybody would interpret it that way
so i'm already in trouble with the
community
for something i didn't do
like i literally didn't do had nothing
to do with anything in that topic
but i do have one that's a little closer
to their topic and now they're all
primed
so
kind of asking for it are they at this
point now again the way i treat the
topic is completely respectful in my
opinion
right in my opinion it's respectful
meaning that it doesn't make fun of
anybody
of any type it's literally about one guy
it's about a character named wally
who tries to use every you know every
mechanism to avoid work
that's it
but it's only about that
so it's about how people deal with deal
with the you know the texture of society
it's not about whether it's right or
wrong it's not about who's good or bad
it's not who's winning or losing it's
nothing it's literally about one
character who doesn't even exist
how much trouble am i going to get into
for doing a comic
about one character who doesn't even
exist
a lot
let me give you the landscape of my life
here
so at this point i will have the trans
community hating me
because they thought a comic that had
nothing to do with them was about them
all right that's number one so the tran
and by the way
you've watched me long enough to know is
there anybody who's a bigger supporter
of the lgbtq
community
than me
probably not
probably not you'd have to look pretty
hard to find somebody who's more
supportive of that community in
particular like
like in particular
is so much so that my audience often is
like hates me for it
right here's another one
if you were to google me
you would find out
incorrectly because it was fake news
that i had said something terrible about
women i'm not even going to get into the
details because it didn't really happen
so there's a story taken out of context
which if you see it out of context would
appear that i'm an incredible
women-hating sexist
which is exactly the opposite of
anything that's ever been in my head or
in my life
i was raised by a strong woman have a
strong woman as a sister
have you know most of my relationships
or with strong women of one type or
another
i don't really have
whatever it is that people imagine i
have in my head
right so now the trans people hate me
for something that didn't happen
uh women
hate me if they've googled me they hate
me for something again that literally
didn't happen
literally didn't happen
um
minorities hate me because of the fake
news about trump so to the degree that
i'm associated with
supporting trump
people think well then you also support
these other things like the fine people
comment no because that didn't happen
so there are a whole bunch of trump
hoaxes
that are that accrue to me
that are things that literally didn't
happen
okay
so now i've got trans-hating me for
something that didn't happen women hated
me for something that didn't happen
minori is hating me for something that
didn't happen with trump that accrues to
me
and here's the last one
a lot of conservatives are turned off to
me
because they believe i was pushing
vaccines
which also never happened
literally never happened
so i've actually
[Laughter]
so somebody somebody says i'm acting
like a victim
am i
i thought this was interesting is this
not interesting
i don't you find it interesting that my
entire
my entire public brand is 100
100
based on things that never happened
all of it
all of it is based on stuff that didn't
happen
every bit of it
is that not interesting i think that's
interesting
all right
um
it's hard to know what's interesting to
other people
uh but i suppose that's my job so i
should be i should know that shouldn't i
press on buddy craig says
we're gonna press on something that's
interesting to you all right so uh
people are up in arms because there's a
left-leaning group
that published the home addresses of
some of the
conservative justices supreme court
justices
and this would be so that people would
go protest at their homes
how alarming is that
compared to let's say january 6 because
everybody's going to compare it to
january 6 right hey if january 6 was so
bad
isn't this worse
well
i it's hard to be consistent with all of
this stuff so i'm going to try to be
consistent which is
uh
to the extent that anybody in either
group is doing something completely
legal
i guess free speech
if it's legal
right i guess i support it or i support
the right to do it that's different
but there is something terribly
republic wrecking about
going to the homes of the supreme court
somewhat uniquely
like way more than going to the home of
a politician which is bad enough
right i don't think anybody should be
going to anybody's home that's like
that's like way over the line
but for the supreme court it's way worse
in my opinion
because as i've often said the supreme
court is only it's the one thing we can
sort of almost agree on even though
we're not right
at least they have the credibility that
they show their work
you know scholars are going to be
pouring over it if it's wrong maybe
there'll be a chance to change it in the
future
so it is our most credible system even
though we're arguing about it at the
moment
so if you have people uh
perverting that in any way
that's the most dangerous thing that
could happen to our system
so yeah it's really dangerous i'm not
i'm not going to go so far to call call
it treason
like i feel like that's too far it's
just really bad judgment
and it's really bad patriotism
and it's also not the way to win
um
but you know
i don't think it works so well
on a group that knows they're going to
be doing controversial things
i doubt there are too many cowards in
the supreme court
probably not
and
they're they're appointed for life
so you know i've got a feeling that the
they won't be influenced
it's just all bad
it's just all bad
well meanwhile elizabeth warren is going
ballistic she's trying to get most of
the headlines here so i think she's
realized this could be her moment
like
elizabeth warren has been out of the
headlines for a long time hasn't she
she sort of you know will get a
get a quote or something but she's not
she's not really too relevant at the
moment
but then this issue comes up and she she
wants to get on video screaming louder
than anybody else is screaming
so that it becomes about her and she can
harness that energy nothing wrong with
that by the way if i said that like it
was a negative i would have said it as a
positive if trump did it right
it's real good technique to
attach yourself to something that
already has energy
so she finds something that already has
energy
the abortion question attaches herself
to it
and she did it well so
if i'm going to
evaluate her on technique
pretty good
now
i see a lot of you are saying oh it's
like a john dean moment where she looks
like a crazy person by screaming too
much
to which i say
not if you agree with her
she only looks like a crazy person if
you disagree with her if you agree with
her she's the most passionate
person then she's going to be fighting
on your side and whatever else so i
don't think it was a mistake i think it
was i think she
she probably pulled it off
yeah the howard dean thing was a mistake
but also because he was male
and because there was no topic
think of the difference
you're allowed to scream as loudly and
as crazy as you want
if the reason you're shouting
deserves it
and she's selling it as it deserves it
so i think she's making the sale howard
dean wasn't selling anything he was just
making noise to make noise and it just
looked silly
she's selling something that people are
buying so that's completely different
um
so
let's see
yeah jonathan turley was coming out
pretty strong strongly against uh
these protesting at the
justices house
and
yeah
he does a good job of explaining
all right there's a
two studies here that i think you should
be alerted to
so you know they're
we're seeing lots of data recently so
these are not brand new but in in the
recent couple weeks
we've seen a big ivermectin study we've
seen big study about the vaccinations
you know pfizer information and
separately other studies of vaccinations
and stuff like that and there's one
thing that we can conclude about all
ivermectin studies and all vaccination
studies and what is that
what is it we can conclude the one thing
we know for sure
about vaccinations and ivermectin
studies
is i'm not talking about the drug
talk about the studies what do we know
about all the studies
are they crap
no that's not what we know
that that's actually not what we know
believe it or not so i'm gonna fool you
because you thought i was gonna say all
the studies are crap
no it's worse than that
it's way worse than that
some of those studies might be right
you don't know which one
that's the problem
the problem is not that 100 of them are
crap the problem is you just can't tell
so here's the the one thing we know
the one thing we know is not whether
they're all crap we don't really know
that
the one thing we know is that they are
rorschach tests in which everybody will
only see what they want to see
we do know that
that's something we know
so the ivormectin study
and the people who think ivamectin
doesn't work say well there it is
biggest randomized controlled study says
it doesn't work and then all the people
who think it does work say um look at
the way they designed it it was
literally designed to fail
and here are our reasons and then they
show their work
and then i say
that well they have an argument
it's not that they don't have an
argument they show their work here's our
argument here's the dose here's what
would have made sense
is there a counter argument to that i
don't know
but that's where i go off the rails
so i end up uh
i end up defaulting to what i thought
was true in the first place so in other
words
it's like a rorschach test i look at the
ivormectin study and i just see what i
already thought was true
whatever that was
same thing with the vaccination studies
i'm seeing people tweeting all day well
now there's proof that the vaccinations
harmed you and then people look at the
same study and say well here's proof
that they worked
compared to getting covered
which is true i don't know
i don't have the skill to know that and
i don't know how i could tell
without having the skill myself i don't
know how i could ever know it the only
thing we know for sure is that everybody
sees what they want to see in the in in
the the science and that feels different
because i feel like we've gone to uh the
third layer
so like you know 20 years ago
if the science journal said it was true
and the scientists said it was true
we mostly thought it was true
and then it got to the point was oh wait
a minute
some of these studies are bogus actually
way too many maybe half of them
that got published shouldn't have been
published or they're not repeatable or
they can't be reproduced
right so then we went from oh science is
good to whoa
i guess we over trusted science
so you we've got to be careful
science might be right half the time
but if you do your own research
you can figure out which time they're
right
because humans the non-scientists can do
that that's what we thought
we used to believe that we could do a
deep dive
and we could figure out which of the
scientific studies were the good ones
now what do you think
i think we've gone to the next level of
awareness
the next level of awareness is
you can't tell which ones are real
you don't know who's lying
but you do know you're going to see what
you expected to see
that
ladies and gentlemen
is the golden age
welcome
it's about time
it took you a little while to get here
yeah you had to take the long way didn't
you
some of you are having an experience
right now
not all of you some of you
and you're realizing that you actually
took that path
you went from science probably right to
science ooh you got to really be careful
but if you do your own research you know
you can work it out too you can't do
your own research
that's not a thing you're just going to
see exactly what you wanted to see
but now you know it
now when you see what you wanted to see
you'll know it's not necessarily real
you'll just know you see it
you could look at these studies now and
say okay i see clearly
clear as day
yes or no doesn't matter what you say
but i see it clear as day and now for
the first time
for the first time
you can step outside of your own
perception
you could say you know that looks
exactly like that study is saying
something
but i don't know
i really don't know i really really
don't know
that
is where you needed to be
so if you weren't there until today
welcome
and
it's going to be a big deal you just
wait and see
um i saw a little bit by pete buddha
judge being
being quite persuasive
and here's how he was framing the i
guess the culture war
situation the disney situation the doce
gay stuff
and the way he says it is that the
the republicans have no answers
for the big problems and then he lists a
bunch of things he said you know they
have no answer for child care costs and
they have no answer for
the deficit and taxes it gives a bunch
of things that the
republicans have no answers for to which
i say
actually those were pretty good examples
they really don't have an answer for
health care that's true i say the same
thing
but he conveniently left out
all the things that they do have answers
for
because you know this
the surge in crime
talk to a republican
talk to a republican they actually have
answers to that
there are actually things you can do
to reduce crime
it's well understood
talk to a republican
about the border
do you think the republicans have any
solutions for the border yes they do yes
they do you might not like them it would
be reasonable
to say you don't like them but to say
that they don't have a solution that has
worked in the past would not be true
so
um i'm going to give boon judge a a plus
for persuasion
but of course
i see what i want to see in pete
budajudge
and the people who like him are going to
see what they want to see
so does it matter that he's uh that what
he says makes sense or doesn't make
sense or he leaves something out no not
really it doesn't matter it only matters
if it was persuasive to the people he
wanted to persuade and he's pretty good
at it
and so his uh his take is that the
republicans are creating these fake
targets and and demonizing people like
the trans community because they don't
have any real arguments
and i thought to myself
okay it's not true
because he's you know selectively
picking the things that they don't have
arguments for i'll give him that but
he's really good at it
he's pretty good at it
i i do think he could be president
i'm not i'm not endorsing him don't
worry don't worry i'm not endorsing him
i'm just saying that
he needs to be seasoned he's not ready
i always say he shouldn't be president
now
he's he's just not there
but he has the ability he has the
natural ability
to figure out what it is he's not doing
right yet and then get there
you know i think he can obama his way to
the next level
now
don't be angry at me i'm not i'm not
suggesting he showed or should not be
president i'm just saying that his his
uh skill level
is higher than most of the people on the
left
and he only has to be the best one on
the left am i right
wait
that sounded confusing
he only needs to be the best one on the
left
because that's all it takes to be
president
you know unless he's running against you
know
a uh
a power like trump or something like
that but that's all it would take you
only have to be better than the left and
that you could argue that that bar is
low because their bench isn't very good
and i don't think that that's partisan
to say that the republicans have a
better bench
do you feel that that is subjectively
is that too subjective
if just i think both sides say that
right
because you can go i think you can go
three or four deep on the republican
side and still have a good candidate
but on the left it's a little bit harder
because kamala and biden are you know
not so strong
all right
china wants to
increase its military presence abroad
nothing to worry about there
oh my god
what would happen if china ended up with
military bases everywhere that they have
economic interests
and more influence than the united
states because it would take take that
to happen
i don't know
it's pretty scary stuff
um
it does seem that demographic wise and
just number wise eventually
we live in the chinese world right
because they're just so many
so many of them if they spread out and
spread their influence
spread their money
and continue succeeding as they have
uh i don't know how we don't live in a
china dominated world eventually i mean
300 years from now but
not right away
all right
the uh
the most interesting story of the day i
don't know why i waited so long for that
is that um there's a new book out by
espers it was aspers he would he had
been in the trump administration and
said that he was secretary of defense
right
and uh he reports in his new book that
trump had asked him about
sending some patriot missiles in to
destroy
destroy the drug making
operations in mexico
and the news treated it like a that was
such a crazy thing
now
can i ask you a question
those of you who've watched me for a
while and also watched
the news in general for a while
before you read about this
was there anybody else in the public
besides me
who was saying
let's drone the fentanyl
labs in mexico
was i the only one saying that in public
i think i said it a lot
but i don't remember seeing anybody else
say it
do you have any memory of anybody saying
it before i said it
not anybody in the public public eye
but name a name if you can think of
anybody because i want to give credit
where credit would be due
well okay so it's blowing my mind a
little bit because as of today
now that uh trump said that uh or
reportedly said it you know you have to
take it with a grain of salt
and i think it was it was
phrased as a question
my understanding was not that he ordered
him to do it or said you must do this my
understanding he said would it be
feasible
essential
and then esper said now and then it
didn't happen
okay
i'm not sure that that's a
uh
there's something missing in the story
isn't there
the part that's missing in the story is
why isn't this a good idea
because i don't think that's even been
mentioned
and
obviously there are risks
you know obviously we know the whole
situation what it was likely to happen
but i've never heard anybody explain the
risks
because to me it doesn't seem like if
the if mexico is owned by the cartels
and you bomb the cartels
i just can't see a moral legal or
even the homeland security risk in doing
that it just seems like we would
we would show them that having an
industry that kills 50 000 amer
americans per year is going to get you
 killed
they would just send the message
yeah
you can keep sending fentanyl to the
united states and kill 50 000 americans
yeah and i know it's the addict's fault
you don't have to make that argument i
get it i get it the addicts are the ones
that take the drugs i get it
but
that doesn't make them innocent
does it
they're not more innocent because
somebody else should have done something
different
so
i i think a lot of people at least on
twitter are saying uh
why don't we
take out the the fentanyl labs
why don't we
now
now the first thing you're going to say
to yourself is that what difference
would it make because it would only take
them a week to spin up a new lab
right
and you'd be right
do you know also doesn't stop murder
putting people in jail
it doesn't stop crimes
so why do we have jails
what's the point of a jail
if it doesn't stop crime
maybe slows it down a little bit but it
doesn't really stop it right
so
the our entire system depends on
punishing people that don't completely
stop what they're doing
right so you don't not do it
because it's not 100 fix nothing works
that way you do it to create uh friction
to make it harder to do it
and then you just keep squeezing
and bombing you know literally bombing
the labs would only be one thing it's
not the one thing you do
you know just one other things you do
so if you just keep squeezing in every
possible way you can squeeze well maybe
you can reach the point where
there's less fentanyl coming out
but i wouldn't look at it as you know
one act
does that completely solve the problem
or not no
no it doesn't work like that you would
just put pressure everywhere you could
put pressure and if it were me i would
make those labs explode if we knew where
they were
and then somebody says well what about
the civilian deaths
to which i say civilians at a fentanyl
lab
are those the deaths you're worried
about
if somebody takes their children to work
at the fentanyl
lab
i'm not going to call that my problem
i'm definitely not going to call that my
problem i mean that would be tragic
but it's also
it's adult business
everything about this are adult
decisions
if you can't handle an adult decision
then don't be part of the conversation
an adult decision does mean killing
people
accidentally intentionally
no way around it
so
yeah i would take out the fentanyl labs
if there's a way to find them and know
for sure that there were their fence in
the labs i would make them all explode
definitely but it's just not the only
thing i would do
all right
let me ask you this um
in the comments
in the comments
would you agree with taking out the
fentanyl labs in mexico not necessarily
with a specific patriot missile could be
drones could be special operations
whatever whatever works i don't know i'm
no expert
so on the locals platform uh
90 yeses
on youtube
so far all yeses
yeah
now isn't that interesting
that um now of course you're
you're probably you know right-leaning
audience
for the most part so that's not too
surprising
but the way the news treats it is is as
if you don't even have to debate how
crazy it is
to which i would only add this one thing
no you do need to debate how
crazy that is you do need to
you don't get to say it's crazy and walk
away no you if you're doing that
you don't get to say it's crazy and walk
away you better stay you're going to
need to tell me why this isn't a good
idea it might not be
by the way i could easily be convinced
it wouldn't take much to convince me
just somebody who knows what they're
talking about
laying out the reasons and the risks and
then i'd say and say oh this risk looks
bigger than the benefit
don't do it
but if you're not even going to engage
in the conversation
well i'm not going to take you seriously
i'm going to take seriously the person
who asked the question
would it work if we if we
missile attack the labs
that's that was the right question
even if the answer was hell no
because of x y and z
it was still the right question
and boy do i respect trump for asking it
now he couldn't get enough support to do
it
and i think he would need the support of
his you know his top people
but it was the right question and i have
to i have to say
i'm going to slightly revise
my opinion of trump's performance on
fentanyl
because i'd given him something like a
d-minus
because nothing changed it got worse
right
but you know at least he made it a
little bit more of a national
conversation
he tried to push china a little bit but
it didn't work
and so i was i was basically he was this
close to a completely failing grade
but now that i know how serious he was
about it that he was willing to risk war
with mexico
to kill these
i have a lot more respect for him and
i wish he had been successful
at something with fentanyl and he wasn't
so i'm not going to lose sight of that
but at least he was serious about it
he was serious about it and he obviously
was willing to take a risk that would
have been a big risk to himself
personally
let me say that again
he would have known that was a big risk
to him politically of course
like you know he would have hoped it
went his way but he obviously would have
known the size of the risk
so if trump was privately
taking a risk that big
to himself
privately
to himself
that was a personal risk
even asking the question was a personal
risk
so now my respect for trump on this
topic i'm being very specific here is
now vastly increased
because we know he was willing to take a
personal risk to get it done
it's hard to ask for more than that
from a politician right he didn't get it
done and that matters
but he
if this book is correct he was willing
to take a personal risk to get it done
on top of the you know the country risk
etc which is a separate conversation
all right uh did i discuss this topic
with trump i did not
no
i did not
um
only only in the limited sense that i do
it publicly so i've talked about
going after the labs publicly
he fought like hell against the deep
state
yeah i don't know how successful that
was either
that's right hillary wanted to drone
assange
you know but you know i'm going to give
hillary the same
the same let's say benefit of a doubt
that trump that i give trump
if if hillary in her capacity as you
know one of the leaders was simply
asking the question you know could we
drone this person now i don't think he
should be droned
that would be a horrible crime in my
opinion
but
i'm never going to get on somebody for
asking the questions
right
so
you know i i just don't think that's a
standard that we should appreciate
you know the the standard should be
we'll look at their decisions not the
questions they ask to get there
that's
that's not how you want to judge anybody
you don't want to see the first draft
all right
um
assange did not kill millions
true
uh
drone yeah
all right that's all i got for today
um i'm gonna go do something else
and uh
thank you for all your good thoughts
about my cat
uh very much appreciated
and i will talk to you
