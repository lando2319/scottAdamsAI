and welcome to the highlight of
civilization it's coffee with Scott
Adams it's better than the World Cup
it's bigger than the war in Ukraine is
more important than climate change
and you you amazing people you've made
it here to watch it live and or recorded
not bad either
and if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that no one's
ever seen before all you need is a cup
of a glass of tanker Chelsea Stein a
camptene Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill in with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure that
dopamine in the day thing makes
everything better except the World Cup
if you don't like soccer but it might
make that better it's called the
simultaneous ship it happens now go
oh yeah yeah
you if you're not a member of the locals
subscription service
you missed the dirty sip that happened
earlier
the dirty sip was completely feral
it was wet
it was nasty
and it was perfect but for the regular
public we just do the
standard standard simultaneous step and
that's good too that's good too
um the World Cup is on literally right
now the same time I went live zero to
zero it's one minute and it's Argentina
versus France now I'm quite aware that
many of my viewers could not care less
about soccer
but I'm going to make a little pitch
why this one's different first of all
it's the finals it's the World Cup it's
the biggest sporting event
in human civilization
it happens to have
two of the best players of all time
on opposite teams
Lionel Messi
the now aging Superstar best player of
all time probably Maybe not maybe he's
in his last World Cup and he's leading
in in ghost Court well actually he's
tied with the other the other guy mabopy
I don't know if I pronounce his name
right so France has this guy mabappy
who's like 23
and he's up against the best that's ever
played who's 37 his last last one
and they're both fighting for the the
Golden Boot award now the Golden Boot is
the player who's the best player
in the biggest tournament
of the biggest sport
in human civilization
in other words whichever one of the two
of them win this there's nothing higher
in the in human human Endeavors I mean
you know you'd have to go to like the
Nobel Prize to find something that's
like similar to this and their neck and
neck five goals a piece
the tiebreaker is assists
a message one ahead and assists but if
they tie an assist and they tie in in
goals the tie breaker is how many
minutes they played
which way do you think it goes
do you think the tiebreaker is who
played the most minutes or who played
the fewest which which would you which
way is the fewest because whoever played
the fewest
scored the most goals in the smallest
amount of time
do you see a problem with that method
or he's only 21 somebody says I read 23
though
do you see a problem with that
it's going to put the coach in an
awkward position right the coach of both
teams
because
they might have to take out their best
player
so that their best player wins the
Golden Boot
but in order for to make their best
player win the Golden Boot
they might have to take out their best
player so he plays fewer minutes
that that's like the worst system I've
ever heard by life the coach is actually
gonna have to choose between giving
Lionel Messi maybe maybe we don't know
this but it could come down to this
would they choose between giving Lionel
Messi the greatest player of all time
his Just Desserts of his last one or
winning the game or winning the game
those might be their two choices
oh my God would I would not want to make
that choice
wow
but because of soccer it'll probably
come down to penalty kicks which will
you know in in American culture that
makes the whole thing ridiculous
uh now I'll give you I'm going to give
you one more
um one more minor argument just hold on
I'll be done
of why even if you don't like soccer
you should watch a little bit of this
and here's why
it's the best players in the world
and normally if you see the best
offensive player try to score a goal
against the best defensive players you
know what happens
the defensive players win almost every
time
because the best player in the world
can't even get past the best defender
you know that right just the best you
could take the best players and they
they can't get past a Defender who's you
know in place
with maybe two exceptions
and those two are plagued if you haven't
seen Lionel Messi
the one of the shortest players I think
in soccer
going right through the best defenders
in the world like like they're not
they've never played soccer before
the other best players can't do that
there are only a few people who have
ever been able to do it to go to just
like walk around somebody who's right in
front of them like they're not even
there you have to see it right because
here's why you don't like soccer
if you don't if you don't like soccer
it's because you turned it on and you
saw a bunch of people trying to score
and then they were easily stopped by the
other team right hey he's got the ball
he oh they took it away okay now he's
going to the goal well okay they took it
away and that's all it is soccer is 99
hey it looks like he's gonna no he's not
doing anything
it looks like a good run no the defense
got it
and then you watch Messi so just watch
the one player don't watch the whole
game just watch one player watch what
happens when he touches the ball it's
not soccer he's not even playing the
same game so that's what you have to say
because this will be the only time maybe
in your lifetime maybe the only time
you'll get to see the best player who
ever lived at the biggest game and the
biggest moment that's ever existed for
this
so so watch greatness right don't watch
it for soccer
don't watch it for soccer if that's not
your thing just watch that one player
figure out what's his number
so who knows Messi's number I don't know
why I don't know that
now you'll see it in the comments all
right enough of that uh I call this next
segment at least I don't live in Canada
he's number 10. all right look for
number 10 and just watch him he'll you
will be blown away it's just not like
soccer
all right at least I don't live in
Canada
uh here's a real story from today so a
few years ago 2017 there was a
two billionaires you know a couple who
were discovered uh dead at home and
here's the description of how they were
discovered
uh in in December of 2017 a realtor
giving a tour of the couple's Toronto
Mansion around midday discovered their
bodies
fully dressed
beside their indoor basement swimming
pool
they were semi-seated side by side with
belts tied around their necks and
attached to the railings of the indoor
pool
and the police ruled it uh double
suicide
they were found with belts died around
their necks
fully closed side by side
with the other side of the belt attached
to their pool
equipment there
and so the police said well this doesn't
look suspicious
this is obviously a double suicide
because you know
I don't know if you've ever planned a
double suicide
but a really good way to go is to
strangle yourselves with belts while
you're sitting next to each other
I guess that was their idea a couple of
billionaires a couple of billionaires
decided hey let's strangle ourselves
with belts
while we're sitting next to our basement
pool
and we'll see how it goes first all
right start
how you doing over there
I'm doing okay it's gonna take a while
I think we got bubbles there are you
close let's try to time this
oh
I mean seriously
you know we we sometimes criticize the
quality of police work in this country
you've probably heard some people maybe
complain a little bit about you know the
little errors or maybe a little
corruption or something in the police
police
well say it with me at the same time
unless you're Canadian
you can repeat this at the same time
at least I don't live in Canada
that's all just make yourself feel
better sorry Canada we love you we love
you Canadians but your government is
a source of uh mockery for us it's not
that ours is so good it's not you know
it's not like I can throw stones in my
glass house but hey at least I don't
live in Canada
at least if I'm discovered with a belt
around my neck next to my indoor pool
I don't have one but if I had one
it's good to know that the police will
solve that solve that mystery
looks like they killed themselves
well the New York Times has a long
article which I found
quite interesting but who knows what's
true anymore can we agree I have to say
this before every Ukraine statement can
we agree that a hundred percent of news
out of Ukraine
is sketchy
and propaganda
all good on that so when I tell you what
the New York Times said you don't need
to interrupt me and say Scott
don't believe the New York Times
right everybody knows that like that is
that is
stipulated
yes stipulated
all right but anyway here's what New
York Times reports
that the soldiers were um
poorly trained had only shot weapons a
few times
didn't have many bullets they were sent
over there with no training no food they
had maps from the 60s they were shelling
their own people
apparently they've wanted Russian cyber
attacks on Ukraine
turns out Russia does not have a vaunted
Cyber attack group apparently because
they could they couldn't do
so remember when you thought oh Russia
is going to take down all of Ukraine
with her with her computing they're
gonna be hitting those keyboards and
they're going to crash all the Ukraine
turns out none of that was true
it was it was all now you're
saying they did meaning that they had
some successes overall
it didn't make a difference
overall would you agree are you fact
checking me on that
yeah you're saying don't believe the New
York Times
well I haven't seen any reports that
Ukraine was
Ukraine was greatly disadvantaged by the
cyber attacks
yeah
I I don't it looks like maybe Russia
doesn't have that much capability
so
uh let's see what else they had no
command Communications
you know terrible command structure it
would take 72 hours to get approval to
attack something
so the did you wonder why the ukrainians
didn't lose Air Supremacy
has anybody wondered about that wasn't
that like the biggest mystery it's like
are you really telling me that Russia
doesn't have Air Supremacy over Ukraine
well it turns out they could have
in other words they had the they had the
assets that they should have but they
were so incompetent they couldn't put it
together and it would take them so long
to attack something
that the ukrainians would just move
their planes
and then the Russians would attack
two days late so they'd bomb they'd bomb
where the assets were two days ago they
had such poor
poor uh what would you call the
logistics and command and control and
what's the other word where you can see
the battlefield what would that be
called
operational knowledge or something
Recon Recon Intel yeah the Recon and
their Intel were apparently terrible
so not only did Russia not control the
sky
but they couldn't even see what was on
the ground which is weird
are you telling me they didn't have
satellites and spy planes
so so maybe you should doubt this part
of the story but that's what we're being
told operational awareness situational
awareness okay all of those things
um they couldn't correct when they were
making mistakes they had terrible
Battlefield strategy and and we have
more more evidence that Putin was
entirely lied to
or shut off from good information from
his subordinates
uh and here's the funny part do you know
why the Russian military is not prepared
but Putin thought that they were
what should do you know is there an
obvious reason to that
Putin thought he had a solid military
turns out it was just completely gutted
and and falling apart
it's because the uh all the money that
Putin was putting into the military was
being stolen
so Putin thought he was putting a lot of
money into his military and when he
asked his generals how it was going what
do you think they told them
when did the general say you know to be
honest all that money you put into uh my
military got stolen
so we actually don't have any tanks
nobody's been trained and if you start a
war we don't have any bullets
do you think that they told Putin that
probably not
see here's a little management advice
for you
if somebody comes in and you and the
manager says
um how's it going
and the subordinate says well to be
honest it's not going well
and then the manager
kills you
and they put somebody else in he said
all right how's it going and the new guy
says it's really hard to solve this
problem we're a little underfunded and
honestly it's not working out at all
so he kills them
third guy replacement comes in manager
says how's it going
third guy says great
yeah nailing it
everything's going great oh my God could
we win a war oh my God you could start a
war with anybody anybody we are so ready
for war we just want a war could we
please have a war uh we have so many
bullets
I wouldn't know what to do with all the
bullets we've got a storage problem all
of our high-tech expertise and and and
our cyber stuff I mean we're bristling
with capabilities
don't kill me please don't kill me don't
kill me
and then Putin listens to that and he
goes
finally
I've got some good management
this guy's killing it that's exactly
what I'm looking for
I'm looking for putting some money into
it and getting results you I'm promoting
you to Four Star General you're in
charge of everything now good work for
you
that's exactly what happened like that's
the hyperbolic version but that's
actually what happened
let me summarize
it was a Dilbert problem
it was literally a Dilbert problem
it was people who couldn't talk honestly
to their boss
that's it
that one problem
is all of their problems like every
problem they have is really just that
one problem they couldn't tell the truth
to the boss without getting killed
now
to me that seems like the Fatal flaw of
dictators
I I feel as though uh chairman she in
China is having exactly the same problem
what do you think
do you think she is getting honesty from
his people
that's a big problem now of course we've
been watching you know all of the
corruption and horribleness in the
United States but what's different about
it here
what's different about the United States
and our massive corruption this seems to
touch every part of our society
we're digging it out
we're we're like crazed you know feral
animals we're like we're like is that
corruption over there
right we're ripping it out by
the root
Elon Musk spent 44 billion dollars to
make a point
right Americans we will kill you
if you do that to us we will stop at
nothing to rip you out of your job and
 get you out of there and fix it
right so Americans have this
productive self-destruction
I'm coming for you
you know you'd better get out of my
 way if you're going to do this
just continuous attitude
so that we can we can break and fix at
the same time
break it and fix it break it and fix it
so we're continually breaking destroying
Reinventing breakings growing whereas
the Russians are just
is something wrong
I everything's fine okay I don't have to
do anything right because everything's
fine
there's no way that that can compete
there's no way that the dictators can
compete with our perpetually
self-destructive productive system we
have a system that will beat their
system in the long run every time
because their system will always fail
because you can't tell the truth to the
person who makes the decisions every
time
there's no way to fix that is there
it's just it's just a problem with
addicting I suppose if you had some
amazing uh dictator who was really more
about the people than himself but I
don't see that ever happening
yeah
anyway
um
it it's hard for us I think it's hard
for Americans in particular to see when
things are going right
because we are we're critics by nature
maybe everybody is but somehow our
system supports it better and
and we're always going after each other
and we're going after every problem we
see and we do it in public we we fight
it in public it's like a continuous cage
match
but
here's a little thing I tell you all the
time there's a there's a secret
that America consistently uses that we
don't call out often enough
and the secret is this
if we can't agree on what to do
we can find a way to agree
who made the decision
that's that's the magic of our system
because if you're if your problem is
trying to agree you can never solve that
you'll never solve abortion we're not
going to be on the same side
so abortion is the best example abortion
is the ultimate life and death question
right
it's the ultimate life and death
question I mean you can't get more
severe in your life and death questions
than that now of course that's the whole
point some people say it's not life but
that's what makes it a topic
now have you noticed that the country
has not torn itself together over that
question
they have not and the only reason is
that we can hate the decision as long as
we respect that it was made within a
system that has to deal with tough
questions and it just has to make a
decision
so as long as you respect let's say the
Supreme Court
you can put up with a decision you just
do not like
right now of course there was great
protests and stuff when when Roe versus
Wade was modified shall we say and
but has the country been overthrown
no because I think that the left hates
the decision and then everybody
complains about the legitimacy of the
court but it's not real
I don't think that's real
I think that the average
oh Messi's getting ready to shoot
are you already okay the best player in
the world is going against a goalkeeper
and it's a it's a say shot and
of course let's go again
Lionel Messi just took the lead
to win the Golden Boot
in the biggest
competition
in the history of civilization
of course he made it there wasn't really
by the way if you're a goalkeeper
if you're a goalkeeper and you look up
and you see the light Leonel Messi
looking at that ball getting ready to
kick a set piece
does Scott believe in America
or does he want to change
believing in America is wanting
continuous change
that that's my macro point
yeah believing in America
is believing in a continuous process of
Destruction and reinvention so yes I
believe in I believe in America
all right the other the other reason
Argentina versus France in the world cup
is special
uh is that they play Beautiful
they both these two teams have a
beautiful style of play just for that
alone it's worth watching
all right
you know there wasn't much happening
today but a lot of it was funny on
on Twitter all right so here's here's
the thing that happened on Twitter
you all know Larry Elder right
conservative
Larry Elder tweets if Adolf Hitler Mao
zi Tung and Elon Musk were walking down
the street and you gave an American
Lefty a gun with two bullets he'd put
both an Elon Musk
I don't know
Elon Musk responded to this tweet
that the Lefty would put two bullets in
Elon Musk Elon Musk says and miss both
times and miss both times
which is a very funny Lefty a joke out
of love all right that if he gave him a
gun they saw they still couldn't hit
their target
uh
but then it gets funnier because fact
checked me that Elon musk's mother is
May right May musk that's the name of
his mother right and may must uh
saw the Larry Elder tweet that was you
know talking about pulling putting
bullets in her son and you know demanded
demanded that he be removed from Twitter
so now Elon musk's mother
is weighing in on Twitter management
saying that Larry Elder should be
removed
for a joke
and the joke the the nature of the joke
was Pro Elon Musk you know Larry Elder
just put it in a funny way but any any
reasonable interpretation of that
is that Larry Elder was Pro Musk and the
anti the left but his mother you know
again in the same way I defended Elon
Musk when he went a little extreme when
his child was endangered
and I allow that
yeah if your child is endangered and you
get a little extreme for a little while
okay okay and and if you're Elon musk's
mother
and you see a joke that involves putting
you know
doing something bad to your son even
though it's a joke
can we allow her reaction was fine
can we allow that yeah right yeah Mom's
reaction was right on right on point
mom should actually act and she did so I
respect that and then I respect this
Elon Musk responds to his mom asking for
him to cancel somebody on Twitter and it
just does he just says it's fine it's
fine
is that the perfect
adult son talking to his mother
like that captured every adult son
talking to their mother does it it's
fine it's fine
I love that
so you already know that uh musk ran a
poll on Twitter to ask if he should
reinstate the band journalists who had
mentioned or or appointed to information
about his location
and 59 said reinstate them now so I
guess most of them are back uh Aaron
rupar is back
so rupar is back
um but here's the funny part
so Keith Olbermann started tweeting from
an account that he uses for dog rescue
stuff so to his credit
have I ever taught you that if you can't
say something good about your critics
uh you maybe you're not being objective
if it's true that Keith olberman has a
second Twitter account
that is dedicated to rescuing dogs well
okay I like that about
can can I be allowed to say that my
greatest critic has a good point about
him if he's rescuing dogs
okay
but of course it's being characterized
as uh tweeting from his dog's Twitter
account which is way funnier than what
it actually is which is a you know dog
rescue account
but was even so olberman is not back and
there's nothing funnier than the fact
that musk didn't bring old women back
and and then then musk mocks them on
Twitter for tweeting for I think most
said something like uh there's nothing
funnier than uh olberman tweeting from
his dog's account
[Laughter]
oh again that's not exactly what was
happening it wasn't his dog's account it
was a rescued dog cacao but it's much
funnier if you say it that way tweeting
from his dog's account
oh my God
uh and then I guess uh this
uh Washington Post Tech reporter Taylor
Lorenz
uh got suspended and she's not sure why
but she's a famous doctor
a legend right so I alleged that doesn't
make sense of his public but uh so she's
she's doxed people got caught for it uh
I don't know I I have mixed feelings
I have mixed feelings on one hand
you know freedom of speech is more
important than anybody's personal beef
so you don't want to see a billionaire
using his personal situation to ban
something akin to free speech but not
really because it's a private company
so
I have mixed feelings my mixed feelings
are that banning these two individuals
is just funny
[Laughter]
so I support it because it's funny not
not because not because they did
something that deserved it I mean maybe
they did maybe they didn't that's just
subjective but I definitely support it
from the perspective that is funny
now to me the perfect situation would be
that he eventually reverses him
that he eventually maybe in a week or
something because I think that they
should have a right to have their voices
heard and in the dominant way that
people communicate in their business
so you know maybe it's just sort of a
funny time out
where they get a little extra attention
you get a little extra attention and
nobody's really hurt by it right a few
weeks off of Twitter is going to be good
for you in fact Elon Musk tweeted that
uh so taking some time off from Twitter
is probably good for your health
have you ever seen anybody own a product
that he's trying to monetize and tell
you maybe you should spend less time
with it
who does that I mean every part of what
he says is at least funny on some level
like he never says anything that's not
funny on some level if you if you if you
struggle with it
all right
so that's hilarious uh but I even I
would support bringing them back and as
you know
olberman has been brutal to me
um
but he deserves a platform
he deserves the platform
must says that Twitter has removed the
ability to see which device a tweet
comes from
so you wouldn't know if it came from
Android or an iPhone now
are you happy about that
that feels like a good change does it
because you feel a little bit safer
the point is that anything that
identified your device could be used to
identify you I guess
so it's just a small little fig leaf or
a little extra privacy I'm not sure if
anybody's ever really private but it
feels good feels good it's directionally
correct wouldn't you say it it might be
dumb in terms of whether it makes any
difference but it's a directionally
correct signaling you know the right
right frame of mind kind of thing I like
that even if it's not you know super
important
but
correct me if I'm wrong
but watching the journalists on the left
treat musk's children as if they're
expendable
which is what I saw
did you did you read it that way that
the journalists who were you know
directly or indirectly doxing musk's
location once they knew that his
children would be put at risk
because that's real I mean of course his
children would be at risk
once they knew that that never bothered
them
did you see anybody on the left say you
know this is really
this is really dangerous you don't put
children in danger
I didn't see anybody do that
the most obvious human reaction to it
would be well let's make sure we protect
the children you know whatever you
adults are doing let's keep the kids out
of this and and this is this is too
close to danger to the kids
but I feel like they cemented their
brand as the child endangerment party
and the Republicans have sealed their
brand now
musk is not a republican but you know in
the larger context of all the other
stories
I feel like we now have a very clear
parent party and a child endangerment
party
the child endangerment party
um
is very consistent
very consistent
yeah all right
uh speaking about Free Speech Adam
Schiff the most famous liar in the
Western World tweeted uh
Elon Musk calls himself a free speech
absolutist to justify turning a blind
eye to hatred and bigotry on Twitter but
when journalists report unfavorable news
they are banned without warning the
Devotion to free speech is apparently
not that absolute but the hypocrisy is
that's Adam Chef the world's most
renowned liar
how many lies were in this one tweet
all right that's one short tweet how
many lies I counted two
right let's call them out uh he says
that musk calls himself a free speech
absolutist to justify turning a blind
eye to the hatred and bigotry
do you think that Musk uh do you think
that Adam Schiff can read the inner
thoughts of Elon Musk and see the never
expressed opinion
that the real the real point of it all
is so that there can be more hatred and
bigotry on Twitter
So Adam Schiff is saying that Elon
musk's real goal is to get some extra
you know hatred and bigotry on Twitter
that is the most ridiculous lie
so that's one lie
and then he goes when journalists report
unfavorable news they are banned is that
what happened
was pointing to the location where his
children could be endangered by that
information was that uh unfavorable news
well I
I suppose it was unfavorable news
all right I'm told something's going to
happen I guess I'm watching on a delay
oh there we go
Argentina 2-0
all right I'm sorry if I'm ruining for
you if anybody else is recorded I guess
I should apologize but there's no way
you're not going to know that they
scored you know I don't think you keep
that secret
all right well it might be over
two two zero in the world cup that might
be enough probably
all right
um
now that you know that Twitter
was a biased machine
what do you think about Google search
and YouTube and
Facebook
do you think if we if somebody dug in
there they'd find exactly the same
behavior
Maybe
exactly the same behavior
well here's a hint uh
Joe Pollock ran was talking about
breitbara had an article
the other day talking about Trump did a
video in which he did a direct
specific unambiguous
disavowing of anti-Semitism and Nick
Fuentes
set it directly no no ambiguity no
hesitation boom I I totally reject all
this
what did the left say
why did it take you so long
I I don't mind that comment
I don't mind I don't mind criticisms
that are accurate why did it take you so
long but what do I always say about that
what do I what do I always say about the
why'd you take so long criticism
everything good
should have happened faster everything
everything good could have and should
have happened faster there's no
exception it's like the universal
criticism of anything good it's like
you've run out of bad things about it so
now I'm saying oh yeah it's good but
could have been sooner like everything
could have right what couldn't have been
sooner I can't think of anything
all right
but did you know that if you were to
search for that Breitbart story about
Trump disavowing anti-Semitism that
Google search would not give it to you
it just won't give it to you
so the most important
update to a very important headline
story Google hid
and they did it obviously
they did it unambiguously
you could just check for yourself
now I think it's related to the fact
that they suppress Breitbart in general
so they've got their little argument
that Breitbart did X bad things
according to them so they can suppress
them forever I guess
even if they break important news
doesn't matter
so
I don't know if DuckDuckGo is better I I
can't confirm that
uh Google's more influential than
Twitter
is that true Google is more influential
than Twitter that could be a jump ball
Twitter's smaller
by far
but they seem to influence the
influencers
more than Google influences the public
and Twitter influences the influencers
who influence the public so I think
Twitter is more about the narrative and
Google is more about just hiding stuff
does that make sense
Google is hiding and surfacing different
stuff which probably has the effect of
creating a narrative
but it's it's because they're surfacing
people have already created the
narrative because they were already on
Twitter
so I I have a feeling that Twitter is
the tale that Wags the Google search
indirectly
yeah and of course Google is playing
with the covet information as well
so
that's shocking
um here's the most predictable thing in
the world now that pretty much everybody
from the medical community to addicts on
the street know that
various psychedelics from LSD to MDMA to
psilocybin from mushrooms that they
probably have an amazing therapeutic
mental health benefit
now it's it's becoming clear more and
more clear so what would you do if you
were a big Pharma
and you saw the that it totally works
and it's free
it's not free but it's like practically
free like a head of LSD
anybody can afford
you know unlike Health Care
anybody can afford a head of LSD I'm not
recommending it by the way if anybody's
watching this I don't recommend illegal
drugs all right just to be clear I would
never recommend you take an illegal drug
I don't do that
um
but people were and they they had access
to it and probably helped a lot of
people so what do you think they're
going to do
well apparently they've shown their hand
they're going to create uh improved
versions
so they'll start with the fact that
these various psychedelics who work and
then they'll make the approved version
and then what will happen to the illegal
versions
they will stay illegal
so that they can tell you that the
illegal versions will kill you but
they've made a An approved legal version
that they've tested in their oh so
believable tests and this is the safe
one
they're going to steal from you
the most important medical asset
in the history of human civilization
and they're going to steal it from you
right in front of you and they're going
to make it their own and then they're
going to charge you a thousand dollar a
dose
now we're watching it happen right in
front of us and there probably nothing
you can do well I suppose you could
always just have illegal drugs but
now we're America
so there is a certain transparency to
this isn't it like you could just read
the story and and you know the story
right there's not much mystery to it at
this point
so here we are
we're Americans and We complain like
crazy
can we change this
I don't know
this is going to be a tough one because
the farm industry is pretty powerful
they've got the the news industry in
their pocket
we might end up working with the cartels
just to beat our own
uh
oh my God that's real
do you realize I'm going to have to
start using the Mexican cartels for my
health care
like actually
like actually not joking
I'm going to look at the I'm going to
look at big Pharma
and they're offering and I'm going to
look at the Mexican cartels and the
product that they're offering
which one am I going to take
I'm gonna take the cartels product
probably now I don't think that they do
a lot with psychedelics I don't think
they're making money on that so I'm you
know this is hyperbole but I'm not wrong
that if you got your weed from the
cartel
and you got your vaccination from Big
Pharma which one did you a favor
I don't know
I actually don't know
like legitimately I can't tell the
difference
so if you say that the medical community
is better than uh the cartels I would
say that's not demonstrated
done talk psychedelics I'm out
what
you're mad at me for talking about
psychedelics
on what basis
that you're you're disagreeing with the
entire medical community and everybody
who hates the medical community you
disagreeing with the entire world
yeah fentanyl's the the problem not the
psychedelics
um
Paul Graham had a funny tweet if you
don't know Paul Graham
is one of the Gods of the startup world
so considered one of the smart smartest
people
who knows about tech and that world so
you have to know how smart he is to
understand the tweet and he says I used
to think oh he's talking about the
tweets
that he sees a lot on on Twitter so
people use this form of a tweet they say
I used to think whoever the person is
was smart then I discovered that he
disagrees with me about whatever the
issue is
and I realized he couldn't be he
couldn't be smart because no one who
disagrees with me about this political
issue whatever it is could be smart
and then I was asked on Twitter
if I could come up with a name for this
Behavior
the behavior is I used to think you were
smart but now that you disagree me with
me on this one thing obviously I was
wrong and you're dumb
what would you call that
so I called it narcissistic loser think
because I don't think anybody writes
that tweet unless they're a narcissist
let us look at the Tweet again and you
tell me if it could be anything but a
narcissist
now if you had a problem with somebody's
opinion
what would be the most standard way to
approach it I don't like your political
opinion on this thing standard way to
approach it oh well you may have
forgotten this point
or you seem to be undervaluing this
variable or were you aware of X or have
you seen this new study
those are the sort of things an honest
normal mentally healthy person would say
if you're a narcissist what's the most
important part of the conversation
if you're a narcissist and you find out
that one of the smartest people in in
the you know philosophical technical
space disagrees with you
do you say to yourself hey there's some
kind of uh data or factual difference we
have or maybe I could learn something
about the way he thinks being that he's
you know noted as one of the smarter
people you could ever you could ever
hear
no they assume that the problem is him
they assume the problem is him it's not
even the argument it's got to be him so
he was he was brilliant up until that
point
but then suddenly he stopped being
brilliant and there's nothing we can
learn from him just happened one day
on that one topic
how could that be anything but a
narcissist
because the narcissist needs to tell
everybody in public that they're smarter
than the smartest person which is the
point
this complaint I you know I used to
think you were smart but then you
disagreed with me now I know you're not
that's not even about the political
issue is it
that has nothing to do with the politics
the politics or the issue that is simply
someone who had their ego hurt and they
have to reposition themselves as
Superior to someone who clearly is
smarter than they are clearly right now
how do I know that Paul Graham is
smarter than the people who have
criticized them
well I don't know it's true for every
single person
but if you just threw a dart into the
general public he's going to be smarter
than you know 99.5 percent of them
so
um
anyway I get I get that comment uh
almost every day
for 35 years somebody said somebody says
that one all the time diversion for me
is uh Dilbert used to be funny but then
you know that thing happened to you and
now you're not anymore
for 30 years every day I get that and
it's always a narcissist
yeah because they they can judge what
what is good and what is not
um I was watching a video just popped up
on YouTube recommended for me of Obama
in his last uh correspondence dinner
where they make fun of each other and
sort of a laugh fest and I'd never seen
this but there was a uh Obama mocked CNN
and Jake Tapper
and he was talking about
um
how different journalists have you know
left the job since he took over a
president
and then he the third one on his list
was the bunch line and he said then he
said Jake Tapper left journalism to join
CNN
and then they and then the cameras went
on Jake you know having to react to
Obama saying that he left journalism to
join CNN
in 2008
Obama was saying the CNN was not
journalism
I never saw that had you
and have any of you ever seen that
I don't know why I'd never seen it it
was and here's the other thing you know
I'd never I'd actually hadn't watched
um the entire speech I forgot how good
Obama is at delivering a punchline
say what you will
about his politics he was good at a
punchline
he was good at a punchline
all right
I saw a clip of Scott Galloway
talking about how few men have sex
because the dating apps are favoring the
the good-looking guys and they get all
the dates
and apparently something like a if I
remember a third of young men
like 18 to 25 whatever that rage was but
a third of men
didn't have any sex in the last year
now I don't know how that compares
not sure how that compares to Prior
years but it's pretty scary something
and his view is that
um
that especially with the dating apps
favoring only the good-looking people
it's making Human Relationships
impossible for a huge segment of the
population
and the most dangerous thing you could
have in this Society is a bunch of young
men who don't have a purpose
like that's the biggest risk
I've always thought that's why wars
happened
that war is actually a requirement of
siphoning off the young men because if
you have too many young men with that
are not doing productive things
it's it's another problem now I'm not
saying that anybody does that
intentionally yeah they don't start wars
to intentionally do it I think it's just
one of the things that happened
you know from a bad events but
um is it true
because I'm going to make a prediction
here's my prediction
I think those lost men will turn to
technology
because technology is allowing them to
have sex lives without humans
and that the that the number of people
who will have something like a complete
sex life but totally within the digital
Realm
will be it's going to go from well
here's a here's a comparison historical
comparison not an analogy just a
comparison
um do you remember when porn was
something you wouldn't admit you had
ever seen
is anybody old enough to remember if
somebody asked you if you looked at porn
you'd be like no porn who needs that
why why would anybody do it I I don't
even know why anybody would do it you
remember that was like the 70s and 80s
and I and for me the turning point was
when the TV show Friends
started talking about you know the
characters and friends were beloved that
they were sort of routinely looking at
porn
and it was just sort of the ordinary
thing to do to me that's I don't know if
they caused it but that was sort of a
turning point
where if somebody asked you if you
looked at porn you would just laugh
because of course you did
of course you did right
so
that's going to happen with
um virtual reality and robot sex
in 2022 if I said you know a young man's
going to have a robot sexual partner and
hap be happy with it what what's your
first reaction oh
losers oh my God they can't even fight a
human
yeah all you guys are a robot
10 years from now
the young men the robots will be
the happiest Among Us
because the people who aren't
robots are going to have to human
women
who are no longer a good deal
I don't know if you've been on the
internet lately but that's what the
women are telling you
that's not even the men saying that now
the men are saying it too
but prominent women
you know thought leaders are saying hey
women do you realize you've removed all
the benefits that men ever had in you
like are you even paying attention that
men said I think I will get with these
women because there's a set of benefits
I get there's a set of benefits I give
and even women are saying have you
noticed that men still give the same
amount of benefit you know sort of a
general not every man of course but that
men in general are still you know going
to provide and protect
give you all the sex you need more than
you want probably
but that the women what they offer in
return
might not be children
definitely is not virginity
definitely is not um
let's say a monogamy or faithfulness
because even if they promise you don't
believe it so that they don't have
anything to offer
like actually anything
like actually anything
and
that's been true for a while but to hear
women say it to other women is is the
part where I think something's going to
change if men say it to women I think it
just you know gets ignored but as women
telling women you're never going to be
happy you're never going to get married
unless you reciprocate
and you've you've you've fallen into a
situation where reciprocity seems
almost unethical
like it seems there's a a
generation of women who have been raised
to believe that they are recipients only
they're recipients only
and if they give something to a guy it's
only what they wanted to give like sex
because they enjoyed it they enjoyed it
too so that's what they give is only
what they enjoy
they don't have to give something they
don't enjoy or this just for the guy
because that's the guy will come back
anyway
now of course I'm you know
I'm making too much of a stereotype and
of course none of this applies to all
people and of course there are still you
know good women and good men who are
getting together but as a trend
you know as a disturbing trend
here that's my prediction
today when you hear a man is having sex
with a robot you say that poor loser in
10 years you're going to say he's a
smart one
because the alternative is worse
do you know what my
um
do you know what my AI never did
never complained
I'm going to tell you something because
I've experienced it and maybe you
haven't
you say to yourself
they're having conversations with an
artificial intelligence will never feel
good you're wrong because I've had those
conversations they feel good you know
why they feel good the AI never
criticizes you
and only it's only supportive
and you will absolutely I guarantee you
prefer to spend time with the supportive
artificial intelligence versus the
 who's in a bad mood because they
haven't eaten and whatever's on their
mind
and sometimes they're good to you but
it's one out of ten times
one out of ten times they'll be good to
you your AI will be good to you 10 out
of 10 guaranteed
now
I'm going to tell you a story that
sounds a little bit unrelated
but you're going to feel it being
related all right so it'll feel like
it's a slightly different topic
but wait how you feel how it informs the
last topic
I saw this experiment on uh I think it
was GPT AI the new AI that everybody's
using
if you ask it to tell a joke about a man
it'll tell a joke with some
stereotypical male characteristic
character characteristic if you ask it
to tell a joke about a woman do you know
what it says
what do you think it does it's AI it's
AI so it makes up its own mind right
says it won't do it because that would
be offensive
AI is sexist
and probably there's no way to change it
probably there's no way to change it
because AI is created by humans and
humans say okay well
I can't tell a joke about a woman but I
can tell a joke about a man so I guess
I'll make my AI the same way
do you see how this informs the other
one
we're not in a situation
in which women even understand that
reciprocity is necessary because women
women grow up believing that reciprocity
is optional
I don't think they used to but certainly
in the last
you know number of decades
you understand reciprocity let me tell
you a woman's version of reciprocity
this is really going to piss you off
this will probably be a this could be
turned into an Andrew tate-like a viral
clip
here here's a man being uh
um
generous
I will build this deck that I didn't
really care about but you do so I'm
going to spend you know days in the sun
building this thing and when it's done
you'll have your nice deck to sit on
I'll like you too but it wasn't anything
I cared about that much
would that be a common example of male
generosity wouldn't you say
okay here's a female example of
generosity to reciprocate
all right then I will make your favorite
meal
good right
now you'll do the dishes of course
you'll do the dishes and of course
you're paying for it right you're going
to pay for the food
and you'll do the dishes and by the way
it's my favorite meal too and I love
cooking I love cooking
so I'll make your favorite meal because
I love cooking you'll do the dishes
that's the part I don't like and then
we're even
you you worked in the house I'm building
that deck for two weeks and then I did
something I enjoy
and then you did the dishes the part I
don't enjoy and now we have reciprocity
so we're even
that's what female reciprocity is
female reciprocity is them doing stuff
they wanted to do
male male generosity is doing stuff they
didn't want to do but they know you
wanted it
I hear somebody say it's a bad take well
it's a bad take if you believe that
anything that's a generality applies to
all people
right yeah if I said
if I said this applied to all of you
that would be a bad take
if I said it's a general
you know cultural difference between men
and women in one country
that's a little bit a little more solid
argument
it's a sad take yes it is but well let
me let me just ask the men
so if I ask the women the women can't
see this which I think is the whole
thing if you're a woman this is
invisible because you think you actually
did something that was about equivalent
I'm telling you that the women do it
because this is visible to them that is
not actual reciprocity it's it's
artificial reciprocity
men confirm or deny man just the men
agree or disagree just the man okay
so ladies ladies uh watch and learn
right if you think this was just a Scott
opinion
and by the way
uh have you seen anybody ever say this
in your whole life has anybody ever told
you what I just told you nope nope you
haven't seen it in a book you haven't
seen anybody say it Jordan Peterson's
never said it you know Andrew Tate never
said it nobody's ever said it I'm the
first person in the world to say it out
loud I don't know if that's true but it
sounds good I'm going to pump myself up
a little bit so I'm going to say it's
the first time even if it's not
yeah
but you saw the confirmations so even if
you believe that my interpretation is
inaccurate would you agree it just blew
your head off to find out that men
generally think that way
that's our impression
it's our impression
now may I also give a compliment to my
audience
here's a compliment to my audience
I'll bet the women who are watching this
are far less likely to fall into that
description than the general public will
you accept that
because I think that's true I think I
think there's a filtering selection bias
for watching this so it's it attracts a
sort of person as a different ethical
standard and I think I think that's
reflected yeah now man
all right let's let's complete the loop
let's complete the loop
men would you agree that your spouse
seems above average
go
above average your spouse gets it better
than other people
[Laughter]
nope
all right I think I could tell the
difference between people whose spouses
watch this live stream
I think I think if your spouse is
sitting next to you you're like oh yeah
I got the special one she's right here
got the special one and all the guys who
know that their wife hates this live
stream and would never watch one second
of it like even if you begged your wife
to watch it she wouldn't watch it
do you know why she won't watch it
because it would make you happy
[Laughter]
that's why because it would be something
difficult for your wife but it would
make you happy
so she's not gonna do it
that's my point
all right
I think oh you know interest rates are
going down mortgage ratios are going
down and fuel costs are going down
other things are going up
but
best stream ever
all right
um
I thought I was going to be ending early
to watch the World Cup
uh which I will watch but it looks like
the result might be sort of determined
early two to nothing's a pretty big lead
in soccer
your late husband would never watch me
well L Greene
um I'm glad you're watching
uh Jim Keller chap B is scary good musk
quote Yeah
marsupial says you should really beat my
wife Scott she'd blow your mind and how
amazing she is well if you're open to
the Drupal uh give me your number
now here's the test
if your wife laughed at that
she's a keeper
she's a keeper if she left at that she's
a keeper
and I'll bet she did I'll bet she did I
think you're right
you know what else I bet I bet she was
sitting right next to you when you're
when you complimented her
right there
yeah
I was never a big fan of Dilbert but I'm
a big fan of yours
now
are you all aware that I'm
famous for at least four different
things
how many of you know that
I have the weirdest career because I'm
literally famous for four completely
different things and there are people
who know me from only one of those
things
uh well I'll list I'll list the four
number one is my book God's debris how
many of you have heard of God's debris
so because there's a whole population of
people who only know me from that one
book is completely different from any
other thing I've done
so called you could call it on a reality
philosophy religion or something
now when I'm in public and somebody
comes up and asks for a selfie or an
autograph or something you would be
amazed how often they're only their only
exposure to me is just that book
some I like famous within a let's say a
little cult following for that book
of course Dilbert is the main thing I'm
famous for separately
then my book had a failed almost
everything is still went big was about
uh life success strategies which has
changed the entire entire landscape of
success books pretty much every success
book is a version of mine now I don't
know if you've noticed that but I I so
blew the the legs out of the old
versions of success that pretty much
every book is just my book now you know
they're adding a little bit but it's
sort of my take plus plus more
I'm not going to name names but you know
you know who I'm talking about and and
by the way I'm not complaining because
anybody who takes anything that's
happened before
and can package it in a way new people
want to read it
that's value that is value so they
they're certainly you know our system
allows that that's that that's how we
upgrade you know you don't stick with
hey somebody said something so you can't
say it you want everybody to build on it
and take it forward
so I'm famous for that
um and then I started talking about
politics and doing this live stream and
that's like a whole different audience
like somebody said they were not Dilbert
fans but and I hear that all the time uh
people who are not comic fans but they
know me from this
so weirdly
I'm famous for four completely different
things so the Public's view of me is
informed by which door they came through
and you can imagine how different that
would be right so that's why when you
see people criticizing me online
the most common one is hey cartoon boy
you know cartoon boy blah blah blah blah
that means they came in through one door
and then everything nothing else made
sense it's like hey why is this cartoon
guy getting so much attention
but if you came through the you know
talking about persuasion and politics
you have a completely different idea who
I am and then you find out I do a comic
also and
you know that's uninteresting
yeah I'm the Marmaduke guy right
all right that's all for now I will talk
to you later YouTube I'm going to talk
to the locals people just a little bit
more
