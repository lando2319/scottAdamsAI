good morning everybody
welcome to the best thing that ever
happened to you possibly the best thing
that ever happened to anybody it's
called coffee with scott adams and today
mostly good news
it's a weird day now it could be that
i'm just in the mood to hear some good
news so i'm filtering it differently but
i'm going to put you in a good mood too
so that you can filter it the way i do
every everything's looking good
it really is and all you need to
come to this higher level of happiness
and awareness is a copper mug glass of
tiger tails or steiner candy jug of
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes everything better and
it's working
it's called the simultaneous shipping
habits now go
ah yes coffee
i saw a tweet just before i got on that
uh
rapper actor ice cube
says that they offered chris tucker 10
to 12
million dollars to be in their next
movie
friday something
a sequel
and chris tucker turned down 10 to 12
million dollars because of religious
reasons
and he apparently objected to being in
another movie
in which he was smoking weed and cussing
so chris tucker is out of the roll
10 to 12 million dollars because he
didn't want to be involved with weed and
cussing
so i tweeted back to icecube and asked
if auditions are still open because
if ever there was a role
made for me
i don't want to say born for the role
that's going too far
but
lock
key
perfect fit perfect fit now there was a
day where a person who looked like me
would not be cast in an all-black movie
but we don't live in backwards times
anymore
in the dark ages
no pun intended
they they would have been able to just
cast their movie and completely ignore
other people saying hey let me in that
movie but not now
in our woke environment
i believe i can pull off that role
and a lot of it is acting
you know
sometimes if you don't have the perfect
look for a role
the audience won't matter if your acting
is so good
so i think uh i think i could get my
acting up to a level where i could take
over this chris tucker roll
smoke some weed
cuss on camera
i might even practice a little that
today
you don't know
because i don't like to go into an
audition unless i've got a lot of
practice
well did you see the picture of romney's
family i guess they took a holiday
family picture
and i gotta say
this jaw dropping
you know i've never seen a family
picture they have that much impact on me
because it's the last thing that
interests most of us
okay that's your family i don't even
know your family
but you should see the size
of mitt romney's family i think they're
all
you know kids and grandkids and stuff it
looks like it
now they are shockingly white
no big surprise right it's the biggest
group of white people i've ever seen in
one place because in america you
couldn't assemble that many white people
to take a picture i mean
we just don't live in a country where
that many white people are in the same
place but in utah
and in the more in the romney family now
i'm not criticizing the romneys um in
fact i would like to give them a holiday
compliment
which is
do you ever wonder what it is like
or what does it mean
to win at life
like what would that look like to be a
winner at life
because we think of romney as you know a
loser in the sense that you lost the
presidency but you know he was very
successful in his career and
and all that but when you see a picture
of how he has spread his genes
that looks like the winningest thing
i've ever seen
it's just it's amazing he's got like a
genghis khan
light kind of mode there where uh
this mofo is spreading his genes like uh
like nobody's business
so i would think that from an
evolutionary standpoint the more you
spread your genes the more winning you
are
uh so i i've never seen anybody win that
hard before
he created a lot of
a lot of clones
anyway
uh in more tragic news john madden died
most of you heard the name john madden
famous football coach
but also famous
for living
in my town
so the entire time that john madden has
lived where i live and by the way this
is the second time i've lived in this
town
i used to live in another town that he
lived in
and then he moved
and then i moved when i got married and
you know moved to the town where my wife
lives with the kids
and
and i ended up in this town twice
now the weird thing about this is it
made me the second most famous person in
town
twice
in both cases it was because of him
now there's nothing wrong with being the
second most famous person in your town
but i got to tell you being the most
famous person in your town is a little
bit better
now of course that i don't want to
detract from the fact that it's a
tragedy that john madden died but he did
make it to 85
and from what i know from him
just from his public persona
if you make it to 85 and you're going
strong and you you go out on top
i don't know i don't even think john
madden would be sad about john madden
dying
he did it so well
so he lived his life well went out in
style timing was good
uh but like so many stories in the news
they have a weird connection to me
like personally like this will have an
effect on me personally
it's weird
all right um
there was a article in uh medscape
uh suggesting that maybe the moderate
alcohol benefits
the health benefits of moderate alcohol
look increasingly doubtful
that's right
so some in the medical scientific
community
now believe that the common thing we
used to believe that moderate drinking
might actually be good for your health
as if
uh yes as if drinking just drinking just
a little bit of poison will be good for
you
um
but it looks like science is starting to
bend the other way
it's increasingly doubtful that it's
good for you
and
how many of you remember me making the
prediction
that someday we would learn that the
most common thing that we hear all the
time
moderate drinking is good for you then
it was never true
that's one of my predictions for years
that eventually we would learn that was
never true
i'm not going to claim victory yet
but so i'll keep the i'll keep my
prediction alive and just say it's uh un
unresolved at this point but i it's
going this way
the in the end
someday
we are not going to say that moderate
drinking was good for you there's i just
there's nothing in my life experience
that suggests that could even happen
i mean anything could happen i suppose
but
everything pushes the other direction
about this if you're predicting it goes
the other way
i'd like to take that bet
um
2022 is looking interesting but also
will be a way to test our world theories
which is very interesting to me remember
i tell you that your worldview
is probably subjective just like
everybody else's
but the only thing you can tell about it
that is useful is whether it predicts
so if your view of the world predicts
accurately well or better than other
people's well
you have a pretty good world view even
if it's not
true in some
some sense
so we're going to get a test here it's
coming up and here's what the test looks
like
in 2022 when we do the
the elections for the
for congress
we know now that 23 democrats are
retiring or were bidding from another
office so basically 23 democrats will be
leaving the field
when the republicans are only
five down
so republicans only need to win five
more seats to take control
and there are already 23 democrats who
are leaving the job
now on top of that you've got the
polling that would suggest that the
republicans are going to sweep you've
got biden not fixing the problems he
promised to fix
you've got a lot going on that would all
can you let's see if you agree with the
starting assumption
is the starting assumption
that literally every expert
is saying oh the republicans are just
going to sweep
but
give me a fact jack
is it true that every expert
says the republicans are going to sweep
right
everyone even the democrats say it
now except for the politicians but the
people who are you know because they
have to say it but but the people on
experts on both sides just say yeah
republicans are going to sweep so here's
how you get to test
your world view
if your world view is that there is some
shadowy group of democrats
that can change the elections to
anything they want
the democrats will hold congress
if you're right
would you agree
that if the elections are in fact
corrupt in ways that we can't easily
audit
and if they robbed trump right in front
of the public
meaning that everyone who looked at it
said
you know it really kind of looked like
trump was going to win this and then
surprisingly he didn't
and then what happened
well there was a a little event at the
capitol which there is a strong argument
that suggests
that it was not an organic event at
least the
the most dangerous parts about it when
they breached the actual
uh
you know trespassing territory and got
violent and
it would seem as if the country has been
set up
to make it unlikely that there would be
an insurrection because the
insurrectionist quote insurrectionists
who weren't really insurrectionist
have been punished so severely or it
looks like they will be
many of them still in jail
and so we have a situation where if the
worst case scenario is correct
and the elections are rigged i'm not
saying this is true by the way i'm
saying we'll get to test that world view
versus the world view that everything
was fine
but if the world view that things are
rigged is true
we do have a situation where they could
steal
the election
right in front of you
in a way that everybody would sort of
think maybe it happened because
because it didn't go the way everybody
thought
and nothing would happen
because there wouldn't be a second
insurrection
they've already
pre-stopped a revolution in the future
by making it seem like one already
happened
and then stopping the one that was fake
to make it like really clear you don't
want to try marching on the capitol
so
there are you know obviously this would
not be a hundred percent uh proof
but i'll make um
i'm not even sure which way i would
predict
ah
you know i think i have to do a split
prediction for this one which was very
unsatisfying i'd like to do something
like this
republicans will sweep in 2022
right nice clean
consistent prediction
but we can only depend on the votes
we can't really depend on the vote count
now let me say
let me say my view of the election
integrity
i am aware of no
evidence of massive fraud in 2020.
i want to say that as clearly as
possible i'm personally
just personally
not aware
of anything that would look like massive
fraud that has been determined
it is also true that we can't fully
audit our system
so if in fact massive fraud happened
it's unclear that we could know that
number three
if you have a system that can't be
audited
there will always be massive fraud
you just don't know if it's happened yet
it could be next time could be the time
after but there's no way it doesn't
happen
it would be like dropping a ball
and expecting that sometimes it doesn't
the gravity won't work
now the gravity will work every time
if you create a system that's
not
transparent and the advantage of being
able to control that non-transparent
system is essentially controlling the
planet
the greatest payoff you could ever have
i think if i change this software
i'm in charge of the planet
biggest stakes you could ever have
in a non-transparent system
a hundred percent of the time you get
massive fraud
not sometimes
it's not one of like oh we're surprised
there's some massive fraud no it's just
like gravity
if you make it that easy for massive
fraud you'll get it every time you just
have to wait
that's all it is
just a matter of time
so
i certainly would not be one who's who
can say to you because we don't have an
auditable election system i can't say to
you that this won't be a rigged election
in 2022.
i can't say that with any confidence
i it's like a coin flip 50 50 maybe
and only 50 50 because i don't have
information
if i had information maybe i'd change
that a lot
um
yeah the coveted elections are always
going to add some sketchiness to the
outcome that's true
but if your world view is that the some
shadowy figures aligned with democrats
can steal everything and get away with
it
let's see if they do the midterms
if they don't steal the midterms
you're going to have to rethink
if they stole uh
the trump versus biden election
unless
we found this uh there was some loophole
there that got closed in the meantime
i don't know what that would be
all right i know i know a lot of uh
republican managed states are trying to
tighten things up so we'll see
here's an interesting little uh positive
thing
came out of sandia national laboratories
one of the sandia labs is
bicycle distance for me just down the
road because everything is about me
and
one of the things that california gets
right
i'm going to defend my state slightly
california gets a lot of grief
and i give it i give it a lot of grief
too
but there is one thing that california
does right is it puts a lot of smart
people in the same place and a lot of
good things happen
when you put your smartest people in the
same place and say ah this little piece
of territory we're going to put all the
smartest people you just you know start
companies and do whatever you're doing
well here's what some smart people at
sandia national labs do i don't know if
this came out of the local wand or
there's there's an albuquerque version
of this
but they found out how to turn coal ash
into rare earth metals
what
so the you know one of the biggest waste
problems from coal is the coal ash
but apparently now they can take that
coal ash and change it into rare earth
minerals but you say to yourself well
that sounds expensive
except here's there's here's how you do
it
they use a harmless food-grade solvent
in other words some of you basically buy
off the shelf
uh i think right
uh and that's it
you just you just mix it with some
chemicals that are sort of available
you know everywhere
and it turns into rare earth materials
if you wait a day
and i don't know what kind of earth
materials you get out of this but this
seems like a pretty big deal that we
weren't expecting now the pushback on
this is that apparently there is already
some technique
for recovering rare earth minerals from
coal ash
and some think that the existing
technique gets a higher percentage of it
and might be more economical but it's
hard for me to imagine that anything
would be more economical than pouring
some over-the-counter juice on it and
waiting a day
you know even if you get a lower
percentage of uh
you know gain from that
i feel as if
it's so easy that it's still going to be
economical relative to the alternatives
so i don't know if every uh pile of coal
ash is going through the existing
process but i doubt it or else this
would be a story
so there must be some economical
advantages to this
however we should always be aware that
every story of good news is fake
when it comes to science
right now that's i'm exaggerating a
little bit
a little bit
but wouldn't you say based on your life
experience
and 99 of what you hear about great news
coming out of science and that's not
true
about 99 of the time
so i'm not going to say this is an
exception but it's fun to read about
uh michael mina who is famous for being
at least on twitter and elsewhere and
with the government
the most
notable and
loudest most effective voice on rapid
testing
he
apparently has been so successful or
events have changed people's minds as
well
he tweeted this he says you know things
have come full circle
when people are starting to tell me
remember he's the he's the king of
of promoting rapid testing he said when
people are starting to tell me
that
pcr tests take a long time to turn
negative and we should be using rapid
antigen tests
to test and of isolation
so in other words
if what you're trying to do is get out
of isolation what matters most is if
you're still infected
and the and the rapid tests that are
less sensitive
do a better job
now i think i'm saying this right but
let me explain that
if the rapid test is very effective at
finding out if you have a lot of viral
load
and it can do it quickly and cheaply
then you can get out of quarantine a
little faster not with perfect certainty
but really really good
whereas if you wait for the pcr test
which might you know might be longer to
get an appointment then you got to wait
a day you know to get a result
uh you probably have to leave home to do
it right
so that the the right answer always was
the rapid test
that was always the right answer for
getting out of quarantine not
necessarily the right answer for maybe
testing ahead of a trip perhaps i don't
know maybe there might be some
differences there but for getting on a
quarantine
where less than 100 percent
effectiveness is you know pretty much
guaranteed
i think michael mina's claims have been
validated at this point
history has moved in his direction just
as you would like i'm sure
all right
um
here's your test of the press
in the jerusalem post
this week there's a story that iran is
very close just months away
from a breakdown ability to create a
nuclear weapon
all right so that's today
iran is two months away from a nuclear
weapon that's a 2021
reuters reported the same thing in 2012.
la times reported the same thing in 2003
and the new york times reported the same
thing in
1995.
and here's the fun part
the public is so now so well trained
that when i saw the tweet about um you
know there was a story
that iran was close to a nuclear weapon
you should see the comments
the comments are just vicious
yep just like every year since i was
born
and
the problem is
that
with technology it's like the flying car
yes it's true we don't have a flying car
but i'm not going to bet against the
flying car 100 years from now are you
i mean some things are guaranteed to
happen you just have to wait a little
bit longer so i would say it's largely
guaranteed that iran will get nuclear
bomb capabilities
because it'll be just easier in the
future and you know they have lots of
time and capability
and it's a high priority
so it seems like if you wait long enough
one of these stories will be true so
you've got the little boy crying wolf
problem that the press has been crying
wolf since 1995
and the public is just sort of tired of
it it just doesn't feel real anymore
even though it probably is it probably
is real
israel
israel
that's interesting
this is the first time i've ever thought
that the country of israel
is spelled israel
how did i not notice that before
i am i like the last person on earth to
make that connection
that's weird
huh
simulation is winking at us
all right um
now those of you who think that this is
all israel influencing the u.s press to
get what they want
uh well this this story came from the
jerusalem post so
i mean this is israel influencing itself
but of course these articles do get
picked up
now can
can israel influence the press in the
united states what do you think
can israel the country
influence stories that appear in the
united states
oh you anti-semitic
bastards
are so anti-semitic
would you say that about some other
group if they weren't jewish
would you say that they could control
the media
yeah you would because they can
almost everybody can control the media
it's actually pretty easy
so does does israel control the media or
at least
plant stories that are beneficial to
israel do they do that in america press
i don't know but everybody else does
don't you assume they do why wouldn't
they
literally everybody does
how hard is it to get a journalist in a
major publication to write your story
really easily
as we've seen russia collusion hoax
really easy to get people to write that
you can get people to write things that
are obviously hoaxes find people hoax
drinking bleach oaks there's no shortage
of journalists who will write anything
you want
in major publications
so it used to be that i think that if
you said oh there's you know a jewish
conspiracy theory to control the news
you'd sound like a crazy person
but now it's just every group can do
that
israel just happens to be on the list of
groups
the only thing about israel is that it's
a group
because every group can do it it's easy
uh rasmus and nezapol
asked this question which might sound
familiar to you i wasn't i didn't have
anything to do with this but
uh esta is russia more like an ally or
an enemy of the u.s
how do you think it came out
well just guess before i tell you the
answer what percentage of people in of
likely voters that's who they usually
pull
of u.s likely voters what percentage of
them would say that
russia is an ally
what percent
uh i'm saying uh 25 25
okay you're being funny
uh 40 50.
yeah the the real answer according to
the poll
is that
43 percent
said that we're somewhere in between an
ally an enemy and five percent said
outright ally
so if you had the ones who said we're
sort of allies the 43 percent
to the ones who say we are allies you
get up to 48
say yeah we're sort of
ally-ish and then you got another eight
percent that aren't sure
but i feel like you'd be sure if they
were an enemy
so i feel like i'd throw them in with
the
you know must be somewhere in between
so
i've been telling you forever that the
the arc of history is bending
undeniably
toward the u.s and russia being allies
in the future
maybe not this year maybe in 10 years
but it's going to happen it's because of
space
we have to be allies in space because
there's just no way we want to be
fighting russia in space
we've got china to deal with and so does
russia
you know we're going to want to have at
least the u.s and russia on the same
side
because i doubt we'll be on the same
side with china
so
um the public is not terribly
um disagreeable with that idea 45
percent do say that russia is an enemy
but that's less than half
so less than half of the country
considers russia an enemy
now if you changed it to something like
a
competitor or something
then i think you get more people agree
if you use the word enemy it's i don't
know
i i'm not sure that's justified but
what's happening it looks like just
countries pursuing their own interests
it's like they're a competitor
uh it doesn't feel like it's personal
does it
you know there are things that feel
personal
like terrorism um
you know
osama bin laden that felt personal
but whatever problems we have with
russia they don't really feel personal
just feels like government versus
government
so there's a story about monoclonal
antibodies being
florida having less access to them and
they're blaming the federal government
for that apparently there's a big
shortage of these
monoclonal antibodies
but it seems to be a real shortage
it's not clear if florida is being
punished by the federal government
for being republican lead versus
democrat-led
i don't know about that
but it's kind of important because at
the same time that the federal
government said they're going to
restrict these antibodies
the cdc revised their omicron estimate
down from 73 percent of the new cases to
59.
so remember when i was telling you
omicron was you know almost
three-quarters of our cases in the
united states
it turns out that cdc says no
when they check it again or some
different way
it's a 59 percent of cases now wait hold
on
wait it's uh omicron is 59 wait
that's reduced from 73. hold on hold on
okay it's up to 73 again
because you see the omicron spreads fast
am i wrong that in the time it takes
them to do this study and
tell us about it there's no way that
that 59 hasn't already gone to 73
am i right
because it doesn't take long to go to 50
from 59 to 73
it it takes about the time it takes them
to do a study
so they should have said we studied it
at 59 so it probably is 73 by now
or something like that
all right
interesting story in the wall street
journal
now the fact that this is in the wall
street journal
on top of the fact that we saw jennifer
rubin
seeming to do a turn on the uh the
lockdowns or the mandates
so so even jennifer rubin who is um
famously associated with the democrats
but even more famously associated with
being
sort of the the person that the
people in power go to
to be their messenger
now
you know so i don't get sued i'll say i
don't know if any of that's true
allegedly
but
people would look to
to see her change of opinion as being
not her opinion per se but an approved
opinion
so she is signaling whether or not this
is true this is just speculation
but the change in her let's say
mode of attack when talking about the
pandemic has conspicuously changed
to you know closer to the lettuce free
model
which suggests that the
um the powers behind the power whoever
they may be
are also in that frame of mind
meaning that both sides seem to be
moving toward the same place
but the right is already there and the
left has to have a reason to be there in
other words they want to be there too
but they need a because
uh could be a fake because but you need
some reason to give why you changed
so the jennifer rubin's signal seems to
be a signal that the left wants to get
there
and is trying to get there
but at the same time in the wall street
journal an article that i found
surprising
and it's surprising because we we had
the hydroxychloroquine experience and we
had the ivermectin experience meaning
things that many smart people thought
totally definitely work
but the powers that bees had
totally definitely unproven don't use
them
now we've got a new one
fluvoxabine existing medication
used for things such as
ocd
which is interesting because as a it
modulates inflammation i think that's
the same as reducing inflammation but
maybe modulate has a little more nuance
to it
and so this drug which works for ocd
modulates inflammation
which makes me wonder is ocd
actually inflammation of the brain
is that what causes it
and then i google that and sure enough
there are smart people who think that
inflammation in the brain is what causes
ocd
and then i thought to myself
is inflammation everything like is
everything inflammation if we could find
a way to manage our inflammation or even
find out what's causing us to be
somewhat so much more easily inflamed i
think it's chemicals and pollution in
the environment or our diet
i feel like there's something
environmental
that humans have created for themselves
that is making us be inflamed all the
time because you feel people are being
just consistently
having problem with inflammation it
doesn't matter what your problem is you
also have inflammation now i get that
inflammation is a sign of a problem
so that i might just be thinking
backwards oh if you have a problem
that causes inflammation or associated
with it it's not that the inflammation
causes the condition
or does it
or does it because it's easy to imagine
that ocd is a
is a brain that's not functioning as
smoothly as they should
and inflammation one would imagine would
be a reason that would cause that
so he says jack chellum called it
decades ago
somebody says sugar is everything
that could be
could sugar be the thing that's causing
us to experience more inflammation
yeah anyway these are just speculations
and questions
but this uh drug that exists doctors
could recommend this
label because
initial trials with it
that are not randomized control trials
so they don't have the gold standard
test for this surprise
but the the ones that they do have which
are lower quality kind of evidence are
are really strong
really strong
but
so was ivormectin
so was hydroxychloroquine
but
apparently the wall street journal and
they they they call that out as a
problem so listen to this
so although it's generally legal to do
off-label prescriptions so doctors could
legally
uh prescribe it for anything they wanted
as long as it made sense you know as
long as their medical judgment
they had a reason for it
totally legal even even if it's not
approved for that use
but
what happened to the doctors who
prescribed ivermectin
was that good for their careers
forget about whether ivermectin worked
or didn't work separate question
was it good for the careers of the
doctors to recommend it and then get
demonized
not so much not so much
and here we have a problem where the
national what is it the nih
it doesn't doesn't recommend it
so you've put doctors in a position
where they would be giving something
that is specifically
not forbidden but unrecommended
i don't know if there's a better way to
say that
it would be one thing to use something
for off-label use
if everyone else in the world had been
silent about it
that's just you and your doctor making a
good you know judgment
you hope
but if the national institute of health
is saying don't do this
because it's unproven
then the doctor is a little bit more
uh
than the doctors
yeah i know you've been telling me about
fluvoxamine
but the there's a lot there's a lot of
these
drugs that i guess i could have talked
about more
but the fact that the wall street
journal is certainly presenting this as
a solution
and uh here's the here's the payoff
it would cost you uh
like four dollars for your entire 10-day
course of fluvoxamine
four dollars
so there is now a basically a four
dollar pill
you know you get a number of them but
four dollars
that smashes uh covet if you take it
early
compare that to the new pills that are
being approved that will be thousands of
dollars
compared to monoclonal antibodies which
poor apparently monoclonal antibodies
are becoming less useful
because the the new variants aren't
responding as well so i think omicron
doesn't care so much about your
monoclonal antibodies so that's one of
the reasons the government was using for
reducing their use
which may have been a lie you know
so
do you think that fluvoxamine could ever
break through
assuming it works
in the face of the pharma companies uh
would lose
let's say fluvoxamine works the way
these unreliable tests say it would
the big pharma would lose
give me a number how much money would
big pharma lose in vaccinations and
covert pills if this existing little i
imagine it's i don't know is it generic
by now fluvoxamine it's so cheap it
looks like it must be generic but i
could be wrong about that
um
3 trillion
i don't think it's billions i think
we're into trillions are we
i think we're talking about
the pharma com companies having three
trillion dollars of potent you know over
years of potential loss
do you think the pharma companies would
allow a four dollar
drug to wipe them out of their trillions
of dollars and what would they do to
stop that from happening
how much would they spend to protect
a revenue stream of three trillion
dollars or something like that
billions
billions
you just open the wallet and it would
just stream out
um
so i don't know if you can uh you can
trust any of this apparently there was a
study
of a whole bunch of people who got it at
uh one of the local race tracks here
near me because everything's about me
and uh the people who took the
fluvoxamine had zero problems in terms
of death and major hospitalization and
the control group
although it's not a randomized control
group the control group had a number of
problems
so every time it's tested they get the
same result which is the fluvoxabine is
nearly 100 effective
and the control group has trouble
but again
i'm sorry shecky reminds me it's not
about me it's about shecky i think
you're right
scott said last week that big pharma is
not trying to stop ivermectin nope never
said that dr johnson
will hide you again
he comes back every day
i don't know if it's a new account or
what
never said that
um
here's my thing that's bothering me
lately at the beginning of the pandemic
a lot of people made predictions and
said hey let's just ignore this pandemic
and it'll go away and it's just a cold
and other people said it's the worst
thing in the world and
uh millions are dying they can't both be
right
but we're at this point now where we're
we're saying that our experts were lying
to us about vaccines
who was lying
yeah i want to see your opinions because
i know a lot of you have this opinion
who exactly was lying about vaccines
pharma fouchy i'm saying saucy trump
and
media medal
do you think
do you think that the data that came out
of
the big vaccine trials
showed that the
vaccine wears off
do we have a smoking gun because i
haven't seen it yet
so i'm going to push the innocent until
proven guilty standard because i i think
somebody needs to
for the pharma companies as well now i'm
not i'm not pro pharma
in the sense that uh it's unambiguously
clear that the industry is uh criminal
lots of the time
i think we'd all agree with that but it
doesn't mean it's all criminal all the
time
right there's got to be like
real scientists doing real work
somewhere there
i think
i don't think it's a complete criminal
organization making
mock treatments that they're trying to
convince you worked
some of the time but not most of the
time
and so my question is this
where's the smoking gun
where's the data that says they knew
that these would wear off or that their
effectiveness would wane
because i feel like it probably exists
no you do you remember at the beginning
of the pandemic the experts who worked
in this field
said we've been trying to get a vaccine
for coronavirus for decades
and we're not even close
because there's something about it that
we haven't figured out how to do it
and then suddenly we had vaccines
after decades of the experts working
there saying yeah we don't we're not
even close
so
we're the experts who said we don't know
how to make a vaccine and we're not even
close
did they know
that if you tried
the effectiveness would wear off
or did they not even know how to make
the vaccines that we ended up making in
less than a year
were those experts aware
of the let's say mrna technique and
whatever j j used
were they aware of those techniques and
did they know from their own experiences
that if somebody made a vaccine
its efficacy would trail off too quickly
show me that document
or show me any investigative journalist
who's looking for it
here's where i'd
start find the people who said in the
beginning it should be just a google
search because i i saw it publicly just
do a google search
find the experts who said in the
beginning there's no way to do it it
can't be done this this quickly
find those experts and ask them this one
question
were you aware from all of your
experience
that you could make something that would
make a difference like our current
vaccines do but that it wouldn't
necessarily stop transmission
and that it wouldn't necessarily have
the efficacy that makes it a good
vaccine
were the experts aware of that at the
very beginning
then you'd have to find one at
say
pfizer or
what is it
the other company that you'd have to
find some document that says yeah we
can't do this but we're going to put out
a vaccine anyway because the vaccine
will do something
it just won't do what
people expect it to do
do you think do you think such a data
trail exists
because here's the problem and dr drew
is reminding me of this in a different
context the other day
that
people are true believers of things that
aren't true
and you can easily become a true
believer because all of the incentive is
for you to believe something imagine you
work for a big pharma company
and uh the expert said you can't make
this vaccine but you try anyway it's
sort of a patriotic as well as
commercial thing that makes sense you
try anyway
how easy would it be to convince
yourself that you had succeeded
when you hadn't
in other words even if you were looking
at your own data
would you be lying necessarily or would
you actually see it as working
even if the data didn't quite
say that as clearly as you are saying
you know there's this weird gray area
where people actually talk themselves
into the lie
and then you have to ask yourself oh
wait is it a lie if they believe it
because if they believe it it's just
being wrong
or you know being brainwashed themselves
so
it's a weird gray area and i i think
it's unproductive to imagine that all of
it is an intentional lie
because i suspect
the people who knew it wouldn't work
that knowledge may have died
between the people who had been trying
for years and the people who actually
developed these vaccines that there may
have been a like a communication gap or
far more likely because i imagine the
industry talks to each other a lot
far more likely there was a cognitive
thing that happens with the scientists
to think that they had
you know done the thing
you even see it on you see it on twitter
people will say i have the answer this
saves the world here it is it's vitamin
d
even i've done that
so the
the
the draw to be the savior you're the one
who came up with the thing that saved
the world is so strong it just bends
your brain
and maybe not everybody you have to have
a certain personality type
which i have
so i'm i'm especially susceptible
to illusions
of my own success
everybody i want you to hear that
clearly
that my personality type is extra
sensitive to this mistake
which is to think that i figured out the
solution to the world
because i want to believe that
my personality is so wired
toward i want to be useful and make a
difference and you know especially a big
difference
that if i thought i were close to it
my brain would say i got it
right
i know that i know that about myself
because i've like i've experienced it i
know my brain will push me from hey this
looks like a good thing to work into oh
yeah this is going to save the world i
think it happened to lots of people with
hydroxychloroquine
they wanted it to work but they also
wanted to be the one who said it works
right
it happened with ivermectin
people definitely wanted it to work
but they also wanted to be the one who
said it would work
and and i'm i'm more susceptible than
any of you
i think
to that
cognitive error
so if you're keeping me honest
that's where you should look especially
hard
because if if i'm deluded
this is an area i know in advance i
could easily be deluded in
so just
you know keep me honest that's that's
your job
keep me honest on that all right
um
so i'm not so sure people lied to us i
think there's something else deeper
going on
here are some basic things about the
pandemic that are going to be so
frustrating when it's over
that we have these two movies right
uh one one movie that uh there wasn't
much of anything that happened and if
we'd ignored it we would have been fine
and then the other movie is that we
we saved millions of lives
they can't both be true
we either saved millions of lives or we
didn't
and here's a question that also is in
this category
did flattening the curve work
now let me give you some context before
you answer just hold the question but
don't answer it yet right because i know
you have an answer but wait till i give
you new information
because the new information might modify
what you think okay
as ian bremmer is tweeting yesterday
we have nearly 450 000 known cova cases
in the u.s it's a new record by a long
margin
so the number of new cova cases just
new record
that is in the context of having no
availability of tests
so we reached a record number of
infections
but the real record is i don't know
some multiple that because how many
people have it and they couldn't test so
it's not confirmed
or how many people tested at home
do have it but didn't report it to
anybody now i guess they can do this
from some kind of statistical
uh way but i can't imagine that we're
capturing all the infected people it
doesn't seem possible to me
but
as ian bremer points out if omicron had
hit a year ago because a lot of this
spike is omicron it would be apocalyptic
how many of you would agree
that if we had this rate of infection
like through the roof infections but it
had been at the beginning of the
pandemic with the the worser
variant
the things would have been much worse
that seems fair right
now here's the question
did we delay long enough
to get us to omicron
while keeping the number of deaths lower
than it would have been
because if we did i would say flattening
the curve not in two weeks of course
but that the idea of flattening the
curve actually worked
but i don't know if you can really
conclude that can you because you don't
know what the other situation would look
like exactly there's no control
but
my feeling is
the flattening the curve worked
because it bought us time to get to the
better understanding of therapeutics
i'll call the vaccines therapeutic so
you don't argue with me
and it got us to the point where we had
another variant
but the counter argument would be the
variant would have come sooner
if we just let it spread through the
population so if we'd taken our million
deaths early
you know maybe we'd be done
instead of spreading out our million
deaths
but
if what we did was spread out the deaths
that were going to happen anyway
and kept our hospitals somewhat
functioning
i feel like flattening the curve sort of
worked
how many of you would uh push back
against that now i'm not talking about
the two weeks to flatten the curve i'm
talking about the idea
of flattening it until you you had new
tools
didn't didn't we succeed flattening it
until we had better tools
it looks like that but i don't think i
don't think you could conclude it yeah
the people say no i respect that opinion
because i don't think there's any way to
prove it this is sort of like you have
to take your life experience and put
that filter on it and say well
i know i feel like it worked
now you have to to be fair you have to
throw in all of the deaths that happen
because of the restrictions
and all the mental health problems and
that's not nothing that's a lot
so if you're doing a real cost benefit
analysis i don't know if you could ever
un untangle this
but i'll let me go this far
i would say you can't tell if the
flattening the curve thing worked
entirely
it looks like it did to me
but i'm open to the possibility that
just looking at doesn't really tell
you a lot yeah that's why you have
randomized control trials you can easily
be fooled
but i do think that it's ambiguous
enough
that i would give the leaders at least a
little bit of credit
for having tried
because we don't know if it worked
but
it looks like it was a good try
you know even though it was
deeply expensive
that's that's what leadership is doing
stuff that you wouldn't have done on
your own
and talking you into it
so um i point out i like to point out
that
uh leaders talk uncertainty whereas
experts can have the comfort of talking
in probability so your scientists can
say well we're 90 sure that this is a
good path
but if your
leader said ninety percent
then people would say oh ten percent's a
lot i'm not going to go that direction
you want your leaders to say this is the
way to go
well shouldn't we consider nope this is
the way to go but you know there's still
some risk nope this is the way to go but
you know the scientists are saying maybe
nope this is the way to go
now is that lying
would the leaders be lying
by giving you certainty
where there is no certainty
and the answer is yes
that would be definitely a lie
it also is the
the the foundation of all leadership
the foundation of leadership is acting
confident more than you are
because if you don't act confident
people aren't going to follow you
and the the fact is that the leaders are
guessing and you know estimating and
predicting and stuff so they're not
going to be right all the time but they
need to convince you that they are right
all the time you're not you're not going
to you're not gonna follow them into
battle with a 50 chance of winning
you want them to lie to you yeah we're
winning this thing we got this
so if you can't get comfortable with the
fact
um
that leaders have to talk uncertainty
and it's a lie
it's a lie anytime they talk uncertainty
but they have to
if you can't handle that
you know if you can't handle those two
things simultaneously then nothing makes
sense you'll be confused by the world
machiavelli's underbelly one of my
favorite follows on twitter
points out a story in the new scientists
so they took some human brain cells and
put them in a petri dish
and taught those human brain cells how
to play pong
what
what
they took human brain cells that didn't
know anything
and trained it to play pong
and then they put it in a competition
against ai
and they found out that although ai can
pong faster
the human brain cells were
quicker to learn on their own
so the human brain cells organized and
learned how to play pong
better than
artificial intelligence but once
artificial intelligence got there it
could operate faster
now here's uh uh
machiavelli's underbellies comment on
this
and i want you to like
just let this settle in for a minute
all right i'm going to tell you
something that won't maybe instantly
make sense just let us settle in right
it goes like this
based on this experiment
this is what the tweet was
we now know with 100 certainty that at
least one brain he's talking about the
brain essentially the brain cells in the
petri dish he's calling that one brain
we now know with 100 certainty that at
least one brain is trapped in a
simulation
all but guaranteeing that we too are
living in a simulation
i let that sink in
the
the brain cells and the petri discs
effectively since they're operating in a
coordinated manner
are a form of human brain
that believes that lives in the universe
in which the only thing that exists
is pong
and this brain cell
does not know
that there's a universe that created uh
this situation and and taught it to play
pong
the brain cell
thinks pong is reality and knows nothing
else and it's a human brain
now and then uh
do you do you like the second part of
this all but guaranteeing that we too
are living in a simulation now the way
it guarantees that is simply if you can
prove that it's true in one case
then you've removed the biggest obstacle
to understanding that there's a trillion
to one chance that we are a simulation
because because you first have to
believe it's possible
it's possible
that a brain could be in a simulation
and not know it
we have one
we actually have a brain in the
simulation that doesn't know it
so once it's possible
then you're just looking at the odds
okay well it's possible but what are the
odds that's where elon musk comes in to
help you with the odds i don't know if
you know this but
he's good at calculating the odds of
things
and he's especially good when he gets
them wrong
because he calculated the odds of
succeeding at tesla is very low
and that he did it anyway and the odds
of spacex succeeding he thought were
very low
and they did it anyway
so he's really good at calculating odds
and then ignoring them
and succeeding anyway so i don't know
what that means but his argument is that
if any simulation could be created
people would create them
and here we did
it could be done and there we did it
so those are the two biggest conditions
that get you to
a vastly greater likelihood that we're a
simulation it's possible and if possible
humans will do it
proven
it was possible
humans did it
well do you think we'll do more of these
do you think that ever again anybody
will do an experiment in which there is
brain cells trying to do something in a
petri dish of course
and then once you have the second
experiment
you would have two
human-ish brains
living in a uh let's say just for
simplicity a pong reality
compared to
one original species
so if we're the original species and we
created two simulations
if you were to transport into the center
of any of the simulations that exist
there's a two to one chance you're in a
fake one
by the time you create the second one
there's a two to one chance
that if you are randomly assigned to a
simulation a two to one chance you're in
a simulation and that's just with the
second experiment
after the millionth experiment
you can be pretty sure your simulation
and that's where we're heading
kind of a mind bender there
well anderson cooper was getting some uh
internet hate
because he did an interview with bill
gates and in the context of
asking about what kind of uh
let's say penalties could be put on the
public to make them get vaccinated
anderson floated the suggestion which i
doubt was his own suggestion i think it
was on you know the list of things that
maybe people are talking about he asked
bill gates about withholding people's
social security
should they refuse vaccinations now part
of the story is that gates laughed
nervously at that and then people uh
people
interpreted his nervous evil-looking
laugh as you know being in favor of
something
i would like to defend bill gates first
as i often do
by saying uh i'm i'm sort of the king of
the inappropriate laugh
when something is awful or just
non-standard
i laugh at it
and i shouldn't
but i always do
and so if i had been in this interview
and anderson cooper had asked me if
it was feasible or i thought it was a
good idea to take away people's social
security in other words their own money
you know ish
that's not quite true but been paying
into social security all your life and
then they take it away from you because
you don't get a vaccination if somebody
suggested that to me on national tv
i don't know if i could not smile at
that
could you
i think i would giggle at that
because it's so outrageous
and and what i saw in gate's reaction
was
sort of a reaction to the
the
maybe the extremism of it
like it's just kind of funny it's so
extreme
i don't i didn't recognize that as
bill gates saying oh yeah let's do some
of that
i mean i could be wrong maybe later he
will say that but i didn't interpret it
that way and only because you know
everybody
everybody generalizes from themselves
so if you said to yourself if i were in
that situation i wouldn't have laughed
probably true
you know yourself right and if you know
you wouldn't have giggled or smiled in
that situation you're probably right
but i'm telling you that if i were in
that situation
i would have giggled and smiled and it
wouldn't have meant to anything it just
would have meant it's an awkward
concept it just would trigger me
so just be careful about
generalizing from yourself i won't
assume that i can read bill gates mind
but i'll only ask you to do the same
all you know is that you had a reaction
you didn't understand that's all you
know
i wouldn't assume anything beyond that
but let's get to anderson cooper it was
suggested by people
that anderson cooper might be in favor
of this idea of withholding social
security if you don't get vaccinated but
indeed there is no evidence of that and
so the ap did a fact check and said no
he was just
saying you know what do you think of the
idea he wasn't saying he thought it was
a good idea and i accept that fact check
however
as i was about to tweet it
and defend anderson cooper because i
like to defend
everybody from fake news right it
doesn't matter what team you're on if
you're a victim of fake news i think
it's useful to point it out only so you
can learn it you know see the examples
and you know build a bigger
build a bigger library in your head of
where all this fake news comes from and
how they do it
and so i was about to jump in and defend
anderson cooper's uh
against this fake attack against him
when i realized
um
he's the one who spreads the fine people
hoax the drinking bleak chokes the
russia collusion hoax and you could name
a few others and i thought to myself
you know sometimes when the universe
demands justice
you have to get out of the way
and i felt like i don't want to be
fighting the universe
if the universe has decided that he's
spread so many dangerous hoaxes that the
universe is going to take him out with a
hoax i thought well
who am i to fight the universe
and so i
decided and so i decided that i would
remove myself from that fight at least
on twitter but i uh i'm explaining it to
you here
most people
i would have defended
i think i would have defended jake
tapper
i know i would have defended uh
smirkanish
i know i would have offended
sanjay gupta
in the same situation
and a few others you know i'm leaving
out a few but i wouldn't have defended
don lemon and i wouldn't defend
anderson cooper because they are hoax
spreaders so if they get taken out by
hoax
well
maybe the universe
has some kind of a compensated quality
we don't know about
you could call it karma if you wish
speaking of karma
have i ever told you that
being free of the sense of embarrassment
and shame is a superpower
i tell you that all the time
and it's a superpower which i
have
who would be texting me at this time of
the day
uh
let's see if something's blowing up nope
uh but jim cramer i think has this
superpower the ability to be wrong in
public
and not let it crush you
how many times have you seen me being
wrong in public a lot right but i keep
coming back
in order to do this kind of job
you know one of the talents in your
talent stack
has to be a thick skin
which seems ironic i know because i i'm
always fighting on
twitter but that has more to do with
managing the the brand and some of it's
just for fun
but
i probably handle embarrassment and
shame better than you know 99 of the
public because i practice
it's one of those skills that you could
practice believe it or not it's a weird
skill but if you get shamed and
embarrassed enough
yeah you just get over it
because none of it kills you
the shame and embarrassment is largely
an illusion
and the illusion is that the thoughts
you have of shame and embarrassment are
going to translate into the real world
and actually affect something
they hardly ever do
and once you've been shamed and
embarrassed enough
and you wake up in the morning and your
your bagel tastes the same
you're like well that's weird i got all
shamed and embarrassed yesterday and
today i woke up and nothing's different
if you do that enough
then you can learn to bring that feeling
into the present so you get shamed and
embarrassed it just seems funny
uh chris fields says yes our simulation
could have started millions of years ago
and we're just catching up that is true
so anyway back to jim cramer he uh
tweeted a photo of empty shells
shelves at a store
uh and the implication was and he said
he just said sub-optimal
meaning that it looks like a supply
chain problem
but internet sleuths were quick to
notice that every one of the shelves
that was empty was labeled for
valentine's product
meaning that it was the shelves where
they took off the christmas stuff after
christmas and they had not yet put the
valentine stuff on
in other words there was no supply chain
problem whatsoever at least in evidence
it was just they were changing out the
shelves so jim cramer imagining that
those empty shelves were telling him
something about supply chain i guess
tweeted that and then he just got shat
upon
yeah the the entire internet
opened up and started just peeing on him
now here's my question
did that ruin jim cramer's day
we don't know
what do you think
i'm going to say nah
[Laughter]
nope
nope
would it have ruined my day
if i had done that because when i saw it
i said oh god that's exactly the sort of
thing i would have done
in fact i did something like this the
other day by tweeting something that was
actually an old story
so you know tweeting old stories or uh
you know taking a picture of a empty
shelf and thinking it was meaningful
when it wasn't that's exactly what i do
i do that all the time
right
uh
and you know i get over it and every day
my bagel tastes the same
so my only lesson on this is be jim
cramer
right
you know when i see all these people
dumping on jim cramer and then i know
he's just gonna go to work the next day
and still be jim cramer
be jim cramer
let let the whole world piss on your
head and just get up and go to work
you'll be amazed how much it doesn't
matter
other people's opinions
are just things that happen inside their
heads it's just electrical signals
in the heads of strangers
that's what you're worried about
think about it just just think about it
right now let's do a little experiment
here's a there's a public hypnosis
experiment but don't worry there's
nothing nothing bad or strange going on
it'll all be transparent
just
go through this imaginary situation
every one of you probably right now is
thinking about somebody else's opinion
of you directly or indirectly
other people's opinion of whether you're
good or bad or right or wrong or
awesome or not awesome is always in our
heads
but imagine
those heads
just think of all the people who are
thinking something about you that you
don't like that's bad
those are electrical currents
firing inside
a piece of organic matter
in the skull of somebody that you don't
see and you know they're at some
distance from you
none of that matters to you
the electrical impulses firing in the
stranger's head
just don't matter
and if you think
that like like their thoughts are like
right on you
that their thoughts are getting in you
and it's it's like an infection
like oh the shame the embarrassment is
it's like in my body like i can feel it
just remember the only place is
happening
is in the electrical signals
somewhere else
you could just ignore it
and it's not easy to do but if you think
of it in those terms as just something
happening in another person's head it's
easier so that that's a reframe
so reframe it from something that's like
attacking your body there's just
something that's happening at a distance
it's not even touching you there's no
physical connection
so um you'll find that that's a useful
reframe
that ladies and gentlemen is
all i had to talk about another terrific
show one of the best ever no no the best
ever
best ever
and uh
i'd like to think that i made all your
worlds a little bit better today
i'm going to get serious about writing a
book about how to reframe things because
i there just are so many examples where
this is good
um
one example with the simulator's a
comment one example with the simulation
it's the stupidest thing i've ever heard
scott how many electrical signals go off
in your pants when you hear anything
about bill gates
well here's the
here's my take on bill gates
from from the moment he started getting
rich
he said someday i'm going to use all of
my money for philanthropic purposes
and that he did
like there's no doubt about it he's
putting his vast
wealth as well as his time and energies
into making the world a better place
now does he have evil intentions
i've never seen any evidence of it
now i've seen lots of
rumors that are out of context and all
that but i've never seen anything that
looked credible
now should there be
someday something credible do you think
i wouldn't tell you
if there were a credible report that was
just really bad about bill gates
do you think i wouldn't tell you
of course i would
why wouldn't i
because i'm i'm defending innocent until
proven guilty
i'm not defending bill gates
you know if you think of defending bill
gates you're missing the larger point
i told you i almost defended anderson
cooper
yeah but he was a special case because
he's a hoax person
but i will defend uh joe biden
even though i think he's a poor
president but if something is a fake
attack
or he does something well and i think he
did something well with court packing
for example
i'm going to say it
remember
my entire context is saying both sides
of every argument
so if you if you've imagined
that i have a pure love for bill gates
that cannot be shaken by data or
any kind of new information
well that's completely wrong
i'm just talking about what we know
right now and i'm leaving out well we
don't know that's not fair
does that mean i want to kiss him
you need to take your
take your analysis out of grade school
if i say something nice about a public
figure it doesn't mean i want to marry
them it really doesn't
all right
um
bromancing
anyway
uh that's all for today and i'll talk to
you tomorrow
