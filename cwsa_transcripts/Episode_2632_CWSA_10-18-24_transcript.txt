on the stocks they look uh nicely up
looking
good all
right I'm uh I'm wearing the green
t-shirt if you're just
listening I call it the full
ziny that's right giving you the full
zalinsky
today let's get some comments working
here and then it's go time for the most
amazing thing you've ever
seen today will be extra
special for reasons that only some
people
[Music]
know good morning everybody and welcome
to coffee with Scott Adams the highlight
of human civilization if you'd like to
take this experience which is already
pinning the needle and ways you can't
even believe if you'd like to take it up
to levels that nobody can believe but
they tiny shiny human brains all you
need for that is a CER muger a glass of
tanker chal ofin a canteen Jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee join me
now for the unparallel pleasure of the
dopamine head of the day thing makes
everything better it's called that's
right it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now go
it's going to every part of my
mitochondria I send my coffee directly
to my
mitochondria I don't know if that's
where it belongs but it's just something
I've been doing well meanwhile the
Florida housing market is crumbling
according to one report but then the
very first comment I saw in the X post
about it was that's not true
so if I told you that all data is fake
so either the Florida housing market is
crumbling or it's just fine because it's
the best date so I've got both opinions
there for
you but here's my opinion my opinion
somewhere in the middle which is here
are three things you don't want to
happen at the same time you don't want
to have a
state that has lots of hurricane
expense because that's going to cause
the second thing which is incredibly
High
insurance which is also going to be
related to a third thing which is you
have to move your entire house and maybe
repair it once every two years depending
where you live in
Florida how do senior citizens manage
that like how is it that the the one
state that's famous for having the least
most mobile you know least capable
humans are seniors you know with the
most respected but least physically
capable is in the place where we're
pretty sure there's going to be two
hurricanes a year that are going to get
your get you pretty excited so I do
wonder if you combine the uh the rising
Insurance costs which would be tough on
the people with fixed incomes especially
and then you add to it hey Grandpa
how many times do you want to pack up
the station wagon and figure out another
state to be in for a couple weeks or
live without electricity for a little
while now I'm in California so I expect
the lights to go any minute you know in
a forest fire to take everything so it's
not like you know it's not like I'm
bragging about my state or anything I
just
wonder if Florida is as sustainable as
as we hope it is it's got a lot going
for it D santis is doing a great job as
far as I can tell and a lot of people
love it they love the freedom but boy
I'd worry about the insurance cost mixed
with senior citizens that's a bad
one anyway according to something called
Futurity Futurity let's call it it could
be pronounced in many different ways it
could be futter idy probably not though
uh maybe Futurity
Futurity I'll go with that they say the
diet and ex exercise can reverse liver
damage now I would have to think that
that would depend how much liver damage
we're talking about and what kind but uh
once again I'm starting to get a
hint that good diet and exercise is good
for your health now I'm going to keep
track of this for the rest of you so you
don't have to but just in case it turns
out to be true the exercise and eating
right is good for your health in a whole
variety of ways I will get back to you
until then don't do anything rash don't
assume it's true just because 100% of
every scientific study since the
beginning of time has confirmed
it it might not be you never
know anyway there's another report that
Chinese scientists used their special
quantum computers yeah you don't have
one of those do you where's your quantum
computer losers no I'm just kidding
nobody wants a quantum computer unless
you want to crack military grade
encryption which according to Tom's
Hardware which I guess is a some kind of
a site um they've they've cracked
military grade encryption hm now do you
think that's true
put on your fake news
filter there's a report from China that
Chinese scientists have used quantum
computers to crack military grade
encryption so if that were true that
would mean that China already could have
full access to every digital system in
the United States military and
everywhere else on Earth already
here's the second part get ready if that
were
true do you think they would let you
know about
it do you think that would just be in
the
news how could that possibly be true
that would be the most secret thing of
all secret things that ever needed to be
secret in the history of
Secrets even even an alien Landing in
China and offering all of their
technology would be slightly less
secret than having their quantum
computers already be able to unencrypt
military
encryption so I'm going to be a little
skeptical whether they have that at some
practical level where they can actually
use it so I don't know what the real
story is but um that would the most
amazing part the story would be if it
were true that
somehow somehow it got out I feel like
they would just slay the
families of anybody who you know let
that secret out I mean what could be
more secret than
that speaking of electronic warfare
we'll get to all the fun politics in a
bit according to new Atlas there's a new
uh electronic warfare system that can
make it look as though there are lots of
jets and bombers coming your way when
they're armed so in other words they can
fool the enemy radar electronically into
thinking that there's something physical
coming at them in in a big wave now I'll
tell you when I read these stories I
can't tell how many of them
matter
um because if everything's just going to
be swarms of AI
[Music]
drones why would anybody use anything
else
you know it might be
mutually uh disaster destruction I mean
but it seems like that's the weapon
you'd use if you could make enough of
them because you couldn't really stop
them and they're kind of cheap you know
relatively speaking and you wouldn't
want to radiate anything if you didn't
have to so it seems like swarms of
drones would be the future but maybe
that's cool
too meanwhile us bombers struck Yemen
several hooti weapons Depot and stuff
and here's my question why why is the
United States in charge of
Yemen uh now I get that what we're doing
is good for the whole world and that's
my
point isn't everybody in the world
better off if the hoodies are not
blocking the shipping
lanes so shouldn't everyone be on this
in one way or another and if they're
not you know maybe it does make sense
that the United States is the the
world's police
person because who else is going to do
it on the other hand you could argue
that the hoodis wouldn't be mad except
for American SL Israel policies in the
Middle East but I'm not going to get
into that I'm just going to say that uh
it seems like everybody who wants to pay
lower prices would be in favor of the
United States striking the
hoodies and uh we should have more help
on that Argentina allegedly is having a
great
miracle Revival thanks to their new
president melee Javier
M um and they're they're saying it's a
now 10 months in a row in Argentina of a
trade surplus which would be miraculous
because they were trade deficit until
then and it's a six billion Surplus
since he took
office but you know what's missing in
the story is how he did any
that so how do you tell me a story about
the miraculous economic success without
mentioning anything he did or any expert
opinion as to why that worked or if it
would work somewhere
else so I would like to be the first
well maybe there are others but I'm
going to I'm going to put a little
skeptical flag on the Argentina stories
I feel like the Argentina
Miracle might be
overblown might be exaggerated because
there's just something missing in the
story you know there's a dog not barking
or there's a there's a key that's not in
the lock or there's a tumbler that
didn't fit or something there's
something about this Argentina thing
that's a little
too a little too convenient a little too
perfect
can can you really just change the
president and then the whole the whole
economy changes
overnight
really so I'm going to say there's
something going on in Argentina that
might be great so I'm not going to
criticize it at all I just think there
might be maybe more to the story you
know is there a debt question is there a
corruption competence question are they
faking the numbers is the data even true
we got a lot of questions it's a little
too fast little too good too fast you
know what I mean if you live in the real
world long enough you don't see this oh
let let me put it this way for those of
you who are over I will randomly pick an
age over the age of 50 and you've just
observed how a real world Works how fast
anything happens in the real world and
then you compare how you think anything
happens in the real world to the miracle
in
Argentina and do you think 20 years from
now the historians will say yeah damn it
it was just that one guy all you needed
was that one guy he did the right things
and now everybody just borrow those same
techniques and the whole world is doing
great now because once he made it
obvious that if you do those things
everything goes great and it goes great
immediately then everybody started doing
it do you think that's what it's going
to look like 20
years so here's one of those things
where age is absolutely a different
filter on everything if I were 25 I
would buy this
completely I would say wow you get the
right guy in the office and good stuff
happens if I were
25 at my current age I say nothing
happens that way ever so I've got a
question
um an overwhelming majority of Young
Americans worried about climate crisis
according to the
guardian so and apparently it's both
left and right leaning
kids so I don't see how you're going to
get a lot of uh human
reproduction so they don't have money
and they think that if they did have
money and the American dream and they
could buy homes and have happy lives and
stuff that um their children would burn
up in a fireball once they were
gone like why exactly would
anybody have any babies you know one of
the things that we don't like to admit
about our history in the United States
is that the single biggest well except
we had good geography and you know we
had some luck but a big part of the
reason that the United States has worked
for decades is that we do really good
brainwashing you know both on ourselves
and internationally as well and part of
the brainwashing was if you do these
things you get these outcomes and you
know you really want to have a better
toaster even though you didn't really
need a better toaster but hey your
neighbors have really good toasters and
look at all these features then you buy
it then the economy is good and then
people have jobs and just
self-fulfilling so basically the the
engine of any country unless you have
severe shortages you know as long as you
have resources the engine of any country
is the
psychology and the CIA who just managed
our country to make us all patriotic and
and just assume I I grew up watching
Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows
Best and so I just assume that what
people do is they go they get married
and you and in my I'd say 20s I felt
uncomfortable with the idea that I
wasn't rushing to get married because I
was so brainwash that there's just one
way to do it now I would argue
that if the brainwashing goes away you'd
say oh that's great my mind is free
everything's good now because I'm a free
thinker with less brainwashing I would
argue the only reason you survived is
because the
brainwashing and if you do too much free
thinking you're you're
dead yeah you pretty much need you know
somebody brainwashing people in some
stable productive useful
way I like Trump because when he
brainwashes to me you based on all my
filters on life he looks like he
brainwashes in a way that's
unambiguously good for you it might be
 but if he tells you the economy
is better than you thought you're going
to spend a little more and then the
economy becomes better than you thought
so it's all this really productive
 brainwashing that's just what I
love I'm like yeah tell me some more of
that I love it it's good for me
so you don't really get a choice of the
truth versus the lies you you kind of
get a choice of which brainwashing you
prefer by nearly a 2 to1 margin
according to
raspon uh voters say that a candidate's
competence matters more than
caring does that surprise you the voters
by a big margin 2 to one say they care
about confidence more than caring
because it seems to me that you know
comml is pushing the caring thing pretty
hard and the data would say that she's
pushing the wrong button that she should
be pushing the competence button but she
she doesn't have a competence button if
she had a competence button the election
probably wouldn't look like this but
here's the even more interesting thing
that the voters rated Trump slightly
higher than kamla on what do you think
I'm going to say now competence or
caring so Trump was rated higher
on which competence or caring trick
question
both Trump was rated higher on
competence and caring
how how does he
lose how's it how is it even slightly
possible that he could lose the election
I mean other than cheating we'll talk
about that in a minute but if if you're
winning on both competence and
caring let's talk about the third thing
we care about
um orange man bad like what's the third
thing you care
about if you got your competence and you
got your caring Now list the third thing
you care about nothing that's that's the
whole package if he's leading on
both now here's an interesting fact you
might not know what what would you call
it with one word that would capture both
competence and
caring this will be a good test give me
one
word that is a regular English word that
is the
definition of comp competence and caring
put together if you put competence and
caring there's one word for that
Charisma Charisma now slightly different
definition for Charisma which is power
and
empathy so I'm saying competence and
power are the same in this context and
I'm saying that caring and empathy are
the
same which means that
Charisma is literally what Trump seems
to have more of according to the voters
Charisma
now did uh did Trump demonstrate any
Charisma
lately here's what Charisma looks like
Trump goes to that uh what is that L
Smith uh big dinner that the
presidential candidates traditionally go
to k Harris does a recorded uh she tries
to do a comedy thing with somebody else
doing the comedy fals compl completely
flat complete disaster in a comedy
context and she just looked like she was
a fish out of water Trump gets up there
with a bunch of jokes that were written
obviously by his
staff he reads the jokes and as he's
reading him he's realizing that his
jokes suck and so he starts making fun
of his joke writers as well as the
jokes as well as the people in the jokes
cuz some people like the jokes and all
of a sudden it didn't even matter
what the joke was he made he made it
about just his personality and if he
liked his personality because he's you
know bigger than life then it was all
good so he took the worst material in
the world the jokes they were truly
terrible and he made the whole thing
work even even looking like it wasn't
working he made that work because he
talked about it not working and then
that became the thing he was talking
about Harris has all the production
Hollywood people in the world putting
together this nice little package so
that there could be no awkwardness no
mistakes she wouldn't be revealed for
having no sense of humor whatsoever
because the other person in the video
would be like adding the humor Parts
completely
failed so so who had the who had the
Charisma in that that case well not
exactly the definition of Charisma but
he was the more interesting he was the
star let's say he was a celebrity he he
was a star and Harris was
not
um then did you see that um Trump
visited a barber shop in New York City a
black barber shop and uh you may
remember that um I had been recommending
that Trump use his
Charisma on a retail level you know
instead of talking to people who are
professional talkers talk actual voters
because every time we saw him talking to
anybody in any kind of on the street
setting it was a home run am I right it
it was it was I I like to use the Frozen
rope analogy it's a baseball term if
somebody hits a hits a line drive that's
so hard it never goes down it's like a
frozen
rope every time every time Trump talks
to a voter it's a frozen rope I mean
it's just he just clocks it and you
never see it go down and so the obvious
thing would be we'll do more of that but
his super
superpower the superpower you just don't
see in politicians is his pirate ship
and when pirate by pirate ship what I
mean is that he can assemble people from
every Walk of Life and as long as
they're sort of you know philosophically
good Americans wanting to be you know on
the side of doing good things and
usually also liking him uh he loves you
and you can
tell and then you love him back because
you don't get a lot of love so he can go
anywhere and if you don't see that he
can go anywhere and and get the same
reaction you're missing his magic the
magic is it works
everywhere everybody can go to a
friendly audience even
even even
uh I'm forgetting the name I've heard KL
Harris's name incorrectly so many times
I'm starting to forget it but even she
can go to the you know the
19-year-old um female group of whatever
sorority and get a great reception
that's not hard Trump could go anywhere
just anywhere and he gets a great
reception so he goes to the black barber
shop which is of course of course you
know ratings gold and then I don't know
about you but the only video I saw was
from it looked like viral videos from
the the people who were in The Barber
Shop the
attendees and that's exactly what I
wanted to say I didn't want to see ABC
News camera here here is Trump
interacting with some voters I wanted to
see the voters take a picture of it with
their own their own cameras in their
hands and put it up on their social
media and say look what just happened to
me I'm in a barber shop with
Trump and that's what happened and it
was amazing it was perfect and did you
see the if you watched even a second of
it and you should did you see the the
comfort and
love that was so you know easily being
exchanged in that environment and it's
every
environment so you know hey Barber Shop
you're on you're on the pirate ship if
you know everybody wants
on get
on there's a study that says that
campaign Music Matters Mark Harvey
writing about this and where was that uh
I didn't see where he was writing it
but I guess he's an associate professor
and director graduate business programs
at the University of St
Mary um and he's he's a study this and
says that it does make a difference and
you can measure it and that associating
music such as when the candidates come
out before a rally or something makes a
difference now he could have asked me
and he probably could have asked you it
does make a difference but we don't
realize how much maybe it's more about
it's it's more dramatic than you think
because we are so t
and trained by music that music puts us
in a mode you you pair that mode with
anything and then you like the other
thing you know just
always
um
anyway so what one of the questions that
people are criticizing KL Harris for in
the Brett Bear interview was that uh
when did uh Harris know that Biden was
no longer capable of doing his job or
running for president and the Harris
just sort of avoids it at first she said
well he's not running for president and
blah blah he does a great job and
basically just avoided the question
awkwardly so I wanted to take a whack
because I like to uh no not in the
Jeffrey tubin way but I'm going to take
a try at being Comm Harris and answering
that
question so I'm doing this in the
context of persuasion training and
communication in general so do you think
that a more capable candidate could
answer the question you know why didn't
you say something sooner about Biden if
everybody knew that he was
failing so here's me if I were Comm
Harris and you asked me that question
this seems like a kill shot it seems
like a question that's like do you still
beat your spouse it just it just feels
like you can't answer this question but
watch me here's what I'd
say uh Mr Adams when did you first know
that Biden was you know not capable of
serving a second term and I'd say well
let let me say for sure I think we all
noticed there were some physical changes
in his movements and we all noticed that
and we also noticed that sometimes he'd
uh he'd need a little extra time to find
a word I think everybody noticed that as
well so what you were seeing in public
is same thing we were seeing but um as I
think you noticed in public as well we
were not seeing any impact on his
judgment in other words neither in
public nor in private was he making any
decisions or policy decisions that would
make any difference or that were there
in any way off-kilter from the consensus
in the room so we were watching very
carefully to see if his physic iCal
impact had any impact on his judgment
and I don't think anybody's even
suggested the situation where it has uh
I haven't heard anybody privately say
they thought his judgment was impaired
and I haven't heard it in public and I'm
not even aware of any any such thing so
I didn't see it we all saw that he was
physically losing it he was a certain
age we expected that at some level and
we were keeping an eye on it but having
said that it also seemed that the
physical decline couldn't be ignored if
we're looking at another four years so
if you're asking me do I think that he
has the mental and physical Acuity to
make it for the rest of the term I do I
think he has the best care in the world
he's being watched more than anybody in
the world because that's what presidents
do everybody's watching carefully he's
got tons of help and I'm still here if
something changed suddenly and all of a
sudden I saw that his judgment declined
uh there are steps to take care of that
we don't need to mention them they're
all well known but I can tell you in my
personal opinion I've seen nothing that
would alarm me about his judgment so far
it is however prudent and I think the
country appreciates that a younger
generation is probably a better
riskmanagement
situation and that's why I'm
here how was
that all right my only point is I think
that is an answerable question the fact
that she can't do it speaks to her
competence right because you could
imagine not the not a normal politician
most politicians wouldn't be able to do
it but you could probably come up with
five names of politicians that could
pull that off and she's just not one of
them
unfortunately all right Deon musk is in
h Pennsylvania he's already done one
uh prot Trump uh you know Pro voting
rally and uh he says
this um he said the US elections need
paper ballots and he needs hand counting
and inperson voting and voter ID he said
quote I'm a technologist I know a lot
about computers I I love the
understatement I'm a technologist I know
a lot about
computers now here's the part where I
think it's funny
that there will be 80 million Americans
who are going to say themselves I
disagree with Elon Musk on this question
of computers and
Technology now is that not
funny now I'm not saying that just
because he's you know the most notable
you know
technologist in the
world that doesn't mean he's right about
everything every time but this one's
just so obvious that he's right and he's
Elon Musk 80 million people are going to
say
nope no actually more people are
concerned about the election Integrity
uh than than is the mix of the country
so there's a majority who are actually
concerned so Elon goes on and he says
I'm a technologist I know a lot about
computers and I'm like the last thing I
would do is trust a computer program
because it's just too easy to hack it's
too easy to add just one line and it's
really difficult to hack paper
ballots and he goes on inperson voting
with ID which by the way every country
has I mean like almost every country
that has Democratic elections requires
iners voting with voter ID and then his
F he sums it up by saying it's super
weird to not have
that it's super weird to not have that
I love the summary it's super weird to
not have that because you really can't
figure out and he he you uses their word
they tried to to sell the weird thing
it's super weird not to have that
because it makes you wonder what the
reason is when he says it's super weird
not to have it your brain wants to argue
with them and say no it's not they they
do it
because and then you find out there's no
because which is my next boy
point and then he says uh the that the
uh Democrats are fighting paper ballots
tooth and nail and I wonder
why you go I wonder why they're fighting
the thing that we know works the thing
that everybody knows
works why are they fighting us so
hard
um is it because electronic voting
machines are cheaper no this is me now
not him is it because the machines are
more credible we trust them no obviously
we obviously we don't is it because
they're easier to maintain than
paper
no is it easier to train to train people
to use paper or to train people to
maintain the machines no paper's easier
uh is it safer from
cheating
no is it faster can you get a result
sooner apparently not apparently not so
here here's the thing as far as I know
no journalist and I'm going to put this
in quotes because we don't have any
journalists as far as I can tell who
have access to the right people we have
we have lots of great independent
journalists now but they don't always
have the same access to the same people
but none of the mainstream journalists
journalists have ever asked
anybody why electronic voting machines
are
used just just hold that in your brain
for a
second that the biggest question in this
election is whether it'll be fair and
rigged or or whether or not it's secure
and nobody has ever asked why given that
we know exactly the wrong way to do an
election and we know the right way why
do we do it the way we're doing it can
you please explain nobody's ever asked
the question except Elon Musk in the
Pennsylvania Val and me every other day
on
X anyway so here are some uh cheating
methods that are alleged to be available
in our current system now I'm going to
say
alleged because that's the only way I
can stay stay
monetized now so it doesn't matter what
I believe yeah so my personal belief
doesn't matter to what I'm going to say
I'll say that these are all things that
have been alleged in a way that I
haven't seen debunked to my satisfaction
so the allegations are not proven but
neither are they debunked to my
satisfaction based on my
knowledge
so uh here just just some things we know
about the number of dropboxes appears to
make a big difference in election
results which should not because it
should be the voters opinions that make
a difference not the number of
boxes uh nobody signed up for the number
of boxes system hey who's going to be
president well how many boxes are there
well um in 2020 uh Wisconsin had uh um
500
boxes but now they only have
78 oh okay so before when they had a lot
of boxes the Democrats would win but now
when they have fewer boxes maybe the
Republicans will win although as has
pointed out if someone is going to cheat
using any of these boxes meaning put in
ballots that are not real ballots or
harvest them or do that sort of thing if
anybody were going to misuse them they
could still find the 78 ballots boxes
you know the fact that they went from
500 to
78 isn't going to stop a motivated you
know person they can still find them but
the point is if the number of boxes
matters to the
outcome then what kind of a system do we
have what kind of a
system should it matter the number of
boxes on the sidewalks that collect the
ballots it's not a box we have a
republic if you can keep it not a not a
number of boxes
system as Insurrection Barbie notes uh
in account on X uh the number one reason
people distrust the election of 2020 is
because it came down to 40,000 votes in
four major cities and in each of those
Democrat Democrat controlled cities
removed Republican pole Watchers sent
home the media told they would told us
they would stop counting and then when
we woke up the following ballots were
counted and overnight without impartial
observers now so this is a claim from
Insurrection
Barbie so I don't I don't know who the
person is behind the account but is that
true th this is a it's a way of saying
what I've heard a million times but I'd
not ever heard it this way so i' I'd
always heard it in you know there are
some places in some swing states that
mattered a
lot but I but I didn't know that it was
four out of four major
cities and that they were the ones that
made the
difference is that is this an accurate
way to explain what
happened because if it
is I I have to admit that the entire
time I've been hearing the story because
I guess I'd been hearing it explained a
little differently like I I did know
here's the parts I knew I knew that in
at least one place they claimed there
was a water break and they counted
things overnight I thought I heard that
there was a second place that
happened but I thought to myself well
maybe they just took a a break and their
their story was that that other ballots
come in late at night and they just
counted them and maybe they shouldn't
have sent the people home but you know
beyond that that's all we
knew
so I would lack any direct evidence that
anything illegal happened so I haven't
heard the story with direct evidence so
if you're only using indirect evidence
you know kind of a statistical
thing I had never heard it described in
a way that triggered my pattern
recognition so if you just say we think
it happened in this place and then
there's a story that doesn't involve
water main breaking but there was
another place that countered him
overnight and by the way there were
several places that you know the results
changed overnight that sounds like this
sort of
loose you know thing that happened that
you really can't tell well if it
happened in several places I would say
to myself if it's in several places it's
just maybe how the system works because
it's spread everywhere but if you tell
me that the four key cities were the
four that had this very specific thing
happened if anybody had ever said it in
these exact words before it would have
completely changed how I thought about
it from day one and and I've read about
this story a hundred
times so if if this is the right way to
say
it boy does it look different in my
head Elon Musk commented on Insurrection
Barbie's um post and he said quote
sunlight is the best
disinfectant now I was probably Reckless
of him to say that because when you say
sunlight is the best disinfectant it's
only going to be hours before MSNBC
turns that into uh musk recommends
drinking bleach to cure electronic
voting
machines it's going to happen people
it's going to
happen it happened to
Trump all
right so I I uh I divided all the ways
that our election is susceptible to
cheating into three categories there's a
cheating before the election there's a
cheating during the election and then
there's the cheating after the election
right so let me go through the the three
categories of cheating now again I
believe of these would be available or
some would but they would be mostly
unavailable if Elon musk's plan of inv
voting voting in person with ID and um
doing it in one day Etc if all that
happened most of this couldn't happen
but some of it could like so before the
election we are inundated with fake news
that half of the country believes is
real news that's a big problem how in
the world do we depend on voting when we
have a system where half of the country
doesn't know the news isn't real I mean
it's literally actually not real it's
not even attempting to be
real when it when it comes to the
political stuff it's not really
attempting to be real now if half of the
country doesn't know
that and and our knowledge is what
drives the entire election you could say
that the fake news is is a rigged
election because the election is
irrelevant if you've brainwashed people
All in One Direction
now because it's also a free market
you've got your Fox News your breit
Barts and you know lots of independent
people who are you know balancing things
out but it's really about the
brainwashing
competition isn't it we think it's about
the votes but the real cheating happens
in the brainwashing so the cheaters are
the people who lie the most effectively
and the mainstream media is really good
at
it then there's the F data you you heard
that the crime rate numbers that were
allegedly down but everybody who had
eyeballs and lived in the real world
knew they were up they just got adjusted
up but not until not until after the
debate when Trump got fact checked and
now half of the country because they
believe news and they think data is
real and they heard it first they think
crime is down because Biden did a good
job it's actually way up 4.5% that's
that's a lot up
4.5%
crime that is a lot so we also know that
Google and meta are are allegedly gaming
their systems in big ways again what is
the point of having an election if the
information that you would use to make
your decision is all fake or biased or
anaak or manipulated or
algorithmically controlled
the election is the least important part
the decision is made by the brainwashers
and how effectively they
brainwash then you've got the uh states
that are trying to uh block the no
cheating laws so wherever wherever
somebody's trying to tighten up the
election laws so it's not easy to cheat
there are people working really hard in
the government to stop that so that it
is easier to cheat now there's always
some second reason like well uh that
would be
um disruptive or uh well we're not sure
you have the authority to uh you know
it's all it's always some technical
reason but coincidentally it all goes
toward the same direction of making sure
it's easier to cheat so now you've got
Georgia Republican party they're
appealing a decision because there some
stuff they wanted that got turned down
Fon County uh some they wanted some
stuff to make the elections more secure
got turned down Texas same problem
Florida same problem it has stuff to do
with like you know voter IDs and voter
roles being corrected and stuff like
that but in every case
where this seems like it's a really big
effect and there's an obvious
fix not
happening uh the daily wire says that
Michigan's voter roles list 8.4 million
voters but they're only 8 million voting
age residents in the
state now that's an allegation I I
haven't done the counting myself
now what's the point of having an
election with such a leaky system and it
gets worse um you know of course we know
the the mark Elias and the all the legal
Maneuvers that have happened in the past
and the presents make a big difference
in the effects um we know the lawfare
against Trump is of of course election
interference but it doesn't get counted
as such and the law fair could make or
break the entire thing I mean if the law
fair took Trump completely out what does
the vote matter so the law fair is just
election cheating it's just we call it
something different because it happened
before the election day but it's all
election
cheating and now uh the the judge has
denied the request to delay publication
of the evidence against Trump for the on
the January 6 case so that's all going
to be dumped right before the election
that's election interference because we
know that the the judges and the Das and
all these Soros Democrat people are just
doing every single decision it seems
like not everyone uh but it seems like a
lot of decisions are going against one
person and to me that looks like
election
cheating then during the election here
the
allegations uh allegedly in 2020 there
were a bunch of extra ballots printed by
a ballot printing company sent on uh
trucks to one place filled out by the
millions and then shipped off to be
counted there
is
seemingly a credible account that that's
exactly what happened and that there's a
door that won't be unlocked even though
the court has ordered it that has at
least some of all those fake ballots but
we're not allowed to look at them which
is enough to tell me it's true if if if
we had open up the door and you know
somebody checked I'd say oh okay maybe
true maybe not but if they if they won't
open the door after a court order still
don't open the door just to look all
they have to do is look at them and
they'll be able to tell if they're fake
I believe it now I don't know for sure
but if you're not going to open the door
I believe you're guilty government
government is always guilty until proven
innocent all they have to do is open the
door prove their
innocence but they don't do
it all right then the overseas ballots
uh obviously that's a gigantic hole you
can vote by email overseas without an ID
of course there will be cheating I would
imagine it will be
massive um how about the election
machines if Elon Musk thinks that
they're vulnerable
why would I doubt
him what about non-citizen voting some
Say it'll be there will be a lot of them
uh some say that someday there might be
a lot of them but only if they become
citizens and uh Democrats say well there
might be some but it's not any any big
thing because they know it's
illegal but there is enough suggestion
that maybe their names are being used or
they're getting ballots that somebody
could Harvest so I would suggest that
that's certainly a big hole but we don't
we don't know how big uh we got the dead
people voting the people move down the
state voting that's the problem with the
voter roles we know the voter roles are
a mess in a number of places um we've
got the possibility that the post office
could do Shenanigans and throw away
votes if they know they're from a place
that has more support from one candidate
how would you know well they say some
people in some states can check their
ballot to make sure it was
received how many people do that and if
they did do that would there be time to
fix any of it no if you checked and
found that your personal ballot had not
been delivered all you would be able to
do with that is is vote
again you just you know maybe vote in
person or send it another one if you
have time but it wouldn't stop any
process because you wouldn't even talk
to your neighbors and your neighbor
might be doing the same thing like oh
wow my vote didn't get in so you could
have massive knowledge that votes had
not gotten in without anybody knowing
that it's a massive knowledge that you'd
only know the way you knew and maybe you
had one coworker happen to but you
wouldn't know it was big if it happened
now I'm not I'm not saying I have
evidence that's ever happened I'm giving
you point that even if you had massive
allegedly hypothetically if you had
massive cheating there's no way to catch
it there really isn't you could catch it
maybe 20 years later after the fact like
like we think we know that JFK's
election was rigged but they didn't
catch it when it happened it always
takes too long everything gets certified
by the time you could catch
anything and then you got that kicking
out The Observers that could happen
again um and the late night counting
after The Observers are gone I suppose
that could happen again so that's what
you could do during the election ction
here's what you could do after the
election if hypothetically you had
rigged it if you had rigged it you're
still your part of the rig is after the
election because you got to You Got to
Hold Your Position and make sure it
doesn't get reversed so the first thing
you do is make sure that the elections
are not fully
auditable which is the case so there's
not really any practical way to know
that every vote got in and it and it
wasn't rigging
uh as Elon mus says if you change one
line of code where do you catch
that who's going to catch
that um how about uh the courts the
courts really really don't want to get
involved in election stuff they have a
you know sort of a reflex to be a
separate branch of government and not
have too much influence over the
elections and I appreciate that but it
also means they're going to
um they're going to be so so
slow that the president will be
installed whoever it is and they're
going to say that you have no standing
and there's a technical problem with
your case Etc and that might all be true
but my point is the courts are not a
tool that could be used in a short-term
of in a in a brief period between
election day and inauguration day
nothing could happen that fast in the
court system we don't have any kind of
court that can do that I mean you can do
a you can do an emergency Supreme Court
thing you could do that in time but they
wouldn't have any time to research you
wouldn't be able to do an
investigation nothing like that and if
you did you know that everything would
disappear oh the video of that Dropbox
we lost it which has happened that's
literally something that happened uh so
you could just delay after the election
and even if you were finding things and
even if you did investigate you would
find things it wouldn't
matter because we don't have a fully
auditable system nor do we have a second
line of protection which would be well
we we didn't fully audit it but we CAU
some sketchy things and we took it to
court that won't work because the court
needs way better than sketchy things and
it's not really the tool that determines
elections um and then of course the
Department of Justice would punish
anybody who protests so citizens would
helpless because if they protest they'd
be arrested that's what January 6 was
about to make sure that you knew that if
you disagree with the government they'll
put you in
jail um and the fake news would of
course rally around whatever result they
liked if they lik it and tell you the
election was fine and if you doubted it
you were a bad Citizen and possibly you
know some kind of conspiracy
theorist so here's my statement I would
like to make
publicly my public
statement don't design a laughably
ridiculous election system and ask me in
advance to accept the vot
count you could ask me to accept the vot
count if you had designed in advance a
secure system I would do that you could
ask me in advance would I accept it and
I would say yeah as you've described
that system that Elon Musk design system
where people show up and show their ID
and they vote on the same day yeah uh
I'll tell you in advance I trust
it but don't design a system which is
laughably porous laughably porous I mean
just absurdly porous and then ask me to
confirm it in
advance cuz that's just a little bit too
much signaling that you plan to RI
I mean you might as well just say hey
Scott uh I'm going to shove this all the
way up your ass until it comes out your
mouth but I'd like you to agree with it
in
advance the absurdity level this is
beyond anything that is even describable
it's indescribably absurd to ask people
to confirm in advance that they'll
accept the result from A system that is
designed like this this it looks like
it's designed to hide the
result that's what it looks like that's
I mean if you were if you were from
another planet and you didn't know
anything about politics and you said
okay you advanced advanced
aliens take a look at this system and
they'd say all right what are you trying
to do well we're trying to elect some
people and make sure that it's a secure
system you know so take a look at our
system they say well how you doing now
we say well we've got these uh
electronic machines that would and the
the alien would be who hold on hold
on you you mean the kind that you can
change with one line of code and we say
yeah yeah very secure and the aliens
would say what are you talking about you
just told me you could change it with
one line of cone how how many people do
you think have access to any given
machine well you know we check you know
and the the alien would just slap you
around and say are you kidding that's
your system that's your system for a
secure election but we've been
brainwashed into thinking we live in the
system where all the smart people are in
charge they they took care of
you they they they took care of the hard
things so you don't have to you don't
have to worry about the security of the
election because the smart people are
taking care of it it's boring it's
boring people don't even ask questions
you don't need to know why we do it this
way it's boring it's boring we'll just
take care of it
well let's talk about Trump on tariffs
The Wall Street Journal said this about
it that uh Trump's plan remains shrouded
in uncertainty he has called for an
across theboard Tariff of
10% later suggested 10 to 20% and at
least once even said 50 to
200% they go on he has proposed a tariff
of 60% on goods from China or maybe more
he has also proposed reciprocity or us
tariffs that match those of its partners
that should spare Mexico and Canada
which under us Mexico Canada agreement
negotiated in Trump's first term don't
change tariffs on the US but Trump has
separately said Autos from Mexico could
face or would face 100% tariff Mexico
imposes no tariff on us made AOS in
short they summarize in short no one
what no no one knows what Trump has in
mind
perfect it it's almost like he could
write a book called The Art of the deal
if you knew what he had in mind it
wouldn't work it's only the fact that
you think he might put a 200% tariff on
you that you're going to take him
seriously at
all the that this is this makes me laugh
because it's so
perfect this is exact actly what I want
Trump to do I want Trump to go in public
today and say maybe 10% maybe 200% maybe
50% maybe your cars Maybe not maybe
China maybe Germany maybe Russia I don't
know maybe 10% maybe 50% that's exactly
what I want him to do until he gets in
the room you know I mean the trade
negotiators you put the trade
negotiators in the room and the trade
negotiators play good cop and the good
cop says I you know
you you heard what Trump wants to do I
mean he wants to tariff you so hard he
loves tariffs you've never even met
somebody who likes tariffs as much as he
does he thinks it's a win every time he
does it I'm trying to talk him out of it
because I know it's bad for you and I'm
sort of on your side but damn I cannot
talk he loves the tariffs he can't stop
talking about it he wants 10 he wants 80
he wants 60 he wants cars do you see
what he said he's going to do in China
my God if you give me a great deal there
is some chance I can take it back to the
boss and talk him down on these tariffs
but you're going to have to give me a
lot you're going to have to give me more
than you've ever given me because Trump
is on the war path when these tariffs I
don't know how I'm going to talk them
out of it unless you really work with
me that ladies and
gentlemen is how it's
done all right uh the European Union is
at war with America um I think they
they're giving Apple a hard time they're
giving Tesla a hard time and his other
companies and uh don't have to free
speech in America directly and
indirectly um I've really sort of had it
with the European Union and uh I think
maybe we should just stop funding
Ukraine and let the European Union Fall
because if you're can attack the United
States we need to kind of send a message
don't attack our companies just back the
 off European Union now I don't know
if I'm going too far on that but anyway
so yeah European Union you're not my
friend poly markets you know the poly
Market betting Market um as I have been
trying to warn you betting markets are
not reliable when it comes to predicting
what's going to happen Trump has a big
um lead in the poly markets Market but
now there's a report that some big
accounts put in $30 million and they
look like they might even be related as
in it might even be one person or one
entity so it might be somebody gaming
the system or it might be somebody who's
rich who's just playing you can't tell
but you cannot you cannot assume that
the poly markets is telling you anything
useful have you all heard the hoax about
the Enemy Within and uh Trump going to
use the military to uh shoot or imprison
his political
enemies you you know I've been hearing
that for like what a week or something
and I've literally just been ignoring it
and the reason I ignored it is because
as soon as you hear it you know it's
based on something and a context and
it's a hoax and I thought surely I will
not have to get involved in yet another
hoax that's something taken on of
context but sure enough it's turned into
the major message coming from the
Democrats and from Harris and and their
claim is and and by the way I don't even
need to explain how it's a hoax because
as soon as you hear
it you don't even need it to be
explained do you really believe that
Trump said he wanted to use the US
military to get rid of political enemies
like Adam
Chef how many how many of you think
that's a real thing that could have
happened in the real world that maybe
just maybe has slipped out and he really
said that does anybody think that that's
the actual
that's the actual story that the idiot
 uh Harris is pushing on the country
I mean this is really cuntish Behavior I
mean you're just a piece of if you
do that because the the level of
division that that could create is just
off the chart now do you know the real
story so the real
story is that it's two separate stories
and they just put them together so
separate Story number number one is that
Trump did say that Adam Chef and some of
his cronies were the he calls them the
Enemy Within meaning that he considers
that they're external enemies you know
and and adversaries of course but that
he also has people inside our government
who are Bad actors now I agree that when
he's talking about Adam shiff he's not
talking about just a Democrat senator
who votes the other way Adam Schiff was
has been part of two major hoaxes that
by any reasonable definition were
attempts to overthrow the
government absolutely he is the worst
lying uh you know negative thing that we
have in the country so the first thing
is that Trump did say that that's like
an enemy Within I completely agree with
that anybody who knows what Adam Schiff
lied about from Russia collusion to what
the laptop to how many lies is that one
guy told that are really the dangerous
kind the the super dangerous kind yeah
absolutely there's an enemy from
within and what's wrong with
that it's pretty much exactly what the
Harris is saying she's saying trumps the
enemy she's saying that the the white
supremacist hiding in the mountains you
know they're the Enemy Within it's just
words everybody knows knows that what
what Trump thinks of Adam
shef he just reiterated what he thinks
he used those words Enemy
Within then
separately the question of if there was
some kind of you know Mass protest that
is related to the turnover of power uh
Trump said he wanted to make sure that
there was nothing dangerous happening so
he'd do whatever he needed you know
including if that meant calling in the
military but it would be calling in the
military to avoid all
danger it would be calling in the
military to make sure no Democrats got
hurt it's literally the opposite of
calling in the military to take out the
Enemy Within it would be bringing in the
military to make sure that everybody was
protected including the enemy with him
including Adam cheff meaning that the
military wouldn't say uh well you can
kill you know don't kill anybody except
Adam shff no the military would be
protecting Adam shff that would be the
job of the president and the military if
he called them that would be you know
last Last Resort now I don't think you
would call them because the probably the
National Guard could do the
job which he said but if you had to call
in the military to keep the peace
wouldn't it be nice to have the option I
mean you could argue that maybe you
should never do that but uh it's
certainly the right instinct to reduce
the level of violence so then Harris
puts them together and makes it act like
but she does it with she tries to
convince you with her face and her
crying so instead of saying I think
Trump wants to use the military to uh
shoot
Democrats she does it like this he wants
to but but he wants to he wants to bring
the
military the military people the
military and and she just makes it act
like if I say it with a more tortured
face it'll be more believable and so she
takes liar face to the highest
level he wants
toow very
convincing
anyway I wanted to mention that uh if
you if you heard that Jim Gaffigan who
is the comedic host at that L Smith
dinner thing that Trump was doing the
jokes at um he did he did poke at Harris
um sort of that her package wasn't funny
so to speak but uh then he said this
joke he said the Democrats have been
telling us uh Trump's reelection is a
threat to democracy in fact they were so
concerned of this threat they staged a
coup ousted their democratically elected
incumbent and installed K Harris he said
sometimes prayers take three and a half
years and George Clooney uped now
if you heard that completely out of
context you would say to yourself um is
he a trump
supporter because the main claim the
single biggest claim Democrats are
making is that Trump is the one who's
going to steal your democracy and
Gaffigan's joke does what jokes do often
is they reveal a truth that the
Democrats are the one who have
demonstrated a willing this to steal
democracy and just did it right in front
of you now if you didn't know anything
about
anybody you would say that's a very prot
Trump person who's sort of sneaking in
probably one of the most powerful Jabs
you could ever make at the Democratic
brainwashing operation that the whole
steal your democracy is is projection
basically I mean b he doesn't say it's
projection but he's saying it's
projection now I would like to give you
a little behind the scenes
knowledge so um I know Jim Gaffigan a
little bit I worked with him on a
commercial for Barnes & Noble many years
ago when neither of us were very well
known and uh I thought that he might
have remembered that he worked with me
one day so when he got much more famous
and I was at a show of his in
Vegas um with my ex at the time I
thought hey I think I'll see if I can
say hi to him after the show so I uh
handed a note to the one of the ushers
and I said hey um I'm so and so I think
I told him I was a creator of Dilbert or
something and uh I said I know Jim
gaffan can I say hi after the
show so uh he gave him the note and then
the message came back yeah he says come
on back now here's what I didn't know at
the time he did not remember that he'd
ever met
me but apparently he liked Dilbert
and he he thought oh the dilber guy
wants to say hi that' be fun so my ex
and I went backstage afterwards and uh
when we figured out oh you don't
remember me it was just like that was
funny so that we talked uh a little bit
about politics because he was apparently
aware of my trump um support at the time
this was the first election so this is
back in the uh
2016 and so we had this long
conversation about politics listened
listened very um politely respectfully
to any opinions I had didn't really push
back on anything um had his own opinions
which you know are his opinions so it's
not for me to give them but here here's
what I can tell you I have no idea who
he who he supports I have no idea and
that's my compliment to him if you can
talk to somebody for you know I don't
know an hour and a lot of it's about
politics and when you leave you're not
sure who they're going to vote for
that's pretty good that's pretty good he
was very honest about what what um holes
in his own knowledge he had you know
there's some things I knew that he
hadn't heard he absorbed it all he had
genuine curiosity he wasn't you know he
wasn't mocking me or putting me down for
my opinions which you might expect from
somebody who you assume would be
Democrat leaning and I think he is
actually but I don't know like if I had
to
guess probably lifelong Democrat but
could be a Republican and that's my
compliment when you say that people are
Independents you rarely mean it right
there aren't real Independents people
who actually might vote one way or the
other depending on what makes sense he
might be he he might be the real deal so
I don't know I don't know but this joke
is um if you didn't know that he's a
genuinely
open-minded person who's seeking reality
which he is I can confirm that he is
seeking
reality um it might had different but I
I think he would hit both sides with
equal Gusto and I don't think this
reveals anything doesn't reveal anything
about his who he would vote for because
he might have equal equal complaints on
both
sides well you probably heard that
Israel uh they say they got lucky some
people say it might have been more
planned but um sinir the head of
Hamas and the person who was most
responsible for everything I guess
including October 7th uh has been killed
in an
operation and um so a lot of people are
speculating that that will change things
because once the the main person behind
Hamas is dead and probably a lot of
their lieutenants and underlings are
dead as well that it might be time that
Hamas would say hm maybe we should talk
about exchanging these prisoners for a
ceasefire I'm here to tell you forget
about that nothing like that's going to
happen they're not going to get more
flexible because you killed their
leader it's like if you've paid no
attention to the Middle East ever you
might think that but no killing
somebody's leader just about never makes
things better just about never but if
you kept killing the leaders and you got
down several layers of capability well
then it can make a difference you know
I've speculated before that the the top
two or three people in any successful
organization probably make a big
difference but once you get to that sort
of that fourth you know then then uh you
know chance comes into it but what are
the odds the fourth ones
like a superstar because in order to
make something like Hamas or Al-Qaeda
work you know with limited resources and
everything somebody at the top has to be
really good at whatever they're
doing and if you get rid of the top two
or three you're probably not going to
have somebody who is good as good as the
founders probably not right so I think
Israel is moving in the right direction
Netanyahu said Hamas will no longer rule
Gaza um so they're very clear that uh
all of hamos has to be dismantled um it
looks like the only the only idea that I
saw that sounded feasible is that you do
what I called U years ago I called it a
filter
fence that if you can't if you can't
bring peace to the population the way
the population is and you can't kill
them all because you're not monsters um
the only thing you can do is create
peaceful zones that are entirely gated
and then let in the people that you know
are safe but only if you know they're
safe like babies
yes so just really really really
carefully know they're safe and then you
build a safe community and then you
expand the number of safe ones but
you'll always have this mixed one that
you're trying to shrink which has a lot
of bad people in it and you keep trying
to you know whack them all the bad ones
but you know they're going to come back
and then eventually you build some
communities where people have something
to hope for something to live for
something that's working out something
you can make peace with and then you
could talk about the politics but you
can't really just pacify it the way it
is you you can't just say all right
Hamas it looks like uh you got nothing
but Rubble so uh make a government we'll
see if nothing like that's going to
happen so the I think it was Petraeus
who described the idea of you know
building the walled cities that are safe
and only letting in the safest most
vetted people and then once in you make
sure you control the schools because
you're going to have to control the
brainwashing to make sure they don't
radicalize just over the Internet or
something so that's going uh Ukraine's
government according to the Brussels
signal uh they're alarmed by Rising
desertions so the allegedly the first
eight months of this year they had
46,000 uh soldiers
desert uh some say it might be
more but here's my
question if you were a Ukrainian or
Russian
soldier shouldn't you
desert you should desert right away
because the war is
over the war is over it's going to be
something like the current borders
and if you give your life for the status
quo you're an idiot why would you give
your life for the status
quo Nobody Does that so desertion is the
number one thing you should do now I
suppose if only one side deserted
massively then the borders would change
but I feel like the ukrainians and the
Russians should be talking to each other
at the fighting
level at at the soldier level they
should be making a deal for a mass
desertion on the same day and just both
sides do it because you know I'm sure
that the the the officers would you know
try to have you killed for deserting but
not if you all do it if everybody
deserts and just says hey I'm you know
we're done our leaders have completely
failed us and we don't need to wait four
months for Trump to do something let's
just
desert now of course that could never
happen
or could it my point is if you every
person who dies from you know from
really a while ago but everybody dying
from now on is completely wasted you you
can't make an argument that it was
somehow to somebody's benefit it was
just poor Management on both
sides poor management is killing people
it's not
Russia you know Russia is the the maybe
the tool that's killing them but it's
bad leadership that's killing people
because nothing's going to change in the
borders so it's just a a
leadership death trap that ladies and
gentlemen is my prepared remarks for
today I thought it was awesome I hope
you enjoyed it and I'm going to talk to
the local subscribers privately by the
way if I haven't told you the local
subscribers get my mancave broadcasts my
pre-show broadcasts my brief after
comments they get the robots read news
comic they get uh Dilbert reborn comic
every single day oh here's a funny
thing so on uh if you're a local
subscriber or also if you subscribe on X
to the Dilbert reborn comic um I I give
you both the current one that I did you
know a few days ago and then I give you
one that was 10 years from the
publication date 10 years earlier
and both of them are about robots today
so 10 years ago the comic was about a
walking robot that was the supervisor of
Wall-E and this week 10 years later we
see the uh we see the Optimus robots
walking and right on the verge of taking
jobs so 10 years ago I was basically
writing comics for today that's weird
