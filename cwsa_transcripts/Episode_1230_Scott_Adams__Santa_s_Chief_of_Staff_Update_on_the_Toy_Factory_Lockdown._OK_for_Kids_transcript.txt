hey everybody come on in here
this is an important update important
update
as you know that we're in the middle of
a pandemic
and here's an update from santa's
workshop where there
had been threats of a lockdown
for quarantine purposes i'm going to
give you an update
i've just heard uh in from the north
pole
so this is fresh from the north pole and
uh
if you're wondering what role i have in
all this
i do a little seasonal work
and specifically i work for santa
just during the high season and i work
as his chief of staff
santo normally would be making this
announcement himself
but i'm here to tell you unfortunately
santa has been diagnosed with the
coronavirus
that's right santa does have the
coronavirus he's quarantined
we think he'll be fine we're we're
he's getting the best care all the best
therapeutics but we are worried about
them because
santa does have some comorbidities
santa is first of all thousands of years
old
and we know that age could be a factor
in your outcomes with coronavirus
santa also has high blood pressure
diabetes uh he's
more mortally obese and obviously
he's black all of those have an extra
risk factor
but we feel that santa will be fine
unfortunately
santa will not be able to deliver
gifts this year don't worry don't worry
i'm getting ahead of myself
we do have a substitute so so the
the toys such as they are they will be
delivered
i'll tell you about that in a moment um
but it's worse than santa having
coronavirus uh
you know coronavirus is very
it's very transmissible and one thing
you might not know
is that elves are very bad
as social distancing have you ever been
around an elf
they will not socially distance you can
get them to wear the little masks
fine but you get you get near them
and i tell you they're all hands the uh
the the toy factory when i walk through
the toy factory
i mean right now i'm working remotely
because of the coronavirus
but when i visit the toy factory and i
walk through
i'll feel something rubbing on my leg
it's an elf they cannot socially
distance
it's like they're great at doing their
job
you tell them to make a toy wow
an elf can knock out a toy like you
can't even believe
but socially distance it's like they
can't even do it so
most of the elves also got the
coronavirus
and they also are socially distancing we
think they'll be fine
santa will be fine don't worry about him
he has the best care
and the elves we think the elves will
also be fine
everybody will be fine but they can't do
their jobs right now and
timing's kind of critical but here's the
good news
here's the good news your parents aren't
going to brag about this
but this really happened kids
your parents all of them volunteered
to help making toys because the elves
couldn't because of the coronavirus
so that's the good news the bad news
have you ever seen your parents try to
do stuff
not so good have you seen your
father try to assemble furniture
even when he has the directions you see
where i'm going with this kids
how about your mom's cooking is it great
every time
maybe not well your toys this year
they're going to be a lot like that
furniture your dad can't assemble and
the food that your mom makes
that you wish maybe she wouldn't
so not all of your toys will be perfect
this year
a little bit imperfect and it's only
relative to the elves because as i said
the elves the elves have been doing this
for a year
how many thousands of years right the
elves
can knock out a toy from beginning
design to end bam i once saw an elf
this is true i once saw an elf make an
entire video game
programmed it from scratch five minutes
it's true now how about your parents
kids do you think they could make an
entire
video game in five minutes i don't think
so they are not
elf standard if if i can put it that way
so you might want to lower your
expectations
about the toy quality but delivery we've
got
we've got delivery covered um you've
heard the story of rudolph
uh he's our red-nosed reindeer he's he's
a lot like the other reindeer
but if you haven't heard the story he's
got this red nose
and it glows and because of the glow
at one point he was sort of ostracized
which is
meaning that the other reindeer were
kind of mean to him
but they realized wait a minute
what if it's foggy out or we need a
little extra light
wouldn't that yeah you see where i'm
going with this the light
from the nose would be like a headlight
and so rudolph became sort of a star
among the reindeer so kids if you
haven't heard this this is all true
and when santa needs a replacement let's
say
santa is sick like now we don't know if
he's sick
but he's got the coronavirus
the natural person who steps in is
obviously who would it be is it going to
be donder
and vixen no no leadership
donder vixen nothing they're pretty much
just workers
but rudolph rudolph stepped up and
rudolph will be
in charge of the delivery this year so
kids don't worry
all the gifts will be delivered there is
a little bit of drama
among the l the the reindeer
and uh i'm not gonna lie it could be a
problem
and it comes down to this because
rudolph
is sitting in for santa
he wanted to actually sit in the sleigh
right and imagine how that went over
with the other reindeer
and the other reindeer are like are like
wait
uh rudolph just because you're sitting
in for santa
i i don't think that means you sit in
the sleigh and we have to
drag your your lard all over the world
and deliver why don't you maybe pitch in
you could use that old red nose right up
front
could come in handy you could maybe just
join the rest of us
and be like a regular reindeer but also
in charge
you know you would still be in charge
but you would just be
like helping pull the sleigh instead of
sitting in the back
and rudolph
starting to get ahead about things like
you give you give
a reindeer a little bit of attention
you give them a little bit of attention
it goes right to their antlers
and the next thing you know rudolph
rudolph's just he's got his
little uh arms closed little hooves and
rudolph's back there and he's like
uh i don't think you heard santa
he's santa put me in charge in charge
meaning i'm the boss of all of you
reindeer so let me explain to you
ordinary reindeer with your dull little
noses that
have no value whatsoever nothing
let me explain to you what it means to
be in charge
being in charge means i tell you what to
do and then you do it
being in charge is not you reindeer
telling me
or rudolph what to do well that's not
how it works
no i've been i put in the work
a little extra work if i i don't i don't
want to brag but
i did a little extra work because you
know
this whole lighting the way with my nose
that doesn't happen on its own
that takes a little extra work and now i
got selected as the leader the
replacement for
santa for just this one season and
i don't mind sitting in the back
where the leader belongs so at the
moment
they're uh they're in uh some kind of uh
talks about this and uh
[Laughter]
how dare you suggest that i'm drunk i
actually don't drink
uh santa's chief of staff does not drink
i'm sorry so
here's the bottom line kids santa got
the coronavirus but don't worry because
rudolph will be doing the delivery
the elves they they got wiped out with
the coronavirus they'll be okay but they
have to be quarantined
your parents will be doing the the the
toy making
but not very well because you've seen
the work your parents do if you know
what i mean
so that's your update for today i hope
that all of you have a great christmas
i would say there's a strong 50 chance
that the gifts will be here on time
and let's all hope that rudolph
pulls it out rudolph rudolph rudolph
rudolph come on kids join me rudolph
rudolph rudolph
i feel like maybe i'm the only one doing
this kids
kids come on rudolph
rudolph fruit okay i still feel like i'm
the only one doing it i don't know
all right well that's all for this night
and that is your santa
toy factory update
you
