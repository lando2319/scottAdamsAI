okay everybody will you look at all that
smoke out there in california
look at that sky it's full of smoke
no it isn't it's a trick
that's actually fog because
ordinary day no today is not like any
other day
while you thought that was fog nope the
air quality went from 160 to
26 in the last day that my friends
is not smoke it was actually blue sky
yesterday
and today for the first time in
approximately
a month i'm going to do something called
wait for it going outside
yeah i had a little medical
surgery stuff so i couldn't do any
exercise for several weeks
and as soon as i was ready to go back
outside
the forest fires hit and then the air
quality was too low to exercise outside
but last night i don't know if the wind
changed or what
but we went from pretty darn bad to
not looking so bad i think this is just
fog should clear up a little bit
anyway this is not the only
thing that's starting to go right what
you're seeing
is the third act of all third acts
there's something happening can you feel
it
this is not like other days there's
something happening
it's everywhere it's in it's in a
million different ways and a million
different
things things are almost
waking up it's almost like the people
and
the stuff and the systems are becoming
almost sentient
and you're going to see a lot of things
that were going
wrong start to go right
let me give you some examples
we'll talk about those uh over the
course of the next few minutes but i
wanted to do first
some fact checking and corrections
so uh yesterday i had two uh
two really astounding mistakes
so let me collect correct them both
number one mistake
is that i incorrectly said that uh
gavin newsom governor of new york and
kimberly gilfoyle
shared a child i've been corrected that
it's kimberly's child from a subsequent
marriage
so that's number one correction number
two
have i ever told you that i don't have
uh the capacity for embarrassment
anymore i used to
i used to be embarrassed at everything
but i've somehow learned
to do incredibly embarrassing and stupid
things in public
doesn't bother me a bit and it's a
really good superpower you should try to
develop it
this is a perfect case in point
i don't know if this is the stupidest
thing i've ever done in public
but it might be it could totally might
be
let me tell you this so we'll get to the
simultaneous step so
yesterday i think i said it on uh
on another podcast as well so i have to
correct that later
i said that there was a map of
california that showed all the fires and
i
cheekily said why did the fire stop at
the border of canada
it must be that they do better forest
management
because otherwise obviously there would
be slop over into canada
and i felt pretty smart about that
pretty darn smart
if i if i do say so myself it was
insightful it was insightful
uh but there was one little problem
with that insight which was pointed out
to me by
literally everybody with a brain
you know what the problem was right it
was a problem it was a map
of california fires so it only showed
the the fires in california
because it was a map of california fires
it showed canada on the map but it
didn't care about them somebody followed
up and showed me a map of canadian fires
that show no fires in california to
which i said
oh not my finest moment but
before we get into more of that what do
we need more than just about anything in
the world i think it's a simultaneous
sip
and all you need is a copper bug or a
glass attack or chelsea stein a canteen
drink or flask of vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopamine the other day the
thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and we are in the middle of the third
act folks
coming to the other side sit with me go
oh so good
all right uh rasmussen has a poll coming
out
in about i think uh two hours
um i won't tell you what the rasmussen
poll
says but if you like your president
trumps
i think you're gonna like it so look for
the rasmussen poll
good news that's all i'm gonna tell you
i made a a cheeky comment
on twitter that i would like to repeat
rarely rarely in the course of anybody's
life
do they get to say something like i'm
gonna say
and here it goes i wrote a book called
win bigly you can see it on the shelf
behind me if you're watching
and it's a book about how to persuade
and it was specifically about president
trump's skill for persuasion and
um woodward in his book
and i think in part of his audio tapes
or something
noted that um that jared kushner
had told woodward to read win bigly to
understand the present
better and
um so now we know that
you know jared read went bigly i happen
to know a few other people in
the white house who have read wynn bigly
now win bigly
is a book that would teach you how to
persuade somebody to do something that
they had not done before and maybe
didn't want to do before
and it looks like maybe as many nine
countries in the middle east
will be signing peace agreements or at
least agreements which
effectively are peace agreements now
i am not going to say that if i had not
written that book that we wouldn't get a
good result
because the way it works and i think we
all agree on the rules
the rules are the rules the boss gets
the credit
because the boss also gets the blame
right it's just sort of how it works
so obviously president trump gets the
credit
he's the one who brought in jared he's
the one jared brought in his staff
so the president gets any credit for the
middle east but
it is kind of hilarious kind of
hilarious
that my book was out there at the same
time did it make a difference
no way to know i won't make that claim
because
there's no way to know but it is funny
and
i couldn't help i couldn't help
[Laughter]
but mentioning it all right
so i can't guarantee that everybody who
wins win bigly my book
will uh create peace in the middle east
all i can tell you for sure is that 100
of the people who did read it
did make peace in the middle east but
that doesn't mean it's
causation all right um
here's the funniest thing that's
happening right now
the president did a lot of things or was
accused of a lot of things that later
became
you know falsified but for whatever
reason
and i guess the reason is the way people
are wired they don't really
learn from their mistakes meaning that
you would have thought if you lived in
some kind of a rational world
you would have thought that when
democrats found out that russian
collusion was completely made up
just completely made up and it was
almost a
an overthrow of the government if it
worked you would think that people who
learned that
about their own side would say whoa whoa
from now on i'm not going to trust my
side because they just did the biggest
prank in the world
with this russia collusion hoax but you
observed that that did not happen right
instead uh and i'll bet you've
experienced this
they would say no it's been proven and
you'd say
no that's the opposite of what happened
it was proven
not to exist or at least you can't prove
something's a negative but
no evidence was found and then you've
been down this
hoax funnel before people will retreat
from
okay okay they didn't find collusion per
se
but a lot of people went to jail and
then you say
for different reasons for different
reasons
and then they say well but what about
that russian troll farm they were
certainly interfering
and then you say no that's a different
conversation
we were talking about collusion
not a russian troll farm made a few
memes that looked like a sixth grader
made them
that did happen the collusion
did not now what do people say when
you've taken them the hoax
you've debunked everything they've said
you've agreed that russia did some bad
stuff
during the obama administration what do
you
what happens next you know what happens
next
they'll change the subject and then if
you
circle back to them in a week and you
say well
you know as we discussed last week
there's no russian collusion
well they say yeah that's what we
decided last week
nope never
not once will you see this happen what
will they do instead
they'll say there was russian collusion
there were those russian troll farms
and what about those people who got
arrested it will be
as if the conversation never happened
right you've all been there i'll bet
every one of you has had that
conversation where you go down the hoax
funnel and then they just change the
subject and circle back to the top of it
in a week like it never happened
but there are some topics that are so
big and so stark that maybe you can't do
that
and this middle east business looks like
it would be that
but this morning i was looking to see
how the the tortured souls would try to
explain why this is happening and i'm
seeing people saying
how could it be a peace deal if israel
wasn't at war with bahrain
how could it be a peace deal if israel
isn't at war with
saudi arabia what kind of peace deal is
it
if it's the uae we're not nobody was at
war with the uae
well that is you know the the child's
view of what's going on of course
but they found something they found
something
however i would argue that the
overall the middle east stuff
is so obviously good
and so obviously only because of trump
and his team you know jared's team it's
only happening because of them
that is hard to escape it's really hard
to escape
and it is also hard to escape that all
the quote smart people the john brennans
of the world the
all the critics have criticized this
president
on every single move from killing
solomony to canceling the
iran deal to moving the embassy to
recognizing the golan heights just one
thing after another it's a mistake it's
going to cause us trouble
and i've been telling you since the
start that those were
all the right things to do to get the
result that they get
i will remind you what i was saying when
these were happening
by creating a situation in which israel
wasn't negotiating for peace
but rather just taking what they wanted
i think we'll move our embassy
i think we'll take the golan heights i
think we'll just
declare some territory over here and
that's your territory and this is ours
what i said was as long as israel was
getting stronger
and nobody else was i mean at least the
palestinians weren't
but as long as israel was doing great it
would create this situation
where it looked like they better do a
deal quickly because the quickly
the faster they do the deal the faster
they can
you know lock in some benefits for
themselves because israel was just going
to keep marching
they were just going to keep doing
whatever they wanted to do and they were
thinking well
maybe this is the time so i would argue
that the president set up
exactly the right situation and set the
table
perfectly by by not being the way we
used to be
for one thing shaking the box working
the people
uh and i think that they also probably
made a good story about what's in it for
everybody
so i think the story that jared started
out with was
look how good you could be doing you
know you won't always have
oil right that's the thing that the
middle east is worrying about now
wait a minute maybe oil isn't going to
be the future because it isn't
so now they have to figure out how to
cooperate because they can't just say we
don't have to cooperate
look at all our oil if you want oil
well you're going to have to do what we
want and now
when it's obvious so we'll get to a
point not too long
where we don't need oil as much and and
also the president's uh making the
united states independent
energy independent was a big part of
that so i would say every part of this
this the president set up and set the
table
and congratulations to everybody who
made that work
so what would have happened
if everybody who gave president trump
advice
about the crown prince of saudi arabia
and that ugliness with khashoggi
what would happen if the president had
taken all of their advice
all the smart people every smart people
the people on the left there were some
people on the right
pretty much it was just everybody
against trump
as i remember it and they said no no
you've got to come
much harder on saudi arabia what did i
say
what i said was you can't make that guy
come back alive
right khashoggi's dead you can't make
him come back alive
but here's what you can do you can make
saudi arabia owe you a favor
you can do that and that's what the
president did he created an
asset out of nothing because it wasn't
you know he
wasn't his actions that killed khashoggi
it just happened because of saudi arabia
presumably
and the president took that opportunity
to say
what if i go the opposite direction stay
good to him
how much does he owe me for getting it
for having his back
no i don't know if they ever had a
direct conversation about that
but do you need to do you need to have a
direct conversation
when somebody has your back in a major
way
i mean in the world of having somebody's
back
that you've never seen anything like
this this is the gutsiest thing
you'll ever see probably in public so
the president had
had the crown prince's back on that
for good or bad you might think that if
you're looking that in isolation to be
the worst thing in the world
i'd probably agree in isolation
it's just about the worst thing in the
world i mean really it's just about the
worst thing in the world
you know dismembering a guy but
the president figured out how to turn it
into an asset and
the larger benefits could be quite
impressive it will never pay for the
life of a person
exactly but he did capitalize on what
was there
all right um
here's some more on other things
so it feels to me there's also a change
coming
so you're seeing the you know the the
change with the middle east
uh you're seeing that the rasmussen poll
is showing that people are having a
different opinion about
the president i believe that the longer
the protests go
the more people's minds about them will
shift toward
increasingly negative they're already
negative but even increasingly so so
that's another shift
and i think that um critical race theory
has probably been surfaced to the point
where more people know what it is
and then also debunked by at least some
portion of the public
even though some still like it so i
think there's just a lot
happening big big big changes
in the way we're thinking about stuff
there are big changes in the world
but also in the way we're thinking of
things
um and here's one of the changes there
was a story in of oregon
got caught on film where a woman caught
a guy trying to set fire
it looked like allegedly he had some
matches and he was trying to set fire to
some forest on her property it looked
like
and she caught him she had a gun in the
car
she pulls him over and she she held him
until he was arrested
he said he was going to go for a smoke
but he didn't have cigarettes
right he just had matches and he was
trying to light her forest
now how do you feel about climate change
when you know that they keep arresting
arsonists every time they arrest another
arsonist
climate change doesn't look quite the
thing that you thought it was before
every time you hear people like michael
schellenberger and you know
others now saying quite loudly that
forest management is the big thing
and if you took care of that it might
still get warmer
it may still get warmer but it won't be
the forest fire problem if you take care
of the uh
the brush but watching a citizen
arrest an arsonist and
it feels like the beginning of a trend
you saw there was a uh there was a man
who got arrested
i don't know the details but he had gone
inside his house he was surrounded by
black lives matter and they arrested him
i don't know the details of that yet
but what you're going to see is that the
suburban americans
are armed to the teeth they are really
armed
was it lancaster pennsylvania where the
last
bunch of riots were and i read that the
judge just totally threw the book at the
riders who got arrested so there's a
judge in pennsylvania who's just putting
the hammer down
on the rioters have you seen that before
i think it's the first time i've seen
the judge just come down with full force
and say we're gonna we're gonna put the
hammer down on these people
at the same time another judge elsewhere
has decided um i guess there's to be
arrests not a judge but apparently there
have been arrests
of the black lives matter protesters who
disturbed and
and threw over tables or whatever they
were doing in restaurants
so these are the ones who didn't hurt
anybody but they came in and they messed
up the restaurants and you know drank
their
beverages and stuff like that and
they're actually gonna they're arrested
did you think that they would be
arrested i didn't
i didn't think there was any chance that
any of those people even though they
were on film
doing something that looked vaguely
illegal to me i didn't know exactly what
laws were getting broken but it looked
illegal
and they're actually getting arrested
now
i always talk about the slippery slope
not being real
it is real in the sense that things do
go too far right
but there is always a counter force that
pops up
before it goes to the point where we all
die right
and we've definitely gone too far that's
where we're at now
and you're seeing you know millions of
residents just making independent
decisions
some are judged judges some are private
citizens
some are just buying guns some people
are just fed up some people are the
police themselves
and i think you're just going to see
this collective okay that's far enough
that's far enough what do you think
about black lives
matter and their uh and their legitimate
desire
for a fairer world well i'll give you my
opinion if you had asked me
six months ago i would say well in fact
i i tried to work with black lives
matter
because i took it so seriously that i
thought well maybe i can help
i'd like to be a productive citizen if
if black lives need a little extra help
everybody's agreeing that would be a
good place to put some work i'll put
some work there
i'll put some my money there i'll put
some work there see what i can do
what do i think now after the protest
riot slash looting now i think black
lives matter is a bad organization
no better in my mind the organizers not
not the individual people
but in my mind the organizers are
effectively the same as
ku klux klan at this point in terms of
how i think of them now i'm not talking
about historic
ku klux klan which was worse but i
talked about
ku klux klan today just the way it's
currently organized
very similar to black lives matter to me
there's no difference
and keep in mind that was it only one
year ago two years ago
that i had actually volunteered to help
them
i had volunteered to help and a year
from now i equate them with the kkk
i don't see a significant difference in
terms of
how bad it is which is different from
the
members who are legitimately protesting
about
racial equality lots of people have good
intentions but in terms of the
organization
effectively the kkk for all practical
purposes now i don't mean that they're
the same i mean they're
they're equally uh a bad influence in
the public
all right um and it could have been good
it's too bad
um here's something i borrowed from the
panda tribune
that that being a twitter account that
i follow the panda tribune and i
stole this idea and reworded it but
i asked this question if you teach
people critical
race theory before you teach them
critical reasoning
what is the predictable outcome think
about it
critical race theory is kind of
complicated in a way
you know you can't really explain it in
a sentence takes a little work
to get what the whole idea is so what
happens if you teach people that
but you have not given them the let's
say prerequisite course
of how to compare things and how to
think well
what is the obvious thing that that
would lead to
what you see that you had to get here
you could have predicted easily we're
going to teach you this
but we're not going to teach you how to
think about things productively and
compare things right
for example if black lives matter knew
how to compare things right
they would say okay let's see people
stop
by police and we're only going to look
at people who have been stopped by
police
how does that go and then you look at
the statistics and then you say
okay we'll take it a little bit deeper
how about people who were stopped by
police
and actively resisted arrest how many of
them
were white how many were black and then
you go a little deeper
and you say how many of the police
officers themselves were black
because that matters too right that
matters
so if the people learning
critical race theory had first learned
how to analyze things just the basics of
how to compare things
they would have been prepared to listen
to critical race theory
and i think their conclusion would have
been something like this
yes there's some ripple effect from
slavery
there's there are other issues or yes
there is systemic racism it's real
but what do you do about it if you don't
have
critical thinking you say to yourself it
looks like
white people cross caused this problem
historically
and therefore white people must fix it
that's because you skipped critical
thinking critical thinking doesn't say
that
critical thinking does not say
somebody who looked like you and had
your dna and had your family connection
caused the problem therefore you have to
fix it there's no logical
connection to that the logical way would
be
we have this set of problems we can
identify where the source is
but what's the best solution and the
best solution would be something like
strategy something like learning not to
resist beliefs something like better
education
something like getting rid of the police
i'm sorry that getting rid of the
teachers unions maybe there's something
about
you know better better police practices
as well that's what it would look like
it wouldn't look like what we see now
what you see now
is people who skipped the prerequisite
course for critical race theory
and um i remember i taught you that
i taught you that you can't often
persuade against the bad idea when
somebody gets a bad idea in their head
it's it's just stuck it's hard to change
anybody's idea on anything so if people
have the critical race theory stuck in
their head
erasing it or changing your mind almost
impossible
but what if you agreed and amplified
i teach you this trick before so what if
you agreed
as i just did the the that the
the conceptual stuff is actually pretty
good to know
i think it would be useful for anybody
to have that as a background in an
education to inform their current
choices
uh to the extent that it makes any
difference
but suppose you said critical race
theory is great
and here's how to make it even better
all right
we don't want to waste it because it's
so valuable
so instead of saying it's the worst
thing in the world
you go the other direction and say let's
let's really beef this up
but obviously you need a prerequisite
course
prerequisite course is how to compare
things once you're ready with that
and you've learned a little bit about
strategy and life strategy maybe
then you have a good base to take this
incredibly important concept of critical
race theory
but you're ready you know how to handle
it in its proper context
so you could agree and amplify to the
point
where you would make it a positive in
theory obviously all this stuff is
deeply difficult all right
um i think the the psychology that's
happening
to the country because of the middle
east
is bigger than you think
because i've said this before that um
and i i think this will be my favorite
thing to say
that president trump is bad at easy
stuff
and by easy stuff i mean anything that
joe biden says in public
is easy stuff right joe biden just says
what is the thing i'm supposed to say
okay can you write that on the
teleprompter for me so i can read it
all right uh and i'll read it that's
easy stuff
everybody can read the thing you're
supposed to say
president trump either he chooses not to
or he's not good at it but it ends up
looking the same
he just doesn't do easy stuff he's just
not not
good at it or he doesn't care or
something
but the net result is that he's not good
at easy stuff
but man is he good at impossible stuff
the impossible stuff
i mean literally things that people said
well that can't be done
you can't do all that stuff in the
middle east and expect to get a good out
come what's happening i don't understand
what's happening
you did everything wrong according to me
me being somebody else how can you get
such a good result
and if you do the impossible
often enough what does it do to people's
minds
i got i got one word for you
america america
what the most defining characteristic of
the founding of this country
give me one word give me one word that
describes
the american revolution better than any
other word
you ready that one word that explains
the american
birth the most critical thing that
happened to
our future in america the revolution
george washington
one word impossible
impossible we the
the founders of this country set out to
defeat
the biggest military power of its day
and then did then they did
and not only did they beat the most
impressive military power of its day
but then they built this document
that would last hundreds of years and
you know keep us on the right path
and also make the united states not just
pretty good but the most dominant
country in civilization china's doing
pretty well too but you know what i mean
and that's i've always thought that that
bit of
starting from the impossible
permeates everything about the way you
think
when steve jobs do you know the story of
steve jobs he was a teenager
and he wanted to build a computer and he
called
was it hewlett or packard i can't
remember one of the hewlett-packard guys
just called a billionaire at home he's a
teenager
steve jobs is a teenager he calls a
billionaire a home
says i want to build a computer but i
need some parts that you might have can
you give me some parts
and he did he gave him some parts
and then wozniak and jobs built a
computer
now if if anybody had asked you was that
possible
well in the sense that anything's
possible but kind of looked impossible
how about the wright brothers how about
going to the moon
how about elon musk building first the
tesla
car and then you know getting ready to
to go to mars
it's all impossible one of the things
that america has
as it's just core dna is that
is that impossible okay watch this
hold my beer hold my beer should be the
national
it should be the national slogan right
because america does impossible things
three times before lunch it's kind of
really built into who we are
that you tell me i can't do that i'm
really interested now
all right so when you watch the
president of the united states
the person who is according to all the
smart people
couldn't possibly do this thing whatever
the thing is and
that you're talking about at the moment
and then you watch him do it
first getting elected that was kind of
impossible wasn't it just getting
elected for trump seemed pretty
impossible
did that how about shaking hands with
kim jong-un
and basically defusing that whole
situation did that seem possible
hold my beer and when you watch the
middle east
coming together in a in a big way
and you watch even let's say
the decoupling from china which is on
the way by the way we are literally
decoupling from china
one of the best economic things that
could ever happen to this country
it's a whole bunch of impossibles it's
just one impossible thing after another
and the more you watch trump
and and yeah i hate to um
it's hard to not say jared kushner in
the same sentence
because you know this is a team effort
and so kushner needs to get
you know a plus plus plus on this as
well as his staff
and you watch him do the impossible
and what does it do to your mind you're
an entrepreneur
and you're thinking i couldn't do that
before that's impossible and then you
watch people do impossible stuff all day
long
on tv the president in particular
it changes you so that's the big
question the
the big the big change is how we're
thinking about everything
um why is
antifa never been reframed
uh there's something missing here you
know
if you're talking about uh abortion
you've got the people who say
it's uh it's a question of choice
and then the other side says it's a
question of life so both sides have
framed it in the best possible way for
their argument
but with antifa they've gotten away with
where anti-fascist
therefore if you're against us you're a
fascist and they get away with that
why has nobody been able to reframe
antifa is it the fact
that the formulation of anti-fascist is
just
really good in terms of powerful you
know word combinations
and that there's just no way to get in
there and reframe that thing
i don't know um so my
my suggestion had been to reframe it as
anti-capitalist
because there are very few people in
this country who are legitimately
anti-capitalism
and the fascism the way it's used is
capitalism
because they would not be happy with
bernie either
an interesting little side note kanye is
getting really
active on twitter today and he's
complaining about all the
big music industry and entertainment
industry contracts
but i think he's extended it to
contracts in general
and the point about how they're written
in legalese
so you don't know exactly what you're
getting and it's very unfair for the
artists
because they're the least capable of
knowing what they signed
an artist is not a lawyer so if they
work with lawyers against lawyers they
don't really know what they've signed
and you know i've got lots of experience
with contracts
both in my corporate world that's what i
did for a living for a while
and in my dilbert life which is just
nothing but contracts all day long
contracts and contracts so i'm you
fairly
fairly experienced at doing that stuff
but kanye's point
i am so in favor of to the point where i
thought that one of the things we should
do in this country is create
i say this a million times create brand
new
towns and cities from scratch where we
just say all right
throw out all the rules if you're going
to build a city from scratch
knowing what we do what we know today
what would you do right and what would
you do wrong
for example i would say that you can't
have
legalese in this town you can have
contracts
but they have to be written in english
by the way
in my early corporate days i'd often get
contracts from my lawyer who would you
know some response to
something else that we had to do and i
would take my lawyers
legalese and i would just rewrite it
into uh
three paragraphs in english and then i
would give it back to my lawyer and say
okay this is what it would look like if
you wrote it in real people language
is there anything wrong with us and my
lawyer would look at it and go
nope nope there's nothing wrong with it
you can actually rewrite what i wrote in
english language so that other people
would know exactly what you mean and
nobody will be confused
and there was no problem at all it's
just that if you're a lawyer you don't
do it
because you need to keep up appearances
you want to make sure you've covered a
hundred percent of your risk whereas
you know maybe i got 99.
so i would see it i would see a town
that has no legalese
i would want the insurance to be the
government
there would be no insurance of any kind
for your car your health insurance
your house or anything except the
government
and the profit from that would be your
taxes
so you wouldn't pay taxes you would just
buy insurance
buy insurance for your car buy insurance
for health care you just buy insurance
and the profit from that would replace
taxes
i would also get rid of money
so that you only have crypto and nobody
has to touch anything
and you don't need a bank so i'd get rid
of banks
money lawyers with legalese maybe you
need
the lawyers still but i get rid of the
legalese i get rid of insurance except
by the government
and do a lot of other things that's just
a start
so when you see kanye talking about this
you might think this is a small deal
that's a small deal talking about
lawyers having complicated language
isn't that like the smallest deal you
could work on
nope because that language is a
confusopoly it's
designed to make you not know what
you're signing it's a big problem
i am so with kanye on this and he has
definitely
identified a genuine problem of major
magnitude to a lot of people
so good luck on good luck kanye on that
i've noticed that there's a type of
person i debate with
online recently there was this guy with
hashtag blm
and hashtag acab meaning all cops are
bastards
in his profile so i knew what i was
getting
but he started out with his list of
hoaxes
criticizing the president oh you did
this he did this
and one by one i gave him sources and
and debunked all of his hoaxes
once he had learned that his world view
was complete garbage
that the most important things he
thought about politics in the world and
trump
were just hoaxes you know and you can
look at the
sources to see did he then
change his mind of course not he went
after me personally
now it's one thing that somebody comes
and they insult the messenger i'm used
to that
but he decided it was going to be his
full-time job and he would just keep
coming back and pestering me personally
having nothing to do with politics
until ultimately i blocked them but i'm
thinking
how sick do you have to be to start with
a world view
somebody debunks your world view and
then instead of saying man
i guess i got to work on my world view a
little bit i think i'm gonna have to
you know look into understanding things
better but instead
you go on a personal attack against the
person who clarified your worldview
that is sick that's some sick stuff
there's a there's a video of
bob de niro just going through his rants
about president trump
and you can't watch that without
thinking i think the line between
political disagreement and mental
health has been crossed that just looks
like mental health it doesn't
and and i don't want to treat it like
it's something else
because the moment you try to treat it
with respect and say oh no
you know maybe if i give you some more
information
you'll change your mind that's not
what's happening with robert de niro
now again i'm not a doctor and you're
not supposed to diagnose
people from a distance but uh
hold my beer because i'm gonna i'm gonna
do that he's clearly
not well all right um
i think that one of the reasons that the
woodward book
is not having much of an impact i think
we've reached the
turning point in people's understanding
of the world
you know the majority of them anyway
where they understand that
there's no such thing as a non-fiction
book
about a person if you write a
non-fiction book of lsa
math that's probably just fine but if
you write a
quote non-fiction book about a real
person
living or dead that's not nonfiction
that is fiction because of the way the
data is organized because the author can
reorganize the data
leave things down put things in you know
put things next to each other
until he's he or she has designed a
whole
narrative and story that narrative and
story is fiction
because it had to be created by
arranging things
if you didn't create it by arranging the
order of
so-called facts it wouldn't be fiction
but it is always arranged so i think the
public
now looks at the woodwork book and says
okay that's some creative fiction there
and they just move on it feels like
we're getting to that point
all right netflix
has a new content down there called the
devil all the time
i don't know what it's about but i do
know that three things that they have
promoted the most recently are something
called the devil all the time
a tv show that's very popular on netflix
called
lucifer and um something that
reasonable people are calling pedophilia
you know that cuties movie
so that's the three things that are
highlighted in the
era of obama obama
having a big connection with netflix
are these all coincidences
probably probably they're probably just
coincidences
because that's how it works but there's
a lot of them
just saying all right um
what do you think of the idea of
coddling dictators
today you know i feel like
the whole uh president trump coddles
dictators
that idea is going to take a big hit
because obviously as i just mentioned
coddling dictators is probably what's
going to get us a major
outcome good outcome in the middle east
coddling president xi and china
probably allows us to be much tougher on
china
and ultimately decouple without making
it personal
and you don't want to make it personal
because that's a problem
coddling dictators probably is why north
korea
hasn't been much of a risk since you
know about the time that they shook
hands
coddling dictators may have helped with
putin and isis it may have
i don't know but it seems to be that
this idea of
coddling dictators is so childlike
simplistic that maybe people are
understanding the adult version of that
the adult version of coddling dictators
is
that you treat everybody with respect
but you still go hard
and by the way the president says that
directly
you know in his own words but he's not
mincing any words
he's saying i'm absolutely going to
teach treat all of them with respect
and i'm going to push hard he says it
often
and then we watch him do it yep he
treated him with respect
yup he pushed hard and something good
came out of it
so i think the whole idea of coddling
dictators
has to be brought up to the the adult
table
there's a story about this wuhan uh oh
no not a wuhan but there's a story about
a dr
lee mingan who whose claim is that the
the chinese communist party created
the wuhan china virus coronavirus
and that they released it on purpose
so she's been on talker i guess she was
on talker's show last night
and what do you think of that do you
think that's
true i believe she got uh knocked off a
twitter
for these claims i need a fact check on
that but it looks like she got
kicked off at least some social media
maybe more social medias
do you believe it
i'm going to say no i'm going to say no
on this not because it's not
true i'm going to say that i don't
believe it
which doesn't mean it's not true it just
means that the credibility
there's something about this story that
just doesn't smell right
just doesn't smell right now
if it turns out that it's true i don't
know if we'll ever know for sure
but if we do find out then i'll say okay
well i guess i was surprised but and
and if i tried to tell you what it is
about this
that's bothering me i don't exactly know
you know sometimes you can smell
something before you see it
there's just something about this that's
not quite smelling right
that's all i'll say could be true
all right um president trump
i didn't see it but i saw the story
about it apparently trump
retweeted some kind of a meme or other
tweet
that accused directly or indirectly
joe biden of being a pedophile and
the the oh my god pearl clutching
part of the public said oh no that is
over the line
that's way over the line calling your
your opponent a pedophile or even just
tweeting something that did
way over the line that is so far of the
line to which i say
nope no no the president trump
didn't he didn't make the rules he
didn't make the rules
the lines that he's playing in were made
by somebody else and he's well within
the lines
the fine people hoax is worse than any
lie that we've ever seen especially one
that's so easily debunked you just have
to read the transcript to know it's
taken out of context there's nothing
worse
than the fine people hoax and i've said
that i think it's a big part of the
the violence and protests certainly has
killed people
i would say that the fine people hoax
you can't
you can't identify specific people were
killed but i think it's fair to say
people died
because of that because of the the
feelings that it made
so i don't think that it is out of those
bounds which are ridiculous boundaries
we should not have those boundaries
in fact the fine people oaks should
definitely go away
and the boundaries of what is fair game
for politics
should be a lot smaller that's my first
choice
but if we're not going to shrink the
field
and that's in bounds if the fine people
hoaxes and bounds
an accusation of pedophilia against a
person running for president
completely in bounds completely
do i think it's true no
do i think it's nice
no do i think it informs the public well
no do i think maybe it would be better
if it hadn't happened
maybe do i think you know you should be
proud of it
no no but
calling it out of bounds that is
objectively just not true
and i would say that the president
doesn't need to
he doesn't hold back any weapons he
doesn't need to hold back any weapons
once the other side has determined what
the playing area is
once they've decided this is the playing
area he's allowed to play there
and he did so maybe they don't like it
so much now
and i gotta admit i'm kind of enjoying
the president literally just making up
stuff
and accusing biden of it because that's
what's happening the other way
so if he hadn't been doing this
literally just making stuff up
that he wouldn't be fighting his heart
uh
so there's that uh and then also the
president
uh retweeted uh a doctored video
that he doesn't mention his doctorate in
which biden was giving a speech and he
wanted to play the song
despacito from his phone so he
turns it on and he places into the
microphone despacito
well somebody cleverly switched the song
into some anti-cop song
so you see biden's singing along and
looking all happy
while apparently an anti-cop song with
some bad words in it
is coming out and the president tweeted
it
twice he tweeted it once last night
and then he got up in the morning and
tweeted it again
now i don't know maybe the president
knows it's real maybe he doesn't know
it's real
that video but uh it's fair
it's fair again as long as the fine
people hoax is out there
as long as the you know the drinking
bleach hoax is out there
he can do anything he wants it's all
fair
he can literally just make stuff up as
he is totally fair here's a uh
innovation that might be cool um some
scientists engineers whatever
researchers
found out that you can cool your house
more effectively by cooling the walls
instead of the people in other words
they have
walls they have some water running
through them in pipes or something
and if you can cool the wall then
the thermal radiation coming off your
body will you know
basically get sucked toward the place
where there's less energy
and it actually gives you the feeling of
being cooled off and it's 50 percent
cheaper than regular
ac when i've told you that we shouldn't
worry so much about the ultimate outcome
of
climate change because we'll we'll
develop lots of new tools that we don't
know about
here's one now i don't know if this is
practical because how practical is it to
make a wall that's got water in it
i've got a feeling this isn't quite as
practical as they want it to be
but there might be a way to get there
there might be a way to get there
some of you are taking off i see all
right
so think about that um here are some
things that democrats have learned
recently they learned that russia
collusion was fake
and that their side could put that on
they realized that
north korea probably wasn't a fluke that
something good happened there
because the middle east looks good if
if north korea had been the only thing
that happened you might say well that
was a fluke he just got lucky with that
but now you've got serbia kosovo bahrain
you know uae it's not going to look like
a coincidence
pretty soon um was it only two weeks ago
that everybody on the left
who was smart was saying mail and votes
are totally
safe yeah there's nothing wrong with
mailing in votes that can never go wrong
it's been tested in these other states
and then
as i told you yesterday that even the
cnn ran a major story saying that
mail-in voting is a nightmare and
undependable that's cnn
so what happened to all those people who
had believed
their news sources the mail-in voting is
totally dependable
and now their own news sources have
completely reversed and said
no actually it's really really risky
do people say oh i guess i was fooled
how about the idea of uh
you know these riots i think the riots
are wearing people down
and the riots have went from hey this is
maybe good for society too this is just
nothing but bad
and black lives matter or marxists it
feels to me
that a lot of the biggest things that
democrats believed
are just evaporating now i've done a ton
of work as you know
trying to get rid of the fine people
hoax and the bleach drinking hoax
and i feel like it's starting to make a
little difference
how long has it been since biden
mentioned the find people hoax
or the drinking bleach hoax
i'd love to get a uh i'd love to get a
read on that
to see if he stopped doing that i don't
know if he did
uh yeah and then people are also
learning that the forest fires
are because of bad management they're
also learning that
green new deal doesn't work because in
california we couldn't even keep the
lights on because we
got rid of nuclear and also gas
and it feels to me like
it's just one big thing after another
there was something they believed on the
left
that has unambiguously been proven not
true even to their satisfaction
it'd be one thing to prove to the right
that people on the left were wrong about
something that's just ordinary
but i think the people on the left are
seeing it one after another
just one thing after another that they
believed to be true
they're completely untrue
um all right
yeah somebody says in the comments that
we have uh blm
fatigue i think that's true
somebody says they just found 1600 votes
bail in votes in new jersey
yeah i think you're going to see more
and more stories especially as we get
closer to the election
of mail-in voting irregularities it's
just going to be one thing after another
but the thing that's really the kicker
is cnn reported this this is right off
of cnn
that black and minority voters will have
the most
ballots rejected now i'm assuming that
has something to do with income level
which has something to do with education
level
which probably is related to how well
you can fill in a form correctly
so it has nothing to do with black per
se it's probably just a low income thing
but it's going to hit some groups harder
how does cnn
deal with the fact that they've reported
that their preferred method is racist
that's their own reporting
what do they do with that
all right and i think watching all the
cops resign
and watching the murder rate zoom and
watching
basically everything that the protesters
said
follow the garbage turn out to be wrong
oh here's the other thing think about
how big a deal it is
that the schools went from you know it's
going to be really hard to have any kind
of school choice
to because of coronavirus i think it's
just going to happen
there are a whole bunch of good things
that came out of this coronavirus
at the cost the tremendous cost of life
but you know every war does this you
know world war ii produced a whole bunch
of
domestic benefits nobody would have
wanted world war
ii just to get those benefits but it
happens
it's a it's a fairly predictable outcome
one of the other outcomes i think
is that future pandemics will be much
less risk
do you think that's true don't you think
that this experience
will teach us how to be ready for the
next one and maybe even be able to have
a vaccine and
it wouldn't surprise me if the next time
we have a vaccine in two months
right maybe good or a
therapeutic in a few months so now we're
seeing the news trickling out of
therapeutics that seem to have a big
impact i think by the end of the year
well let me put it this way on january
1st
2021 i plan to party like it's 2021.
2021 is going to be lit
because our forest fires are going to be
over at least for the winter
our coronavirus will be much diminished
if not
solved by then our economy will be
roaring back and we will have learned
a lot we're going to have telehealth
we're going to have school choice
we're going to have delivery of
everything we
we did hasten the end of retail in a lot
of places but maybe that needed to
happen anyway because amazon was going
to get there eventually
to put them out of business there's a
lot
happening we just went through the worst
third act
you've well of my life i would say this
is the worst
third act of my life
but i think i think we made it
do you remember take yourself back to
the spring in the spring when i was
doing
two periscopes a day to try to keep
people from jumping off a ledge
how many of you were sure that we would
make it
meaning that the country would just
survive and that we would all survive
it was dicey wasn't it looked a little
dicey
and i told you no we're going to be fine
you know people will die that's couldn't
avoid it unfortunately
but we are going to pull out of this and
when we do we're going to be stronger
and that's what's happening so you're
seeing it now this is the turn
there is something in the air right now
and i think the middle east
peace stuff was the was the big
maybe trigger that just starts bringing
all the other stuff together
things are going our way these these
days things
are going our way so we'll try to take
care of the people who need
extra help because they're going to be a
lot of them do not forget
the people who are in the most the
biggest whole and then the biggest
situation but man
as of today things are going the right
direction
finally finally so
let's end on that good note and i will
talk to you
later
