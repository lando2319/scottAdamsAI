well i have a tree for you because i
know you woke up this morning and you
said to yourself this will be an
ordinary day and then you locked or
perhaps it was skill and came upon this
live stream
which will change
many of your lives
now if you wait to the end i'm going to
give you a micro lesson two of them
actually
that are designed for high impact in the
shortest amount of time
to actually reprogram some of you from
your sadness and or ptsd
into a happier version of yourself and i
can do it in about four minutes
two minutes a piece
uh that'll be on the whiteboard and
that'll that'll come so that's just a
teaser to make you stay normally i put
these behind a paywall
but my local subscribers have agreed
with me
that these would be
important enough or at least they agreed
with my judgment that it would be
important enough
to share them with the wider audience
and so
that's coming
now
if you'd like to
extend your experience
into another realm almost unimaginable
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
up tanker jealous or stein a canteen jug
or flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine the end of the day
yeah it's the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and dog got it it's good it's happening
right now go
if any of you have ever tried this with
a placebo sip
where there's no actual beverage in your
cup
it was better than no sip
probably
but next time
improve your game make sure there's a
beverage in there
that's all i'm saying i'm not gonna name
names
well uh
trump has uh said quote the new york
times just admitted and
participated in an effort to rig the
election for joe biden
now there's a statement
that not long ago
would have been considered
unfounded
it might have been considered
hyperbolic
fact checkers
would have said it wasn't true
what'd they say about it today
well if they have a dictionary
and they believe they're reporting in
the new york times
they say well that's true
i doubt they actually say it just like
that
but
the new york times reporting does
fit the the actual dictionary definition
of something that's rigged
for a specific purpose it looks like it
now the part we don't know
is intention
am i right
i mean we can't read the minds of the
new york times could they have been
legitimately fooled
but then later came out of their fog
could be
could be you can't rule out that people
are legitimately brainwashed and then
climb out of it after time could happen
but
uh
let's give this the really test shall we
if you're new to this the really test is
you just use the word really in a
sarcastic way after saying the statement
that you're testing
and just see if it works okay
i'll try it
so the new york times wasn't trying to
influence the election
despite their close
uh ties to uh democrats and the history
of
slanting their coverage for political
purposes
but
even though it would have been a very
clever way
to rig an election and even though it
worked perfectly
exactly as one imagined it would be and
even though
all the people who would love to have
seen the new york times do such a thing
which allegedly they did but we have no
evidence of
is it possible that the new york times
did not succumb to all the pressures
political
financial and otherwise that was put
upon them and act exactly as they have
in the past in a fashion we should uh
expect and predict
no they were just fooled and then they
came out of it
really
really
they were just fooled
by their own reporting
so they brainwashed themselves
but then they un-brainwashed themselves
out later and didn't believe that in her
own reporting
or the 50 intel officials
former officials who said that the
laptop was russian disinformation but it
turns out it was a real laptop
yeah this one doesn't really pass the
really test does it meaning that
trump's assumption that all of this was
intentional
you can't prove it
probably unless there's some kind of
written record somewhere
but
it sure looks like it
let's just say that
all right here's another little test for
uh truth that i like to call the
elephant in the room test
and the elephant in the room test as
i've described before and then i'm gonna
apply it to a new situation
is
that if there are two people in a room
and one of them says hey there's an
elephant in this room with us let's say
there's no furniture there's nothing
else it's just a bear room
two people in it
one of them says
do you see this elephant that's standing
right here in front of us
and the other person in the room says um
nope i do not see an elephant
and then the first one says uh
we're in a small room just the two of us
and an elephant
surely you see the elephant
and then the other one says i honestly
do not see an elephant
which one of them is hallucinating
the one who sees it
is the one who's hallucinating maybe not
100 of the time but as a rule of thumb
it's really really reliable
that hallucinations are additions to
scenery not subtractions
people don't hallucinate not seeing
something
do you understand that you you don't you
don't nobody walks into a room full of
furniture
and hallucinates that it's an empty room
i mean maybe in the history of the world
somebody has but that's not a common
thing
but we've seen with all the fake news
that people believe about just about
anything
they're adding scenery you know adding
an elephant to a room
fifty percent of the public will believe
any elephant in any room and they'll say
they see it
so adding something to a scene is almost
always the hallucination not the one who
doesn't see it
now
is the is the filter understood
because now i'm going to apply it
and remember
that when i apply it i'm i'm also where
it doesn't work every time
can can you accept
the humility i'm trying to inject here
that i'm not saying that this is some
kind of 100 thing but it's pretty darn
reliable
and you're not going to like it
can i prime you by saying you're not
going to like what i say next
you're going to hate it
most of you
it goes like this
we're seeing some
some people talking about the data about
the vaccinations and that the
vaccination itself they claim
uh can be shown by
various data
to be
more dangerous than any officials have
admitted
now would you say first of all that that
is happening
that um there are people who are saying
the vares database
is telling you something others say it's
not
um so you would agree that that's
happening that that difference in
opinion
there are those who say the excess
mortality numbers there was a gentleman
on
the
war room recently who looked at the
millennials
excess death rate and
his claim is that
using public information
you can see that there's just a huge
spike
at about the time the vaccinations were
rolling out apparently so his hypothesis
is that it is clear
from excess death
that the vaccinations
themselves have some mortality element
that has never has not been fully
disclosed to the public
now
so so so far i'm just telling you what
other people have said so we're not
talking about what's true yet
just the claims
now um also other people have said
they've looked at i think the pfizer
data
and said that they found stuff in there
that they believe
also suggests that the vaccinations
are more dangerous than has been claimed
so so the context here
is that there are multiple sources of
data
that would seem to suggest
and i'll use suggest
that the vaccination themselves would
have more deen had more danger
than has been disclosed to the public
does everybody agree with the context so
far
i think you're okay with that right
now here's where the elephant test comes
in
and again remember the elephant test
isn't 100 accurate
it's just really really good rule of
thumb
so everybody in the world who knows
about data and virology and vaccinations
basically anybody who has an interest in
it is looking at all of this data
wouldn't you agree
there are lots of people looking at the
same data
would you also agree
that with so many people
with such a great interest i mean the
greatest possible news worthiness you
could have that there are lots of people
who are looking at the same data and
saying
i don't see it
now i'm not saying it's not there
the claim is very narrow that i'm making
that there are lots of experts who are
capable i'm not i'm not capable of
looking at the data but there are lots
of experts who are capable of looking at
it
some of them see the elephant
and some do not
so far i've not made a judgment
would you say that the setup is correct
the experts are looking at multiple data
data sources
some are saying i see all this danger
and it's very clear and some are looking
at the same data at the same time
and saying i don't see it
correct or not correct
now
can i independently do a deep dive
with all of my expertise
and figure out which of these two groups
is right
well
if those two groups can't do it why
could i do it
why would there be people disagreeing
who actually have all the expertise in
these areas if they are just if those
two groups are disagreeing how the hell
am i with my complete lack of knowledge
going to do a deep dive and figure out
who's right
i mean that's not really a thing
so all we can do is look at
the people who are looking at it we
can't look at the data really if you're
if you're being honest about it
you can't really tell by the data
but are the people credible
do you believe the person who sees the
elephant or the person who's standing
right next to him in the room
looking at the same room and they don't
see it and there are lots of them
in this case it's not one person who
doesn't see the elephant
it's lots of them
now of course people are saying follow
the money and their other incentives etc
that's fair
but there are so many people with an
interest who don't have a financial
incentive
they would see it too
and i don't think it's happening
all right
so keep in mind
somebody says it's a bad analogy um all
analogies are bad the only thing i'm
saying is that uh i use the analogy to
uh make a general point so if you don't
like if you don't like the analogy
you don't need it just take the general
point
the general point is that hallucinations
are almost always
additions to the scenery
they're rarely a subtraction
one once you notice that
it becomes a lot easier to untangle
what's real and what's not
right
that's why i don't believe in ufos by
the way
ufos are in addition to the scenery
that you would expect a lot more people
would have seen and gotten some good
pictures
[Laughter]
by now
but you know i don't believe additions
to the scenery basically
there's a big story about putin's palace
now of course
this fits perfectly into what you would
expect
for wartime propaganda
so can we believe that this story is
true
because it was in the media
no
but even the media suggests
that they can't confirm
that it's putin's palace
but allegedly there's this i don't know
190 000 square foot gigantic palace of
the black sea
that putin allegedly forced the
oligarchs to buy for him and includes an
underground hockey rink and
all that
um everything you would imagine in the
modern palace
um
but
officially russia says that putin lives
in an 800 square foot apartment
which is
an 800 square foot apartment i wonder if
there's anybody in russia who believes
that
probably right probably 25 of the people
in russia because you know 25 is the
number i always jokingly say will
believe anything
probably 25 percent of the people in
russia are like wow
that putin sure lives an austere life we
think he only owns one suit
because he seems to wear the same suit
all the time so he probably owns one
suit and an 800 square foot apartment
so but maybe not the other possibility
is that he's the richest human who has
ever existed in the history of the
universe
or he lives in an 800 square foot
apartment on 140 000 a year it's one of
those two things
um i always laughed at the warren
buffett myth
so warren buffett you know one at one
point i guess he was richest man in
america but he's still up there uh
warren buffett has always been
reported to have lived in his basically
the same
relatively modest home
that he had always lived in
and uh i believe there's you know he's
added to his modest home so there's like
a
super structure behind the
modest structure so this is a little bit
bigger than it looks but
does that mean anything if you're warren
buffett
how often is warren buffett not in uh
the
the presidential suite of whatever
high-end hotel he's at
does warren buffett like
spend much time at home
i feel like it's where he goes on
holidays
and you know to visit his wife and
whatnot but i don't think it would be
accurate to say that one of the richest
people in the world
you know lives in that little home
that he visits often he does people have
reported that he does in fact
stay there so that that's a confirmed
fact
uh but
how many days a year
does he not stay at somebody's mansion
or
you
know or uh at the best facility the
humans have ever
created
anyway
um
your challenge today is twofold
it's a two-part challenge is everybody
up for it number one
uh i'd like you all to mock me for my
lack of military expertise you may do
this now
please begin
uh begin the mocking you've heard me say
many things about the ukraine situation
and i welcome you now to mock me for uh
and accurately quite accurately mock me
for my complete and total
ignorance of all things military
go
good good general dummy
nice
general adams not mocking enough
um
yes general adams i think general adams
is a good
good general satirical direction you
don't know schiff good it's a callback i
like the callback
um
you've never even been in a fight scott
good
go after my cowardice i think that's a
good
vain to mine productive
private scott
i'm not a general now
wimp major dunce
um
major misunderstanding
not bad
a plus
my new nickname is major
misunderstanding or general atoms all
right so you're doing a good job of this
major clot
another call back i like that the
callbacks are all appreciated
all right you're doing a very good job
of mocking me for my lack of military
expertise now let's move on to
um the second part of the challenge
remember this is a twofold challenge and
i must say i must compliment you
your mocking of my lack of military
expertise is excellent
gomer adams nice
gomer adams i like that one
major malfunction general disarray
private pekka
what
uh pointy hair general
pointy hair general that's
i i'm gonna give that uh top shelf
uh lieutenant
rear admiral come on don't
don't be uh
don't do that
um atoms do little
all right so here's the second part of
your challenge now that you have
successfully mocked me from my lack of
military expertise part two
uh explain why i'm the only person who
predicted russia couldn't defeat ukraine
in two days because the defenders would
have access to high tank tank killing
weapons
okay that took all the fun out of it
i'm just saying
that sometimes
you don't need to be an expert
to see things that are just sort of
glaringly obvious
now the the assumption that i made is
that they would have access
to enough
and that part maybe i got lucky on i'll
admit
because i didn't know how much they had
i knew they had access to the good stuff
whatever the good stuff was
uh because they had such good friends
friends meaning nato in the united
states when you've got friends like nato
you probably
and especially if if russia is involved
you probably have access to good weapons
and i had speculated that since nobody
had ever seen
a high
quantity of the best kind of weapons
against tanks
that common sense sort of says that even
if they had air cover and coordinated
artillery even if they did everything
right
it seemed to me that if you had enough
drones and and uh
and shoulder mounted stuff
the defenders would still have the
advantage
now
i don't know
was that just a lucky guess based on my
ignorance cancelling out my other
ignorance it could have been
to be honest it could have been
but you do have to ask yourself why all
the experts were wrong and the person
that you just mocked for incorrectly
correctly mocked for my lack of military
understanding
got it right with reasons
i mean i showed my work
i said here's the reason
advanced military equipment that will
surprise you how effective it is
i said it directly
now i also got completely wrong
that putin would actually attack i said
it was a bluff
and my reasoning for the bluff
was that
it seemed obvious it couldn't work
and i think i was half right
it's obvious i mean to me it looked
obvious that it couldn't work
so i thought it must be obvious to putin
and that's where apparently i'm
completely wrong now i could also be
completely wrong still
if putin ends up prevailing
at the moment
the the experts
that i'm seeing at least quoted in the
news lately
and do a fact check on me
is this correct
that the military experts are now saying
that
putin does not have
a sufficient source uh force
to take and hold kiev
that's true right
and that therefore they won't actually
conquer the government
so
can you fact check that the
i haven't seen every military opinion
but i think
i think the military is now saying they
could destroy the city but they can't
really take it and hold it because they
don't even have the right kind of forces
to do that
not even close
like a they have maybe twenty percent of
what they need something like that
um yeah what are they actually holding
that was a good question
all right um
so
here's a uh
interesting thing that happened
i think i'm all over the place in my
order of things
um
i saw a tweet by nazir uh afzal he's a
prosecutor among other things
and he said this he said are you
surprised that in the matter of jeffrey
epstein and hundreds of high-profile men
sexually abusing hundreds of young girls
and
children the only person convicted is a
woman
now of course that means only on top of
jeffrey epstein himself that i assume
that's implied
but
just think about that
it's basically
a crime committed allegedly by hundreds
of men
and so far the only person convicted was
was the only woman who wasn't
the only person who wasn't epstein
epstein
was a woman
now she was guilty as hell so you know
it makes sense that she'd be the
the first person to be convicted who
isn't him
but i don't think we're going to see any
other convictions do you
it looks like this has been successfully
just taken away from the public's right
to have any justice or knowledge about
it
um
why are we okay with this
there's literally nothing you can do
about it is there
unless you wanted to make it like your
life's work to you know
start a big campaign to get everybody
interested in finding the names of these
people
but i don't know that anybody
has a much power or passion or cares
about it compared to all the other
gigantic problems in the world
and so in a sense it's sort of
lucky for the accused
that there are bigger stories at the
moment that always helps but this is
it's kind of tells us a lot that we'll
never know who is on the island besides
epstein
i mean except for the few that we've
heard about who flew in the plane but
that's all we know for sure they flew in
the plane um breaking news breaking news
and i want you to listen carefully to
this
because if you haven't heard this yet
uh this is breaking news breaking
a hundred former intel officials have
determined that you can end war in
ukraine by spanking your taint with a
wooden spoon
several anonymous sources inside the
white house have confirmed the story
and no court has ruled it false
and fact checkers and science agree
now that's a lot of credibility
i mean
i would be convinced if one former intel
official told me something
but if a hundred told me well that's
pretty believable i mean could you
imagine that like dozens of intel
officials could tell you something that
was just not true like intentionally i
can't imagine that that could never
happen could it
um so that's believable um and then
there's several anonymous sources and i
don't i don't know what's more
believable than an anonymous source i do
several
the only thing better than an anonymous
source in the white house is several
that makes it totally believable if
somebody if one person tells you that
there are several
why would you not believe that
um
and then
no court has ruled that this is false
and as we learned in the uh in the
elections as long as the court hasn't
ruled something
to be true it's not true and if they
haven't ruled it false it's not false
and if the fact checkers and the science
all agree
well we've never seen the fact checkers
be wrong and i think you'd all agree
that the science
is settled and once the science is
spoken that's all you need to know
now i'd like to explain something to the
non-native speakers
if there are some people here who are
confused
by the word taint let me give you a
history lesson
taint
is a
let's say an evolved word from the uh
the poor grammar in english that used to
be ain't
so people used to say and it's
considered poor grammar
this ain't true meaning this
is not true
it ain't
but
when people say
it
ain't
that is often shortened by
rural people in the united states
to taint
my grandmother for example
she would say dang true
it taken true
she actually did use that
so
the taint
is actually defined in modern usage
as and i have to say this carefully so
i'm not
kicked off of uh
off of any platforms
so i'm going to say this in a g-rated
way
the taint is defined as the um the part
of your body
that's between your uh genitalia
and congress
so everything that's between your
genitalia and congress
that's called the taint
because it taint your genitalia and
taint congress
it's the taint
now
um that's just for the benefit for any
anyone who is not a native american
speaker
and by the way uh if you if you want to
get that confirmed
talk to any native uh american speaker
on this live stream who can confirm it
for you
because
that's the kind of people they are they
like to help
all right um
so
let's see what else is going on we've
got
axios was accused of some fake news by
the other fake news
so the fake news said the axios had some
fake news which has been corrected to
less fake news
and the story was that
reporter zachary basu
had written a story that
that some ukrainian had asked earlier
had asked the u.s to quote go beyond
traditional military aid and provide the
country with the funding training and
weaponry to support a long-term
resistance movement
but the ukrainians say no that's not a
real letter nobody ever sent that letter
and the american
government says no nobody ever sent us
that letter so axios has updated to say
that the letter is disputed
disputed by the people who sent it and
the people who allegedly received it
allegedly all
so that's some fake news
that may have been corrected but i'll
give the axios credit when uh when the
criticisms were leveled at them they did
keep the story and they added that it's
disputed and
you know
evidence-free
you know if
uh i've often said this they they have
to judge people by how they correct
their mistakes or how they respond to
mistakes if you judge people by mistakes
then we're all
that's sort of the end of the story
there's there's no redemption
because you just can't you can't judge
people by their mistakes
if you go through life like that
you're just lost i mean civilization
won't even hold together because we're
all basically a mess and we're all we're
all messing up a lot
so it's just not a viable
way to judge people is by the mistakes
they make but a very viable way is to
judge them by how they respond
do they say oh god i'm so sorry and mean
it
and do they then tell you what they're
going to do about it
and then do they follow up and actually
do that thing that they said they would
do to not make that mistake again now if
somebody does that
i like them better than if they hadn't
made the mistake in the first place
because i can't judge but somebody for
making a mistake even bad ones really
but you could totally judge people by
how they handled it after the mistake
that's fair
because that's technique and it's
available to everybody right it's not
hard
you apologize you admit
you you make good you say what you're
going to do differently and then you
follow up on it and you do it
differently
everybody knows how to do that
so
some can do it some can't
anyway so i give axios credit for the
correction
um
apparently california is experiencing a
crime tourism
according to a kabc story
and the story here and i saw
michael shellenberger
tweet this who is running for governor
of california as an independent the only
person i've ever known
to run for office with a complete
vetted set of solutions for the exact
problems of the state
and by vetted i mean
actually researching what works and what
doesn't showing his work
stop doing the things that we know don't
work do the things that do work i mean
just basic
basic i don't know
strategic business way to approach
anything
who knows if
being non-political works
he's basically trying to win by extreme
competence
and i don't know if that's ever been
done
honestly
think about that
who's ever tried to win a major election
let's say governor senator or president
with extreme
competence
in other words just demonstrating an
ability to do a bunch of things
successfully
has anybody ever done that
you're saying trump but you know trump
would be disputed as how much is
hyperbole and how much was real
but you know if you look at
shellenberger's work
even his critics
will say this is an impressive body of
work
somebody says cory booker i don't know
too much about that um anyway crime
tourism as uh michael schellenberger
tweeted
so law enforcement agencies
have determined that there are
criminal groups from south america
that organized to come to california
to do these uh sort of organized uh
smash and runs on private high-end
residents
so they'll go to some place when you're
not home you know a rich person's house
generally and break in they don't worry
too much about alarms i don't think
because they're going to be in and out
and they i think they just go to the
bedroom mostly and look for jewelry
the the easy stuff they're not looking
for furniture and flat screens tvs
they're looking for a quick hit of
usually jewels
and um so this is the story
and i can confirm that according to my
neighbor's video
surveillance we all share our video
surveillance
i mean not electronically directly but
you know when something happens
we're very well organized in the
neighborhood so as soon as anything
happens at anybody's house everybody
everybody sees the video of it
and apparently
the south american teams have had two of
my neighbors
i'm so this is a story that actually
directly affects me literally
this is not this is not a joke
if i stood up
and my my window was open
i could throw a baseball and hit my
neighbor's house
that was robbed by one of these south
american groups
the other one i'd have to throw the ball
twice but it's in the neighborhood
twice
this is just my neighborhood
i'm talking about one block
not really the same block but
effectively
the distance of a block
now
my house
is never empty i vote somebody's always
here so usually they go for an empty
house
um
and at least i've got that going for me
but i also have the last house in the
world that you'd want to break into
you don't need to know the details
i'll just tell you that if you're
looking for a house to break into you
might want to prioritize mine last not
only because there's nothing of any
value that you could carry out
uh literally there's uh
oh this would be an interesting question
what would be the highest value thing in
my house that you could actually carry
out
and like put in a car
yeah yeah like uh
400 worth of
you know medicinal marijuana that's
about it my printer
if they steal my printer i'm in good
shape i don't even think people steal
computers anymore do they
i don't know if it's worth it
so uh anyway
crime tourism is happening
um
let's get to the good part shall we
shall we get to the good part
let me tell you the great thing about
being my age so here's the first
inspirational
thing of several to come
people who are young are scared to death
of being older
i was completely surprised at how
awesome it is in a lot of different ways
that you don't see coming you just don't
see it coming
one of the ways is
that you know how it all turned out
now that's only good if it turned out
well in some way
now when i say when it turned out well i
use the following the standard
for success
which is how many people you helped
in in a significant way
and i don't think there's any other good
standard
because money doesn't you know really
capture it um
if you know if you
had a great relationship with one person
well that's great for the two of you
but maybe if you could do something for
some other people that would be good now
one of the things that
i chose early in my career
i originally wanted to be a lawyer
in high school i thought that's where i
was going but at some point i figured
out that being a lawyer is usually a
zero-sum game
there's a winner and a loser
so society sort of breaks even
you know in a very general way
it's not a clean win it's not an
addition
elon musk is just added right he didn't
take anything from anybody he just added
stuff to the world
that's what i wanted to be i wanted to
be a person who only added and never had
to take something from anybody so i
didn't want to be in a militant kind of
a job
so i became a cartoonist and then i
write books that are designed to be
useful and then i also do these micro
lessons which are designed to be useful
now i've got over 200 micro lessons on
the locals platform that you have to
subscribe to to see
these will be public because the locals
people trust me to make a decision when
to make stuff public
and what i'm going to do is show you two
reframes
which is simply a different way of
looking at something
to help you with any kind of past trauma
or ptsd
and then any kind of feelings of despair
or sadness
two separate lessons two minutes of
peace
now the math of this goes like this
there's no reason to suspect that either
these two lessons would necessarily help
any one of you specifically
i guarantee
that some percentage of you will have
your lives changed
in the next few minutes
in less than five minutes probably
guarantee it it's a it's just a law of
large numbers and the fact that i know
they used to be useful
now secondly every one of you could
probably benefit from something on the
list of over 200 of the micro lessons
and you would respond to different ones
but the math of it is you would probably
have a life changing experience to be ex
to be exposed
to that much material
which is designed to be a high impact in
a very short hit i'll give you two
examples
number one
let's say you've got some trauma in your
life
and you say
this trauma is affecting me into my
whole life and i'm worrying about it and
it gives me
all kinds of problems and maybe it does
maybe it does
but here's the best reframe that i've
ever found because like you
i've had problems in my life
sometimes very big
and i find this the most useful reframe
and it goes like this
you had a big problem
not everybody had one
you had a big one
and you know
that you survived
oh you took a beating but you survived
so you know what you can handle
do you know what everybody else doesn't
know unless they had that much trauma
also
do you know what they don't know
they don't know what they can handle
and they're afraid
so a person who has never had a really
big problem
thinks that maybe the maximum that they
could handle
without damage
is much lower
and because they are timid and they will
not go into higher risk categories and
when i talk about risk i'm not talking
about physical risk talking about
embarrassment failure
what other people think of you risk
maybe financial risk that sort of thing
not physical
stay away from physical risk
i'm not i'm not recommending that
but i call this the free money zone the
zone between what ordinary people who do
not have trauma
guiding their lives what they think they
can handle is their limit
that is not your limit
your limit
is amazing
your limit if you've experienced some
serious
 in your life
your limit is almost unimaginable
to most of the world
that's your superpower
you can do stuff
that other people are afraid of i first
noticed this when
i would see that veterans of who had
seen combat when they went into business
were often unusually successful
it was just i i don't know if it's
actually
um statistically true but something i
noticed that people who had gone through
horrible experiences and i'll bet by the
way
um that you would find this
scientifically true but i don't have any
science for it and the idea is that
people have gone through horrible things
just have a higher tolerance for
everything
for everything they know what they can
handle they know what they can push
through they know when they're they're
in the deepest swamp
they say i've i swam through this one
before
i've seen this swamp
this swamp is nothing you think this
swamp is bad you should have seen the
other swamp
this one i'm gonna kill in two days it
took me 16 years to beat that other
swamp
this one
two days
the people who don't have that kind of
problem in their life will never be able
to handle that
that is micro lesson number one it
dovetails into micro lesson number two
this is a reframe for people who have
despair in their lives i'm not going to
use the s word
because i just don't want to put those
words in your head but
you can put it in your own head there
are some people whose lives are so bad
they say i'm not sure my life is worth
going on
i'll bet a lot of people have had that
thought in the past two years especially
and i bet almost all of you have had it
at least once maybe when you were a teen
etc a lot of people go through it
and i'll tell you a reframe that can
take you out of it almost immediately
almost immediately
and
it goes like this
imagine you have one day to live
now you don't have to convince yourself
it's true
and believe me that's that's important
because if you thought to yourself well
you know i know that's not the case
so it doesn't work no it doesn't matter
this is purely a reframe a reframe
doesn't have to be true it just has to
work
it's just a little mental hack
it's a trick
don't get lost on whether it's logical
it doesn't need to be that's not not an
important element of it
if you can just say to yourself
let me live today like it was the last
day
and if you can't convince yourself
that it's really the last day in any way
that you can you know embrace this
feeling
tell yourself this
you have the ability to end it anytime
you want i don't recommend it this is
actually a technique to make sure you
don't right you want to be careful about
this i'm telling you how to get in at
those feelings
if you tell yourself that you have
nothing to lose
because you only have one day
but you're perfectly healthy
only your mind is messed up you're
perfectly healthy let's say let's hope
what would you do
if
nothing could embarrass you
what would you do
if you weren't afraid of anything now
again i'm not talking about physical
fear that can kill you i'm talking about
social
fear fear of what other people think of
you fear of failure what if all of that
went away
because
if you wanted to
you could end your life when you wanted
it is kind of optional if you think
about it and again i'm telling you how
to live your life not end it
what about your feelings of self-worth
all of those things become immediately
useless
if you only have one day to live you do
not worry that you are embarrassed
because you're dead tomorrow
mentally
you know in in this reframe
it is one way to induce what i call
artificial ego death
very similar to what the medical experts
say you would experience with let's say
medically supervised use of psychedelics
such as mushrooms
if you can induce a state
of artificial ego death in which you can
temporarily
and this is how you start just start
with temporary where you can temporarily
imagine
that embarrassment fear self-worth
all the things that are gnawing at you
your sense of failure will you make it
uh who hates you who doesn't all the
things that are just torturing you
those are all your ego
your ego is telling you you're important
and that therefore all the assaults on
your ego matter as soon as you realize
that you're not important
in in this specific sense because in
this artificial mindset that you create
just just to hack your mind you create
this idea that you only have a day to
live
you inhabit it and you say if i only had
a day to live
i could go up to that person that i've
been thinking about
and give them
a flower
and say you know
i know you and i probably will never be
a couple but i just love to give you
this compliment
i just think you're terrific
and then you walk away
and you don't say i must date that woman
or i must marry that man you just say
i really enjoyed giving them a
compliment
you might discover that literally
everybody loves a compliment
i'm going to do a separate biker lesson
but i'll give you a teaser
that if you learn how to compliment
people without being creepy and i could
teach you that
everybody likes it
you can make almost everybody want to be
your friend if you can learn to give a
sincere
non-creepy
compliment
which is pretty much just technique and
i could teach you how to do it
now
this technique
try it
you will not believe it will work until
you have tried it i believe that if you
try either of these two reframes
some number of you will have a profound
impact on your life
so while maybe only one percent of you
maybe 25 percent of you
maybe 50 percent of you
might find something um
substantially useful here
but all of you would find something in
the list of over 200 micro lessons so
that is your
two micro lessons for the day
and
uh on that note i'm going to end the
youtube feed i'll be talking to the
locals people a little bit more and i
hope you found that useful
and i think you'd agree
this was the best life live stream
you've ever seen
or ever will
until tomorrow
see you then
