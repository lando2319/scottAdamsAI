huh
well we got a problem today
you know how every day
I open up the same drawer
and I take out the sheet that tells me
the words for the
the simultaneous sip
well I just opened that drawer
and there's nothing in there
which means I shuffled that paper with
the documents I threw away
which means it doesn't exist unless I
dig through my garbage let's take a vote
should I dig through my garbage in front
of you or should I read the back of my
mug
which do you prefer
read the mug
look at that it's a backup plan
backup plan working like a charm
all right if you'd like to make your day
better and take it up to levels never
before heard before all you need is a
cup of margaritas take your Chelsea
style the canteen jugular flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called
simultaneous step
and it happens now go
I'm feeling a little sorry for the
people who do not have the official
Scott Adams coffee with Scott Adams mug
but maybe someday you'll catch up
well I know what you're thinking today
you're saying to yourself
if Dilbert is only showing on locals
and you say you're doing edgy stuff you
say
that's what you say how edgy is it well
I'll give you a hint
so this week features the new co-worker
Dave
here's Dave
is black but the uh
but the joke with Dave the new engineer
is that he's black but he he only makes
fun of woke stuff
so he pretends to be woke and he
pretends to pull people's legs right
so Dave Dave says in the first panel
he's talking to the boss he says why did
you exclude me from mandatory
sensitivity training and the boss says
you don't need it you're fine the way
you are
and Dave says is it because everyone
will be talking about me and the boss
says only as a hypothetical
all right
now do you think I could have run that
in a regular newspaper
nope
nope because the rest of the work the
rest of the week is on this sensitivity
trading topic
and no I could have not run that in the
newspaper
all right I got a question for you how
many are panicked about the U.S dollar
being lost as the reserve currency in
other words the
the currency that people like to do
International Trade because they think
it's a strong unit and if you trade in
it you can always
you could always turn it into whatever
else you wanted to be
I feel like
this was a big concern that's not a
concern at all
my current thinking about it is it
wasn't even important enough to really
make a headline
so a number of number of you know
semi-large countries and larger ones are
agreeing to trade in their own
currencies
and I don't think that's going to catch
on so I was looking at what the experts
are saying and here's the main thing you
need to know the the one the one
takeaway
yeah Mr Floyd says the dollar will fall
Scott
that now the risk is so let me let me
say the risk the risk is that if people
want
fewer dollars because they don't need to
own them to do trade that there will be
less demand and then the value will fall
and then inflation will soar
well all of that requires requires that
people would prefer holding other
currencies
this is the key to understanding the
whole thing
in order for people to stop using the
dollar for their international trading
they have to think that the dollar is
less stable or less secure
than whatever else they were going to
use and at the moment there's nothing
close
so at the moment the dollar is still the
you know the the one that people want to
own now they could trade gold but that's
not so easy right you're not going to
ship gold around
I suppose you could ship promises to
gold or something like that but I don't
know how much of that goes on
so there's not enough gold somebody says
so at the moment it looks like that was
another
um fake problem
meaning that what makes the dollar
valuable is that the economy of the
United States looks like it's more
stable than anybody else's economy
anybody who looked more stable than us
would probably go down if we went down
in other words the United States if the
United States went down it wouldn't help
you much if you had you know Swiss
Francs or something because everything
would be a Mess by then
so that's my current feeling is that the
reason is not a headline everywhere
is that it's not that big a risk
yet it's possible it could become one
but only if the economy of the United
States became so weak
that people said oh I don't want to hold
those dollars because the United States
is so weak we're not there yet as long
as we have the biggest military we might
not ever get there but
um
but yeah
two-thirds of the world is going to be
on bricks
they can
but
just being on bricks doesn't mean they
wouldn't trade in dollars also does it
the correct can you give me a fact check
on this the countries that are moving
away from the dollar
that's just an extra option isn't it
it's not making them unable to trade the
dollar
and they're still going to prefer the
dollar even if they have an option of
owning owning some weaker currency why
would they take the weak currency
well what would possibly make a company
take a weak currency
if it's the only option but I'm saying
it's probably not the only option
okay well we'll look into that
uh here's a warning of the future the
German federal office of justice is
going to find Twitter
because they say quote the internet is
not a lawless space
says the Justice minister
um
do you remember a prediction I made that
if Google became too independent and too
useful
that it would become illegal
the only reason that that Twitter
can exist is because it's sort of a fair
fight you know the left and the right
are fighting it out well it looks like
kind of a fair fight but if Twitter
becomes the thing that is fact-checking
uh the fake news and it starts doing it
reliably now imagine a world and we
could be less than a year away from this
imagine a world where if somebody wants
to fact check something
they go to Twitter instead of the fact
checkers
because Twitter will put a context note
on tweets
we might be heading there
and that that really is dangerous for
whoever's in power
and so maybe count countries May might
follow Germany's lead
and try to find legal reasons to make
Twitter illegal and actually just put it
out of business
so I think the biggest risk to Twitter
is not that they don't have positive
cash flow I mean that's a big problem
yeah but at least at least Elon Musk
owns them so you know they could manage
it if they need to
um the biggest problem is that Twitter
will become too honest and too useful
through just by adding context to to the
news
and that is going to be illegal because
I don't think the people in charge
let's say they're Democrats uh in this
country you would allow it I think
they'd find a reason to make it illegal
all right
so keep an eye on that yeah we'll talk
about Trump of course
um so Rasmussen polls said 60 of likely
us voters believe violent crime in
America is getting worse
which means that 40 percent don't think
that
40 percent of America does not think
violent crime is getting worse
now this one's not a 25 percenter uh by
18 think the crime problem is getting
better well that's sort of close it's
getting close to 25 percent
it's sort of in the ballpark
and 21
say that's about the same
that was when I read this Statistics I
imagined myself standing in line to vote
just just play the scene in your head
and you you strike up a conversation
with the person next to you who's going
to also vote just a stranger
and you say wow you're not really
worried about the increase in violent
crime in this country
and the person behind you says what
and you say yeah you know the violence
increasing in this country you know
there's
the bail reform
Etc criminals are out there doing more
crimes
and the person behind you says that's
not happening
you go no it is happening in fact it's a
big reason I'm in line to vote and the
person behind you says no I think
actually the crime is reducing it looks
to me like it's going down
how would you feel
knowing that you were the two of you
were wasting your time
you were just canceling out each other's
vote and the person behind you is
canceling your vote is a idiot
so your vote would be canceled by the
dumbest person you've ever met who's
standing behind you in line just
canceling your vote so you stand there
for two hours to vote knowing it made no
difference
no difference
that would make a difference of course
every vote counts you know technically
but it would feel very demoralizing to
know that you were in line with somebody
who was actually voting who hadn't
noticed that crime is getting worse
so good would it
anyway
um this is this should be the biggest
story
and it did make some news
but the reason this isn't the biggest
story
I don't understand you know I guess it's
because Trump's in the news of course
but uh
Democrat Senator Joe manchin is hopping
mad at the Biden administration because
if you remember Mansion reluctantly went
along with the uh what was
euphemistically called the inflation
reduction Act
you know an enormous legislation That
was supposed to do a bunch of good
things and Mansion negotiated to make
sure that before he joined in and he was
sort of a deciding vote that Biden would
promise him that the money would be used
in a way that made sense
and so he was promised that says mansion
mansion voted for it
and then the responsibility for how to
spend it in detail gets farmed down to
the various Administration entities
and apparently according to Joe manchin
those entities are using the money in
exactly the way Biden said it wouldn't
be used
exactly what he didn't vote for
so Joe manchin
prominent Democrat is calling out the
Democrats for a bait and switch the size
of which we've never seen before I think
I mean maybe you could come up with an
example where something like this has
ever happened but the president of the
United States
ran a bait and switch
so egregious that a prominent Democrat
is saying this is over the this is way
over the line
this is horrible for America they lied
to me they lied to me which means they
lied to the country
right because Mansion is part of the
communication of what was in and what
was out this is the worst thing in
America right now
by a mile
name something that's as bad as this
is the biggest news and I saw it in one
tweet
if I'd missed one tweet I wouldn't even
know it was a thing
one freaking tweet
now they're saying that some are saying
that Mansion is lying
and that he didn't know that he did know
how his could be I don't think so
I I mean maybe I'm a bad judge of
character but I saw him talking and he
looked pissed right he did not look like
he was acting he looked pissed like the
real thing
you you can't really act that well
that was genuine anger yeah he got
screwed and he's calling him out now I
don't know if he's going to become a
republican that's that's a lot to ask
but
but uh how is this not the biggest news
how in the world is this enormous
enormous thing of great consequence to
the country
it's a tweet you know it was unbeat the
Press yesterday so it was news but it's
not a headline today
so that's amazing to me
um so let's let's see what were are we
concentrating on instead uh there's this
gigantic Story the main headline that
Trump uh once put a payment that no one
cares about in the wrong column in terms
of you know financial reporting
and there was no there was no victim no
victim nobody was worse off
but there was a payment that might be in
the wrong category
and we're going to pay attention to that
instead of the fact that the entire
country had been baited and switched on
the most significant piece of
legislation in a long time
that's where we are
all right well the continuing
reverberation of Marjorie Taylor being
uh in her 60-minute spirits in which she
suggested that Democrats are pedophiles
and she backed that up by saying that
there's supportive
trans training for kids and trans
exposure to kids and schools and such
is sexualizing kids
no you could argue that point which is
not my intent today
you could say well that's hyperbole
that's sort of stretching a point to you
know make that word fit maybe but I'm
totally in favor of it as long as
Democrats want to call anybody who
supports a Republican
a racist
I'm all in they're all pedophiles
if you'd like to call them that because
I'm done I'm done arguing that somebody
is or is not a racist
that's the Trap the Trap is to get you
to argue that you are not a racist
here's what MTG Marjorie Taylor green
did
she caused Democrats to have to defend
themselves as not being pedophiles thank
you
that is the correct response does she
believe that Democrats are all
pedophiles
no of course not nobody does literally
nobody will that stop people from saying
Democrats or pedophiles I hope not I
hope not because it's the right attack
um
although I'd love to see that modified
into something closer to you know maybe
something closer to you wouldn't want to
have
Democrats watch your kids
so we'll see if that catches on
all right here's the thing that the
Washington Post doesn't understand and
the rest of the media
every time you give Marjorie Taylor
green attention
and you say no no no that's so unfair to
call the Democrats pedophiles
you're you're reminding the public
that somebody has an argument that
they're pedophiles
the more they say it the truer it
becomes in the minds of people who are
watching
so they can't help themselves because
it's just too delicious and they have to
jump in so they're they're basically you
know boosting her signal
and she is an energy monster the more
energy you give her the stronger she
will get and they haven't figured this
out yet because it doesn't work that way
with everyone right that's a trump thing
it's a Mercury tailored green thing
there are a few few people
who will fit in this category but not
many she's definitely one of them she's
an energy monster
but
The Washington Post tried to reframe her
comments about the Dems being pedophiles
as really a
basically a dog whistle against trans
people
did anybody see a dog whistle about
trans people
I'm pretty sure she was only talking
about children
and if you're trying to make that about
trans rights
you're trying too hard
that's a little bit too much work to
defend yourself
so that's a losing play
if the Democrats are going to defend
what Marjorie Taylor green would call
sexualizing children
have at it you should talk about that
all day long let's hear more about how
she's wrong that they're sexualizing
children
now again I'm being very careful I'm not
weighing in on the argument itself I'm
talking about just the persuasion just
the repetition just just what gets put
in your mind at that level and the
Democrats are losing badly
to her at the moment she's absolutely in
control of this conversation energy
monster
so
all right I remind you I'm not agreeing
with anything that or everything that
Marjorie Taylor green has ever said or
will ever say in the future that's not
what I'm about I'm just describing what
she's accomplishing basically
all right uh
here's a mehdi Hassan who I believe is
an MSNBC
uh person is that true I think he's
associated with Democrats I think and he
tweeted this he says thanks Leslie Stahl
in 60 minutes the day after their
softballs and normalization green is not
just doubling down on her quote
Democrats are the party of pedophiles
pedophiles smear but also suggesting
Biden is one himself with horribly
edited videos of him horrific
to which I imagine Marjorie Taylor green
would say
thank you for your attention
thank you for your attention to this
point Thank you for boosting the signal
well
I think the CNN has finally gotten the
message
that the use of the walls are closing in
on Trump
is not the insightful comment that it
once was
and so with great interest I've been
watching how they would modify their
their comments because we like to laugh
at them when they say the walls are
closing in on their headlines so I'd
like to give you
what CNN now has a headline that
apparently is in replace of the walls
are closing in on Trump all right here's
their backup their B plan instead of
saying the walls are closing in on Trump
the headline on CNN website today was
Trump is losing his capacity to control
his fate
what does that sound like
losing his capacity to control his fate
that's a little bit like
I feel like he's being squeezed
it's like he's
being put in a a tight position
what would be another word for that
it's like it's like almost there were
walls of some sort
and in a way it's like there are closing
in on them
or as I like to say he's losing his
capacity to control his fate
well
I would like to agree with the Glenn
Beck and Greg guffeld and I think a few
other people have made this simple same
point
would you say this is true or not
the first time I heard it I thought it
was hyperbole
but today when I thought about it I
realized it had already become a part of
me
now usually that makes no sense when you
say it became a part of me
but watch how it's true this time
the first time I heard oh Trump is a
symbol and I thought yeah yeah yeah you
know we always treat him as a symbol
and then
I'm watching the news today as he's
actually going to be indicted
maybe there's a mug shot is there a mug
shot I don't know but maybe
and today I felt differently about it
here's how I felt about it today
I felt I wasn't being put in jail
it was absolutely personal
did anybody else have that impression
that that when he's actually in the
you know the Department of Justice
facilities when he's physically under
their control
physically under their control
they're not just talking about them
they're not just talking to his lawyers
they have physical control
of the former president of the United
States physical control
that's personal
I feel that
personally
I feel that in my body
in my brain
I feel it in my heart
I feel that in my
pancreas
that is completely personal now and I
wasn't expecting that I wasn't expecting
that when the change was from from a you
know conceptual thing
to the Department of Justice run by the
Democrats have physical control of trump
physical control
that is completely different
it doesn't feel like it used to feel
and I'll tell you one thing
it changes my behavior
here's what the the Democrats and a lot
of Republicans were saying
they're saying that the real trick is
they want Trump to win the primary
but be hobbled in the in the general
election
and I would agree there might be some
people thinking that
there might be some Democrats thinking
that but here's where their calculation
went wrong
it's personal
it's personal this isn't political
anymore
this is beyond this is not politics
anymore this is personal
and people are going to act differently
so so let me let me say with uh
some certainty if Trump gets the
nomination I'm still backing uh Vivek
ramaswamy because I think age is
important and Vivek has the strongest
strongest clearest communication of what
he wants to get done that matches my
preferences
but I think I think in all likelihood if
you sort of sort of game it out the
chances are that Trump is adding the
polls and he and he takes it
if he does I'm going to register and
vote for him for the first time
so I'm going to change my behavior do
you know I'm going to change my behavior
because it's personal
it's personal I'm not going to go vote
for Trump
I'm not going to go to save Trump I'm
not going to go to put Republicans in
office I'm not going to go there to
punish Democrats I'm not going to go
there to get good policies
it's personal
it's personal
I'm going to go there to stay keep
myself in a jail
because if you put him in jail he is the
only thing standing between
the government and me
now some of you are a lot safer I assume
but I'm not
I'm not you don't think they could put
me in jail for some thing
absolutely they can I'm going to vote to
stay on the jail is what I'm
going to vote for I'm not voting for
Trump not voting for Republicans not
voting for policies I'm going to vote to
stay on a jail because that's
how I feel
so if that's how you wanted me to feel
congratulations
that's how I feel
you up bigger than anybody's ever
 up in her whole life
the Democrats have no idea what's coming
and I don't want to see a protest
frankly
I don't want to see anybody risking
themselves I just want you to take care
of yourself
I just want you to take care of yourself
that's it
protect yourself
do what you got to do I'm not talking
guns I'm not talking revolutions I'm
talking about you know what you got to
do
this time do it
this time do it right decide
don't think about it don't talk about it
just decide
it's time to decide
now if they let him out
you know and the whole thing turns into
nothing
then I'm going to say all right you know
back to Politics as Usual
pick your side Etc
but if they take him out
if this actually either doesn't allow
him to run or they put him in jail God
God forbid
that's a different game
and I don't think they quite understand
the level of fire that they're playing
with they do not understand
don't tell them
don't tell them
all right
um
so there aren't going to be the judge
ordered that there aren't going to be
cameras in the proceedings
is my head going to explode right now
really
you're going to take physical
custody of the former president of the
United States with 80 million supporters
and you're not going to show us on the
 camera what you're doing you
better show that
we need to see all of it you need full
transparency this is not like any other
case this is not a criminal situation
this is the future of the
Republic you better show us that I
want to see every part of it
secondly
um
apparently there might be some kind of a
gag order I don't think we know that
that would prevent Trump from talking
about the proceedings
rejected
 rejected rejected
if there's a gag order I want him to
violate it
please I wanted to violate it and if he
goes to jail game on
you can't gag the president of
the United States former president
possible future president you can't
 gag him you can't turn the
cameras off
you can't
unacceptable
unfucking acceptable we gotta see it we
got to see the whole thing
unfucking acceptable
gag order you
 your gag order
 your gag order
I owe if he has one I hope he violates
it in the first second
I want to see him violate the out
of that gag order
um what about the alleged uh
so do you think there'll be a mug shot
or do you think he'll be an exception
mug shot or exception what do you think
probably mug shot
some say exception
yeah
do you know why they would make an
exception
if they make an exception do you know
why
because it would help him
yeah if that mug shot exists you know
the Republicans are going to use it more
than the Democrats right the Democrats
think
I can't wait to get that mug shot you
know what I can't wait to get it
either
I can't wait to get that mug
shot I don't care what expression he's
got in his face I don't care if he's sad
or happy
I want to see that monk shot
because that's going to put him into the
presidency if anything does
all right
um
let me make a prediction for 2024
this will be a conditional prediction
all right so uh I withhold the ability
to change my prediction later based on a
different Theory
the current prediction goes like this
you've heard Elon must say this you've
heard me say it before then
reality tends to follow the path of
greatest entertainment
and you see it over and over again
the path of greatest entertainment
what would be the path of greatest
entertainment
good or bad I'm saying you might hate it
or you may love it but it would be the
most clicky you couldn't take your eyes
off an entertaining thing
the most entertaining thing goes like
this
between now and the election in 2024
Trump is running let's say that he's not
taken out by any legal processes
and wait for it
and the Kraken happens do you remember
the Kraken
that big old thing we were promised
there was going to be news about the
2020 election and how it was allegedly
rigged but no no evidence of that scale
ever came to pass well we've we've kind
of been beaten into submission a little
bit assuming that all the things that
have been proposed or alleged have
either been ruled out or rejected by the
courts or they weren't big enough or
just didn't pan out for some reason see
you're kind of beaten down and you
expect that there would be nothing else
between now and the next election
however
I don't want to give you the details but
there are a number of let's say signals
that are emerging
that definitely are the possibility that
there's something out there really big
that is close to being uncovered
now I'm not going to be the idiot who
who predicts it because you know I'm
more famous for saying that 95 of all
election fraud claims at least the like
a floor would be 95 of all of them are
false
so if I were to bet against my own
prediction that 95 of all election
claims are false I would be a little
foolish
however
if you believe that the most
entertaining option
is where a reality bends
then the most entertaining option is
we've all been wrong and there is a
kraken
let me give you just a
maybe a little hint of where one might
be all right this is a big might
so I want to be very clear because I
know there's some idiots who watch they
sneak in
to the idiots I'm not predicting
necessarily that any of this will pan
out as actual you know election fraud
this at a big scale
but it could
is in the category of
huh
huh it could apparently there's and I'll
try to get this story right there's a
system that a number of states use
is called the Eric system ER IC stands
for something and it's a system that
keeps track of
who's moved from one state to another
so if you're trying to make sure you're
if you're trying to make sure that your
voter roles are accurate one of the
things you want to know is who's
recently moved and maybe who has not
re-registered or whatever
because the last thing you'd want to do
is send a bunch of ballots to somebody's
wrong address and then you've got a
ballot there's somebody maybe you can
fill out illegally
so it's very important to know who has
moved recently and this Eric database is
one of the things that does it now
what's your guess
do you think the Eric database which is
very important to the Integrity of the
elections
do you think that it's run by a
prominent Republican do you think a
bunch of Republicans put that together
oh no no it turns out it's run by a
fairly well-known Democrat
so a Democrat put it together
Zuckerberg had something to do with it
maybe funding or something I don't know
there's some Zuckerberg connection
and
here's a more interesting fact from Rich
Barris who says that the Eric system is
completely unnecessary because the data
already exists and even he has it
so even You Know Rich Barris here on
Twitter you you've seen them talking
about a lot of election stuff
um even he says I have the information
even I have the information if it was
recently moved by States the the Eric
system doesn't even have a purpose
unless
the purpose
is to make it more likely the Democrats
win and there's there's an allegation
that's sort of bubbling up
that the Eric system might be the
primary way that fraud is accomplished
and it's not something you would have
looked at
in other words it's not part of the
election process per se it's more of an
election support system
so if you're looking at the election
it would be hard to detect that anything
was wrong
but if you looked at how we got to the
election
maybe there is no I think I think I've
done a poor job of explaining what it is
and the risk
so if you're interested you should read
on it but the only point I want to make
the only point to make here
is that there might be something that is
really big
that makes a difference to elections and
you didn't know about it
and it could make a big difference
so
I'm not going to say that that's the
thing that's going to be the Kraken
I'm just going to say there are a couple
of things I think there are at least two
other
things that are bubbling up now through
Kerry lake or other things so you might
see you might see it so the the main
reason I would predict it is not because
I think it's likely we'll find election
fraud I still think that's very unlikely
what is likely
well likely is the wrong answer
if the prediction of reality following
the most entertaining path if that
happens it's going to be it's going to
play out that way
so really it's just a way to
um I'd say it's a way to see if that
hypothesis of things following the most
entertaining path
works now I have a I have a hypothesis
why that hypothesis would work
what would be the mechanism that would
cause reality to follow the most
entertaining path
what would cause that to happen
it would be people wanting to be
entertained
it would be people thinking about it
because I have a view of reality that we
think things into reality
that the thing we focus on actually
forms into reality ahead of us
so the more you're thinking about
something bad the more likely it's going
to happen
the more you're focusing on a good
future the more likely that's going to
happen
and I believe that a whole bunch of
people are thinking about election
Integrity in 2020.
and so we might actually think it into
existence
because it's the most entertaining thing
and that's why we think about it a lot
and again entertaining means it brings
our attention to it not that we enjoy it
but our attention is drawn to it
so we might be just thinking it into
existence we'll see
all right I've been trying out my new uh
attack on the woke by simply saying good
performance
because my my theory is that the
wokeness is not about anybody that
they're complaining about when they
complain about me it's not ever about me
it's about them showing themselves in a
certain way it's it's about a peacock
showing his feathers
so instead of arguing on the merits
where I might say no that's not true I
have never been a cannibal
that never works
because you're just repeating yourself
as a cannibal all the time you're making
the Marjorie Taylor a green you know
trap mistake the more you deny it the
more it sounds like it's true
so instead of denying anything from woke
people I'm simply going to call them out
this way here's an example
uh Roy Graham said to me
um Scott oh this this is because I
posted a tweet they asked people if
they'd be comfortable having a Democrat
babysit their children
and 75 percent of the respondents mostly
you know Republicans and troublemakers
uh said no they would not be comfortable
with the Democrat watching their
children
allow me to do a public service address
for the stupid people who may have
wandered it here by accident this
doesn't apply to locals but there might
be some stupid people still on YouTube
and it's important to talk to them
um so when people answered that they
wouldn't want a Democrat to babysit
their kids
that doesn't mean every Democrat
I see I have to talk stupid so the
stupid people will know I'm talking to
them directly they they don't mean every
Democrat
no because if they let's say let's say
maybe their mother
was a Democrat
do they mean that they wouldn't trust
their mother
watching their child no no it doesn't
mean that no stupid people no stupid
people listen to me stupid people it
doesn't mean your mother
it doesn't mean the exceptions it was
just sort of a general feeling of that
all right so that was just for the
stupid people
so
um so Roy talking about that uh Twitter
poll I ran he said Scott
what in all capitals what is the point
of posting this to generate hateful
responses which you will get a lot this
is really low brow and it is not funny
please
to which I responded good performance
Roy well done
how well does that work
is that not perfect
I'm not going to talk to him about his
point because his point was not about
the point do you think the point is
about the point of course not the point
is about Roy
wants you to know who he is okay Roy
that was an excellent performance in
telling us how awesome you are compared
to me
good performance
good performance I am not going to talk
about the details of your criticism
I'm only going to talk about the quality
of your performance
if you want to have an actual discussion
we'll talk about actual real things
happy to do it but if you just want to
perform I'm just going to grade the
performance
nope we're not going to talk about your
double dumb ideas just the performance
good good job Roy
good job
speaking of performance
the most important news in the entire
world is that there was a guy who
said something bad about a woman's
basketball player
who did something that he considered
classless
huge huge story
is so the story is about Dave Portnoy
Barstool
founder Trump supporter
which is probably the key to this Trump
supporter so in a women's basketball
game you've probably all seen the news a
white player mock day black player a
white woman by pointing to the future
ring that she was going to win if they
won the game but I guess the game didn't
go their way at the end and the black
player again coincidence coincidence
that one of them was white coincidence
that one of them was black it's just
basketball players on different teams
and the other one mocks her back you
know by you know pointing at her finger
totally fair game two players mocking
each other
fair game
but of course the one that Dave
fortunately happens to see because I
think it was toward the end of the game
and he makes a comment that she's an
effing idiot
for doing this mocking thing
does anybody care what Dave Portnoy
thinks about one female player's hand
gesture
anybody in the world
does anybody in the world care about
that no of course not did anybody in the
world bother to make a big deal about it
of course they did they made a really
big deal about it is it because they
care what this one person thinks about
one person's hand gesture no
they care that they that they can take
him out
Dave Portnoy is a chess piece
he's actually one of the people who
might actually change votes
because he's that was spoken in Pro
Trump this is everything about taking
players off the off the board
and Performing while you do it
so there's two points there are two
points but none of them have anything to
do with what he did or said
that has nothing to do with the story
The only thing is can people perform let
me tell you how I'm better than the port
Norway I'm better than Dave Portnoy and
here's my reasons why I'm so wonderful
and Dave Portnoy is not
see if you added singing and dancing to
it I think you'd be a better performance
and
uh otherwise it's just trying to take
him off the field because he's a trump
supporter
and I I was looking at who gave the best
woke performance I think it was
Shaquille O'Neal
who said something about his mother
good good performance check excellent we
do not need to know about the issue
because nobody cared
literally nobody cared about the issue
we only care about the quality of your
performance and Shaq we're going to give
you the Academy Award for that
well as I've said a number of times the
Democrats are really the party of women
um
in the sense that women are the dominant
let's say
opinion making Force within the Democrat
Party would you agree first of all the
women are the dominant
policy making force is not all women in
charge like they're not necessarily all
the Senators but they're the primary
influence
in the Democrat Party
and I and somebody said to me
why are you against that
I'm not against it
I'm not against it at all why would
anybody be against it it's just an
observation
can I observe something
why why is that a problem I'm just
observing
no I don't think that's necessarily
not not on the surface I'm not saying
that you know women can dominate a party
sure they can why not that's all part of
the process no problem at all it's just
an observation
now I'm going to extend the observation
is it my imagination or most trans
people who transition from male to
female
most of them are probably lean Democrat
wouldn't you say is that a fair
statement not all
let me take a moment for the stupid
people for the stupid people I don't
mean all of them I don't mean every
trans person is actually a Democrat not
everyone not a hundred percent
okay that's just for the dumb people
but generally speaking when you say
probably lean left yeah
and I thought that this is a
continuation of a theme
that the Democrats are the party of
women
and people who identify as women
but here's the part that I thought was
the best part
that
conservatives seem to be concerned
that their opponents are removing their
own bowls
and I thought to myself
what a weird world
because
I don't know just the way I play it I
play it differently
if I saw that my opponents in any realm
were removing their balls
I'd say
carry on
carry on
I don't want to get in the way of that
I'd like to just stand to the side
and uh carry on
I might want to encourage it
you know what
uh Joe Biden his biggest problem is his
balls if he would get rid of those
be a better world
be a better world I think
so I don't know I just thought it was
funny that uh
Republicans are concerned that their
opponents are are removing their own
bowls
now if you're new to me I'm pro-trans
right totally approach trans adults
right adults do whatever you want I'm
happy to please do whatever you want
it's a free country yeah we'll work out
the details there's lots of stuff to
work out with sports and bathrooms and
stuff like that of course of course
but that doesn't change the fact that
I'm Pro anybody who's an adult you know
living the life they want to live
it's okay with me yeah the children's
stuff is a separate category and I'm not
gonna I'm not even gonna pretend those
are the same
all right um
let's see what else we got going on here
[Applause]
um did anybody see oh
well
um did you ever think that the Democrats
are trying to create a Banana Republic
have you seen anybody say that they're
trying to create a Banana Republic
does that seem ironic given the number
of Democrats who are removing their
bananas
and the fact that it's a female lead
party
I feel like it's a banana-free republic
the Republicans are I'm sorry the
Democrats are trying to turn us into a
banana-free republic No Bananas
and nothing that looks like one
we don't want a banana or anything that
looks like one
if it's a BBC still fine
bbcs are still allowed but if it looks
you know sort of like a banana nobody
wants it
all right
um did you see Megyn Kelly unload on
Leah Thomas the trans athlete swimmer
oh my God and she's not canceled as far
as I know
let me try to summarize what uh Megan
Kelly said
um she said that Leah Thomas who if you
don't know is a born as man transitioned
to a woman in the net is now winning a
bunch of swimming titles by beating the
people who were born as biological women
and
Megan Kelly says
it's a sexual fetish
and that you're we're praising this this
is her opinion that Leah Thomas is being
praised for something that's just a
sexual cake which according to Megan
Kelly is dressing in women's clothes and
that not only does what Megyn Kelly
would call he uh enjoy the dressing in
women clothes but probably enjoys being
in the locker room with naked women
now I don't know if any of that's true
let me be clear I'm not backing that
allegation
I am however interested in why it's not
a valid point
meaning how can anybody tell if
somebody's acting on a sexual fetish
or there's some kind of you know deep
lifestyle
identity situation that you would treat
differently
how would you know
yeah I heard her use the word
autogonophilia is that a real thing
Auto gonophilia
that it's a sexual fetish maybe to
remove your
or to have genitals or something I don't
I don't know what even what that is
but I love
um
oh to imagine yourself as a woman
yeah now as somebody uh crudely pointed
out an erection would answer the
question of whether it's a sexual
turn-on
um there's no report that Leah Thomas
is Leah Thomas intact is that the right
word or is there
Leah Thomas is has not had surgery right
yeah so that that makes it a little uh
extra suspicious doesn't it
makes it a little extra suspicious now
I'd imagine if you were a trans you
would say no it doesn't there's nothing
suspicious about that at all it's just a
lifestyle thing so I'd like I'd like to
acknowledge that that would be a
legitimate opinion
um
I don't know so I had the following
feeling about it when I heard Megyn
Kelly number one
Brave as hell
can we take a moment
to just register How brave that was for
Megan Kelly to
state that opinion loudly and proudly
it's very brave
I don't see her getting canceled for it
maybe it's easier to be a woman in this
conversation it's probably easier to be
a woman
could be part of it it could be because
she had a nerve
it could be because people said oh I
want to cancel you except wait what did
you say
what did you just say
uh how do we rule that out
how do you rule out
that Leah Thomas
potentially is just enjoying the show
I don't know how you roll down
now you know in a country where you're
innocent until proven guilty
you have to act as though there's no
crime
right well it wouldn't even be a crime
would it technically I don't know would
it
well let me ask you this
would it be a crime if you did not
genuinely think you were a woman
then it would right it would totally be
a crime if you pretended to be a woman
just to have access
to the women's locker room that would be
a crime wouldn't it
so how do you know this isn't a crime
and by the way I'm not saying it is
because this depends a hundred percent
on what's happening in a person's head
how they're conceiving of what they're
doing we have no insight into Leah
Thomas we can't know what's in the head
so I'm not saying that there's anything
wrong
I'm saying that you can't tell
so it's you know then you'd have to ask
the question if you can't tell there's a
crime
isn't it wrong and unethical to call it
out as it may be a crime
that's an argument I would listen to
that as well
yes we cannot leave read minds so there
wouldn't be no way to know
no way to know you know I was hoping
that the Leah Thomas thing would
be the straw that broke the camel's back
so to speak
that uh
that more more biological men would
pretend to be women there's a some
weight lifter who won who holds the
record for women's weightlifting that's
basically a guy who wanted to prove a
point so he identified as woman just to
win the contest I thought that that
would be so massively done
that the whole thing would fall apart
but apparently there are not enough
people like me
there are not enough people like me
to play practical jokes on the system
Until It Breaks so I guess that's not
going to happen
it broke the camel's toe that's funny
um
yes well I think Martina navatra Lova
had the best opinion which is by the way
very close to mine
all right so this is Martina navachalova
she says that the trans should not
compete the born as men should not
compete against the born as women
and but she does say that a third
category should be created so you'd have
men's women's and then open the open
category would be anybody who identifies
as anything who just did not fit
comfortably in one of the other two
categories
and
that feels okay to me now of course
there's a
you know it's expensive to create a new
league you know if you were a school
system and you were let's say you're
required to do it you might have five
people
who would you know you would even maybe
have a basketball team you wouldn't have
enough people
but maybe it doesn't have to be school
against School
you know maybe several schools could get
together and say you know all trans
athletes who were born male those are
the problematic ones
um can play against each other they got
their own league and by the way anybody
else can play too you don't have to be
trans but it would be a league where you
could be if you want to would that work
actually I could imagine myself playing
in the trans open League
I can imagine that if I were to play
soccer in high school
and you said you could be on the men's
team
or you could pretend to be a woman I
suppose no you can't do that anymore I
couldn't be on the women's team so I
could be on the men's team and I would
be competing against the best male
players therefore I would sit on the
bench
follow me on this right I'd be playing
against the best male players
so I'd probably sit on the bench
if I if I join the trans League that
wasn't just trans is anybody who wanted
to play
I would play against people who were you
know I'd end up in some League that's
similar to my skill set there'd be some
women in it who were good at soccer
there'd be some trans athletes in it of
course and I'd be playing on an even
field with people I I was competitive
with
fine that would work perfectly for me
so I do like that idea I don't know how
practical it is to form a new league
it's a little impractical but not so
impractical you couldn't do it and and
I've I've often said that the male and
female binary
is only good for the top athletes the
top female athlete yay gets a college
scholarship
the worst female athlete doesn't get on
the team or sits on the bench
same with the men gay college
scholarship get all the girls you're the
you're the captain of the football team
look at you
the lowest athlete doesn't get on the
team
or says on the bench you need a league
for those people
that's the league I want and if trans
could fit comfortably in that League
because the only thing that matters is
how well you play not anything else
good idea
so I'm I'm going to back that concept
all right
ladies and gentlemen is there any other
big
um story that I missed
is there anything I'm ignoring that you
think I should not have
um Chinese radiation proof soldiers
I've somehow ignored that yeah Finland
has joined NATO which nobody cares about
does anybody imagine that Finland
joining NATO would make a big difference
to anything
I mean Russia won't like it but was
Russia going to attack Finland
you know was Finland at risk of attack
it looks like it changes nothing to me
it looks like something to talk about
but not something that matters
bricks is growing but again as long as
the U.S economy is strong people are
going to want dollars to
um
oh interesting I just saw a comment that
I don't know the story behind but the
comments said that Greg Abbott governor
of Texas wants overdose deaths by
fentanyl to be murder
which would mean that the the dealer
would be guilty of murder yes
yes thank you yeah in fact I would go
further I would say that dealing
fentanyl uh Beyond some scale right I
wouldn't talk about the smallest dealers
this special case
but if you're a professional Mass
fentanyl dealer that should be the death
sentence
death sentence because that's mass
murder
if there's somebody who's moving product
to ten thousand people
and I I assume there's some big dealers
who are moving to ten thousand people if
you give fentanyl to ten thousand people
you're going to lose 5 10 100 I don't
know you're gonna kill mass number of
people
that person should be executed
who disagrees
a mass fentanyl dealer the big ones just
the big ones that should be murder
that should be absolute death sentence
no doubt about it
here's uh oh we've got another dumb
person entering the books so Mike K I'll
need to talk to him like a dumb person
to respond to he yells in all caps just
stop popping pills
so could I take a moment just to talk to
the dumb person here all right Mike
you're thinking about uh addiction like
you're thinking about M MS
M M's you could stop taking
an addiction means you can't stop it
it's taken over your brain Mike Mike If
people could just stop taking fentanyl
we wouldn't have a problem Mike but you
can't stop it
you can't that's what an addiction is
and by the way Mike they don't even know
they're getting Fentanyl
and Mike responds yeah just stop
good job Mike good job
all right
I believe
I've mocked Mike enough
um
get a hose again what
NPC alert
uh
um more mocking please
does uh does everybody appreciate it
when I give the special announcements to
stupid people
this is a mixed bag
some no some yes
sub no I guess you don't want to be
under receiving end
all right
um
and oh here's another all caps I've
noticed that all the dumb people like to
Signal their uh
who they are and Jacob De Caliente says
stop taking drugs better yet do not
start
you know
if only somebody had thought of that
stop taking drugs
way better yet hold on better yet
don't take them in the first place
problem solved people problem solved
foreign
caps lock on full
flavorism is racism
yeah even better even even better
oh my God even better
don't create drugs
have I just solved the drug problem
it feels like it in my head
don't create any drugs
well that would end everything
yes yes
let me write that down
all right YouTube you've had enough of
me bye for now best live stream you've
ever seen until tomorrow let's keep an
eye on this Trump situation
