good morning everybody and welcome to
either
the best show in the history of
civilization or an embarrassing
covered adult brain
demonstration that will haunt me for the
rest of my life
it's going to be one of those two things
and you
ladies and gentlemen and everything in
between you are
the judges and the juries for this
presentation this will not be a normal
live stream
no
today you are the judge to see if my
brain fog from my covent has lifted yet
you will be the judge because you know
who can't tell
me
so will i produce my usual superb
analysis
and
clearly demonstrate that my brain is
working at a hundred percent
or will it be lacking a little bit
those of you who have watched me a
little while
you be the judge today will be the test
now if you'd like to get this off to a
good start i know you do all you need is
a couple of marker glasses tank your
chelsea steiner canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine today thing makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
you're about to enjoy it go
ah
yes
well catching you up if you did not know
i tested positive for
covid on saturday
today is tuesday
and i thought i'd give you an update
and so just before i came on here
i took another
test to see if i still have the covet
does anybody want to look at this test
and tell me the answer
because i couldn't see it from where it
was laying there
all right
somebody i'm going to show it to the
locals people first
all right locals
uh oh
yeah that's not just covet
that line is so uh strong it's like
super covered
i believe i have now passed into some
kind of
ultra covid situation
you know
ultra mega was impressive
but ultra covered
boom
that's what i got stay away stay away
stay away
now when i want to not spend time around
people
instead of making excuses like oh i have
to work or
you know whatever
i'll just take this out this would be
like a cross that gets rid of vampires
back off back off
20 feet 20 feet 20 feet
so i think this will keep
keep me lonely for a while
but let me give you the
update on the symptoms
so first day saturday horrible second
day i would say the symptoms were gone
70 percent
by the second day
but 30 of that was still pretty rough
right it was that's still 30 of
something that sucked so day two wasn't
too fun
day three
it looked like it was another 70 or so
and here was my experience
i had a sudden
almost unnatural recovery
that happened within a few hours
now
isn't that weird
so what drug did i take or what medicine
or medicines did i take that caused me
to go from really
you know head foggy
uh
tired couldn't
couldn't move basically
and then suddenly
boom
i i didn't have any symptoms at all
that i could identify
what was it
here's the answer
apparently it just does that
here's everything you need to know about
everything you've ever heard about what
works and what doesn't work
with covet
i don't think it matters what you do
i didn't do anything that should have
made a difference i took tylenol
right
smoked weed drank coffee which i do
every day
so
the
so remember i told you that when i first
contracted it it was obvious it was
coveted i mean if anybody had been
paying attention
it was obvious
and part of why it was obvious is that i
never felt anything like it
it just didn't feel like a normal
illness
at all
because it affected my brain
i've never had that before have you
any kind of illness that directly
affected your cognition
and it was pretty bad there there were
simple things that i couldn't figure out
you should have seen me try to send a
text message
there was a period when it was sort of
peaking in intensity
when i would type a text message and i
would look at it it would literally just
be
random letters
it wasn't they weren't even close to
words they weren't even close
and i'd look at him and say oh i guess
you know i guess i had been like one
over or something sometimes your
keyboard hand is like one letter over so
i'd type it again
pay more attention and i look at it
again like
still not even close to words
i you wouldn't even know what word i was
intending
i was trying to do searches on
google but fortunately google knows how
to
translate your misspellings to real
words
i think i think every word i tried to
spell was misspelled
like a lot
it was the cognitive part was pretty
intense
but here's my bottom line everybody who
took
anything
on the third day
believes that they had a miraculous
recovery because of what they did on the
third day
because i didn't do anything
and i had a miraculous recovery that
didn't look natural
that the fact that all of my symptoms
went away within just a few hours
instead of sort of gradually wearing off
nothing like that happened
the the
the body ache and the symptoms
came on within
one hour
when i got it and when they left
it felt like they left in this in an
hour
now nothing about that feels natural
nothing
i'm not saying that means it was an
engineered virus
but i've never felt anything that came
on that fast or left that quickly
after
two and a half days so now imagine if i
had successfully gotten the pax-lovid
drug
that i had initially thought about but
was too mentally incompetent to make it
happen
later i changed my mind and decided i'd
be better off writing it out
but imagine if i gotten it
i would have gotten it and taken it just
hours before
all of my symptoms went away on their
own
miraculously what would i have concluded
would i have recommended to you that you
take pex love it i would
i would
because if i felt that bad for two and a
half days
and within hours of taking a particular
drug i felt completely better
you don't think i would recommend you
take that drug
and i would be completely wrong
i mean maybe it is a good drug i don't
know i'm not a doctor don't take my
advice
whatever you do by the way yeah let me
stop here
make sure you're not taking any medical
advice from this
that there's nothing like that happening
here what i'm trying to tell you is that
anything you heard about ivormectin
hydroxychloroquine
paxlovid
remdezvir you name it anything you heard
where somebody's symptoms you know
very quickly turned around
how can you
distinguish that from what happened with
me
now how many of you had a similar
situation where you didn't take any um
anything they should have helped
and you had a very quick turnaround
yeah you see in the comments in the
locals it's a little faster
right you're seeing yeses right yes yes
yes yes yes right
so
everything that you heard about
something that definitely worked
no way to know
no way to know
all right
um and then of course today there's an
article of course
about paxlovid so that's the pill you
take
one of the pills you take if you have
symptoms
and it says that you can get a rebound
thing and still be contagious after you
take it and blah blah all right
so
there's that i'm glad i didn't take it
um
i watched the norm mcdonald's special
the one he he recorded just in his house
before he
passed
and
it was disturbing
it was disturbing because you knew he
was so close to his death and that he
knew it when he was doing it and he had
a number of jokes about
about death
and i have to i have to admit it was a
little jarring
now here's a story
i've told some of you you've heard
before and i can tell it because he's
he's passed
but a few years ago
uh norm contacted me
and apparently he was
he had followed me to some degree i
don't know i think he may have read one
of my books or something
and i think he might have seen my live
streams
so he contacted me on twitter i think
and asked if i would take a call so i
did
so i talked to him and i didn't know
that he was dealing with a
you know terminal cancer
but he asked me about dealing with
pain
so apparently he had some kind of
ongoing pain that
drugs weren't doing the job for for
whatever reason and he asked me if
hypnosis
would be a potential solution to that so
i told him what i knew about it which is
some people do get some relief from
hypnosis it kind of depends
right i'm not going to say it's going to
work on every kind of pain in every
situation
i don't know that to be true
but
you hear enough reports about people
anecdotally
who feel like they handled their pain so
i thought it was worth trying
and
so because i had that little bit of
encounter with him
and then after the fact i realized how
meaningful it was
i mean i thought it was plenty terrible
that he had to deal with this chronic
pain i didn't know how bad it was
or that it was part of a terminal
situation
so i i found it hard to watch
but i recommend it highly
because you do see
you know one of the greatest of all time
um
putting out some material you haven't
seen before and that alone is worth
watching
i also watched ricky gervais
his new stand-up special that the trans
community is getting up in arms for and
it's kind of interesting because
he says so directly that these are just
jokes
and that he says things just for a fact
he says that in the act
you know he pauses and said you know i
just say this for a fact right it's just
to offend you and make people laugh i
don't mean any of it
and to me
that should be good enough
but the fact is that some things do
offend people
just the topic itself you know it just
feels like it's you're making it too
easy to mock them or something
so
uh
i felt that this is one time that ricky
gervais was trying a little too hard
to be dave chappelle
uh i hate to say that
but that's what it felt like
because remember how impressive it was
when chappelle
handled
you know basically a similar situation
and he did it you know you woke this
let's say wokeness in particular not the
trans issue
but when chappelle did his special it
was just sort of genius
you know and it it showed that somebody
could talk about complicated
emotional topics and still make it all
work
and i felt like gervais wanted to enter
that same space
and i guess he did it success
successfully
i'd say he did it successfully you know
he he did occupy the space and he did
got away with it
you know by his standards
uh but i felt like it was a little
forced that's all i felt like he was i
felt like he was trying to get into that
space
more than he was trying to just make us
laugh
so it felt like there was a burden on
the writing
that's what i felt
it's sort of just a weird writer's take
on it but do i recommend it yes
yes i recommend it
so in terms of things you could watch
that would entertain you yeah yeah you
should watch it
definitely watch it
um
here's a hoax update
so
jeffrey goldberg
who may or may not have ever promoted
any hoaxes in his past
tweeted this he said a reminder that on
memorial day 2017
donald trump and john kelly his chief of
staff visited the arlington national
cemetery grave of kelly sun a fallen
marine officer
trump turned to kelly and said quote i
don't get it what's in it for them
so that's what uh jeffrey goldberg says
happened in 2017.
mark hemingway
countered with a tweet of his own saying
a reminder more than 20 people with
knowledge of what occurred with trump on
this trip went on record to say
goldberg's anonymously source story is
bunk
okay
now
do you did you believe even for a second
that this was true
i mean just listen to this again do you
believe that trump would have stood next
to a grave
with kelly and you know where his fallen
marine son was and turned to kelly and
said i don't get it what's in it for
them
does that even sound a little bit like
something he would do
like even if you assume the worst things
about trump are true
he's always been respectful to the
military
has anybody been more consistent
in being respectful to the military
in all the ways that he can figure out
how to do it right i mean even if he you
know missed a salute here or there i
don't know maybe he did
but
clearly his intentions have been so
consistent for years and years i mean
so it's just a ridiculous hoax and i
can't believe anybody tried to promote
that one
but somebody will believe anything all
right when i put out my uh
hoax quiz i had 10 popular hoaxes on it
and i invited you to borrow it so you
could share it with people who try to
argue with you online
but if they believe any of those 10
hoaxes you can say to yourself
i'm not dealing with a clever person
here
and that might be useful
but
i was one-upped
by a user who said 10 here's my list of
i don't know 25 or 30
hoaxes
what would be better what is more
persuasive
10 hoaxes
or let's say 30.
if i were trying to convince you let's
say a democrat
that the democrat side
um was doing a lot of hoaxing
and then it makes a big difference in
how they see the world would i be more
convincing with 30
or with 10
the answer is probably 10.
now i say probably because i think you'd
have to do like a proper scientific
study to know which really makes a
difference could be that the bigger
number influences people
but i don't think so and here's why
if you only do 10
you can make sure that you pick the ten
that are the strongest cases
if you pick 30 you will necessarily
have things that are weaker
than whatever your best 10 was
right
so your goal would be to have the most
number
without getting into any weak ones
because when i looked at the list of 30
even i said that's not that's not a hoax
that's marginal
so i'm completely on the side of
the hoaxes bay hoaxes
but even i didn't believe the list of
30.
you get that
like i'm completely primed to believe
that the democrats are hoaxing
everything you know i've seen so many of
them but even i couldn't believe the
list of 30.
the list of 10 is hard enough to believe
as it is and that's actually part of his
strength
because you want people to see that
there are like eight things on there
that even they know are hoaxes
and then there are two on there that
they think we're real and they're like
uh
oh
if the other eight are fake
maybe these other two are fake too
so
the laundry list persuasion is one you
need to guard against
when somebody's using it against you
because if somebody has a list
you just sort of think something on that
list must be true
but
um if you want to be the one who's the
persuasive one
then using laundry list persuasion
actually unfortunately it works i'm not
sure it's the
most ethical thing you could ever do
but it works now in this case it's
ethical
in my opinion
because everything on the list is true
as far as i know
and the purpose of
the purpose of promoting it
is to make the world smarter and better
right so that feels ethical enough to me
um
yes and there's somebody saying here if
there's one cat
that doesn't belong in your house
you might be able to get rid of it but
if there are 10 cats you're gonna have
to deal with the root cause you know
there's maybe a root problem here or
something
all right
elon musk is uh
you know sort of doubling down on his
voting
republican
but he said that
and that he has a reason for why the
democrats may have turned so negative
lately
and apparently some of that negativity
is hitting him he says
that
that there was somebody who donated lots
of money
to
political action committees posing as
charities and that all that money is
causing a lot of you know negativity to
come into the system and that the person
who donated all that money was jeff
bezos ex-wife
mackenzie scott is her last name i guess
and
uh
so bosc is like directly saying that her
money
uh
has changed things into a bad thing and
so much so that he's escaping the
the democrats
all right
uh and musk says that it's true that
tesla was attacked by romney in two or
three presidential debates
but he says those lines were fed to him
by a particular individual in the oil
and gas industry so musk knows a lot
about what's behind the curtain
like he even knows the person who gave
romney the talking points
so that that's pretty far behind the
curtain
um
and he says given the unprovoked attacks
by leading democrats against me meaning
uh musk
at a very cold shoulder to tesla and
spacex i intend to vote republican in
november i love the fact that he's using
his own vote
as a public political weapon
who else could do that
imagine if i went public and said
i'm going to change my vote and the
entire world would say
so
what's that got to do with me
go vote any way you want citizen
but when the the richest person in the
world
says he's going to change his vote and
then shows his work it tells you why you
kind of pay attention
i feel like he could move the needle i
mean i don't know how much but
like i know i couldn't or anybody else
but i think he could actually move the
needle
by saying if you don't act better i'll
vote for the other team
now what is it that
democratic voters get wrong all the time
what democrat voters get wrong all the
time
is they'll vote for their team no matter
what the team does
i suppose you could argue that
republicans do that too
but if people are just team voters we're
doomed
so the richest
maybe one of the smartest people in the
world
just showed democrats how they can
retake power
stop voting for the people that are
screwing you
do you know how big a lesson that is
stop voting for the people who are just
screwing you like they're screwing you
right in front of you they're not even
pretending they're not screwing you
i mean they're screwing
musk like right in front of his face
so why would he vote for them
now i love the fact that he's not saying
i love republicans and i endorse all
their policies
he's literally just punishing democrats
for big
am i right
which is actually a really useful
impulse
because simply saying stuff doesn't
really change things but he actually
changed his vote and he's willing to
change his vote to vote for a team that
has policies that i think just guessing
he hates
i'm just guessing
because yeah i don't think he's a
conservative so don't you think there
are some conservative policies some
republican policies that he probably
hates
but he's still going to vote for him
to punish the democrats
that is really useful
if he if he taught the whole country to
do that
just punish your team if they're
obviously just abusing you
i don't know i think we'd come out ahead
wouldn't we
we'll see so
every time every time he makes a move it
has a like a societal
impact that's hard to judge
good news in indoor farming maybe
outdoors too
there's now a really good farm bot
a robot
that can uh plant your seeds and water
it and and it can uh
pick the weeds and it can fertilize it
exactly the right amount and basically
every
every kind of plant will get its own
special treatment
and that and i thought to myself
i believe that there's a 10x improvement
in indoor farming that we're going to
see in the next few years
and
all you need to do is be able to build a
cheaper structure
right the indoor part
so if we can figure out how to make
you know a durable
easy structure that'd be half of it
then the robots will get rid of the
labor because they can work all day long
and they can do it perfectly they'll get
rid of the fertilizers
um or not necessarily they don't get rid
of the fertilizers they get rid of the
pesticides
right because there's no bugs i i think
the robot could probably even squash a
bug
they didn't teach it to do that yeah
it's hydroponics probably
so i think the yields and there and also
i think learn to grow better vertically
because they don't have the vertical
thing down
as well as they could so i think there's
going to be better mirrors better
lighting
cheaper electricity
fusion who knows
but whatever they do i think there's
going to be a 10x improvement in indoor
farming and that will
make us a lot safer the next time
there's a food shortage
speaking of food shortage
we have we have two gigantic problems in
the world one is that wheat looks like
it's going to be greatly constrained
so the supply of wheat
will be so constrained that poor
countries will
are predicted to have starvation
it's a big problem
second big problem
obesity in rich countries
caused by
caused by
too much bread well you know other
things too but
too much bread
so
if we have rich countries who have too
much bread it's making them unhealthy
and yet you're poor countries who are
going to starve because they don't have
enough
wheat is there no way we can solve two
problems at the same time
okay i get it there's a distribution
challenge sure i get it but it's such a
big problem
i feel like
you know you could make those
adjustments
i'm taking this personal
i don't mean to take your bread away
from you
now somebody said you can't take bread
away from you know the rich they will
fight to keep it to which i say well
if it's not on the shelves
what are they going to be fighting to
keep
so
i feel as if the biggest
category in my supermarket is bread
bread related things i don't think we
have a bread shortage i think we have
like way too much bread
so
maybe the reason that it looks like an
emergency but we're not treating it like
one
is that it isn't one
maybe people just adjust what they eat
and everything's fine i don't know maybe
maybe you just eat more vegetables
um
ceo of airbnb brian chesky
says that the open office
plan for uh for
you know cubicles or non-cubicles i
should say is dead
and that uh the old the old way of the
open the open floor plan with these
meeting rooms that everyone's waiting in
line to get in and no one can find a
meeting room all of that is i think a
thing of the past
so
people will be trying to redesign the
office of the future and it might
include
coming in for a week every quarter to
you know
bond i don't know
does it feel like the cubicle is dead
i mean i tried to kill cubicles for 33
years but it looks like it took kova to
to do it
cute now cubicles will probably always
because they're cheap as long as they're
cheap they're just still going to be
used
there will be some cool high-tech
companies that try other things and then
give up on them later
um it seems to me that biden his uh
strategy for ukraine is now clear
for a while it was a little murky but
now it's clear and i would call it the
the afghanistan strategy it's basically
the same as the afghanistan strategy
which you could call losing expensively
losing expensively
so it's two parts
there's the losing
but there's also spending way too much
money to do it
now winning would look like winning
economically
that's what that's what a good outcome
would be but if you are losing
and you're spending way too much money
to do it that's sort of the afghanistan
strategy
so at least we know what he's up to
and i i think we can say at this point
that
here's another example of wanting versus
deciding
you know how we were trying to decide
what is it that putin really wants with
ukraine does he want the whole country
or does he want that the region he's
consolidating now
and it always seemed like both didn't it
it was like well
like he sort of acted like he wanted the
whole country but maybe that was a fake
out maybe he never did maybe he just
wanted the other stuff but i think
here's a better way to look at it
it's the difference between what you
want
and why you decide
i believe putin decided
to take over those territories he's
taking over right now
meaning that once he had decided there
was no price he was unwilling to pay
it looks like it it looks like he would
be willing to pay any price
to take over those territories so that
looks like a decision
and i as i told you before if he ever
decides
he wants any part of ukraine he's going
to have it
because he will be able to take however
much pain it takes and then he'll just
have it it looks like that's what he's
doing
you know any amount of cruelty any
amount of loss of lice or russians any
amount of military degradation any
amount of sanctions
apparently he's
he's just going to do it
but
did he think the same way about all of
ukraine and kiev
i don't think so
i think all of ukraine is something he
wanted
but he had not decided on it and that
when it looked like it was hard to get
he said well okay
yeah
it kept their army pinned down and so it
did his job we'll just take the part we
care about so i think the wanting versus
deciding frame helps analyze that one
here's the most optimistic stupid thing
you've ever heard in your life
you got a big problem with
national debt am i right
national debts through the roof
you'd like to solve that don't you
wouldn't you you got another big problem
inflation
inflation gigantic problem you'd like to
solve that wouldn't you
do you know what solves
national debt
inflation
you can inflate it away
[Laughter]
now don't get me started on
why that's a bad idea
yes that's the low iq take
now it's both it's both literally true
that probably the only way to get rid of
a debt this big is to inflate it away
but you want to do it with you know a
reasonable level of inflation you don't
you don't want to do it with runaway
inflation
that doesn't get you the wind you wanted
everybody okay with that
that you want some inflation because
we'll probably never be able to pay it
down
you want the value of that those dollars
that we borrowed just to
reduce over time because everything
inflates yeah even if it's just two to
four percent a year
but you know if you're up to eight
percent a year inflation or something
like that that's a little too fast a
little too fast
all right
oh my god this is the left-wing robert
rubin nonsense i just said don't take it
seriously
is somebody taking that seriously
no you i'm pretty sure that you want a
small amount of inflation
if you ever want to get rid of your debt
but a big amount would be a bad idea all
right
uh canadians looks like uh they're
proposing this legislation to
cap their guns meaning that you wouldn't
be able to buy another handgun or
or any gun i guess if you're a citizen
they can keep the ones they have
but you wouldn't be able to get a
anything
else you wouldn't be able to import it
you wouldn't be able to get anywhere
else
now people are going to say well if
canada can do that
why can't the united states does anybody
want to answer that question if canada
can do this
why can't the united states
go
well let me jump in with my answer while
you're giving your answers
because they live next to the united
states
if canada were ever let's say
attacked by a tyrant who wanted to
occupy the country
it would take 10 minutes for the united
states to flow 200 million guns into
canada
that they'll never be short of guns
canada will always have
all the american guns they want to use
because we're not going to let canada go
under
have you met us canadians let me talk to
you directly canadians
you might think that americans are kind
kind of sometimes you're not
wrong you're not wrong
well we're kind of bastards
yeah we're kind of bastards sometimes
we're a little selfish we're cruel
we're uh bigoted we're
we're racist we're sexist
we're a lot of things
it's all true
but
canadians
if your ass gets in trouble
call us
seriously
call us
we're gonna save you every time
every time right
so you don't need guns that much
i mean at least for that one specific
you know use you don't need guns
now you might be feeling unarmed against
criminals and stuff like that
that's not arrogant
is it arrogant to say that america would
come to the rescue of canada if that
were ever important
no because canada would do the same
thing
can the canadians imagine any scenario
in which the united states was seriously
at risk from a
from an outside force
and canada would not mount uh its
maximum military effort to jump into the
fight of course not it's just automatic
right canada and the united states are
just linked and that's not going to
change
we're just linked militarily
so
it's not arrogant to say that if canada
ever got in trouble the united states
would be there in a heartbeat
that's just common sense because it
would work both ways
all right
so
um
anyway
rasmus in his poll says uh 76 percent of
people this is the people who very much
support it and kind of support it
support some kind of red flag rules for
guns
meaning that
a citizen could petition the court i
guess to have someone else's gun taken
away
if there's evidence that that person
is
a high level danger with a gun
76 percent of the public supports that
do you
now
let's take a take for granted that every
any law can be abused
so if you say the reason you don't agree
with it is because the law can be abused
that would be a reason to not agree with
any law
because
every law can be abused
we have laws against rape
has anybody ever been falsely accused of
rape
yeah
i mean almost everything can be abused
so
do you say that you shouldn't have a law
because it might be abused
that's not a good enough reason
i mean you'd have to be able to measure
the size of the abuse well how about
this
if you think it's a good idea
you're wrong
and if you think it's a bad idea you're
wrong
why
can anybody answer the question so
there's my opinion if you think that the
red flag rules are a good idea you're
wrong if you think they're a bad idea
you're wrong
why do i say that
because you can test it thank you
anthony
anthony
if you can test it you're having the
wrong debate
the debate is where do we test it
that's it
unless you want to go full
constitutional and say
you know
it's yeah it's a it's a red line don't
test it but if you want to know if it
works
find someplace that wants to test it
find out right you don't have to debate
it just test it
all right
um
and so therefore i don't have an opinion
i don't have any opinion on it because
it can be tested
um
an israeli cyber security company
says that twitter has 12
bot related traffic at least
now the way that they calculated i think
is a little bit
up to debate
because they don't have internal twitter
numbers they're just they're just
looking at external sites that
originated from twitter and you know
they think they've got it figured out
but uh i feel like
the asking price for twitter is going to
go down
meaning that
correct me if i'm wrong because i
haven't done a merger of this size
but when you make a deal for a certain
dollar amount
and then there's a disclosure period
right
where you find out if you're really
buying the thing you thought you bought
if you dig in and find out the number of
bots is way different
than what you thought when you made your
offer
then you would have cause to renegotiate
you say okay we've already said yes
but now we found that this asset is not
as valuable as we thought so let's
decrease it by 12
and i'll decrease my offer by 12 or
whatever the numbers are
the offer price will go down not the
asking
right the offer price will go down
did i say something else
yes the offer price will go down
um
maybe so we'll see if that happens
so somehow the eu
the
european union block
of them have decided to uh
on on monday i guess just yesterday
decided to cut around 90 of all russian
oil imports over the next six months
and they currently import 25 of their
oil from
from russia
now is 25
so much oil that they can't get that
from other sources
i feel like 25 is about the amount
you can
you can get over in other words it's not
so much oil
that you can't find other sources
in six months
now i imagine that they would not have
made this
agreement
if they didn't know they could work it
out or at least they didn't have a plan
yeah gas is the big issue is somebody's
saying it's not oil is not the big issue
it's the gas
because that's a little harder to
source
the north sea is running dry somebody
says
uh and hungary can still pipe that yeah
so it makes you wonder why it took so
long and one of the
one of the lessons that you can you
learn and relearn all of your life
is that things that seem essential often
are not
have you ever been in a company with a
key employee
who if that one employee left everything
was going to go to hell
and then that one employee left
and everything was fine
how many of you been in that situation
the key employee left and everything was
fine
yup yes yes yep
and look at all the yeses going by on
the on locals right
so
uh i feel like this is another example
that if you tell me that no no no we
cannot find another source for 25 of our
whatever
unless it's you know rare earth
materials and it's you have to do it in
a week
i'm going to say i feel like you can
always
you can always cut things by 25
you it doesn't matter what the category
is not always right but like 95 of all
situations in the world
you can cut 25 off it and hardly notice
you'll make adjustments
all right uh
let's talk about putin's health so
that's in the news again i would like to
remind you of my record of
determining the people's uh physical
health by looking at them
right
first time i did this publicly that i
could remember
was i said the 2016 election day hillary
looked sick
does anybody remember me saying that a
lot
hillary looked sick
or drunk or something and then she did
collapse at the 9 11 event and there was
some kind of health
issue that i don't think has been fully
disclosed
and would you say that i was correct in
2016 when i said
she looks
unhealthy
correct or not correct
because many and she had that cough that
was weird right it seems correct you
know she had walking pneumonia or
something and maybe i saw it but i think
i was saying it even before the
pneumonia kicked in alleged pneumonia
now so that was my first one i think
that's i give myself a yes on that
correct
then i also said when biden was running
wait a minute as many of you did
he's clearly mentally incompetent
and i heard from somebody who knew him
personally and was in the room with him
recently and said you know you're
totally wrong scott
i recently talked to him in person
he's fine
to which i said
i don't think so i
yeah i don't think so
and
as of today
wouldn't you say i was right
that he's not made mentally capable and
that i think he's declined even in the
last year in a way that's obvious to
most people
so i think i'm two for two
would you would you allow that
score to stand two for two
um
and now i say that putin is sick
now i'm not going to say he's terminal
i suppose we're all terminal
but
there's something wrong with that guy
so i'm i'm going to try to go for a
three for three there's just something
wrong with that guy don't know what it
is could be his meds
you know maybe it's a not a bad problem
but his meds are causing him to act
differently or something i don't know
well we'll see
uh
surprisingly the delorean is back
you remember the delorean
with the gull wing doors and back back
in the future sort of thing
and
i guess the founder of the original
delorean got busted for
selling cocaine to finance his car or
something like that was that the story
anyway
it's coming back as an electric car
and
um has two doors still has that gull
wing thing
and it sort of it would compete with you
know a tesla for example
but the design is really
really good
so one of the things that the delorean
did well is it look cool
it's one of the things that musk got
right with his original
uh his first electric car it looked cool
but
i'm not sure that the tesla design in
its current form
people buy because of the outside design
let me ask you how many of you think
that a regular tesla no let's not talk
about the truck because that's more of a
high design situation but how many of
you think that the ordinary tesla
has a look where you look at and say
got to get some of
that um so you it's a mixed bag of
saying a lot of people are saying it's
ugly but other people are saying uh they
like it
uh
yeah
so some people are saying it's nice some
people say man now at one point i said
to myself huh
i wonder if this was a you know a rare
mistake
because you could have made it more like
a delorean you know more sports courage
but on the other hand there is a very
large percentage of the public that
won't buy something that's too flashy
so i've got a feeling that if you want
to sell cars to regular people
you have to make them regular ordinary
i think we're too
uh into
you know into our lifestyle you know and
the way we present it
you can't take people who want to be
under the radar and give them a cool car
because they're not going to want it
so i've got a feeling that the delorean
will limit its audience to the you know
the high-end performance audience
because the average mom and dad just
want trunk space
and that ladies and gentlemen
is the conclusion of my prepared remarks
and i would like now a
medical rating if you're joining me late
uh i'm on third day of the covet still
testing positive just tested myself
before the live stream started
and so i'm infectious as a mofo but i
don't have any obvious symptoms that i
can feel so here's the question
could you detect my brain fog
go
locals are saying no
what do you say youtube could you detect
my brain fog
i'm seeing some yeses
seeing some yeses
how many of you think that the brain fog
detection could be
imaginary
a lot of yes's
a lot of yeses
yes you appear to be unreasonable
oh how many think that
is there anybody else who thinks that i
was more
strident or unreasonable today
kind of subjective
yeah all right would it make any
difference if you knew that
i'm also heavily under the influence of
marijuana
i got i got this new batch recently that
has the highest thc concentration i've
ever experienced 39
now if if anybody's familiar with the
field
uh 39 is shocking
i didn't even know that was even
possible frankly
30 is sort of will blow your socks off
you know if you're not really
experienced you don't want to go over 30
so i didn't know what i was going to get
at 39 but it's definitely different
yeah it definitely is a
it's quite a charge
yeah i don't think the fog is made up so
internally
i feel like
i may have some fog
but i can't tell yet in terms of my
performance
you don't look well
well i'm not
did i just tell you i've i've got a
terrible disease
apparently it's not that terrible
maybe coven blocks caffeine absorption
you know what
so jen says maybe coven blocks caffeine
absorption now i don't think that's true
we probably wouldn't have noticed it but
it feels exactly like that
it feels exactly like i didn't have
coffee
that's what it feels like
uh
so you're saying you're better isn't
necessarily true no my internal sense of
how i feel is completely better
i do have
i would call it maybe like a pressure or
something
on my brain
like things look different
for sure
yeah
anyway it's kind of fascinating i would
just encourage you not to believe any
story of somebody who had a miraculous
recovery from kovid because they took
anything
because apparently the symptoms just do
go away all at once when they go away
so you you're gonna blame or credit
whatever you were taking 10 minutes
before they went away
and you will be wrong
you always get a brain fog when you have
a cold or a fever
you know
honestly it's been 30 years or more
since i had anything that was like a bad
cold or a flu or anything like that
so i didn't even know what it felt like
to be sick
i literally forgotten what it felt like
to feel bad
i mean i guess that's the good news
all right i don't feel
depressed
because i've heard that some people have
symptoms of depression
so i don't feel that
and here's the weirdest part i think it
cured my
my
attention deficit disorder now i don't
have actual diagnosis of that
but there's a time of the day when i
just can't concentrate i just can't
concentrate
and
yesterday
i did an experiment
i said to myself i wonder if i could
just sit in the chair
just sit here
and be satisfied
do nothing else just sit here in the
chair
and this is something i've tried lots of
times before because i wanted to see if
you know maybe i could get into
meditating again
and i thought well i'll just try
to stay here and just be happy
i've never been able to do it
until yesterday
yesterday i had the weird experience
which i reproduced a number of times
during the day
of saying what if i just sit here
just sit here
and i would just sit there
and i was totally happy
i've never experienced that before
never
now i think yeah it was outside uh one
was outside
but not every time once was outside
um well i'm always high but that doesn't
make a difference because i've done the
experiment in every condition so i know
that doesn't make a difference
so my
my natural brain cycles
are running at
i don't know how to compare it to
anybody else's right because everybody
has their own subjective thing going on
but my
subjective experience of what happens in
my head
is that when i wake up in the morning my
clock speed of my brain is just right
and i can get a lot done i can
concentrate
by the middle of the day
there are so many things happening
simultaneously in my brain
that it's hard to do anything
there's just too much crashing in at the
same time
you walk outside if i open this door and
walk out
i will be met with three new variables
right somebody needs something i found
out a new thing the phone rings
yeah that sort of thing the dog throws
up on the ground
so
we're overwhelmed with all this
complexity
and yesterday i just sat there and
didn't think of any of it
now i assume less brain damage
i don't think that's like a cure
i think it's brain damage
but i'm hoping it's temporary
so i've i'm going to try doing uh some
cartooning today
the writing the writing's hard part
and i'm gonna see if anything i write
today is funny
that'll be the test
so we'll see
all right this ladies and gentlemen was
the best show you've ever seen in your
life i think you'd agree
and i'll keep you informed on my
recovery or non-recovery as it goes
and we'll talk to you
tomorrow
bye for now
you
