[Music]
hey everybody come on in
here good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
as you're pouring in here I know you are
you know if you'd like to take your
experience today which will be marvelous
up to levels that nobody can even
understand with their tiny human smooth
brains but if you'd like yours to go up
to levels that are absolutely July 4th
fireworks kind of spectacular all you
need for that is a cuper Mugger glass of
tankered chel a Jugger flask of vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the dope of
being here the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and happens now
go thank you
Paul always appreciate you if I don't
say it
enough well if you are watching the
Dilbert reborn comic that's only
available to subscribers on X or people
who subscribe to Scot ms. locals.com
where they get lots more
um Wally is using uh artificial
intelligence for his only health
care doesn't go well doesn't go
well anyway uh how many of you knew this
historical fact that John Adams
President John Adams and Thomas
Jefferson they both died on the same day
July 4th four hours
apart how many of you know that history
you've all been taught that that John
Adams and Thomas Jefferson died four
hours apart and there was a little story
about I guess when the first one
died uh when Jefferson died you know the
or the other one said oh the other one
still lives or something like
that so does that sound to you like a
story that is
real do you think they really died in
the same day
you were told that weren't you and
history records it if you researched it
history would agree do you think it
really
happened it's a little bit on the nose
isn't it little bit too on the nose a
little bit too
perfect if you heard a story like this
in 2024 would you believe it was
real giant
coincidence let let me you know since uh
we're watching the Democrats wake up
from their long sleep to find out that
the news about Biden had always been
fake and we're like whoa are you telling
me that all the people we trust could be
lying to us and and it could take years
to find
out yes yes all the people in charge
could be lying to you four
years now let me ask
again do you think that John Adams and
Thomas Jefferson
died on the same
day
really
really here's what I think they probably
died around the same
day but don't you think that if it was
around the same day there'd be a big
pressure to you make it sort of the same
day I think being within a few days of
the same day would be kind of a
coincidence but not nearly as remarkable
but I feel like maybe they might have
fudged it a little bit to make it sound
a little better to the public what do
you think I don't know I'm just saying
I'd bet against it I'd bet against it
being
real well let's play could have asked
Scott and saved a bunch of money in
science uh turns out there's a new study
amazingly you won't believe this but uh
less than two minutes of looking at
Water Outdoors such as a lake or an
ocean is enough to activate your
parasympathetic nervous system and lower
your blood pressure and heart
rate
um science let me talk to you for a
minute science the rest of you um just
going to take a moment I'm going to talk
to science
directly um
science you know there's a reason that
people vacation at the beach right
you know that Lakes are a recreational
destination what do you think that was
is it because going to the lake makes
you feel
bad is it because walking on the beach
in the sun with the water lapping up
against the beach is it because people
do that because it makes it feel bad no
no you could have saved a little bit of
time I've been to the beach has anybody
ever been on a beach
and did you instantly feel like oh this
is
relaxing but you didn't know if it was
relaxing until this study turns out that
what you were seeing with your own eyes
and feeling with your own feet and every
experience you had is exactly what you
thought it was it's I feel like we're in
the age of Biden's
brain where people where science can
tell us things that we all knew
forever and then we're supposed to act
surprised um no we knew Biden was gone
okay we knew going to the beach is
relaxing and we knew that relaxing is
good for all those things like high
blood pressure and such yeah we knew
that could have asked me save a little
money the University of
Cambridge uh has a hypothesis that has
some data behind it that oxytocin could
be a possible treatment for obesity and
postnatal
depression so let me see if I understand
this right so the drug or the let's say
the chemical the chemical that you have
in your body that sometimes you don't
have enough of is the thing that makes
you feel like you've got what you need
and you don't need anything
else that if you don't have enough of
that you're going to need like something
else to make you happy
well okay you may have heard me talk
about this for the last 20 years I call
it my pleasure unit
hypothesis that a human needs a certain
minimum amount of pleasure and if they
don't get it oh they're going to do
something to get it they'll break a law
they'll do illegal drugs they'll do
risky Behavior they'll have sex without
protection because
humans absolutely need some minimum
amount of pleasure or else they'll just
end their life lives it's like what's
the point of being here so oxytocin
certainly seems like it would be an
obvious treatment for obesity and
postnatal depression because depression
is because you don't have enough of the
right drugs so if you give give you the
right chemicals it seems like a good
guess that that would make you feel
better and
obesity if you have the drug that makes
you feel like you're connected and good
and everything is fine do you need to
eat as much
well you might love to eat but you're
not going to do it for emotional reasons
because your emotional reasons will be
solved by a chemical so I would say
that's in the should have asked Scott
category yes if oxytocin is something
you can actually give to somebody and it
will act just like you produced it
yourself yeah I I I could give you
another list of things it would cure
would you like the whole list it will
cure just about everything because it's
literally the only thing we we organize
our life around is to get more oxytocin
it's like the
thing all
right breit bar has a story that says
that uh that AI um Bots and other AI
garbages 42% of overall web
traffic wow um so eimi Technologies has
a
stat and so apparently the Bots are 40%
um just AI crawling around and grabbing
data and 65% of those Bots are
classified as
malicious
what 65% of the AI is already
malicious that's a lot um have you
noticed have any of you noticed that
YouTube has turned into what they call
the faceless channels where somebody
just gives an AI prompt and it creates a
whole YouTube video so apparently now
you could just um use whichever AIS I
forget and you could just say uh give me
a video about the fall of
Rome and then it just makes it there
just won't any real people in it'll be
sort of
cartoony and so people quickly figured
out that they could make these and make
a fortune but what it did was it sort of
ruined
YouTube because now YouTube is just all
these faceless things that I could just
ask chat
GPT I don't really need
YouTube if it's the same thing that I
can just ask chat gbt and they'll just
talk me through it because once you take
out the people I don't much need to look
at the pictures it becomes almost an
audio product after that so in fact
that's what I do I use chat GPT app and
I just ask at the same things I would
have looked for on YouTube so instead of
looking for you know a pre-made YouTube
video I just say hey tell me about this
or that and it gives me basically a
YouTube without the
video um but I think that porn is
largely going to be a dead industry on
the internet because
um I think AI will replace all the human
women the human women will move to um
you know only fans the attractive ones
and that will leave unattractive women
in porn plus
AI I I think the future is that that
porn will just go
away because it'll it'll all be just
buried with bad AI stuff and just
looking for it will be a pain and then
the attractive women have already left
the industry I think that's what it
looks
like so I think the porn industry is
dead actually um there's something you
never thought did you ever think the
porn industry would just
die I think it's already dead I I I
think that
literally it's just it's just overweight
ugly people in porn now it's it's
dead all right so you've been hearing
about this project 25 the Heritage
Foundation puts out this real big
document of things that they wish would
happen if a conservative comes to power
or conservatives come to power and it
involves you know every major agency and
how they would be eliminated or changed
and it there's a list of conservatives
who ready to go for different
jobs uh however this is called by the
Democrats a blueprint for fascism it's a
blueprint for
fascism so I think that's what Jane
Fonda says and it would do things like
uh get rid of the EPA and the Department
of
Education you dismantle the government
now here's my
question I don't know too much about
what the word fascism means but As Trump
once famously said I don't think you
know what it means either well sort of
paraphrasing um but is reducing the size
of your own government
fascism is that what that's called when
you reduce regulations in other words
you have less control as a government
over the people so you're returning
freedom to the people in the sense of
getting rid of burdensome regulations as
they would see it
burdensome how in the world do you call
that
fascism I was pretty sure that was the
opposite now have you seen any situation
in which the news or people in it would
tell you something that's clearly the
opposite of what it
is Joe Biden's sharpest
attack just to pick
one um president Trump is colluding with
Russia
51 uh people tell you the laptop is
Russia disinformation or has all the
earmarks of it yeah we're pretty used to
the news and the famous people in the
news telling us the opposite of what is
obvious and I think that might be
new would you agree that it used to be
that people would say stuff like well
I've got a I got a secret source that
said something and you say to yourself
well probably not true but you know I
don't see anything that would counter it
it's just something that's true or not
and you can't tell but there's nothing
saying it's not true it's just an
unknown we've gone from unknowns to
things you know for sure are true that
the people who should be telling you the
truth are telling you you're not seeing
you know Jake Tapper was apparently
saying the same thing that we're being
asked to deny what we see obviously
right in front of us now he was talking
about denying that Biden has a little
cognitive difficulties we all saw it and
yet part of the part of the government
and part of the um media is trying to
tell us that they couldn't see
it
really
really no you could see
it and now according to Red State the
Biden campaign uh there's a Biden
campaign official who's accusing the
media of election
interference uh because the way they're
covering Biden in the
debate
wow so they're
worried just hold this in your head
there's a Biden
official campaign official who is
willing to say
publicly that correct news which is that
Biden is
infirmed correct news is election
interference accurate news is is
election
interference now I could see how it
would be but you would have to have been
in a coma for a very long time to think
this is the point you want to make in
public so I guess the fake news isn't
working for them the way it used
to all right here's another shocking
fact allegedly according to the Daily
Mail uh Venezuela had an epic drop in
Murder so the murder rate in Venezuela
just went through the floor not really
it's a 22e low down 25% or something um
and of course the suggestion there is
that the Venezuelan murderers and the
repeat criminals have been uh released
from jail and sent to America or if they
weren't in jail they just came to
America and that the reason that the
crime is low in Venezuela compared to
what it was um is because the criminals
came to America
does that sound
true does that sound
true or does it
sound a little bit too on the
nose it's kind of clean isn't it it's a
very clean story well we're
anti-immigration and now Venezuela their
crime rate is gone down so I guess that
means all the criminals came to the
United States am I right let me say let
me be as clear as I can that might be
exactly what's
happening I I I cannot disprove that
claim nor is it ridiculous on its
surface because we know lots of people
are coming if you were a criminal maybe
it's pretty good way to get a clean
start so it's perfectly possible that
that's exactly what's
happening but have you ever seen any
government data from the United
States such as California's job reports
that we found out today have been
completely fake such as the major
revisions of everything such as the
crime statistics that we report report
in the United States which are clearly
fudged why would you trust Venezuela to
have accurate crime
data of all the things that that
Venezuela is likely to do
right you think the crime data is in
that list you don't you don't think that
maybe the government just wants you to
think the government of Venezuela you
don't think that maybe they just want
you to think that they did a good job
and crime went
down do you think that they even have
good reporting in Venezuela or do you
think it's more likely that somebody
stopped
reporting remember it's like a failed
state but you think their date is good
it's a failed state with accurate data
is that what you think they get a
dictator but they get accurate data and
if failed
State there isn't really a big chance
that their data is
correct you get that right the odds of
Venezuela's data being correct is close
to
zero now but I have to be I have to be
specific that doesn't mean it's not
true it mean it might be true that
there's a whole bunch of criminals that
used to be there that moved to America I
would assume some have I mean that you
you could say with some certainty
some number of criminals from Venezuela
have made it to America I just don't
know if that's behind the drop in the
crime statistics so here's a little test
for
you if you're going to mock the idiots
just be careful what you're believing
because this was a little bit too on the
nose for me I'm not going to buy this
one could be I I can't debunk it but no
no far more likely the numbers are wrong
all right or far more likely that it's
just there's some kind of natural thing
that's happening that just reduced the
uh reduce the
rate um let's see remember the theory
that Obama was really the one in control
of Biden and the Biden was never
independent it was always a you know
Obama was behind the scenes and I I
entertained that theory as
well um but it sort of conflicted with
other theories you know the other theory
that the CIA is in charge or that the uh
the uh defense industrial you know
industry is in charge but really that's
also the
CIA or uh I don't know there's some
secret advisor who's really in charge so
we had lots of rumors of who's really in
charge but I think you can rule out
Obama was in charge of of Biden because
the reporting is that Obama is not too
pleased with Biden staying in the race
and if Obama had all that
power Biden would already be out of the
race so the evidence suggests that
whatever Obama's Obama's influence was
it wasn't as much as Obama wanted
because I think he's complained about
you know Biden before as as if he
doesn't have any control he complained
and now it looks like he certainly
doesn't have control over whether Biden
bows out now it could also be that there
are no real options we're just
pretending there are options and there
aren't but I feel like you can rule that
out now I was surprised to see that
somebody smart agreed with
me or or even more rare uh I agreed with
somebody smart because Mike Ben has
pointed out that maybe it was always the
Biden family that the were the ones that
were sort of connected to the uh let's
say the intelligence community
maybe the fact that the bidens were all
over Ukraine tells you that the bidens
were the ones closest to the real power
and maybe that's why Obama had to pick
Biden as his vice president it could be
that Biden was the the cia's pick to
make sure that you know Obama didn't get
too far off off of the path maybe I mean
just speculating here or it could be
that the
CIA liked both of them could be that but
um so Benz is is suggesting that you
know the Biden family in the CIA might
have had a closer connection and that
even even now um there was a ex head of
the intelligence Community who saying
that as long as the head of the CIA is
happy with Biden we're in good shape
because you know he has good
advisors so the idea is that the country
is not in trouble because there are real
adults running the important stuff like
the CIA and if the CIA the head is okay
with
Biden well then there's not really much
of a
problem except that sort of gives away
the game doesn't
it could they be more obvious that the
CIA is running
Biden I mean how am I supposed to take
that how in the world would the CIA
think that a degraded you know mentally
degraded president is a good
idea under What scenario is that a good
idea the only scenario I could think of
is he didn't matter in the first
place it seems pretty obvious that the
person who would know who matters the
head of the CIA if they're okay with
this and apparently they are that really
suggest that it's been a while since
Biden had much real influence he might
have just been caretaker for the office
and and the office might be just a
subsidiary of the
CIA so he's just a figurehead could be
that's one hypothesis that does not seem
to be ruled down at this
point all right um did you know this is
another Mike Ben's point out that KL
Harris was on the Senate intelligence
committee do you remember that somehow I
didn't remember that but she was on the
Senate and intelligence committee guess
what the Senate intelligence committee
does it oversees the
CIA so in Congress there's a group that
oversees the
CIA sort of like a regulator you might
say what would you expect to happen of
somebody regulating the
CIA well on day one maybe a little bit
of
regulating what happens 10 years later
well on paper there's only one way it
goes on paper if you said all right
there's a there's a group of elected
officials and it's their job to Monitor
and sort of be the boss in a sense of
the
CIA now you go out 10 years what
happened you all know what would happen
that the the the committee That was
supposed to be regulating so to speak
would be
captured just like every other
regulator because if The Regulators have
less power or money or they're less
scary than what they're regulating over
time the one the one getting regulated
will be in charge it's true with
everything we've ever seen you know our
medical situation it looks like the FDA
and the other organizations are just
owned by the people with the
money so does it seem weird to
you that Harris would be on the Senate
intelligence committee which one assumes
by now should be owned by the CIA which
would make Harris an acceptable CIA
candidate if any of this is true by the
way I'm just in speculative territory
here we have to guess on a lot of stuff
because we don't know what the real
government we actually we literally
don't know what our government is is
that fair is it fair to say that as of
today if I had to describe who's in
charge of the government I literally
couldn't do it not with confidence so
we're left to speculate who's actually
in charge and in what situations is who
in charge so I'm just speculating
because I don't know who's in charge but
it on
paper if if if there's any kind of chaos
on paper these Spooks should end up in
charge because they have the ability the
power the right skills they have the
right
access on paper they should always end
up in charge there shouldn't be any
other possibility and by the way if the
CIA was so lame that they couldn't uh
completely control the Senate
intelligence
committee they couldn't do anything else
either that would be like the easiest
thing they'd ever did you know they're
out there overthrowing countries like
crazy you don't think they could get a
lot of control over who the Senate
intelligence committee picks to be in
the committee of course they can Chuck
Schumer said so if you cross the
intelligence Community they have a what
do you say a thousand ways from Sunday
to get back at
you even you know even the majority or
was he minority leader then um even they
say directly that's a very direct
statement that they're in charge if if
the elected officials are literally
afraid of them and that's what Schumer
said he said that Trump should be afraid
of them which suggests that Schumer
himself is afraid of them that's who's
in charge the person you're afraid of I
mean that's a pretty clear signal and I
think KL Harris is becoming a clear
signal as
well all right design is Destiny so if
there's somebody regulating the CIA the
CIA will eventually own them that's
that's
guaranteed well now we have 25 members
of the house that are Democrats who are
preparing to call for uh Biden to step
down 25 of them well 25 is not that many
you know given the total number in
Congress 25 is not a lot but it's more
than one one one has so far
um but it's only the ones in competitive
races so the ones who are safe in their
reelection they're just going with the
flow because they don't need to do
anything but the uh the ones who are in
trouble trouble you know the ones who
are actually going to lose their jobs
are willing to say Biden is uh not the
guy now have I ever mentioned that
sometimes you can predict the future by
a little trick that I made up all by
myself you've never heard of it it's
called follow the money now of course
it's a famous famous thing and follow
the money every time you see it working
you should say to yourself there it goes
again
keeps working because if you can't
predict the future by following the
money well you shouldn't be doing any
predicting because that's the easy one
the easy one is follow the money so
you've got a bunch of you know maybe
25ish Democrats who feel like they'll
lose their job and their money you know
nobody wants to go look for a new job
so they would be the ones who would turn
on Biden and suddenly they can see all
of his
infirmities but the people who have no
money on the line and have safe jobs
they they think he's
fine so could there be a clearer example
that the Democrats are not even trying
to represent the public oh big
surprise the ones who are going to lose
money if Biden stays in because he'll
ruin the whole down vote situation the
ones who will lose money are willing to
say he's he'll go and the ones who won't
lose money are willing to just let it
go so there's your your honest democrats
for you no but I'm sure it would work
the same way with Republicans by the way
it wouldn't be any different the
Republicans would follow the money
because everybody does the reason it
works is that nobody's
exempt you know if some big part of the
country didn't follow the money reliably
then it wouldn't be such an easy way to
to predict what's going to happen but
they do everybody religious people
non-religious it doesn't matter they all
follow the money sometimes they have
excuses they'll say follow the money oh
yeah yeah I guess
coincidentally that uh those big old
Noble reasons that I gave you I guess
you're right I I hadn't even noticed but
it is compatible with my own Financial
benefit huh I didn't didn't really even
notice it when I was doing my detailed
analysis and making my mind up but
you're right you know now that you
mentioned it I would make more money
with this opinion huh yeah it's a big
coincidence well according to Colin rug
and some other people reporting that in
the betting markets uh Harris has
already overtaken Joe Biden so if you're
were going to place a bet the odds are
that Trump is I don't know up close to
60% odds of winning and against
everybody else and uh
Harris is now you know somewhere in that
15% range barely squeaking out Biden
some of the betting polls are different
so it's not it's not every
poll but
uh I'm so mad
because the easiest money I ever could
have
made would be betting that Kell Harris
would be the you know the candidate but
here's why it's a little bit tricky
they're not really giving us a Biden or
Kam Harris option you think they are
because your brain is still in the
normal world in the normal world if you
had a the top of the ticket was clearly
mentally incapable and everybody could
say it in a normal world you would
replace that person with somebody who is
at least not mentally
deranged so that would suggest well it's
definitely you know kamla or somebody
but you know not to be Biden that's the
normal world you don't live in that
world this is not the normal World let
me tell you the most likely outcome
doesn't mean it'll happen but here's the
most likely outcome and Biden's uh the
rate of his failing health will be the
determinant Biden's not going to drop
out unless he gets a lot worse fast and
he might be so worse that he can't make
the decision to drop out because he's
not thinking right so we may be past the
point where he is coherent enough to
even know he should drop out so we might
be
stuck but here's the thing was there
really some chance that anybody but K
Harris was going to be considered and
the answer is if you've been alive for
the last 5 years and you weren't in a
coma you know that they could not could
not skip over KLA Harris because she's
black and female and by the way there's
a
California uh California politician who
says it directly on video there's no way
you're going to skip over the black
woman because you're going to lose Black
Women Voters and then you're dead you
can't win so the threat is there it's
direct and it's public you can't do it
and of course they know they can't do it
they are they are the Dei party they
can't ignore Dei just because it got
inconvenient that would blow the whole
whole the game so they're stuck with her
but here's where I think many of you
might be wrong especially the Betty
markets I don't think she's going to be
officially at the top of the ticket on
Election Day I think they're going to
run the Schrodinger's
candidate now you remember Schrodinger's
cat famous mental experiment where you
put a cat in a sealed box and there's
some radioactive decay and if it goes a
certain way the and you can't tell
because it'd be a randomized process the
cat would be dead because it would
release a poison and if it went if the
radioactive decay went a different way
the poison would not be released and
when you opened the box the cat would be
alive so and then the the weird physics
of it which you could debate is that
until you see the cat it is neither
alive nor dead is in a super position or
or the it's only in a state of potential
potentially alive potentially dead and
you don't know until you open the box
because according to physics things
don't solidify until they're observed or
or measured somehow
so here's what the uh Biden Harris team
appears to be doing and this is my
prediction Biden will still be top of
the ticket on Election Day no matter how
degraded he is so long as he can still
talk if he's on machines it might be
different but I think they're going to
say you know what here's the proposition
here's my prediction Democrats will
eventually settle on the following
message you're voting for kamla either
way that's it that's the message we're
going to run Joe Biden at the top but we
all agree that you know he's going to
step down as soon as he gets
elected so whether kamla goes to the top
place place and runs or she stays as
vice president and runs in both cases
you're voting for kamla but here's the
beauty of it the psychological Beauty
and and
remember we're in stupid world so what I
tell you next you're going to say but
Scott that's so illogical right right it
is and it's what they're going to think
and do something completely illogical
and very predictable and it looks like
this they're going to run the
Schrodinger's
candidate they're going to say if you
like Biden vote for
Biden you're going to get KL Harris but
if you don't want to vote for KL Harris
you don't have to because Biden's right
there vote for Biden but suppose you
want to not vote for Biden because you
could see that would be a disaster what
do you do
then you vote for KLA
Harris by voting for Biden
because in both cases you get KLA Harris
it's
just well there's really only one
situation you're going to get conell
Harris because there's no way that Joe
would get elected and continue serving
we all know that right so we don't know
if it's the day after the election the
day after
inauguration six months in but nobody
nobody thinks that if Biden got elected
that you still the president in six
months nobody thinks that it'd be 25th
amendment for sure
but so there's my prediction so if I
were to go to the Bing markets and say
KL Harris is going to be the candidate I
could be right and lose the
bet you see the problem because if if
they simply run as the same package that
they said they were because all the
paperwork is done and they're on the
ballots if they simply just do what they
say they're going to do that's really
Comm Harris running there's no way
around that there no smart person would
disagree with that statement that at
this point if it's Biden at the top of
the ticket it's it's a Comm Harris race
so here's the thing that
you you uh weekend speculators are
missing they don't have to do
anything no change is necessary to get
everything they want they'll leave Biden
in for everybody wants to vote for him
but really is kamla and everybody who
wanted kamla to be at the top of the
ticket would say you know what I guess
it is a little late for that but we'll
just take it the other way you know
we'll just wait 6 months which would be
quite reasonable just wait six months so
then everybody in the Democratic party
gets
everything the stupid way the stupid way
by running the guy with no brain but
telling you that you can have it either
way you could have a Biden or you could
have a kamla which is really just KLA
but if you like Biden why don't you vote
for Biden he did a great job why don't
you reward him reward him with a vote
for Biden but don't worry because it's
just couple it's Schrodinger's candidate
they're really going to run both of them
and one is dead and one is alive just
like the
cat it's kind of fascinating but here's
the thing if you think it's not going to
be kamla either as the second part of
the ticket or the
top every path is
kamla it's all CA all the way it never
was anything else or any other
possibility there was never a
possibility of Michelle Obama never and
she just confirmed that it's not in her
soul and let me tell you how to read um
an honest versus an a dishonest answer
here would be a a potentially dishonest
answer if Michelle Obama said I have to
be honest I haven't even thought about
it well that would leave the door open
wouldn't it all you have to do is think
about it or how about if she said Joe
Biden is the nominee that is the end of
it well that would be leaving the door
open a little bit wouldn't it it would
how
about um you know I don't think I could
win oh that would be leaving the door
open a little bit how about um you know
I I haven't had an interest in
politics no but you could you could get
interested to save the country so there
are a Thousand Ways she could have said
that she's not
interested that you would say hm the way
you said it though the way you said it
makes me think you might
be but she didn't do any of the thousand
ways that would leave the door open she
said you have to have it in your soul to
run for office I do not have it in my
soul it's not going to happen that
ladies and gentlemen is 100 per
proof she's not going to run you do not
say it's not in my soul unless you're
really really not going to run because
you don't want anybody to ask you later
well what about that whole soul thing
you're running but I'm not sure you're
into
it she's basically poisoned her own
candidacy by saying my soul isn't into
it you can't take that back now Biden
said he wasn't ready you know because he
had a death in the family or something
not ready is saying that you will be
ready she's not saying later I'll have a
soul for it she's saying I don't have
the soul for it and there's no way you
get elected once you said you don't have
the soul for the job that is a poison
pill that she gave to herself right in
front of you hey hey morons do you see
this giant poison pill it's called it's
not my soul I'm going to take this right
in front of you will you please shut up
stop saying I might be president shut up
watch me eat that only
it's like what what can she do to
convince you no there was never any
chance she would be president or run for
it all
right uh what about those maralago boxes
if you're not following uh lawyer Jeff
Clark um for all of the law fair stuff
about Trump you're missing a lot of
great takes but but uh so Jeff Clark
look for him and follow him on X and he
says in a post today it's now Dawning on
the left that the argument I've long
been
making uh regarding the moral Lago
documents case is correct that whatever
else is true Trump Declassified the
documents and then he puts it in
asterisk by course of
Conduct in other words the mere Act of
saying put these in the boxes and send
them to Mar Lago by any reasonable
person's judgment would be a
declassification because there was no
formal process that he had to follow so
the fact that he was sloppy with the
sort of informal process would be
irrelevant because he's the president so
if he if he acts in every way as though
documents are being disass Declassified
and certainly packing them up and
sending them outside of the White House
and outside of a secure environment
would be the clearest possible
indication that he doesn't expect them
to be CL classified now whether he said
it or not I think you have to give him
the benefit of a doubt and it wouldn't
matter what president it was I'd say the
same thing I think on that gray stuff
you got to give them the benefit of it
that you just can't run the presidency
if every little gray area you know slows
them
down so um so Jeff Clark says turns out
that now it's been confirmed that Trump
has immunity for official acts that's
the Supreme K case uh that taking the
documents with him to maralago means no
criminal liability can attach because it
was an official act that by his actions
he Declassified the
documents seems right to be now this by
the way was
um exactly my take from the beginning
that he didn't have to say the words
because there was no process no
guaranteed process there was you know an
informal one there was a traditional one
but not one that he had to
follow all right um CNN's getting heat
for what the left left thinks is CNN
trying to take Biden out of the race so
they think that they they bias the
debate they didn't they think that the
CNN people are uh somehow Pro Trump or
at least not anti-trump
enough I don't see it but I I guess if
they're not getting what they want the
MSNBC people um they don't like it so
they don't like
CNN all right let's see what
else
um so there's a there's a
video that's viral of uh just so you can
visualize it there's a young black man
who's on some kind of a zoom call with a
young black woman and he's asking her
who said the following uh quotes
and he gives a bunch of quotes that are
all Joe Biden quotes every one of the
quotes is Joe Biden and the young black
woman says oh that's Trump oh that was
definitely Trump and she says Trump for
everyone now these are the uh historical
comments that Biden has made the sound
some people say
racist if the if the shoe were reversed
I would probably say he wasn't but
that's what they're saying so apparently
the actual words of Biden when heard out
a context makes a young black woman say
oh that's got to be Trump because that's
racist as hell and when she was told
that every one of those comments came
from Biden and none of them came from
Trump she was instantly
flipped to what the hell is going on
here now I don't know if she would I
don't that doesn't mean she's Pro Trump
but everything she thought about Biden
versus Trump she suddenly realized was
wrong it was fascinating and I love to
see how many times you could reproduce
that because I've seen that same thing
on Street interviews before where you
just give the quotes of Biden and
everybody thinks it's Trump and they the
young people especially they all think
it sounds super racist because they're
all woke and uh it blows their mind when
they find out they're wrong blows their
mind it's fun to watch i' like to see
more of
it all right
um as you know Biden's new attack on uh
Trump is that Trump is a
liar now we've all watched Trump and we
know that the fact Checkers get
exhausted when he gives a rally we know
that it's all baked in but most of us
have come to the understanding that he
he uh lies like a salesperson in other
words he's a productive liar in other
words he's lying for your benefit
because we all want to get a deal you
know if he says my economy was way
better last year than you
remember well you could call it a lie or
you could say he's trying to get elected
because he would be the best one to help
you with the economy that would be a
productive lie you know B bending the
truth hyperbole little exaggeration of
what he accomplished maybe even some
madeup
stuff and if he get
elected he would be very transparent
because presidents are and we would see
if he's doing things for us and if it
was like the first four years you'd
probably like a lot of the stuff he
did so um here's my question if Biden is
saying that Trump is a big old liar and
that's why you should not vote for him I
was trying to think and this is not a
rhetorical question it'll sound like a
it'll sound like I know the answer I
don't know the answer but I was trying
to think of anything that Biden has said
of
substance that's true I couldn't think
of anything
now that doesn't mean that he hasn't
said a true thing of importance I just
know I couldn't think of one I couldn't
think of anything nothing every every
topic I thought of the way he talks
about it is a lie so he either has a
hoax or he has wrong facts or or he's
you know leaving something out or he's
just wildly making something up I mean
the think about the categories uh we
know all of his personal stories are
complete we know his complaints
about Trump are 100% hoaxes every single
complaint about Trump is based on a hoax
no
exceptions all of his complaints are
based on a weird interpretation of
reality or
hoax and and then he you know of course
he presents his record in a misleading
way which they all do they all do so he
he's lying about his personal anecdotes
he's lying 100% about Trump using hoaxes
he lies about his record they all do and
he lied about his health his mental
health what's
left this is not a rhetorical question
because I don't want to be hanging out
there if there are examples to disprove
me so I need you to disprove me before
somebody who doesn't like me disproves
me please tell me anything he said of
substance you know something about the
campaign what has Biden said of
substance that was also true I couldn't
think of a single thing can
you well he this week what did he say
this week
um that he had a
cold and then he then he said that he
was tired from traveling even though he
had like a week to get get over it he
was still tired from traveling uh he
said that Trump got dictator powers from
the Supreme Court none of those things
are
true 100% of everything he said in the
last few days was false everything I
think everything he said probably
everything at the debate was a lie or an
a
context Am I Wrong can can somebody tell
me if there's anything of
substance he says at all at all anything
that isn't misleading intentionally an a
context or just a flat out lie I can't
think think of a thing not a single
thing so Joy Reed is uh
hilarious um
I'm try something here I'm see if I can
share my screen I may disappear we'll
see what
happens let's
see start my screen
sharing this will be interesting to see
if I can pull it off
hey look at that technology it's
working now that's Joy
Reed uh let me see if I
can try to make that
bigger and tell Joe Biden what to do and
Dr Joe Biden and apparently even Hunter
telling him what to
do so let me tell you what this show is
going to do we are going to pay all of
that the same amount of attention the
same amount of attention will go to
that all
right I'm not sure if I Disappeared
there or not because I was skipping back
and forth but watch Joy Reed and see if
you get the same Vibe I do which is a a
mental health
crisis now I'm not saying that strictly
for political reasons because you know I
don't like her team honestly it comes
comes across a severe mental illness
even one eye looks like it's not open
like one of her eyes is like you know
going crazy like like your brain is not
firing right and the things that she
says are so wildly ridiculous that it
just looks like mental health and then
you know a minute later um Rachel mad
will come on and she just screams bad
mental health which she's admitted by
the way she has a a long-term mental
health problem which is all over her
face and I I feel bad for both of them
so if it sounds like I'm just being mean
that's not my intention I actually have
empathy for them they look like they're
having a crisis and it's they're acting
it out in their jobs unfortunately it's
affecting us
so when and then uh Jane Fondo was in
some event in which he was talking about
Trump and she just seemed bash she had
crazy I think we've got to stop ignoring
the
the problem is mental health you tell me
that all of the hosts of MMS of MSNBC
are not seeing
therapists seriously do you think Joy
Reid is not seeing a
therapist do you think ra Rachel madow
is not seeing a
therapist do you think the others are
not seeing
therapists I would guess every one of
them is I don't know I mean I'll be
speculating but they they they don't
don't just
have um a different
opinion here's the
difference I've watched uh Jake Tapper
you know forever and often disagreeing
with his takes have I ever thought he
had a mental
illness no not once not once I I don't
know you know exactly what he's thinking
nobody knows what anybody's thinking but
he doesn't look mentally ill and and if
you were to look at you know let's say
Wolf Blitzer or you know any of the andn
gang none of them look mentally
ill even though I've often you know
greatly disagreed with their takes they
look like they believe
them um you know at least in a non-crazy
way and the bifurcation of the media on
the left into CNN which I would call a a
normal dissenting voice meaning that
they're not always going to agree with
the administration
sometimes they might uh versus the ones
that just are bad
crazy and I I think it's still a male
female thing I think the women um have
scared themselves well not themselves I
would say that the Democrats have
gaslighted themselves to the point where
the people with the weakest Minds among
the Democrats believe the gaslighting
because they don't get the real news and
they're in a panic and I think Republic
ANS are safer because they recognize it
for what it is which is some kind of
weird brainwashing propaganda thing that
seems to affect the people doing it and
not the people that trying to do it
too well I mean the Democrats are
unified but Republicans don't look at
any of this stuff and think it's real we
literally I watch NBC
MSNBC for entertainment because I just
can't believe it it's just weird and
wacky now do you think that they have
the same view when they watch Fox News I
don't think so I think they think the
Fox News people are lying or
evil um but not they're not
crazy I don't think
so let's see uh Rachel madow had Stormy
Daniels on
yesterday
yesterday do you think Stormy Daniels is
a relevant guest to have on in our
current situation I can't think of
anything that would be less useful to
the country than to hear a little bit
more from
stormy now what's that I mean that just
again that just looks like mental
illness instead of even somebody doing
their job that doesn't even seem like
serving the customers at
all
um and what what is it that
uh oh well okay this is what Joy Reed
said uh we begin tonight with reality
which is sinking in I'm not going to gas
light you you saw it I saw it everyone
who frantically texted me saw it now
she's talking about Biden's bad
performance so she says I'm not going to
Gaslight
you why would she say
that why why would it seem necessary to
say I'm not going to Gaslight
you I've never said that in my life do
you know why because it's not in my
mental model that one of the things I
might ever do is Gaslight you here
here's another thing I've never had to
say hey Bob don't worry I'm not going to
get a chainsaw and cut you in
half do you know why because we would
both know that would not be in the set
of possible
options don't worry I'm not going to
Flap my wings and fly
away nope not one of the
options the fact that she said I'm not
going to do it suggest strongly that she
has done it and knew it was an option
so yeah this is my hypnotist filter the
hypnotist filter says there are no
accidents in ch in the choice of words
and indeed choice of words is what
hypnosis is it's knowing that some words
are more active than others that's a
simplification but basically is that and
when I see somebody choose those words
which are very unusual choice of words
what is the last sometime somebody said
to you I'm not going to gasly you when
the topic was something you saw with
with your own
eyes yeah yeah we all saw with our own
eyes so I'm not going to tell you you
didn't see it with your own eyes why is
that even a
topic unless she knows she does it
sometimes that's my speculation and then
she
says it is straight up fascism if you're
to combine a trump
autocracy a fully Christian nationalist
Republican party in control of both
houses in Congress and the current
Supreme Court majority wow Katie Bar the
Door and unleash the devil because we
would be finished as a
democracy I don't even know where to
start with that bunch of crazy
should I start with we haven't been a
democracy ever we're Republic that's too
obvious should I start with uh
presidential autocracy yeah the autocrat
is who her her president wants to put in
jail for law fair how do you ignore
that and the other gu said
autograph so that's the uh bat
crazy woman update um I would say that
what we're seeing is not politics
anymore the the whole Biden situation
it's very divorced from what I'd call
politics uh now it's about Democrats who
have poisoned the minds of other
Democrats the real issue here is what
Democrats did to
themselves to pretend that this is now
about Democrats versus republic
Republicans that's not exactly the top
line I mean that's happening too but the
top line is there's this massive mental
illness that was caused by democrats
poisoning their own minds with non-stop
hoaxes on paper you were going to end up
here suppose I told you one of the
political parties is going to completely
forget about even trying to be honest
and just do hoaxes all the
time what would you predict would be the
outcome of that well you would predict
that the people who watch hoaxes all day
long and then inevitably they find out
that they're in a hoax hoax
ocracy that they get all kinds of mental
disabilities from that that's what
happens but you could have predicted
that from the
setup here we are here's another
prediction you know I always talk about
systems being better than goals and
sometimes I say Democrats like goals and
Republicans like systems and that more
than any other reason is why I um I'm a
registered Democrat but I prefer
Republicans I prefer them because
they're systems
based religion is a system Christianity
is a system working hard and staying in
a jail is a system going to jail
learning a skill getting a family making
sure that you get married young have
some kids that's a
system and they would they even talk
about it that way you know the family
unit is a good system uh you know having
a religion it's good system then you
know they don't use the word system but
they do talk about institutions and
things that have worked before systems
what do the uh Republic what do the
Democrats say got to make everything
diverse well how you going to do it well
we'll just make unqualified people get
hired that's not really a system
that's more like you start with the end
point and you just hammer it in you know
you're missing the whole buildup to it
the the useful part
so I would say that if you if you had
predicted what would happen if the
Democrats go Hog Wild with
Dei and then you combine that with a
thoroughly fake news
industry where would you end up if
that's all you knew all you knew is they
were going to go big on Dei without a
system to get there
and that the media would be lying about
everything right here you would be right
here you would be in a place where the
country is doubting reality
itself all right we'll get rid
of full screen
Joy
um all right so if you want to break the
brains of the Democrats
completely try telling them that Trump
is not a felon he's not a convicted
felon and it's unlikely he'll ever be
one do you think any Democrats know that
it's true he's not a felon because the
judge has not you know done whatever is
the official thing the judge has to do
so it's not official until it's entered
to the record so they've been calling
him a convicted felon and he's not now
to their credit there were saying it
because it was just a matter of you know
some
paperwork not
anymore it's not a matter of some
paperwork now now I'd bet against it I'd
bet against it because he's got that
ruling that you know he's got some
immunity that uh may require redo or a
throwing out of the case but at the very
least it would push it till Trump is
President and then all bets are
off
so it's entirely possible I would say
even likely that Trump will never be a
felon and that's a reality that the the
Democrats have been living in the
reality that they successfully lawed him
they turned him into a
felon and it never happened it never
happened how are they going to handle
that imagine being at this point with
what they're finding out about their
media lying to them imagine finding out
for the first time well you know he's
not a felon
technically and the odds of him becoming
one just went really small are you aware
of that they're not going to like
it uh I saw a funny comment from uh just
a user on X named John
ecall and uh he wrote this uh one
sentence that made me laugh he goes man
journalists are going to be so surprised
when they hear about all of Joe's Shady
business
dealings do we have another round of
this where the Democrats suddenly find
out that Joe Biden has some shady
connections to money from other
countries are they going to say hey if
we get a scoop for you we think some of
Hunter's money from China and Ukraine
may have ended up in Joe Biden's pockets
I know I know hard to believe well
here's the good news uh President Biden
says grocery costs are too high for
families across the country and we have
a plan to tackle
them it's good he wasn't specific about
the plan but I do have some behind the
curtain um a little
special I guess you could call it
breaking news and maybe a an exclusive
really an exclusive I do know Joe
Biden's plan for making your groceries
cost
less uh it's something called
OIC uh and you get it in a shot and the
shots will be
mandatory what now why are you
laughing no that's a good plan what did
you miss a whole
pandemic if there's something that can
save your health and it's happening like
a you know all over the country the
government can make you get a shot
now what do you what would you call
obesity what what would kill more people
the pandemic or or
obesity well you know the answer obesity
will be far more deadly than the
pandemic now if the pandemic cause them
to force you to get shots you know to go
to school and work and travel and stuff
why would they do the same thing for um
grocery
prices right you you could cut your
grocery prices in half by eating less so
I think he's going to reduce the demand
for groceries by giving a mandatory OIC
shots because why
not let me put it in a different way if
the president sat down in front of you
and said what was your reasoning for
making these uh the covid shots
mandatory and he would say something
like well Co was a deadly thing and uh
we had to make sure I was protecting the
country and if I hadn't people would
have died now you you could argue about
the reality of that but that would be
their case their argument for why they
made it mandatory for let's say flying
and stuff like that was that it was a
big Health
crisis and there was a treatment the
shot and so the government thought it
should make it somewhat mandatory at
least they would pressure you to get
it how is is that different from
obesity find me any way that that's
different obesity is more dangerous
there is a shot you can take that has
some side effects it's not it's not
risk-free but it's been
tested why not uh make uh 300 million
Doses and just start giving that stuff
to every overweight person in the
country can you imagine how much better
our health would be if we had mandatory
oing shots
no I'm not in favor of it in case this
gets taken out of comp this will be
taken out of context of course but tell
me what's the
difference see that's the interesting
thing there isn't
any there
isn't all
right
um so it looks like MSNBC is going to
Pivot their hoaxes from Biden is sharp
to uh the January 6 zombie hoax o it's a
zombie hoax
because as obviously not true as it is
can't
die um and they're going to call it the
big lie that the election was rigged the
big lie what would be a bigger lie than
the president does not have
dementia that's about pretty big I call
that pretty
big anyway the fact that they've P
pivoted to um calling the idea that the
election was rigged a big lie why would
they do
that remember we're we're going to do
the hypnotist test again about the
choice of
words if you just wanted to say the
election was not
rigged why do you need to brand it why
don't you just say there's no evidence
you it wasn't rigged it was clean had a
good election but
no they call it the big lie so it sounds
nazil likee right
that's what the big lie refers to it's a
Nazi reference so so they're acting like
Nazis uh well you could say it's the
opposite let's not argue with they're
Nazis uh rather let's say why would they
say that the election rigging is the big
lie why do they have to Brand
it what's The Branding telling
you it's telling me that they know it
was
rigged that's what it tells me to to me
that's a strong signal that they're
completely aware it was fake because if
they thought it was real they'd say look
you idiots show us some evidence or just
shut
up elections are fine you wouldn't go so
far as to Brand it the big lie unless
you're using it to cover up the big
lie you know remember everything they do
is projection so if they say it's a big
lie that the election was fake they're
basically telling you as clearly as
possible the election was
rigged you can't get more clear than
that now again this is the hitis filter
and it's based on the fact that people
choose their
words not by
coincidence it's not a
coincidence um they're they're calling
it the big lie
because it was true that would the only
reason they would call it that
honestly well Scott Scott
Galloway is uh
basically uh you know saying that Biden
is gone and the Democrats are likely to
lose but uh Galloway is not in favor of
um Trump because he thinks he's a
basically uh unstable uh and
dangerous so Trump is unstable and
dangerous here's a question for Scott
Galloway having awakened in a world
where you found out
that everything about Biden's Health was
made up and fake and in a world where
the main Campaign theme of Biden the
main Campaign theme was to find people
hoax which even Snopes has debunked and
he's probably aware of that by now so
the two biggest
claims of the administration are known
to be
hoaxes there's no question about them
but yet he's still believing that Trump
is unstable and
dangerous how do you wake up from two
gigantic hoaxes and then think that the
same people who told you those two
hoaxes are right about this dangerous
part or do you think that he came to
that conclusion on his own and was not
influenced by the news that's that's
rhetorical we're all we're all
influenced by the news if the news had
not covered it
As Trump was the problem he wouldn't
have that opinion because that's that's
an assigned opinion you can tell an
assigned opinion from a real one the
assigned ones just agree with the
narrative that you see on the TV those
are assigned opinions and the way they
assign them is they just shade the news
and leave out context until you agree
with whatever they're
selling but it's kind of amazing because
Galloway would be unusually smart and
unusually shall I say St StreetWise you
know the common sense kind of good smart
stuff
and having broken through break broken
free of several major hoaxes from his
own team he's still clinging to the most
ridiculous one the president that we had
for four years and didn't cause any of
this didn't cause any of
this and we're looking at a president
who started the Ukraine war basically I
mean to imagine that these are somehow
equivalent risks is
something you couldn't get on your own
you couldn't just look at the
information and come to that conclusion
you would have to be a little bit
brainwashed all right my favorite uh
story that doesn't really have any
importance but uh candus Owens is
getting into a little online fight with
Constantine
kissen uh now I don't know what
Constantine's middle name is but I hope
to God it doesn't start with the letter
k
anyway um so Constantine
kissen um was a kind of mocking Candace
Owens Candace Owens did a video in which
she's so I'm going to paraphrase so
don't blame her if I paraphrase it wrong
she's she's got a sense that science has
been so unreliable lately that even
things that you would have accepted
without question are now on the table
for example exles were the moon landing
which she's in increasingly doubtful
about uh but also she brought up the
flat
earthers and and she said something
along the lines of you know you never
know you know sort of sort of allowing
that science is so
bad that maybe even the Earth is
flat
now I took that as sort of a playful
hyperbole
meaning I don't know if she believes
that literally she's just sort of
putting it out there to make an extreme
point that science has not been reliable
lately um but Constantine who's got some
I think his family's got a sciency
background I think his father was a
scientist Etc so he's pro- science as a
lot of people are and he mocks Candace
and he says uh it's true for too long
big science has convinced us that the
Earth Earth is round against all the
evidence what a relief it is to finally
see this spous Theory challenged perhaps
now our planes ships and vehicles will
will at last be able to navigate the
planet I mean the planet so he's making
a joke Flat Earth and Planet the
flet um so I had to I had to get
involved because well sometimes I can
just be an
 sometimes there's no reason
sometimes it's just for fun
so I weighed in and I said uh I said the
round earthers are a cocky
Bunch uh but not as cocky as we
simulation believers who think that none
of it is base reality includ including
your belief in
shapes I I debunk your belief in
shapes now now I'm serious but I'm not
serious I'm not serious that I care too
much about the
debate and trying to insert myself into
it was really just for fun um but I
think it's kind of cocky to take
anything that science says is definitely
true and imagine that 200 years from now
you'll
agree take any point in history any
point then take a dart and throw it at a
list of all the things we thought were
true according to science sh
and see where the dart landed and then
check that thing in 200 years do you
think it'll still be
true probably not we we keep revising
everything we know and we think we're
done like every 50 years we're like
finally we got everything figured out we
got the molecules we got the big bang we
got it all figured out and then 100
years later we're like how did we ever
think it was all about you know
particles and you know what's a wave and
what's a particle how do we think that
well I think that we are
inevitably and probably the mo the
easiest I think this is the easiest
prediction I'll ever
make it will become a much bigger thing
that we might be a
simulation and the reason is we're going
to build a simulation and there's no way
to stop it we have ai we know how to
build software
environments I would be surp urised if
it doesn't already exist you don't think
that somewhere there's an AI Avatar in
the game that is already living his
life and is programmed not to know it's
an
avatar of course somewhere because AI
can do that for you you you just have
the AI being the brains of the NPCs and
the games and you tell them you program
them you believe you're real you are
base reality if anybody questions you
nope make sure you argue you are base
reality and it would look exactly like
us we wouldn't be able to tell the
difference now you're going to say but
Scott um you know he could just look
around his fake world and he could see
the
pixels can you see your
pixels no all you have to do is put one
line of code in there that says you will
see everything clearly even if it's not
clear your brain will just interpret
everything everything as a clear picture
that's all you need and it will just
tell you what not to think and not to
look at so that you don't accidentally
discover that you're not
real easy peasy so once we build our own
simulations and people are convinced
holy hell I'm watching this little
character like I'm God you know because
he doesn't know he's being watched but
you're watching the 3D version of
somebody living their life and you will
observe that they act and talk like
regular people in the real world and if
you quiz them they'd say no no no I
think I was put here by God or some
version of that as soon as you see we
can do it and that's less than a year
away if it's not already done as soon as
you see we can do it you'll know you're
in
one other people will be harder to
convince but most people will say oh God
you got me yeah we're a simulation we
have to
be all right all right so we cocky
simulation Believers say you just wait
your time is coming all right ladies and
gentlemen that's all I got for today
thanks for joining I'm going to talk to
the Beloved local subscribers privately
um thanks for joining on X and YouTube
and Rumble and we'll see you tomorrow
same
