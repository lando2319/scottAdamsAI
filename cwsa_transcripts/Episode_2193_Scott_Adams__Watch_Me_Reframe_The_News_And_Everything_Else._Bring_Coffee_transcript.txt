today
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization we
call it coffee with Scott Adams and you
know what's the best thing that's ever
happened to you that's for sure
if you'd like to take that experience up
to all capital levels you know all all
capital letters
that's the peak experience
well all you need is a cup of Margaret
glass I'll take your cells this time you
can't even flaska vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine the
other day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous it happens there I'll go
well nebula run
[Music]
it's better with the microphone on isn't
it
why did you let me go so far without
telling me the microphone was off
[Music]
we're gonna have to start all over no
we're not no we're not
well
the good news is that we're all on track
now
we're all on track
and I'd like to give you again an update
on the technique I've been using against
my online
uh used to be called Twitter but now X
situation and I find that these two
comments work really well
comment number one
are you drunk
it turns out that if you ask your
critics if they're drunk
and they're acting drunk
you have about a 30 chance of getting
that right I think the number of
inebriated people using social media is
way higher than anybody mentions it's
got to be you know probably half of all
users are are drunk or stoned when
they're when they're tweeting
all right the other one that I use
besides are you drunk which does seem to
shut things down pretty quickly
I've been saying I'm sorry your news
sources did this to you you seem unaware
of any of the context
that's how they play you
so instead of dealing with the content I
say I'm really sorry that they did this
to you I don't really have time to
explain the whole situation but this is
how they get you
let me give you the best example of this
right now the critics of mine are saying
how dare you say
that these charges against President
Trump
are
you know trivial or small or no big deal
or just just free speech
how many of those people do you think
are aware of the compilation clip of
Hillary Clinton and top Democrats
complaining about the validity of the
2016 election
do you think any of them have seen it
I doubt it probably not one
so a lot of these conversations that
look like disagreements are nothing like
that they're not disagreements at all
it's just one people have seen both
sides of a question and the other
haven't
that's the entire story
some people have seen the whole story
some people have seen half
of course they have a different opinion
some people have seen half the story
now what about the people who say that
Scott
it's not about free speech
Trump actually tried to get you know a
fake set of electors
how many of those people know that
that's something that's happened before
in the past
and it's not even unusual and the
Supreme Court would sort it out if there
was a problem
how many of them know that that that's
like a thing that's happened in the past
none
probably none
um
let's see what else is it give me give
me some more examples let's just take
the Trump situation his charges
what else do the does the political left
not even know
do you think that they know that the
judge
is has been anti-trump for some time
probably not
probably don't know that
do they know that the uh the best
attorneys in the world when they look at
the DC situation
the best attorneys
are completely aware that the case will
not be determined on the facts it's only
the jury
the jury if they like Trump
which they don't
yeah and why do we talk about that
casually
do you think anybody in the left knows
that the top lawyers both left and right
already know what the result will be
independent of the facts does that
bother anybody that we know how the
outcome will be before the facts are
presented to the jury
I don't think so because I don't think
that they're aware
that in Washington DC we don't have a
functional Court
for the political stuff it probably is
fine for crime
you know the little stuff but from the
political stuff we don't have anything
like a like a functional
Department of Justice
in Washington DC
so how many people know that so again
um do not engage people who have not
been informed you should show sympathy
for their situation oh it's sort of like
you know somebody who is a low mental
capability did something to you you
wouldn't necessarily be mad you wouldn't
like it but you'd say oh that was the
person who's operating with diminished
capabilities so you've got to treat it
differently and
joking aside
hyperbole aside and even politics aside
uh is it's really useful to treat people
who have been abused as victims if you
treat them as your opponent you're in
the wrong game so here's your first
reframe
your first reframe is those people who
are arguing with you on social media
are not arguing with you
they're acting out something that's the
result of abuse they've been they've
been abused
by Propaganda
there's no way it's good for the people
who are talking to you and it's not good
for you
the only difference is you know that
they are victims and they don't yet
so just the fact that they don't know
their victims doesn't mean you can't
treat them with empathy and sympathy but
don't engage
don't engage if you engage they're going
to think that they're in some kind of a
conversation with two informed citizens
who have different opinions nothing like
that's happening
there's nothing like that it's just one
side who is aware of the news and the
other side is aware of half of the news
that's all it is
not any kind of a disagreement
so we talk about our you know the
country is falling apart and we disagree
on everything not really
not really
we don't we just have heard different
stories that's very different than
disagreeing
all right uh in the big musk versus Zuck
upcoming fight that might actually
happen musk apparently has such a bad
back that he's getting an MRI and might
even need an operation before he could
go ahead and do the fight with
Zuckerberg if it happens at all
now here's my philosophy question to you
if you apparently musk is in severe back
pain pretty much all the time based on
some long-standing back problems
the richest person in the world
but you had to have severe back pain all
the time
would you do it
that's your choice severe back pain all
the time although maybe there's some way
to solve it right it might be solvable
but you don't know
I wouldn't I wouldn't do that at all I
mean
yeah maybe I'd choose over being
desperately poor but you'd have to go
all the way to desperately poor before I
choose back pain back pain is about the
worst thing that can happen to you
yeah if you if anybody is suffering from
back pain can you confirm it's just
about the the worst thing that could
happen to you because it's there all the
time right now I have a I have you know
some legitimate empathy
because I have screaming back pain from
the time I wake up
for about
40 minutes right and by the time I sent
my office chair and I'm drinking my
coffee it's completely gone it's gone
for the rest of the day it doesn't
bother me during the day but the first
40 minutes
I I just want to be dead
and then I imagine what would that be
like all day long imagine working 80
hours a week
you know musk's schedule and having all
the conflict he has in his life
and all the the complexity and then
having a bad back
imagine going through the things that
he's had to go through with the bad back
I mean
that's the most impressive thing he's
ever done
is to do what he did in the last three
years with a severe back problem
talk about the highest level of
challenge
highest level of challenge it's amazing
but you know you don't get credit for
that in history history is not going to
say he did it despite you know an insane
physical problem
they're just going to say you did it
you really need to miss half the story
if you don't know that there was a
physical limitation there that should
have stopped just about anybody and it
didn't stop him
so that's pretty impressive
all right
um I'm now going to reframe the entire
world and you're going to see the
beginning of it it's the most maybe the
most important reframe of the United
States
it is history
it goes like this
at first it's not going to seem like
much
but you have to watch the whole play
right so this is just the beginning
don't judge it yet
the beginning is the simple observation
that comparing ethnic groups by their
average performance
on anything
doesn't make sense
that's a dumb comparison and I say that
as a person who's trained in comparing
things right if you have a degree in
economics you're trained in comparing
things do we do this or that if we had
done this versus that it's all about
comparing things
the dumbest thing you could ever compare
is the average of a bunch of people who
are all different
oh look the average of this clump of
people who are all different is getting
worse results from this clump of people
who all the individuals within it are
different from each other
it's it's nonsensical political
Ridiculousness let me tell you what does
make sense
you should measure the the difference in
performance now performance would be
everything from promotions to college to
income staying out of jail whatever it
is you should compare the performance of
these two groups
one group who's been exposed to these
strategies of success
and another group that has not been
taught at a young age what to do to
succeed
because school doesn't do that school
teaches you skills and those are good if
you learn them but they don't teach you
what is the what is the concept
of preparing for Success what do you do
if you showed me that there were two
groups that both prepared for Success
they learned all the same tools but one
of them had a very different performance
them and only then would I say maybe we
should dig into this
might be something going on here maybe
discrimination
maybe something else
but until you compare the groups that
have taken the same strategy
you don't know anything
so if one group is heavy on strategy
let's say Asian Americans
just pick one let's say the Asian
Americans I don't know if this is true
but anecdotally it looks true they have
a big focus on education
is that fair Asian Americans big focus
on education
probably now that's just one element of
success
right but it's by far not the the only
thing but it's really big
so should you confu should you compare
Asian American success
to let's say any other group
white Americans and and then conclude
something
do you know what I conclude when white
Americans are compared to Asian
Americans and Asian Americans are you
know just killing and income and college
and grades and all that
I say what would happen if white people
did the same stuff
what would happen if we were all raised
the same way Asians Asian Americans
raise their kids
would it be different
I don't know
I don't know but we've never done it so
how would I know as if the the minimum
you need to do is compare people who
have learned
the techniques of success
now how in the world does anybody learn
the techniques of success
well here is where systemic racism
really looms large
in in my opinion outside of the the the
school systems that are systemically
racist against black Americans
especially
outside of the school system's own
systemic racism the biggest form
is that people who are already
successful
know how to tell their kids to be
successful
am I right
if you're around successful people you
just sort of pick it up
through osmosis you don't even need to
be taught you just watch it and then it
becomes you
but if you don't have access to anybody
who's got a legitimate you know legal
job that's killing it you just don't
even know anybody you don't know anybody
who succeeded how are you going to learn
it
the school isn't going to teach you
your parents might not know
and your friends don't know and you
become the average of your friends what
are you going to do
well I'll tell you what I'm going to do
I'm going to reframe everything and uh
it starts with getting canceled
getting canceled is the most yeah most
of you know I got canceled worldwide
Dilbert was taken out of all the
newspapers in the world all of my books
have been removed from the Rex or at
least except for the used books
so I'm the most canceled person maybe
ever I don't know I might I might be the
most thoroughly canceled person in
Civilization
but
like I always say and here's another
reframe
when everything goes to hell and
actually this is one of the reframes in
in my book I'm going to tell you about
um
when everything goes to hell it always
opens up other opportunities
if you're focusing on the part that fell
apart
you're going to be blinded or just not
notice there's something opened up you
know another door opened so here's the
door that I'm opening for myself
you didn't have to help
I could do this one myself
uh in a few days and I'll tell you
exactly when my new book reframing your
brain will be available
now it'll be independently published
working with Joshua lisek to get it into
Amazon other places so I'll tell you
what you can pre-buyate the pre-sale
it's not yet it'll be soon but this is a
book of reframes that tell you how to be
successful
some of them are I took some of the best
ones out of my book which you're
familiar with
this is the the book I wrote It's the
most influential book
in the field of personal success
now when I say that
if you haven't read the book you can say
really I'm not even sure I've ever heard
of that book if you have read the book
you agree with me
because you because the number of people
whose lives have changed because they
read this book is really crazy I hear
about it every day somebody just today
said they're almost a millionaire
because of following these systems
versus goals stuff here and
Ten Years Later 10 years later this is
sort of the OG this is the book that has
influenced most of the other successful
books
yeah in in the personal success category
now this book got canceled so you can't
buy it in stores
hold this into your mind for a moment
the most useful and influential book
in modern times on how to succeed which
has changed everything from People's
Health weight careers social lives
marriage kids
fundamentally improved
I don't know tens of thousands of lives
unavailable because of the one thing I
said that one time
here's the good news
second edition
which will be available also in days you
can't you can't buy this yet not
available in stores it will be available
as soon as I look at it I basically just
have to look at it and make sure there's
no typos
same with this the only thing holding it
up I think at this point is I just have
to re-look at it and make sure there's
all the pages are there
so I will let you know when they're
available but here's here's the payoff
if you were an adult
and you consumed these two books
you have basically a superpower and I'm
really I'm uncomfortable with marketing
so I'll let I'll let those who have read
at least this book
you know those who read the first cop
version of this you can be the ones who
tell other people what you've got out of
it right and it's going to be a big
story
but if you were to be an adult who read
these two books you would you just have
a dominant advantage over other people I
mean it would be a pretty big Advantage
but suppose you wanted your children to
see these books well good luck with that
because you're not going to get your
kids to read these
you know what I mean it's just not going
to happen so one of the things that I
did in this book
is I boiled down the reframes to one
sentence a piece
so you'll be able to see in the back
the one sentence version of the reframes
they're 160 plus of them and those would
be easy easy to describe to somebody and
easy to transmit but there's more
the best parts of these two books is
being put into a student guide as we
speak the student guide will be
available to homeschoolers and anybody
else who wants it and it is specifically
designed to simplify down to student
level
the most important lessons that somebody
at that age needs uh to get going
right now that should be available after
these two books it just it's going to
take us a little editing and preparation
time uh also worth working with uh
Joshua lisac on that who by the way was
homeschooled
so I'm working with somebody who really
understands the market
and
this book or the the guide the student
guide
you should no longer look at the
difference of performance after it
becomes widely available the only the
only thing you should measure from that
time on is people who who were taught
this material
versus the people who were not
would you want to make a bet which of
those two groups just does better it's
not even going to be close
the the group that was trained on how to
succeed is almost certainly going to
succeed
right because
success is like every other thing
if you don't know the the method
how are you going to do it just luck
just luck now the questions you ask are
what about audio yes there will be um
audio of both these books
but that will follow a little bit so
there'll be you know you'll see the
Kindle and the hard copy right away
and I'll tell you what it's available
for pre-sale by the way there won't I
don't think it will be pre-sale
because it's independently published the
moment you can buy it is just for sale
so I'll actually get my first copy
the same time you do so this is why
those situations where the author won't
see it until the same time you do I'll
just buy a copy like you do so the first
time I'll see a good proper copy might
be when I buy it off of Amazon same as
you
all right yes people will be stealing it
but
People Are People
can I convert it into comics for easy
consumption that would actually not help
at all
the the student guide is so simplified
because that's what makes it useful
you're not going to need a comic you
know it basically is going to be half
the page of text
this is going to change your life you
know the 30 different times so the 30
different lessons the most the top 30
things all right so in addition to being
a Shameless marketing for the book I'm
really shooting for something much
bigger than selling a book
I think you all know I don't need to
sell any books right I've done okay I
I'm I'm literally retirement age
I don't need to write a book writing a
book is terrible
the the past year and a half of my life
if you said say what's the worst thing
that happened to you in the last year
and a half
you would probably say my divorce
or you might say getting canceled
worldwide that happened in the last year
and a half
now I would say that the worst thing
that happened is I wrote a book
to me that was the worst thing that
happened in a year and a half writing a
book is terrible work it takes you out
of the real world it just puts you in it
was basically like solitary confinement
for half of your life
so you have to want to write a book
right the first ones were just for money
the first books I ever wrote just for
money but now I have money
so these are they have to make a
difference or I'm not interested right
the this book was written for my teenage
son
uh he was the the person I had in mind
as the recipient and maybe when he was
older but he was the one I was thinking
about when I wrote it so I so I at this
point I have to have a real clear idea
of who's benefiting from my work or I'm
just not interested
so that's where we're at I believe this
could change the world and the and the
main reframe is stop comparing
any group except the ones who have been
trained on success
compare them and then you learn
something otherwise you don't learn
anything
all right let's talk about politics and
such
um
you know what's interesting it turns out
that the the biggest demographic group
in the Democratic party is single women
I've talked about that before but it
occurred to me that if Democrats the
Democrat Party is dominated by single
women
and the Democrats would you say they're
in charge
at the moment it's kind of a split
government a little bit but at least in
terms of the presidency and you know
they've got some
at least you know a little bit of a
power going
um
but if you were a single woman do you
still think this is a patriarchy
so the the Democrats are the dominant
party I would say and the dominant part
of the dominant party is single women
but their biggest complaint is that we
live in a patriarchy
now the abortion question
uh I'm just guessing that you might be a
Democrat when I see somebody who doesn't
understand the story or the context of a
story I just assumed Democrat
I hate that that's my first assumption
but Republicans know that the story
about abortion is that it was taken from
the wrong place to decide it which was
the Supreme of the federal government
and it was put in the right place to
decide it which is the states
so
the Democrats say they lost the right of
abortion the Republicans say we allowed
you to make your own decisions
why are you complaining to us
we allowed you meaning the state you
live in to make its own decision and
we're not even complaining about it
where where all the Democrats
complaining about abortion being legal
in California
have you ever seen it I haven't seen it
I mean they they say what they say about
abortion but they don't say oh you
California
no because California made up his own
mind and the Republicans are like oh
okay that's how it's supposed to work
you've made up your own minds
so
anyway so the patriarchy is now single
women and we're just gonna act like we
haven't noticed
the patriarchy is absolutely single
women right now
how weird at that
all right well the Biden Administration
has this problem which is one of Biden's
greatest successes he would say would be
the infrastructure Bill and that it's
getting people to work and it's boosting
the economy and by the way it might be
I would have no way of knowing does
anybody have a sense of how much the the
bipartisan infrastructure bill
boosted the economy
it is Biden bidenomics
we don't know do we
I mean it wasn't long ago that people
were saying that it takes a long time
for the money to be implemented into
actual projects so there wasn't much
happening yet it was more of a longer
term thing
I don't know sounds like that
the infrastructure is making much of a
difference but it could
I'm open to the argument that it's
already making a difference I just don't
know
but here's the funny thing the signs
that are being put up so that the
consumers will know that Joe Biden was
the you know the architect of the these
great works
the sign actually says Joe Bart Joe
Biden bipartisan infrastructure bill
so the sign said that you know why this
project is happening let's say a road
Improvement or something it says the Joe
Biden bipartisan infrastructure bill
you know what would be bipartisan
leave Joe Biden's off the top of it
either say it's not bipartisan which is
fine
not everything has to be bipartisan you
know we vote for candidates hoping often
that our own team will be in charge
so bipartisan isn't such a big deal I
mean it's good it's not that it's not
the end-all but uh
what it what would be more absurd than
putting your name on the top of
something you just called bipartisan
that's as close as you could get
to the opposite of what he was trying to
accomplish wait a minute if it's
bipartisan
once you put the Democrats and the
Republicans brought you this success
that's what bipartisan means
not in Jill Biden's bipartisans
silly
all right I love the Vivek ramaswamy is
going hard at the notion he said well
I'll just read his tweet he says it's
not crazy to think a Ukrainian company's
multi-million dollar bribe to the Biden
family is one reason why Biden is now
showering Ukraine with billions of U.S
taxpayer dollars it's crazier to think
it's totally unrelated
and craziness of all is uh the GOP is
playing along as if they're in on the
ACT
so he's taking it to the next level
so if a vague is saying not only you
know are the bidens dirty but what the
hell is wrong with the rest of the
Republicans for not calling it out
pretty good pretty good by the way are
you hearing other people say this
is anybody but Vivek saying the most
obvious part of the story which is it's
hard to imagine that the Ukraine war and
are supporter for it would look exactly
the same
if the bidens had not been taking money
from Ukraine it would be just the same
no difference
why is he the only person pointing that
out
that's like a really really important
thing
by the way I think I pointed it out
first but
to say
um
so he's doing you know Vivek once again
um sound like a broken record every
single day I wake up and uh X
Twitter is uh trending the fake's name
usually his first name and he said
something provocative that's productive
is not just provocative you know like
Trump does Trump does provocative things
we'll talk about him in a minute
but he's just doing it to get attention
when uh Vivek does something provocative
it's in the context of a a policy
preference
that's really strong
he can get attention for policy
and the policies make sense right it's
not crazy so that you can't do
better than that you just can't do
better than he's doing
all right this is another uh weird and
funny story uh
so there are two stories about Zoom
you know the video conferencing product
one is that um
you have to accept that if you use zoom
zoom might use or will I guess use AI to
look at all of your
presentation from your physical
presentation you know your everything
for your posture to your facial
expressions to the words that you say
even in your private conversations and
if you use zoom you have to sign their
terms of agreement or agree to them that
you would unconditionally and
irrevocably with no opt out
give away your personal
experience as AI training material
now here's the problem
the first thing I thought when I saw
that was well damn it then I will use
zoom how about that how about that huh
well I just won't use it
and then I thought it's too late it's
too late
it's everywhere do you think you could
not use it do you think you could
successfully do business in 2023 by
saying you're the one who won't use it
right yeah try to use teams has anybody
ever tried to use teams
or try to face time to you know 50
people
hello
I think Zoom wins this
I think Zoom will will just get probably
no difference it'll probably just go on
yeah I realize there are competitors but
Zoom just dominates at this point the
other Zoom stories that Zoom itself as a
company is requiring its people to go
back to the office
so even Zoom the product you use instead
of going to the office is making his own
employees go back to the office at least
part of the week it's not full time
all right
um the most important thing of the day
is that mean tweets are back
I thought Trump was being uh unusually
non-provocative lately and I thought it
was working because it seemed like his
poll numbers were pretty solid but in
the context of all these legal
challenges he's decided to fight back
with Mean Tweets
and I could not be happier
I could not be happier with the Mean
Tweets
now I would like to support uh American
women's soccer
for all the usual reasons I I think the
American women's soccer has been
amazingly successful and fun to watch
and
if they can get equal pay that's great
it's a free market if they can get it
they should so I'm all like everything
about women's soccer I like
except
one particular seemingly anti-American
member Megan rapanow
now
uh she she missed a penalty kick kind of
badly and it was one of the reasons they
lost a guess
and so
so Megan Rapido was sort of uh insulting
to Trump I guess the team got invited to
the White House and she said or she said
if they got invited she wouldn't go
because Trump was president
and so here's what Trump says about
Megan being part of the reason that the
women lost
he said many of our players were openly
hostile to America no other country
behaved in such a manner or even close
woke equals failure Nice Shot Megan
oh God the USA is going to hell Mega
so that's Trump Nice Shot Megan
[Laughter]
that is that's so so outstandingly uh
unpresidential
that is just perfect
you're just not supposed to say that
don't say that and then he says it
how do you not love him for that how do
you not
find that endearing I guess you'd really
have to think of yourself or something
but the fact that he's fighting back on
this level Nice Shot he's getting in her
head and ruining her all whatever's left
of her career
then he also went after Nancy Pelosi and
Nancy Pelosi said he was acting like a
scared puppy you know with all the
the legal problems so so Trump tweets I
have been leaving alone the story about
uh Paul Pelosi
but apparently you won't be leaving that
alone for much longer
uh
I don't know none of this is important
but it's the most fun that's happening
in politics is Trump going back to full
insults
he's powering up
all right
um
anyway what do you think about
criminalizing political lies
so this is Jonathan Turley who's been
great on all of this Trump legal stuff
and
do you think that the result of the
Trump trial could be that the courts
would actually make it illegal to have
an opinion that's wrong
to be incorrect
do you think that we could possibly end
up there that the courts would decide
that the you know freedom of speech
isn't what you thought it was
I don't think so well I think the DC
Court could but I don't see any chance
that the Supreme Court could
I don't see any chance of that
so I don't think that there's anything
happening to Trump
with the latest that it challenges that
could survive a supreme court and here
I'm just agreeing with dershowitz so I
feel pretty safe about that
but here's my uh advice for the
Republicans in messaging
so far they've been saying that the
Democrats are weaponizing the government
so they're weaponizing the Department of
Justice and they're weaponizing the IRS
and they're weaponizing the FBI I guess
here's what's wrong with that
and do you see it before I tell you
what's wrong with that political attack
the other side is weaponizing the
government
here's what's wrong
it sounds awesome
sounds awesome you weaponize the
government
oh good
aren't we supposed to do that I like my
government very weaponized
most of the point of a government is to
make sure that criminals and outside
forces don't do bad things to you
weaponize them so we do have a
weaponized government that we weaponize
and tell intelligently and intentionally
to be weapons against outside forces and
sometimes criminal forces
so as a as an attack
you want to be consistent with your good
message and your good point
so when I hear the other side is
weaponized in the government I say to
myself that's a good point
right the logic of it there there's
facts to back it up you've got stories
that fit that quite neatly it's a good
narrative it's a good point it's solid
but the word doesn't work the word
doesn't work so I'm going to give you an
alternative
you don't weaponize is just too strong
of a word strong meaning if you told me
I had weaponized something
I wouldn't even feel bad about it I'd be
like yeah I weaponize that I'll
weaponize it again right in front of you
so how about this
how about calling it destroying the most
valuable asset in the world The
credibility of the US judicial system I
like to say this a lot because if you
forget it you could lose everything
the only thing that keeps America
running is that our court system is
generally credible you know it's flawed
everything's flawed but more credible
than most
Justice systems right if you don't have
a credible justice system you can't do
business without bribery
and you can't have a republic
you can't do anything right it's
basically the base upon which all of
America is built
so it's one thing to say oh it's a
little weaponized that that still
suggests that America survives on that
base it's weaponized we don't like that
but it's still strong it's just
weaponized
but what uh what I see
is if you're using it to you know take
out a political foe over things that are
clearly too trivial to prosecute and any
normal normal world
under that condition I think you're
destroying the credibility of the
justice system that along with the no
bail and the letting everybody out of
prison to run wild in in the in the
streets so the Biden Administration is
destroying the most valuable asset
in the world
the most valuable asset in the world now
you might say Scott that's not true oil
oil is the most valuable asset well you
could run out of a lot of oil and still
survive you could have an oil shortage
still survive
but if your court system breaks down
you're you're out of business
and we're we're at risk of losing The
credibility of our court system I don't
know what happens when you lose a
credibility maybe things just go on I
don't know but it's the most risky thing
I can imagine so I would say it's the
most valuable asset in the world
right there are other countries that
that probably have pretty good Judicial
Systems but since they're not
superpowers
that's that's like a local situation but
when the United States is at risk of the
entire system collapsing because the
foundation upon which is built the
justice system is now being assailed for
political reasons
that's the most dangerous thing
you could ever imagine
now I predict we'll be fine
I predict we'll be fine so I'm talking
about it messaging the messaging should
be more about destroying the most
valuable asset in America
when people come to America
what they talk about is you know maybe
getting a job
but that's all based on the legal system
it's all based on the legal system
they're really coming here because of
our legal system
you just don't talk about it that way
they come here because our courts are
generally fair and everything else can
work because of that simple fact
all right don't lose that let's talk
about my least favorite thing
um so this is teaching you the point of
what I'm going to talk about is teaching
you
how to interpret the news
right the topic I'm going to talk about
I have no interest in
and if you imagine I have interest in
that you're going to get mad at me so
I'm on your side not interested this is
just to teach you how to read the news
Steve Kirsch who you might know as you
know a successful Tech guy who's been
talking a lot about the dangers of covet
vaccinations
and he states that there's a there's a
case of some triplets who got vaccinated
and allegedly altered seriously autistic
within two hours of being vaccinated now
Steve says that it's just math and that
it's proof that uh well he said this he
said he basically said it's proof that
the vaccinations are dangerous and
you said this is stronger statistical
proof than any cause causality study
so he's basically saying the odds of all
three
children who were reportedly completely
normal
the three of them get vaccinated and
then boom their parents say they're just
different kids and they're autistic
now Steve says this is he uses actually
uses the word proof
that from a statistical standpoint
you're really Beyond doubt
do you agree with his statement
that if three identical twins get
vaccinations and in fact turned autistic
within two hours
would you conclude as Steve does that
this is strong statistical proof that
the vaccinations are causing this
all right here's the correct answer it
is not proof
it is a strong red flag I mean the red
flag is
so don't don't give me a hard time about
not seeing the red flag right red flag
red flag everywhere red flag we all see
it there's nobody who doesn't see it
double say Scott doesn't see it I know
you're going to say it you're going to
say it you're going to say that I can't
see it I see it I see it okay now that
we've we've settled that I think I can
talk with you
how do you rule out the possibility
that there was a bad batch just in that
hospital or even just in those needles
where did Steve rule out the possibility
that it was a very localized problem of
a spoiled batch did he
where did Steve rule out that a bad
actor in the hospital had switched down
a batch or contaminated it intentionally
because unfortunately we know that
happens
there are people who are nurses who have
put bad things in Needles literally to
make people sick and die
that's a real thing
do you know what I've never heard of
triplets getting autism from a shot I
never heard of that
I'm not saying it's not possible red
flags red flags all over hey did you
notice the part where I said I can see
them too okay okay okay settle down
settle down I see him too
but you really have to you have to rule
out the more possible options
in the order of most likely to least
likely
most likely it didn't even happen
am I right
the most likely interpretation of this
story is it never happened there were
not three three kids who got shots and
changed two hours later by far is the
most likely
this is not a claim that is false you
hear that right I'm not claiming it
didn't happen I'm saying that if you
were just going to look at it as a news
story and you're just a consumer you're
trying to figure out what's true and
what's not by far the most likely story
because it didn't happen at all just
like UFO reports
what's the most likely explanation of
all the UFO reports people made them up
you know the people who thought they saw
stuff those are by far the most likely
doesn't mean it's true maybe there are
some UFOs but if you see any one UFO
story any individual story
by far the most likely explanation is it
didn't happen at all
somebody thought it is or lied or post
or something
all right how about the possibility that
there would be a criminal
working at the medical center who
actually was trying to injure the kids
and did it somehow intentionally
unfortunately we have seen stories but
like that probably every year of my life
give me a fact check on this I feel like
at least once every year I see a story
about a nurse hurting people with
vaccinations intentionally
am I wrong about once a year
it's not that uncommon whereas I've
heard of exactly zero
other cases where
kids got obviously autism
now
if this is the only time you saw it in
the three twins
does this raise a question with you
here's an obvious question and I don't
know if Steve has dealt with this
why would it only apply to twins
or identical triplets wouldn't they have
seen exactly the same result
one child after another who are just
unrelated to each other
don't you think that the medical center
would be hearing from people who said um
my child is autistic two hours after
this and then the phone rings it's a
different set of parents and they're
like
um something happened to my kid then the
phone rings again it's a different set
of parents saying what's wrong with my
kid just got a vaccination
so you're telling me the three triplets
all got autism within two hours of a
vaccination
but this Medical Center had no warning
that there were any other children who
were unrelated who had the same problem
with the same set of vaccinations no you
haven't heard of anybody coming forward
so now that the triplets have been
publicized what's the first thing that
happens
the other people come forward
this should look exactly like um like a
Serial pedophile
you know there's there's the first case
and then all the other victims say whoa
whoa whoa that same person did the same
thing to me and then they come forward
so you don't think the triplet story
would have surfaced
25 other parents who say whoa I wasn't
really thinking about the connection but
you're right my kid really changed
drastically after the shot
where's that
where's that
context please
um
what else uh
so you'd have to know that the parents
are not hoaxing you'd have to know that
they really did see a difference in the
kids they do have photos I'm not sure if
the photos are telling you what they say
their photo
um
and then here's here's the hardest one
to rule out in a situation like this the
hardest thing to rule out
is the thing you didn't think of
that's always the one that gets you in
the ass like somebody's going to come up
with oh you forgot to mention that the
entire story was Ai and and the children
were AI
and the parents were Ai and you
shouldn't have seen it coming you knew
this was going to happen they were just
AI this never happened
now I don't think that's true
but I'm giving you an example so that
you can imagine and don't don't worry
about it being AI it's probably not AI
but I'm trying to give you just an
example so that your mind can say oh
yeah there could be things that would
explain it
that I just didn't think of
and that's why you can't you can't
calculate the odds of stuff like this
Steve believes he could calculate the
odds because he has a good grasp
of the alternative explanations
that's not a thing
that's not a thing
how could you know that you know the
odds of a thing happening when you not
you have never even thought of the thing
right so in 2023 we can still say it
wasn't AI
if this happened in two years
could you still say yeah I looked at it
and I saw the video is definitely not AI
in two years do you think you'll be able
to tell the difference between an AI
story with lots of characters in detail
versus like a real one I don't think so
I don't think so now we're not there yet
as far as I know
but suppose suppose uh I'll just throw I
suppose
suppose China was already there with AI
because I think America is probably
there we don't see the good stuff you
know there's probably a whole bunch of
stuff that the public hasn't seen that's
a whole level above presumably
suppose China wanted to start a big
rumor in the United States and make us
fight about vaccinations
could they have created an AI
that they know is AI but when we see it
we've only seen our other AI that
doesn't look convincing so we go all
right we don't think we can make this
with our AI therefore it must be real
but do you know what China has
you don't think China could just go to
their AI I'm sure they're working on it
and just say give us some American
Family triplets tell a story about how
they got autism with the shots Etc
and make it look real and turn it into a
meme
I don't know could they have done that I
don't think that happened but if you
hadn't considered all the possibilities
you might be surprised
now can I close by saying that if it's
true that three identical twins got
autism from the shot well well they got
autism two hours after the shot that is
a big red flag nothing I said should
change the fact that I too like you see
a big red flag
I just don't think it's proof
all right might be uh
here is the uh the best evidence yet
that the war in Ukraine is not a war at
all it is a negotiation it is
specifically a negotiation that's
waiting for Trump to take over the
presidency or maybe a Republican
but
um
so I guess Ukraine
allegedly took out on some big Russian
ship
uh and then Russia decided to quote
retaliate which they warned they would
do by a massive shelling in Ukraine
overnight that killed at least six
people
clue number one that this is not a war
what's the point of retaliation in a war
uh uh why would you need to retaliate
in the context of a war
I'm no I'm no General but let me just
put this out here and you fact check me
if I'm a general and I'm going to run a
war I'm going to use all of my assets
for winning the war
I'm going to do the best thing I can do
with my assets to win the war you know
what I'm never going to do
send a message
I I think I'll send a message that I'm
not happy about the fact that you you uh
also were in a war and you hurt one of
our assets
I'm not happy about that so I'll do some
retaliation
that's not a war activity
retaliation is when you're in a stable
situation do you know who retaliates
Israel against the Palestinians
and vice versa
are they at War
well maybe somebody would call it that
but it's not like some force is running
across the border of the other country
right it's a long-term somewhat stable
situation unfortunately it's stable with
terrorism but
oh you wouldn't call it a war would you
would you call it a war
it's more like you know some terrorism
whatever now I'm not making I'm not
making the uh analogy
of the Middle East to Ukraine because
you'll just argue about the details so
the details are all different right so
I'm not saying one tells you about the
other I'm just saying that when you see
stuff like retaliation you don't see it
in the context of actual War
do you because I don't think it has a
function
what was was Kiev gonna fight less
because six people died in massive
shelling
six people
there were probably more people died
mowing their lawns yesterday six people
I mean tragic as it is nobody wants
anybody to die but in a war if a major
retaliation took six people that feels
like theater to me it doesn't even feel
like War I'd feel like War if I were
there I get it I get it I get it if I
were there it would feel like a war I I
understand
but from the outside
it looks to me the the intentions of
both sides now seem obvious
the intention
is to wait until Trump's in power
because they know he's going to end it
and they know Biden who won't
right
do you think that zielinski really wants
to get back all the territory
or does he want to just go back to being
the rich guy who runs Ukraine without
worrying that Russia is going to kill
him
Penske would be pretty happy to not be
in a war to be in power to be rich to be
you know the national celebrity and make
it appear at least like he stopped
Russia even though land was traded at in
the end probably but he would still look
like a hero
for for having stopped the Conquering of
Ukraine so I think zelenski wants a way
out
he knows he's not going to you know win
back that territory by now and I think
Putin wants a way out and they both see
there's only one way out
Am I Wrong there's literally one way
this can go
Trump gets elected or somebody who's
trump-like right could be
couldn't believe the vague but somebody
Trump like gets effect gets elected and
then just forces both sides to stop
fighting
which we can do tomorrow
yeah Biden can't do it because there are
questions about his let's say Financial
interests
but trumpcad
you could do it tomorrow
you know Trump's boast that he could end
the war in a day
that is the least exaggerated most he's
ever made
now I'm not going to predict that he
will because you know nobody does
anything in today but he could
he could literally force a ceasefire
and say look every person who dies after
today is a waste of time and you're just
idiots
because I because I've decided to end it
might take a few weeks but you should
stop shooting now
because every death from this point on
has no purpose just wasted wasted life
stop now and I'll tell you it might take
a few weeks to work it out that actually
would stop the war in a day
all he has to do is tell him I guarantee
it's over
you don't know it yet but I guarantee
this war is over just stop shooting
today
I'll work it out might take us a few
weeks
yeah you'd be done today
and I think Vivek could do the same
thing actually they might they might not
know enough about Vivek to be afraid so
Trump has an advantage there
um
well let me ask you this question
if Trump were to take office do you
think you should prosecute Joe Biden
I'm really curious about your responses
all right MC mostly knows
yeah I think age alone and the effect it
would have on the country would be bad
there should be some kind of uh Middle
Ground
I would love to see it investigated and
put into an official government report
but if the official government decided
look it's time to stop the precedent
yeah it's time to stop going after our
political figures the country should
know everything the bidens did
but because of his age and because these
are now settled settled problems we do
think that everybody should be treated
the same under the law but the the
country is better
if we just do what's good for the
country
I I could imagine
um letting Biden go now I do imagine
that Biden would pardon himself so it's
not going to be an issue don't you think
don't you think it was a mistake for
Trump to not pardon himself of all past
and future crimes before he left the
White House
they're probably you know I don't think
he could have been necessarily
re-elected under that umbrella
probably the only way he could get
elected is actually you know fight this
stuff out in the court of public opinion
and the real courts and and win that
seems like the only way to get there
but it but if the only reason he were
able to run for reelection is that he
had pardoned himself for all past and
future crimes
I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with
that
all right what did Henry say that's a
brilliant Point somebody made a
brilliant Point here
well I guess I can't find them
but trust me somebody made a brilliant
Point according to somebody else
all right
uh what have I missed is there anything
I missed today
any stories
um
Letting Go would destroy you should
prosecute
no pardoning yourself as a bad take
yeah I think pardoning yourself so is a
bad idea
what's that
Jew Mal Please share my story I'm facing
25 years to life for defending myself
against a mad black man with a gun who
tried to end my life
huh well I don't know much about your
story but I'll note that you said it
all right
um
you can see all the evidence that give
send go Drew Mal d-r-e-w-m-o-w
now I'm not endorsing it I'm only seeing
it in the comments but if it's true that
all the evidence is there you can go see
for yourself
uh
equal pay deal earnings revealed women
seems like most of the men's earnings
what
uh pardoning yourself of political
charges feels Fair yeah good point on
that if you're political if you're
pardoning yourself on things that even
the country thinks are political
you probably get away with that pretty
easily
U.S women's soccer team is getting half
of men's earnings
how do you prove that I don't know you
know
I'm not sure that's a problem
so if you're saying to yourself the men
collectively are earning all this money
and then the women collectively are
taking some of the men's money
isn't that kind of similar to
all of the other players on
LeBron's teams
I feel like LeBron is the reason you
went to watch the game
or you know Michael Jordan This Day
and all the other players were just good
players who benefited from the fact they
had a good player on the team there's no
real Fair way to allocate money
for sports
uh every every scheme you pick is unfair
for a different reason
because people don't contribute the same
men's soccer can exist without women's
soccer
yeah
I mean if if you made it up to me
I'm sure that I would say the men's
teams if they earn the money should keep
the body
where I don't think you're on a
different side
I'm just saying that sometimes
contracts are settled by president
and not because there's a logical reason
so it's one of the great things about
what we do as as humans and Americans
that we sort of agree that a deal is a
deal
without being able to really argue the
philosophy of it
if I were to do a licensing deal for
example
let's say it was a licensing for
t-shirts or something putting Dilbert on
a t-shirt
walking into the deal
I would know what the end deal was going
to be before I started negotiating
because there are so many people have
made deals for t-shirts that they're
sort of a pretty standard I don't know
it's a 15 royalty or something like that
whatever the number is it's kind of what
everybody gets you know maybe I asked
for a little more because I think I got
some Market advantage or something but
basically everybody who's licensing an
image for a t-shirt gets something like
the same deal
so
a lot of the times it's not about
anything that's fair
it's just Market power
if you have Market power
you get more stuff the women built
themselves up some Market power
by pushing their political view and
making it popular or being part of
something that's popular and they use
that market power to get themselves more
money
I don't hate that
I don't hate it it's not entirely unlike
the rest of the world
you know the the rest of the world is
people battling in a completely legal
way
to get more attention get more money get
a better deal
at the moment the women just nailed it
so the women they pressed an advantage
you know they had let's say a political
public opinion Advantage they pressed it
hard they got a good result the men kind
of sat it out and now they have to live
with what they got but to me this is the
free market doing what it does
I think you're looking at a free market
situation and adding your opinion to it
and you don't need to
yeah was it was it quote fair to the men
fair is just a concept it's not
something that happens in the real world
in the real world people pursue power
if you have the power to get a good deal
that the other team doesn't like but
they have to sign it anyway you're
probably going to do it
so the the women's soccer story is not
about what was right or Fair
it was about them cleverly using
um soft power
to get themselves raisins and I would
say good for them
good for them and if the men's the men's
teams if they can figure out a free
market legal way
to argue that money back into their
pockets good for them
good for them they're all competitors
and they're competitors by Nature so if
you put a bunch of competitors together
and they compete what are we complaining
about
they they're competing they're competing
on money they're competing on contracts
they're competing on the field at the
moment the women got to win
good for them
all right
what else is happening anything else
happening
political coercion is part of soft power
show
uh what how much of a cut did you get
from the Dilbert doll well I was also
syndicated and so I had a deal that I
shared my licensing Revenue with the
syndication company in addition to
the doll company
and then I share half of what I get from
all that with the government
so it ends up being pennies
um if I had to guess it was something
like a 15 royalty probably in that
neighborhood
of the 15 half of that would go to The
Syndicate that gives me seven and a half
of that half would go to taxes
and lawyers and accountants and people
who make that deal possible
so maybe two percent
maybe two percent per dollar I would get
something like that
it's not much
yeah licensing works because you do a
lot of it not because per unit you're
making a lot
uh elon's paying legal fees for people
who were fired because they used Twitter
I don't know if he's thought that
through
because it's going to be really hard to
determine who got fired just because of
Twitter
it'll be tough
uh Dilbert product placement in
blockbuster movies
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do
advertising in a Blockbuster movie
all right
um
women have conspired to keep you single
Patrick says
well thank you
appreciate that
um
yeah if you added up it
it comes to something
uh you can do an R-rated Dilbert movie
well I think movies are done
I just
I can't even imagine watching a movie
anymore
it just doesn't feel like a thing that I
do
I can't I can't remember the last time I
watched a whole movie The only movies
I'm watching
uh let's see do any of you do this if
you're watching a movie alone there's
nobody with you to complain about you
fast forwarding do you fast forward
through the scenes that you already know
where it's going
so if I'm watching a movie and there's
it's in the early in the movie and you
see the protagonist the person who's
going to be the star of the movie and
they're getting really lovey with their
wife
do you need to watch
like 10 minutes of it
I get it he really loves his wife and
when she's in Mortal danger later in the
movie it's going to really tug in my
heartstrings because he loves her so
much they love each other so I see that
it's like oh okay this is 10 minutes of
you making me feel bad because I'll feel
bad when something happens to her
because now that I know she's really in
love with this guy fast forward fast
forward all right looks like a car Chief
car chase is starting
all right yeah car chase car chase car
chase somebody's tied to a chair for
torture
don't really need the details chair
chair chair chair chair gone
um and now it's a big fight and uh I'm
gonna I'm just gonna
spitball here I'm a professional writer
so you probably wouldn't be able to do
this on your own but let's say there's a
scene in the movie
in which the bad guy or one of them has
the drop on the good guy or one of them
has the gun pointed right at him and
there and the the good guy is disarmed
how could you get out of that situation
nobody's ever done this before
one of the good guy character helpers
suddenly appears not as injured as you
thought and shoots the person who has
has anybody done that yet
I I has anybody seen that in the movie
yet because I think it's Innovative I
don't know if anybody's thought of that
the person you didn't know
is there and shoots them in the last
minute
now you can repeat that as many times as
necessary you can put your protagonist
in danger have a person who's been off
screen for a while shoot the bad guy
repeat Rippy trippy
now do I need to watch that scene
as soon as I see the bad character with
a gun pointing at the good character and
the good character is like oh no my head
is going to be exploded
I'm like person shows up from around the
corner shoots the person fast forward
fast forward fast forward
I don't know why people watch movies
honestly I understand why children do
because they haven't learned the pattern
yet but once you see the pattern
what are you gonna do
yeah
all right ladies and gentlemen on
YouTube
that's all I've got for you today so I'm
going to say bye you've been amazing
let's go change the world or reframe it
