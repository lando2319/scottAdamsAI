well what a mess i am today
let's get everything working here
i'm seeing a question on the locals
platform as i signed on it says if scott
is a simplifier why does it
why is it so complicated to do this live
stream
and the answer is it avoids
simplification like nothing i've ever
seen i'm up to something like 17 steps
on a checklist just to turn this on
and do you think that i can ever do 17
steps on a checklist the same
nope
nope
so
sometimes this is the best you can get
but you know
if you'd like to make
everything better and i think you would
what do you need oh well all you need is
a copper mug or glass of tango chelsea
style canteen jug flask vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day thing
makes everything better
everything except afghanistan
it's called the simultaneous step and it
happens now
go
ah
that's so good
so so good
well let me summarize uh all of the news
china
sucks that's it that's the whole news
now there are details
i'll tell you all the ways that china
sucks or is dangerous to us
but it's all it's all just that china
sucks
and there are lots of ways to express it
let's start first with larry elder
running for governor of california and
i've been trying out some
persuasive
slogans that he could use
so here are two i tested today
somebody not me came up with this it's
on some signs in southern california
it says we have a state to save so
that's one choice for larry elder
running for governor in the recall
election
we have a state to save or make
california livable
make california livable
so we have a state to save 52 percent
and make california livable 48.
so people like both of those but we have
a state to save
got a little bit a little bit more
and it's not bad
it's not bad
somebody says i vote neither
well come up with a better one
so
a b testing is all about uh if you have
a better idea let's test it
all right
i feel as if
i need a new category
i'm going to call it
non-surprising news
non-surprising news
things which are news
but since you knew they were going to
happen
why are they news really
so um
keep california live i'm seeing some
suggestions here
save our state
about time for better yeah those are all
pretty good actually
our golden opportunity free california
got some good ideas here
um
all right
so here in non-surprising news
the infrastructure bill's in trouble
do i is it just the same news every day
let me make a prediction
for the news any day next week pick a
day next week
tuesday
tuesday next week
prediction
the infrastructure bill will be in
trouble
let's just see if i'm right
i mean wilder things have happened
but uh this time apparently the
republicans are going to propose a bunch
of
amendments that are politically
embarrassing for the democrats okay
meanwhile joe biden continues to
decompose as afghanistan falls apart
jake sullivan is reporting that
biden didn't think it was quote
inevitable
that the taliban would take control
joe biden
didn't think it was inevitable
that the taliban would take control
is that true
you know if
if i had seen this report
and
they had said it about trump
i would tell you it wasn't true
right
i mean if you've watched me long enough
you know i'd say i don't think that
happened you know unless you unless you
hear it with your own ears you know do
you think trump would ever say that but
do you think do you think biden would
actually say that
he said it in a video
oh
so we do have a record of it
um i it's on a video from july
wow
well july of course was a little
different i mean things changed quickly
but um
it's almost unbelievable except that he
said it on a video apparently i'm being
told
if it had not been on the video i don't
know if i'd believe it
it's so
it's so crazy
i'll bet there's not one person here
who didn't know it i mean it was
reported as inevitable wasn't it
didn't didn't the news
sort of say it was inevitable i mean i
don't know anybody who said it wasn't
was he really the only person who
thought that
well here's the other possibility the
other possibility is he was lying
right remember biden ran for president
so he'd be the honest one
do you think he was being honest when he
said it's not inevitable that the
taliban would take over
i doubt it
because if he knew it was inevitable
he couldn't leave
so i think he has to
i think he had to lie
and maybe trump would have too
maybe any president would have because
the only place the only way to get from
here to there
was lying
i suppose he told the truth
the truth would have been we're going to
pull out of afghanistan and leave our
allies to be slaughtered
could he say that
yeah you know
it's really tragic our allies will be
slaughtered the country will go to hell
we've wasted 20 years and trillion
dollars
but i'm going to pull out anyway
because it's good for america
that was the truth right
he just couldn't say it
so
the whole point of hiring an honest
president which is what the democrats
believe they were doing well that didn't
work out
he's obviously i would say this is an
obvious lie
because i don't believe
that joe biden
didn't know it was going to be
inevitable do you
how many of you believe that
if you had to choose between those two
hypotheses he was lying because it was
the only way to get it done just the
only way to get it done politically or
he actually was the only person in
america who didn't know it was
inevitable which one of those do you
think is true
i would go for the lie
yeah
um
but weirdly i don't criticize it
isn't that weird
i'm not criticizing him for lying
you know we hire leaders
and we put them in these positions where
sometimes they have to lie to give us
what we want
sometimes we have they have to lie to
give us what we're asking for
and this was an example they had to lie
to us
to make us feel okay doing this because
it was going to be horrible to our
allies
okay i call that an acceptable lie
cnn has turned on biden
and actually used the term botched
about the afghanistan withdrawal
now i feel like that's something we can
all agree on
this would be the one time that the
country could completely come together
this was botched
it was botched and i would say the same
thing no matter who the president was
this is as botched as you can get
and i don't know who's to blame but it
looks pretty bad
apparently biden said ahead of time he
wanted to avoid a vietnam-like scene
with helicopters
taking people off a roof
well he did not do that
it's worse than that
i don't know if you've seen it yet
but there's a video
ah that's really bad
there's a video of a u.s plane taking
off from kabul
the airport is you know swarming with
people who are trying to escape the
country
and some people held on to the outside
of the plane
let me say that again some people held
on to the outside of the plane
and it took off
and you could actually see one of the
bodies falling
i don't know how many there were i could
see one clearly
they wanted to get out of there so badly
they held onto the plane after it took
off i mean just think about that
that that's a level of desperation
that's hard to comprehend
i mean you can't even it's hard to wrap
your brain around that and that's just
so horrible
but uh do you remember uh general milly
when he was talking about all the
wokeness in the military that he likes
he likes that wokeness
and
do you remember what i said about him
when he got a little tv time
does anybody remember me telling you
that general milly looked
like the dumbest person in the world
he looked like the dumbest person in the
world and
it i was talking about a different topic
i wasn't talking about afghanistan but
is this the guy who is responsible for
that
is he the one responsible for this
because it looks like it
it looks like the guy who looked like
the dumbest person in the world actually
was
he actually he is as dumb as he looked
right i mean i you remember i called
that out that he just looked low iq
now i don't say that about people i
dislike politically right
have you ever heard me say that i mean
biden's a special case because of his
age and stuff but you don't hear me
telling saying that the people i
disagree with are stupid
i i don't do that
lots of times they're brilliant
aoc for example i think is brilliant i
just disagree with her on a lot of stuff
but this general milly he just actually
did look dumb
i mean he just oozed the dumbness
and it looks like maybe he's responsible
i don't know now we've got a lot of
blame to spread around biden of course
the you know joint chiefs
uh our intelligence people the
politicians a lot of blame
but i feel like
this guy might have most of it
well china is already announcing that it
wants to work with the taliban
and help them develop afghanistan
a question you might ask yourself is
hmm
has the taliban heard about the uyghurs
or do they even care
you know is the taliban a genuine
organization meaning that it's really
about
their beliefs
or is it just another political
group that wants power and they're just
using their beliefs to get it
well
they're working with china and china is
putting people who believe what they
believe in prison camps
so they're not operating on principle
clearly
they're operating on some kind of
self-interest
model
but
i'm wondering if this isn't biden's
secret plan to destroy china
because
can somebody give me a history lesson
here
is it true or just one of these fake
news kinds of things
when people say that the soviet union
fell in part because of afghanistan is
that true or is that just bad history
somebody give me a
give me a quick history lesson on this
only true for the army as you're saying
but did
did afghanistan contribute to the fall
of uh soviet union
in any significant way i'm seeing some
truths
but i always wonder if that's like fake
news
or maybe maybe it was exaggerated how
much impact that had
how could it not yeah i mean it was
expensive so that alone
yeah so
i'm seeing some no's
i'm not i'm not entirely convinced that
that was the biggest part of why the
soviet union fell but maybe it was part
so here's the good news
uh
china working with the taliban is not
going to be easy
and of course china is going to need to
dominate them
because it tries to dominate everything
and of course the taliban is going to
want to dominate too so how in the world
do they get how do they work together
how in the world could that work
maybe
um but it looks like a secret plan to
destroy china by letting them work with
the taliban
now of course as many of you know
china's interest is probably
further cornering of the rare minerals
market
how many of you know that the
afghanistan is probably about the rare
minerals
they seem to have a lot of them
and china has cornered the market on a
lot of the rare mineral minerals that
the united states needs
so if we want to be a technology power
in the future we need those rare
minerals and china is going to
control them
in afghanistan and everywhere else
yeah there's a one trillion estimated to
be there
in in rem whatever that is arya
and their minerals are easily available
well easily
meaning in terms of mining it's easy
in terms of bullets flying around not so
much
so the rare mineral question is a big
one now here's a adam dopamine
tweeted this
today that nasa is studying a an
asteroid that also has rare minerals in
it
so if we can get to the asteroid with
all of its minerals not all of them are
rare but
some of the good ones are
that here's here's nasa's estimate of
the value of this one asteroid if we
could get to it
700
quintillion dollars
that's the mineral value of one asteroid
700 quintillion
do you understand why billionaires are
going to space
billionaires are going to space
to become quintillionaires
that's right
probably somebody and it may be the next
generation of billionaires i don't know
if we can get there in the next
generation
but at some point
some billionaire is going to land a
mining expedition on an asteroid
and become
a quintillionaire
a quintillionaire would run the world
wouldn't they
if you had a quintillion dollars
uh and of course that's impossible
because you couldn't add that much to
the economy without you know everything
changing
but
uh
there could be a real rich
quintillionaire
maybe maybe a trillionaire
so that's a one of those uh black swan
you don't see it coming could change
everything situations but it's not going
to help us in the near term
so we better figure out how to get some
rare earth minerals
um biden's approval is at its lowest
point i guess according to rasmussen
and rasmussen poll
but i wonder if it could go lower
because i don't think you can
do you
i don't think there's anything that
biden could do
that would get him below about what it
is you know give or take a point because
i feel like the country is so divided
that there's a you know every president
has a lower limit and they just can't go
lower than that because that means
you know their best supporters would
change
and you're really only getting a you
know a slice of the independence and
that's about it
so i don't think his his
approval will go lower than it is it's
about the low as low as anything you get
this is a matt walsh tweet that i
thought summed up afghanistan as well as
i could have ever hoped to say it but he
said it better his tweet he said an
afghan army of three hundred thousand
which had been equipped and trained by
the us for twenty years
fell in two days to a gang of medieval
terrorists who they outnumbered three to
one
and then he said we can't indefinitely
sustain a country that has absolutely no
will to exist in the first place
exactly
exactly you can't help afghanistan
if they don't have the will to
fight for their own whatever now
apparently they have plenty of will to
be taliban
whatever the taliban is doing is working
now by the way do you know another i
haven't seen any reporting on this
but are you aware that the
the bad guys
uh and isis was the famous one for this
they would take some kind of drug that
would make them fearless in battle it
was a some kind of i think it was a
narcotic
but but they commonly took some kind of
drug that made them
you know impervious to fear
which made them impossible to beat
because you couldn't you couldn't make
them afraid by killing a lot of them
they just keep coming
so
i think that drug is a big part of the
story of why a lot a smaller force could
mean a bigger force
but yeah why were we in a country that
didn't have the will to sustain itself
it really didn't it didn't have any
interest in being its own country it
looked like
max abrams had a funny tweet about this
he said i think the cdc was supplying
biden
with intel about kabul
is there any large organization
public organization
that is now that is not thoroughly uh
discredited
is anybody left
what would be a major
american organization
let's say a public organization
that still has any credibility
i would say the military still does
would you agree
our military leaders
got some explaining to do especially
this week
but the the military itself
i would say
still credible
supreme court
we don't like the decision sometimes but
i would say he's still credible
so i think the supreme court
and the military
are holding the country together
that's that's what i think that's what
it feels like
um well the police yes i would say i
think the police are still credible
right
you know
would you agree i mean you could march
all you want about individual tragedies
that happen
they should never have happened but i
think the police are still a credible
organization
you aren't credible if half the country
doesn't trust you
well who would that refer to
um
not yet not the teachers unions not
intel not the government not congress
not the cdc not the world health
organization
credibility is pretty hard to come by
these days
speaking of credibility the white house
press secretary i saw joel quote
uh tweet on this
so jen saki is taking her vacation
at the same time that biden's on
vacation which makes sense
or doesn't
does it make sense that the spokesperson
would be on vacation the same time as
the
president
i guess it could go either way
but
what could be a worse look than the
worst botching of international anything
we've ever had and a president who's on
vacation
that's the worst look now there's some
reporting
that is jill biden
who's the one who
kept joe biden from
talking in public sooner
i wonder if that's true again that's the
kind of news i don't believe you know
just on the surface
but who knows
so have you ever felt more leaderless
than this
isn't this the most leaderless you've
ever felt
like i don't really think anybody's in
charge right now
do you
i mean literally who's in charge
because nobody really believes that
biden has full control of anything
and when he's on vacation it just sort
of raises that question literally who's
in charge
i don't know who's running the country
right now
what would stop china from taking over
taiwan tomorrow
could you imagine a better time to do it
now i don't think it's going to happen
because i mean
that would get pretty pretty bloody
pretty fast
but
if they were looking for an opportunity
to do it
what's better than this week
no i don't think it'll happen
and it would be
horrible if it did
but
we put ourselves in a bad situation here
with our allies
so
we do have to worry about that
apparently uh speaking of how bad china
is
i guess they work with uh
oh oh so in dubai there's a
there's some reporting that there's a
black site
that china uses to you know capture
their dissidents and interrogate them
and stuff
in other countries
so of course china has its own black
sites within its country to interrogate
people in the worst possible way but
apparently they have one in dubai
or at least in the country there
so
that's pretty bad
and why is it that any islamic country
would deal with china
what's up with that
why would any islamic country deal with
them they are literally trying to erase
islam
at least within china and anything that
they control
here's the weirdest story
russia and china did joint military
exercises
did you know that
russia and china
had any kind of military coordination
did you know about that
um
clueless scott there's never any
infighting
i understand
no
um
i tell you that there there's nothing
that annoys me more than somebody
telling me i don't understand something
that everybody understands like a a
comment that i'll get is
scott doesn't understand
the rain clouds create rain
and i think
i think everybody understands that
scott doesn't understand that if you run
over a squirrel
with a car
it's going to hurt the squirrel
actually i do understand that
so whatever it is you think about my
opinion
probably not because of that
so don't tell me what i don't understand
especially when they're easy things to
understand
so russia and china did this joint
military exercise which experts say was
probably just a complete waste of time
because apparently if you're doing joint
military exercises
if you do a choreographed stuff it's
sort of just for politics and show and
propaganda
so you need what they call the the uh
i don't know the free range things where
the military people can make decisions
and see what the other people do and
then maybe you learn something so it
wasn't that kind so it wasn't the the
useful kind of military exercise it was
more for show
but
why in the world
are russia and china coordinating
on what on what exactly
now there was some
some thinking that it was about
terrorism
but do they really need to coordinate
military
for terrorism i mean how much terrorism
is going to happen in either one of
those countries
seems seems like they would just handle
it with their own militaries no matter
what
so it's probably just good politics that
russia and china because they're
neighbors
that they work together on as many
things as they can figure out to work
together it's probably good for both of
them
but here's my take on all this
russia should have been our ally
russia
should be our ally against china now
that's probably too hard for them to do
because they're right you know they have
a border
but
we need to find some way
that rush is on our side militarily
and
it's hard for me to believe that there's
so many things that putin wants
that we don't want that we couldn't find
some way that we're both better off
because i feel like russia they're deal
makers now maybe you can't trust them
that's a separate issue right maybe they
make a deal and you think they'll break
it
but
they're deal makers
and i can't see any scenario in which
we're not better better off
working with ch with russia instead of
against them now china is a different
story
if we worked with china
for the long run
they would be trying to dominate us
and would be probably be dumb to even
try
but
uh i think russia just has interests
that are common with ours or could i
mean right now we're spending all our
time with these cyber attacks against
each other
why
why it's because we're trying to
suppress russia
why
because we think that they're trying to
do bad stuff to us because they are
why
basically
any dispute between russia and the
united states
is completely about what the other one
did yesterday
it has nothing to do with our strategic
interests i don't think
i don't think
because i don't see russia
wanting to conquer
europe
right i mean there are some disputes
about russian-speaking territories and
you know we have to deal with that but
the bigger picture i just think we don't
have enough not in common
so that's just my take on that
and then on election fraud
let's talk about election fraud
as i keep telling you every day that
goes by
without
um
every day that goes by without
confirmation of any kind of election
fraud
probably means there's less likelihood
we'll ever find it
do you agree with that
general statement
that the longer we go without finding
any fraud
the less likely it is there
would you agree now i know there's some
things that they can't look into there's
some stuff that can't be audited et
cetera
but
or let me put it a different way because
yeah you don't know what you don't know
so that's so i guess you could never
know that there's something hiding in
there because you can't water it at all
but
certainly they haven't found it yet
how many would disagree with the
statement
we would know by now
if the audit found the goods
we would know by now even though they
haven't officially announced it how many
agree with that we would know by now
because of a leak
if they had the goods
almost all of you are disagreeing
oh i like this
this is fun um i saw probably
but almost all of you are disagreeing
interesting
all right well i i i like that that's
fun because then you can see you see how
good my predicting is
okay so do we have uh can we say that we
have opposing predictions
so my prediction is that
no election fraud has been found
massive election fraud has been found
yet
right so i'm not talking about whether
something is found still
in the future
i'm saying that as of right now
my prediction is
that nothing will come to the surface
that has found that has been found
already as of the state
anybody anybody want to take the other
side of that
who would take the other side of that
bet so my bet is that nothing has been
found this massive fraud that can be
proven
so far
let's see in your comments
it will never be enough correct
probably right agree
not taking that bet to greed
i'm seeing a little bit of uh
capitulation here
have you ever heard that word
capitulation in terms of uh the stock
market
yeah that's what it looks like it looks
like capitulation i feel as if
the people who were let's say optimistic
if you could call it that
that the audit would find massive fraud
i feel like you're losing your optimism
now right
now keep in mind this was my prediction
yeah
you reframed it
well yeah i did change the question
right
um is he reading locals comments or
youtube both
i can see them both
so
i was getting more comments on locals
agreeing with me
there's a timing difference if you do a
comment on locals i see it almost
immediately
if you do a comment on youtube i think
there's maybe a
20-second delay or something
they have found fraud but they need the
routers to prove it somebody says no
that would be they haven't found fraud
if you still need something to prove it
you haven't found it
we always had suspicions you know there
are plenty of things that look sketchy
but if you still need something to prove
it you haven't found it that's that's my
point now does that mean it's not there
let me say again
my overall opinion of the election the
election is designed
to hide fraud
the election is designed
to hide fraud because you can't audit
parts of it with the digital part
that's a design
um that's a
design choice
it's not an accident
um so if you design something to hide
fraud
and it's a high value target and lots of
people are going to try because it's a
high value target
the the one thing you can say with
certainty is that
at some point it will be
subject to fraud
you just don't know if it happened
already the only thing you don't know
is if it happened already
now that's the mystery we need to solve
and it looks like we're not going to
solve it at least in terms of not going
to find any evidence
scott apparently doesn't realize his
youtube show has an inherent delay
now you may have missed my mocking from
just a moment ago
in which i said
why do people tell me what i don't know
scott doesn't know
that youtube has an inherent delay
yeah i do know that
i do know that now you could call it
inherent or
or any other word but i know that the
system has a delay
um
let's see
i'm gonna i'm gonna have to run in a
little bit i've got something i gotta do
but is there any news that doesn't
involve china being bad
do you notice that
that how much of our news has to do with
china
a lot right
china is either directly or indirectly
either by we have to compete with them
or something about climate change is
changing our energy policy and our
fentanyl you know our homeless and
fentanyl and deaths is about china the
covet is about china the afghanistan is
about china
it's all about china
stop asian hate
stop asian hate
where did you see asian hate
did you imagine that you saw some of
that there you know the united states
has tons of asian americans
all patriots
and
you know has nothing to do with that
right
you know one of the things about
you might not be american whoever said
that
yeah that could be a china troll you're
right but let me explain america
we're not really about that
in terms of our
you know our uh or let's say our point
of view about the outside world
um
it's not anti-asian
the the united states is is a bunch of
muts we're just a bunch of
stuff thrown together
like that's not our deal here
it's about the it's about the government
the chinese people
tremendous people
how many chinese american friends
you know do you have i got lots
right uh family members family members
as well
so
it's definitely not about chinese people
chinese people are awesome
chinese government
well
chinese government not so awesome
and i think the chinese people would
agree with most of that
so definitely not about any
anti-asian anything we don't do that
here
this this is not the live stream where
you're going to see
anti-anything like that
okay
somebody says same with the iranians
love them but cannot stand the ayatollah
yeah if you spend and i don't know why
you state each of you are in of course
but in california you meet tons of
iranian americans
and what do they mostly have in common
they're awesome
they're awesome i'm not maybe it's a
coincidence but it seems like every time
i meet somebody who has some iranian
background you know persian if you
prefer
they're pretty awesome
i know it seems like a pattern that i
recognize
um so it's definitely not about that
all right um
yeah i'm talking about
all right
our government is pretty crappy these
days you know i wonder do you think our
government is actually crappier
oh this rapid test device
or do you think that we just know it now
because i wonder if if anything's ever
been better
i'm seeing on the locals platform where
they can paste pictures into the
comments
there's a covet 19 rapid test device
it looks like chinese lettering on it
where's that from
i'd like to know where that comes from
all right
uh
okay i don't know what some of these
comments are about but i'm going to go
get ready to do something else
and i'm still working on a uh micro
lesson that i'll post on locals about uh
managing your ego
and embarrassment now i've done this
topic before
but there does seem there seems to be a
hunger for it because in my opinion it's
the biggest
biggest problem that bothers you
is is your ego you just don't know it
so i'm gonna do that
um
fairly soon and by the way the part of
the reason that my micro lessons have
slowed down as i'm having house
construction
and it's noisy here most of the day
after i finish this
so it's just not good for filming during
the day
or live streaming
uh any micro lesson on the imposter
syndrome you know i'll work that in
there i'll work that into the same topic
all right that's all i got for now i'll
see you tomorrow thanks
